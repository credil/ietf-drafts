Internet-Draft        Additional Examples For KIs       October 15, 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5280] defines the AKI (Authority Key Identifier) and SKI (Subject
   Key Identifier) certificate extensions.  [RFC5280] describes two
   example mechanisms for generating AKI/SKI values: a 160-bit SHA-1
   (Secure Hash Algorithm) hash of the public key and a four-bit type
   field with the value 0100 followed by the least significant 60 bits
   of the SHA-1 hash.  Both of these mechanisms were designed to be non-
   security critical.  This document defines three additional mechanisms
   for generating Key Identifier values, using SHA-256, SHA-384, and
   SHA-512 [SHS], that are similar to those examples defined in
   [RFC5280].

2.  Additional Methods for Generating Key Identifiers

   [RFC5280] specifies two examples for generating key identifiers from
   public keys.  Four additional mechanisms are as follows:

     1) The keyIdentifier is composed of the leftmost 160-bits of the
        SHA-256 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey
        (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused bits).

     2) The keyIdentifier is composed of the leftmost 160-bits of the
        SHA-384 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey
        (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused bits).

     3) The keyIdentifier is composed of the leftmost 160-bits of the
        SHA-512 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey
        (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused bits).

     4) The keyIdentifier is composed of the hash of the DER-encoding of
        the SubjectPublicKeyInfo value.

Internet-Draft        Additional Examples For KIs       October 15, 2013


4.  Examples

        This section provides some examples.  The keys and SKIs are
        presented in hexadecimal (two hex digits per byte).

        Given the following DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo value
        holding an P-256 ECDSA key:

     30 59
        30 13
           06 07 2A8648CE3D0201    -- id-ecPublicKey
           06 08 2A8648CE3D030107  -- secp256r1
        03 42 00
              04 7F7F35A79794C950060B8029FC8F363A
                 28F11159692D9D34E6AC948190434735
                 F833B1A66652DC514337AFF7F5C9C75D
                 670C019D95A5D639B72744C64A9128BB

   The SHA-256 hash of the 65 bytes 047F7F...BB is:
     BF37B3E5808FD46D54B28E846311BCCE1CAD2E1A62AA9092EF3EFB3F11451F44

   The SHA-1 hash of these 65 bytes is:
     6FEF9162C0A3F2E7608956D41C37DA0C8E87F0AE

   The SHA-256 hash of the 91 bytes 305930...BB is:
     6D20896AB8BD833B6B66554BD59B20225D8A75A296088148399D7BF763D57405

     Using method 1 from section 2, the subjectKeyIdentifier would be:

     30 1D
        06 03 551D0E -- id-ce-subjectKeyIdentifier
        04 16
           04 14 BF37B3E5808FD46D54B28E846311BCCE1CAD2E1A

   Using the 1st method in [RFC5280], the subjectKeyIdentifier would be:

     30 1D
        06 03 551D0E -- id-ce-subjectKeyIdentifier
        04 16
           04 14 6FEF9162C0A3F2E7608956D41C37DA0C8E87F0AE

   Using the 2nd method in [RFC5280], the subjectKeyIdentifier
   extensions would be:

     30 11
        06 03 551D0E -- id-ce-subjectKeyIdentifier
        04 0A
           04 08 46FEF9162C0A3F2E

   Using method 4 from section 2 with SHA-256 and no truncation, the
   subjectKeyIdentifier extensions would be:

     30 29
        06 03 551D0E -- id-ce-subjectKeyIdentifier
        04 22
           04 20 6D20896AB8BD833B6B66554BD59B2022
                 5D8A75A296088148399D7BF763D57405

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5280] apply to certificates.  The
   security considerations of [RFC5758] apply to the hash algorithms.

   While hash algorithms provide preimage resistance, second-preimage
   resistance, and collision resistance, none of these properties are
   needed for key identifiers.

6.  IANA Considerations

   None.
