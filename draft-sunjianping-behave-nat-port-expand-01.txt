Abstract

   This document describes the TCP/UDP port extension (EPORT) model to
   enhance Network Address Translation (NAT)capability.  EPORT based NAT
   helps service provider and enterprise to save mass public IPv4
   addresses with enough application sessions offered at same time.

Internet-Draft          Expand NAT TCP/UDP Ports                Nov 2011


1.  Introduction

   NAT is one of mainstream solutions to save public IPv4 addresses and
   has been employed widely, it maintains address and port mapping
   mechanism to translate between external address port pair and
   internal address port pair.The IANA IPv4 addresses pool has now
   depleted before internet move from IPv4 to IPv6 sufficiently.As a
   result,NAT(NAPT) becomes the important part of IPv6 transitional
   technologies such as DS-lite,NAT444 and NAT64.

   Because TCP or UDP port number length is 2 octets length,for one of
   external public IPv4 addresses there are 65535 TCP or UDP ports at
   most can be used to establish sessions from internal addresses to
   external by NAT device. in consideration of IANA defined port ranges:
   "Well Known Ports" is 0-1023, "Registered" is 1024-49151, and
   "Dynamic and/or Private" is 49152-65535 ,it recommends that NAT
   devices prefer to use the dynamic range first , then Dynamic and/or
   Private range .In fact ,one publice IPv4 address' available NAT
   translation sessions are less than 64511 for TCP or UDP, this number
   seems enough in the past but inadequate when IPv4 address pool
   starvation.  New session fails to establish on NAT device if 2 octets
   port range reached.  IPv6 transitional technologies such as DS-
   lite,NAT444 and NAT64 that relied on NAT will be affected if IPv4
   public address pool ran out .  For example , each internal host
   behind NAT device requires 400 tcp or udp sessions to access
   internet,(it's reasonable because of P2P applications,multi tab web
   client , RSS etc.) one of external public ipv4 address can support
   only 322 internal hosts at most.  ICMP is out of the scope of this
   specification temporary.

   This document specifies TCP/UDP port extension model which focuses on
   extending extra 2 octets tcp/udp port number to IP option named EPORT
   without changes of existing TCP/UDP header and 20 octets fixed IPv4
   header .  EPORT allows a public IP on NAT device to be assigned 4
   octets sessions for internal hosts.Thus one of external public ipv4
   address can support 21102270 internal hosts at most with same session
   requirement for each host described upon.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   The technology described in this document is known as the TCP/UDP

Internet-Draft          Expand NAT TCP/UDP Ports                Nov 2011


   port extension (EPORT) model to enhance Network Address Translation
   (NAT)capability.  The abbreviation EPORT will be used along this
   text.

   This document specifies TCP/UDP port extension model which focuses on
   extending extra 2 octets tcp/udp port number to IP option named
   EPORT.

   UDP is defined in [RFC768].

   TCP is defined in [RFC793].

   IP option related terminology is defined in [RFC 791].

   NAT related terminology is defined in [RFC4787].

   In this document, the term "NAT" refers to "Network Address/Port
   Translator (NAPT)" that multiple internal hosts share a single public
   IP address simultaneously.  When an internal host opens an outgoing
   TCP or UDP session through a NAPT, the NAPT assigns the session a
   public IP ddress and port number, so subsequent response packets from
   the external host can be received by the NAT device, translated, and
   forwarded to the internal host based on the address port mapping
   table it maintainces .

   Term "session" is defined in RFC 2663.

   The process of IP option by protocol stack is defined in [RFC 1122]
   Term "Shared Public address" and "external public ipv4 address" has
   same signification in this ducoment that means NAT translation
   involved public ip address .


3.  Deployment

3.1.  EPORT IP option defination

   This document defines a new IP option named EPORT option(Extended
   TCP/UDP PORT).  When NAT device's availabe public IP address,public
   port number pairs are used up(It means that NAT device cannot
   translate TCP/UDP sessions any more and its capability is full),EPORT
   option is inserted by the NAT device into TCP/UDP packets' IP header
   to expand existing TCP/UDP port numbers.

   EPORT option includes an option-type octet, an option-length octet,
   and the 2 octets option-data according as Case 2 format defined in
   RFC 791 and exhibit below :

   fragmentation.

   2 bits option class: 01 drawed out from reserved IP option Classes.

   5 bits option number:00001 defined as EPORT id.

   LENGTH option 8bit:00000100,the EPORT option's total length is 4
   octetes.

   option-data 16bit: EPORT ID is 2 octets length.  EPORT id is
   assembled with traditional TCP/UDP port number (as defined in RFC
   793,RFC 768) to identify a unique TCP/UDP session by NAT device and
   external public hosts.Loading EPORT ID breaks the 2 octets port
   preserving limitation of traditional TCP/UDP port number and offers
   sufficient outbound TCP/UDP sessions translated by NAT device.  EPORT
   ID MUST conjunct with public IP address, public port number pairs to
   identify a unique TCP/UDP session.

3.2.  Elements description and behaviors

   The involved elements of NAT TCP/UDP ports expanding are internal
   hosts,NAT device,internet intermedia router and external host.
   Internal hosts are assigned the private IP addresses mainly through
   DHCPv4 by enterprise or ISP's DHCP server or BRAS.  Internal hosts
   can open multiple TCP/UDP sessions simultaneously through the NAT
   device to access internet service such as WEB,MAIL etc.  The NAT
   device has one or more shared public addresses to establishes NAT
   sessions to translate the private IP address,private port number pair
   to a public IP address, public port number pair , and vice versa for
   the duration of the session as defined in RFC 4787.  If NAT device's
   availabe public IP address,public port number pairs (64511 pairs for
   1 shared public IP address at most as described upon )are occupied

   entirely, subsequent sessions initiated by internal hosts will be
   refused or preempting sessions in process.  In this documents ,NAT
   device tags the EPORT IP option with public port number ,public IP
   address to translate and forward traffic correctly.  Internet
   intermedia router is a universal internet router with public
   interface IP addresses which takes charge of packet lookup and
   transmission to next hop.External host is any internet host with
   public IP address .(A internet web server for simplicity)

3.2.2.  Internal host

   Internal host is assigned with private IP address.  Internal host
   MUST implement EPORT option,(The options may appear or not in
   datagrams.  They must be implemented by all IP modules . from RFC791)
   in spite of unnecessary in this document.When internal host receive a
   IPv4 packet with EPORT option ,it MAY silently ignore EPORT option
   part.  Internal hosts MUST NOT insert EPORT option into any packet it
   sends.  Internal hosts act as private hosts described in RFC 2663.

   In Figure 2,Host A and Host B are internal hosts , in order to
   exhibit more points, Host A and Host B visit the same server C's HTTP
   service at this scenario(As Figure 2 upon).

3.2.3.  NAT device

   NAT device recieves the tcp/udp packets from internal hosts then:

   Case 1.  If NAT device' shared Public address' port numbers have not
   run out,it MUST translate Private IP address,private port number
   pairs to shared public IP address,public port number pairs at
   normally( as RFC 2663 describes).The NAT device SHOULD NOT insert
   EPORT option into the IP packet it translated.

   Case 2.  If NAT device' shared Public address' port numbers have run
   out,it MUST insert EPORT option between IPv4 basic header and TCP/UDP
   header into packets for subsequent sessions.Therefor NAT device
   translates subsequent sessions expanding to 4 octet which EPORT ID
   cumulated with 2 octets inherent public port number.  No matter NAT
   device' shared Public address' port numbers have run out or not,it
   MUST maintaince a mapping table with 6 elements below ,then translate
   and forward packets to the proper next hop:

   The EPORT ID after translation block is newly added ,it is padded all
   zero in Case 1 and actual number in Case 2.  The EPORT MAY be
   assigned in order from low to high bits or by other algorithms which
   is out of the scope of this document.

   When returning packets include EPORT option,NAT device MUST lookup
   mapping table with 6 elements described upon to decide the unique
   session and forward it to the proper internal receiver.If no match
   entry found, NAT device SHOULD drop the returning packet .

   Before the NAT device forwards returning packet to the proper
   internal receiver ,it SHOULD check packet's EPORT option ,if exists,
   the NAT device SHOULD wippe off the EPORT option from packet.

   It's NAT device's responsibility to insert EPORT for incoming
   packets,maintain the NAT mapping table ,wipe off returning packet's
   EPORT option and forward packet.

   In Figure 2, Host A opened a session to Server C, the NAT device
   translates its src IP:src port from src:10.1.0.1:6000 to src:
   218.80.254.1:65535,it implies that all of Shared Public address' port
   number ran out and no subsequent sessions will be translated by NAT
   device without EPORT option.

   At this time Host B also opened a session to Server C at the same dst
   port,the NAT device translates src IP:src port from src:10.100.0.1:
   500 to src:218.80.254.1:100:65535(IP:EPORT:src port) and forwards to
   intermedia router.

   After NAT device received the returning packet from Server C to Host
   B with EPORT option,it lookups the NAT mapping table then wippes off

   the EPORT option , translates packet's dst IP:EPORT:dst port from
   dst:218.80.254.1:100:65535 to dst:10.100.0.1:500 then forwards to
   Host B.

3.2.4.  Internet intermedia router

   Internet intermedia router also MUST support EPORT option but SHOULD
   NOT change the EPORT option without justified reason.(Hierarchical
   NAT for example )

   Internet intermedia router MUST forward the IPv4 packets with EPORT
   option.

3.2.5.  External host

   External host MUST implement the EPORT option.

   The interface between the IP layer and the transport layer MUST
   provide full access to all the mechanisms of the IP layer, including
   option.  The transport layer MUST either have mechanisms to set these
   interface parameters, or provide a path to pass them through from an
   application, or both.  (From RFC 1122) This document follows the
   criterion upon , EPORT option MUST be passed throuth TCP/UDP between
   IP header and applications.

   External host MUST indentify the EPORT option ,the packet with
   different EPORT ID will be identified from heterogeneous sessions and
   treated differently by applications even these packets have same TCP/
   UDP port number.

   External host MUST be allowed to respond to requests from same src
   IP,src port but with different EPORT ID.

   External host MUST hold the EPORT option and replicate it to the
   returning packets of corresponding session same as it has ever been
   received .

   EPORT Option is not a end to end parameter ,it is assembled by NAT
   device at the begining, passes through the intermedia routers ,
   identified ,held and returned by external hosts , stripped off by NAT
   device at last.

   In Figure 2, Server C treats packets from Host A(src:218.80.254.1:
   65535,dst:202.100.0.1:80 pair)and from Host B(src:218.80.254.1:100:
   65535 ,dst:202.100.0.1:80 pair) as different sessions and hold EPORT
   ID 100 for the session from Host B.

   When responds to Host B ,Server C copy the EPORT option back into

   packet header(EPORT ID is 100),because NAT device need EPORT ID to
   lookup mapping table and translate packet back to internal host B.


4.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to acknowledge many helpful discussions with
   Gj.  Huang.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This draft request IANA to allocate a reserved IP option from IP
   OPTION NUMBERS.  The suggested Option Type value is 161 in this
   document but can be assigned by IANA from IP Option class 0 or 2 .


6.  Security Considerations

   Security issues of NAT have been documented at [RFC2663] and
   [RFC2993].  In this document the EPORT option is inserted by NAT
   device into IPv4 header and transmited through internet to external
   host.  If Man-in-the-middle intercepts the packets ,it can forge
   EPORT ID.  When the NAT device receives the packet with EPORT option
   forged,it MUST drop the packet whose EPORT ID don't match the mapping
   table it has established.
