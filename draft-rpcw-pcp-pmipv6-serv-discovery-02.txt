  PCP Server Discovery with IPv4 traffic offload for Proxy Mobile IPv6
                draft-rpcw-pcp-pmipv6-serv-discovery-02

Abstract

   This document proposes a solution to PCP Server Discovery problems in
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) networks when both home network traffic
   and traffic off-loaded to local access network require traversing a
   gateway implementing NAT and/or Firewall.  This draft proposes
   enhancements to DHCPv4 Relay Agent by introducing a new sub-option
   under DHCPv4 Relay Option and to PMIPv6 signaling through additional
   options to Proxy Binding Update/Acknowledgement messages.

Internet-Draft       PCP Server Discovery for PMIPv6       February 2013


1.  Introduction

   Given the exponential growth in the mobile data traffic, Mobile
   Operators are looking for ways to offload some of the IP traffic
   flows at the nearest access edge that has an Internet peering point.
   This approach results in efficient usage of the mobile packet core
   and helps lower the transport cost.
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option] defines a way to signal the
   Traffic Offload capability of a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to the
   Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in Proxy Mobile IP Networks.  There are
   scenarios in PMIPv6 Mobile Networks where the traffic going through
   the Mobile Packet Core as well as the traffic that is off-loaded to
   the Local Access Networks end up going through a NAT or Firewall
   gateway.  If the mobile node applications desire to find or control
   the external addresses assigned to the internal address used by the
   Mobile Node (MN), it could be achieved by having a Port Control
   Protocol (PCP) Client on the mobile node.

   [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6) options to
   configure hosts with Port Control Protocol (PCP) Server addresses.
   However, PCP Client on the mobile node will not know whether a flow
   will traverse the Mobile Packet Core or will get offloaded at the
   local access network and hence will not know which PCP server to send
   its queries to.  Even if the mobile node tries to find its PCP server
   using DHCP, it may only find out about the PCP server in the Home
   Network since the source of information is the DHCP server in the
   Home Network.  The mobile node may never learn the presence of the
   PCP server in the Local Access Network.  This requires mobile access
   gateway to act as a PCP Proxy for the PCP server in the mobile node's
   home network and as a PCP server/PCP Proxy for the NAT that the
   offloaded traffic at the Local Access Network have to traverse
   through.  However, this alone does not solve this problem since the
   mobile node needs to be informed of the PCP proxy on the MAG.  This
   draft proposes an extension to DHCPv4 Relay Information Option and
   PMIPv6 Options to achieve these objectives.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213], [RFC5844].  This note also uses terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

   Additionally, this document uses the following abbreviations:

   o  IP Flow - IP Flow represents a set of IP packets that match a
      traffic selector.  The selector is typically based on the source
      IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port
      and other fields in upper layer headers.

   o  IP Traffic Offload - The approach of selecting specific IP flows
      and routing them to the local network, as supposed to tunneling
      them to the home network.

   o  NAT (Network Address Translation) - Network Address Translation
      [RFC2663] is a method by which IP addresses are mapped from one
      address realm to another, providing transparent routing to end
      hosts.

   o  Firewall (FW) - A packet filtering device that matches packets
      against a set of policy rules and applies the actions.

   o  peer-to-peer (P2P) - Applications and protocols, such as
      teleconferencing, multiplayer online gaming, BitTorrent etc

   o  Internal Address - The address of Mobile Node assigned by the home
      agent.

   o  Remote Peer IP Address - The address of a Remote Peer, as seen by
      the Mobile Node.  A Remote Address is generally a publicly
      routable address.

   o  External Address - The address of the Mobile Node as seen by other
      Remote Peers on the Internet with which the Mobile Node is
      communicating, after translation by any NAT gateways on the path.


3.  Solution overview

   The following illustrates a scenario where the Mobile Node is a PCP
   client, Mobile Access Gateway in the access network is a PCP server
   with PCP proxy functionality [I-D.ietf-pcp-proxy], the home network
   has a PCP server.

   Mobile access gateway has the ability to offload some of the IPv4
   traffic flows based on the traffic selectors it receives from the
   local mobility anchor.  Using IP Traffic Offload Selector option
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option] mobile access gateway will
   negotiate IP Flows that can be offloaded to the local access network
   or internet.  For example, consider a mobile node acting as both
   client and server for FTP, VoIP and P2P. In this case FTP flows for



Reddy, et al.            Expires August 15, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       PCP Server Discovery for PMIPv6       February 2013


   that mobility session may be offloaded at the mobile access gateway
   and P2P, Voice over IP (VoIP) flows tunneled back to the local
   mobility anchor.  Mobile node uses PCP to create mappings between
   external IP address/port and internal IP address/port.  These
   mappings will be used for successful inbound communication destined
   to the mobile node behind NAT and/or firewall.

   The mobile node learns the PCP server domain name from DHCPv4 server
   using DHCPv4 option OPTION_PCP_SERVER [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp].  If IP
   Flows are offloaded at the mobile access gateway then the mobile node
   needs to learn the domain name of the mobile access gateway acting as
   PCP proxy.  Mobile access gateway will compare the Remote Peer IP
   Address and Port fields set in PCP PEER request from the mobile node
   with the Traffic Selector fields and IP Traffic Offload Mode Flag in
   IP Traffic Offload Selector Option to determine if the dynamic
   outbound mapping is to be created in the local access network or home
   network.  In case of PCP MAP request mobile access gateway will
   compare the Remote Peer IP Address and Port fields in FILTER Option
   with the Traffic Selector fields and IP Traffic Offload Mode Flag in
   IP Traffic Offload Selector Option to determine if dynamic outbound
   mapping is to be created in the local access network or home network.
   For PCP MAP request without FILTER option since the Remote Peer IP
   Address is not available the mobile access gateway will function as a
   PCP proxy and forward the PCP MAP request to the PCP server in the
   home network.  Mobile Nodes which require communication with well
   known peers (For e.g. applications like SIP proxy, FTP server) will
   use PCP MAP with FILTER option.  When MNs act as servers (such as P2P
   server, Web Server) i.e., when the remote peer IP address is not
   known, PCP client will use PCP MAP request in which case the MAG
   cannot make a decision as per the traffic selector fields and hence
   will relay the request to a PCP server based on local configuration.

   If the dynamic outbound mapping is for Internet Offload, then the
   mobile access gateway will function as a PCP server for the mobile
   node if the NAT is co-located on the MAG.  If the NAT is not co-
   located, then MAG will act as a proxy and forward the PCP requests to
   the respective PCP server in the Local Access Network.

   NAT may not always be required for traffic offloaded for local
   access.  If there is NAT required for traffic offloaded for Local
   Access, then, the dynamic outbound mapping is for the Local Access
   Network.  In this case, the Mobile Access Gateway will function as a
   PCP server if NAT device for the Local Access Network is co-located
   on the MAG, otherwise, it will act as a PCP proxy forwarding the PCP
   requests to the respective PCP server on the Local Access Network.

   If dynamic outbound mapping is for the home network then mobile
   access gateway will function as PCP proxy and forward the accepted

   Reserved (R):  This 16-bit field is unused for now.

   PCP Server Domain Name:   The domain name of the PCP Server to be
      used by the mobile access gateway.  The domain name is encoded as
      specified in Section 8 of [RFC3315].


5.  DHCPv4 Relay Agent co-located with MAG

   When DHCPv4 Relay Agent is co-located with the mobile access gateway,
   the proposal is for the relay agent to influence the DHCPv4 Server to
   opt for the PCP server domain name proposed by the Relay Agent over
   the one configured on the DHCPv4 Server.  The DHCPv4 Relay Agent will
   insert a a new suboption under relay agent information option
   indicating the domain name of the appropriate PCP server/proxy only
   after successful Tunnel/Route setup.  For this to happen, the MN MUST
   ensure that it includes OPTION_PCP_SERVER in the Parameter Request
   List Option in the DHCPv4 Discover/Request message.  The mobile
   access gateway will also have to act as a PCP-Proxy in this case so
   that it can handle PCP Servers of both the local access network and
   the home network.  This will ensure that the right PCP Server is
   picked by the proxy based on IP Flow.

5.1.  Format

   To realize the mechanism described above, the document proposes a new
   PCP Server suboption for the DHCPv4 relay agent information option
   that carries the domain name of PCP Server/Proxy.

   Length:   Includes the length of the "PCP Server Domain Name" field

   PCP Server Domain Name:  The domain name of the PCP Server to be used
      by the PCP Client when issuing PCP messages.  The domain name is
      encoded as specified in Section 8 of [RFC3315].

5.2.  Relay Agent behavior

   DHCPv4 relay agents MAY be configured to include a PCP Server
   suboption if they include a relay agent information option in relayed
   DHCPv4 messages.  The PCP Server Domain name is assigned and
   configured through mechanisms that are outside the scope of this
   memo.

5.3.  DHCPv4 Server behavior

   This suboption provides additional information to the DHCP server.
   Upon receiving a DHCPv4 Discover/Request containing the suboption,
   the DHCPv4 server, if configured to support this suboption, MUST
   populate the DHCPv4 Offer/Ack with the suggested PCP server domain
   name overriding any other PCP server domain name configuration that
   it may already have.  There is no special additional processing for
   this suboption.


6.  DHCPv4 Server co-located with MAG

   When the DHCPv4 Server is co-located with the mobile access gateway,
   the DHCPv4 Server will have to provide the appropriate PCP server
   domain name in the DHCP Offer/Ack based on traffic offload
   negotiation between the mobile access gateway and local mobility
   anchor.

   If traffic offload is successfully negotiated between the mobile
   access gateway and the local mobility anchor, the proposal is for the
   DHCPv4 Server to include the domain name of the PCP Proxy in the DHCP
   Offer/Ack. The mobile access gateway will act as a PCP-Proxy in this
   case to ensure that it can handle PCP Servers of both the local
   access network and the home network.  This will ensure that the right
   PCP Server is picked by the proxy based on IP Flow.

   If traffic offload is not negotiated between the mobile access
   gateway and the local mobility anchor, the proposal is for the DHCPv4
   Server to include the domain name of the home network PCP server in
   the DHCPv4 Offer/Ack. The domain name of the PCP server in the home
   network is obtained from Proxy Binding message exchange explained in
   Section 4.  Option OPTION_PCP_SERVER will be used as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp].

7.  Security Considerations

   The Capability Exchange option defined in this specification is for
   use in Proxy Binding Update messages.  The PCP server option defined
   in this specification is for the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages.  These options are carried like any other mobility header
   option as specified in [RFC5213] and does not require any special
   security considerations.  When IPv4 traffic offload support is
   enabled for a mobile node, the mobile access gateway selectively
   offloads some of the mobile node's traffic flows to the local access
   network.  Typically, these offloaded flows go through a NAT gateway
   and that essentially introduces certain vulnerabilities which are
   common to any NAT deployment.  These vulnerabilities and the related
   considerations have been well documented in the NAT specification
   [RFC2663].  There are no additional considerations above and beyond
   what is already documented by the NAT specifications and which are
   unique to the approach specified in this document.

   The security considerations in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] ,
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-proxy] and section 5 of [RFC3046] also apply to this
   use.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines two new Mobility Header options -
   Capability Exchange option, PCP server option.  These options are

   described in Section 4.  The Type value for this option needs to be
   assigned from the same numbering space as allocated for the other
   mobility options [RFC6275].

   IANA is requested to assign a suboption number for the PCP Server
   Suboption from the DHCP Relay Agent Information Option [RFC3046]
   suboption number space.
