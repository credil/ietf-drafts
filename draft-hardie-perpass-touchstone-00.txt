1.  Introduction

   It has become public knowledge that multiple national governments
   have severally and together engaged in pervasive monitoring of
   Internet communications.  By reducing expectations of privacy for
   Internet-based communication, this surveillance circumscribes the
   conditions under which users will feel it is safe or appropriate to
   use the network.  This state surveillance thus amounts to an attack
   on the value of the Internet, as it reduces the network effect of
   each user's participation.  This document argues that it is the
   responsibility of the Internet engineering community to restore that
   trust and proposes a touchstone or litmus test for protocols and
   systems intended for Internet scale.

2.  Motivation

   Surveillance gives rise to self-censorship.  Because the Internet is
   one of a very few global communication technologies, the impact of
   pervasive surveillance on it is self-censorship on a scale that harms
   humanity as a whole.  Individuals who would use the network to speak
   may remain mute.  Both within and among nations, communities which
   would otherwise form or grow may be retarded in their emergence or
   completely silenced.  The scope of human interconnection is being
   damaged by these actions, and it must be restored.

3.  What is to be done?

   The Internet must change to respond to pervasive monitoring.  Where
   protocols have traditionally mandated the implementation of integrity
   protection and confidentiality but not mandated their use, the use of
   techniques to achieve these must become a baseline expectation.
   Mechanisms to detect forgery of credentials must be improved and
   deployed.  We must consider more carefully and more consistently the
   effects of information leakage by DNS and other infrastructure.
   Review and re-review of the components and systems which enable
   confidentiality and integrity protection must become a norm.

4.  A personal touchstone

   Beyond these thoughts of the Internet infrastructure changes required
   to restore trust in the network, I believe Internet engineers need to
   have a focus on the users of their systems and protocols in order to
   see the impact of the tradeoffs they are making.  An example for me
   is this:

   "Can a gay kid in Uganda use this safely?"

   If the answer to that is "yes", chances are it meets a reasonable set
   of confidentiality and integrity requirements.  If the answer is
   "no", the default response for me will be to take it back to the
   forge for a bit more fire and shaping.  In extraordinary
   circumstances, another response would be a very strong statement of
   the limits on when this tool could be used.

   Obviously, there are many possible litmus tests which could be
   applied.  I have chosen this one in part because Uganda has a
   challenging network environment where it would be tempting to
   optimize network capacity or locality in ways which risk privacy.  I
   have chosen it in part because gay people are a target of state
   suspicion or action in multiple countries.  Mostly, though, I have
   chosen it because gay kids who find no community kill themselves in
   shocking numbers.  There can be for me no better call to action to
   restore the human communication that this monitoring costs.

   As noted above, this is a personal touchstone, and it may not be 
   appropriate for all readers, all circumstances, or the community 
   as whole.  I believe, however, that considering the impact of 
   pervasive surveillance is difficult in part because its effects
   are diffused across the whole network. Focusing on a touchstone
   user or class of users can help focus consideration of the impact
   of protocol choices or system design decisions.  I encourage 
   readers making such choices to choose their own.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document asserts that mandatory to implement security is too
   weak a response to pervasive surveillance, and it proposes that
   confidentiality and integrity protection become the norm.  It also
   suggests that the balance between confidentiality and other
   optimizations needs to be seriously reconsidered by the Internet
   community as a whole.  

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA
