    Multicast transition path optimization in IPv4 and IPv6 networks
            draft-zhou-mboned-multrans-path-optimization-01

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism to optimize the path between the
   multicast router and multicast source in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
   The basic idea is that when a multicast translation router has an
   IPv4 path and an IPv6 path to the same multicast data source, and
   both IPv4 and IPv6 joins are received, only one path is used.  One
   path is pruned, instead of the same traffic flowing over both v4 and
   v6 paths.  By adding a metric to the IPv4 path, the multicast
   translation router can determine which path to receive multicast
   data: IPv4 path, IPv6 path or both paths.  Therefore, an optimization
   path will typically be chosen when an identical v4/v6 traffic flow
   exists.

1.  Introduction

   It is common to use multi-access LANs such as Ethernet for transiting
   multicast data in networks.  Section 3.6 of[RFC4601] describes Multi-
   Access Transit LANs.

   The Corresponding solution is provided by using PIM Assert message.
   When duplicate data packets appear on the LAN from different routers,
   these routers notice this and then elect a single forwarder.  This
   election is performed using PIM Assert messages, which resolve the
   problem in favor of the upstream router that has (S,G) state; or, if
   neither or both router has (S,G) state, then the problem is resolved
   in favor of the router with the best metric to the RP for RP trees,
   or the best metric to the source to source-specific trees.

   When IPv4 networks migrate to IPv6 netwroks, it is common that there
   are many IPv4 networks and many IPv6 networks that connected to each
   other.  Then, there will be many multicast translation routers(MTR)
   at the edge of a network.  For robustness, reliability and load
   distribution purposes, MTR function could be implemented in several
   nodes in the network.  MTR can be the mAFTR (Multicast AFTR )
   mentioned in [draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]. mAFTR can
   encapsulate IPv4 multicast data in IPv6 tunnel.  MTR can also be the
   mXlate (Multicast Translator) as mentioned in
   [draft-lee-behave-v4v6-mcast-fwk]. mXlate can translate IPv4
   multicast data to IPv6 multicast data.

   As the result, MTR (mXlate or mAFTR) will have more than one path to
   reach the RP or source S in IPv4 networks and IPv6 networks.  Or in
   other words, they will have two upstream routers: one is IPv6 router,
   and the other is IPv4 router.  MTR can reach the RP or source S by
   both paths.  Since MTR can receive both IPv4 and IPv6 (*,G) (or
   (S,G)) Join request, it needs to select a best path to RP or S in
   both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  When it receives the two same multicast
   data flows via IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, MTR needs to send Prune
   Message to the worse path interface.  Figure 1 shows the scenario
   that MTR can reach source S through both IPv4 path and IPv6 path.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

      mXlate: A multicast translator mentioned in
      [draft-lee-behave-v4v6-mcast-fwk].

      mAFTR: A multicast Address Family Transition Router mentioned in
      [draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast].

3.  Context and Scope

3.1.  Context and Scope

   When IPv4 multicast network migrates to IPv6 multicast network, IPv4
   networks and IPv6 networks will coexist for a long time.  This draft
   describes PIM-SM routers at network edge of IPv4 and IPv6 networks
   during the migration.  Multicast services such as Live TV Broadcast
   may use this technology.

   This document focuses only on the issues of inter-access between IPv4
   multicast networks and IPv6 multicast networks.  The scenarios
   include that an IPv6 receiver gets the multicast data from a IPv4
   source , an IPv4 receiver gets the multicast data from a IPv6 source,
   or both IPv4 and IPv6 receivers get the multicast data from IPv4 or
   IPv6 source.


4.  Solution Overview

   This section gives a sloution for the issues mentioned above.

   Figure 1: MTR can reach IPv4 Source through IPv4 path and IPv6 path

   Figure 1 shows that MTR1 can access IPv4 Source through IPv4 path or
   IPv6 path.MTR1 has two upstream routers, one is IPv4 Router and the
   other is IPv6 Router.  MRT1 receives IPv4 (*,G) or (S,G) Join request
   from IPv4 network and IPv6 (*,G) or (S,G) Join request from IPv6
   network.  MTR1 can send Join request to RP or source S from interface
   connected to IPv4 Router or from interface connected to IPv6 Router.
   MTR1 may also send Join request from both upstream interfaces.  In
   this case, MTR1 need to select a best path to RP or S in both IPv4
   and IPv6 networks.  MTR1 sends Prune Message to the worse path, when
   it receives two identical multicast data flows in IPv4 and IPv6
   upstream interface.  MTR1 may receive two identical multicast data
   flows at the same time and stop interworking multicast data flow
   between IPv4 network and IPv6 network.

   For simplification, we use two virtual Routers to replace MTR1
   Router.  Figure 2 shows that MTR1 can be taken as two virtual
   Routers.  The one on the left is a Virtual IPv4 Router, the one on
   the right is a Virtual IPv6 Router.  Virtual IPv4 Router has an IPv4
   upstream interface X and an IPv4 downstream interface Y. Virtual IPv6
   Router has an IPv6 upstream interface A and an IPv6 downstream
   interface B. The interface between two virtual Routers is V.

   When MTR receives two multicast data flows (one from IPv4 interface
   and the other from IPv6 interface), it compares two flows according
   to [draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] to confirm whether
   they are the same multicast data flows.  If they are the same data

   flows, select one or two.  When MTR Receives a IPv6 (S, G) or (*, G)
   Join, virtual IPv6 Router needs to select an interface to send Join
   message.  The interface can be IPv6 upstream interface A or IPv4
   upstream interface X (via interface V).

4.3.  Solution for selecting interfaces to S or RP

   The steps to select an interface to S or RP.

      1.Set the Metric value m1 for translation or encapsulation from
      IPv4 muticast to IPv6 multicast data.

      2.From interface A connecting IPv6 Router, MTR can get the metric
      m2 to reach S or RP by PIM assert message sent from IPv6 Router.

      3.From interface X connecting IPv4 Router, MTR can get the metric
      m3 to reach S or RP by PIM assert message from IPv4 Router.

      4.When MTR receives a IPv6 PIM Join message, virtual IPv6 Router
      compares m2 and m3+m1.  If m2>m3+m1, sending PIM Join message from
      IPv4 interface; If m2<m3+m1, sending PIM Join message from IPv6
      interface; If m2=m3+m1, MTR can choose interface X or A to send
      PIM Join message.

4.4.  Solution for selecting a multicast data flow from upstream
      interface

   The steps for selecting a multicast data flow from upstream interface

      1.MTR gets two mulitcast flows from IPv6 and IPv4 Router, and two
      multicast data flow are the same multicast data flows as defined
      in [draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].

      2.If virtual IPv6 Router gets multicast data from interface V, it
      will compare m2 and m3+m1 (the value is from last section).

      3.If m2>m3+m1, MTR will send PIM Prune Messages to IPv6 interface
      A; If m2<m3+m1 MTR will send PIM Prune Messages to interfaceX via
      virtual interface V. Then MTR will not translate multicast data
      from IPv4 to IPv6 or encapsulate IPv4 multicast data in IPv6
      packets.  If m2=m3+m1 MTR will choose any interface to receive
      multicast data and send PIM Prune Messages to the other interface.

4.5.  Modifications to mulitcast PIM-SM Router

   The main changes to the edge PIM-SM Router include:

Internet-Draft         Multrans path optimization             March 2012


      Edge PIM-SM Router needs to check multicast data flow from IPv4
      and IPv6 interfaces based on
      [draft-ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] to determine
      whether they are the same multicast data flow.

      Edge PIM-SM Router sends PIM Assert messages via IPv4 and IPv6
      interfaces with different Metric value.

      Edge PIM-SM Router may stop translating/encapsulating IPv4
      multicast flow to IPv6 multicast flow or send Prune Messages to
      stop receiving IPv6/IPv4 multicast flow.
