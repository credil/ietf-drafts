    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>This specification builds on <xref target="RFC5308">IS-IS for
        IPv6</xref> and its extensible TLV. This note defines the sub-TLV for
        an <xref target="RFC2460">IPv6</xref> Source Prefix, to define routes
        from a source prefix to a destination prefix.</t>

        <t>This implies not simply routing "to a destination", but routing "to
        that destination AND from a specified source". It may be combined with
        other qualifying attributes, such as "traffic going to that
        destination AND using a specified flow label AND from a specified
        source prefix". The obvious application is egress routing, as required
        for a multihomed entity with a provider-allocated prefix from each of
        several upstream networks. Traffic within the network could be
        source/destination routed as well, or could be implicitly or
        explicitly routed from "any prefix", ::/0. Other use cases are
        described in <xref
        target="I-D.baker-rtgwg-src-dst-routing-use-cases"/>. If a FIB
        contains a route to a given destination from one or more prefixes not
        including ::/0, and a given packet destined there that has a source
        address that is in none of them, the packet in effect has no route,
        just as if the destination itself were not in the route table.</t>

      <section anchor="extensions" title="Theory of Routing">
        <t>Both IS-IS and OSPF perform their calculations by building a
        lattice of routers and links from the router performing the
        calculation to each router, and then use routes (sequences in the
        lattice) to get to destinations that those routes advertise
        connectivity to. Following the SPF algorithm, calculation starts by
        selecting a starting point (typically the router doing the
        calculation), and successively adding {link, router} pairs until one
        has calculated a route to every router in the network. As each router
        is added, including the original router, destinations that it is
        directly connected to are turned into routes in the route table: "to
        get to 2001:db8::/32, route traffic to {interface, list of next hop
        routers}". For immediate neighbors to the originating router, of
        course, there is no next hop router; traffic is handled locally.</t>

        <t>In this context, the route is qualified by a source prefix; It is
        installed into the FIB with the destination prefix, and the FIB
        applies the route if and only if the IPv6 source address also matches
        the advertised prefix. Of course, there may be multiple LSPs in the
        RIB with the same destination and differing source prefixes; these may
        also have the same or differing next hop lists. The intended
        forwarding action is to forward matching traffic to one of the next
        hop routers associated with this destination and source prefix, or to
        discard non-matching traffic as "destination unreachable".</t>

        <t>LSAs that lack a source prefix sub-TLV match any source address
        (i.e., the source prefix TLV defaults to ::/0), by definition.</t>

        <?rfc needLines="5" ?>

        <section title="Notation">
          <t>For the purposes of this document, a route from the prefix A to
          the prefix B (in other words, whose source prefix is A and whose
          destination prefix is B) is expressed as A-&gt;B. A packet with the
          source address A and the destination address B is similarly
          described as A-&gt;B.</t>
        </section>

        <?rfc needLines="5" ?>

        <section title="Dealing with ambiguity">
          <t>In any routing protocol, there is the possibility of ambiguity.
          For example, one router might advertise a fairly general prefix - a
          default route, a discard prefix (which consumes all traffic that is
          not directed to an instantiated subnet), or simply an aggregated
          prefix while another router advertises a more specific one. In
          source/destination routing, potentially ambiguous cases include
          cases in which the link state database contains two routes A-&gt;B'
          and A'-&gt;B, in which A' is a more specific prefix within the
          prefix A and B' is a more specific prefix within the prefix B.
          Traditionally, we have dealt with ambiguous destination routes using
          a "longest match first" rule. If the same datagram matches more than
          one destination prefix advertised within an area, we follow the
          route with the longest matching prefix.</t>

          <t>With source/destination routes, as noted in <xref
          target="I-D.baker-rtgwg-src-dst-routing-use-cases"/>, we follow a
          similar but slightly different rule; the FIB lookup MUST yield the
          route with the longest matching destination prefix that also matches
          the source prefix constraint. In the event of a tie on the
          destination prefix, it MUST also match the longest matching source
          prefix among those options.</t>

          <t>An example of the issue is this. Suppose we have two routes:
          <list style="numbers">
              <t>2001:db8:1::/48 -&gt; 2001:db8:3:3::/64</t>

              <t>2001:db8:2::/48 -&gt; 2001:db8:3::/48</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>and a packet <list style="empty">
              <t>2001:db8:2::1 -&gt; 2001:db8:3:3::1</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>If we require the algorithm to follow the longest destination
          match without regard to the source, the destination address matches
          2001:db8:3:3::/64 (the first route), and the source address doesn't
          match the constraint of the first route; we therefore have no route.
          The FIB algorithm, in this example, must therefore match the second
          route, even though it is not the longest destination match, because
          it also matches the source address.</t>
        </section>

        <?rfc needLines="5" ?>

        <section title="Interactions with other constraints">
          <t>In the event that there are other constraints on routing, such as
          proposed in <xref
          target="I-D.baker-ipv6-isis-dst-flowlabel-routing"/>, the effect is
          a logical AND. The FIB lookup must yield the route with the longest
          matching destination prefix that also matches each of the
          constraints.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="IS-IS-extensions-ipv6" title="Extensions necessary for IPv6 Source/Destination Routing in IS-IS">
        <t>Section 2 of <xref target="RFC5308"/> defines the "IPv6
        Reachability TLV", and carries in it destination prefix
        advertisements. It has the capability of extension, using
        sub-TLVs.</t>

        <t>We define the Source Prefix Sub-TLV as in <xref
        target="IS-IS-source"/>. As noted in <xref target="extensions"/>, any
        IPv6 Reachability TLV that does not specify a source prefix is
        understood to as specifying ::/0 as the source prefix.</t>

      <t>While source/destination routing could be used as part of a security

      or gives a way to prevent communication between systems not included in
      a source/destination route, and in that sense could be considered
      similar to an access list that is managed by and scales with
      routing.</t>
