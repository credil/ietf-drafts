Like the RPKI CP, it is is based on the   template specified in RFC 3647. A number of sections contained in the   template were omitted from this CPS because they did not apply to   this PKI. However, we have retained the section numbering scheme   employed in the RFC to facilitate comparison with the section   numbering scheme employed in that RFC and in the RPKI CP.Kong, Seo & Kent          Expires July 2013                    [Page 7]Internet-Draft        Template CPS for the RPKI            January 20131. Introduction   This document is the Certification Practice Statement (CPS) of <Name   of Organization>.  It describes the practices employed by the <Name   of Organization> Certification Authority (CA) in the Resource Public   Key Infrastructure (RPKI).   These practices are defined in   accordance with the requirements of the Certificate Policy (CP,   [RFC6484]) for the RPKI.   The RPKI is designed to support validation of claims by current   holders of Internet Number Resources (INRs, see definition in Section   1.7) in accordance with the records of the organizations that act as   CAs in this PKI. The ability to verify such claims is essential to   ensuring the unique, unambiguous distribution of these resources   This PKI parallels the existing INR distribution hierarchy. These   resources are distributed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority   (IANA) to the Regional Internet Registries. In some regions, National   Internet Registries (NIRs) form a tier of the hierarchy below the   RIRs for internet number resource (INR) distribution. Internet   Service Providers (ISPs) and network subscribers form additional   tiers below registries.1.1. Overview   This CPS describes:   .  Participants   .  Publication of the certificates and CRLs   .  How certificates are issued, managed, and revoked   .  Facility management (physical security, personnel, audit, etc.)   .  Key management   .  Audit procedures   .  Business and legal issues   This PKI encompasses several types of certificates (see [RFC6480] for   more details):Kong, Seo & Kent          Expires July 2013                    [Page 8]Internet-Draft        Template CPS for the RPKI            January 2013  . CA certificates for each organization distributing INRs and for     each subscriber INR holder)  . End entity (EE) certificates for organizations to use to validate     digital signatures on RPKI-signed objects (see definition in     Section 1.7).  . In the future, the PKI also may include end entity certificates in     support of access control for the repository system as described in     2.4.1.2. Document Name and Identification   The name of this document is ''<Name of Organization>'s Certification   Practice Statement for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure   (RPKI)''.1.3. PKI Participants   Note that in a PKI, the term ''subscriber'' refers to an individual or   organization that is a subject of a certificate issued by a CA. The   term is used in this fashion throughout this document, without   qualification, and should not be confused with the networking use of   the term to refer to an individual or organization that receives   service from an ISP. In such cases the term ''network subscriber'' will   be used. Also note that, for brevity, this document always refers to   PKI participants as organizations or entities, even though some of   them are individuals.       1.3.1. Certification Authorities   <Describe the CAs that you will operate for the RPKI.  One approach   is to operate two CAs: one designated ''offline'' and the other   designated ''production.'' The offline CA is the top level CA for the   <Name of Organization> portion of the RPKI. It provides a secure   revocation and recovery capability in case the production CA is   compromised or becomes unavailable. Thus the offline CA issues   certificates only to instances of the production CA; and the CRLs it   issues are used to revoke only certificates issued to the production   CA. The production CA is used to issue RPKI certificates to <Name of   Organization> members, to whom INRs have been distributed.>       1.3.2. Registration Authorities   <Describe how the registration authority function is handled for the   CA(s) that you operate.

The RA function MUST be provided by the same entity   operating as a CA, e.g., entities listed in Section 1.3.1. An entity   acting as a CA in this PKI already has a formal relationship with   each organization to which it distributes INRs. These organizations   already perform the RA function implicitly since they already assume   responsibility for distributing INRs.>       1.3.3. Subscribers   Organizations receiving INR allocations from this CA are subscribers   in the RPKI.       1.3.4. Relying Parties   Entities or individuals that act in reliance on certificates or RPKI-   signed objects issued under this PKI are relying parties. Relying   parties may or may not be subscribers within this PKI. (See Section   1.7 for the definition of an RPKI-signed object.)       1.3.5. Other Participants   <Specify the entity that operates a repository holding certificates,   CRLs, and other RPKI-signed objects issued by this Organization, and   provide a URL for the repository.>1.4. Certificate Usage       1.4.1. Appropriate Certificate Uses   The certificates issued under this hierarchy are for authorization in   support of validation of claims of current holdings of INRs.   Additional uses of the certificates, consistent with the basic goal   cited above, are also permitted under the RPKI CP [RFC6484].   Some of the certificates that may be issued under this PKI could be   used to support operation of this infrastructure, e.g., access   control for the repository system as described in 2.4. Such uses also   are permitted under the RPKI certificate policy.       1.4.2. Prohibited Certificate Uses   Any uses other than those described in Section 1.4.1 are prohibited.Kong, Seo & Kent          Expires July 2013                   [Page 10]Internet-Draft        Template CPS for the RPKI            January 20131.5.

A CP is a named set of rules that indicates       the applicability of a certificate to a particular community       and/or class of applications with common security requirements.       The CP for the RPKI is [RFC6384].CPS -  Certification Practice Statement. A CPS is a document that       specifies the practices that a Certification Authority employs       in issuing certificates.Kong, Seo & Kent          Expires July 2013                   [Page 11]Internet-Draft        Template CPS for the RPKI            January 2013Distribution of INRs -                          - A process of distribution of the INRs along the       respective number hierarchy. IANA distributes blocks of IP       addresses and Autonomous System Numbers to the five Regional       Internet Registries (RIRs). RIRs distribute smaller address       blocks and Autonomous System Numbers to organizations within       their service regions, who in turn distribute IP addresses to       their customers.IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. IANA is responsible for       global coordination of the Internet Protocol addressing systems       and Autonomous System (AS) numbers used for routing internet       traffic. IANA distributes INRs to Regional Internet Registries       (RIRs).INRs - Internet Number Resources. INRs are number values for three       protocol parameter sets, namely:          . IP Version 4 addresses,          . IP version 6 addresses, and          . Identifiers used in Internet inter-domain routing, currently            Border Gateway Protocol-4 Autonomous System numbers.ISP -         -  Internet Service Provider. An ISP is an organization managing       and selling Internet services to other organizations.NIR -         -  National Internet Registry. An NIR is an organization that       manages the distribution of INRs for a portion of the       geopolitical area covered by a Regional Registry. NIRs form an       optional second tier in the tree scheme used to manage INR       distribution.RIR -   Regional Internet Registry.  An RIR is an organization that       manages the distribution of INRs for a geopolitical area.RPKI-signed object -                        - An RPKI-signed object is a digitally signed data       object (other than a certificate or CRL) declared to be such by       a standards track RFC, and that can be validated using       certificates issued under this PKI.

Publication and Repository Responsibilities2.1. Repositories   As per the CP, certificates, CRLs and RPKI-signed objects must be   made available for downloading by all relying parties, to enable them   to validate this data.   The <Name of Organization> RPKI CA will publish certificates, CRLs,   and RPKI-signed objects via a repository that is accessible via RSYNC   at <insert URL here>. This repository will conform to the structure   described in [RFC6481].2.2. Publication of Certification Information   <Name of Organization> will publish certificates, CRLs and RPKI-   signed objects issued by it to a repository that operates as part of   a world-wide distributed system of RPKI repositories..2.3. Time or Frequency of Publication   <Describe here your procedures for publication (to the global   repository system) of the certificates, CRLs and RPKI-signed objects   that you issue. If you choose to outsource publication of PKI data,   you still need to provide this information for relying parties. This   should include the period of time within which a certificate will be   published after the CA issues the certificate, and the period of time   within which a CA will publish a CRL with an entry for a revoked   certificate, after the CA revokes that certificate.>   The <Name of Organization> CA will publish its CRL prior to the   nextScheduledUpdate value in the scheduled CRL previously issued by   the CA.2.4.

Identification And Authentication3.1. Naming       3.1.1. Types of Names   The subject of each certificate issued by this Organization is   identified by an X.500 Distinguished Name (DN). The distinguished   name will consist of a single Common Name (CN) attribute with a   value generated by <Name of Organization>. Optionally, the   serialNumber attribute may be included along with the common name   (to form a terminal relative distinguished name set), to distinguish   among successive instances of certificates associated with the same   entity.       3.1.2. Need for Names to be Meaningful   The subject name in each subscriber certificate will be unique   relative to all certificates issued by <Name of Organization>.   However, there is no guarantee that the subject name will be globally   unique in this PKI. Also, the name of the subscriber will not be   ''meaningful'' in the conventional, human-readable sense. The rationale   here is that these certificates are used for authorization in support   of applications that make use of attestations of INR holdings.  They   are not used to identify subjects.       3.1.3. Anonymity or Pseudonymity of Subscribers   Although Subject names in certificates issued by this Organization   need not be meaningful, and may appear ''random,'' anonymity is not a   function of this PKI; thus no explicit support for this feature is   provided.       3.1.4. Rules for Interpreting Various Name Forms   None       3.1.5. Uniqueness of Names   <Name of Organization> certifies subject names that are unique among   the certificates that it issues. Although it is desirable that these   subject names be unique throughout the PKI, to facilitate certificate   path discovery, such uniqueness is neither mandated nor enforced   through technical means. <Name of Organization> generates subject   names to minimize the chances that two entities in the RPKI will beKong, Seo & Kent          Expires July 2013                   [Page 15]Internet-Draft        Template CPS for the RPKI            January 2013   assigned the same name. Specifically, <insert subject name generation   description here, or cite RFC 6487.>       3.1.6. Recognition, Authentication, and Role of Trademarks   Because the Subject names are not intended to be meaningful, <Name of   Organization> makes no provision to either recognize or authenticate   trademarks, service marks, etc.3.2. Initial Identity Validation       3.2.1. Method to Prove Possession of Private Key   <Describe the method whereby each subscriber will be required to   demonstrate proof-of-possession (PoP) of the private key   corresponding to the public key in the certificate, prior to   certificate issuance.>       3.2.2. Authentication of Organization Identity   Certificates issued under this PKI do not attest to the   organizational identity of subscribers. However, certificates are   issued to subscribers in a fashion that preserves the accuracy of   distributions of INRs as represented in <Name of Organization's>   records.   <Describe the procedures that will be used to ensure that each RPKI   certificate that is issued, accurately reflects your records with   regard to the organization to which you have distributed (or sub-   distributed) the INRs identified in the certificate. For example, a   BPKI certificate could be used to authenticate a certificate request   that serves as a link to the <Name of Organization's> subscriber   database that maintains the INR distribution records. The certificate   request could be matched against the database record for the   subscriber in question, and an RPKI certificate would be issued only   if the INRs requested were a subset of those held by the subscriber.   The specific procedures employed for this purpose should be   commensurate with any you already employ in the maintenance of INR   distribution.>       3.2.3. Authentication of Individual Identity   Certificates issued under this PKI do not attest to the individual   identity of a subscriber. However, <Name of Organization> maintains   contact information for each subscriber in support of certificate   renewal, re-key, and revocation.Kong, Seo & Kent          Expires July 2013                   [Page 16]Internet-Draft        Template CPS for the RPKI            January 2013   <Describe the procedures that are used to identify at least one   individual as a representative of each subscriber. This is done in   support of issuance, renewal, and revocation of the certificate   issued to the organization. For example, one might say ''The <Name of   Organization> BPKI (see Section 3.2.6) issues certificates that MUST   be used to identify individuals who represent <Name of Organization>   subscribers.'' The procedures should be commensurate with those you   already employ in authenticating individuals as representatives for   INR holders. Note that this authentication is solely for use by you   in dealing with the organizations to which you distribute (or sub-   distribute) INRs, and thus must not be relied upon outside of this   CA/subscriber relationship.>       3.2.4. Non-verified Subscriber Information   No non-verified subscriber data is included in certificates issued   under this certificate policy except for Subject Information Access   (SIA) extensions [RFC6487].       3.2.5. Validation of Authority   <Describe the procedures used to verify that an individual claiming   to represent a subscriber, is authorized to represent that subscriber   in this context. For example, one could say, ''Only an individual to   whom a BPKI certificate (see Section 3.2.6) has been issued may   request issuance of an RPKI certificate. Each certificate issuance   request is verified using the BPKI.'' The procedures should be   commensurate with those you already employ in authenticating   individuals as representatives of subscribers.>       3.2.6. Criteria for Interoperation   The RPKI is neither intended nor designed to interoperate with any   other PKI. <If you operate a separate, additional PKI for business   purposes, e g., a BPKI, then describe (or reference) how the BPKI is   used to authenticate subscribers and to enable them to manage their   resource distributions.>3.3.

If you operate a BPKI, describe how that BPKI is   used to authenticate re-key requests.

Identification and Authentication for Revocation Request   <Describe the procedures used by an RPKI subscriber to make a   revocation request.  Describe the manner by which it is ensured that   the subscriber requesting revocation is the subject of the   certificate (or an authorized representative thereof) to be revoked.   Note that there may be different procedures for the case where the   legitimate subject still possesses the original private key as   opposed to the case when it no longer has access to that key. These   procedures should be commensurate with those you already employ in   the maintenance of subscriber records.>Kong, Seo & Kent          Expires July 2013                   [Page 18]Internet-Draft        Template CPS for the RPKI            January 20134.

Subscriber Private Key and Certificate Usage   The certificates issued by <Name of Organization> to subordinate INR   holders are CA certificates. The private key associated with each of   these certificates is used to sign subordinate (CA or EE)   certificates and CRLs.       4.5.2. Relying Party Public Key and Certificate Usage   The primary relying parties in this PKI are organizations that use   RPKI EE certificates to verify RPKI-signed objects. Relying parties   are referred to Section 4.5.2 of [RFC6484] for additional guidance   with respect to acts of reliance on RPKI certificates.4.6. Certificate Renewal       4.6.1. Circumstance for Certificate Renewal   As per the RPKI CP, a certificate will be processed for renewal based   on its expiration date or a renewal request from the certificate   subject. The request may be implicit, a side effect of renewing a   resource holding agreement, or may be explicit. If <Name of   Organization> initiates the renewal process based on the certificate   expiration date, then <Name of Organization> will notify the   subscriber <insert the period of advance warning, e.g., ''2 weeks in   advance of the expiration date'', or the general policy, e.g., ''in   conjunction with notification of service expiration''.>  The validity   interval of the new (renewed) certificate will overlap that of the   previous certificate by <insert length of overlap period, e.g., 1   week>, to ensure uninterrupted coverage.   Certificate renewal will incorporate the same public key as the   previous certificate, unless the private key has been reported as   compromised.  If a new key pair is being used, the stipulations of   Section 4.7 will apply.       4.6.2.

Certificate Re-key       4.7.1. Circumstance for Certificate Re-key   As per the RPKI CP, re-key of a certificate will be performed only   when required, based on:   1. knowledge or suspicion of compromise or loss of the associated      private key, or   2. the expiration of the cryptographic lifetime of the associated key      pairKong, Seo & Kent          Expires July 2013                   [Page 22]Internet-Draft        Template CPS for the RPKI            January 2013   If a certificate is revoked to replace the RFC 3779 extensions, the   replacement certificate will incorporate the same public key, not a   new key, unless the subscriber requests a re-key at the same time.   If the re-key is based on a suspected compromise, then the previous   certificate will be revoked.   Section 5.6 of the Certificate Policy notes that when a CA signs a   certificate, the signing key should have a validity period that   exceeds the validity period of the certificate.  This places   additional constraints on when a subscriber should request a re-key.       4.7.2. Who May Request Certification of a New Public Key   Only the holder or a certificate may request a re-key. In addition,   <Name of Organization> may initiate a re-key based on a verified   compromise report. <If the subscriber (certificate Subject) requests   the rekey, describe how authentication is effected, e.g., using the   <Name of Registry> BPKI.

Circumstance for Certificate Modification   As per the RPKI CP, modification of a certificate occurs to implement   changes to the RFC 3779 extension values or the SIA extension in a   certificate.  A subscriber can request a certificate modification   when this information in a currently valid certificate has changed,   as a result of changes in the INR holdings of the subscriber or a   change of the repository publication point data.   If a subscriber is to receive a distribution of INRs in addition to a   current distribution, and if the subscriber does not request that a   new certificate be issued containing only these additional INRs, then   this is accomplished through a certificate modification. When a   certificate modification is approved, a new certificate is issued.   The new certificate will contain the same public key and the same   expiration date as the original certificate, but with the incidental   information corrected and/or the INR distribution expanded. When   previously distributed INRs are to be removed from a certificate,   then the old certificate will be revoked and a new certificate   (reflecting the new distribution) issued.       4.8.2. Who May Request Certificate modification   The subscriber or <Name of Organization> may initiate the certificate   modification process. <For the case of the subscriber, state here   what steps will be taken to verify the identity and authorization of   the entity requesting the modification.>       4.8.3.

Circumstances for Revocation   As per the RPKI CP, certificates can be revoked for several reasons.   Either <Name of Organization> or the subject may choose to end the   relationship expressed in the certificate, thus creating cause to   revoke the certificate. If one or more of the INRs bound to the   public key in the certificate are no longer associated with the   subject, that too constitutes a basis for revocation. A certificate   also may be revoked due to loss or compromise of the private key   corresponding to the public key in the certificate.  Finally, a   certificate may be revoked in order to invalidate data signed by the   private key associated with that certificate.       4.9.2. Who Can Request Revocation   The subscriber or <Name of Organization> may request a revocation.   <For the case of the subscriber, describe what steps will be taken to   verify the identity and authorization of the entity requesting the   revocation.>       4.9.3.

Time Within Which CA Must Process the Revocation Request   <Describe your policy on the time period within which you will   process a revocation request.>       4.9.6. Revocation Checking Requirement for Relying Parties   As per the RPKI CP, a relying party is responsible for acquiring and   checking the most recent, scheduled CRL from the issuer of the   certificate, whenever the relying party validates a certificate.       4.9.7. CRL Issuance Frequency   <State the CRL issuance frequency for the CRLs that you publish.>   Each CRL contains a nextScheduledUpdate value and a new CRL will be   published at or before that time. <Name of Organization> will set the   nextScheduledUpdate value when it issues a CRL, to signal when the   next scheduled CRL will be issued.       4.9.8.

These factors can include   the practices followed by the certification authority (CA) in   authenticating the subject; the CA's operating policy, procedures,   and technical security controls, including the scope of the   subscriber's responsibilities (for example, in protecting the private   key), and the stated responsibilities and liability terms and   conditions of the CA (for example, warranties, disclaimers of   warranties, and limitations of liability). This document provides a   framework to address the technical, procedural, personnel, and   physical security aspects of Certification Authorities, Registration   Authorities, repositories, subscribers, and relying party   cryptographic modules, in order to ensure that the certificate   generation, publication, renewal, re-key, usage, and revocation is   done in a secure manner.  Specifically, Section 3 Identification and   Authentication (I&A); Section 4 Certificate Life-Cycle Operational   Requirements; Section 5 Facility Management, and Operational   Controls; Section 6 Technical Security Controls; Section 7   Certificate and CRL Profiles; and Section 8 Compliance Audit and   Other Assessments are oriented towards ensuring secure operation of   the PKI entities such as CA, RA, repository, subscriber systems, and   relying party systems.11.
