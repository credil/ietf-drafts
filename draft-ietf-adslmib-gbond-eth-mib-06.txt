Internet-Draft             G.Bond/Ethernet MIB                March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Ethernet-based xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding, a.k.a.  G.Bond/Ethernet,
   is specified in ITU-T G.998.2 recommendation [G.998.2], which defines
   a method for bonding (or aggregating) of multiple xDSL lines (or
   individual bearer channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bi-
   directional logical link, carrying an Ethernet traffic.

   The MIB module, defined in this document, provides G.Bond/Ethernet
   specific objects for the management of G.998.2 bonded interfaces,
   extending the common bonding objects specified in GBOND-MIB
   [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   Management Framework for xDSL Bonding [TR-159], defining a management
   model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL
   interfaces.

4.  Relation to other MIB modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB), G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB), and EFM Copper MIB (EFM-
   CU-MIB).

Internet-Draft             G.Bond/Ethernet MIB                March 2012


4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB module

   A G.Bond/Ethernet port is a private case of a bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular, an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/Ethernet ports,
   as well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB module

   GBOND-MIB [I-D.ietf-adslmib-gbond-mib] module defines management
   objects common for all bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In
   particular it describes the bonding management, bonded port and
   channel configuration, handshake-based discovery, initialization
   sequence etc.

   Both GBOND-MIB and G9982-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a G.Bond/
   Ethernet port.

4.2.1.  BACP-based Discovery

   All G.998 protocols share a remote Bonding Channel Entity (BCE)
   discovery, using the [G.994.1] handshake (G.hs).  The GBOND-MIB
   module provides an example of an automatic BCE connection to the
   corresponding Generic Bonding Sublayer (GBS) ports of a generic G.998
   multi-port Central Office (CO) device, using the G.hs-based BCE
   discovery.  Amendment 2 to the ITU-T G.998.2 specification
   [G.998.2-Amd2], provides an alternative optional Bonding Aggregation
   Control Protocol (BACP) for in-service discovery, aggregation and
   pair management.

   The following pseudo-code gives the same example of the discovery and
   automatic BCE assignment for a multi-GBS G.Bond/Eth CO device, using
   BACP objects defined in this MIB module, IF-CAP-STACK-MIB and IF-MIB
   modules [Note that automatic BCE assignment is only shown here for
   the purposes of the example.  Fixed BCE pre-assignment, manual
   assignment or auto-assignment using an alternative internal algorithm
   may be chosen by a particular implementation]:

   An SNMP Agent for a G.Bond device builds ifCapStackTable and its
   inverse ifInvCapStackTable on device initialization, according to the
   cross-connect capabilities of the device.  When BACP is used, the
   g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID object identifying bonding eligibility
   MUST be automatically updated, whenever the ifCapStackTable/
   ifInvCapStackTable are changed.

4.3.  Relationship to EFM Copper MIB module

   EFM-CU-MIB [RFC5066] module defines objects for managing Ethernet in
   the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces 10PASS-TS and 2BASE-TL,
   defined in IEEE Std 802.3-2005 [802.3].  These interfaces are based
   on Single-pair High-speed Digital Subscriber Line (SHDSL) [G.991.2]
   and Very High speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) [G.993.1]
   technology respectively, and can be optionally aggregated (bonded).

   ITU-T G.998.2 specification extends the IEEE 802.3 Clause 61 bonding
   to work over any xDSL technology, providing the ability to bond
   individual channels as well as physical lines.  It also allows the
   use of alternative HDLC encapsulation instead of the default 64/
   65-octet encapsulation and adds a new optional Bonding Aggregation
   Control Protocol (BACP) for in-service discovery, aggregation and
   pair management instead of the default G.hs-based bonding protocol,
   which cannot be used in-service, while the link is up.

   EFM-CU-MIB can be used to manage all aspects of the EFMCu physical
   interfaces (PHYs), including a complete (within the scope of the
   802.3 standard) management of the SHDSL/VDSL lines.  GBOND-MIB and
   G9982-MIB modules on the other hand, provide management objects only
   for the bonding part, leaving the management of the individual xDSL
   interfaces (lines/channels) to the respective xDSL-LINE-MIB modules.

   Therefore an IEEE 802.3 2BASE-TL/10PASS-TS interface can be managed
   by either combination of the following MIB modules:

      IF-MIB + IF-CAP-STACK-MIB + EtherLike-MIB + MAU-MIB + EFM-CU-MIB

      IF-MIB + IF-CAP-STACK-MIB + GBOND-MIB + G9982-MIB + HDSL2-SHDSL-
      LINE-MIB/VDSL-LINE-MIB

   Note also that while EFM-CU-MIB relies on ifMauMediaAvailable object
   from MAU-MIB [RFC4836] for the additional bonded xDSL-specific
   operational states, GBOND-MIB provides these indication via
   gBondPortStatOperStatus object, complementing the ifOperStatus object
   from IF-MIB.

   Finally, EFM-CU-MIB does not include historical Performance
   Monitoring (PM), while GBOND-MIB/GBOND-MIB-ETH/xDSL-LINE-MIB

Internet-Draft             G.Bond/Ethernet MIB                March 2012


   combination provides full PM functionality for a bonded link and
   individual xDSL lines.

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   The main management objects defined in the G9982-MIB module are split
   into 2 groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181 [RFC4181]:

   o  g9982Port - containing objects for configuration, capabilities,
      status and PM of G.Bond/Eth ports.  Note that the rest of the
      objects for the Generic Bonded Sub-layer (GBS) port configuration,
      capabilities, status, notifications and PM, is located in the
      GBOND-MIB module.

   o  g9982Bce - containing objects representing OPTIONAL status
      information and BACP configuration for each Bonding Channel Entity
      (BCE).  Note that the rest of the objects for the BCE
      configuration, capabilities, status and notifications, is located
      in relevant xDSL line MIB modules as well as in the GBOND-MIB
      module.

5.2.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL performance monitoring counters, thresholds and history
   buckets (interval-counters), similar to those defined in [TR-159] are
   implemented using the textual conventions defined in the HC-PerfHist-
   TC-MIB [RFC3705].  The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of
   the textual conventions found in PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593].

   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen
   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each one
   day intervals SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when a GBS is reinitialized, but rather only
   when the agent is reset or reinitialized.

5.3.  Mapping of Broadband Forum TR-159 Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [TR-159] and managed objects defined in this
   document.

                Table 1: Mapping of TR-159 Managed Objects

   Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR-159
   and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one-to-one, for
   example, while TR-159 PM attributes aGroupPerf* map to the
   corresponding gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, there are
   no dedicated PM attributes for the g9982PortPm* objects introduced in
   this MIB module.  However, since their definition is identical to the
   definition of gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, we can
   map g9982PortPm* to the relevant aGroupPerf* attributes of TR-159 and
   use the term 'partial mapping' to denote the fact that this mapping
   is not one-to-one.

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Changing of g9982PortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.
      g9982PortConfTcAdminType) may lead to a complete service
      interruption, in case the specified PTM-TC encapsulation type is
      not supported by the remote end.

   o  Changing of g9982BceConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.
      g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID) may lead to preventing a non-bonded
      BCE from being bonded in any bonding group or false advertisement
      of bonding eligibility (e.g. between BCEs residing on different
      line cards in an application which does not support cross-card
      bonding).

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they
   provide information about the performance of network interfaces and
   can reveal some aspects of their configuration.

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly even encrypt the values of these objects
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables
   and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  g9982PortStatTable - objects in this table (e.g.
      g9982PortStatTcOperType) provide status information for the G.Bond

      port, which may aid in deciphering of the G.Bond/ETH
      transmissions.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   An object identifier for g9982MIB MODULE-IDENTITY SHALL be allocated
   by IANA [1] in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree, before this document
   is published as an RFC.
