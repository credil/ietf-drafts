Internet-Draft        Making BGP filtering a habit         February 2013


1.  Introduction

   It is common practice for network operators to propagate overlapping
   prefixes along with the prefixes that they originate.  It is also
   possible for some Autonomous Systems (ASes) to apply different
   policies to the overlapping (more specific) and the covering (less
   specific) prefix.  Some ASes could even benefit from filtering the
   overlapping prefixes.

   BGP makes independent, policy driven decisions for the selection of
   the best path to be used for a given IP prefix.  However, routers
   must forward packets using the longest-prefix-match rule, which
   "precedes" any BGP policy (RFC1812 [4]).  Indeed, the existence of a
   prefix p' that is more specific than a prefix p in the Forwarding
   Information Base (FIB) will let packets whose destination matches p'
   be forwarded according to the next hop selected as best for p' (the
   overlapping prefix).  This process takes place by disregarding the
   policies applied in the control plane for the selection of the best
   next-hop for p (the covering prefix).  When overlapping prefixes are
   filtered and packets are forwarded according to the covering prefix,
   the discrepancy in the routing policies applied to covering and
   overlapping prefixes can lead to a violation of policies of Internet
   Service Providing (ISPs) still holding a path towards the overlapping
   prefix.

   This document presents examples of such threats and discusses
   solutions to the problem.  The objective of this draft is to shed
   light on the use of prefix filtering by making the routing community
   aware of the cases where the effects of filtering might turn to be
   negative for the business of ISPs.

   The rest of the document is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
   some cases in which it is favorable for an AS to filter overlapping
   prefixes.  In Section 3, we provide some scenarios in which the
   filtering of overlapping prefixes lead to policy violations of other
   ASes.  Section 4 and Section 5 discuss some techniques that ASes can
   use for, respectively, detect and react to policy violations.


2.  Filtering overlapping prefixes

   There are several scenarios where filtering an overlapping prefix is
   relevant to the operations of an AS.  In this section, we provide
   examples of these scenarios.  We differentiate cases in which the
   filtering is performed locally from those where the filtering is
   triggered remotely.  These scenarios will be used as a base in
   Section 3 for describing side effects bound with such practices,
   notably policy violations in the ASes surrounding the AS applying the

   procedure.

2.1.  Local filtering

   Let us first analyze the scenario depicted in Figure 1.  AS1 and AS2
   are two large autonomous systems spanning a large geographical area
   and peering in 3 different physical locations.  Let AS1 announce
   prefix 10.0.0.0/22 through the sessions established between the two
   ASes over all peering links.  Additionally, let us define that there
   is part of AS1's network which exclusively uses prefix 10.0.0.0/24
   and which is closer to a peering point than to others.

   To receive the traffic from AS2 to prefix 10.0.0.0/24 on the closer
   link, AS1 could announce the overlapping prefix only over this
   specific session.  At the time of the establishment of the peering,
   it can be defined by both ASes that hot potato routing would happen
   in both directions of traffic.  In other words, it was agreed that
   each AS will deliver the traffic to the other AS on the nearest
   peering link.  In this scenario, it becomes relevant to AS2 to
   enforce such practice by detecting the described situations and
   automatically issuing the appropriate filtering.  In this case, by
   implementing these automatic procedures, AS2 would detect and filter
   prefix 10.0.0.0/24.

                                   `-...-'


              Figure 2: Basic scenario of local filtering - 2

   In this scenario, prefix 10.0.0.0/22 is advertised by AS1 to AS2 and
   AS3.  Both ASes propagate the prefix to AS4.  Additionally, AS1
   advertises prefix 10.0.0.0/24 to AS2, which subsequently propagates
   the prefix to AS4.

   It is possible that AS4 resolves to filter the more specific prefix
   10.0.0.0/24.  One potential motivation could be the economical
   preference of the path via AS2 over AS3.  Another feasible reason is
   the existence of a technical policy by AS4 of aggregating incoming
   prefixes longer than /23.

   The above examples illustrate two of the many motivations to
   configure routing within an AS with the aim of ignoring more specific
   routes.  Operators have reported applying these filters in a manual
   fashion [3].  The relevance of such practice led to investigate
   automated filtering procedures in I-D.WHITE [5].

2.2.  Remotely triggered filtering

   ISPs can tag the BGP paths that they propagate to neighboring ASes
   with communities, in order to tweak the propagation behavior of the
   ASes that handle these paths [1].

   Some ISPs allow their direct and indirect customers to use such
   communities to let the receiving AS not export the path to some
   selected neighboring AS.  By combining communities, the prefix could
   be advertised only to a given peer of the AS providing this feature.
   Figure 3 illustrates an example of this case.

                   Figure 3: Remote triggered filtering

   AS2 and AS3 are peers.  Both ASes are providers of AS1.  For traffic
   engineering purposes, AS1 could use communities to prevent AS2 from
   announcing prefix 10.0.0.0/24 to AS3.

   Such technique is useful for operators to tweak routing decisions in
   order to align with complex transit policies.  We will see in later
   sections that by producing the same effect as filtering, they can
   also lead to policy violations at other, distant, ASes.


3.  Uses of overlapping prefix filtering that violate policies

   In this section we describe three configuration scenarios that lead
   to the violation of the policies of an AS.  Note that these examples
   do not capture all the cases where such policy violation can take
   place.  More examples will be provided in future revisions of this

3.1.  Violation caused by local filtering

   In this section we describe cases in which an AS locally filters an
   overlapping prefix.  We show that, depending on the BGP policies
   applied by surrounding ASes, this decision can lead to a policy
   violation.

3.1.1.  Initial setup

   We start by describing the basic scenario of this case in Figure 4.

   announcing a covering prefix, 10.0.0.0/22, and an overlapping prefix
   10.0.0.0/24 to its providers.  In the initial setup, AS2 and AS3 will
   announce the two prefixes to their peers and transit providers.  AS4
   receives both prefixes from its peer (AS2) and transit provider
   (AS5).  We will consider that AS5 chooses the path through AS3 to
   reach AS1.

   overlapping prefix only from its transit provider, AS5.

   The described example places AS4 in a situation in which it would be
   favorable for it to filter the announcement of prefix 10.0.0.0/24
   from AS5.  Subsequently, traffic from AS4 and heading to prefix
   10.0.0.0/24 is forwarded towards AS2.  Because AS2 receives the more
   specific prefix from AS3, traffic from AS4 and heading to prefix
   10.0.0.0/24 follows the path AS4-AS2-AS3-AS1.  This violates the
   policy of AS2, since it forwards traffic from a peer to a non-

Camilo Cardona & Pierre Francois  Expires August 25, 2013       [Page 9]

   only propagates the overlapping prefix to AS3.  AS4 receives the
   overlapping prefix only from its transit provider, AS5.  This case is
   illustrated in Figure 6.

   Similar to the scenario described in Section 3.1.2, AS4 is in a
   situation in which it would be favorable to filter the announcement
   of prefix 10.0.0.0/24 from AS5.  Subsequently, traffic from AS4 to
   prefix 10.0.0.0/24 is forwarded towards AS2.  Traffic from AS4 and
   heading to prefix 10.0.0.0/24 follows the path AS4-AS2-AS5-AS3-AS1.
   This path violates the policy of AS2, as this AS is forwarding
   traffic from a peer to a transit network.

3.2.  Violation caused by remotely triggered filtering

   We present a configuration scenario in which an AS, using the
   mechanism described in Section 2.2, informs its provider to
   selectively announce an overlapping prefix, leading to the violation
   of the policy of another AS.

3.2.1.  Initial setup

   Let AS1 be a customer of AS2 and AS3.  AS1 owns 10.0.0.0/22, which it
   advertises through AS2 and AS3.  Additionally, AS2 and AS3 are peers.

   Both AS2 and AS3 select their customer path as best, and propagate
   that path to their customers, providers, and peers.  Some remote ASes
   will route traffic destined to 10.0.0.1 through AS2 while others will
   route traffic through AS3.

   Let AS1 advertise 10.0.0.0/24 over AS3 only.  AS3 would propagate
   this prefix to its customers, providers and peers, including AS2.

   From AS2's point of view the path towards 10.0.0.0/24 is a "peer
   path" and AS2 will only advertise it to its customers.  ASes in the
   customer branch of AS2 will receive a path to the /24 that contains
   AS3 and AS2.  Some multi-homed customers of AS2 may also receive a
   path through AS3, but not through AS2, from other peering or provider
   links.  Any remote AS that is not lying in the customer branch of
   AS2, will receive a path for 10.0.0.0/24 through AS3 and not through
   AS2.

   AS2 only receives traffic destined to 10.0.0.0/24 from its customers,
   which it forwards to its peer AS3.  Routing is consistent with usual
   Internet Routing Policies in this case.  AS3 could receive traffic
   destined to 10.0.0.0/24 from its customers, providers, and peers,
   which it directly forwards to its customer AS1.

3.2.3.  Violation of policy by limiting the scope of the overlapping
        prefix

   Now, let us assume that 10.0.0.0/24, which is propagated by AS1 to
   AS3, is tagged to have AS3 only propagate that path to AS2, using the
   techniques described in Section 2.2.

   From AS2's point of view such a path is a "peer path" and will only
   be advertised by AS2 to its customers.

   All ASes that are not customers of AS2 will not receive a path to
   10.0.0.0/24.  These ASes will forward packets destined to 10.0.0.0/24
   according to their routing state for 10.0.0.0/22.

   Let us assume that AS5 is such an AS, and that its best path towards
   10.0.0.0/22 is through AS2.  Then, packets sent towards 10.0.0.1 by
   AS5 will eventually reach AS2.  However, in the data-plane of the
   nodes of AS2, the longest prefix match for 10.0.0.1 is 10.0.0.0/24,
   which is reached through AS3, a peer of AS2.  Since AS5 is not in the
   customer branch of AS2, we are in a situation where AS2 is forwarding
   non customer originated traffic along peering links, which violates
   its policies.

4.  Techniques to detect policy violations

   We differentiate the techniques available for detecting policy
   violations from the cases in which the interested AS is the victim or
   contributor of such operations.

4.1.  Being the victim of the policy violation

   To detect that its policies have been violated, an ISP can monitor
   its traffic data and test if any flow entering the ISP network
   through a non-customer link is forwarded to a non-customer next-hop.

   In the control plane, it is possible for ISPs to identify threats
   using BGP data.  An ISP can seek for overlapping prefixes for which
   the next-hop is through a provider (or peer), while the next-hop for
   their covering prefix(es) is through a client.  Direct communication
   or looking glasses can be used to check whether non-customer
   neighboring ASes are propagating a path towards the covering prefix
   to their own customers, peers, or providers.  This should trigger a
   warning as this would mean that ASes in the surrounding area of the
   current AS are forwarding packets based on the routing entry for the
   less specific prefix only.

4.2.  Being a contributor to the policy violation

   It can be considered problematic to be a contributor of a policy
   violation as it appears as an abuse to the network resources of other
   ISPs.

   There may be justifiable reasons for one ISP to perform filtering,
   either to enforce established policies or to provide prefix
   advertisement scoping features to its customers.  These can vary from
   trouble-shooting purposes to business relationships implementations.
   Restricting such features for the sake of avoiding contributing to
   potential policy violations is a bad option.

   Traffic data does not help an ISP detect that it is acting as a
   contributor of the policy violation.  It is thus advisable to obtain
   as much information as possible about the Internet environment of the
   AS and assess the risks of filtering overlapping prefixes before
   implementing them.

   Monitoring the manipulation of the communities that implement the
   scoping of prefixes is recommended to the ISPs that provide these
   features.  The monitored behavior should then be faced against their
   terms of use.

5.  Techniques to counter policy violations

   Network Operators can adopt different approaches with respect to
   policy violation.  We classify these actions according to whether
   they are anticipant or reactive.

   Reactive approaches are those in which the operator tries to detect
   the situations and solves the policy violation, manually, on a case
   by case basis.

   Anticipant or preventive approaches are those in which the routing
   system will not let the policy violation actually take place when the
   configuration scenario is set up.

   We will describe these two kind of approaches on the following part
   of this Section.  We will use the scenario depicted in Figure 10 to
   provide examples for the different techniques.

           Figure 10: Anticipant counter-measures - Base example

5.1.  Reactive counter-measures

   An operator who detects that its policies have been violated can
   contact the ASes that are likely to have performed the propagation
   tweaks so as to have them change their behavior.

   An operator can account the amount of traffic that has been subject
   to policy violation, and charge the peer that received the policy-
   violating traffic.  That is, the operator can claim that it has been
   a provider of that peer for the traffic that transited between the
   two ASes.

   An operator can decide to filter-out the concerned overlapping prefix
   at the peering session over which it was received.  In the example of
   Figure 10, AS2 would filter out the incoming prefix 10.0.0.0/24 from
   the eBGP session with AS5.  As a result, the traffic destined to that
   /24 would be forwarded by AS2 along its link with AS1, despite the
   actions performed by AS1 to have this traffic coming in through its
   link with AS3.

5.2.  Anticipant counter-measures

5.2.1.  Access lists

   An operator can configure its routers to dynamically install an
   access-list made of the prefixes towards which the forwarding of
   traffic from that interface would lead to a policy violation.  Note
   that this technique actually lets packets destined to a valid prefix
   be dropped while they are sent from a neighboring AS that cannot know
   about the policy violation and hence had no means to avoid the policy
   violation.

   In the example of Figure 10, AS2 would install an access-list denying
   packets matching 10.0.0.0/24 associated with the interface connecting
   to AS4.  As a result, traffic destined to that prefix would be
   dropped, despite the existence of a non policy-violating route
   towards 10.0.0.0/22.

5.2.2.  Automatic filtering

   As described in Section 3, filtering of overlapping prefixes can in
   some scenarios lead to policy violations.  Nevertheless, depending on
   the autonomous system implementing such practice, this operation can
   prevent these cases.  This can be illustrated using the example
   described in Figure 10: if AS2 or AS3 filter prefix 10.0.0.0/24,
   there would be no policy violation for AS2.

Internet-Draft        Making BGP filtering a habit         February 2013


5.2.3.  Neighbor-specific forwarding

   An operator can technically ensure that traffic destined to a given
   prefix will be forwarded from an entry point of the network based
   only on the set of paths that have been advertised over that entry
   point.

   As an example, let us analyze the scenario of Figure 10 from the
   point of view of AS2.  The edge router connecting to the AS4 forward
   packets destined to prefix 10.0.0.0/24 towards AS5.  Likewise, it
   will forward packets destined to prefix 10.0.0.0/22 towards AS1.  The
   router, however, only propagates the path to the covering prefix
   (10.0.0.0/22) to AS4.  An operator could implement the necessary
   techniques to force the edge router to forward packets coming from
   AS4 based only on the paths propagated to AS4.  Thus, the edge router
   would forward packets destined to 10.0.0.0/24 towards AS1 in which
   case no policy violation would occur.  This functionality could be
   implemented in different ways.  Check [2] for one particular example
   of it.


6.  Conclusions

   In this document we described threats to policies of autonomous
   systems caused by the filtering of overlapping prefixes by external
   networks.  We provide examples of scenarios of policy violations
   caused by these practices and introduce some techniques for their
   detection and counter.  We observe that there are reasonable
   situations in which ASes could filter overlapping prefixes, however,
   we encourage that network operators implement this type of filters
   only after considering such threats.
