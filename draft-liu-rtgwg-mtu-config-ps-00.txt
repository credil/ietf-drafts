1.  Introduction

   MTU for Jumbo frames is needed in practical network, This document
   describes a test on MTU configuration based on IS-IS and MPLS
   protocol with routers from different vendors.  By test of upgrading
   MTU from 1500 to 4470 in multi-vendor network, we bring up a problem
   statement of MTU configuration that measure ISIS negotiation.  With
   the discussion, necessary considerations and recommendation are also
   discussed.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   Throughout this document, the use of the terms "Provider Edge (PE)
   and Customer Edge (CE)" or "PE/CE" will be replaced by "PE" in all
   cases except when a network device is a CE when used in the carrier's
   carrier model.

3.  Requirements

   This section briefly describes enterprise customers and operational
   requirement on network MTU configuration along with a list of
   problems on MTU configuration over multi-vendor equipment.

   The MTU default configuration is 1500 in China Mobile backbone
   network.  However some enterprise customers requested that IP
   datagram's up to a length of 1600 bytes (including the IP header,

   aka. baby giant) must not be fragmented in the supplier's network
   (from CE to CE).  The receiving sequence of data packets at the
   destination location must match the sending sequence at the source
   location.  Besides, from the network operational point of view, TD-
   LTE network also has the MTU requirement.  As the CE connect to
   eNodeB with packet of 1500.  It will be jumbo frame in S1-U port(GTP
   header will be added).  To avoid fragment from CE to CE, it required
   MTU to support IP datagrams length of 1600 bytes at least.

   In above, we decided to upgrade MTU from 1500 to 4470(same as POS
   MTU) in the backbone routers.  In the rest of this draft, we are
   introduce a multi-vender test on MTU from 1500 to 4470 in IP networks
   and MPLS-VPN networks along with problem statement during this
   configuration.

4.  Problem statement

   This section list a number of problems we met during configure MTU
   from 1500 to 4470 in IP networks and MPLS-VPN networks with routers
   from different vendors.

4.1.  ISIS negotiations and configuration

   In IP networks, we tested routers from 4 vendors, indicated as A, B,
   C and D as the rest of the draft.  As all the four router being
   configure to 4470.  The ISIS protocol status is listed as table 1
   below.  ISIS negotiation appears 'Init' as MTU being configured to
   4470 across 4 routers from different vendors.

4.2.  MPLS MTU configuration

   In MPLS networks, we figure out that the MPLS diagrams should be
   calculate to MTU configuration.  However, as we configured and add 2
   MPLS labels (8 bytes) to MTU in this 4 router.  We captured fragments
   on some pairs among 4 routers.

5.  Test on MTU configuration

   This section introduction test on MTU configuration in IP networks
   and MPLS networks based on multi-vendor devices.

5.1.  Basic test description

   This test contain 3 test cases: Fist we configured MTU from 1500 to
   4470 in IP network to test ISIS status on 4 routers from different
   routers.  To reproduce this problem introduced on 3.1.  Then, based
   on the test result, we establish MPLS network to test how MPLS MTU
   cause that problem in 3.2.  Finally, we set up a network hybrid with
   IP and MPLS to test the performance of MTU configurations.  Test
   equipment are from 4 different vendors indicated as A, B, C and D in
   the following parts of discussion.

   TC1: Test of ISIS MTU.  The basic topology of ISIS MTU testing can be
   depicted as follows.

               Figure 1 Basic topology for ISIS MTU testing


   As figure 1 shows, two routers connect with each other by a 10GE
   link.  Each router connect to the tester by a 10GE link.  The tester
   generates unidirectional/bidirectional traffic between port 1 and
   port 2 with the traffic load of 10G. The frame length generate by
   tester is equals to the desired MTU parameter, 4470.  We configure

   MTU parameter on router 1 from 1500 to 4470 and check the ISIS
   protocol status and then configure the MTU parameter on router 2 from
   1500 to 4470 and check ISIS protocol status again to make sure the
   ISIS status is up.  If ISIS is not up, we increase MTU on one side
   until the ISIS status is up.  As ISIS is established, we inject the
   traffic from the tester and capture the packet on port 1 and port 2
   to check if there is a fragment on the packet.

   The routers from 4 vendors are being tested as the sequence table
   below.

   As figure 2 shows, there are 3 routers form 4 different vendors to
   build a MPLS network which Router1, Router3 take part as LER, Router
   2 as LSR.  VLAN are been established between PE and Tester.  The
   whole network connect by 10GE link as the figure shows.  The tester
   generates unidirectional/bidirectional traffic between port 1 and
   port 2 with the traffic load of 10G. While MTU parameter is set as
   the ISIS MTU test of each vendors.  And the tester generate traffic
   with the packet length of 4474(4474+4 bit VLAN tag).  We capture
   packet on tester's port1 and port2 to check if there is a fragment
   packet.  If there is, we increase one of the router's MTU parameter
   and capture again.

   The routers from 4 vendors are being tested as the sequence table
   below.

             Figure 3 Basic topology for MTU performance test


   As figure 3 shows, there are 5 routers to setup 4 vendor network with
   both MPLS and IP traffic.  Router1, Router4 and Router5 act as PE
   while Router2 takes part as RR and Router3 as P. The whole network is
   being connect by 10GE links.  The Tester connect with PE by two links
   while one is for VLAN traffic and other is for IP traffic.  PE
   connect with RR and P also using two links.  One is for MPLS traffic
   and other is for IP traffic.  All ports on tester generate traffic
   load of 10GE with random frame length (minimum 64, MAX is equal to
   MTU of PE).  The MTU parameter of routers on each port is set as the
   result in TC1 and TC2.

   This test case is to check the performance of latency and packet
   dropping rate with 24 hours.

5.2.  Test result and analysis

   This section introduce test report of MTU configuration workable in
   IP network and MPLS networks.

   A. Report of MTU configure in IP network based on multi-vendor
   routers.  In test case 1, ISIS MTU test.  We firstly set all
   configure MTU to 4470 and we get the ISIS establish status as this

   By analyze the IP diagram figure below.  We figure out the router of
   vendor A and vendor B is being configure based on L3 MTU which means
   the MTU parameter equals to L3 diagram length, 4470.  And Vendor C

   We find out the minimum MTU configuration parameter that allow ISIS
   to establish as the table below:

                  | Vendor |      MTU      |  Configure |

                  |    A   |      4470     |   L3 MTU   |
                  +--------+---------------+------------+
                  |    B   |      4470     |   L3 MTU   |

                    Table 5 ISIS status with equal MTU


   VLAN tag configuration in vendor A and vendor B is not counted in the
   MTU configuration.  However, in vendor C and vendor D, because of its
   L2 MTU, so we have to count every tag in the IP diagram.

   B. ISIS MTU negotiation test result between routers from different
   vendors.

   As test case 1, we modified the MTU from 1500 to 4470 on one side to
   another to test ISIS establish status as the table blow.  (With 1
   VLAN tag)

   By capture the packet from the ports on the tester and analysis of
   this result table, the negotiation method from vendor A and vendor B
   is strict to its MTU.  However the Vendor C and vendor D is check MTU
   with the other side.

   C. MTU influence on the MPLS with multi-vendor router.  In test case
   2, we test MTU configuration on multi-vendor routers in MPLS-VPN
   networks.  The MPLS diagram can be figure as figure 5


              |---------------------L2---------------------|
                                  |--------L3--------|

                           Figure 5 MPLS diagram


   The ? marker can be explained as the MPLS frame length depends on how
   many labels used in this network.  In our test models, the default
   MPLS labels is two(8 bits).  As we configure the MTU 4470L3 on Vendor
   A and B (4484 L2 on Vendor C and D) on all of the fours router.  We
   capture the packet from the tester's receiver ports and find

   fragment.  As we used two Vendor A's router with one Vendors B's
   router to build a MPLS network A-B-A and set the MTU parameter as
   4470.  There is no fragment.  As the MTU is L2 MTU on vendor C and
   vendor D. We add two MPLS labels in C's and D's MTU but is still have
   fragment.  As we increase C's and D's MTU.  We get the result as:


           +-----+------------+-------------------------------+
           |  A  |  4470+8    |       Add 2 MPLS labels       |

           |  B  |  4470+8    |       Add 2 MPLS labels       |
           +-----+------------+-------------------------------+
           |  C  |  4484+20   |    Default is 5 MPLS labels   |
           |     |            |        and cannot modify      |
           +-----+------------+-------------------------------+
           |  D  |  4484+12   |    Default is 3 MPLS labels   |
           |     |            |   and can modify manually     |

6.  Considerations and recommendations

   In this section, we summarize the analysis and come to the following
   considerations:

   a.Unified IP MTU negotiations should be taken into consideration.  As
   we know from the test.  The MTU configuration can be divided into two
   kinds, some vendor configure MTU based on L2 IP diagram, Vlan tag is
   not counted into MTU configuration.  However some vendor configure
   MTU by L3 diagram which means MTU configuration should count in all
   diagram length.  That will make confuse multi-vender in networking
   operation.

   b.Unified MPLS MTU configuration.  In MPLS-VPN network, MPLS label
   should be calculate in MTU configuration.  However, in multi-vendors
   networks, there is no standardization to make a unified MPLS MTU
   configuration.  Vendors such as A and B, It add MPLS labels manually
   as configured.  Vendor C add 5 fixed labels.  Vendor D add 3 fixed
   label.  If the MPLS label is not unified in MTU configuration, it
   will cause fragment in network operation.

   c.Unified default MTU negotiation.  Vendor A and Vendor B is compare
   MTU by a strict mode in MTU negotiation that MTU in both side should
   be equal to establish ISIS.  However Vendor C and Vendor D compare

   MTU by a loose mode in MTU negotiation that ISIS is established by
   Minimum MTU of one side.  Although it easier to for MTU negotiation,
   it's much easier to cause fragments for multi-vendor networking
   operations.

   With the consideration above, we summarize recommendations follows:

   We test MTU configuration in IP network and MPLS network with routers
   from different vendors.  The variety forms of MTU configuration
   trigger fragment easily in multi-vender networks.  However, in order
   to make network operation easier, we hope to bring out this problem
   statement for all vender to standardize the MTU configuration in IP
   network and MPLS network.  Meantime, we want to write an operation
   guideline to open the test result to declare the problem and guide
   others in MTU configurations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has assigned { mplsStdMIB 11 } to the MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB
   module specified in [RFC 4362].  This document only makes extensions
   to the MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB module, there is no further IANA
   requirement.

9.  Security Considerations

   No specific security issues with the proposed solutions are known.
   The proposed extension in this document does not introduce any new
   security considerations beyond that already apply to the base MPLS/
   BGP L3VPN specification as [RFC 3031] and [RFC 4364].
