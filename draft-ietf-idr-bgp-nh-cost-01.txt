1.  Motivation

   In certain situation route-reflector clients may not get optimum path
   to certain destinations.  ADDPATH solves this problem by letting
   route-reflector to advertise multiple paths for given prefix.  If
   number of advertised paths sufficiently big, route-reflector clients
   can choose same route as they would in case of full-mesh.  This
   approach however places additional burden on the control plane.
   Solutions proposed by [BGP-ORR] use different approach - instead of
   calculating best path from local speaker own perspective the
   calculations are done using cost from the client to the next-hops.
   Although they eliminate need for transmitting redundant routing
   information between peers, there are scenarios where cost to the
   next-hop cannot be obtained accurately using this methods.  For
   example, if next-hop information itself has been learned via BGP then
   simple SPF run on link-state database won't be sufficient to obtain
   cost information.  To address such scenarios this document proposes a
   solution where cost information to the next-hops is carried within
   BGP itself using dedicated SAFI.


2.  NEXT-HOP INFORMATION BASE

   To facilitate further description of the proposed solution we
   introduce new table for all known next hops and costs to it from
   various routers on the network.

   Next-Hop Information Base (NHIB) stores cost to reach next-hop from
   arbitrary router on the network.  This information is essential for
   choosing best path from a peer perspective rather than BGP-speaker
   own perspective.  In canonical form NHIB entry is triplet (router,
   next-hop, cost), however this specification does not impose any
   restriction on how BGP implementations store that information
   internally.  The cost in NHIB is does not have to be an IGP cost, but
   all costs in NHIB MUST be comparable with each other.

   NHIB can be populated from various sources both static and dynamic.
   This document focuses on populating NHIB using BGP.  However it is
   possible that protocols other than BGP could be also used to populate
   NHIB.


3.  BGP BEST PATH SELECTION MODIFICATION

   This section applies regardless of method used to populate NHIB.

   When BGP speaker conforming to this specification selects routes to
   be advertised to a peer it SHOULD use cost information from NHIB

   rather than its own IGP cost to the next-hop after step (d) of
   9.1.2.2 in [RFC4271].


4.  USING BGP TO POPULATE NHIB

   This section describes extension to base BGP specification that
   allows BGP to be used for exchanging next-hop information between BGP
   speakers via new SAFI in order to populate NHIB.  Although next-hops
   costs are exchanged via dedicated SAFI, this information is vital to
   best path selection process for other AFI/SAFI (e.g.  IPv4 and IPv6
   unicast).  It's therefore recommended that next-hop cost information
   is exchanged before other AFI/SAFI.

4.1.  NEXT-HOP SAFI

   This document introduces Next-Hop SAFI (NH SAFI) with value to be
   assigned by IANA and purpose of exchanging information about cost to
   next-hops.

4.2.  CAPABILITY ADVERTISEMENT

   A BGP speaker willing to exchange next-hop information MUST advertise
   this in the OPEN message using BGP Capability Code 1 (Multiprotocol
   Extensions, see [RFC4760]) setting AFI appropriately to indicate IPv4
   or IPv6 and SAFI to the value assigned by IANA for NH SAFI.  Note
   that if BGP speaker whishes to exchange cost information for both
   IPv4 and IPv6, then it MUST advertise two capabilities: one NH SAFI
   for IPv4 and one NH SAFI for IPv6.

4.3.  INFORMATION ENCODING

   Routers use standard BGP UPDATE messages to exchange NH SAFI
   information.  Cost to reachable next-hops is communicated using
   MP_REACH_NLRI (attribute 14) with NLRI part as described below.
   Requests are also sent using MP_REACH_NLRI.  Informing a neighbour
   about unreachable next-hop is done using MP_UNREACH_NLRI.  All NH
   SAFI messages MUST contain BGP COMMUNITY attribute with value
   NO_ADVERTISE (0xFFFFFF02) and their propagation MUST follow normal
   BGP rules (i.e. they're not to be propagated).

   To request cost to a next-hop from peer or to inform peer about cost
   to a next-hop BGP attribute 14 is used as follow:

   1.  AFI is set to indicate IPv4 or IPv6 (whichever is appropriate)

   2.  SAFI is set to NH SAFI

   3.  Network Address of Next-Hop field is zeroed out

   4.  NLRI field is encoded as shown in the next figure

   Format of NH SAFI NLRI is as follow:
    +-----+------+-------+----------+------+
    | AFI | SAFI | Flags | NEXT_HOP | cost |
    +-----+------+-------+----------+------+

   Flags - 1 octet field.  Least significant bit MUST be set to 1 for
   Request and to zero for Response

   AFI/SAFI fields can be set either to one of the registered values to
   indicate that next-hop cost info applies only to specified AFI/SAFI.
   Alternatively when both fields are be set to zero, the cost
   information applies to any compatible AFI/SAFI negotiated with given
   peer.

   Next-hop - IPv4 or IPv6 address for which cost is being communicated
   or requested.  Type is determined from context, and length is
   inferred from total length of attribute.

   Cost is 32-bit unsigned integer (value described below), and NEXT_HOP
   is AFI-specific address of the next-hop cost to which is being
   communicated or requested.  Size of NEXT_HOP field is inferred from
   total length of attribute 14.

   To inform peer that particular next-hop is unreachable
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute is used with same NLRI format as described
   above.  In this case cost field SHOULD be set to 0xFFFFFFFF.

4.4.  SESSION ESTABLISHMENT

   BGP speakers willing to exchange next-hop information SHOULD NOT
   establish more then one session for given AFI and NH SAFI, even using
   different transport addresses.  This can be ensured for example by
   checking peer's Router Id.

4.5.  INFORMATION EXCHANGE

   Typically NH SAFI sessions will be established between route-
   reflectors and its internal peers (both clients and non-clients).  As
   soon as the NH SAFI session is ESTABLISHED requests for next-hop cost
   and information information about next-hop costs MAY be sent
   independently.  That is, route-reflector MAY send multiple requests
   without waiting for response, and its peers MAY send cost information
   before or after receiving such request.  On the other hand, Router
   Reflectors SHOULD request cost information from their internal peers

   as soon as possible (due to reasons stated in section "BGP best path
   selection modification").  BGP speaker does not need to track
   outstanding requests to the peer.

   When a BGP speaker receives request for cost information it MUST
   reply with actual cost (not necessarily IGP cost, but whatever has
   been chosen to be carried in NH SAFI) to given next-hop or with cost
   set to all-ones indicating that next-hop is unreachable.  If next-hop
   information is obtained from sender's routing table, then sender MUST
   perform lookup exactly the same way as it would for resolving next-
   hop in BGP UPDATE message.  For example, for non-labelled
   destinations (e.g.  AFI/SAFI 1/1 or 2/1) lookup would be done using
   longest match, whereas for labelled IPv4 (AFI/SAFI 1/4, 1/128 or 2/4)
   exact-match would be used.

   When a BGP speaker detects change in cost to previously advertised
   next-hop with delta equal or exceeding configured advertisement
   threshold, it SHOULD inform peer by sending MP_UNREACH_NLRI as
   described earlier.

   When a BGP speaker discovers new next-hop among candidate routes it
   SHOULD request cost information from the peer.

4.6.  TERMINATION OF NH SAFI SESSION

   When BGP speaker terminates (for whatever reason) NH SAFI session
   with a peer, it SHOULD remove all cost information received from that
   peer unless instructed by configuration to do otherwise.

4.7.  GRACEFUL RESTART AND ROUTE REFRESH

   NH SAFI sessions could use graceful restart and route refresh
   mechanisms in the same way as it's used for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast -
   preservation and purge of next-hop cost information follows normal GR
   rules.


5.  Security considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate value for Next-Hop Subsequent Address
   Family Identifier.

A.1.  Trivial case

        --+---NetA---+--
          |          |
         r1          r2
          |          |
          R1--RR-----R2
          | \        |
          |  +------R4
          R3

   In this scenario r1 and r3 along with NetA are part of AS1; and R1-R4
   along with RR are in AS2.

   If RR implements non-optimized route-reflection, then it will choose
   path to NetA via R1 and advertise it to both R3 and R4.  Such choice
   is good from R3 perspective, but it results in suboptimal traffic

   flow from R4 to NetA.

   Using NH SAFI the route-reflector will learn that cost from R4 to R1
   is 8 whereas to R2 it's only 1.  RR will announce NetA to R4 with
   next-hop set to R2, while its announce to R3 will still have R1 as
   next-hop.  Both R3 and R4 now will send traffic to NetA via closest
   exit, achieving same behaviour as if full iBGP mesh would have been
   configured.

A.2.  Non-IGP based cost

   When it's desirable to direct traffic over an exit other than the one
   with smallest IGP cost, NH SAFI can be used to convey cost which is
   not based on IGP.  For example, network operator may arrange exit
   points in order of administrative preference and configure routers to
   send this instead of IGP cost.  Route reflector then will then
   calculate best path based on administrative preference rather than
   IGP metrics.

   Network operators should excercise care to ensure that all routers up
   to and including exit point do not devert packets on to a different
   path, otherwise routing loops may occur.  One way to achieve this is
   to have consistent administrative preference among all routers.
   Another option is to use a tunneling mechanism (e.g.  MPLS-TE tunnel)
   between source and the exit point, provided that the router serving
   as exit point will send packets out of the network rather than
   diverting them to another exit point.

A.3.  Multiple route-reflectors

   This example demonstrates that NH SAFI peerings are necessary only
   between routers that already exchange other AFI/SAFI.

                              |
   R1----R3---------R5----R7--+
         |           |        |
        RR1          |       NetA
         |          RR2       |
         |           |        |
   R2----R4---------R6----R8--+
                              |

   In the above network the routers R1-R4 are clients of RR1, and R5-R8
   are clients of RR2.  RR1 and RR2 also peer with each other and use
   ADDPATH.

   RR2 learns about NetA from R7 and R8.  Since it sends not just best-
   path but all prefixes to RR1, there is no need for RR2 to learn cost

   information from R1 and R2 towards R7 and R8.  On the other hand RR1
   does exchange NH SAFI information with R1 and R2 so that each of them
   can receive routes, which are best from their perspective.

   As addition to ADDPATH a mechanism could be devised that would allow
   RR2 to learn how many alternative routes does it need to send to RR1.
   For example, if NetA would also be connected to R9 (not shown) but
   all clients of RR1 prefer R7 as exit point and R9 as next-best, then
   there is no need for RR2 to send NetA routes with next-hop R8 to RR1.

   Discussion: authors would like to solicit discussion whether there is
   sufficient interest in such mechanism.

A.4.  Inter-AS MPLS VPN

   Previous example could be transposed to Inter-AS MPLS VPN Option C
   scenario.  In this case route reflectors RR1 and RR2 can be from
   different autonomous system.  Essentially the behaviour of routers
   remains as already described.

A.5.  Corner case

      --+---NetA--+--
        |         |
   RR---R1        R2
          \      /
           R3---R4

   In the above network cost from R3 to R1 is 10, all other costs are 1.
   If RR advertises NetA to R3 based on cost information received from
   R3, but uses its own cost when advertising NetA to R4, there will be
   a loop formed.  This is the reason why section "BGP best path
   selection modification" requires RR to have next-hop cost information
   for every next-hop and every peer.

   Note that the problem is the same as if RR would not use extensions
   described in this document and R3 would peer directly with R1 and R2,
   while R4 would peer only with RR.
