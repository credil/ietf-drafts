           Distributing Address Selection Policy using DHCPv6
                 draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-opt-11.txt

Abstract

   RFC 6724 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that
   allow nodes to select an appropriate address when faced with multiple
   source and/or destination addresses to choose between.  RFC 6724
   allows for the future definition of methods to administratively
   configure the address selection policy information.  This document
   defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site
   administrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the
   default address selection parameters and policy table, and thus to
   control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6724] describes default algorithms for selecting an address when
   a node has multiple destination and/or source addresses to choose
   from by using an address selection policy.  In Section 2 of RFC 6724,
   it is suggested that the default policy table may be administratively
   configured to suit the specific needs of a site.  This specification
   defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration.

   Some problems were identified with the default address selection
   policy as originally defined in [RFC3484].  As a result, RFC 3484 was
   updated and obsoleted by [RFC6724].  While this update corrected a
   number of issues identifed from operational experience, it is
   unlikely that any default policy will suit all scenarios, and thus
   mechanisms to control the source address selection policy will be
   necessary.  Requirements for those mechanisms are described in
   [RFC5221], while solutions are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-considerations].  Those documents have
   helped shape the improvements in the default address selection
   algorithm in [RFC6724] as well as the requirements for the DHCPv6
   option defined in this specification.

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC2460] and the
   DHCPv6 specification defined in [RFC3315]

2.  Address Selection options

   The Address Selection option provides the address selection policy
   table, and some other configuration parameters.

   An Address Selection option contains zero or more policy table
   options.  Multiple policy table options in an Address Selection
   option constitute a single policy table.  When an Address Selection
   option does not contain a policy table option, it may be used to just
   convey the A and P flags.

   The format of the Address Selection option is given below.

       0                   1                   2                   3

   option-len:  The total length of the Reserved field, A, P flags, and
        POLICY TABLE OPTIONS in octets.


   Reserved:  Reserved field.  The server MUST set this value to zero
        and the client MUST ignore its content.


   A:   Automatic Row Addition flag.  This flag toggles the Automatic
        Row Addition flag at client hosts, which is described in section
        2.1 of [RFC6724].  If this flag is set to 1, it does not change
        client host behavior, that is, a client MAY automatically add

        additional site-specific rows to the policy table.  If set to 0,
        the Automatic Row Addition flag is disabled, and a client SHOULD
        NOT automatically add rows to the policy table.  If the option
        contains a POLICY TABLE option, this flag is meaningless, and
        automatic row addition SHOULD NOT be performed against the
        distributed policy table.


   P:   Privacy Preference flag.  This flag toggles the Privacy
        Preference flag on client hosts, which is described in section 5
        of [RFC6724].  If this flag is set to 1, it does not change
        client host behavior, that is, a client will prefer temporary
        addresses [RFC4941].  If set to 0, the Privacy Preference flag
        is disabled, and a client will prefer public addresses.


   POLICY TABLE OPTIONS:  Zero or more Address Selection Policy Table
        options, as described below.  This option corresponds to a row
        in the policy table defined in section 2.1 of [RFC6724].

   label:  An 8-bit unsigned integer; this value is for correlation of
        source address prefixes and destination address prefixes.  This
        field is used to deliver a label value in the [RFC6724] policy
        table.

   precedence:  An 8-bit unsigned integer; this value is used for
        sorting destination addresses.  This field is used to to deliver
        a precedence value in [RFC6724] policy table.


   prefix-len:  An 8-bit unsigned integer; the number of leading bits in
        the prefix that are valid.  The value ranges from 0 to 128.


   prefix:  A variable-length field containing an IP address or the
        prefix of an IP address.  An IPv4-mapped address [RFC4291] must
        be used to represent an IPv4 address as a prefix value.  This
        field is padded with zeros up to the nearest octet boundary when
        prefix-len is not divisible by 8.  This can be expressed using
        the following equation: (prefix-len + 7)/8 So the length of this
        field should be between 0 and 16 bytes.  For example, the prefix
        2001:db8::/60 would be encoded with an prefix-len of 60, the
        prefix would be 8 octets and would contains octets 20 01 0d b8
        00 00 00 00.


3.  Processing the Address Selection option

   This section describes how to process a received Address Selection
   option at the DHCPv6 client.

   This option's concept is to serve as a hint for a node about how to
   behave in the network.  Ultimately, while the node's administrator
   can control how to deal with the received policy information, the
   implementation SHOULD follow the method described below uniformly, to
   ease troubleshooting and to reduce operational costs.

3.1.  Handling local configurations

   [RFC6724] defines two flags (A, P) and the default policy table.
   Also, users are usually able to configure the flags and the policy
   table to satisfy their own requirements.

   The client implementation SHOULD provide the following choices to the
   user.

   (a)  replace the existing flags and active policy table with the
      DHCPv6 distributed flags and policy table.

   (b)  preserve the existing flags and active policy table, whether
      this be the default policy table, or user configured policy.

Internet-Draft     DHCPv6 Address Selection Policy Opt       August 2013


   Choice (a) SHOULD be the default, i.e. that the policy table is not
   explictly configured by the user.

3.2.  Handling stale policy tables

   When the information from the DHCP server goes stale, the policy
   received from the DHCP server SHOULD be deprecated.

   The received information can be considered stale in several cases,
   e.g., when the interface goes down, the DHCP server does not respond
   for a certain amount of time, and the Information Refresh Time is
   expired.

3.3.  Handling multiple interfaces

   The policy table, and other parameters specified in this document,
   are node-global information by their nature.  One reason being that
   the outbound interface is usually chosen after destination address
   selection.  So a host cannot make use of multiple address selection
   policies even if they are stored per interface.

   The policy table is defined as a whole, so the slightest addition/
   deletion from the policy table brings a change in the semantics of
   the policy.

   It also should be noted that the absence of a DHCP-distributed policy
   from a certain network interface should not infer that the network
   administrator does not care about address selection policy at all,
   because it may mean there is a preference to use the default address
   selection policy.  So, it should be safe to assume that the default
   address selection policy should be used where no overriding policy is
   provided.

   Under the above assumptions, we can specify how to handle received
   policy as follows.

   In the absence of distributed policy for a certain network interface,
   the default address selection policy SHOULD be used.  A node should
   use Address Selection options by default in any of the following two
   cases:

   1: A single-homed host SHOULD use default address selection options,
      where the host belongs exclusively to one administrative network
      domain, usually through one active network interface.

   2: Hosts that use advanced heuristics to deal with multiple received
      policies that are defined outside the scope of this document
      SHOULD use Address Selection options.

Internet-Draft     DHCPv6 Address Selection Policy Opt       August 2013


   Implementations MAY provide configuration options to enable this
   protocol on a per interface basis.

   Implementations MAY store distributed address selection policies per
   interface.  They can be used effectively on implementations that
   adopt per-application interface selection.

4.  Implementation Considerations

   o  The value 'label' is passed as an unsigned integer, but there is
      no special meaning for the value, that is whether it is a large or
      small number.  It is used to select a preferred source address
      prefix corresponding to a destination address prefix by matching
      the same label value within the DHCP message.  DHCPv6 clients
      SHOULD convert this label to a representation appropriate for the
      local implementation (e.g., string).


   o  The maximum number of address selection rules that may be conveyed
      in one DHCPv6 message depends on the prefix length of each rule
      and the maximum DHCPv6 message size defined in [RFC3315].  It is
      possible to carry over 3,000 rules in one DHCPv6 message (maximum
      UDP message size).  However, it should not be expected that DHCP
      clients, servers and relay agents can handle UDP fragmentation.
      Network adiministrators SHOULD consider local limitations to the
      maximum DHCPv6 message size that can be reliably transported via
      their specific local infrastructure to end nodes; and therefore
      they SHOULD consider the number of options, the total size of the
      options, and the resulting DHCPv6 message size, when defining
      their policy table.


5.  Security Considerations

   A rogue DHCPv6 server could issue bogus address selection policies to
   a client.  This might lead to incorrect address selection by the
   client, and the affected packets might be blocked at an outgoing ISP
   because of ingress filtering, incur additional network charges, or be
   misdirected to an attacker's machine.  Alternatively, an IPv6
   transition mechanism might be preferred over native IPv6, even if it
   is available.  To guard against such attacks, a legitimate DHCPv6
   server should communicate through a secure, trusted channel, such as
   a channel protected by IPsec, SEND and DHCP authentication, as
   described in section 21 of [RFC3315].  A commonly used alternative
   mitigation is to employ DHCP snooping at Layer 2.

   Another threat surrounds the potential privacy concern as described
   in the security considerations section of [RFC6724], whereby an

Internet-Draft     DHCPv6 Address Selection Policy Opt       August 2013


   attacker can send packets with different source addresses to a
   destination to solicit different source addresses in the responses
   from that destination.  This issue will not be modified by the
   introduction of this option, regardless of whether the host is
   multihomed or not.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign option codes to OPTION_ADDRSEL and
   OPTION_ADDRSEL_TABLE from the "DHCP Option Codes" registry (http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xml).

Appendix B.  Examples

   [RFC5220] gives several cases where address selection problems
   happen.  This section contains some examples for solving those cases
   by using the DHCP option defined in this text to update the hosts'
   policy table in a network accordingly.  There is also some discussion
   of example policy tables in sections 10.3 to 10.7 of RFC 6724.

B.1.  Ingress Filtering Problem

   In the case described in section 2.1.2 of [RFC5220], the following
   policy table should be distributed, when Router performs static
   routing and directs the default route to ISP1 as per Figure 2.  By
   putting the same label value to all IPv6 addresses (::/0) and the
   local subnet (2001:db8:1000:1::/64), a host picks a source address in
   this subnet to send a packet via the default route.

      Prefix        Precedence Label
      ::1/128               50     0
      ::/0                  40     1
      2001:db8:1000:1::/64  45     1

B.2.  Half-Closed Network Problem

   In the case described in section 2.1.3 of [RFC5220], the following
   policy table should be distributed.  By splitting the closed network
   prefix (2001:db8:8000::/36) from all IPv6 addresses (::/0) and giving
   different labels, the closed network prefix will only be used when
   packets are destined for the closed network.

      Prefix        Precedence Label
      ::1/128               50     0
      ::/0                  40     1
      2001:db8:8000::/36    45    14
      ::ffff:0:0/96         35     4
      2002::/16             30     2
      2001::/32              5     5
      fc00::/7               3    13

B.3.  IPv4 or IPv6 Prioritization

   In the case described in section 2.2.1 of [RFC5220], the following
   policy table should be distributed to prioritize IPv6.  This case is
   also described in [RFC6724]

      Prefix        Precedence Label
      ::1/128               50     0
      ::/0                  40     1
      ::ffff:0:0/96        100     4
      2002::/16             30     2
      2001::/32              5     5
      fc00::/7               3    13
      ::/96                  1     3
      fec0::/10              1    11
      3ffe::/16              1    12


B.4.  ULA or Global Prioritization

   In the case described in section 2.2.3 of [RFC5220], the following
   policy table should be distributed, or Automatic Row Addition flag
   should be set to 1.  By splitting the ULA in this site
   (fc12:3456:789a::/48) from all IPv6 addresses (::/0) and giving it
   higher precendence, the ULA will be used to connect to servers in the
   same site.
