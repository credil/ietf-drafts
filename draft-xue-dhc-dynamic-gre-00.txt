Abstract

   Specifically, WiFi has emerged as an important access technology for
   Multiple Service Operator (MSO) and mobile service provider.  For
   mobile service provider, WiFi is preferred as a trusted access
   technology for service.  It has became important to provide simple
   transition method expected for service via WiFi access.  For example,
   tunnelling on the customer side aims at conveying WiFi service
   between a hotspot and the Service Gateway.  GRE tunnel is an
   increasingly popular encapsulation choice because of simple
   encapsulation and easy implementation, especially in aforementioned
   environments.  However, manual configuration is not suitable if there
   are large numbers of the end-points of GRE tunnels.  This document
   proposes a dynamic-configured stateless GRE tunnel, which does not
   modify encapsulation format of GRE, but adds signaling for tunnel
   parameters discovery, such as address, GRE key etc.

1.  Introduction

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel[RFC1701][RFC2784] is
   widely deployed in the ISP networks.  There are several general
   scenarios that many access devices set up GRE tunnels to a
   concentrator network equipment for public or private services.  In
   this document, the tunnel endpoint may be Customer Premises Equipment
   (CPE), i.e., a home gateway or an access point, and a network
   concentrator equipment, i.e., a Service Gateway which is kind of
   Network Facing PE (NPE).

   Specifically, WiFi has emerged as an important access technology for
   Multiple Service Operator (MSO) and mobile service provider.  For
   mobile service provider, WiFi is preferred as a trusted access
   technology for private service.  It has became important to provide
   simple transition method expected for service via WiFi access.  For

   example, tunnelling on the customer side aims at conveying WiFi
   service.  A tunnel is thus defined in this scenario as the connection
   between the end-point at the cable modem or hotspot, and the other
   end-point at the Service Gateway.

   Currently, several tunnel mechanisms have been standardized, for
   example Layer Two Tunneling Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3) [RFC3931].
   L2TPv3 supports IP/UDP encapsulation and fulfills the tunnel
   requirements.  However, as a multi-layers encapsulation protocol,
   L2TPv3 has to carry multiple protocol headers per data packet.  It is
   complicated and costly, mostly used for Virtual Private Network
   (VPN).  Most Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), such as cable modem
   or hotspot is too simple to be a L2TPv3 initiator.  In most
   scenarios, providers do not need such a complicated transition
   method.  GRE tunnel is an increasingly popular encapsulation choice
   because of simple encapsulation and easy implementation, especially
   in aforementioned environments.

   An illustration about GRE tunnel deployment in MSO network is shown
   in the following figure.

   However, up to now, GRE tunnels are stateless and configured
   manually.  Manual configuration is not suitable if there are large
   numbers of CPEs, i.e., Cable Modems (CMs) or hotspots, which are the
   end-points of GRE tunnels.  This document proposes a dynamic-
   configured stateless GRE tunnel, which does not modify encapsulation
   format of GRE, but adds signaling for tunnel parameters discovery,
   such as address, GRE key, etc[RFC2890].

   In addition, this document extends Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) for IPv4 [RFC2131]or DHCP for IPv6 [RFC3315], so that
   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) can automatically acquire the
   Network Premises Equipment (NPE) address.  Then the stateless GRE
   will be setup dynamically.  Additionally, the discovery process may
   also support load-sharing and recovery from a single point of
   failure.

Internet-Draft            Dynamic Stateless GRE                July 2013


   In the absence of DHCP, PPP, Router Advertisements or CAPWAP could be
   used for GRE tunnel discovery automatically, but this document does
   not discuss these methods in detail.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document.

   User Equipment (UE)

   The UE is the a device of the subscriber, which could be PC or Mobile
   Phone.

   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)

   The CPE equipment is the box that a provider places with the
   customer, which could be Home Gateway (HG), Cable Modem (CM), etc.
   When CPE is using DHCP to obtain network address, CPE is acting as
   "DHCP Client"

   User Facing Equipment (UPE)

   The UPE is the device to which the functions needs to take forwarding
   or switching decisions at the ingress of the provider network, which
   could be Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS).  UPE is the "DHCP
   Server" or "DHCP relay agent", when CPE is using DHCP to obtain
   network address.

   Network Facing Equipment (NPE)

   The NPE is the device to which the signalling and control functions
   are allocated.  It is kind of Service Gateway.

3.  Dynamic Stateless GRE Tunnel

   Stateless Dynamic GRE tunnel mechanism enables the tunnel endpoints
   can discovery each other dynamically at first.  Based on this
   preliminary discovery phase, GRE tunnel will be setup accordingly.

   The process is described in the following sub-sections.

3.1.  Preliminary Phase

Internet-Draft            Dynamic Stateless GRE                July 2013


3.1.1.  NPE discovery on CPE

   Before tunneling to NPE,CPE MUST get the NPE address and other tunnel
   parameters such as GRE Key, Version, Protocol Type[RFC2784][RFC2890]
   if required.  The information may be configured on the CPE.

   However, manual configurations are difficult to operate when there
   are large number of CPEs.  A new mechanism is required to enable the
   access point in the access network to discover the information of the
   concentrator automatically.  It is proposed to extend DHCPv4 or
   DHCPv6 for discovery.

   In order to support NPE discovery on CPE, new DHCP GRE Discovery (GD)
   Options are defined respectively for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.  They have
   the identical structure apart from address length.  The form is
   defined in Section 4.

   When a DHCP server answers a CPE request message, the NPE information
   can be carried in a DHCP reply message via DHCP options.  Thus CPE
   configures the NPE address and tunnel parameter of GRE tunnel, such
   as GRE key etc if they are carried in the DHCP message.  Details are
   descried in Section 3.

   DHCP server decides to attach GD option based on policy.  One choice
   is to respond only if the client requests the GD option; another is
   to append it to every reply no matter the client requests it or not.

   For load sharing or single-point failure recovery purposes, a DHCP
   reply message may carry information of more than one NPEs.

3.1.2.  CPE discovery on NPE

   Normally, GRE encapsulated packet should be received by NPE.  In this
   case,NPE should recognize that this is a GRE packet.  Then the
   parameters of tunnel, such as IP address of CPE as source address may
   be checked and restored as destination of GRE tunnel on NPE,
   additionally, GRE Key, GRE Version, Protocol Type.

   The GRE encapsulated packet used could be data packet or control
   packet.  Generally, CPE can encapsulate UE's first packet with GRE.
   For example, during a User Equipment (UE) subscriber attached
   initiates the DHCP procedure for an inner address, CPE should
   encapsulated this DHCP message from UE via GRE.  The destination IP
   of outer layer header in GRE encapsulation can be obtained as
   description of section 2.1.1.  The outer source IP uses the IP
   address of the CPE.

Internet-Draft            Dynamic Stateless GRE                July 2013


   Consequently, NPE can discover CPE via the received GRE encapsulated
   packet from CPE.

3.2.  Establishment Phase

   As the description in aforementioned section, in order to set up the
   dynamic tunnel, tunnel endpoints are required to discover each other.
   After the Preliminary Phase, GRE tunnel can be setup subsequently.

   When NPE receives the packet with GRE encapsulation, it should look
   up the outer source IP of the packet in its tunnel client list.  If
   it is a new client, the NPE adds source IP into the tunnel client
   list, decapsulates GRE header and deals with the packet encapsulated
   by GRE.  For example, if NPE recognizes the packet is the DHCP
   message from UE for address request after decapsulating GRE header.
   Then the NPE can records the assigned UE's address, which is the
   inner address of GRE encapsulated packet.

   The tunnel client list records the information of all tunnel clients.
   Each entry of the list describes information of a tunnel, includes
   the mapping of the inner address of tunnel and the outer IP of
   client.  Based on transmission method over GRE, the inner address is
   UE's IP address when IP over GRE, or MAC address when Eth over GRE.
   For inbound traffic, NPE checks the tunnel client list according to
   destination address of the packet and decides which tunnel the
   traffic should be forwarded to.

3.3.  Keepalive Phase

   There could be a keepalive mechanism for GRE tunnel between CPE and
   NPE.  If there is neither keepalive packet nor data packet when the
   deployed timer expires, the NPE will tear down the tunnel and
   releases resource.

4.  DHCP Option Definition

   The DHCPv4 GRE Discovery (GD) Option is mainly used when CPE wants to
   obtain an NPE address in IPv4 network.  This Option is carried in
   DHCPv4.

   The DHCPv4 GD Option is structured as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   At Preliminary Phase, the CM, as one endpoint of GRE tunnel, may get
   information of SG by the DHCP method mentioned in section 2.1.1.

   Subsequently, the CM encapsulates the UE's packet with GRE
   encapsulation to SG's address y.y.y.y. The source IP of GRE header is
   x.x.x.x. Once receiving the packet, the SG looks up the outer source
   IP x.x.x.x of the packet in its tunnel client list.  If it is a new
   client, SG will creat and configure a new GRE tunnel.  Generally, the
   encapsulated packet could be DHCP packet from UE for address.  For
   example, if NPE recognizes the packet is the DHCP message from UE for
   address request after decapsulating GRE header.  Then the NPE can
   records the assigned UE's address, which is the inner address of GRE
   encapsulated packet.  In addition, a mapping between the inner
   address of UE and the outer IP address of GRE is added into the
   tunnel client list on SG.  Finally the application IPv4 traffic can
   pass through the GRE tunnel, and the establishment phase finished.

   During Keepalive Phase, there could be a keepalive mechanism for GRE
   tunnel between CPE and NPE.  If there is neither keepalive packet nor
   data packet when the deployed timer expires, the NPE will tear down
   the tunnel and releases resource.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate one DHCPv4 GD Option code TBD1 and one
   DHCPv6 GD Option code TBD2.

7.  Security Considerations

   [RFC2890] describes the security requirement of GRE tunnel.  This
   document follows the requirements based on sub-options used when
   necessary, mentioned in Section 3.
