Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to address the current problem 
   inherent with using Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) 
   [RFC3972] and introduces a new algorithm that can eliminate the cost 
   of CGA algorithm. This algorithm also responds to the security issues 
   (IP spoofing) exists in Privacy Extension [RFC4941] or any other 
   documents that does not focus on local security by integrating 
   privacy with the security.

1.  Introduction 

   IPv6 addresses consist of two parts; the subnet prefix, which is the 
   64 leftmost bits of the IPv6 address, and the Interface ID (IID), 
   which is the 64 rightmost bits of the IPv6 address. The IEEE 
   Standards Association [1] (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291) [RFC4291] offered 
   a standard for the generation of IPv6 Interface IDs (IID) called the 
   Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64). EUI-64s are generated by the 
   concatenation of an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), 
   assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority (IEEE RA), with the 
   Extension Identifier assigned by the hardware manufacturer. If the 
   OUI is 24 bits and the extension identifier is also 24 bits (this 
   constitutes the MAC address), then to form the 64-bit EUI address, 
   the OUI portion of the MAC address is inserted into the leftmost 24 
   bits of the EUI-64 8 byte field and the Extension Identifier is 
   inserted into the rightmost 24 bits of the EUI-64 8 byte field. A 
   value of 0xFFFE is then inserted between these two 24-bit items. IEEE 
   has chosen 0xFFFE as a reserved value which can only appear in an 
   EUI-64 which is generated from an EUI-48 MAC address. If OUI is 36 
   bits, then OUI is concatinated with the Extension Identifier in order 
   to generate EUI-64. For example, if a manufacturer's OUI-36 
   hexadecimal value is 00-5A-D1-02-3, and the manufacture hexadecimal 
   value, for the Extension Identifier for a given component is 
   4-42-61-71, then the EUI-64 value generated from these two numbers 
   will be 00-5A-D1-02-34-42-61-71. Bit 7 (u bit) in the OUI portion of 
   the address is used to indicate either global or local uniqueness. 
   Globally unique addresses assigned by the IEEE set this bit to zero, 
   by default,indicating global uniqueness.The bit is set to 1 for 
   locally created addresses, such as those used for virtual interfaces 
   or a MAC address manually configured by an administrator. 

   There are currently some mechanisms used to generate a randomized IID 
   that do not make use of a MAC address; CGA [RFC3972], Privacy 
   Extension (generation of temporary addresses) [RFC4941], etc. In this 
   document we discuss the problem inherent with using the current 
   mechanisms and then we explain our solution to the problem, which is 
   to randomize the IID observing privacy, while, at the same time, 
   providing security to Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) messages of 
   nodes in the IP layer. DHCPv6 [RFC3315] can also benefit from this 
   approach for the generation of a random IID or for authentication 
   purposes.

3.  Problem Statement 

   The drawback to using IIDs that do not change over time is one of 
   privacy. The node will generate the same IID whenever it joins a new 
   network thus making it easy for an attacker to track that node when 
   it moves to different networks. 

   The main problem with the privacy extension mechanism, when using the 
   first approach as explained in section 3.2.1 RFC-4941 [RFC4941], 
   i.e., using stable storage, is the lack of a provision for the use of 
   a security mechanism and also the need to generate public addresses 
   based on MAC addresses. The Privacy Extension RFC partially prevents 
   attacks related to privacy issues, but it cannot prevent attacks 
   related to security issues. For example, it cannot prevent IP 
   spoofing attacks and it cannot provide proof of IP address ownership 
   for a node. If one wants to use a secure method, with the privacy 
   extension, then one needs to use CGA. The problem with using CGA is 
   in the computational overhead necessary to compute it when higher sec 
   values are used and the time that is needed to perform the 
   verification process. This time is based on the reverse of the steps 
   required for the CGA regeneration during the verification process 
   along with the additional time needed for signature verification. 

   The first problem with CGA is the apparent lack of a defense against 
   Denial of Service (DoS) types of attack that are performed against 
   verifier nodes. In the CGA RFC there is no explanation as to how to 
   prevent these types of attacks. This means that an attacker can 
   overwhelm the verifier node with false CGA values thus rendering it 
   unable to process further messages.This document also proposes a 
   solution to this type of attack. The other problem with CGA sec value 
   higher than 0 is unnecessary making busy the CPU and other resources 
   in a node for unlimited period of time. It is because there is no 
   guarantee that the 16 by sec value equal to zero condition will ever 
   be met. For CGA sec value 0, the attacker needs to do 2^59 brute 
   force attacks. So the use of the CGA algorithm, which is compute 
   intensive, is thus not ideal for use with nodes having limited 
   resources or with nodes wanting to change their IID frequently for 
   the purpose of protecting their privacy. 

   In order to overcome the problem with using the other mechanisms, the 
   time needed for IP address generation and verification needs to be 
   reduced and avoid unnecessary usage of CPU while at the same not 
   scarifying user's security. We propose the use of the SSAS algorithm, 
   along with the SSAS signature, to provide a node with the protection 
   it needs to protect it against IP spoofing and other spoofing types

   of attack in the IP layer. Our experimental results [2] show that 
   SSAS is more secure and faster than CGA when using a sec value of 0 
   (Brute force attacks against 64 bits (when using first SSAS 
   algorithm) while in CGA this value is 59 bits) and much faster than 
   CGA when using a sec value of 1. Also the attacker has a few seconds 
   to attack 64 bits in SSAS. This is because the neighboring nodes keep 
   the public key of this node in their cache after the first successful 
   verification. They keep this value as long as the reachability check 
   is valid (the node response to the Neighbor Solicitation messages). 



3.1.  SSAS Applications 



3.1.1.  Preventing Attacks 

   The following sections detail some types of attack that SSAS along 
   with SSAS signature can prevent. It provides the node with the 
   protection against the same attacks as does the CGA including RSA 
   signature option of SeND. A complete list of attacks can be find in 
   [RFC3756] 



3.1.1.1.  Replay attack 

   In this type of attack, an attacker will sniff the Neighbor Discovery 
   Protocol enabled network (NDP) messages to find, and then copy, a 
   legitimate signature and public key to his own NDP message which he 
   will then send to the original sender. But with the use of the SSAS 
   algorithm (Including the timestamp in the signature) and using RPKI, 
   this can be prevented. The use of a timestamp works because the 
   timestamp will be valid for only a short period of time. (this 
   accounts for clock skews.) 



3.1.1.2.  IP spoofing 

   This is a well-known type of attack in NDP. This type of attack is 
   used against the Duplicate Address Detection process. In this attack, 
   when a node joins the network and generates a new IP address, the 
   node sends a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message to check for address 
   collisions in the network. The attacker, in this scenario, spoofs the 
   IP address and responds back to the node with a Neighbor 
   Advertisement (NA) message claiming ownership of this IP address. 
   While the SSAS algorithm does allow this node to verify other nodes 
   in the network, an attacker will not have the private key associated 
   with this node which is needed for SSAS signature generation, so the 
   verification process will fail.

INTERNET DRAFT       SSAS for Autoconfiguration         November 4, 2013



3.1.1.3.  Denial of Service (DoS) attacks 

   An attacker might send many NDP messages, using invalid signatures, 
   to a victim?s node which then forces the node to busy itself with the 
   verification process. To mitigate this attack, a node SHOULD set a 
   limit on the number of messages (x) that should be verified within a 
   certain period of time. Implementations MUST provide a conservative 
   default and SHOULD provide a means for detecting when this limit is 
   reached. 



3.1.1.4.  Spoofed Redirect Message 

   Redirect messages, imitating the end host needing redirection, can be 
   sent from any router on the same broadcast segment. The attacker uses 
   the link-local address of the current first-hop router in order to 
   send a Redirect message to a legitimate node. Since that node 
   identifies the message as coming from its first hop router, by use of 
   the link-local address, it accepts the Redirect. The Redirect will 
   remain in effect as long as the attacker responds to the Neighbor 
   Unreachability Detection probes sent to the link-layer address. To 
   preclude this from occurring, the address ownership of the first-hop 
   router should be verified. The use of the SSAS verification process 
   along with RPKI will prevent such an attack. 



3.1.2.  Nodes with limited resources 

   SSAS can be used in nodes where limited computational resources are 
   available. It can provide protection to these nodes against the types 
   of attack stated above. Sensor networks are a prime example of nodes 
   with limited resources (such as battery, CPU, and etc); see RFC-4919 
   [RFC4919] for use in IPv6 networks. Because currently, as explained 
   in section 4. RFC-6775, the generation of the IID is based on EUI-64 
   which makes these nodes vulnerable to privacy and security attacks. 
   One of these types of attack can occur during the Duplicate Address 
   Detection (DAD) process. 

   Another example for the use of SSAS would be in mobile networks 
   during the generation of IP addresses, as explained in section 4.4 
   RFC-6275 [RFC6275]. The current problem with the addressing mechanism 
   in a mobile node is that no privacy is observed when a node moves to 
   another network while usually keeping its Home Address. If there were 
   a fast and secure mechanism available, then it would be possible to 
   set this Home Address and change it and re-register it to the Home 
   network. Another possible use for SSAS in mobile nodes could be as a 
   security mechanism during the configuration of Care of Address (CoA); 
   see section 3. RFC-5213 [RFC5213]. In that RFC, home proxy plays the 
   role of a home agent for mobile nodes and mobile nodes set their CoA

   by the use of either stateful or stateless autoconfiguration. 
   Currently they MUST use IPsec in order to secure this process. 
   Section 4 of that RFC discusses the possibility of using another 
   algorithm in order to secure mobile nodes. 



3.1.3.  Other Applications 

   With the wide usage of IP addresses in different types of devices and 
   by the use of autoconfiguration mechanisms to configure these IP 
   addresses, the need for the use of a security algorithm is increased. 
   One type of application would for use in vehicular networks or car by 
   car networks. There is currently some work in progress that makes use 
   of Neighbor Discovery. SSAS could also be a solution for enabling 
   fast protection against ND attacks. 



4.  Algorithms Overview 

   As explained earlier, one of the problems with using the current IID 
   generation approach is the compute intensive processing that is 
   needed for the IID algorithm generation. Another concern is for the 
   lack of security. Since we assume that a node will need to generate 
   and keep its address for a short period of time, we have tried to 
   keep the IID generation process to a minimum. We have also tried to 
   remain within the confines of NDP protocol. Here we offer two 
   algorithms. The first algorithm is used where the purpose is a faster 
   algorithm with the security higher than CGA sec value 0. The second 
   algorithm addresses the problem with the security level and tries to 
   use the security of the whole public key during the first time 
   verification. 



4.1.  SSAS Algorithm 



4.1.1.  Interface ID (IID) Generation 

   To generate the IID a node will need to execute the following steps. 

   1. Generate key pairs (public/private keys) using ECC (RFC 6090) or 
   other available algorithms. ECC is the default algorithm, but any 
   algorithm capable of generating a small key size in a short amount of 
   time is viable. It is best to have the key pairs generated, on the 
   fly, during the start-up phase of the algorithm generation. These 
   keys SHOULD be valid for only a certain period of time which depends 
   on network policy. When the time expires for the use of these key 
   pairs, the node will generate new key pairs. It then uses this new 
   value for the generation of the IP address and signature. Comparing

INTERNET DRAFT       SSAS for Autoconfiguration         November 4, 2013

   the use of ECC to that of RSA shows that an ECC with a 192 bit key is 
   equivalent to a RSA with a 7680 bit key (according to US National 
   Security Agency) In this case the packet size would be decreased by a 
   factor 11 times smaller than that when using RSA. 

   2. Divide the public key array of bytes into two half byte arrays 
   (see figure 1). Obtain the first 4 bytes from the first half byte 
   array and call it the partial IID1. Obtain the first 4 bytes of the 
   second half byte array and call this the partial IID2. (Dividing 
   public key is only for having randomization) 

   3. Concatenate partial IID1 with partial IID2 and call this the IID. 

   4. Concatenate the IID with the local subnet prefix to set the local 
   IP address. 

   5. Concatenate the IID with the router subnet prefix (Global subnet 
   prefix), obtained from the Router Advertisement (RA) message, and set 
   it as a tentative public IP address. This IP address will become 
   permanent after Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) processing. (for 
   more information about DAD refer to section 4.1.3. ) 

   Note: In this document bits u and g does not have any particular 
   meaning and is used as a part of public key. This assumption is by 
   the clarification of using these bits in [3].

4.1.2.  Signature Generation 

   The SSAS signature is added to NDP messages in order to protect them 
   from IP spoofing and spoofing types of attack. SSAS will provide 
   proof of IP address ownership, as does the CGA generation algorithm, 
   but by using fewer steps. To generate the SSAS signature, the node 
   needs to execute the following steps: 

   1. Concatenate the timestamp with the MAC address, collision count, 
   algorithm type and the global (public) IP address. (see figure 2) 

   

+---------+-----------+---------------+--------------+

| 8 bytes |  6 bytes  |     3 bits    |    1 byte    |

   2. Sign the resulting value from step 1, using the ECC private key, 
   and call the resulting output the SSAS signature. 

   If NDP messages contain other data that must be protected, such as 
   important routing information, then this data SHOULD also be included 
   in the signature. The signature is designed for the inclusion of any 
   data needing protection. If there is no data that needs protection, 
   then the signature will only contain the timestamp, MAC address, 
   Collision count and Global IP address (Router subnet prefix plus 
   IID). 



4.1.3.  Generation of NDP Messages 

   After a node generates its IP address, it should then process 
   Duplicate Address Detection in order to avoid address collisions in 
   the network. In order to do this the node needs to generate a 
   Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message. The SSAS signature is added to 
   the ICMPv6 options of NS messages. The SSAS signature data field is 
   an extended version of the standard format of the RSA signature 
   option of SeND [RFC3971]. The timestamp option is the same as that 
   used with SEND. In the SSAS signature, the data field contains the 
   following items: type, length, reserved, Other Len, algorithm type, 
   collision count, subnet prefix, other option and padding.

   - Type: This option is set to 15. This is the sequential number used 
   in SeND to indicate a SSAS data field. 

   - Length: The length of the Signature Data field, including the Type, 
   Length, Reserved, Algorithm type, Signature and padding, must be a 
   multiple of eight. 

   - Reserved: A 2 byte field reserved for future use. The value must be 
   initialized to zero by the sender and should be ignored by the 
   receiver. 

   - Other Len: The length of other options in multiples of eight. The 
   length of this field is 1 byte. 

   - algorithm type: The algorithm used to generate key pairs and sign 
   the message. The length of this field is 1 byte. For ECC, this value 
   is 0. Future algorithms will start at one and increase from there. 

   - Collision count: When a collision occurs during the DAD, the node 
   will increment this value and store it in a file to be included in 
   the sent packets for as long as the current IP address is valid. This 
   value indicates to the node where it needs to start its check from, 
   i.e., the first or second or third bytes from the start of the half 
   byte array of the public key. 

   - Subnet Prefix: This is the router subnet prefix. 

   - Other Options. This variable-length field contains important data 
   that needs to be protected in the packet. The padding is used to 
   insure that the field is a multiple of eight in length. 

   - Padding. A variable-length field containing padding to insure that 
   the entire signature field is a multiple of eight in length. It thus 
   contains the number of blanks needed to make the entire signature 
   field end on a multiple of eight. 

   All NDP messages (except RS messages) SHOULD contain the SSAS 
   signature data field which allows receivers to verify senders. If a 
   node receives a solicited NA message in response to its NS message 
   showing that another node claims to own this address, then, after a 
   successful verification process, this node increments the collision 
   count by one and this value is used as explained in the ?Collision 
   count? item above. It will start from that section of the public key 
   for the generation of a new IP address. If the node receives the same 
   claim three times in a row, then it will consider it as an attack and 
   it will use that IP address. 

   This document proposes an update to the RFC 3971 in order to include 
   the the SSAS signature data field as an additional field to SeND to 
   be used in place of RSA signature.

4.1.4.  SSAS verification process 

   A node's verification process should start when it receives NDP 
   messages. Following are the steps used in the verification process: 

   1. Obtain the timestamp from the NDP message and call this value t1. 

   2. Obtain the timestamp from the node's system, convert it to UTC, 
   and call this value t2. 

   3. If (t2- x) < = t1 < = (t2 + x) go to step 4. Otherwise, the 
   message SHOULD be discarded without further processing. The value of 
   x is dependent on network delays and network policy. The 
   implementations MUST choose a flexible value for x based on the delay 
   in this network. 

   4. Obtain the public key from the RPKI node or by checking its own 
   neighboring cache. If no matches found in the node cache then 

   5. Compare this to its own public key. If it is not the same, go to 
   the next step. Otherwise, the message should be discarded without 
   further processing. (This step should be skipped when the node uses 
   the RPKI to obtain the other nodes? public key.) 

   6. Divide the public key into two arrays of byes. Based on the 
   collision count, start from the first, second or third bytes of 
   public key and select 4 bytes from each half byte array and call them 
   partial IID 1 and 2. Concatenate partial IID 1 with partial IID2. 
   Obtain the node?s source IP address. Compare this value with the 
   node's IID source IP. If it is the same, go to the next step. 
   Otherwise, discard the message without further processing. 

   7. Concatenate the timestamp with the MAC address, algorithm type, 
   collision count, sender?s Global IP address (subnet prefix and IID), 
   and other options (if any) and call this entity the plain message. 

   8. Obtain the SSAS signature from the SSAS signature data field. 
   Obtain the Algorithm type from the message. 

   9. Verify the Signature using the public key and then enter the plain 
   message and the SSAS signature as an input to the verification 
   function. If the verification process is successful, process the 
   message. Otherwise, the message should be discarded without further 
   processing. 

   

   After a successful verification, the node stores the public key and 
   MAC address of this node in its neighboring cache. The cache is valid 
   for a day.

4.2.  Resource Public key Infrastructure (RPKI) 

   To Authorized the Routers in the network and increase the security of 
   the nodes in this network, it is recommended to use an RPKI explained 
   in RFC 6494 and 6495. It is explained in more detail in [2] and a new 
   draft about rpki. 







5.  Security Considerations

   As a security consideration what one might ask oneself is what are 
   the odds of an attacker being able to generate a public key having 
   two four sequential bytes (from two different halves of public key) 
   that are the same as 62 bits of that in public key? If he could, he 
   could then generate the signature using his own private key and thus 
   break SSAS. 

   Mathematically it has been shown that the probability of matching 48 
   bits in the public key against 62 bits in the IID is about 
   pow(1/2,62) where pow is the power function, 2 is a base and 64 is an 
   exponent. in [2] the analysis of SSAS is explained and compared to 
   CGA. For CGA sec value 0, the attacker needs to do brute force 
   attacks against 59 bits. So SSAS v1 is more secure than CGA sec value 
   0. For SSAS v2, the attacker needs to do brute force attacks against 
   the whole public key. So the security of that is depends on the 
   security of public key algorithm and the key size. 



6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new algorithm for the generation of an 
   Interface ID in IPv6 networks that provides IP layer privacy and 
   local link security. 



7.  Conclusions

   This document introduced two fast secure algorithms that might be 
   used to also maintain the user's privacy. It eliminates the compute 
   intensive process of CGA.
