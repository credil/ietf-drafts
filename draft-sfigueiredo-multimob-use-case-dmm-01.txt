Abstract

   As mobile networks are moving towards distributed mobility management,
   the application of IP multicast is needed to provide efficient
   content delivery on the network. This document describes use cases
   when IP multicast is applied on PMIPv6-based DMM, and analyzes
   problems focused on user plane issues.

Internet-Draft       Use Cases for Multicast DMM             March 2012


1. Introduction

   As a consequence of the forthcoming multimedia avalanche, several
   optimization mechanisms are being considered towards efficient and
   resilient mobile networks. As analyzed in [DDMM-MI], current IP
   mobility management solutions have limitations in supporting
   efficient management and deployment. Thus, several proposals aiming
   at the distribution of the mobility management functions (e.g [DDMM-
   FP] were presented. The problems resulting from the application of
   mobility solutions in multicast traffic are known, affecting its
   efficiency and leading to non-negligible service disruption, reported
   among others ([IPMM][RFC5757]). Nevertheless, it is still not clear
   how the change from centralized to distributed mobility solutions may
   affect IP multicast support.

   This document briefly describes use cases of IP multicast in a
   PMIPv6-based DMM environment, and analyses consequent problems. Both
   listener and sender perspective are studied, with either MLD Proxy or
   Multicast Router functionality deployed at the Mobility Access Router
   (MAR).

2. Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5213], [RFC6275],
   and [RFC3810], and [RFC4601]. Specifically, the definition of PMIPv6
   domain is reused from [RFC5213] and reproduced here for completeness.

     - Mobility Access Router (MAR): A router with the capability of
     acting both as a mobility anchor and as an access router, in a per
     flow basis.

     - Previous Mobility Access Router (P-MAR): The MAR where the MN was
     attached to previously to the network-layer mobility process, and
     that may be acting as an anchor for one or multiple flows.

     - New Mobile Access Gateway (N-MAR): The MAR to which the MN is
     currently attached, providing the access functionality and thus
     delivers all the flows destined to the MN.

     - Multicast Listener Discovery Proxy (MLD-P): An entity following
     [RFC4605].

3. Use Cases Description

   This draft focuses on describing problems that may occur when
   deploying IP multicast on a general PMIPv6-derived DMM architecture.
   As there is not yet a fully specified unicast DMM protocol, the
   unicast DMM concept used in this document is assumed as follows: MAG
   and an LMA functionalities defined in [RFC5213] are equipped within a
   same physical entity, called MAR. A MAR provides tunnel-based
   forwarding to provide a home network prefix (HNP)-based flow with the
   necessary IP session continuity whenever the MN moves to another MAR.

      We separate the use cases in multicast listener and multicast
   sender support.

3.1. Multicast listener support

3.1.1. MLD-P in MAR

   Once a MN initially attaches to the P-MAR (as shown in Figure 1), it
   receives a home prefix address, which will be associated with
   communications started at that MAR. Detecting the new logical link,
   the P-MAR transmits to it a general MLD Query message, to which the
   MN will not yet reply. Thus, the P-MAR adds the downstream logical
   link to the MLD-P instance with uplink to the multicast
   infrastructure. When the MN intends to start receiving the multicast
   session, it will send an unsolicited MLD Report. On receiving the
   latter message, the MLD-P tries to join the multicast channel(s) by
   sending an aggregated MLD Report (with other MN's interests) through
   the MLD-P upstream interface. When the joining procedure ends,
   multicast data is transmitted through the same interface.

     Figure 1    Multicasting architecture using distributed mobility
                                management

      When the MN moves from P-MAR, the N-MAR is required to establish a
   tunnel for IP session continuity of the flows being sent towards the
   MN's HNP assigned by the P-MAR. This implies that N-MAR determines
   the MNs previous HNPs, being the exact method through which this is
   achieved out of scope of this document. Following the operation of
   the MLD-P [RFC4605], after the bidirectional tunnel establishment,
   the following process takes place. First, the N-MAR sends a General
   MLD Query, and verifies whether the MN is admissible for multicast
   sessions. If so, the MLD-P at the N-MAR adds the downstream interface
   corresponding to the MN, and configures the upstream interface
   towards the MN's P-MAR. Like in PMIPv6 base solution for multicast
   support [RFC6224], this is simple and applicable as a network-based
   multicast DMM approach. However, this approach leads to a couple of
   relevant issues.

3.1.1.1. Duplicated Traffic

   One of those problems is duplicated traffic, a result of the tunnel
   convergence problem occurring in [RFC6224]. As shown in Figure 2, MN1
   and MN3, which moved from MAR1 and MAR3, respectively, are currently
   located at the MAR2. Through respective established tunnels, they
   receive multicast packets of the same channel through different
   anchoring MARs. This causes duplicated traffic, converging to the
   MAR2, with the magnitude of replicated traffic being much bigger than
   that of PMIPv6. This consideration is done assuming that the number

   of MARs in future DMMdomains will be much larger than that of LMAs at
   core level within a PMIPv6 domain.

      As referred, when a MN first subscribes multicast content, its
   current MAR's MLD-P will forward its subscription to the multicast
   infrastructure. As such, an extra duplication factor may occur, if
   the subscription being done is already being received from one or
   multiple tunnels due to other listeners (refer to MN2 from Figure 2
   for an example).

3.1.1.2. Non-optimal routing

      Another issue is non-optimal routing (Figure 3). If we consider a
   significantly large domain, there is the possibility that the
   multicast packets need to traverse a long distance, depending on the
   setup of the upstream interface of MLD-P instance, even if the
   current MAR is connected to the multicast infrastructure. If an
   operator wants to deploy a MLD-P instance with the upstream interface
   towards multicast source or multicast routing network, for each MAR,
   this issue doesn't happen. Such an approach is extremely simple and

3.2.1. MLD-P in MAR

3.2.1.1. Triangular routing

      When a source is transmitting a multicast session and a mobility
   process takes place, i.e the session is anchored through another MAR
   (MAR1 in Figure 5), then multicast data will be sent through the
   mobility tunnel between N-MAR (MAR2) and P-MAR (MAR1). A listener
   (L1) that subscribed to the source's channel as is attached at the
   same MAR (MAR2) will receive the multicast content from multicast
   infrastructure. Therefore the traffic will traverse a non-optimal
   route between the source and the listener.

   The same problem also occurs in the opposite process, i.e. if a

   a listener moves to the same MAR while receiving the source's content
   (Figure 6).

   When the source and the listener are within a same MAR (MAR2)if both
   the source and listener try to start the session and receive it,
   respectively at MAR2, the traffic will be optimally sent to the
   listener. As the traffic reaches the MLD-P via the downstream
   interface to which the source is attached, it will be sent through
   the interface to which the listener sent the MLD Report. However, if
   the source and the listener move to different MARs, the traffic will
   traverse the following non-optimal path, even though they share a
   common MAR2:

     Source -> MAR1 -> MAR2 -> Multicast Tree -> MAR2 -> MAR3

   This problem is depicted in Figure 7.
