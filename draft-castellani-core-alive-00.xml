<section title="Introduction">

        <t>In the context of a Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE),
        hosts could frequently be energy-constrained
        and be turned off the vast majority of time
        for energy-saving purposes.</t>
        
        <t>In the case of a CoAP server, while it is offline,
        it is neither available to serve requests.
        Clients desiring to access its resources
        have no way to understand when they will find it up again.</t> 

        <t>This specification provides a simple new message
        that gives to a CoAP server the ability to signal
        its current availability in the network.</t>
        
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Alive (ALV) Message Type">

    <t>This specification defines a new message type for the CoAP message-layer
    (see Section 4.4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>).
    The type of a message is specified by the T field of the CoAP header.</t>
    
    <t>An "Alive" message (ALV) indicates that a CoAP server is up and ready to serve requests.
    Alive shares T value with the Non-Confirmable (NON) message type,
    but is univocally distinguishable by the fact that it MUST be empty.</t>
    
    <t>When a client receives an ALV message from a server,
    if it is interested in any resource served by it,
    the client SHOULD try sending a request to it
    since the Alive message provides an indication of its current availability.</t>
    
</section>

<section title="Examples">
        <t><xref target="ex-alive"/> shows a sample use case
        where a server notifies its wake up to clients using multicast.</t>

<!--
        <t>Note: The Alive message could be used by a server
        to signal an expiring Observe session.
        When an Observe session has been up for Max-Age seconds
        without any change in the resource state,
        it MAY send to the client an ALV message,
        to indicate that it is available to setup a new Observe session
        for that resource.</t>
