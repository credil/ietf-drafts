   Preventing spoofing attacks in BGP-MPLS-VPN Inter-Provider Model-C
             draft-bhargav-l3vpn-inter-provider-optcsec-00



Abstract

   In certain models of inter-provider Multi-Protocol-Label-Switching
   based Virtual Private Networks (MPLS-VPNs), spoofing attacks against
   VPN sites is a key concern. Unidirectional attacks towards VPN sites
   can compromise servers at the VPN sites and cause Denial-of-Service
   (DoS) situations. Currently, the inner labels associated with VPN
   sites are not encrypted during transmission. The Provider Edge (PE)
   router at the end to which the VPN customer is attached accepts any
   data packet with a valid label. This enables a man-in-the-middle
   attacker to spoof a packet to a specific site of a VPN. In this
   paper, we propose some secure techniques which provide security
   against such label-spoofing. These techniques ensure that an attacker
   would not be able to spoof labeled data packets. In order to make the
   proposed scheme robust, some additional steps are proposed over and
   above the initial steps specified. This makes the attacker to spend
   non-linear time to guess the right label for his unidirectional
   attacks to succeed. Our proposed technique can be applied to a
   specific type of inter-provider Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) based
   MPLS VPN and other existing variant where Multi-Protocol exterior-
   BGP (MP-eBGP) multi-hop is used. In future, if any other variant is
   proposed to use MP-eBGP multi-hop, our scheme can be used to protect
   against spoofing attacks.

INTERNET DRAFT  Securing Inter-provider MPLS-VPN Model-C   February 2012


1  Introduction

   MPLS technology helps forward data packets in the Internet using
   fixed-size labels [3]. By stacking labels (label-stacking technique),
   specific customer services such as layer 3 VPNs based on BGP
   extensions are widely deployed in the Internet. BGP based MPLS layer
   3 VPN services are provided either on a single internet service
   provider (ISP) core or across multiple ISP cores. The latter cases
   are known as inter-provider MPLS VPNs which are broadly categorized
   and referred to as models: A, B and C. Model A uses back-to-back VPN
   Routing and Forwarding (VRF) connections between Autonomous System
   Border Routers (ASBRs). Model B uses eBGP redistribution of labelled
   VPN-IPv4 routes from AS to neighbouring AS. Model C uses multi-hop
   eBGP redistribution of labelled VPNIPv4 routes and eBGP
   redistribution of IPv4 routes from AS to neighbouring AS. Please
   refer [1] for more details. A. Security issues in inter-provider VPN
   models Model A is as secure a standard as the single-Autonomous
   System (AS) standard proposed in [5]. Model B can be secured well on
   the control plane, but on the data-plane the top-most label is not
   checked for validity. This weakness could be exploited to inject
   crafted packets from inside an MPLS core into the other. There is a
   work-around discussed in [1] that solves the problem. Model C can
   also be secured well on the control plane. But as the ASBRs do not
   have any VPN information and the inner-most label cannot be
   validated, the data-plane has architectural weakness with respect to
   security. This enables unidirectional packets to be sent into the VPN
   sites connected to the other AS, which cannot be protected against by
   mere configuration. Model C can therefore only be deployed where
   service providers trust each other. For more details refer to [1].


   In [2] the authors propose encryption techniques, such as IPSec, for
   securing the provider edge (PE) to PE legs of the network. However
   the authors also highlight that the processing capacity could be
   over-burdened. If an attacker is located at the core of the network,
   or in the intermediate link or network between the providers that
   constitute a inter-provider MPLS VPN solution, then spoofing attacks
   are possible. In case an attacker spoofs the inner labels that
   identify packets going towards a L3 VPN site, sensitive information
   related to services available within the organizational servers can
   be compromised. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack could also be
   launched against these sensitive sites. As far as we know, there is
   no scheme adopting encryption available for installing an anti-
   spoofing mechanism for these VPN service labels. The proposed scheme
   in this document provides an alternative in case other schemes that
   dont adopt encryption are not suitable. The PEs at the end to which
   the VPN customer is attached will accept any packet with a valid
   label and will forward it to the VPN customer. There is no way to

   ensure the veracity of a spoofed packet.

1.1 Security issue in model C

   The deficiency discussed above is particularly true in the case of
   inter-provider BGP based MPLS VPN model C. Even though model C is
   highly scalable for carrying VRF routes, the vulnerability of the
   data-plane has rendered it unusable and the current recommendation is
   that model C must not be used. As discussed in [1] the insecurity for
   model C stems from the fact that anybody within the core of the
   network or at the peering points of the providers can cause DoS
   attacks or worm attacks. It is possible to filter all IP traffic with
   the exception of the required eBGP peering between the AS border
   routers thereby preventing a large number of potential IP traffic
   related attacks. Labelled packets, however, are much harder to
   control. In model C, there are at least two labels for each packet:
   the PE label, which defines the Label Switched Path (LSP) to the
   egress PE, and the VPN label, which defines the VPN on the PE to
   which the packet is associated.

1.2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Methodology of the Proposal


   Consider a setup as below


   The reference MPLS-eBGP based VPN network for model-C / Option-C as
   described in [11] is shown in Figure 1, which also shows the control
   plane exchanges. The near-end PE (PE_ne) and far-end PE (PE_fa) are
   connected through the inter-provider MPLS core. The VPN connectivity
   is established through a set of routers from different Autonomous
   Systems (AS) and their ASBRs. In the VPN, MP-eBGP updates are
   exchanged for a set of Forward Equivalence Classes (FECs). These
   FECs, which have to be protected, originate from the prefixes behind
   PE_ne in a VPN site or a set of VPN sites.

   ( LDP Label:POP    LDP Label:L1 )     (LDP Label:L3  LDP Label:L4)
   (        |                 |    )     (  |                    |  )
   (        |                 |    )     (  |                    |  )
   [CE1]<-[PE_ne]__________[ASBR1]<---->[ASBR2]_________________[PE_fa]
                                                                      |
   172.18.10.0/24                 NH:PE_ne          172.18.20.0/24 [CE2]
                                  VPN Label: Inner Label IL1



   For the example below we refer to PE_ne and PE_fa in the diagram as
   PE-1 and PE-2.

   1) PE-1 and PE-2 would establish a MPeBGP-VPNV4 session between them

   2) PE-1 and PE-2 will exchange a VPN-label between them which is used
   during forwarding

   3) This provides a way for customers of PE-1 to use same address
   space because different routing context is provided for different
   customer at PE

   4) This mechanism does not avoid an attacker who is trying to spoof a
   packet somewhere inside the core 

   There are 2 ways to solve this problem

2.1.1 Control Plane operation

   1) PE-1 and PE-2 agree upon looking for "Secure Label" in addition to
   VPN label

   2) PE-1 and PE-2 use PKE and publish their respective public keys.

            +-------------- MP-eBGP IPVPN-V4 session --------------+    
               
            (2) PKE exchange to exchange their respective public keys.

   3) PE-1 and PE-2 also agree upon a universal hashing algorithm to
   use. It could be any of standard universal hashing algorithm which
   minimizes collisions to the maximum extent possible. They also agree
   upon a bitmask that is to be used in step 5.1. These could be
   exchanged using the MP-eBGP label exchange mechanism using suitable
   fields which will be discussed in the appendix A.1.

   4) Unlike VPN label that is exchanged as part MPBGP-VPNV4 operation,
   "Secure Label" is generated on fly during forwarding.

   	5.1) First take an hash on the first 256 bytes of the packet's
   payload received using the universal hashing algorithm agreed upon.
   If the PEs are from the same vendor or from a different vendor the
   algorithm to use is expressed in a standard identifier which is
   understood by both PEs.

   	5.2) Take any 20 bits from the hash using a bitmask that is also
   shared amongst the two PEs.

   	5.3) Take this 20 bit value and encrypt with the private key of PE-2
   if traffic is flowing from PE-2 to PE-1. The inner label, universal
   hashing algorithm and the bitmask are sent from PE-1 to PE-2 for
   prefixes reachable via PE-1.

   1) Let us assume a customer connected to PE-2 is sending a packet to 
      PE-1

   2) The packet could be any payload encapsulated in the MPLS header
   having a stack of labels for MODEL-C

   3) When the packet reaches PE-2, following operation is done

   	3.1) Generate an hash of the received packet using the universal    
              hashing algorithm chosen.

   	3.2) Take agreed 20 bits from the hash using the bitmask exchanged. 
              (Text below talks about what 20 bits to take)

   	3.3) Encrypt those 20 bits with PE-2's private key

   label

   	4.2) Take agreed 20 bits using bitmask agreed upon after hash       
              calculation in #4.1 by PE-1, call it 'K'

   	4.3) Decrypt received secured-label using public key of PE-1

   	4.4) Check if decrypted secured label and K are same. 

   	4.5) If both are same then forward the packet otherwise drop them

2.1.3 Mapping a hash to a 20 bit value

   1) The universal hashing algorithm selected generates a 128 bit value
   but a MPLS label is 20 bit value

   2) A mechanism is necessary to map 128 bit to 20 bit

   3) PE-1 and PE-2 would exchange a 128 bitmask which is used to convey
       what 20 bits in that 128 bits is to be used for the purposes of
   encryption

   4) This bitmask / bitmap is generated randomly and exchanged at the
   time of MP-eBGP NLRI exchanges and expires every t seconds.

   5) Whenever a new bitmap is generated, this would be shared between
   the PE's

   MP-eBGP update which would tell the other PE (far-end PE) that a
   digital signature mechanism is to be used for purposes of protecting
   the payload / stream between the two PEs.

   1) Let us assume a customer connected to PE-1 is sending a packet    
      to PE-2

   2) The packet could be any payload encapsulated in the MPLS header
   having a stack of labels for MODEL-C

   3) When the packet reaches PE-1, following operation is done

   	3.1) Generate a hash of the received packet involving the first     
              256 bytes of the packet.

   	3.2) Encrypt the hash with private key of PE-1.

   	3.3) Add this encrypted 128 bit below EOS label

   	3.4) Send the packet with VPN label and with encrypted              
              digital signature below EOS label

   4) When the packet reaches PE-2, following operation is done

   	4.1) Based on the VPN label, PE-2 knows that it needs to look for   
              digital signature below EOS label

   	4.2) Remove 128 bit digital signature below EOS label

   	4.3) Calculate a hash after removing the digital signature,         
              call it 'J'

   	4.4) Decrypt the received digital signature with public key of      
             PE-1, Call it 'K'

   	4.5) compare the J and K. If they are equal, forward                
              the packet else drops them

   Note:

   1) For both solutions, hash is calculated only before slapping VPN
   label at PE-1, ie all TTL update gets over by then

   2) In case of Solution 2, to support ECMP case, we can add one nibble
   extra in front of digital signature based on IPV4/IPV6

2.3 Use Case:1

   1) The above case talks about usage of this mechanism in VPN case

2.4 Use Case:2 (RSVP can use this during tunnel setup)

   1) Head-end during tunnel setup can inform tail-end about "Secured-
   Label" during setup

   2) We can use any of the above solutions for LSP setup as well.

2.5 Advantages

   1) Any attackers packet would have to guess a 40 bit label in the
   case of Solution 1 and a 20 + 128-bit DS label in Solution 2.

   2) Since we are using PKE, it is impossible for an attacker to create
   a packet with same semantics of PE, since he would have to guess the
   Algorithm UA(x) and the bitmask patten in Solution (1) and the PKE
   key as well. In Solution (2) he would have to guess the PKE key and
   the Algorithm UA(x).

   3) Provides real security from attacker in the case of a man-in-the-
   middle attack say from the intervening network between the two
   providers.

   5) The same mechanism could be used by RSVP for tunnel setup between
   Head-end and tail-end. Head-end during RSVP set-up can inform tail-
   end to use the "Secured-Label" mechanismor the DS mechanism in
   Solution 1 and Solution 2 respectively.

2.6 Limitations

   1) An additional decryption and hashing is necessary in PE for
   secured labels in Solution 2 and in Solution 1 a bitmask lookup and
   selection is required over and above the decryption and hashing.

   2) This mechanism will not work if this packet is fragmented inside
   the core.

3  Security Considerations

      PKE is a secure mechanism as established in common security
      parlance. The control plane is secure in Option-C / Model-C in
      Inter-provider VPNs. It would take more than polynomial time
      complexity for an attacker to compromise the traffic using this
      mechanism.

4  IANA Considerations

      IANA needs to assign the Type value for exchanging the additional
      details in the control plane as illustrated in the above two
      solutions.
