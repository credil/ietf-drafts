Abstract

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
   contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) management information.  The intent is that
   these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in MPLS
   related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
   representations.  This document obsoletes RFC3811 as it addresses the
   need to support IPv6 extended TunnelID's by defining a new TC-
   MplsNewExtendedTunnelID which suggests using IPv4 address of the
   ingress or egress LSR for the tunnel for an IPv6 network.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module which contains Textual Conventions
   for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  These Textual
   Conventions should be imported by MIB modules which manage MPLS
   networks.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   For an introduction to the concepts of MPLS, see [RFC3031].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58
   ([RFC2578], [RFC2579], and [RFC2580]).

   DESCRIPTION
   "A unique identifier for an MPLS Tunnel.  This may
   represent an IPv4 address of the ingress or egress
   LSR for the tunnel.  This value is derived from the
   Extended Tunnel Id in RSVP or the Ingress Router ID

   MplsLabel ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS        current
   DESCRIPTION
   "This value represents an MPLS label as defined in
   [RFC3031],  [RFC3032], [RFC3034], [RFC3035] and
   [RFC3471].

   The label contents are specific to the label being
   represented, such as:

   * The label carried in an MPLS shim header
     (for LDP this is the Generic Label) is a 20-bit
     number represented by 4 octets.  Bits 0-19 contain
     a label or a reserved label value.  Bits 20-31
     MUST be zero.

   The following is quoted directly from [RFC3032].
   There are several reserved label values:

   i.   A value of 0 represents the
        'IPv4 Explicit NULL Label'.  This label
        value is only legal at the bottom of the
        label stack.  It indicates that the label
        stack must be popped, and the forwarding
        of the packet must then be based on the
        IPv4 header.

   ii.  A value of 1 represents the
        'Router Alert Label'.  This label value is
        legal anywhere in the label stack except at
        the bottom.  When a received packet
        contains this label value at the top of
        the label stack, it is delivered to a
        local software module for processing.
        The actual forwarding of the packet

Internet-Draft          MPLS Textual Conventions             August 2012


        is determined by the label beneath it
        in the stack.  However, if the packet is
        forwarded further, the Router Alert Label
        should be pushed back onto the label stack
        before forwarding.  The use of this label
        is analogous to the use of the
        'Router Alert Option' in IP packets
        [RFC2113].  Since this label
        cannot occur at the bottom of the stack,
        it is not associated with a
        particular network layer protocol.

   iii. A value of 2 represents the
        'IPv6 Explicit NULL Label'.  This label
        value is only legal at the bottom of the
        label stack.  It indicates that the label
        stack must be popped, and the forwarding
        of the packet must then be based on the
        IPv6 header.

   iv.  A value of 3 represents the
        'Implicit NULL Label'.
        This is a label that an LSR may assign and
        distribute, but which never actually
        appears in the encapsulation.  When an
        LSR would otherwise replace the label
        at the top of the stack with a new label,
        but the new label is 'Implicit NULL',
        the LSR will pop the stack instead of
        doing the replacement.  Although
        this value may never appear in the
        encapsulation, it needs to be specified in
        the Label Distribution Protocol, so a value
        is reserved.

   v.   Values 4-15 are reserved.

   * The frame relay label can be either 10-bits or
     23-bits depending on the DLCI field size and the
     upper 22-bits or upper 9-bits must be zero,
     respectively.

   * For an ATM label the lower 16-bits represents the
     VCI, the next 12-bits represents the VPI and the
     remaining bits MUST be zero.

   * The Generalized-MPLS (GMPLS) label contains a
     value greater than 2^24-1 and used in GMPLS

   MplsLSPID ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

   DESCRIPTION
   "A unique identifier within an MPLS network that is
   assigned to each LSP.  This is assigned at the head
   end of the LSP and can be used by all LSRs
   to identify this LSP.  This value is piggybacked by
   the signaling protocol when this LSP is signaled
   within the network.  This identifier can then be
   used at each LSR to identify which labels are
   being swapped to other labels for this LSP.  This
   object  can also be used to disambiguate LSPs that
   share the same RSVP sessions between the same
   source and destination.

   For LSPs established using CR-LDP, the LSPID is
   composed of the ingress LSR Router ID (or any of
   its own IPv4 addresses) and a locally unique
   CR-LSP ID to that LSR.  The first two bytes carry
   the CR-LSPID, and the remaining 4 bytes carry
   the Router ID.  The LSPID is useful in network
   management, in CR-LSP repair, and in using
   an already established CR-LSP as a hop in
   an ER-TLV.

   For LSPs signaled using RSVP-TE, the LSP ID is
   defined as a 16-bit (2 byte) identifier used
   in the SENDER_TEMPLATE and the FILTER_SPEC
   that can be changed to allow a sender to
   share resources with itself.  The length of this
   object should only be 2 or 6 bytes.  If the length
   of this octet string is 2 bytes, then it must
   identify an RSVP-TE LSPID, or it is 6 bytes,
   it must contain a CR-LDP LSPID."

   unknown(0)   An unknown address type.  This value
   MUST be used if the value of the
   corresponding TeHopAddress object is a
   zero-length string.  It may also be
   used to indicate a TeHopAddress which
   is not in one of the formats defined
   below.

   DESCRIPTION
   "Denotes a generic Tunnel hop address,
   that is, the address of a node which
   an LSP traverses, including the source
   and destination nodes.  An address may be
   very concrete, for example, an IPv4 host
   address (i.e., with prefix length 32);
   if this IPv4 address is an interface
   address, then that particular interface
   must be traversed.  An address may also
   specify an 'abstract node', for example,
   an IPv4 address with prefix length
   less than 32, in which case, the LSP
   can traverse any node whose address
   falls in that range.  An address may
   also specify an Autonomous System (AS),
   in which  case the LSP can traverse any
   node that falls within that AS.

   the context of an TeHopAddressType value.  Every

   which provides the context.  It is suggested that
   the TeHopAddressType object is logically registered
   before the object(s) which use the TeHopAddress
   TEXTUAL-CONVENTION if they appear in the
   same logical row.

   The value of a TeHopAddress object must always be
   consistent with the value of the associated
   TeHopAddressType object.  Attempts to set a
   TeHopAddress object to a value which is
   inconsistent with the associated TeHopAddressType
   must fail with an inconsistentValue error."

4.  Effect of the new TC

   The new TC definition for the MPLS Tunnel will have an effect on the
   MPLS-TE-MIB and MPLS-TC-STD-MIB.  Also the following RFC's which use
   the MIB may have to be updated to accomodate the changed definition:
   [RFC3209], [RFC3812], [RFC3813], [RFC3212], [RFC4368], [RFC3814],
   [RFC3815], and [RFC6639].


5.  Contributors

   This MIB fixes a small issue with the earlier version of this MIB as
   defined in RFC3811.The earlier document was created by combining
   TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS from current MPLS MIBs and a TE-WG MIB.  Co-
   authors on each of these MIBs contributed to the TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS
   contained in this MIB and also contributed greatly to the revisions
   of this document.  These co-authors are:

6.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Adrian Farrel and Thomas Nadeau for
   thier guidance.  The earlier editors and contributors would like to
   thank Mike MacFadden and Adrian Farrel for their helpful comments on
   several reviews.  Also, a special acknowledgement to Bert Wijnen for
   his many detailed reviews.  Bert's assistance and guidance is greatly
   appreciated.


7.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MPLS
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has made a MIB OID assignment under the transmission branch,
   that is, assigned the mplsStdMIB under { transmission 166 }.  This
   sub-id is requested because 166 is the ifType for mpls(166) and is
   available under transmission.

   In the future, MPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.  The IANA is requested to manage
   that namespace.  New assignments can only be made via a Standards
   Action as specified in [RFC2434].

   The IANA has also assigned { mplsStdMIB 1 } to the MPLS-TC-STD-MIB
   specified in this document.
