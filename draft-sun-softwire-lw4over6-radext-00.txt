Abstract

   lightweight 4over6(lw4over6) [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an
   extension to DS-Lite in which the amount of state maintained in
   lwAFTR has been reduced to per-subscriber-level.  The lwB4 needs to
   be provisioned with the public IPv4 address and port set it is
   allowed to use.  The DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Transport [I.D-ietf-dhc-
   dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
   Option for Port Set [I.D-sun-dhc-port-set-option] can be used for
   lwB4 to provison with the public IPv4 address and port set.

   However, in many networks, the configuration information may be
   stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers
   while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway
   (BNG).  This document defines a Remote Authentication Dial In User
   Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries lightweight 4over6
   configuration information from AAA server to BNG.

Internet-Draft   Radius Extension for Lightweight 4over6       July 2013


1.  Introduction

   Lightweight 4over6 (lw4over6) [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] defines a
   model for providing IPv4 access over an IPv6 network in which the
   Network Address Translation (NAT) function is performed by the
   Customer-Premises Equipment (CPE) instead of being centralized on a
   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN).  Lightweight 4over6 features keeping per-
   subscriber binding state in the service provider's network.  This
   per-subscriber binding state is assigned by the provisioning system
   and should be syncronized between lwAFTR.  [I.D-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-
   dhcpv6] has defined a unified server to distribute IPv4 information
   through IPv6-only network.  It can be combined with [I.D-sun-dhc-
   port-set-option] to provision the public IPv4 address and and port-
   set.

   In many networks, user configuration information may be managed by
   AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) servers.  Current
   AAA servers communicate using the Remote Authentication Dial In User
   Service (RADIUS) [RFC2865] protocol.  In a fixed line broadband
   network, the Broadband Network Gateways (BNGs) act as the access
   gateway of users.  For lw4over6 case, the BNGs are assumed to embed a
   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 server function which allows them to locally
   handle any DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 requests issued by hosts.  The
   operators may per-configure subscriber's binding state in AAA server
   which then passes the information to a BNG and in turn populates the
   mapping of the subscribe.

   This document defines a new RADIUS attribute that can be used in
   lightweight 4over6 to carry subscriber's binding state.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is used
   extensively in this document.


3.  Lightweight 4over6 configuration process with RADIUS

   The below Figure 1 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv4-
   over-DHCPv6 cooperate to provide lwB4 with the binding state.

   Figure 1: Lightweight 4over6 configuration process with RADIUS case 1

   BNGs act as a client of RADIUS and as a Unified server.  The lwB4
   will firstly get the IPv6 address via DHCPv6 process.  It then
   initiates a BOOTREQUESTV6 DHCPDISCOVER request with PORT_SET Option.
   Since the lwB4 has known the address of the Unified server in
   advance, it is recommanded to send the BOOTREQUESTV6 message using
   unicast address.  When receving the BOOTREQUESTV6 from lwB4, the BNG
   SHOULD intercept the subscriber's IPv6 address and stored locally.
   Then, the BNG SHOULD initiate a RADIUS Access-Request message, in
   which the User-Name attribute (1) SHOULD be filled by the lwB4 MAC
   address, to the RADIUS server,the User-password attribute (2) SHOULD
   be filled by the shared lw4over6 password that has been preconfigured
   on the DHCPv6 server to get lw4over6 attribute.  The IPv6 address in
   lw4o6 attribute should be filled by the subscriber's IPv6 address.
   The AAA server will then determine the IPv4 address and Port Set for
   the subscriber.

   The subscriber's binding state should be syncronized between AAA
   server and lwAFTR.  If the bindings are pre-configured statically in
   both AAA server and lwAFTR, the AAA server does not need to configure
   lwAFTR anymore.  Otherwise, if the bindings are locally creately in

   AAA server on-demand, it should inform the lwAFTR with the
   subscriber's binding state using [I-D.zhou-dime-4over6-provisioning]
   or COA requests.

   Figure 2 describes another scenario -- later re-authorization -- in
   which the authorization operation is not coupled with authentication.
   Authorization relevant to lw4o6 is done independently after the
   authentication process.

   In this scenario, it is also recommanded that unicast IPv6 address is
   used in BOOTREQUESTV6 and BOOTREPLYV6.  The Access-Request packet
   SHOULD contain a Service- Type attribute (6) with the value Authorize
   Only (17); thus, according to [RFC5080], the Access-Request packet
   MUST contain a State attribute that it obtains from the previous
   authentication process.

   In both above-mentioned scenarios, Message-Authenticator (type 80)
   [RFC2865] SHOULD be used to protect both Access-Request and Access-
   Accept messages.

   After receiving the lw4over6-binding attribute in the initial Access-
   Accept, the BNG SHOULD store the received lw4over6 configuration
   parameters locally.  When the lw4over6 CE sends a DHCP Request
   message to request an extension of the lifetime for the assigned
   address, the BNG does not have to initiate a new Access-Request
   towards the AAA server to request the lw4o6 binding state.  The BNG
   could retrieve the previously stored lw4o6 configuration parameters
   and use them in its reply.  The BNG will then inform the AAA server
   with updated lifetime.

   If the BNG does not receive the lw4over6-binding attribute in the
   Access-Accept or if the BNG receives an Access-Reject, the tunnel
   cannot be established.


4.  Attributes

   This section defines the lw4o6_binding attribute that is used in both
   above-mentioned scenarios.  The attribute design follows [RFC6158]
   and refers to [RFC6929].

4.1.  lw4o6_binding Attribute

   The lw4o6_binding RADIUS attribute contains the subscriber's binding
   information including IPv6 address, IPv4 address and the port-set.
   The BNG SHALL use the binding entry returned in the RADIUS
   lw4o6_binding attribute to populate the DHCPv4-over-dhcpv6 requests.

   If the BNG includes the lw4o6_binding attribute, but the AAA server
   does not recognize it, this attribute MUST be ignored by the AAA
   server.

   If the BNG does not receive the lw4o6_binding attribute in the
   Access-Accept message and there is the unified server in BNG is not
   configured to allocate the port-set by itself, the unified SHOULD not
   response and the tunnel can not be established.

   When the Access-Request message is triggered by a DHCP Rebind
   message, if the binding attribute received in the Access-Accept
   message is different from the currently used one for that session,
   the BNG MUST force the lwB4 to re-establish the tunnel using the new
   binding information received in the Access-Accept message.

   The lw4o6_binding Attribute is structured as follows:
