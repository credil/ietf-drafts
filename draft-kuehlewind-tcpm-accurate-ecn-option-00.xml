   <abstract>
	   <t>This document specifies an TCP option to get accurate Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) feedback from the receiver. ECN is an IP/TCP mechanism where network nodes 
     can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate congestion to the end-points. 
     An ECN-capable receiver will feedback this information to the sender. ECN is specified for
     TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).
     Recently new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or DCTCP need more accurate feedback information in the case 
     where more than one marking is received in one RTT. This TCP extension can be used in addition to the classic ECN as well as with a more accurate ECN scheme recently proposed which reuses the ECN bit in the TCP header.

   <section title="Introduction">
	   <t>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"/> is 
		   an IP/TCP mechanism where
		   network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate congestion to
		   the end-points. An ECN-capable receiver will feedback this information to the sender.
		   ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can be
		   transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).
		   Recently proposed mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or DCTCP 
		   <xref target="Ali10"/> need more accurate feedback information 
		   in case when more than one marking is received in one RTT. 
     </t>
     
     <t>This documents specifies an TCP option to provide more than one ECN feedback signal per RTT. 
	     This modification does not obsolete <xref target="RFC3168"/>. 
	     This TCP extension can be used in addition to the classic ECN as well as 
	     in addition to more accurate ECN scheme recently proposed which reuses the ECN bits in the TCP header 
	     for the same purpose than this extension --- more accurate ECN feedback (see <xref target="I-D.kuehlewind-conex-accurate-ecn"/>).
	     Note that a new TCP extension can experience deployment problems by middleboxes dropping unknown options.
	     Thus the ECN feedback in the TCP header is still needed to ensure ECN feedback. Moreover, this option
	     will increase the header length for all kind of TCP packets which causes additional load in case of 
	     severe congestion.
     </t>
     
     <section title="Overview ECN and ECN Nonce in TCP">
	     <t>ECN requires two bits in the IP header. The ECN capability of a packet is indicated, 
	     	when either one of the two bits is set. An ECN sender can set one or the other bit to indicate 
		an ECN-capable transport (ETC)
		     which results in two signals --- ECT(0) and respectively ECT(1). 
		     A network node can set both bits simultaneously 
	     	when it experiences congestion. When both bits are
		     set the packets is regarded as "Congestion Experienced" (CE).
	     </t>
		     
	     <t>
		     ECN-Nonce <xref target="RFC3540"/> is
		     an optional addition to ECN that is used to protects the TCP sender against
		     accidental or malicious concealment of marked or dropped packets. With ECN-Nonce
		     a nonce sum is maintain that counts the occurrence of ECT(1) packets.

       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

	<t>We use the following terminology from <xref target="RFC3168"/> and <xref target="RFC3540"/>:</t>

   <section title="Negotiation of Accurate ECN feedback" anchor="TCPSYN">
	   <t>As there is only limited space in the TCP Options, particularly during the initial 
		   three-way handshake, an abbreviated Option is used to negotiate for Accurate ECN 
		   feedback. This option also initiates all counters to an initial value of zero at 
		   the receiving side.</t>

		   This abbreviated option is only valid in a &lt;SYN&gt; or &lt;SYN,ACK&gt; segment, during
		   a three way handshake. The negotiation follows the same procedure as with other TCP options,
		   i.e. SACK. 
		   A TCP sender MAY send the accurate ECN feedback negotiation option in an initial
		   SYN segment and MAY send a more accurate ECN option (see <xref target="Option"/>) in other segments
		   only if it received this option negotiation in the initial &lt;SYN&gt; segment or &lt;SYN,ACK&gt; 
		   for the connection. A TCP receiver MAY send an &lt;SYN,ACK&gt; segment with the accurate ECN feedback
		   negotiation option  in response to a received accurate ECN feedback negotiation option in the
		   &lt;SYN&gt;.
		   If both ends indicate that they support Accurate ECN feedback, the option
		   MUST be used in any subsequent TCP segment.

	   <section title="Accurate ECN feedback Option Specification" anchor="Option">
	   <t> A TCP receiver, that provides accurate ECN feedback, will maintain a counter for the number of ECT(0), ECT(1), CE, non-ECT marked and lost packets. The TCP option to provide the accurate ECN feedback to the sender will echo these counters (modulo 16) in five 2 byte fields. This option should be included in every ACK (and not only when a counter value changes) to ensure the reception of the ECN feedback at the sender in case of ACK loss.

	<t>
		The number of lost packet would be needed to calculate 
		the ECN Nonce sum more exactly. TCP provides anyway a mechanism to detect loss and lost 
		needs to be assumes as a string signal for congestion anyway. Thus a TCP congestion control 
		algorithm muss react on loss. Moreover, if TCP SACK is not available the exact number of lost packets
		is not known.
	</t>
	
	<t>
		The same feedback information are proposed for the (ECN) feedback in RTP 
		(see <xref target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-ecn-for-rtp"/>.
	</t>
	
	<t>
		As TCP is a bitdirectional protocol this option can be used in both directions.
