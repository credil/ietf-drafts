Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


1.  Introduction

   JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a compact format for representing content
   secured with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes
   (MACs) intended for space constrained environments such as HTTP
   Authorization headers and URI query parameters.  It represents this
   content using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] data
   structures.  The JWS cryptographic mechanisms provide integrity
   protection for arbitrary sequences of bytes.

   Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this
   specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)
   [JWA] specification.  Related encryption capabilities are described
   in the separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specification.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   JSON Web Signature (JWS)  A data structure cryptographically securing
      a JWS Header and a JWS Payload with a JWS Signature value.

   JWS Header  A string representing a JSON object that describes the
      digital signature or MAC operation applied to create the JWS
      Signature value.

   JWS Payload  The bytes to be secured - a.k.a., the message.  The
      payload can contain an arbitrary sequence of bytes.

   JWS Signature  A byte array containing the cryptographic material
      that secures the JWS Header and the JWS Payload.

   Encoded JWS Header  Base64url encoding of the bytes of the UTF-8
      [RFC3629] representation of the JWS Header.

   Encoded JWS Payload  Base64url encoding of the JWS Payload.

   Encoded JWS Signature  Base64url encoding of the JWS Signature.

Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


   JWS Secured Input  The concatenation of the Encoded JWS Header, a
      period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWS Payload.

   Header Parameter Name  The name of a member of the JSON object
      representing a JWS Header.

   Header Parameter Value  The value of a member of the JSON object
      representing a JWS Header.

   JWS Compact Serialization  A representation of the JWS as the
      concatenation of the Encoded JWS Header, the Encoded JWS Payload,
      and the Encoded JWS Signature in that order, with the three
      strings being separated by period ('.') characters.

   Base64url Encoding  For the purposes of this specification, this term
      always refers to the URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding
      described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], Section 5, with the (non URL-
      safe) '=' padding characters omitted, as permitted by Section 3.2.
      (See Appendix C for notes on implementing base64url encoding
      without padding.)

   Collision Resistant Namespace  A namespace that allows names to be
      allocated in a manner such that they are highly unlikely to
      collide with other names.  For instance, collision resistance can
      be achieved through administrative delegation of portions of the
      namespace or through use of collision-resistant name allocation
      functions.  Examples of Collision Resistant Namespaces include:
      Domain Names, Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined in the ITU-T
      X.660 and X.670 Recommendation series, and Universally Unique
      IDentifiers (UUIDs) [RFC4122].  When using an administratively
      delegated namespace, the definer of a name needs to take
      reasonable precautions to ensure they are in control of the
      portion of the namespace they use to define the name.

   StringOrURI  A JSON string value, with the additional requirement
      that while arbitrary string values MAY be used, any value
      containing a ":" character MUST be a URI [RFC3986].


3.  JSON Web Signature (JWS) Overview

   JWS represents digitally signed or MACed content using JSON data
   structures and base64url encoding.  The representation consists of
   three parts: the JWS Header, the JWS Payload, and the JWS Signature.
   In the Compact Serialization, the three parts are base64url-encoded
   for transmission, and represented as the concatenation of the encoded
   strings in that order, with the three strings being separated by
   period ('.') characters.  (A JSON Serialization for this information

Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


   is defined in the separate JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization
   (JWS-JS) [JWS-JS] specification.)

   The JWS Header describes the signature or MAC method and parameters
   employed.  The JWS Payload is the message content to be secured.  The
   JWS Signature ensures the integrity of both the JWS Header and the
   JWS Payload.

3.1.  Example JWS

   The following example JWS Header declares that the encoded object is
   a JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT] and the JWS Header and the JWS Payload
   are secured using the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm:
   {"typ":"JWT",
    "alg":"HS256"}

   Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWS
   Header yields this Encoded JWS Header value:
   eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLA0KICJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9

   The following is an example of a JSON object that can be used as a
   JWS Payload.  (Note that the payload can be any content, and need not
   be a representation of a JSON object.)
   {"iss":"joe",
    "exp":1300819380,
    "http://example.com/is_root":true}

   Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JSON
   object yields the following Encoded JWS Payload (with line breaks for
   display purposes only):

   cGxlLmNvbS9pc19yb290Ijp0cnVlfQ

   Computing the HMAC of the bytes of the ASCII [USASCII] representation
   of the JWS Secured Input (the concatenation of the Encoded JWS
   Header, a period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWS Payload) with
   the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm using the key specified in Appendix A.1
   and base64url encoding the result yields this Encoded JWS Signature
   value:
   dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk

   Concatenating these parts in the order Header.Payload.Signature with
   period characters between the parts yields this complete JWS
   representation (with line breaks for display purposes only):

   This computation is illustrated in more detail in Appendix A.1.


4.  JWS Header

   The members of the JSON object represented by the JWS Header describe
   the digital signature or MAC applied to the Encoded JWS Header and
   the Encoded JWS Payload and optionally additional properties of the
   JWS.  The Header Parameter Names within this object MUST be unique;
   JWSs with duplicate Header Parameter Names MUST be rejected.
   Implementations MUST understand the entire contents of the header;
   otherwise, the JWS MUST be rejected.

   There are three classes of Header Parameter Names: Reserved Header
   Parameter Names, Public Header Parameter Names, and Private Header
   Parameter Names.

4.1.  Reserved Header Parameter Names

   The following header parameter names are reserved with meanings as
   defined below.  All the names are short because a core goal of JWSs
   is for the representations to be compact.

   Additional reserved header parameter names MAY be defined via the
   IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters registry
   Section 7.1.  As indicated by the common registry, JWSs and JWEs
   share a common header parameter space; when a parameter is used by
   both specifications, its usage must be compatible between the
   specifications.

4.1.1.  "alg" (Algorithm) Header Parameter

   The "alg" (algorithm) header parameter identifies the cryptographic
   algorithm used to secure the JWS.  The algorithm specified by the
   "alg" value MUST be supported by the implementation and there MUST be
   a key for use with that algorithm associated with the party that
   digitally signed or MACed the content or the JWS MUST be rejected.
   The "alg" value is case sensitive.  Its value MUST be a string
   containing a StringOrURI value.  This header parameter is REQUIRED.

   A list of defined "alg" values for use with JWS is presented in

Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


   Section 3.1 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification.
   "alg" values SHOULD either be registered in the IANA JSON Web
   Signature and Encryption Algorithms registry [JWA] or be a URI that
   contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.

4.1.2.  "jku" (JWK Set URL) Header Parameter

   The "jku" (JWK Set URL) header parameter is a URI [RFC3986] that
   refers to a resource for a set of JSON-encoded public keys, one of
   which corresponds to the key used to digitally sign the JWS.  The
   keys MUST be encoded as a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) [JWK].  The
   protocol used to acquire the resource MUST provide integrity
   protection; an HTTP GET request to retrieve the certificate MUST use
   TLS [RFC2818] [RFC5246]; the identity of the server MUST be
   validated, as per Section 3.1 of HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818].  This
   header parameter is OPTIONAL.

4.1.3.  "jwk" (JSON Web Key) Header Parameter

   The "jwk" (JSON Web Key) header parameter is a public key that
   corresponds to the key used to digitally sign the JWS.  This key is
   represented as a JSON Web Key [JWK].  This header parameter is
   OPTIONAL.

4.1.4.  "x5u" (X.509 URL) Header Parameter

   The "x5u" (X.509 URL) header parameter is a URI [RFC3986] that refers
   to a resource for the X.509 public key certificate or certificate
   chain [RFC5280] corresponding to the key used to digitally sign the
   JWS.  The identified resource MUST provide a representation of the
   certificate or certificate chain that conforms to RFC 5280 [RFC5280]
   in PEM encoded form [RFC1421].  The certificate containing the public
   key of the entity that digitally signed the JWS MUST be the first
   certificate.  This MAY be followed by additional certificates, with
   each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the
   previous one.  The protocol used to acquire the resource MUST provide
   integrity protection; an HTTP GET request to retrieve the certificate
   MUST use TLS [RFC2818] [RFC5246]; the identity of the server MUST be
   validated, as per Section 3.1 of HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818].  This
   header parameter is OPTIONAL.

4.1.5.  "x5t" (X.509 Certificate Thumbprint) Header Parameter

   The "x5t" (X.509 Certificate Thumbprint) header parameter provides a
   base64url encoded SHA-1 thumbprint (a.k.a. digest) of the DER
   encoding of the X.509 certificate [RFC5280] corresponding to the key
   used to digitally sign the JWS.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL.

Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


   If, in the future, certificate thumbprints need to be computed using
   hash functions other than SHA-1, it is suggested that additional
   related header parameters be defined for that purpose.  For example,
   it is suggested that a new "x5t#S256" (X.509 Certificate Thumbprint
   using SHA-256) header parameter could be defined by registering it in
   the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters registry
   Section 7.1.

4.1.6.  "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Header Parameter

   The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) header parameter contains the
   X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain [RFC5280]
   corresponding to the key used to digitally sign the JWS.  The
   certificate or certificate chain is represented as an array of
   certificate values.  Each value is a base64 encoded ([RFC4648]
   Section 4 - not base64url encoded) DER [ITU.X690.1994] PKIX
   certificate value.  The certificate containing the public key of the
   entity that digitally signed the JWS MUST be the first certificate.
   This MAY be followed by additional certificates, with each subsequent
   certificate being the one used to certify the previous one.  The
   recipient MUST verify the certificate chain according to [RFC5280]
   and reject the JWS if any validation failure occurs.  This header
   parameter is OPTIONAL.

   See Appendix B for an example "x5c" value.

4.1.7.  "kid" (Key ID) Header Parameter

   The "kid" (key ID) header parameter is a hint indicating which key
   was used to secure the JWS.  This parameter allows originators to
   explicitly signal a change of key to recipients.  Should the
   recipient be unable to locate a key corresponding to the "kid" value,
   they SHOULD treat that condition as an error.  The interpretation of
   the "kid" value is unspecified.  Its value MUST be a string.  This
   header parameter is OPTIONAL.

   When used with a JWK, the "kid" value MAY be used to match a JWK
   "kid" parameter value.

4.1.8.  "typ" (Type) Header Parameter

   The "typ" (type) header parameter is used to declare the type of this
   object.  The type value "JWS" MAY be used to indicate that this
   object is a JWS.  The "typ" value is case sensitive.  Its value MUST
   be a string.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL.

   MIME Media Type [RFC2046] values MAY be used as "typ" values.

   "typ" values SHOULD either be registered in the IANA JSON Web
   Signature and Encryption Type Values registry Section 7.2 or be a URI
   that contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.

4.1.9.  "cty" (Content Type) Header Parameter

   The "cty" (content type) header parameter is used to declare the type
   of the secured content (the Payload).  The "cty" value is case
   sensitive.  Its value MUST be a string.  This header parameter is
   OPTIONAL.

   The values used for the "cty" header parameter come from the same
   value space as the "typ" header parameter, with the same rules
   applying.

4.2.  Public Header Parameter Names

   Additional header parameter names can be defined by those using JWSs.
   However, in order to prevent collisions, any new header parameter
   name SHOULD either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Signature and
   Encryption Header Parameters registry Section 7.1 or be a URI that
   contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.  In each case, the definer
   of the name or value needs to take reasonable precautions to make
   sure they are in control of the part of the namespace they use to
   define the header parameter name.

   New header parameters should be introduced sparingly, as they can
   result in non-interoperable JWSs.

4.3.  Private Header Parameter Names

   A producer and consumer of a JWS may agree to any header parameter
   name that is not a Reserved Name Section 4.1 or a Public Name
   Section 4.2.  Unlike Public Names, these private names are subject to
   collision and should be used with caution.


5.  Rules for Creating and Validating a JWS

   To create a JWS, one MUST perform these steps.  The order of the
   steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies
   between the inputs and outputs of the steps.

   1.  Create the content to be used as the JWS Payload.

   2.  Base64url encode the bytes of the JWS Payload.  This encoding
       becomes the Encoded JWS Payload.




Jones, et al.            Expires January 7, 2013               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


   3.  Create a JWS Header containing the desired set of header
       parameters.  Note that white space is explicitly allowed in the
       representation and no canonicalization need be performed before
       encoding.

   4.  Base64url encode the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWS
       Header to create the Encoded JWS Header.

   5.  Compute the JWS Signature in the manner defined for the
       particular algorithm being used.  The JWS Secured Input is always
       the concatenation of the Encoded JWS Header, a period ('.')
       character, and the Encoded JWS Payload.  The "alg" (algorithm)
       header parameter MUST be present in the JSON Header, with the
       algorithm value accurately representing the algorithm used to
       construct the JWS Signature.

   6.  Base64url encode the representation of the JWS Signature to
       create the Encoded JWS Signature.

   7.  The three encoded parts, taken together, are the result.  The
       Compact Serialization of this result is the concatenation of the
       Encoded JWS Header, the Encoded JWS Payload, and the Encoded JWS
       Signature in that order, with the three strings being separated
       by period ('.') characters.

   When validating a JWS, the following steps MUST be taken.  The order
   of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no
   dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.  If any of
   the listed steps fails, then the JWS MUST be rejected.

   1.  Parse the three parts of the input (which are separated by period
       characters when using the JWS Compact Serialization) into the
       Encoded JWS Header, the Encoded JWS Payload, and the Encoded JWS
       Signature.

   2.  The Encoded JWS Header MUST be successfully base64url decoded
       following the restriction given in this specification that no
       padding characters have been used.

   3.  The resulting JWS Header MUST be completely valid JSON syntax
       conforming to RFC 4627 [RFC4627].

   4.  The resulting JWS Header MUST be validated to only include
       parameters and values whose syntax and semantics are both
       understood and supported.

   5.  The Encoded JWS Payload MUST be successfully base64url decoded
       following the restriction given in this specification that no



Jones, et al.            Expires January 7, 2013               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


       padding characters have been used.

   6.  The Encoded JWS Signature MUST be successfully base64url decoded
       following the restriction given in this specification that no
       padding characters have been used.

   7.  The JWS Signature MUST be successfully validated against the JWS
       Secured Input (the concatenation of the Encoded JWS Header, a
       period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWS Payload) in the
       manner defined for the algorithm being used, which MUST be
       accurately represented by the value of the "alg" (algorithm)
       header parameter, which MUST be present.

   Processing a JWS inevitably requires comparing known strings to
   values in the header.  For example, in checking what the algorithm
   is, the Unicode string encoding "alg" will be checked against the
   member names in the JWS Header to see if there is a matching header
   parameter name.  A similar process occurs when determining if the
   value of the "alg" header parameter represents a supported algorithm.

   Comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings MUST be
   performed as specified below:

   1.  Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of Unicode
       code points.

   2.  Unicode Normalization [USA15] MUST NOT be applied at any point to
       either the JSON string or to the string it is to be compared
       against.

   3.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
       Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.


6.  Securing JWSs with Cryptographic Algorithms

   JWS uses cryptographic algorithms to digitally sign or MAC the JWS
   Header and the JWS Payload.  The JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specification describes a set of cryptographic algorithms and
   identifiers to be used with this specification.  Specifically,
   Section 3.1 specifies a set of "alg" (algorithm) header parameter
   values intended for use this specification.  It also describes the
   semantics and operations that are specific to these algorithms and
   algorithm families.

   Public keys employed for digital signing can be identified using the
   Header Parameter methods described in Section 4.1 or can be
   distributed using methods that are outside the scope of this

   specification.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
   established by this specification.

   Values are registered with a Specification Required [RFC5226] after a
   two week review period on the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list, on the
   advice of one or more Designated Experts.  However, to allow for the
   allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Expert(s)
   may approve registration once they are satisfied that such a
   specification will be published.

   Registration requests must be sent to the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list
   for review and comment, with an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request
   for access token type: example"). [[ Note to RFC-EDITOR: The name of
   the mailing list should be determined in consultation with the IESG
   and IANA.  Suggested name: jose-reg-review. ]]

   Within the review period, the Designated Expert(s) will either
   approve or deny the registration request, communicating this decision
   to the review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation
   and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request
   successful.

   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Expert(s),
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

7.1.  JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA JSON Web Signature and
   Encryption Header Parameters registry for reserved JWS and JWE header
   parameter names.  The registry records the reserved header parameter
   name and a reference to the specification that defines it.  The same
   Header Parameter Name may be registered multiple times, provided that
   the parameter usage is compatible between the specifications.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Cryptographic Security Considerations

   All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
   must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
   protecting the user's private key, preventing various attacks, and
   helping the user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently encrypting a
   message for the wrong recipient.  The entire list of security
   considerations is beyond the scope of this document, but some
   significant concerns are listed here.

   All the security considerations in XML DSIG 2.0
   [W3C.CR-xmldsig-core2-20120124], also apply to this specification,
   other than those that are XML specific.  Likewise, many of the best
   practices documented in XML Signature Best Practices
   [W3C.WD-xmldsig-bestpractices-20110809] also apply to this
   specification, other than those that are XML specific.

   Keys are only as strong as the amount of entropy used to generate
   them.  A minimum of 128 bits of entropy should be used for all keys,
   and depending upon the application context, more may be required.

   When utilizing TLS to retrieve information, the authority providing
   the resource MUST be authenticated and the information retrieved MUST
   be free from modification.




Jones, et al.            Expires January 7, 2013               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


   When cryptographic algorithms are implemented in such a way that
   successful operations take a different amount of time than
   unsuccessful operations, attackers may be able to use the time
   difference to obtain information about the keys employed.  Therefore,
   such timing differences must be avoided.

   TBD: Write security considerations about the implications of using a
   SHA-1 hash (for compatibility reasons) for the "x5t" (x.509
   certificate thumbprint).

   TBD: We need a section on generating randomness in browsers; it's
   easy to screw up.

8.2.  JSON Security Considerations

   TBD: We need to look into any issues relating to security and JSON
   parsing.  One wonders just how secure most JSON parsing libraries
   are.  Were they ever hardened for security scenarios?  If not, what
   kind of holes does that open up?  We need to put in text about why
   strict JSON validation is necessary - basically, that if malformed
   JSON is received then the intent of the sender is impossible to
   reliably discern.

8.3.  Unicode Comparison Security Considerations

   Header parameter names and algorithm names are Unicode strings.  For
   security reasons, the representations of these names must be compared
   verbatim after performing any escape processing (as per RFC 4627
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5).  This means, for instance, that these JSON
   strings must compare as being equal ("sig", "\u0073ig"), whereas
   these must all compare as being not equal to the first set or to each
   other ("SIG", "Sig", "si\u0047").

   JSON strings MAY contain characters outside the Unicode Basic
   Multilingual Plane.  For instance, the G clef character (U+1D11E) may
   be represented in a JSON string as "\uD834\uDD1E".  Ideally, JWS
   implementations SHOULD ensure that characters outside the Basic
   Multilingual Plane are preserved and compared correctly;
   alternatively, if this is not possible due to these characters
   exercising limitations present in the underlying JSON implementation,
   then input containing them MUST be rejected.


9.  Open Issues

   [[ to be removed by the RFC editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   The following items remain to be considered or done in this draft:

   o  Should we define an optional nonce and/or timestamp header
      parameter?  (Use of a nonce is an effective countermeasure to some
      kinds of attacks.)

   o  Finish the Security Considerations section.

   all represent JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [JWT], the payload can be any
   base64url encoded content.

A.1.  JWS using HMAC SHA-256

A.1.1.  Encoding

   The following example JWS Header declares that the data structure is
   a JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT] and the JWS Secured Input is secured
   using the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm.
   {"typ":"JWT",
    "alg":"HS256"}

   The following byte array contains the UTF-8 representation of the JWS
   Header:

   [123, 34, 116, 121, 112, 34, 58, 34, 74, 87, 84, 34, 44, 13, 10, 32,
   34, 97, 108, 103, 34, 58, 34, 72, 83, 50, 53, 54, 34, 125]

   Base64url encoding these bytes yields this Encoded JWS Header value:

   The JWS Payload used in this example is the bytes of the UTF-8
   representation of the JSON object below.  (Note that the payload can
   be any base64url encoded sequence of bytes, and need not be a
   base64url encoded JSON object.)
   {"iss":"joe",
    "exp":1300819380,
    "http://example.com/is_root":true}

   The following byte array, which is the UTF-8 representation of the
   JSON object above, is the JWS Payload:

   111, 116, 34, 58, 116, 114, 117, 101, 125]

   Base64url encoding the above yields the Encoded JWS Payload value
   (with line breaks for display purposes only):

   Concatenating the Encoded JWS Header, a period character, and the
   Encoded JWS Payload yields this JWS Secured Input value (with line
   breaks for display purposes only):

   The ASCII representation of the JWS Secured Input is the following
   byte array:

   [101, 121, 74, 48, 101, 88, 65, 105, 79, 105, 74, 75, 86, 49, 81,
   105, 76, 65, 48, 75, 73, 67, 74, 104, 98, 71, 99, 105, 79, 105, 74,
   73, 85, 122, 73, 49, 78, 105, 74, 57, 46, 101, 121, 74, 112, 99, 51,

   74, 108, 101, 72, 65, 105, 79, 106, 69, 122, 77, 68, 65, 52, 77, 84,
   107, 122, 79, 68, 65, 115, 68, 81, 111, 103, 73, 109, 104, 48, 100,
   72, 65, 54, 76, 121, 57, 108, 101, 71, 70, 116, 99, 71, 120, 108, 76,

   106, 112, 48, 99, 110, 86, 108, 102, 81]

   HMACs are generated using keys.  This example uses the key
   represented by the following byte array:

   [3, 35, 53, 75, 43, 15, 165, 188, 131, 126, 6, 101, 119, 123, 166,
   143, 90, 179, 40, 230, 240, 84, 201, 40, 169, 15, 132, 178, 210, 80,
   46, 191, 211, 251, 90, 146, 210, 6, 71, 239, 150, 138, 180, 195, 119,
   98, 61, 34, 61, 46, 33, 114, 5, 46, 79, 8, 192, 205, 154, 245, 103,
   208, 128, 163]

   Running the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm on the bytes of the ASCII
   representation of the JWS Secured Input with this key yields the
   following byte array:

   [116, 24, 223, 180, 151, 153, 224, 37, 79, 250, 96, 125, 216, 173,
   187, 186, 22, 212, 37, 77, 105, 214, 191, 240, 91, 88, 5, 88, 83,

   Base64url encoding the above HMAC output yields the Encoded JWS
   Signature value:
   dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk

A.1.2.  Decoding

   Decoding the JWS requires base64url decoding the Encoded JWS Header,
   Encoded JWS Payload, and Encoded JWS Signature to produce the JWS
   Header, JWS Payload, and JWS Signature byte arrays.  The byte array
   containing the UTF-8 representation of the JWS Header is decoded into
   the JWS Header string.

A.1.3.  Validating

   Next we validate the decoded results.  Since the "alg" parameter in
   the header is "HS256", we validate the HMAC SHA-256 value contained
   in the JWS Signature.  If any of the validation steps fail, the JWS
   MUST be rejected.

   First, we validate that the JWS Header string is legal JSON.

   To validate the HMAC value, we repeat the previous process of using
   the correct key and the ASCII representation of the JWS Secured Input
   as input to the HMAC SHA-256 function and then taking the output and
   determining if it matches the JWS Signature.  If it matches exactly,
   the HMAC has been validated.

A.2.  JWS using RSA SHA-256

A.2.1.  Encoding

   The JWS Header in this example is different from the previous example
   in two ways: First, because a different algorithm is being used, the
   "alg" value is different.  Second, for illustration purposes only,
   the optional "typ" parameter is not used.  (This difference is not
   related to the algorithm employed.)  The JWS Header used is:
   {"alg":"RS256"}

   The following byte array contains the UTF-8 representation of the JWS
   Header:

   [123, 34, 97, 108, 103, 34, 58, 34, 82, 83, 50, 53, 54, 34, 125]

   Base64url encoding these bytes yields this Encoded JWS Header value:
   eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9

   The JWS Payload used in this example, which follows, is the same as
   in the previous example.  Since the Encoded JWS Payload will

   therefore be the same, its computation is not repeated here.
   {"iss":"joe",
    "exp":1300819380,
    "http://example.com/is_root":true}

   Concatenating the Encoded JWS Header, a period character, and the
   Encoded JWS Payload yields this JWS Secured Input value (with line
   breaks for display purposes only):

   The ASCII representation of the JWS Secured Input is the following
   byte array:

   [101, 121, 74, 104, 98, 71, 99, 105, 79, 105, 74, 83, 85, 122, 73,
   49, 78, 105, 74, 57, 46, 101, 121, 74, 112, 99, 51, 77, 105, 79, 105,
   74, 113, 98, 50, 85, 105, 76, 65, 48, 75, 73, 67, 74, 108, 101, 72,
   65, 105, 79, 106, 69, 122, 77, 68, 65, 52, 77, 84, 107, 122, 79, 68,
   65, 115, 68, 81, 111, 103, 73, 109, 104, 48, 100, 72, 65, 54, 76,
   121, 57, 108, 101, 71, 70, 116, 99, 71, 120, 108, 76, 109, 78, 118,
   98, 83, 57, 112, 99, 49, 57, 121, 98, 50, 57, 48, 73, 106, 112, 48,
   99, 110, 86, 108, 102, 81]

   The RSA key consists of a public part (Modulus, Exponent), and a
   Private Exponent.  The values of the RSA key used in this example,
   presented as the byte arrays representing big endian integers are:

   The RSA private key (Modulus, Private Exponent) is then passed to the
   RSA signing function, which also takes the hash type, SHA-256, and
   the bytes of the ASCII representation of the JWS Secured Input as
   inputs.  The result of the digital signature is a byte array, which
   represents a big endian integer.  In this example, it is:

A.2.2.  Decoding

   Decoding the JWS requires base64url decoding the Encoded JWS Header,
   Encoded JWS Payload, and Encoded JWS Signature to produce the JWS
   Header, JWS Payload, and JWS Signature byte arrays.  The byte array
   containing the UTF-8 representation of the JWS Header is decoded into
   the JWS Header string.

A.2.3.  Validating

   Since the "alg" parameter in the header is "RS256", we validate the
   RSA SHA-256 digital signature contained in the JWS Signature.  If any
   of the validation steps fail, the JWS MUST be rejected.

   First, we validate that the JWS Header string is legal JSON.

   Validating the JWS Signature is a little different from the previous
   example.  First, we base64url decode the Encoded JWS Signature to
   produce a digital signature S to check.  We then pass (n, e), S and
   the bytes of the ASCII representation of the JWS Secured Input to an
   RSA signature verifier that has been configured to use the SHA-256
   hash function.

A.3.  JWS using ECDSA P-256 SHA-256

A.3.1.  Encoding

   The JWS Header for this example differs from the previous example
   because a different algorithm is being used.  The JWS Header used is:
   {"alg":"ES256"}

   The following byte array contains the UTF-8 representation of the JWS
   Header:

   [123, 34, 97, 108, 103, 34, 58, 34, 69, 83, 50, 53, 54, 34, 125]

   Base64url encoding these bytes yields this Encoded JWS Header value:

   The JWS Payload used in this example, which follows, is the same as
   in the previous examples.  Since the Encoded JWS Payload will
   therefore be the same, its computation is not repeated here.
   {"iss":"joe",
    "exp":1300819380,
    "http://example.com/is_root":true}

   Concatenating the Encoded JWS Header, a period character, and the
   Encoded JWS Payload yields this JWS Secured Input value (with line
   breaks for display purposes only):

   The ECDSA private part d is then passed to an ECDSA signing function,
   which also takes the curve type, P-256, the hash type, SHA-256, and
   the bytes of the ASCII representation of the JWS Secured Input as

   Concatenating the S array to the end of the R array and base64url
   encoding the result produces this value for the Encoded JWS Signature

A.3.2.  Decoding

   Decoding the JWS requires base64url decoding the Encoded JWS Header,
   Encoded JWS Payload, and Encoded JWS Signature to produce the JWS
   Header, JWS Payload, and JWS Signature byte arrays.  The byte array
   containing the UTF-8 representation of the JWS Header is decoded into
   the JWS Header string.

A.3.3.  Validating

   Since the "alg" parameter in the header is "ES256", we validate the
   ECDSA P-256 SHA-256 digital signature contained in the JWS Signature.
   If any of the validation steps fail, the JWS MUST be rejected.

   First, we validate that the JWS Header string is legal JSON.

   Validating the JWS Signature is a little different from the first
   example.  First, we base64url decode the Encoded JWS Signature as in
   the previous examples but we then need to split the 64 member byte
   array that must result into two 32 byte arrays, the first R and the
   second S. We then pass (x, y), (R, S) and the bytes of the ASCII
   representation of the JWS Secured Input to an ECDSA signature
   verifier that has been configured to use the P-256 curve with the

   SHA-256 hash function.

   As explained in Section 3.4 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specification, the use of the K value in ECDSA means that we cannot
   validate the correctness of the digital signature in the same way we
   validated the correctness of the HMAC.  Instead, implementations MUST
   use an ECDSA validator to validate the digital signature.

A.4.  JWS using ECDSA P-521 SHA-512

A.4.1.  Encoding

   The JWS Header for this example differs from the previous example
   because a different ECDSA curve and hash function are used.  The JWS
   Header used is:
   {"alg":"ES512"}

   The following byte array contains the UTF-8 representation of the JWS
   Header:

   [123, 34, 97, 108, 103, 34, 58, 34, 69, 83, 53, 49, 50, 34, 125]

   Base64url encoding these bytes yields this Encoded JWS Header value:
   eyJhbGciOiJFUzUxMiJ9

   The JWS Payload used in this example, is the ASCII string "Payload".
   The representation of this string is the byte array:

   [80, 97, 121, 108, 111, 97, 100]

   Base64url encoding these bytes yields the Encoded JWS Payload value:
   UGF5bG9hZA

   Concatenating the Encoded JWS Header, a period character, and the
   Encoded JWS Payload yields this JWS Secured Input value:
   eyJhbGciOiJFUzUxMiJ9.UGF5bG9hZA

   The ASCII representation of the JWS Secured Input is the following
   byte array:

   [101, 121, 74, 104, 98, 71, 99, 105, 79, 105, 74, 70, 85, 122, 85,

   The ECDSA key consists of a public part, the EC point (x, y), and a
   private part d.  The values of the ECDSA key used in this example,
   presented as the byte arrays representing three 521 bit big endian
   integers are:

   Concatenating the S array to the end of the R array and base64url
   encoding the result produces this value for the Encoded JWS Signature
   (with line breaks for display purposes only):

A.4.2.  Decoding

   Decoding the JWS requires base64url decoding the Encoded JWS Header,
   Encoded JWS Payload, and Encoded JWS Signature to produce the JWS
   Header, JWS Payload, and JWS Signature byte arrays.  The byte array
   containing the UTF-8 representation of the JWS Header is decoded into
   the JWS Header string.

A.4.3.  Validating

   Since the "alg" parameter in the header is "ES512", we validate the
   ECDSA P-521 SHA-512 digital signature contained in the JWS Signature.
   If any of the validation steps fail, the JWS MUST be rejected.

   First, we validate that the JWS Header string is legal JSON.

   Validating the JWS Signature is similar to the previous example.
   First, we base64url decode the Encoded JWS Signature as in the
   previous examples but we then need to split the 132 member byte array
   that must result into two 66 byte arrays, the first R and the second
   S. We then pass (x, y), (R, S) and the bytes of the ASCII
   representation of the JWS Secured Input to an ECDSA signature
   verifier that has been configured to use the P-521 curve with the
   SHA-512 hash function.

   As explained in Section 3.4 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specification, the use of the K value in ECDSA means that we cannot
   validate the correctness of the digital signature in the same way we
   validated the correctness of the HMAC.  Instead, implementations MUST
   use an ECDSA validator to validate the digital signature.

A.5.  Example Plaintext JWS

   The following example JWS Header declares that the encoded object is
   a Plaintext JWS:
   {"alg":"none"}

   Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWS
   Header yields this Encoded JWS Header:

Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


   The JWS Payload used in this example, which follows, is the same as
   in the previous examples.  Since the Encoded JWS Payload will
   therefore be the same, its computation is not repeated here.
   {"iss":"joe",
    "exp":1300819380,
    "http://example.com/is_root":true}

   The Encoded JWS Signature is the empty string.

   Concatenating these parts in the order Header.Payload.Signature with
   period characters between the parts yields this complete JWS (with
   line breaks for display purposes only):

Appendix C.  Notes on implementing base64url encoding without padding

   This appendix describes how to implement base64url encoding and
   decoding functions without padding based upon standard base64
   encoding and decoding functions that do use padding.

   To be concrete, example C# code implementing these functions is shown
   below.  Similar code could be used in other languages.
   static string base64urlencode(byte [] arg)
   {
     string s = Convert.ToBase64String(arg); // Standard base64 encoder
     s = s.Split('=')[0]; // Remove any trailing '='s
     s = s.Replace('+', '-'); // 62nd char of encoding
     s = s.Replace('/', '_'); // 63rd char of encoding
     return s;
   }

   static byte [] base64urldecode(string arg)
   {
     string s = arg;
     s = s.Replace('-', '+'); // 62nd char of encoding
     s = s.Replace('_', '/'); // 63rd char of encoding
     switch (s.Length % 4) // Pad with trailing '='s
     {
       case 0: break; // No pad chars in this case
       case 2: s += "=="; break; // Two pad chars
       case 3: s += "="; break; // One pad char
       default: throw new System.Exception(
         "Illegal base64url string!");
     }
     return Convert.FromBase64String(s); // Standard base64 decoder
   }

   As per the example code above, the number of '=' padding characters
   that needs to be added to the end of a base64url encoded string
   without padding to turn it into one with padding is a deterministic
   function of the length of the encoded string.  Specifically, if the
   length mod 4 is 0, no padding is added; if the length mod 4 is 2, two
   '=' padding characters are added; if the length mod 4 is 3, one '='
   padding character is added; if the length mod 4 is 1, the input is
   malformed.

   which when decoded, reproduces the byte sequence.

Appendix D.  Acknowledgements

   Solutions for signing JSON content were previously explored by Magic
   Signatures [MagicSignatures], JSON Simple Sign [JSS], and Canvas
   Applications [CanvasApp], all of which influenced this draft.  Dirk
   Balfanz, Yaron Y. Goland, John Panzer, and Paul Tarjan all made
   significant contributions to the design of this specification.

   My thanks to Axel Nennker for his early implementation and feedback
   on the JWS and JWE specifications.


Appendix E.  Document History

   [[ to be removed by the RFC editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   -03

   o  Added the "cty" (content type) header parameter for declaring type
      information about the secured content, as opposed to the "typ"
      (type) header parameter, which declares type information about
      this object.

   o  Added "Collision Resistant Namespace" to the terminology section.

   o  Reference ITU.X690.1994 for DER encoding.

   o  Added an example JWS using ECDSA P-521 SHA-512.  This has
      particular illustrative value because of the use of the 521 bit
      integers in the key and signature values.  This is also an example
      in which the payload is not a base64url encoded JSON object.

   o  Added an example "x5c" value.

   o  No longer say "the UTF-8 representation of the JWS Secured Input
      (which is the same as the ASCII representation)".  Just call it
      "the ASCII representation of the JWS Secured Input".

   o  Added Registration Template sections for defined registries.

Internet-Draft          JSON Web Signature (JWS)               July 2012


   o  Added Registry Contents sections to populate registry values.

   o  Changed name of the JSON Web Signature and Encryption "typ" Values
      registry to be the JSON Web Signature and Encryption Type Values
      registry, since it is used for more than just values of the "typ"
      parameter.

   o  Moved registries JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header
      Parameters and JSON Web Signature and Encryption Type Values to
      the JWS specification.

   o  Numerous editorial improvements.

   -02

   o  Clarified that it is an error when a "kid" value is included and
      no matching key is found.

   o  Removed assumption that "kid" (key ID) can only refer to an
      asymmetric key.

   o  Clarified that JWSs with duplicate Header Parameter Names MUST be
      rejected.

   o  Clarified the relationship between "typ" header parameter values
      and MIME types.

   o  Registered application/jws MIME type and "JWS" typ header
      parameter value.

   o  Simplified JWK terminology to get replace the "JWK Key Object" and
      "JWK Container Object" terms with simply "JSON Web Key (JWK)" and
      "JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set)" and to eliminate potential confusion
      between single keys and sets of keys.  As part of this change, the
      header parameter name for a public key value was changed from
      "jpk" (JSON Public Key) to "jwk" (JSON Web Key).

   o  Added suggestion on defining additional header parameters such as
      "x5t#S256" in the future for certificate thumbprints using hash
      algorithms other than SHA-1.

   o  Specify RFC 2818 server identity validation, rather than RFC 6125
      (paralleling the same decision in the OAuth specs).

   o  Generalized language to refer to Message Authentication Codes
      (MACs) rather than Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs)
      unless in a context specific to HMAC algorithms.

   o  Reformatted to give each header parameter its own section heading.

   -01

   o  Moved definition of Plaintext JWSs (using "alg":"none") here from
      the JWT specification since this functionality is likely to be
      useful in more contexts that just for JWTs.

   o  Added "jpk" and "x5c" header parameters for including JWK public
      keys and X.509 certificate chains directly in the header.

   o  Clarified that this specification is defining the JWS Compact
      Serialization.  Referenced the new JWS-JS spec, which defines the
      JWS JSON Serialization.

   o  Added text "New header parameters should be introduced sparingly
      since an implementation that does not understand a parameter MUST
      reject the JWS".

   o  Clarified that the order of the creation and validation steps is
      not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between
      the inputs and outputs of the steps.

   o  Changed "no canonicalization is performed" to "no canonicalization
      need be performed".

   o  Corrected the Magic Signatures reference.

   o  Made other editorial improvements suggested by JOSE working group
      participants.

   -00

   o  Created the initial IETF draft based upon
      draft-jones-json-web-signature-04 with no normative changes.

   o  Changed terminology to no longer call both digital signatures and
      HMACs "signatures".
