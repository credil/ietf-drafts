Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8                June 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document forms part of the Email Address Internationalization
   (EAI) protocols described in the EAI Framework document [RFC6530].
   As part of the overall EAI work, email messages could be transmitted
   and delivered containing un-encoded UTF-8 characters in the header
   and/or body, and maildrops that are accessed using POP3 [RFC1939]
   might natively store UTF-8.

   This specification extends POP3 [RFC1939] using the POP3 extension
   mechanism [RFC2449] to permit un-encoded UTF-8 [RFC3629] in headers,
   and bodies (e.g., transferred using 8-bit Content Transfer Encoding)
   as described in "Internationalized Email Headers" [RFC6532].  It also
   adds a mechanism to support login names and passwords containing
   UTF-8 characters, and a mechanism to support UTF-8 characters in
   protocol level response strings as well as the ability to negotiate a
   language for such response strings.

   This specification also adds a new response code to indicate that a
   message could not be returned because it requires UTF-8 mode and the
   server is unwilling to create and deliver variant form of the message
   discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-eai-5738bis].

   This specification replaces an earlier, experimental, approach to the
   same problem RFC 5721 [RFC5721].  Section 6 of [RFC6530] describes
   the changes in approach between RFC 5721 [RFC5721] and this
   specification.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server, respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

   Note that examples always use 7-bit ASCII characters due to
   limitations of this document format; Otherwise, some examples for the
   "LANG" command may appear incorrectly as a result.

2.  LANG Capability

   Per "POP3 Extension Mechanism" [RFC2449], this document adds a new
   capability response tag to indicate support for a new command: LANG.
   The capability tag and new command are described below.

   CAPA tag:
      LANG

   Arguments with CAPA tag:
      none

   Added Commands:
      LANG

   Standard commands affected:
      All

   Announced states / possible differences:
      both / no

   Commands valid in states:
      AUTHORIZATION, TRANSACTION

   Specification reference:
      this document

   Discussion:

   POP3 allows most +OK and -ERR server responses to include human-
   readable text that, in some cases, might be presented to the user.
   But that text is limited to ASCII by the POP3 specification
   [RFC1939].  The LANG capability and command permit a POP3 client to
   negotiate which language the server uses when sending human-readable
   text.

   The LANG command requests that human-readable text included in all
   subsequent +OK and -ERR responses be localized to a language matching
   the language range argument (the "Basic Language Range" as described
   by [RFC4647]).  If the command succeeds, the server returns a +OK
   response followed by a single space, the exact language tag selected,
   another space, and the rest of the line is human-readable text in the
   appropriate language.  This and subsequent protocol-level human-
   readable text is encoded in the UTF-8 charset.

   If the command fails, the server returns an -ERR response and
   subsequent human-readable response text continues to use the language
   that was previously active.

Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8                June 2012


   The special "*" language range argument indicates a request to use a
   language designated as preferred by the server administrator.  The
   preferred language MAY vary based on the currently active user.

   If no argument is given and the POP3 server issues a positive
   response, then the response given is multi-line.  After the initial
   +OK, for each language tag the server supports, the POP3 server
   responds with a line for that language.  This line is called a
   "language listing".

   In order to simplify parsing, all POP3 servers are required to use a
   certain format for language listings.  A language listing consists of
   the language tag [RFC5646] of the message, optionally followed by a
   single space and a human-readable description of the language in the
   language itself, using the UTF-8 charset.  There are no specific
   listing order of languages, which may depend on configuration or
   implementation.

   Examples:

      < Note that some examples do not include the correct character
      accents due to limitations of this document format. >


      C: USER karen
      S: +OK Hello, karen
      C: PASS password
      S: +OK karen's maildrop contains 2 messages (320 octets)

      < Client requests deprecated MUL language.  Server replies
      with -ERR response. >

      C: LANG MUL
      S: -ERR invalid language MUL

      < A LANG command with no parameters is a request for
      a language listing. >

      C: LANG
      S: +OK Language listing follows:
      S: en English
      S: en-boont English Boontling dialect
      S: de Deutsch
      S: it Italiano
      S: es Espanol
      S: sv Svenska
      S: .

3.  UTF8 Capability

   Per "POP3 Extension Mechanism" [RFC2449], this document adds a new
   capability response tag to indicate support for new server
   functionality, including a new command: UTF8.  The capability tag and
   new command and functionality are described below.

   CAPA tag:
      UTF8

   Arguments with CAPA tag:
      USER

   Added Commands:
      UTF8

   Standard commands affected:
      USER, PASS, APOP, LIST, TOP, RETR

   Announced states / possible differences:
      both / no

Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8                June 2012


   Commands valid in states:
      AUTHORIZATION

   Specification reference:
      this document

   Discussion:

   This capability adds the "UTF8" command to POP3.  The UTF8 command
   switches the session from ASCII to UTF-8 mode.  In UTF-8 mode, both
   servers and clients can send and accept UTF-8 characters.

3.1.  The UTF8 Command

   The UTF8 command enables UTF-8 mode.  The UTF8 command has no
   parameters.

   Maildrops can natively store UTF-8 or be limited to ASCII.  UTF-8
   mode has no effect on messages in an ASCII-only maildrop.  Messages
   in native UTF-8 maildrops can be ASCII or UTF-8 using
   internationalized headers [RFC6532] and/or 8bit content-transfer-
   encoding, as defined in MIME Section 2.8 [RFC2045].  In UTF-8 mode,
   both UTF-8 and ASCII messages are sent to the client as-is (without
   conversion).  When not in UTF-8 mode, UTF-8 messages in a native
   UTF-8 maildrop MUST NOT be sent to the client as-is.  If a client
   requests a UTF-8 message when not in UTF-8 mode, the server MUST
   either create the message content variant (discussed in Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-eai-5738bis]) it sends to the client to comply with
   unextended POP and Internet Mail Format without UTF-8 mode support,
   or fail the request with a -ERR response containing the UTF-8
   response code (see section 5).  The UTF8 command MAY fail.

   Note that even in UTF-8 mode, MIME binary content-transfer-encoding
   as defined in MIME Section 6.2 [RFC2045] is still not permitted.

   The octet count (size) of a message reported in a response to the
   LIST command SHOULD match the actual number of octets sent in a RETR
   response (not counting byte-stuffing).  Sizes reported elsewhere,
   such as in STAT responses and non-standardized, free-form text in
   positive status indicators (following "+OK") need not be accurate,
   but it is preferable if they were.

   Normal operation for UTF-8 maildrops will be for both servers and
   clients to support the extension discussed in this specification.
   Upgrading of both clients and servers is the only fully satisfactory
   way to support the capabilities offered by the "UTF8" extension and
   SMTPUTF8 mail more generally.  Servers must, however, anticipate the
   possibility of a client attempting to access a message that requires

Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8                June 2012


   this extension without having issued the "UTF8" command.  There are
   no completely satisfactory responses for that case other than
   upgrading the client to support this specification.  One solution,
   unsatisfactory because the user may be confused by being able to
   access the message through some means and not others, is that a
   server MAY choose to reject the command to retrieve the message as
   discussed in Section 5.  Other alternatives, including the
   possibility of creating and delivering variant form of the message,
   are discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-eai-5738bis].

   Clients MUST NOT issue the STLS command [RFC2595] after issuing UTF8;
   servers MAY (but are not required to) enforce this by rejecting with
   an "-ERR" response an STLS command issued subsequent to a successful
   UTF8 command.  (Because this is a protocol error as opposed to a
   failure based on conditions, an extended response code [RFC2449] is
   not specified.)

3.2.  USER Argument to UTF8 Capability

   If the USER argument is included with this capability, it indicates
   that the server accepts UTF-8 user names and passwords.

   Servers that include the USER argument in the UTF8 capability
   response SHOULD apply SASLprep [RFC4013] to the arguments of the USER
   and PASS commands.

   A client or server that supports APOP and permits UTF-8 in user names
   or passwords MUST apply SASLprep [RFC4013] to the user name and
   password used to compute the APOP digest.

   When applying SASLprep [RFC4013], servers MUST reject UTF-8 user
   names or passwords that contain a Unicode character listed in Section
   2.3 of SASLprep [RFC4013].  When applying SASLprep to the USER
   argument, the PASS argument, or the APOP username argument, a
   compliant server or client MUST treat them as a query string
   [RFC3454](i.e., unassigned Unicode code points are allowed).  When
   applying SASLprep to the APOP password argument, a compliant server
   or client MUST treat them as a stored string [RFC3454] (i.e.,
   unassigned Unicode code points are prohibited).

   The client does not need to issue the UTF8 command prior to using
   UTF-8 in authentication.  However, clients MUST NOT use UTF-8
   characters in USER, PASS, or APOP commands unless the USER argument
   is included in the UTF8 capability response.

   The server MUST reject UTF-8 user names or passwords that fail to
   comply with the formal syntax in UTF-8 [RFC3629].

Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8                June 2012


   Use of UTF-8 characters in the AUTH command is governed by the POP3
   SASL [RFC5034] mechanism.

4.  Native UTF-8 Maildrops

   When a POP3 server uses a native UTF-8 maildrop, it is the
   responsibility of the server to comply with the POP3 base
   specification [RFC1939] and Internet Message Format [RFC5322] when
   not in UTF-8 mode.  When the server is not in UTF-8 mode and the
   message requires that mode, requests to download the message MAY be
   rejected (as specified in the next section) or the various other
   alternatives outlined in Section 3.1 above and in Section 7 of the
   IMAP UTF-8 specification [draft-ietf-eai-5738bis], including creation
   and delivery of variations on the original message, MAY be
   considered.

5.  UTF8 Response Code

   Per "POP3 Extension Mechanism" [RFC2449], this document adds a new
   response code: UTF8, described below.

   Complete response code:
      UTF8

   Valid for responses:
      -ERR

   Valid for commands:
      LIST, TOP, RETR

   Response code meaning and expected client behavior:

   The UTF8 response code indicates that a failure is due to a request
   when not in UTF-8 mode for message content containing UTF-8
   characters.

   The client MAY reissue the command after entering UTF-8 mode.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Section 2 and 3 of this specification update two capabilities ("UTF8"
   and "LANG") to the POP3 capability registry [RFC2449].

   Section 5 of this specification also adds one new response code
   ("UTF8") to the POP3 response codes registry [RFC2449].

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of UTF-8 [RFC3629] and SASLprep [RFC4013]
   apply to this specification, particularly with respect to use of
   UTF-8 in user names and passwords.

   The "LANG *" command might reveal the existence and preferred
   language of a user to an active attacker probing the system if the
   active language changes in response to the USER, PASS, or APOP
   commands prior to validating the user's credentials.  Servers are
   strongly advised to implement a configuration to prevent this
   exposure.

   It is possible for a man-in-the-middle attacker to insert a LANG
   command in the command stream, thus making protocol-level diagnostic
   responses unintelligible to the user.  A mechanism to protect the
   integrity of the session, such as , Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC2595] can be used to defeat such attacks.

   Modifying server authentication code (in this case, to support UTF8
   command) needs to be done with care to avoid introducing
   vulnerabilities (for example, in string parsing).

Appendix A.  Design Rationale

   This non-normative section discusses the reasons behind some of the
   design choices in the above specification.

   Due to interoperability problems with RFC 2047 and limited deployment
   of RFC 2231, it is hoped these 7-bit encoding mechanisms can be
   deprecated in the future when UTF-8 header support becomes prevalent.

   USER is optional because the implementation burden of SASLprep
   [RFC4013] is not well understood, and mandating such support in all
   cases could negatively impact deployment.
