	This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	(DHCPv4 and DHCPv6) options providing lists of IP addresses
	that can be used to locate network management services, specifically
	for the collection of logs and of Simple Network Management Protocol 
	(SNMP) notifications.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>
      New networks such as 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) are being deployed
      today with tens of thousands of network nodes. All of these nodes have to
      be configured and monitored for the network to operate correctly. Any
      steps to automate this process will be helpful to reduce the cost of
      deployment. </t> 
      
      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (<xref target="RFC2131">
      DHCPv4 </xref> and <xref target="RFC3315"> DHCPv6 </xref>) is a relevant
      tool for this purpose. It provides a number of existing options to allow a
      node to acquire its configuration file and to locate key servers
      in the network. However, the existing options have been defined more with
      end hosts than with network nodes in mind. Network nodes require active
      management, and therefore need to acquire the addresses of their
      management servers.      </t>
      
      <t>This document is specifically focussed on the requirement for event
      reporting. To that end, it defines new DHCP options capable of listing:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>one or more addresses of SYSLOG <xref target="RFC5424"/> collectors;</t>
        <t>one or more addresses of SNMP <xref target="RFC3410"/> entities
        hosting Notification Receiver applications.</t> 
      </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>
	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
	NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
	"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
	in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.
      </t>

    <section anchor="syslog" title="DHC Options for SYSLOG">
      <t>
	The SYSLOG protocol <xref target="RFC5424"/> supports several
	transport mappings. According to RFC 5424, implementations
	MUST support the TLS/TCP-based transport defined in
	<xref target="RFC5425"/> and they SHOULD also support the
	UDP-based transport defined in <xref target="RFC5426"/> for
	compatibility with traditional SYSLOG.  An optional transport
	of SYSLOG messages over DTLS/DCCP and DTLS/UDP is defined in
	<xref target="RFC6012"/>.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	The DHC options described below provide a list of IPv4 or IPv6
	addresses of SYSLOG collectors in order of preference. The
	client SHOULD use the addresses sequentially but may be
	configured to try secure and/or congestion aware transports
	before falling back to transports that are not congestion
	aware or insecure. As such, the client may prefer to select an
	address providing a secure congestion aware transport even if
	it is listed with lower preference.
      </t>
      
      <section anchor="syslog-v4" 
	       title="SYSLOG Collector Address Option for DHCPv4">
	<t>
	  This section describes the SYSLOG IPv4 Address Option for
	  DHCPv4.  The SYSLOG IPv4 Address Option begins with an
	  option code followed by a length octet. The value of the
	  length octet does not include itself or the option code.
	  The option layout is depicted below:

	  The code for the SYSLOG DHCPv4 option is [IANA: TBD1]. The
	  minimum length of the option is 4 octets, and the length
	  MUST always be a multiple of 4.

	  The option MUST NOT be specified by the DHCPv4 client, as it
	  is intended only to be returned from the DHCPv4 server.  If
	  the DHCPv4 client wants to receive this information from the
	  server, it needs to include the number [IANA: TBD1] in the
	  "DHCP Parameter Request List" option (55).
	</t>
	<t>
	  Server addresses SHOULD be listed in order of preference,
	  and the client SHOULD use the addresses sequentially but may
	  be configured to use addresses in a different order
	  according to some local policy (e.g., the client prefers
	  secure and/or congestion aware transports as described
	  above).

      <t>Historical note: DHCPv4 option 7 was originally defined (Section 3.9 of
      <xref target="RFC2132"/>) to provide the addresses of one or more log
      servers. However, the logging technology concerned was specified to be
      "MIT-LCS UDP log servers". It seems preferable to define a new option for
      SYSLOG collectors.</t>

	It is recommended to use the DHCPv4 authentication option

	In IPv6 networks using DHCPv6, it is recommended that clients

	A matching volatile entry in the snmpNotifyTable can also be
	easily created:
      </t>
      <figure>
	<artwork>
snmpNotifyName                = "dhcp-xyz"         (INDEX)
snmpNotifyTag                 = "dhcp-xyz-tag"

snmpNotifyStorageType         = volatile(2)
snmpNotifyRowStatus           = active(1)
	</artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
	In addition, an entry in the snmpTargetParamsTable is needed.
	Its structure for SNMPv3/USM user "joe" is as follows:
      </t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
snmpTargetParamsName          = "dhcp-xyz-param"   (INDEX)
snmpTargetParamsMPModel       = 3                  (SNMPv3)
snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel = 3                  (USM)
snmpTargetParamsSecurityName  = "joe"
snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel = authNoPriv(2) 
snmpTargetParamsStorageType   = volatile(2)
snmpTargetParamsRowStatus     = active(1)
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
	Creation of a suitable entry in the snmpTargetParamsTable
	requires local information. Depending on the security model,
	additional information will be necessary.
      </t>
      <t>
	The creation of a suitable snmpTargetParamsTable entry may
	either be dynamic (i.e., the entry is created upon receipt of
	a DHC lease using some local policy information and deleted
	when the DHC lease expires) or suitable snmpTargetParamsTable
	entries may be pre-provisioned based on the expected naming of
	the target entries that are created dynamically.
	Implementations may also pre-provision snmpTargetAddrTable
	entries and only dynamically create suitable snmpNotifyTable
	entries.
