Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document provides use cases, directions, and interpretations for
   organizations and relying parties when creating or encountering RPKI
   object scenarios in the public RPKI.  All of the above are discussed
   here in relation to the Internet routing system.

1.1.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280], "A Profile
   for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates" [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs]
   "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779], "A
   Profile for Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)"
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format], "Validation of Route Origination in BGP
   using the Resource Certificate PKI and ROAs"
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation], and BGP Prefix Origin Validation"
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].

1.2.  Definitions

   The following definitions are in use in this document.

   Origin AS - The Autonomous System, designated by an ASN, which
   originates a route.  Seen as the "First" ASN in an AS path.

   Specific route - A route that has a longer prefix mask length in the
   presence of another route with a smaller mask length.

   Aggregate route - A route that has a shorter prefix mask length in
   the presence of a specific route.

   Covering Aggregate - A route that has a shorter prefix mask length
   relative to a route in consideration.

   Multi-homed Autonomous System - An Autonomous System that is
   connected, and announces routes, to two or more Autonomous Systems.

   Multi-homed prefix or subnet - A prefix (i.e., subnet) that is
   originated from two or more Autonomous Systems to which the subnet is
   connected.

   Resource - Internet (IP) addresses or Autonomous System Number.

   Allocation - The set of resources provided to an entity or
   organization for its use.

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


   Sub-allocation - A set of resources subordinate to an allocation
   assigned to another entity or organization.

   Transit Provider - An Autonomous System that carries traffic that
   neither originates nor is the destination of that traffic.

   Upstream - See "Transit Provider".

   Child - A Sub-allocation that has resulted from an Allocation.

   Parent - An allocation from which the subject prefix is a Child.

   Grandchild - A Sub-allocation from one or more previous Sub-
   allocations.

   Grandparent - The allocation from which the subject prefix is a
   Grandchild.

   Update prefix - The prefix seen in a routing update.

   ROA prefix - The prefix described in a ROA.

   Covering Prefix - A ROA Prefix that is an exact match or a less
   specific when compared to the update prefix.

   No relevant ROA - No ROA exists that has a covering prefix for the
   update prefix.

   No other relevant ROA - No other ROA (besides any that is (are)
   already cited) that has a covering prefix for the update prefix.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Overview

2.1.  General interpretation of RPKI object semantics

   It is important that in the interpretation of relying parties (RP),
   or relying party routing software, that a 'make before break' stance
   is applied.  This means that a RP should implement a routing decision
   process where a routing update ("route") is assumed to be intended
   (i.e., considered unsuspicious) unless proven otherwise by the
   existence of a valid RPKI object.  For all of the cases in this



Manderson, et al.          Expires May 3, 2012                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


   document it is assumed that RPKI objects validate in accordance with
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs], [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch],
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation] unless otherwise stated.  In other
   words, we assume that corrupted RPKI objects, if any, have been
   detected and eliminated.

   While many of the examples provided here illustrate organizations
   using their own autonomous system numbers to originate routes, it
   should be recognized that a prefix holder need not necessarily be the
   holder of the autonomous system number used for the route
   origination.


3.  Origination Use Cases

   This section deals with the various use cases where an organization
   has Internet resources and will announce routes to the Internet.  It
   is based on operational observations of the existing routing system.
   In the following use cases, the phrase "relying parties interpret the
   route as intended" is generally meant to indicate that "relying
   parties interpret an announced route as having a valid origination
   AS."

3.1.  Single Announcement

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.2.0/24.  It wishes to announce the /24 prefix from ASN 64496
   such that relying parties interpret the route as intended.

   The desired announcement (and organization) would be:

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   | Organization |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.2.0/24     | AS64496     |   Org A      |
      +----------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party should create a ROA containing the following:

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64496    | 10.1.2.0/24       |    24         |
      +----------------------------------------------+

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


3.2.  Aggregate with a More Specific

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16.  It wishes to announce the more specific prefix
   10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64496 as well as the aggregate route such that
   relying parties interpret the routes as intended.

   The desired announcements (and organization) would be:

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   | Organization |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |   Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64496     |   Org A      |
      +----------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party should create a ROA containing the following:

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64496    | 10.1.0.0/16       |    16         |
      |          |-----------------------------------+
      |          | 10.1.0.0/20       |    20         |
      +----------------------------------------------+



3.3.  Aggregate with a More Specific from a Different ASN

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496 and ASN 64499) has been
   allocated the prefix 10.1.0.0/16.  It wishes to announce the more
   specific prefix 10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64499 as well as the aggregate
   route from ASN 64496 such that relying parties interpret the routes
   as intended.

   The desired announcements (and organization) would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64499     |  Org A      |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party should create ROAs containing the following:

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64496    | 10.1.0.0/16       |    16         |
      +----------------------------------------------+

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64499    | 10.1.0.0/20       |    20         |
      +----------------------------------------------+


3.4.  Sub-allocation to a Multi-homed Customer

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16; it wishes to announce the more specific prefix
   10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64496.  It has further delegated 10.1.16.0/20 to
   a customer (Org B with ASN 64511) who is multi-homed and will
   originate the prefix route from ASN 64511.  ASN 64496 will also
   announce the aggregate route such that relying parties interpret the
   routes as intended.

   The desired announcements (and organization) would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.16.0/20    | AS64511     |  Org B      |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party should create ROAs containing the following:

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


      Org A.
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64496    | 10.1.0.0/16       |    16         |
      |          |-----------------------------------+
      |          | 10.1.0.0/20       |    20         |
      +----------------------------------------------+

      Org B.
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64511    | 10.1.16.0/20      |    20         |
      +----------------------------------------------+

3.5.  Restriction of a New Allocation

   An organization has recently been allocated the prefix 10.1.0.0/16.
   Its network deployment is not yet ready to announce the prefix and
   wishes to restrict all possible announcements of 10.1.0.0/16 and more
   specifics in routing using RPKI.

   The following announcements would be considered undesirable:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      | 10.1.17.0/24    | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party should create a ROA containing the following:


      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      |    0     | 10.1.0.0/16       |    32         |
      +----------------------------------------------+



   This is known as an AS0-ROA [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation]

3.6.  Restriction of New ASN

   An organization has recently been allocated an additional ASN 65535.
   Its network deployment is not yet ready to use this ASN and wishes to
   restrict all possible uses of ASN 65535 using RPKI.

   The following announcements would be considered undesirable:

   It is currently not possible to restrict use of Autonomous System
   Numbers

3.7.  Restriction of a Part of an Allocation

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16.  Its network topology permits the announcement of
   10.1.0.0/17 and the /16 aggregate.  However it wishes to restrict any
   possible announcement of 10.1.128.0/17 or more specifics of that /17
   using RPKI.

   The desired announcements would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/17     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The following announcements would be considered undesirable:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.128.0/17   | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      | 10.1.128.0/24   | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party should create ROAs containing the following:

      +----------------------------------------------+

3.8.  Restriction of Prefix Length

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16; it wishes to announce the aggregate and any or all more
   specific prefixes up to and including a maximum length of /20, but
   never any more specific than a /20.

   Examples of the desired announcements (and organization) would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/17     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      |     ...         | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.128.0/20   | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The following announcements would be considered undesirable:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/21     | ANY AS      |  ANY        |

      | 10.1.128.0/24   | ANY AS      |  ANY        |
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party should create a ROA containing the following:

      +----------------------------------------------+


3.9.  Restriction of Sub-allocation Prefix Length

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16; it sub-allocates several /20 prefixes to its multi-homed
   customers Org B with ASN 65535, and Org C with ASN 64499.  It wishes
   to restrict those customers from advertising any corresponding routes
   more specific than a /22.

   The desired announcements would be:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      |
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS65535     |  Org B      |

      | 10.1.4.0/22     | AS65535     |  Org B
      +---------------------------------------------+

   The following example announcements (and organization) would be
   considered undesirable:

      +---------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization |
      +---------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/24     | AS65535     |  Org B      |

      +---------------------------------------------+

   The issuing party (Org A) should create ROAs containing the
   following:

3.10.  Aggregation and Origination by an Upstream

   Consider four organizations with the following resources, which were
   acquired independently from any transit provider.

      +-------------------------------------------------+
      | Organization     | ASN     |    Prefix          |
      +-------------------------------------------------+
      | Org A            | AS64496 |  10.1.0.0/24       |
      | Org B            | AS65535 |  10.1.3.0/24       |
      | Org C            | AS64499 |  10.1.1.0/24       |
      | Org D            | AS64512 |  10.1.2.0/24       |
      +-------------------------------------------------+

   These organizations share a common upstream provider Transit A (ASN
   64497) that originates an aggregate of these prefixes with the
   permission of all four organizations.

   The desired announcements (and organization) would be:

      | 10.1.0.0/22     | AS64497     |   Transit A  |
      +----------------------------------------------+

   It is currently not possible for an upstream to make a valid
   aggregate announcement of independent prefixes.  However the issuing
   parties should create ROAs containing the following:

3.11.  Rogue Aggregation and Origination by an Upstream

   Consider four organizations with the following resources that were
   acquired independently from any transit provider.

      +-------------------------------------------------+
      | Organization     | ASN     |    Prefix          |
      +-------------------------------------------------+
      | Org A            | AS64496 |  10.1.0.0/24       |
      | Org B            | AS65535 |  10.1.3.0/24       |
      | Org C            | AS64499 |  10.1.1.0/24       |
      | Org D            | AS64512 |  10.1.2.0/24       |
      +-------------------------------------------------+

   These organizations share a common upstream provider Transit A (ASN
   64497) that originates an aggregate of these prefixes where possible.
   In this situation organization B (ASN 65535, 10.1.3.0/24) does not
   wish for its prefix to be aggregated by the upstream provider.

   The desired announcements (and organization) would be:

      +----------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   | Organization |
      +----------------------------------------------+

4.  Adjacency or Path Validation Use Cases

   The SIDR WG was recently re-chartered (April 2011) to address AS path
   validation.  Use cases pertaining to adjacency or path validation are
   beyond the scope of this document and would be addressed in a
   separate document.


5.  Partial Deployment Use Cases

5.1.  Parent Does Not Participate in RPKI

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64511) is multi-homed and has been
   assigned the prefix 10.1.0.0/20 from its upstream (Transit X with ASN
   64496).  Org A wishes to announce the prefix 10.1.0.0/20 from ASN
   64511 to its other upstream(s).  Org A also wishes to create RPKI
   statements about the resource; however Transit X (ASN 64496) which

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


   announces the aggregate 10.1.0.0/16 has not yet adopted RPKI.

   The desired announcements (and organization with RPKI adoption) would
   be:

      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization | RPKI |
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/20     | AS64511     |  Org A      | Yes  |
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Transit X  | No   |
      +----------------------------------------------------+

   RPKI is strictly hierarchical; therefore if Transit X does not
   participate in RPKI, Org A is unable to validly issue RPKI objects.

5.2.  Only Some Children Participate in RPKI

   An organization (Org A with ASN 64496) has been allocated the prefix
   10.1.0.0/16 and participates in RPKI; it wishes to announce the more
   specific prefix 10.1.0.0/20 from ASN 64496.  It has further delegated
   10.1.16.0/20 and 10.1.32.0/20 to customers Org B with ASN 64511 and
   Org C with ASN 65535 (respectively) who are multi-homed.  Org B (ASN
   64511) does not participate in RPKI.  Org C (ASN 65535) participates
   in RPKI.

   The desired announcements (and organization with RPKI adoption) would
   be:

      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | Prefix          | Origin AS   |Organization | RPKI |
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | 10.1.0.0/16     | AS64496     |  Org A      | Yes  |

5.3.  Grandchild Does Not Participate in RPKI

   Consider the previous example with an extension by where Org B, who
   does not participate in RPKI, further allocates 10.1.17.0/24 to Org X
   with ASN 64512.  Org X does not participate in RPKI.

   The desired announcements (and organization with RPKI adoption) would
   be:

6.  Transfer Use Cases

   For transfer use cases, based on the preceding sections, it should be
   easy to deduce what new ROAs need to be created and what existing
   ones need to be maintained (or revoked).  The resource transfer and
   timing of revocation/creation of the ROAs need to be performed based
   on the make-before-break principle and using suitable RIR procedures.

6.1.  Transfer of in-use prefix and autonomous system number

   Organization A holds the resource 10.1.0.0/20 and it is currently in
   use and originated from AS64496 with valid RPKI objects in place.
   Organization B has acquired both the prefix and ASN and desires an
   RPKI transfer on a particular date and time without adversely
   affecting the operational use of the resource.

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


   The following RPKI objects would be created/revoked:

      For Org. A, revoke the following ROA:
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64496    | 10.1.0.0/20       |    20         |
      +----------------------------------------------+


      For Org. B, add the following ROA:
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64496    | 10.1.0.0/20       |    20         |
      +----------------------------------------------+

6.2.  Transfer of in-use prefix

   Organization A holds the resource 10.1.0.0/8 and it is currently in
   use and originated from AS64496 with valid RPKI objects in place.
   Organization B has acquired the address and desires an RPKI transfer
   on a particular date and time.  This prefix will be originated by
   AS65535 as a result of this transfer.

   The following RPKI objects would be created/revoked:

      For Org. A, revoke the following ROA:
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64496    | 10.1.0.0/8        |    8          |
      +----------------------------------------------+


      For Org. B, add the following ROA when the
      resource certificate for 10.1.0.0/8 is issued to
      them (Org. B):
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 65535    | 10.1.0.0/8        |    8          |
      +----------------------------------------------+

6.3.  Transfer of unused prefix

   Organization A holds the resource 10.1.0.0/8 and AS65535 (with RPKI
   objects).  Organization B has acquired an unused portion
   (10.1.4.0/24) of the prefix and desires an RPKI transfer on a
   particular date and time.  Organization B will originate a route
   10.1.4.0/24 from AS64496

   The following RPKI objects would be created/revoked:

      For Org. A, leave the following ROA unchanged:
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 65535    | 10.1.0.0/8        |    8          |
      +----------------------------------------------+


      For Org. B, add the following ROA when the
      resource certificate for 10.1.4.0/24 is issued
      to them (Org. B):
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64496    | 10.1.4.0/24       |    24         |
      +----------------------------------------------+

   Organization A may optionally provide ROA coverage for Organization B
   by creating the following ROA preceding the RPKI transfer.  The ROA
   itself is then naturally revoked when 10.1.4.0/24 is transferred to
   Organization B's resource certificate.

      Org. A, adds the following ROA:
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | asID     | address           | maxLength     |
      +----------------------------------------------+
      | 64496    | 10.1.4.0/24       |    24         |
      +----------------------------------------------+


7.  Relying Party Use Cases

7.1.  Prefix-Origin Validation use cases

   These use cases try to systematically enumerate the situations a
   relying party may encounter while receiving a BGP update and making
   use of ROA information to interpret the validity of the prefix-origin
   information in the update.  We enumerate the situations or scenarios



Manderson, et al.          Expires May 3, 2012                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


   and include a recommendation for the expected outcome of prefix-
   origin validation.  For a description of prefix-origin validation
   algorithms, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation] and
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].  We use the terms Valid, Invalid, and
   Unknown as defined in [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-validation].  Also see
   [I-D.ietf-idr-deprecate-as-sets] for work-in-progress in the IDR WG
   to deprecate AS_SETs in BGP updates.  The use cases described here
   can be potentially used as test cases for testing and evaluation of
   prefix-origin validation in router implementations; see for example
   [BRITE].

7.1.1.  Covering ROA Prefix, maxLength Satisfied, and AS Match

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/16, maxLength = 20, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.0.0/17, Origin = AS64496}

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update is
   Valid.

   Comment: This is a straightforward prefix-origin validation use case;
   it follows from the primary intention of creation of ROA by a
   resource owner.

7.1.2.  Covering ROA Prefix, maxLength Exceeded, and AS Match

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/16, maxLength = 20, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.0.0/22, Origin = AS64496}

   No other relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update is
   Invalid.

   Comment: In this case the maxLength specified in the ROA is exceeded
   by the update prefix.

7.1.3.  Covering ROA Prefix, maxLength Satisfied, and AS Mismatch:

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/16, maxLength = 24, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.88.0/24, Origin = AS65535}

   No other relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update is
   Invalid.

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


   Comment: In this case an AS other than the one specified in the ROA
   is originating an update.  This may be a prefix or subprefix hijack
   situation.

7.1.4.  Covering ROA Prefix, maxLength Exceeded, and AS Mismatch

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/16, maxLength = 22, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.88.0/24, Origin = AS65535}

   No other relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update is
   Invalid.

   Comment: In this case the maxLength specified in the ROA is exceeded
   by the update prefix, and also an AS other than the one specified in
   the ROA is originating the update.  This may be a subprefix hijack
   situation.

7.1.5.  Covering ROA Prefix Not Found

   Update has {240.1.1.0/24, Origin = AS65535}

   No relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update's
   validation status is Unknown.

   Comment: In this case there is no relevant ROA that has a covering
   prefix for the update prefix.  It could be a case of prefix or
   subprefix hijack situation, but this announcement does not contradict
   any existing ROA.  During partial deployment, there would be some
   legitimate prefix-origin announcements for which ROAs may not have
   been issued yet.

7.1.6.  Covering ROA Prefix Not Found but ROAs Exist for a Covering Set
        of More Specifics

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/18, maxLength = 20, AS64496}

   ROA: {10.1.64.0/18, maxLength = 20, AS64496}

   ROA: {10.1.128.0/18, maxLength = 20, AS64496}

   ROA: {10.1.192.0/18, maxLength = 20, AS64496}

   Update has {10.1.0.0/16, Origin = AS64496}

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


   No (directly) relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update's
   validation status is Unknown.

   Comment: In this case the update prefix is an aggregate, and it turns
   out that there exit ROAs for more specifics that, if combined, can
   help support validation of the announced prefix-origin pair.  But it
   is very hard in general to breakup an announced prefix into
   constituent more specifics and check for ROA coverage for those more
   specifics, and hence this type of accommodation is not recommended.

7.1.7.  AS_SET in Update and Covering ROA Prefix Not Found

   Update has {10.1.0.0/16, Origin = [AS64496, AS64497, AS64498,
   AS64499]}

   No relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update's
   validation status is Unknown.

   Comment: An extremely small percentage (~0.1%) of eBGP updates are
   seen to have an AS_SET in them as origin; this is known as proxy
   aggregation.  In this case, update with the AS_SET does not conflict
   with any ROA.

7.1.8.  Singleton AS in AS_SET (in the Update), Covering ROA Prefix, and
        AS Match

   Update has {10.1.0.0/24, Origin = [AS64496]}

   (Note: AS_SET with singleton AS appears in origin AS position.)

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/22, maxLength = 24, AS64496}

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update is
   Invalid.

   Comment: In the spirit of [I-D.ietf-idr-deprecate-as-sets], any
   update with an AS_SET in it should not be considered valid (by ROA-
   based validation).  If the update contains an AS_SET and a covering
   ROA exists, then no attempt should be made to match the ASN in the
   update with that in the covering ROA and the update should get an
   Invalid status.

7.1.9.  Singleton AS in AS_SET (in the Update), Covering ROA Prefix, and
        AS Mismatch

   Update has {10.1.0.0/24, Origin = [AS64496]}

   (Note: AS_SET with singleton AS appears in origin AS position.)

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/22, maxLength = 24, AS65535}

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update is
   Invalid.

   Comment: When there is at least one covering ROA, then the update
   with an AS_SET should get an Invalid status regardless of whether
   there is AS match or mismatch.

7.1.10.  Multiple ASs in AS_SET (in the Update) and Covering ROA Prefix

   Update has {10.1.0.0/22, Origin = [AS64496, AS64497, AS64498,
   AS64499]}

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/22, maxLength = 24, AS65535}

   No other relevant ROA.

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update is
   Invalid.

   Comment: When there is at least one covering ROA, then the update
   with an AS_SET should get an Invalid status.

7.1.11.  Update has an AS_SET as Origin and ROAs Exist for a Covering
         Set of More Specifics

   ROA: {10.1.0.0/18, maxLength = 20, AS64496}

   ROA: {10.1.64.0/18, maxLength = 20, AS64497}

   ROA: {10.1.128.0/18, maxLength = 20, AS64498}

   ROA: {10.1.192.0/18, maxLength = 20, AS64499}

   Update has {10.1.0.0/16, Origin = [AS64496, AS64497, AS64498,
   AS64499]}

   No (directly) relevant ROA

   Recommended RPKI prefix-origin validation interpretation: Update's

   validation status is Unknown.

   Comment: In this case the aggregate of the prefixes in the ROAs is a
   covering prefix for the update prefix.  The ASs in each of the
   contributing ROAs together form a set that matches the AS_SET in the
   update.  But it is very hard in general to breakup an announced
   prefix into constituent more specifics and check for ROA coverage for
   those more specifics.  In any case, it may be noted once again that
   in the spirit of [I-D.ietf-idr-deprecate-as-sets], any update with an
   AS_SET in it should not be considered valid (by ROA-based
   validation).  In fact, the update in consideration would have
   received an Invalid status if there were at least one covering ROA.

7.2.  ROA Expiry or receipt of a CRL covering a ROA

   Here we enumerate use cases corresponding to router actions when RPKI
   objects expire or are revoked.  In the cases which follow, the terms
   "expired ROA" or "revoked ROA" are shorthand, and describe the
   appropriate expiry or revocation of the EE or Resource Certificate(s)
   that causes a relying party to consider the corresponding ROA to have
   expired or revoked.

7.2.1.  ROA of Parent Prefix is Revoked

   A certificate revocation list (CRL) is received which reveals that
   the ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/22; maxLength 24 with ASN64496
   is revoked.  Further, a prefix route exists in the Internet routing
   system for 10.1.4.0/24 originated from ASN64496.  In absence of the
   revoked ROA, no covering ROA exists for 10.1.4.0/24.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: Route validation status is
   Unknown

7.2.2.  ROA of Prefix Revoked while Parent Has Covering ROA with
        Different ASN

   A CRL is received which reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  A covering ROA exists for a parent prefix
   10.1.4.0/22; maxLength 24 with ASN65535.  No other covering ROA
   exists for the 10.1.4.0/24 prefix.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: Route is Invalid.

Internet-Draft      RPKI Use Case and Interpretations       October 2011


7.2.3.  ROA of Prefix Revoked while that of Parent Prefix Prevails

   A CRL is received which reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the parent prefix 10.1.0.0/22; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: Route is Valid.

   (Clarification: Perhaps the revocation of ROA for prefix 10.1.4.0/24
   was initiated just to eliminate redundancy.)

7.2.4.  ROA of Grandparent Prefix Revoked while that of Parent Prefix
        Prevails

   A CRL is received which reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/22; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: Route is Valid.

   (Clarification: ROA for less specific grandparent prefix 10.1.0.0/20
   was revoked or withdrawn.)

7.2.5.  Expiry of ROA of Parent Prefix

   A scan of the ROA list reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.0.0/22; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 has expired.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  In absence of the expired ROA, no covering
   ROA exists for 10.1.4.0/24.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: Route validation status is
   Unknown

7.2.6.  Expiry of ROA of Prefix while Parent Has Covering ROA with
        Different ASN

   A scan of the ROA list reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 has expired.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  A valid covering ROA exists for a parent
   prefix 10.1.4.0/22; maxLength 24 with ASN65535.  No other covering

   ROA exists for the prefix.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: Route is Invalid.

7.2.7.  Expiry of ROA of Prefix while that of Parent Prefix Prevails

   A scan of the ROA list reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.4.0/24; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 has expired.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the parent prefix 10.1.0.0/22; maxLength 24 with
   ASN64496.

   The Relying Party interpretation would be: Route is Valid.

7.2.8.  Expiry of ROA of Grandparent Prefix while that of Parent Prefix
        Prevails

   A scan of the ROA list reveals that the ROA containing the prefix
   10.1.0.0/20; maxLength 24 with ASN64496 is revoked.  Further, a
   prefix route exists in the Internet routing system for 10.1.4.0/24
   originated from ASN64496.  Additionally, the current ROA list has a
   valid ROA containing the prefix 10.1.0.0/22; maxLength 24 with
