Abstract

   This document describes a method to accomplish performance monitoring
   measurements on real traffic, applicable to any packet-based stream,
   including L2, L3, MPLS traffic, unicast and multicast.  The method
   can be easily implemented using tools and features already available
   on existing routing platforms without any protocol extension and, for
   this reason, it does not raise any interoperability issue.  However,
   the method could be further improved by means of some extension to
   existing protocols, but this aspect is left for further study and it
   is out of the scope of the document.

Internet-Draft  Method for passive performance monitoring   October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The increasing deployment in service provider networks of highly
   sensitive applications demands for mechanisms able to monitor and
   measure network performances in terms of packet loss, one-way delay,
   two-way delay and delay variation.

   The main driver for a network operator to measure performance metrics
   is Service Level Agreements (SLA) verification: when a SLA is agreed
   between service provider and customer, it is very important for the
   operator to know the quality of end-user experience and whether the
   performance of the production network meets SLA requirements.  On the
   other hand, performance monitoring provides useful information on the
   network itself, facilitating the troubleshooting and the localization
   of network problems.

   This document describes a mechanism to enable simple and efficient
   performamce monitoring on real traffic.  The method can be applied to
   any kind of packet-based traffic, L2, L3, MPLS, unicast and multicast
   and doesn't require any protocol extension or interaction with
   existing protocols, releasing the mechanism from any interoperability
   issue.  In addition, one important advantage of the mechanism is the
   ability to perform passive measurements: compared to active
   measurements performed with artificial traffic and probes, retrieving
   performance statistics from the real traffic has many benefits.
   Measurements relying on real traffic are more precise because sampled
   probing packets can yield biased results.  Moreover, active
   measurements can produce inaccurate results if artificial traffic
   doesn't follow the same path followed by user traffic.  Finally, even
   if probes follow the same path as the real flow, it is not guaranteed
   that they are treated like user traffic from a QoS point of view.

   There is a lot of work related to OAM and
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-oam-overview] provides a good overview of existing
   OAM mechanisms defined in IETF, ITU-T and IEEE.  In IETF in
   particular there is a lot of work on fault detection and connectivity
   verification, while a minor effort is dedicated to performance
   monitoring.  IPPM WG has defined standard metrics to measure network
   performance, however the metrics developed in the WG refer to an
   active measurement context where the devices used to measure the
   metrics produce their own traffic.  [RFC6374] specifies protocol
   mechanisms to enable the measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-
   way delay and delay variation in MPLS networks.

   This document provides a general mechanism to enable accurate
   performance monitoring of any kind of traffic in a service provider
   network.

2.  Overview of the method

   The method addresses primarily packet loss measurement, but it can be
   easily extended to one-way delay and delay variation measurements as
   well.

   In order to perform packet loss measurements on a real flow it is
   possible to follow several approaches.  The most intuitive one
   consists in numbering the packets so that each router receiving that
   flow is able to immediately detect a missing packet.  Such approach,
   though very simple in theory, is not as simple to achieve: it
   requires to insert a sequence number in each packet and to have an
   equipment able to extract the number and check it in real time.  A
   similar task can be difficult to implement on real traffic: if UDP is
   used as the transport protocol, the sequence number is not available,
   on the other hand, if a higher layer sequence number (e.g. in the RTP
   header) is used, extracting the information from the RTP header on
   every packet and process it in real-time can overload the equipment.

   An alternative approach is to count the number of packets sent on one
   end of the measurement and the packets received on the other end of
   the measurement and to compare those two values.  This operation is
   much simpler to implement than numbering each packet, but requires a
   kind of synchronization between the routers performing the
   measurement: in order to compare two counters it is required that
   they refer exactly to the same set of packets.  Since a flow is
   continuous and cannot be stopped when a counter has to be read, it
   can be difficult to determine exactly at which point of time to read
   the counter.  A possible solution to overcome this problem is to
   virtually split the flow in blocks inserting periodic delimitations
   so that each counter refers exactly to a single block of packets.
   The delimitation can be done f.i. inserting periodically in the flow
   a packet generated to this purpose.

   Compared to numbering, the second approach is easier to implement,
   however, delimiting the flow using specific packets can have some
   limits.  First of all it requires to generate additional packets
   within the flow and requires the equipment to be able to process
   those packets.  In addition the method is vulnerable to delimiting
   packets losses: if a delimiting packet is loss, blocks are affected
   thus producing wrong measurements.

   The method proposed in this document follows the second approach
   described, but doesn't use additional packets to virtually split the
   flow in blocks.  Instead, it "colors" the flow so that packets
   belonging to different consecutive blocks have a different color and
   all the packets belonging to the same block have the same color.
   Using this simple principle it is possible to efficiently measure

   packet loss on real traffic streams without the need to number
   packets or generate additional artificial packets.

   Considering the principles just mentioned, the method allows a
   network operator to perform performance monitoring on real traffic
   with the following advantages:

   o  easy implementation: it can be implemented using features already
      available on major routing platforms;

   o  low computational effort;

   o  highly precise packet loss measurement (single packet loss
      granularity);

   o  applicability to any kind of traffic (L2, L3, MPLS, unicast,
      multicast);

   o  no interoperability issues.

   Figure 1 represents a very simple network and shows how the method
   can be used to measure packet loss on different network segments:
   enabling the measurement on several interfaces along the path, it is
   possible to perform link monitoring, node monitoring or end-to-end
   monitoring.  More generally the method is flexible enough to measure
   packet loss on any segment of the network.

3.  Detailed description of the method

   This section describes in detail how the method can be used to
   measure packet loss on real traffic in a packet-switched network.

3.1.  Packet Loss

   The basic idea is to virtually split the traffic in blocks that could
   be easily and unambiguously identified: counting the number of
   packets of each block and comparing the values obtained in different
   measurement points along the path, it is possible to measure packet
   loss occurred in any single block between any two points.

   The following figure shows how blocks are created generating periodic
   delimitation points in the flow.

            |           |           |           |           |
            |           |    Traffic flow       |           |
    ========|===========|===========|===========|===========|==========>
       ...  |  Block 5  |  Block 4  |  Block 3  |  Block 2  |  Block 1
            |           |           |           |           |


                   Figure 2: Traffic delimitation points

   A simple way to create delimitation points is to "color" the traffic
   with two different colors and change the color periodically.
   Whenever the color changes the current block terminates and the
   following one begins.  Hence all the packets belonging to the same
   block have the same color and packets of different consecutive blocks
   have a different color.  The number of packets in each block depends
   on the criterion used to create the blocks: if the color switches
   every fixed number of packets, each block contains the same number of
   packets, but if the color switches according to a timer, the number
   of packets may be different in each block and dependent on the bit
   rate.

   The following figure shows how a flow looks like when it is split in
   traffic blocks coloring packets.

                        Figure 3: Traffic coloring

   Figure 4 shows how the method can be used to measure link packet loss
   between two adjacent nodes.

   Referring to the figure, let's assume we want to monitor the packet
   loss on the link between R1 and R2.  According to the method here
   described, traffic is colored alternatively with two different
   colors, A and B, and whenever the color changes, a demarcation point
   is created, generating a sort of square-wave signal where original
   traffic flow is virtually split in a sequence of blocks.

            ===========================================================>

      Figure 4: Application of the method to compute link packet loss

   Traffic coloring can be executed by R1 itself or by an upward router.
   R1 needs two counters, C(A)R1 and C(B)R1, in its egress interface in
   order to count the number of packets sent out the interface and
   colored respectively with color A and B. As long as traffic is
   colored A, only counter C(A)R1 is incremented while C(B)R1 is still,
   viceversa during a B block only C(B)R1 is incremented while C(A)R1 is



Tempia Bonda, et al.     Expires April 30, 2012                 [Page 7]

   still.  C(A)R1 and C(B)R1 can be used as reference values to
   determine the packet loss from R1 to any other measurement point down
   the path.  Router R2, similarly, will need on its ingress interface
   two counters, C(A)R2 and C(B)R2, to count the number of packets
   received on the interface and colored with color A and B
   respectively.  When an A block terminates it is possible to compare
   C(A)R1 and C(A)R2 determining any packet loss within the block,
   similarly when the successive B block terminates it is possible to
   compare C(B)R1 with C(B)R2 determining any packet loss in that block,
   and so on for every successive block.

   Similarly, using other 2 counters on R2 egress interface it is
   possible to count the number of packets sent out R2 interface and use
   them as reference values to determine the packet loss from R2 to any
   measurement point down R2.

   The method doesn't require any synchronization in the network, as the
   traffic flow implicitly carries the synchronization in the
   alternation of colors.  In addition, splitting the flow in blocks,
   the method is able not only to detect any packet loss, but also to
   provide information about when the packet loss has occurred and in
   which point of the network.

   The following table shows how router counters can be used to
   calculate the packet loss between R1 and R2.  The first column lists
   the sequence of traffic blocks while the other columns contain the
   counters of A-colored packets and B-colored packets for R1 and R2.
   In this example, we assume that counter values are reset whenever a
   block ends and the relative counter is read: with this assumption the
   table shows only relative counter values, that is the exact number of
   packets of each color within each block.  If counter values were not
   reset, the table would contain cumulative counters, but the relative
   values could be equally determined by difference from the counter of
   the previous block of the same color.

       Table 1: Evaluation of counters for packet loss measurements

   As table shows, counters increase according to traffic coloring:
   during an A block (blocks 1, 3 and n+1) all the packets are A-colored
   therefore C(A) counter indicates the number of packets of that block,
   while C(B) counter is zero.  Viceversa, during a B block (blocks 2, 4
   and n) all the packets are B-colored therefore C(A) counter is zero,
   while C(B) counter indicates the number of packets of that block.

   When a block terminates (because the coloring has switched to the
   other color) the relative counters stop incrementing and it is
   possible to read them and compare the values measured on router R1
   and R2 thus determining any packet loss within that block.

   For example, looking at the table above, during the first block
   (A-colored) C(A)R1 and C(A)R2 have the same value (375) which
   corresponds to the exact number of packets of the first block.  Also
   during the second block (B-colored) R1 and R2 counters have the same
   value (388) which corresponds to the number of packets of the second
   block.  During blocks 3 and 4 on the other hand R1 and R2 counters
   are different meaning that some packet has been lost: precisely, 1
   packet (382-381) belonging to block 3 and 3 packets (377-374)
   belonging to block 4 were lost.

   The method here described for R1 and R2 can be extended to any router
   and applied to more complex networks, as far as the measurement is
   enabled on the path followed by the traffic flow being analyzed, thus
   providing a precise measurement of packet loss between any couple of
   network equipment.

3.2.  One-way Delay

   The principle used to measure packet loss can be applied to one-way
   delay measurement as well because the alternation of colors can be
   used as a reference to calculate the delay.  Whenever coloring
   changes (which means that a new block has started) a router stores
   the timestamp of the first packet of the block and the value can be
   compared with the timestamp of the same packet on a second router to
   compute packet delay.  Considering Figure 4, R1 stores a timestamp
   TS(A1)R1 when it sends the first packet of block 1 (A-colored), a
   timestamp TS(B2)R1 when it sends the first packet of block 2
   (B-colored) and so on for every other block.  R2 performs the same
   operation, recording TS(A1)R2, TS(B2)R2 and so on.  Since timestamps
   refer to specific packets (the first packet of each block) we are
   sure that timestamps compared to compute delay refer to the same
   packets.  By comparing TS(A1)R1 with TS(A1)R2 (and similarly TS(B2)R1
   with TS(B2)R2 and so on) it is possible to measure the delay between
   R1 and R2.  In order to have more measurements it may also be
   possible to take more timestamps, not only referring to the first
   packet of each block, but also its subsequent packets.  How
   timestamps are recorded when a particular packet is sent or received
   depends on the implementation and is out of the scope of this
   document.

   In order to coherently compare timestamps collected on different
   routers, synchronization is required in the network.  Furthermore, a
   measurement is valid if no packet loss occurs, otherwise the first
   packet of a block on R1 can be different from the first packet of the
   same block on R2 (f.i. if that packet is lost between R1 and R2).

   The following table shows how timestamps can be used to calculate the
   delay between R1 and R2.  The first column lists the sequence of
   traffic blocks while other columns contain the timestamp referring to
   the first packet of each block on R1 and R2.  Delay is computed as a
   difference between timestamps.  For sake of simplicity hours, minutes
   and seconds are omitted from timestamps and all the values are
   expressed in milliseconds.

          Table 2: Evaluation of timetamps for delay measurements

   The first row shows timestamps (in milliseconds) taken on R1 and R2
   respectively and referring to the first packet of block 1 (which is
   A-colored).  Delay can be computed as a difference between the
   timestamp on R1 and the timestamp on R2.  Similarly, the second row
   shows timestamps (in milliseconds) taken on R1 and R2 and referring
   to the first packet of block 2 (which is B-colored).  Comparing
   timestamps taken on different nodes in the network and referring to
   the same packets (identified using the alternation of colors) it is
   possible to measure delay on different network segments.

3.3.  Delay variation

   Similarly to one-way delay measurement, the method can be used to
   measure the inter-arrival jitter.  The alternation of colors can be
   used as a time reference to record timestamps and measure delay
   variations.  Considering the example depicted in Figure 4, R1 stores
   a timestamp TS(A)R1 whenever it sends the first packet of a block and
   R2 stores a timestamp TS(B)R2 whenever it receives the first packet
   of a block.  The inter-arrival jitter can be easily derived from one-
   way delay measurement.  For example, it is possible to evaluate the
   jitter calculating the delay variation on two consecutive samples.

4.  Implementation strategies

   The methodology described in the previous sections can be applied to
   different scenarios adopting different strategies.  Specifically, it
   can be used in two basic ways:

   o  flow-based: performance measurement is applied to specific flows
      for service monitoring purpose and can be end-to-end;

   o  link-based: performance measurement is applied to a particular
      link (physical or logical) and monitors all the flows of the link.

4.1.  Flow-based performance monitoring

   The flow-based strategy is used when only a limited number of traffic
   flows needs to be monitored.  This could be the case, for example, of
   IPTV channels or other specific applications traffic with high QoS
   requirements.

   According to this strategy, only a subset of the flows is colored.
   Counters for packet loss measurements can be instantiated for each
   single flow, or for the set as a whole, depending on the desired
   granularity.

   A relevant problem with this approach is the necessity to know in
   advance the path followed by flows that are subject to measurement.
   Path rerouting and traffic load-balancing increase the issue
   complexity, especially for unicast traffic.  The problem is easier to
   solve for multicast traffic where load balancing is seldom used,
   especially for IPTV traffic where static joins are frequently used to
   force traffic forwarding and replication.

4.2.  Link-based performance monitoring

   The link-based strategy is similar to performance monitoring tools
   usually used in transport networks, where the goal is to monitor the
   network behavior as a whole, without distinguishing among different
   services.

   Measurements are performed on all the traffic on a link.  The link
   could be a physical link or a logical link (for instance an Ethernet
   VLAN or a MPLS PW).  Counters can be instantiated for the traffic as
   a whole or for each traffic class (in case it is desired to monitor
   each class separately), but in the second case a couple of counters
   is needed for each class.

5.  Implementation hints

   This section describes, as an example, a practical implementation of
   the method and shows how the monitoring could be easily activated in
   a real network, without the need to activate any specific protocol,
   using instead basic features already available on major routing
   platforms.

5.1.  Traffic coloring

   Traffic coloring can be implemented setting a specific bit on the
   packet header and changing the value of that bit periodically.  For
   example it is possible to use the two less significant bits of the
   DSCP field (bit 0 and bit 1).  One of them (bit 0) is used to
   identify flows subject to traffic monitoring (and therefore it is
   always set to 1 on these flows), the other one (bit 1) changes
   periodically and is used to create traffic blocks assuming
   alternately values 0 and 1.  The choice of coloring traffic using the
   DSCP field implies that differentiated packet scheduling must not be
   based on that field but, for instance, only on IP Precedence bits.

   In practice, coloring traffic using the DSCP field can be performed
   configuring on the router interface an access list that intercepts
   the flow(s) to be monitored (or all the traffic in the link-based
   approach) and a policy that sets the DSCP field accordingly.  Since
   traffic coloring must change over time, it is necessary to modify the
   policy periodically: an automatic script can easily perform this
   task.

5.2.  Packet counting

   The operation of counting packets can be implemented very easily.  If
   traffic is colored using the DSCP field, an access list that matches
   specific DSCP values can be used to count packets of the flow being
   monitored.  The access list can also be configured to match different
   flow properties (such as source or destination address) besides the
   DSCP value, hence monitoring just a subset of the colored traffic.
   An important feature of this approach, in fact, is that coloring and
   counting are two decoupled operations: it is possible to color all
   the traffic, but monitor just one or few flows.

5.3.  Data collection

   In order to properly elaborate packet counters it is necessary to
   correlate values coming from different nodes.  If we cannot use any
   specific protocol to exchange this information among routers, it is
   possible to use an external system.  Its task is to collect data
   (counter values) from the network and make correlations to determine

   packet loss.  This operation can be done for instance transferring
   data to the external system via FTP or TFTP.

6.  Deployment considerations

   This section describes some aspects that should be taken into account
   when the method is deployed in a real network.

6.1.  Flow Identification

   In the previous section it was outlined that flow-based measurements
   require the identification of the flow to be monitored and the
   discovery of the path followed by the selected flow.  It is possible
   to monitor a single flow or multiple flows grouped together, but in
   this case measurement is consistent only if all the flows in the
   group follow the same path.  Moreover, a network operator must be
   aware that, if a measurement is performed on many flows, it is not
   possible to determine exactly which flow was affected by packets
   loss.

   Once the flow(s) to be monitored have been identified, it is
   important to enable the monitoring system in the proper nodes.  In
   order to have just an end-to-end monitoring it is sufficient to
   enable the monitoring system on the first and last hop routers of the
   path: the mechanism is completely transparent to intermediate nodes
   and independent from the path followed by traffic flows.  On the
   contrary, to monitor the flow along its whole path and on every
   segment (every node and link) it is necessary to enable the
   monitoring system on every node from the source to the destination.
   In case the exact path followed by the flow is not known a priori
   (i.e. the flow has multiple paths to reach the destination) it is
   necessary to enable the monitoring system on every path: counters on
   interfaces traversed by the flow will report packet count, counters
   on other interfaces will be null.

   In case the link-based strategy is used, flow identification is not
   necessary because all the traffic has to be colored and measured.

6.2.  Flow Coloring

   In both strategies, flow-based and link-based, the fundamental
   operation is to "color" the flow in order to create packet blocks.
   This means choosing where to activate the coloring and how to "color"
   packets.

   In case of flow-based measurements, it is desirable, in general, to
   have a single coloring node because it is simpler to manage and
   doesn't rise any risk of conflict (consider the case where two nodes
   color the same flow).  To this purpose it is necessary to color the
   flow as close as possible to the source.  In addition, coloring a
   flow close to the source allows an end-to-end measure if a



Tempia Bonda, et al.     Expires April 30, 2012                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft  Method for passive performance monitoring   October 2011


   measurement point is enabled on the last-hop router as well.  The
   only requirement is that coloring must change periodically and every
   node along the path must be able to identify unambiguously colored
   packets.

   For link-based measurements, all traffic needs to be colored when
   transmitted on the link.  If traffic had already been colored, then
   it has to be re-colored because the coloring must be consistent on
   the link.  This means that each hop along the path must (re-)color
   the traffic but coloring is not required to be consistent along
   different links.

6.3.  Monitoring Nodes

   In the previous section it was explained that, in case of flow-based
   measurement, the operation of coloring packets to be monitored can be
   accomplished by a single node.  All the intermediate nodes are not
   required to perform any particular operation except counting colored
   packets they receive and forward: this operation can be enabled on
   every router along the path or only on a subset, depending on which
   network segment is being monitored (a single link, a particular metro
   area, the backbone, the whole path).

   Since coloring changes periodically between two values, two counters
   (one for each value) are needed for a single flow being monitored:
   one counter for packets colored A and one counter for packets colored
   B.

   In case of link-based measurements the behavior is similar except
   that coloring and counting operations are performed on a link by link
   basis at each endpoint of the link itself.

   Another important aspect to take into consideration is when to read
   counters: in order to count the exact number of packets of a block
   routers must perform this operation when a block has terminated.  The
   task can be performed in two ways.  The most general approach
   suggests to read counters periodically, many times during a block,
   and to compare successive readings: when the counter stops
   incrementing means that the relative block has finished and its
   counter can be elaborated.  Alternatively, if coloring is performed
   based on a timer and the duration of the blocks is fixed and known,
   it is possible to synchronize counter collection with that timer
   (f.i. if each block is 5 minutes long it is possible to read counters
   every 5 minute in the middle of the block to overcome eventual time
   shifts from the router that colors traffic).

Internet-Draft  Method for passive performance monitoring   October 2011


6.4.  Management System

   Nodes enabled to perform performance monitoring collect the value of
   counters for colored packets, but they are not able to use this
   information to measure packet loss, because they only have local
   information and lack a global view of the network.  For this reason
   an external Network Management System (NMS) is required to collect
   and elaborate data and to perform packet loss calculation.  The NMS
   compares values of counters from different nodes and is then able to
   determine if some packets were lost (even a single packet) and also
   where packets were lost.

   Information collected by the routers (counter values) needs to be
   transferred to the NMS periodically.  This can be accomplished f.i.
   via FTP or TFTP and can be done in Push Mode or Polling Mode.  In the
   first case, each router sends periodically the information it
   collects to the NMS, in the latter case it is the NMS that
   periodically polls routers to collect information.

   If link-based measurement is used, it is also possible to use a
   protocol to exchange values of counters between the two endpoints in
   order to let them perform the packet loss calculation for each
   traffic direction.  A similar approach would be complicate if applied
   to a flow-based measurement.

6.5.  Scalability

   This section describes what is needed on a node in order to enable
   the performance measurement system to the purpose of understanding
   its scalability.

   The coloring can be easily performed on a single flow as well as on
   the entire traffic.  Regarding the counting, what is needed are two
   counters for every flow (or group of flows) being monitored and for
   every interface where the monitoring system is activated.  For
   example, in order to monitor separately 3 flows on a router with 4
   interfaces involved, 24 counters are needed (2 counters for each of
   the 3 flows on each of the 4 interfaces).

6.6.  Interoperability

   The method described in this document doesn't raise any
   interoperability issue, since it doesn't require any new protocol or
   any kind of interaction among nodes.  Traffic coloring can be
   performed by a single node, while counting of packets is performed
   locally by each router and the correlation between counters can be
   done by an external NMS which collects and correlates the data coming
   from the network.

   The only requirement is that every node should be able to identify
   colored flows, but, as explained in Section 5, this can be
   accomplished using simple functionalities that doesn't have any
   interoperability issue and are already available on major routing
   platforms.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a method to perform measurements in the
   context of a Service Provider's network and has not been developed to
   conduct Internet measurements, so it does not directly affect
   Internet security nor applications which run on the Internet.
   However, implementation of this method must be mindful of security
   and privacy concerns.

   There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by
   the measurements and potential harm to the measurements.  For what
   concerns the first point, the measurements described in this document
   are passive, so there are no packets injected into the network
   causing potential harm to the network itself and to data traffic.
   Nevertheless, the method implies modifications on the fly to the IP
   header of data packets: this must be performed in a way that doesn't
   alter the quality of service experienced by packets subject to
   measurements and that preserve stability and performance of routers
   doing the measurements.  The measurements themselves could be harmed
   by routers altering the coloring of the packets, or by an attacker
   injecting artificial traffic.  Authentication techniques, such as
   digital signatures, may be used where appropriate to guard against
   injected traffic attacks.

   The privacy concerns of network measurement are limited because the
   method only relies on information contained in the IP header without
   any release of user data.
