Internet-Draft          NVGRE/VXLAN for L3VPN Extension   November 2012

Abstract

   This document specifies NVGRE and VXLAN encapsulation for L3VPN
   Extension. Both NVGRE and VXLAN are originally designed for L2
   overlay. The draft proposes the enhancement on both to allow L3
   overlay completely decoupled from the L2 overlay in terms of
   encoding schema and data processing.

Internet-Draft          NVGRE/VXLAN for L3VPN Extension   November 2012


1. Introduction

   L3VPN Extension [ESRQMT] requires that a BGP based L3VPN [RFC4364]
   is able to expand to the end systems in a DC, i.e. to a server where
   Guest OS and Host OS/Hypervisor reside. This implies that the CE and
   PE components in the L3VPN architecture may reside on a same device.
   To complement current practical server implementations, the L3VPN
   Extension further proposes utilizing NVGRE [NVGRE] and/or VXLAN
   [VXLAN] data encapsulation formats [DRAO]. The approach brings the
   advantage to use a unified solution for both L2 overlay [SALI]
   [DRAKE] and L3 overlay services. However, both NVGRE and VXLAN are
   originally designed as a L2 overlay data encapsulation in which the
   inner header MUST be an Ethernet header.

   This document proposes an enhancement to NVGRE and VXLAN
   encapsulation formats that allow them to be used as the same data
   encapsulation semantics for both L2 overlay and L3 overlay services.
   The benefits of this usage include maintaining L3VPN natively and
   decoupling it from the L2 overlay completely.

2. NVGRE and VXLAN Encapsulation for L3VPN Extension

   A BGP/MPLS L3VPN [RFC4364] requires that the inner header is IP
   header, either IPv4 or IPv6. Both NVGRE [NVGRE] and VXLAN [VXLAN]
   encapsulation schema require that the inner header MUST be an
   Ethernet header. The solution of [DRAO] suggests several options to
   fill the MAC address fields when using NVGER and/or VXLAN in a BGP
   based L3VPN, although inner Ethernet address is not relevant to the
   L3VPN mechanism. These options make L3 overlay still coupled with L2
   overlay one way or another, which does not meet the requirement of
   L3VPN Extension [ESRQMT].

  2.1. NVGRE Enhancement for L3VPN Extension

   NVGER [NVGRE] leverages the GRE protocol [RFC2890] and specifies
   that the protocol type field in the GRE header MUST be filled with
   the value of 0x6558, which means for Transparent Ethernet.

   This draft proposes to allow the protocol type field to be either
   the value of 0x6558 or 0x0800. The value 0x0800 means IP payload
   [RFC3232]. The value 0x6558 MUST be used if the inner header is
   Ethernet header. The value 0x0800 MUST be used if the inner header
   is IP header. Furthermore, the version field in IP header indicates
   if the IP header is IPv4 or IPv6. When L3VPN Extension uses NVGRE
   encapsulation, it MUST use the value of 0x0800 in the protocol type

   field and encode IP header as the inner header. Other fields in the
   outer header of the NVGRE remain the same.

  2.2. VXLAN Enhancement for L3VPN Extension

   This document proposes adding a protocol type field in the VXLAN
   header as indicated below. It takes 16 bits from the reserved 24
   bits as the protocol type field. For L2 overlay encapsulation, the
   protocol type field MUST be filled with the value of 0x6558. For L3
   overlay encapsulation, the protocol type field MUST be filled with
   the value of 0x0800, which means IP header [RFC3232]; inner header
   MUST be IP header as shown below. The remained 8 reserved bit MUST
   be filled with zero.

Internet-Draft          NVGRE/VXLAN for L3VPN Extension   November 2012

   When L3VPN Extension uses VXLAN encapsulation, it MUST use the value
   of 0x0800 in the protocol type field and encode IP header as the
   inner header. Other fields in the outer header and the VXLAN header
   remain the same.

   For an L2 overlay, the protocol type value MUST be 0x6558, and inner
   header MUST be Ethernet header and use the same format as in [VXLAN].

   Another option to achieve this is to use one or more of reserved
   bits to indicate inner header type. For example, use the bit 6 in
   the VLAN header. However, this option has limited space for future
   expansion and makes NVGRE and VXLAN use of different semantics to
   indicate inner header.

  2.3. Benefits

   The enhancement on NVGRE and VXLAN encapsulation formats brings some
   beneficial for L3VPN Extension to use NVGRE and/or VXLAN as a data
   encapsulation format:

   o  Maintain L3VPN implementation natively and decouple it completely
      from L2 overlay implementation.

   o  Extend VXLAN and NVGRE encapsulation formats to support seamless
      L2 and L3 overlay interworking [E-IP-VPN].

   o  BGP control plane works consistently with the data plane in term
      of multiple protocol support, i.e. the inner header on a data
      packet matches the address family being advertised by BGP route
      UPDATE message.

   o  Save 12 bytes in every packet in a native L3 overlay and lower
      the probability of the packet fragmentation due to a shorter
      inner header for the L3 overlay.

   It is worth mention that the protocol extension in this document
   does not impact any mechanism that is specified in NVGRE [NVGRE] and
   VXLAN [VXLAN].

3. Security Considerations

   The mechanism proposed in this document does not add any additional
   security concern beside what has been described in the NVGRE [NVGRE]
   and VXLAN [VXLAN].
