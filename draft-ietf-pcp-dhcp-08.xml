    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6) options to configure
      hosts with Port Control Protocol (PCP) Server IP addresses. The use of
      DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment scenario.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and
      DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> options that can be used to
      provision PCP server <xref target="RFC6887"></xref> IP addresses.</t>

      <t>This specification assumes a PCP server is reachable with one or
      multiple IP addresses. As such, a list of IP addresses can be returned
      in the PCP server DHCP option.</t>

      <t>This specification allows to return one or multiple instances of the
      PCP server DHCP option. This is used as a hint to guide the PCP client
      whether it needs to send PCP requests to one or multiple PCP
      servers.</t>

      <t>When multiple instances of the PCP server DHCP option or multiple IP
      addresses are received from the DHCP server, the PCP client follows the
      behavior specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcp-server-selection"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The use of DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment
      scenarios.</t>

      <section title="Client Behavior">
        <t>To discover a PCP server <xref target="RFC6887"></xref>, the DHCPv6
        client MUST include an Option Request Option (ORO) requesting the
        DHCPv6 PCP server option as described in Section 22.7 of <xref
        target="RFC3315"></xref> (i.e., include OPTION_PCP_SERVER on its
        OPTION_ORO).</t>

        <t>The client MUST be prepared to receive multiple instances of the
        DHCPv6 PCP server option; each instance is treated as a separate PCP
        server.</t>

        <t>The client MUST be prepared to receive one or multiple IPv6
        addresses in the same PCP server option.</t>

        <t>If an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address is received in an OPTION_PCP_SERVER
        option, the PCP client issues IPv4 PCP messages to that PCP server.
        This behavior is compliant with the behavior of Windows and Mac OS as
        reported in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC6052"></xref>. </t>

        <t>When multiple instances of the PCP server DHCPv6 option or multiple

    <section title="Configuration Guidelines (Server Side)">
      <t>DHCP servers supporting the DHCP PCP server option can be configured
      with a list of IP addresses of the PCP server(s). If multiple IP
      addresses are configured, the DHCP server should be explicitly
      configured whether all or some of these addresses refer to:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>the same PCP server: the DHCP server returns multiple addresses
          in the same instance of the DHCP PCP server option.</t>

          <t>distinct PCP servers: the DHCP server returns multiple instances
          of the DHCP PCP server option to the requesting client; each
          instance is referring to a distinct PCP server. For example,
          multiple OPTION_PCP_SERVER instances may be configured to a PCP
          client in some deployment contexts such as multi-homing. It is out
          of scope of this document to enumerate all deployment scenarios that
          require multiple OPTION_PCP_SERVER instances to be returned.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The DHCP server may be configured with one or multiple FQDNs of the
      PCP server(s). In such case, the DHCP server must resolve these FQDNs
      into one or a list of IP addresses from pre-configured DNS server(s). If
      multiple FQDNs are configured to the DHCP server, the DHCP server must
      include multiple OPTION_PCP_SERVER instances; each of them carries one
      or a list of IP addresses that resulted from the FQDN resolution. DHCPv4
      servers supporting PCP server option must resolve any configured FQDN
      into an IPv4 address while DHCPv6 servers may resolve any configured
      FQDN into an IPv6 and/or IPv4 address. If an IPv4 address is retrieved
      by the DHCPv6 server, the corresponding IPv4-mapped IPv6 address is
      included in the OPTION_PCP_SERVER DHPCv6 option. If both IPv4 and IPv6
      addresses are retrieved by the DHCPv6 server, these addresses are
      included in the same OPTION_PCP_SERVER DHPCv6 option (IPv4 addresses are
      represented as IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses).<list style="empty">
          <t>Discussion: The motivation for this design is to accommodate
          deployment cases where an IPv4 connectivity service is provided
          while only DHPCv6 is in use (e.g., an IPv4-only PCP server in a
          DS-Lite context <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>For guidelines on providing context-specific configuration
      information (e.g., returning a regional-based configuration), and
      information on how a server might be configured with FQDNs that get
      resolved on demand, see <xref
