    	<t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) as the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between PCEs, enabling computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).</t> 
    	<t><xref target="STATEFUL-PCE"/> specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of LSPs in compliance with <xref target="RFC4655"/>. It includes mechanisms for LSP state synchronization between a PCC and a PCE.</t>
    	<t>This document specifies the mechanisms of LSP-DB synchronization between stateful PCEs in the same domain.</t>

    <section title="Motivation & Use" toc="default">
    <t>"Distributed computation model" (<xref target="RFC4655"/>) refers to a domain or network that may include multiple PCEs where computation of paths is shared among the PCEs, this is further clarified in <xref target="PCE-QUESTIONS"/>.</t>
    <t>When multiple stateful PCEs are operating in the network, they could be either - </t>
    <t>
        <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Primary or Backup PCE:">A backup PCE exists to perform functions in the network, only in the event of a failure of the primary PCE. In this case, all LSPs to be delegated are under primary stateful PCE control while other PCEs in the domain act as backup. The backup PCE should have the same view of LSP-DB as primary stateful PCE. The LSP-DB of a backup PCE can be synchronized via the primary stateful PCE or collected from multiple network nodes (PCC). In case of latter, the backup PCE may face synchronization issues as described in <xref target="PCE-QUESTIONS"/>. Thus it is suggested that backup PCE can be synchronized via the primary stateful PCE, this mechanism is described in <xref target="SEC_PB"/>.</t>
        <t hangText="Load-Balanced PCE:">Load-Balanced PCEs share the computation load all the time. One PCE MAY serve a set of PCCs as the primary computation server, and only addresses requests from other PCCs in the event of the failure of some other PCE. Delegated LSPs are thus distributed among stateful PCEs. It is suggested that in this case each load-balanced stateful PCE should build their LSP-DB independently from the network (PCCs) (via mechanism described in <xref target="STATEFUL-PCE"/>) during initial LSP state synchronization and not from other stateful PCEs. But it is important that these load-balanced stateful PCEs needs to be synchronized to have a similar view of pending LSPs and sticky resources, this mechanism is described in <xref target="SEC_PP"/>.</t>

    <t><xref target="STATEFUL-PCE"/> specifies new functions to support a stateful PCE. It also specifies that a function can be initiated either from a PCC towards a PCE (C-E) or from a PCE towards a PCC (E-C).</t>

    <t>LSP-DB synchronization function is defined in section 5.4 of <xref target="STATEFUL-PCE"/> between PCC and PCEs. This document extends the LSP state synchronization between stateful PCEs.</t>

        <t>As shown in <xref target="FIG_1"/>, PCE1 is the primary stateful PCE and PCE2 is the backup stateful PCE. PCC1 and PCC2 synchronize the LSP-DB with the primary stateful PCE1 after session initialization phase. And primary stateful PCE1 synchronizes LSP-DB with its backup stateful PCE2 after session initialization phase. This is LSP state synchronization as described in <xref target="SEC_F"/> and uses PCRpt message.</t>
        <t>PCC1 & PCC2 delegates LSP1 & LSP2 to the primary PCE1. Whenever there is an update in LSP, PCE1 sends a PCUpd message to corresponding PCC and also to backup PCE2. This is LSP update request as described in <xref target="SEC_F"/> and uses PCUpd message. This makes sure that the pending LSP changes and sticky resources are backed up. The PCC sends a PCRpt message to the primary PCE, indicating the LSP's status, the primary PCE further synchronizes the state with backup PCEs via PCRpt message.</t>

      <t>In this case LSP state synchronization (backup) is done via primary stateful PCE. The backup PCE is used only in case the primary PCE fails. The backup PCE SHOULD trust the LSP state as sent by the primary and MAY choose to ignore any state learned from the network (PCCs).</t>
      <t>At the time of failure of primary PCE (PCE1), the backup PCE (PCE2) act as a primary.  In case of multiple backup PCEs, a selection mechanism (e.g. least IP address among backup PCEs) may be used. When PCE1 recovers from failure, the acting primary PCE (PCE2) should backup using the mechanism as described in this section and restart all its PCEP sessions, thus making sure all PCEP speakers now considers PCE1 as primary.</t>
