Abstract

   This document presents a topology-transparent zone in a domain.  A
   topology-transparent zone comprises a group of routers and a number
   of links connecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone is
   not aware of the zone.  The information about the links and routers
   inside the zone is not distributed to any router outside of the zone.
   Any link state change such as a link down inside the zone is not seen
   by any router outside of the zone.

Internet-Draft          Topology-Transparent Zone               May 2013


1.  Introduction

   The number of routers in an Autonomous System (AS) becomes larger and
   larger as the Internet traffic keeps growing.  Thus the Open Shortest
   Path First (OSPF) Link State Database (LSDB) and OSPF routing table
   are bigger and bigger.  Any link state change in an AS leads to a
   number of link state distributions to every router in the AS.  This
   triggers every router in the AS to re-calculate its OSPF routes,
   update its Routing Information Base (RIB) and Forwarding Information
   Base (FIB).  All these will consume network resource including
   network bandwidth and Central Process Unit (CPU) time.  This blocks
   further expansions of a network.

   RFC 2328 "OSPF Version 2" describes OSPF areas in an AS.  Each area
   has a number of area border routers connected to the backbone area.
   Each area border router summarizes the topology of its attached non
   backbone areas for transmission on the backbone, and hence to all
   other area border routers.

   Through splitting a network into multiple areas, we can extend the
   network further.  However, there are a number of issues when a
   network is split further into more areas.

   At first, dividing an AS or an area into multiple areas is a very
   challenging task since it is involved in significant network
   architecture changes.

   Secondly, it is complex for a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switching Path (LSP) crossing multiple
   areas to be setup.  In general, a TE path crossing multiple areas is
   computed by using collaborating Path Computation Elements (PCEs)
   [RFC5441] through the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP)[RFC5440],
   which is not easy to configure by operators since the manual
   configuration of the sequence of domains is required.  Although this
   issue can be addressed by using the Hierarchical PCE, this solution
   may further increase the complexity of network design.  Especially,
   the current PCE standard method may not guarantee that the path found
   is optimal.

   Thirdly, some policies need to be configured on area border routers
   for reducing the number of link states such as summary Link-State
   Advertisements (LSAs) to be distributed to other routers in other
   areas.

   Furthermore, route convergence may be slower.  A router in an OSPF
   area can see all other routers in the same area.  A link-state change
   anywhere in an OSPF area will be populated everywhere in the same
   area, and may even be distributed to other areas in the same AS

   indirectly.  For example, all the routers and links in a Point-Of-
   Presence (POP) in an OSPF area will be seen by all the other routers
   in the same area.  Any link state change in the POP will be
   distributed to all the other routers in the same area and may be
   distributed to routers in other areas indirectly.

   A link state change in an area will lead to every router in the same
   area to re-calculate its OSPF routes, update its RIB and FIB.  It may
   also lead to a number of link state distributions to other areas.
   This will trigger routers in other areas to re-calculate their OSPF
   routes, update their RIBs and FIBs.  Thus the route convergence is
   slower.

   This document presents a topology-transparent zone in a domain or an
   area and describes extensions to OSPF for supporting the topology-
   transparent zone, which may resolve the issues above.

   A topology-transparent zone comprises a group of routers and a number
   of links connecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone is
   not aware of the zone.  The information about the links and routers
   inside the zone is not distributed to any router outside of the zone.
   Any link state change such as a link down inside the zone is not seen
   by any router outside of the zone.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


3.  Requirements

   Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) may be deployed for resolving some
   ctricial issues such as scalability in existing networks and future
   networks.  The requirements for TTZ are listed as follows:

   o  TTZ MUST be backward compitable.  When a TTZ is deployed on a set
      of routers in a network, the routers outside of the TTZ in the
      network do not need to know or support TTZ.

   o  TTZ MUST support at least one more levels of network hierarchies,
      in addition to the hierarchies supported by existing routing
      protocols.

   o  Users SHOULD be able to easily set up an end to end service
      crossing TTZs.

   o  The configuration for a TTZ in a network SHOULD be minimum.

   o  The changes on the existing protocols for supporting TTZ SHOULD be
      minimum.


4.  Topology-Transparent Zone

4.1.  Overview of Topology-Transparent Zone

   A Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) is identified by an Identifier
   (ID), and it includes a group of routers and a number of links
   connecting the routers.  A Topology-Transparent Zone is in an OSPF
   domain.

   The ID of a Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) or TTZ ID is a number
   that is unique for identifying an entity such as a node in an OSPF
   domain.  It is not zero in general.

   In addition to having the functions of an OSPF area, an OSPF TTZ
   makes some improvements on an OSPF area, which include:

   o  An OSPF TTZ is virtualized as a group of TTZ edge routers
      connected.

   o  An OSPF TTZ receives the link state information about the topology
      outside of the TTZ, stores the information in the TTZ and floods
      the information through the TTZ to the routers outside of TTZ.

   o  No Policy configuration is needed on any edge router of a TTZ.

                        Figure 1: An Example of TTZ

   The routing domain comprises routers R15, R17, R23, R25, R29 and R31.
   It also contains a topology-transparent zone TTZ 600.  The TTZ 600
   comprises routers R61, R63, R65, R67, R71 and R73, and the links
   connecting them.

   There are two types of routers in a Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ):
   TTZ internal routers and TTZ edge routers.  A TTZ internal router is
   a router inside the TTZ and every adjacent router of the TTZ internal
   router is a router inside the TTZ.  A TTZ edge router is a router

   inside the TTZ and has at least one adjacent router that is outside
   of the TTZ.

   The TTZ in the figure above comprises four TTZ edge routers R61, R63,
   R65 and R67.  Each TTZ edge router is connected to at least one
   router outside of the TTZ.  For instance, router R61 is a TTZ edge
   router since it is connected to router R15, which is outside of the
   TTZ.

   In addition, the TTZ comprises two TTZ internal routers R71 and R73.
   A TTZ internal router is not connected to any router outside of the
   TTZ.  For instance, router R71 is a TTZ internal router since it is
   not connected to any router outside of the TTZ.  It is just connected
   to routers R61, R63, R65, R67 and R73 inside the TTZ.

   A TTZ MUST hide the information inside the TTZ from the outside.  It
   MUST NOT directly distribute any internal information about the TTZ
   to a router outside of the TTZ.

   For instance, the TTZ in the figure above MUST NOT send the
   information about TTZ internal router R71 to any router outside of
   the TTZ in the routing domain; it MUST NOT send the information about
   the link between TTZ router R61 and R65 to any router outside of the
   TTZ.

   In order to create a Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ), we MUST
   configure the same TTZ ID on the edge routers and identify the TTZ
   internal links on them.  In addition, we SHOULD confiure the TTZ ID
   on every TTZ internal router which indicates that every link of the
   router is a TTZ internal link.

   From a router outside of the TTZ, a TTZ is seen as a group of routers
   fully connected.  For instance, router R15 in the figure above, which
   is outside of TTZ 600, sees TTZ 600 as a group of TTZ edge routers:
   R61, R63, R65 and R67.  These four TTZ edge routers are fully
   connected.

   In addition, a router outside of the TTZ sees TTZ edge routers having
   normal connections to the routers outside of the TTZ.  For example,
   router R15 sees four TTZ edge routers R61, R63, R65 and R67, which
   have the normal connections to R15, R29, R17 and R23, R25 and R31
   respectively.


5.  Changes to OSPF Protocols

   There are a number of ways to extend the existing OSPF protocol to
   support TTZ.  This section describes a couple of them.

   o  One way is to use one bit to indicate that a link is a TTZ link in
      a router LSA.

   o  Another option is to have a TLV in a Router Information LSA
      containing TTZ ID and flags to indicate that the router is a TTZ
      edge router or a TTZ internal router.

5.1.  One Bit to Indicate an Internal TTZ Link

   A router LSA contains the description of a number of router links.
   The existing format of a router LSA is illustrated as follows:

   For a router link, the value of an eight bit Type field indicates the
   kind of the link.  The value of the Type field may be 1, 2, 3 or 4,

   which indicates that the kind of the link is a point-to-point
   connection to another router, a connection to a transit network, a
   connection to a stub network, or a virtual link respectively.

   The existing eight bit Type field for a router link may be split into
   two fields as follows:

         1: This indicates that the router link is an internal link
            to a router inside the TTZ.

         0: This indicates that the router link is an external link.


       Type-1:

         The kind of the link.


                Figure 3: Bit to Indicate Internal TTZ Link

   For a link inside a TTZ, the value of I bit flag is set to one,
   indicating that this link is an internal TTZ link.  For a link
   connecting to a router outside of a TTZ from a TTZ edge router, the
   value of I bit flag is set to zero, indicating that this link is an
   external TTZ link.

   The value of Type-1 field may have value 1, 2, 3, or 4, which
   indicates that the kind of a link being described is a point-to-point
   connection to another router, a connection to a transit network, a
   connection to a stub network, or a virtual link respectively.

5.2.  A TTZ TLV in Router Information LSA

   A new TLV is proposed in Router Information LSA for TTZ in the figure
   below to indicate a router's TTZ capability and the TTZ to which the
   router belongs.

                Figure 4: TTZ TLV in Router Information LSA

   The TTZ TLV follows the Router Informational Capabilities TLV in a
   Router Information LSA.  Every edge router of a TTZ generates a
   Router Information LSA containing a TTZ TLV with E bit set to 1 and
   the ID of the TTZ.  Each internal router of the TTZ originates a
   Router Information LSA containing a TTZ TLV with E bit set to 0 and
   the ID of the TTZ.

   A TTZ is defined by all the routers with the same TTZ ID and all the
   TTZ links.  For a TTZ edge router, its links connected to other TTZ
   routers belong to the TTZ.  For a TTZ internal router, all its links
   belong to the TTZ.


6.  Constructing Router LSA

   Two types of router LSAs are generated by an edge router of a TTZ.
   The first type describes the links connecting to it; in fact, this
   LSA is the "normal" LSA that would be constructed if the TTZ feature
   is not used.  This LSA is also generated by a router inside the TTZ.
   The second is generated to virtualize the TTZ as a group of edge
   routers connected.

   The first type of LSA comprises both the router links connecting the



Chen, et al.            Expires November 5, 2013               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          Topology-Transparent Zone               May 2013


   routers inside the TTZ and the router links connecting to the routers
   outside of the TTZ.  For each of the router links in the LSA, it can
   be represented in one of the ways described in the previous section.

   The second router LSA generated by an edge router of the TTZ
   comprises two groups of links in general.

   The first group of links are the router links connecting the routers
   outside of the TTZ from this TTZ edge router.  These router links are
   normal router links.  There is a router link for every adjacency
   between this TTZ edge router and a router outside of the TTZ.

   The second group of links are the "virtual" router links.  For each
   of the other TTZ edge routers, there is a "virtual" router link to it
   from this TTZ edge router.  The cost of the router link from this TTZ
   router to one of the other TTZ edge routers may be the cost of the
   shortest path from this TTZ edge router to it.

   In addition, the LSA may contain a third group of links, which are
   stub links for other destinations inside the TTZ.


7.  Establishing Adjacencies

   A router in a TTZ forms an adjacency with another router in the TTZ
   in the same way as a normal router when these two routers have a
   connection.

   For an edge router in a TTZ, it also forms an adjacency with any
   router outside of the TTZ that has a connection with the edge router.

   When the edge router synchronizes its link state database with the
   router outside of the TTZ, it sends the router outside of the TTZ the
   information about all the LSAs except for the LSAs belonging to the
   TTZ that are hidden from any router outside of the TTZ.

   At the end of the link state database synchronization, the edge
   router originates its own router LSA for virtualizing the TTZ and
   sends this LSA to the router outside of the TTZ.

   From the point of view of the router outside of the TTZ, it sees the
   other end as a normal router and forms the adjacency in the same way
   as a normal router.  It is not aware of anything about its
   neighboring TTZ.  From the LSAs related to the TTZ edge router in the
   other end, it knows that the TTZ edge router is connected to each of
   the other TTZ edge routers and some routers outside of the TTZ.

8.  Distribution of LSAs

   LSAs can be divided into three classes according to their
   distributions.  The first class of LSAs is distributed within a TTZ.
   The second is distributed through a TTZ.  The third is distributed
   only to the edge routers of the TTZ.

8.1.  Distribution of LSAs within TTZ

   Any LSA about a link state in a TTZ is distributed within the TTZ.
   It will not be distributed to any router outside of the TTZ.

   For example, any router LSA generated for a router in a TTZ is
   distributed within the TTZ.  It will not be distributed to any router
   outside of the TTZ.

   Any network LSA generated for a broadcast or NBMA network inside a
   TTZ is distributed within the TTZ.  It will not be distributed to any
   router outside of the TTZ.

   Any opaque LSA generated for a TTZ internal TE link is distributed
   within the TTZ.  It will not be distributed to any router outside of
   the TTZ.

8.2.  Distribution of LSAs through TTZ

   Any LSA about a link state outside of a TTZ received by an edge
   router of the TTZ is distributed through the TTZ.

   For example, when an edge router of a TTZ receives an LSA for a link
   state outside of the TTZ from a router outside of the TTZ, it floods
   it to its neighboring routers both inside the TTZ and outside of the
   TTZ.  This LSA may be any LSA such as a router LSA and an opaque LSA
   that is distributed in a domain.

   The routers in the TTZ continue to flood the LSA.  When another edge
   router of the TTZ receives the LSA, it floods the LSA to its
   neighboring routers both outside of the TTZ and inside the TTZ.

8.3.  Distribution of LSAs only to Edges of TTZ

   In the case that a TTZ is virtualized as a group of edge routers of
   the TTZ connected, every edge router of the TTZ generates a router
   LSA for the TTZ.  This LSA is distributed to the routers outside of
   the TTZ but not to the TTZ internal routers.

   When an edge router of the TTZ receives a router LSA originated by
   another edge router of the TTZ for virtualizing the TTZ, it floods



Chen, et al.            Expires November 5, 2013               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          Topology-Transparent Zone               May 2013


   the LSA to its neighboring routers outside of the TTZ but not to the
   TTZ internal routers.


9.  Computation of Routing Table

   The computation of the routing table on a router is the same as that
   described in RFC 2328, with one exception.  An edge router of a TTZ
   MUST ignore the router LSAs generated by the edge routers of the TTZ
   for virtualizing the TTZ.


10.  Smooth Migration to TTZ

   This section describes the mechanisms which allow users to make a
   smooth migration to the TTZ with minimum interruption to the network.

   For a group of routers and a number of links connecting the routers
   in an area, making them to work as a TTZ eventually with minimum
   interruption to the network may take a few of steps or stages.

   At first, users configure the TTZ feature on every router in the TTZ.
   In this stage, the router has dual roles.  One role is to function as
   a normal router.  The other is to generate and distribute some TTZ
   information among the routers in the TTZ.

   Secondly, users may allow every router in the TTZ to work as a TTZ
   router after they determine that every router in the TTZ is ready for
   transferring to work as a TTZ router eventually.  For a router in the
   TTZ, users may allow it to work as a TTZ router after it has received
   all the necessary information from all the routers in the TTZ.  This
   information may be displayed on a router through a CLI command.

   And then users may activate the TTZ.  There are a few of ways to
   activate the TTZ.  One way is to activate it on a TTZ router through
   a CLI command such as activate TTZ directly.  Another is through a
   TTZ activate timer, which activates the TTZ once the timer expires.

   After a TTZ router is requested to activate the TTZ, it transfers to
   work as a TTZ router.  When a TTZ router receives a LSA for
   virtualizing the TTZ and it is allowed to work as a TTZ router, it
   also transfers to work as a TTZ router.  Thus, after every router in
   a TTZ is allowed to work as a TTZ router, activating the TTZ on one
   TTZ router will make every router in the TTZ transfer to work as a
   TTZ router.

   For an edge router of the TTZ, transferring to work as a TTZ router
   comprises flushing its LSA originated for its link state as a normal

   router as needed, generating a router LSA to virtualize the TTZ and
   flooding this LSA to all its neighboring routers except for the TTZ
   internal routers.


11.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document does not raise any new
   security issues for the OSPF protocols.


12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to assign a TLV in the OSPF Router Informational LSA,
   as described in Section 5.
