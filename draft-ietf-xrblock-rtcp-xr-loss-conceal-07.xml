    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines two RTCP XR Report Blocks that allows the
      reporting of concealment metrics for audio applications of RTP.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <section title="Loss Concealment and Concealment Seconds Metrics Reporting Block">
        <t>At any instant, the audio output at a receiver may be classified as
        either 'normal' or 'concealed'. 'Normal' refers to playout of audio
        payload received from the remote end, and also includes locally
        generated signals such as announcements, tones and comfort noise.
        Concealment refers to playout of locally-generated signals used to
        mask the impact of network impairments or to reduce the audibility of
        jitter buffer adaptations.</t>

        <t>This draft defines two new concealment related block types to
        augment those defined in [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP
        applications. These two block types extend packet loss concealment
        mechanism defined in section 4.7.6 of RFC3611.</t>

        <t>The first block type provides metrics for actions taken by the
        receiver to mitigate the effect of packet loss and packet discard.
        Specifically, the first metric (On-Time Playout Duration) reports the
        duration of normal playout of data which the receiver obtained from
        the sender's stream. A second metric (Loss Concealment Duration)
        reports the total time during which the receiver played out media data
        which was manufactured locally, because the sender's data for these
        periods was not available due to packet loss or discard. A similar
        metric (Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration) reports the duration
        of playout of locally-manufactured data replacing data which is
        unavailable due to adaptation of an adaptive de-jitter buffer. Further
        metrics (Playout Interrupt Count and Mean Playout Interrupt Size)
        report the number of times normal playout was interrupted, and the
        mean duration of these interruptions.</t>

        <t>Loss Concealment Duration and Buffer Adjustment Concealment
        Duration are reported separately because buffer adjustment is
        typically arranged to occur in silence periods so may have very little
        impact on user experience, whilst loss concealment may occur at any
        time.</t>

        <t>The second block type provides metrics for concealment seconds,
        which are measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream.
        Specifically, the first metric (Unimpaired Seconds) reports the number
        of whole seconds occupied only with normal playout of data which the
        receiver obtained from the sender's stream. The second metric
        (Concealed Seconds) reports the number of whole seconds during which
        the receiver played out any locally-generated media data. A third
        metric (Severely Concealed Seconds) reports the number of whole
        seconds during which the receiver played out locally-generated data
        for more than SCS Threshold.</t>

        <t>These metrics belongs to the class of transport-related terminal
        metrics defined in <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defined an
        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This draft defines a new Extended Report block that MUST be used as
        defined in <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Architectures <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref> provides guideline for reporting block format
        using RTCP XR. The Metrics Block described in this document are in
        accordance with those guidelines.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>These metrics are applicable to audio applications of RTP and the
        audio component of Audio/Video applications in which the packet loss
        concealment machinery is contained at the receiving end to mitigate
        the impact of network impairments to user's perception of media
        quality.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <section title="Standards Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Notations">
        <t>This report block makes use of binary fractions. The terminology
        used is <list>
            <t>Numeric formats S X:Y<list>
                <t>where S indicates a two's complement signed representation,
                X the number of bits prior to the decimal place and Y the
                number of bits after the decimal place.</t>

                <t>Hence 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0 to
                255.996 with a granularity of 0.0039. S7:8 would represent the
                range -127.996 to +127.996. 0:16 represents a proper binary
                fraction with range</t>

                <t>0.0 to 1 - 1/65536 = 0.9999847</t>

                <t>though note that use of flag values at the top of the
                numeric range slightly reduces this upper limit. For example,
                if the 16- bit values 0xfffe and 0xffff are used as flags for
                "over-range" and "unavailable" conditions, a 0:16 quantity has
                range</t>

                <t>0.0 to 1 - 3/65536 = 0.9999542</t>
              </list></t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Loss Concealment Block">
      <t>The metrics block described here are intended to be used as described
      in this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
      Information block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref>. Instances of this
      Metrics Block refer by Synchronization source (SSRC) to the separate
      auxiliary Measurement Information block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref>
      which describes measurement periods in use (see <xref
      target="RFC6776"></xref> section 4.2). This Metrics Block relies on the
      measurement period in the Measurement Information block indicating the
      span of the report and SHOULD be sent in the same compound RTCP packet
      as the measurement information block. If the measurement period is not
      received in the same compound RTCP packet as this Metrics Block, this
      metrics block MUST be discarded.</t>

            <t hangText="Block type (BT): 8 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />A
            Loss Concealment Metrics Report Block is identified by the
            constant NLC. <vspace blankLines="1" />[Note to RFC Editor: please
            replace NLC with the IANA provided RTCP XR block type for this
            block.] <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />This field is used to indicate whether the Loss
            Concealment metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics:
            <list>
                <t>I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
                most recent measurement interval duration between successive
                metrics reports.</t>

                <t>I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to
                the accumulation period characteristic of cumulative
                measurements.</t>

                <t>I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
                instantaneous value.</t>
              </list><vspace blankLines="1" />In this document, Loss
            Concealment Metrics can only be measured over definite intervals,
            and cannot be sampled. Also, the value I=00 is reserved for future
            use. Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00 or I=01. If a block is
            received with I=00 or I=01, the receiver MUST discard the block.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Packet Loss Concealment Method (plc): 2 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />This field is used to identify the packet loss
            concealment method in use at the receiver, according to the
            following code: <list>
                <t>bits 014-015<list>
                    <t>0 = silence insertion</t>

                    <t>2 = simple replay, with attenuation</t>

                    <t>3 = enhancement</t>

                  </list><vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
              </list>Note that the enhancement method (plc =3 )for packet loss
            concealment offers an improved audio quality and or a better
            robustness against packet losses [G.711] and is equivalent to
            enhanced in section 4.7.1 of [RFC3611],<vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Reserved (resv): 4 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />These bits are reserved. They MUST be set to zero
            by senders and ignored by receivers (See <xref
            target="RFC6709"></xref> section 4.2). <vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="block length: 16 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" /> The
            length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one. For the
            Loss Concealment Block, the block length is equal to 5.<vspace

            <t hangText="SSRC of source: 32 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />As
            defined in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.<vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="On-time Playout Duration: 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />'On-time' playout is the uninterrupted,
            in-sequence playout of valid decoded audio information originating
            from the remote endpoint. This includes comfort noise during
            periods of remote talker silence, if VAD <xref
            target="VAD"></xref> is used, and locally generated or regenerated
            tones and announcements. <vspace blankLines="1" />An equivalent
            definition is that on-time playout is playout of any signal other
            than those used for concealment. <vspace blankLines="1" />On-time
            playout duration is expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds and MUST
            include both speech and silence intervals, whether VAD is used or
            not.</t>

            <t>If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
            MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the
            measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Loss Concealment Duration: 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The duration, expressed in units of 1/65536
            seconds, of audio playout corresponding to Loss-type concealment.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />Loss-type concealment is reactive
            insertion or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due
            to effective frame loss at the audio decoder. "Effective frame
            loss" is the event in which a frame of coded audio is simply not
            present at the audio decoder when required. In this case,
            substitute audio samples are generally formed, at the decoder or
            elsewhere, to reduce audible impairment. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the
            value 0xFFFFFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-range
            measurement. If the measurement is unavailable, the value
            0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t
            hangText="Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration: 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The duration, expressed in units of 1/65536
            seconds, of audio playout corresponding to Buffer Adjustment-type
            concealment, if known. <vspace blankLines="1" />If the measured
            value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE MUST be reported to
            indicate an over-range measurement. If the measurement is
            unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Buffer Adjustment-type concealment is proactive
            or controlled insertion or deletion of samples in the audio
            playout stream due to jitter buffer adaptation, re-sizing or
            re-centering decisions within the endpoint. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Because this insertion is controlled, rather than
            occurring randomly in response to losses, it is typically less
            audible than loss-type concealment. For example, jitter buffer
            adaptation events may be constrained to occur during periods of
            talker silence, in which case only silence duration is affected,
            or sophisticated time-stretching methods for insertion/deletion
            during favorable periods in active speech may be employed. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Concealment events which cannot be classified as
            Buffer Adjustment-type MUST be classified as Loss-type. <vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Playout Interrupt Count: 16 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The number of interruptions to normal playout
            which occurred during the reporting period. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
            0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If
            the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Reserved (resv): 16 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />These bits are reserved. They MUST be set to zero
            by senders and ignored by receivers (See <xref

            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Mean Playout Interrupt Size: 32 bits"><vspace

      Measurement Information block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref> which
      describes measurement periods in use (see <xref target="RFC6776"></xref>
      section 4.2). This Metrics Block relies on the measurement period in the
      Measurement Information block indicating the span of the report and
      SHOULD be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the measurement
      information block. If the measurement period is not received in the same
      compound RTCP packet as this Metrics Block, this metrics block MUST be
      discarded.</t>

      <t>The following metrics are based on successive one second intervals as
      declared by a RTP clock. This RTP clock does NOT need to be synchronized
      to any external time reference. The starting time of this clock is
      unspecified. Note that this implies that the same loss pattern could
      result in slightly different count values, depending on where the losses
      occur relative to the particular one-second demarcation points. For
      example, two loss events occurring 50ms apart could result in either one
      concealed second or two, depending on the particular one second
      boundaries used. </t>

      <t>The seconds in this sub-block are not necessarily calendar seconds.
      At the tail end of a session, periods of time of less than one second
      shall be incorporated into these counts if they exceed 500ms and shall
      be disregarded if they are less than 500ms. </t>

            block.] <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />This field is used to indicate whether the
            Concealment Seconds Metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative
            metrics: <list>
                <t>I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
                most recent measurement interval duration between successive
                metrics reports.</t>

                <t>I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to
                the accumulation period characteristic of cumulative
                measurements.</t>

              </list><vspace blankLines="1" />In this document, Concealment
            Seconds Metrics can only be measured over definite intervals, and
            cannot be sampled. Also, the value I=00 is reserved for future
            use. Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00 or I=01. If a block is
            received with I=00 or I=01, the receiver MUST discard the block.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Packet Loss Concealment Method (plc): 2 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />This field is used to identify the packet loss
            concealment method in use at the receiver, according to the
            following code: <list>
                <t>bits 014-015<list>

              </list><vspace blankLines="1" />Note that the enhancement method
            (plc =3) for packet loss concealment offers an improved audio
            quality and or a better robustness against packet losses [G.711]
            and is equivalent to enhanced in section 4.7.1 of
            [RFC3611],<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Reserved (resv): 4 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />These bits are reserved. They MUST be set to zero
            by senders and ignored by receivers (See <xref

            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Block Length: 16 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" /> The
            length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one. For the
            Concealment Seconds Block, the block length is equal to 4.<vspace

            <t hangText="SSRC of source: 32 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />As
            defined in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.<vspace

            <t hangText="Unimpaired Seconds: 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A count of the number of unimpaired Seconds that
            have occurred.<vspace blankLines="1" />An unimpaired Second is
            defined as a continuous period of one second during which no frame
            loss or discard due to late arrival has occurred. Every second in
            a session must be classified as either OK or Concealed. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Normal playout of comfort noise or other silence
            concealment signal during periods of talker silence, if VAD is
            used, shall be counted as unimpaired seconds.</t>

            <t>If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
            MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the
            measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Concealed Seconds: 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A count of the number of Concealed Seconds that
            have occurred.<vspace blankLines="1" />A Concealed Second is
            defined as a continuous period of one second during which any
            frame loss or discard due to late arrival has occurred. <vspace
            blankLines="1" /> Equivalently, a concealed second is one in which
            some Loss-type concealment has occurred. Buffer adjustment-type
            concealment SHALL not cause Concealed Seconds to be incremented,
            with the following exception. An implementation MAY cause
            Concealed Seconds to be incremented for 'emergency' buffer
            adjustments made during talkspurts. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Loss-type concealment is reactive insertion or
            deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to effective
            frame loss at the audio decoder. "Effective frame loss" is the
            event in which a frame of coded audio is simply not present at the
            audio decoder when required. In this case, substitute audio
            samples are generally formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to
            reduce audible impairment. <vspace blankLines="1" />Buffer
            Adjustment-type concealment is proactive or controlled insertion
            or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to jitter
            buffer adaptation, re-sizing or re-centering decisions within the
            endpoint. <vspace blankLines="1" />Because this insertion is
            controlled, rather than occurring randomly in response to losses,
            it is typically less audible than loss-type concealment. For
            example, jitter buffer adaptation events may be constrained to
            occur during periods of talker silence, in which case only silence
            duration is affected, or sophisticated time-stretching methods for
            insertion/deletion during favorable periods in active speech may
            be employed. For these reasons, buffer adjustment-type concealment
            MAY be exempted from inclusion in calculations of Concealed
            Seconds and Severely Concealed Seconds. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />However, an implementation SHOULD include
            buffer-type concealment in counts of Concealed Seconds and
            Severely Concealed Seconds if the event occurs at an 'inopportune'
            moment, with an emergency or large, immediate adaptation during
            active speech, or for unsophisticated adaptation during speech
            without regard for the underlying signal, in which cases the
            assumption of low-audibility cannot hold. In other words, jitter
            buffer adaptation events which may be presumed to be audible
            SHOULD be included in Concealed Seconds and Severely Concealed
            Seconds counts.</t>

            <t>Concealment events which cannot be classified as Buffer
            Adjustment- type MUST be classified as Loss-type.</t>

            <t>For clarification, the count of Concealed Seconds MUST include
            the count of Severely Concealed Seconds.</t>

            <t>If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
            MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the
            measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be
            reported.</t>

            <t hangText="Severely Concealed Seconds: 16 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A count of the number of Severely Concealed
            Seconds.<vspace blankLines="1" />A Severely Concealed Second is
            defined as a non-overlapping period of one second during which the
            cumulative amount of time that has been subject to frame loss or
            discard due to late arrival, exceeds the SCS Threshold. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
            0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If
            the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Reserved: 8 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />These bits
            are reserved. They MUST be set to zero by senders and ignored by
            receivers (See [RFC6709] section 4.2). <vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="SCS Threshold: 8 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />The
            SCS Threshold is defined as the percentage of packets
            corresponding to lost or discarded frames that must occur within a
            one second period in order for the second to be classified as a
            Severely Concealed Second. This is expressed in numeric format 0:8
            and hence can represent a range of 0.1 to 25.5 percent loss or
            discard. <vspace blankLines="1" />A default threshold of 5%
            effective frame loss (50ms effective frame loss ) per second is

            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
