Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions           April 2013


1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] data format is in widespread use to represent
   calendar data. iCalendar represents dates and times using the
   Gregorian calendar system only.  It does provide a way to use non-
   Gregorian calendar systems via a "CALSCALE" property, however this
   has never been formally used.  However, there is a need to support at
   least non-Gregorian recurrence patterns to cover anniversaries, and
   many local, religious, or civil holidays based on non-Gregorian
   dates.

   There are several disadvantages to using the existing "CALSCALE"
   property in iCalendar for implementing non-Gregorian calendars:

   1.  The "CALSCALE" property exists in the top-level "VCALENDAR"
       objects and thus applies to all components within that object.
       In today's multi-cultural society, that restricts the ability to
       mix events from different calendar systems within the same
       iCalendar object. e.g., it would prevent having both the
       Gregorian New Year and Chinese New Year in the same iCalendar
       object.

   2.  Many countries observe daylight savings time, encoded in
       iCalendar using the "VTIMEZONE" component.  Timezone and daylight
       saving time rules are always specified via Gregorian calendar
       based recurrence rules (e.g., "the 3rd Sunday in March").  This
       is problematic for non-Gregorian uses of "CALSCALE" which would
       by default also apply to the dates and rules used in the
       "VTIMEZONE" components in the corresponding iCalendar object.

   This specification solves these issues by allowing the "CALSCALE" to
   remain set to Gregorian, but re-defining the recurrence rule property
   "RRULE" to accept new items including one that allows non-Gregorian
   calendar systems to be used.  With this, all the date, time and
   period values in the iCalendar object would remain specified using
   the Gregorian calendar system, but repeating patterns in other
   calendar systems could be defined.  It is then up to calendar user
   agents and servers to map between Gregorian and non-Gregorian
   calendar systems in order to expand out recurrence instances.

   This specification does not itself define calendar systems, rather it
   utilizes the registry defined by the Unicode Consortium
   (http://unicode.org) in their CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository)
   project.

2.  Open Issues

   Use "RRULE" or a new property (e.g., "RPATTERN") - depends on how
   well existing clients cope with the extended "RRULE" behavior
   currently defined here.


3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC5234] as
   used by iCalendar [RFC5545].  Any syntax elements shown below that
   are not explicitly defined in this specification come from iCalendar
   [RFC5545].

   When a Gregorian calendar date value is shown in text, it will use
   the format "YYYYMMHH", where "YYYY" is the 4-digit year, "MM" the
   2-digit month, and "DD" the 2-digit day (this is the same format used
   in iCalendar [RFC5545]).  The Chinese calendar will be used as an
   example of a non-Gregorian calendar for illustrative purposes.  When
   a Chinese calendar date value is shown in text, it will use the
   format "{C}YYYYMM[L]DD" - i.e., the same format as Gregorian but with
   a "{C}" prefix, and an optional "L" character after the month element
   to indicate a leap month.  Similarly, {I} and {H} are used in other
   examples as prefixes for Islamic and Hebrew dates, respectively.


4.  Overview

   In the Gregorian calendar system, each year is composed of a fixed
   number of months (12), with each month having a fixed number of days
   (between 30 and 31), except for the second month (February) which
   contains either 28 days, or 29 days (in a leap year).  Weeks are
   composed of 7 days, with day names Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
   Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Years can have either 365 or
   366 days (the later in a leap year).  The number of whole weeks in a
   year is 52.

   In iCalendar, the "RECUR" value type defines various fields used to
   express a recurrence pattern, and those fields are given limits based
   on those of the Gregorian calendar system.  Since other calendar
   systems can have different limits and other behaviors that need to be
   accounted for, the maximum values for the elements in the "RECUR"
   value are not covered by this specification.

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions           April 2013


   To generate a set of recurring instances in a non-Gregorian calendar
   system, the following procedure is used:

   1.  iCalendar data continues to use the "GREGORIAN" calendar system,
       so all "DATE", "DATE-TIME" and "PERIOD" values continue to use
       the Gregorian format and limits.

   2.  The "RRULE" property is extended to include an "RSCALE" element
       in its value that specifies the calendar system to use for the
       recurrence pattern.  The existing elements of the "RRULE" value
       type are used, but modified to support different upper limits,
       based on the "RSCALE" value, as well as a modification to month
       numbers to allow a leap month to be specified.  Existing
       requirements for the use of "RRULE" all still apply (e.g., the
       "RRULE" has to match the "DTSTART" value of the master instance).
       Other recurrence properties such as "RECURRENCE-ID", "RDATE" and
       "EXDATE" continue to use the Gregorian date format as "CALSCALE"
       is unchanged.

   When generating instances, the following procedure might be used:

   1.  Convert the "DTSTART" property value of the master recurring
       component into the date and time components for the calendar
       system specified by the "RSCALE" element in the "RRULE" value.
       This provides the "seed" value for generating subsequent
       recurrence instances.

   2.  Iteratively generate instances using the "RRULE" value applied to
       the year, month, and day components of the date in the new
       calendar system.

   3.  For each generated instance, convert the date values back from
       the non-Gregorian form into Gregorian and use those values for
       other properties such as "RECURRENCE-ID".

   Consider the following example for an event representing the Chinese
   New Year:

   DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20130210
   RRULE:RSCALE=CHINESE;FREQ=YEARLY
   SUMMARY:Chinese New Year

   To generate instances, first the "DTSTART" value "20130210" is
   converted into the Chinese calendar system giving "{C}47110101".
   Next, the year component is incremented by one to give "{C}47120101",
   and that is then converted back into Gregorian as "20140131".
   Additional instances are generated by iteratively increasing the year
   component in the Chinese date value and converting back to Gregorian.

   This specification makes use of calendar algorithms defined by the
   Unicode Consortium [TBD - reference].  The definition of different
   calendar scales is defined by Unicode, as per Section 6.


5.  Extended RRULE Property

   This specification extends the existing "RRULE" iCalendar property
   value to include a new "RSCALE" element that can be used to indicate
   the calendar system used for generating the recurrence pattern.  The
   "RSCALE" element MUST be included as the first element in the "RRULE"
   value if present.

   When "RSCALE" is present, the other changes to "RRULE" are:

   1.  Elements that include numeric values (e.g., "BYYEARDAY") have
       numeric ranges defined by the "RSCALE" value (i.e., in some
       calendar systems there might be more than 366 days in a year).

   2.  Month numbers can include an "L" suffix to indicate that the
       specified month is a leap month in the corresponding calendar
       system.

   3.  Month numbers can be specified using a negative offset (i.e.,
       "-1" represents the last month of the year).

   4.  A "SKIP" element is added to define how "missing" instances are
       handled. e.g., if a yearly recurring event starts in a leap
       month, the "SKIP" element determines whether instances in non-
       leap years are ignored ("SKIP" set to "YES"), appear in the
       preceding regular month ("SKIP" set to "BACKWARD" - the default
       when "RSCALE" is present), or appear in the following regular
       month ("SKIP" set to "FORWARD").

   The syntax for the "RECUR" value is modified in the following
   fashion:

   recur-rule-part /=   ("RSCALE" "=" rscale)
                      / ("SKIP" "=" skip)
                    ;
                    ; RSCALE MUST be specified before all other
                    ; elements in the "RECUR" value.

   rscale          = (iana-token  ; A CLDR-registered calendar system
                                  ; name (see Section 6).
                    / x-name)     ; A non-standard, experimental
                                  ; calendar system name.

   skip            = ("YES" / "BACKWARD" / "FORWARD")
                    ; When "RSCALE" is not present the default
                    ; is "YES". When "RSCALE" is present the default
                    ; is "BACKWARD".

   monthnum        = [plus / minus] 1*2DIGIT  ["L"]
                    ; Existing element modified to include a positive
                    ; or negative offset capability, as well as a leap
                    ; month indicator suffix.


5.1.  Handling Leap Months

   Leap months can occur in different calendar systems.  For most of
   those, the suffix "L" is added to the "RRULE" month number component
   to indicate a leap month.  In some cases the month precedes the
   regular month with the same number, in other cases it follows.  The
   one exception to this rule is the Hebrew calendar, where we follow
   the definition from Unicode [TBD - REF].  In that case months are
   number 1 through 13, with month 6 being the leap month.  Thus in non-
   leap years, month 6 is skipped.

5.2.  Examples

5.2.1.  Chinese New Year

   Consider the following set of iCalendar properties:

   DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20130210
   RRULE:RSCALE=CHINESE;FREQ=YEARLY
   SUMMARY:Chinese New Year

   These define a recurring event for the Chinese New Year, with the
   first instance the one in Gregorian year 2013.

   The Chinese date corresponding to the first instance is {C}47110101.
   The table below shows the initial instance, and the next four, each

   of which is determined by adding the appropriate amount to the year
   component of the Chinese date.  Also shown is the conversion back to
   the Gregorian date:

     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+
     | Chinese Date | Gregorian Date                                 |
     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+
     | {C}47110101  | 20130210 - DTSTART specified in iCalendar data |
     | {C}47120101  | 20140131                                       |
     | {C}47130101  | 20150120                                       |
     | {C}47140101  | 20160208                                       |
     | {C}47150101  | 20170128                                       |
     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+

5.2.2.  Islamic Start of Ramadan

   Consider the following set of iCalendar properties:

   DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20130709
   RRULE:RSCALE=ISLAMIC;FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=9
   SUMMARY:Start of Ramadan

   These define a recurring event for the start of the Islamic month of
   Ramadan, with the first instance the one in Gregorian year 2013.

   The Islamic date corresponding to the first instance is {I}14340901.
   The table below shows the initial instance, and the next four, each
   of which is determined by adding the appropriate amount to the year
   component of the Islamic date.  Also shown is the conversion back to
   the Gregorian date:

     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+
     | Islamic Date | Gregorian Date                                 |
     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+
     | {I}14340901  | 20130709 - DTSTART specified in iCalendar data |
     | {I}14350901  | 20140628                                       |
     | {I}14360901  | 20150618                                       |
     | {I}14370901  | 20160606                                       |
     | {I}14380901  | 20170527                                       |
     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+

   Note that in this example, the value of the "BYMONTH" component in
   the "RRULE" matches the Islamic month value and not the Gregorian
   month.

5.2.3.  Hebrew anniversary starting in a leap month

   Consider the following set of iCalendar properties:

   DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20140208
   RRULE:RSCALE=HEBREW;FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=6;BYMONTHDAY=8;SKIP=FORWARD
   SUMMARY:Anniversary

   These define a recurring event for the 8th day of the Hebrew month of
   Adar I, with the first instance the one in Gregorian year 2014.

   The Hebrew date corresponding to the first instance is {H}57740608,
   note that month 6 is a leap month in year 5774.  The table below
   shows the initial instance, and the next four, each of which is
   determined by adding the appropriate amount to the year component of
   the Hebrew date, taking into account that only year 5776 is a leap
   year.  Thus in other years the Hebrew month component is adjusted
   forward to month 7.  Also shown is the conversion back to the
   Gregorian date:

     +-------------+------------------------------------------------+
     | Hebrew Date | Gregorian Date                                 |
     +-------------+------------------------------------------------+
     | {H}57740608 | 20140208 - DTSTART specified in iCalendar data |
     | {H}57750708 | 20150227                                       |
     | {H}57760608 | 20160217                                       |
     | {H}57770708 | 20170306                                       |
     | {H}57780708 | 20180223                                       |
     +-------------+------------------------------------------------+


6.  Registering Calendar Systems

   This specification uses the Unicode Consortium's registry of calendar
   systems to define valid values for the "RSCALE" element of an "RRULE"
   [TBD - Unicode BCP47 -
   http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/trunk/common/bcp47/calendar.xml].  Note
   that the underscore character "_" is never used in CLDR-based
   calendar system names.  New values can be added to this registry
   following Unicode Consortium rules.  It is expected that many
   implementations of non-Gregorian calendars will use software
   libraries provided by Unicode (ICU), and hence it makes sense to re-
   use their registry rather than creating a new one.  For consistency,
   when used, the "RSCALE" values SHOULD be uppercased.

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any addition security concerns
   beyond those described in [RFC5545].


8.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not define any new IANA registries or values.
