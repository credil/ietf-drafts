1.  Introduction

   I2RS working group is chartered to define an interface to the routing
   system.  This interface can be used to read topology and forwarding
   information of the routing system.  This document discusses the use
   cases of I2RS in IPv4/IPv6 transition scenario.

3.  Use case of I2RS in IPv4/IPv6 transition scenario

3.1.  I2RS use case for IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack network

   There are several different ways for IPv4/IPv6 transition.  For
   example, dual-stack is one popular technology to enable IPv4 to IPv6
   transition.  In dual-stack network, every router has both IPv4 and
   IPv6 IP stack running on it.  The IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stack
   running on the dual-stack router normally work independently from
   each other although they share the same physical resources in the
   dual-stack router(CPU,memory etc).  There are two different views of
   the dual-stack network from the IPv4 or IPv6 perspective.  There are
   different set of routing information base for IPv4 and IPv6.  In most
   cases, the IPv4 and IPv6 network need to have the same topology and
   forwarding state since they normally serves for the same dusal-stack
   host.

   Figure 1.  IPv4/IPv6 Dual-stack network for IPv4/IPv6 transition

   It is a big challenge for the operators to operate dual-stack
   network, there are several reasons: 1.  The network operation and
   management team may not familiar with IPv6.  They have to learn new
   knowledge and new tools for IPv6.  2.  There are two separate domains
   of the IPv4 and IPv6 network, the trouble shooting will become much
   more complex than single stack network.  3.  Since the IPv4 and IPv6
   stack share a single physical router, the problem of one protocol
   stack may spread to the other stack.

   With I2RS, it can help the network operator to maintain a consistent
   view of both the IPv4 and IPv6 network in real time.  The network
   operator can even configure the IPv6 network based on the existing
   IPv4 network and make the IPv4 network and the IPv6 have the same
   topology and forwarding state.  This will reduce the complexity of
   operation and management and help the network operator discovery the
   in-consistent between the IPv4 and IPv6 network quickly.

3.2.  I2RS use case in IPv4 and IPv6 translation scenario

   In IPv4 and IPv6 translation scenario, the IPv4/IPv6 network's
   packets will be translated in to IPv4/IPv6 network's packets and vice
   versa.  It is difficult for the network management system to get a
   consistent view of the translated network.

   Figure 2.  IPv4/IPv6 translation network for IPv4/IPv6 transition

   It is difficult for the current network management system to get IPv4
   and IPv6 network topology and routing information simultaneously.
   With I2RS, it can provide a flexible way to get both IPv4 and IPv6
   network topology and other information, hence it could be very useful
   for trouble shooting and network management.

3.3.  Requirement for I2RS from the use case

   From the above use case, the requirements for I2RS are: 1.  I2RS
   interface should support both IPv4 and IPv6.  It should be able to
   read both IPv4 and IPv6 routing information in a timely manner.  2.
   I2RS interface should have enough security mechanism to protect the
   data that read from the routing information base.  3.  I2RS interface
   should have data consistent protection mechanism to protect the data
   in the routing information base.  4.  I2RS interface should allow
   injection of routing polices to the routing forwarding table.

4.  Security Considerations

   Routing information is very critical and sensitive information for
   the operators.  I2RS should provide strong security mechanism to
   protect the routing information that it could not be accessed by the
   un-authorised users.  It should also protect the security and
   integrity protection of the routing data.

5.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA action is required.
