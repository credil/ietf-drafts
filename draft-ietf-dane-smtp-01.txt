Secure SMTP using DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) TLSA

Abstract

   SMTP has a STARTTLS extension, but (especially in the case of inter-
   domain mail transfer) it only provides very limited security because
   it does not specify how to authenticate the server's certificate.
   This memo specifies how TLSA records in the DNS can be used for
   proper SMTP server authentication.

Internet-Draft               SMTP with TLSA                February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The specification for SMTP over TLS [RFC3207] does not describe how
   to authenticate a server: which identity relating to the connection
   ought to be authenticated by the server's certificate.  In practice,
   most certificates presented by publicly-referenced SMTP servers
   either cannot be validated with respect to a well-known certification
   authority, or do not verify any identity expected by the client.

   As a result, inter-domain SMTP clients cannot require working server
   authentication if they want to successfully send mail using TLS.
   Therefore TLS currently provides only a limited amount of additional
   security for inter-domain SMTP.  Its encryption protects against on-
   path passive eavesdropping; but it does not protect against an active
   attack, since the client has no way to detect when an attacker is
   spoofing the server.

   This memo describes how to fix this using DNSSEC [RFC4033] and TLSA
   records [RFC6698] set up as described in [I-D.ietf-dane-srv].  To
   summarize, we use DNSSEC to secure the association between a mail
   domain and its SMTP server host names (i.e. the MX recods), and
   between the host names and their certificates (using TLSA records).
   Connections to servers are authenticated by their TLS certificates.
   The existance of TLSA records also signals to the client that it can
   expect the server to offer TLS with a valid certificate.

   The security situation is better for intra-domain SMTP, because in
   this case the client and server can be configured with prior
   knowledge of how to authenticate each other.  This specification can
   also be used for authenticating servers in intra-domain SMTP.

   This memo does not cover message submission [RFC4409] [RFC5068]
   [RFC6186], nor does it cover LMTP [RFC2033], since they use the DNS
   in a different way than MTA-to-MTA SMTP.

   The protocol described in this memo adds new security checks that can
   cause email delivery to be delayed when a security failure is
   detected.  We specify that clients treat such problems as a
   "temporary failure", causing the message to be queued for a later
   delivery attempt, in the hope that the attack (or configuration
   error) will have been dealt with.

Internet-Draft               SMTP with TLSA                February 2013


   ADMD:  An ADministrative Management Domain, as described in the
      Internet Mail Architecture [RFC5598].

   Inter-domain SMTP:  SMTP between different ADMDs across the public
      Internet, where a client MTA sends mail to a publicly-referenced
      SMTP server MTA.

   Intra-domain SMTP:  SMTP between MTAs within an ADMD.

   Mail domain:  The part of an email address after the "@"; also the
      query name for a (possibly implicit) MX record.

   MX resolution:  The algorithm for resolving a mail domain into a set
      of SMTP server hosts, described in [RFC5321] section 5.

   Publicly-referenced SMTP server:  An SMTP server which runs on port
      25 of an Internet host located using MX resolution.  (This term is
      from [RFC3207].)

   SMTP server host name:  The target of a (possibly implicit) MX
      record.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   memo are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Inter-domain SMTP with TLSA

   This is a combination of the usual MX resolution algorithm described
   in [RFC5321] section 5, and the rules for using DANE TLSA records
   with SRV and MX records [I-D.ietf-dane-srv].  The former determines
   the server ordering and selection rules (which differ slightly from
   the rules for SRV records, for instance, in the case of backup MX
   relaying).  The latter determines the rules for handling TLSA
   records.

   Note the difference between the (effective) absence of TLSA records,
   and the presence of unusable TLSA records.  If a server has no TLSA
   records, or their DNSSEC validation status is "indeterminate" or
   "insecure", the client can attempt to deliver to this server
   insecurely (which might be over unauthenticated TLS, as described in
   the introduction).  If a server has TLSA records whose DNSSEC
   validation status is "secure", whether they are usable or not, the
   client MUST use TLS to connect to the server and validate the
   certificate according to [I-D.ietf-dane-srv] section 3.

4.  Intra-domain SMTP with TLSA

   Mail transmission within an ADMD can be based on MX records (such as
   when delivering incoming mail to its destination host) or on
   statically configured host names (such as when routing outgoing mail
   via a border relay).

   When routing internal mail using MX records, Section 3 applies the
   same as for inter-domain SMTP.

   When routing mail using host names, the MX lookup step is skipped and
   TODO need a better explanation.


5.  Security considerations

   This memo provides only conditional security.  It allows a server to
   publish in the DNS the details of how it can be authenticated.
   Clients that implement this protocol can use it to provide a strong
   guarantee that they are sending mail to the correct place.  If either
   of these is missing, mail delivery will be insecure.

   In addition to the following, many security considerations are
   covered in [I-D.ietf-dane-srv].

5.1.  Temporary failures and denial of service

   Many provisioning failures in SMTP cause "permanent" failures, that
   is the immediate and final rejection of the message.  This includes
   missing DNS records, an SMTP server that is not configured to accept
   mail for the recipient domain, and so forth.

   In this protocol, provisioning an incorrect TLS certificate triggers
   a temporary error.  This is because we want to minimise the damage
   that occurs when an on-path attacker intercepts the TCP connection
   between an SMTP client and server.  An attacker can cause delays, but
   is not able to trigger immediate delivery failures.

5.2.  Deliberate omissions

   This memo does not specify any changes to SMTP client authentication.
   Inter-domain SMTP client authentication remains extremely weak.
   Intra-domain SMTP can be configured as strong as necessary (using
   SMTP AUTH or TLS client certificates, for instance) but that is out
   of scope for this memo.

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   If any of the DNS queries are for an internationalized domain name,
   then they need to use the A-label form [RFC5890].  TODO: this section
   needs checking WRT IMA.


7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA action is required.


8.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Mark Andrews for arguing that authenticating the SMTP
   server host name is the right thing, and that we ought to rely on
   DNSSEC to secure the MX lookup.  Thanks to James Cloos, Ned Freed,
   Olafur Gudmundsson, Paul Hoffman, Phil Pennock, Hector Santos, Jonas
   Schneider, and Alessandro Vesely for helpful suggestions.

Appendix A.  Example

   In the following, most of the DNS resource data is elided for
   simplicity.


   ; mail domain
   example.com.              MX      1 mx.example.net.
   example.com.              RRSIG   MX ...

   ; SMTP server host name
   mx.example.net.           A      192.0.2.1
   mx.example.net.           AAAA   2001:db8:212:8::e:1

   ; TLSA resource record
   _25._tcp.mx.example.net.  TLSA   ...
   _25._tcp.mx.example.net.  RRSIG  TLSA ...

   Mail for addresses at example.com is delivered by SMTP to
   mx.example.net.  Connections to mx.example.net port 25 that use
   STARTTLS will get a server certificate that authenticates the name
   mx.example.net.
