 Protection Mechanisms for Label Distribution Protocol P2MP/MP2MP Label
                             Switched Paths
                draft-zhao-mpls-mldp-protections-01.txt

Abstract

   Service providers continue to deploy real-time multicast applications
   using Multicast LDP (mLDP) across MPLS networks.  There is a clear
   need to protect these real-time applications and to provide the
   shortest switching times in the event of failure.  This document
   outlines the requirements, describes the protection mechanisms
   available, and where necessary proposes extensions to facilitate mLDP
   P2MP and MP2MP LSP protection within an MPLS network.

1.  Terminology

   For a clear narrative, this section gives a general conceptional
   overview of the terms.

   o  PLR: The node where the traffic is logically redirected onto the
      preset backup path is called Point of Local Repair.

   o  MP: The node where the backup path merges with the primary path is
      called Merge Point.

   o  FD: The node that detects the failure on primary path, and then
      triggers the action(s) for traffic protection is called Failure
      Detector.  Either traffic sender or receiver can be the FD,
      depending on which protection mode are deployed.  More details are
      described in later sections of this document.

   o  SP: The node where the traffic is physically switched/duplicated
      onto the backup path is called Switchover Point.  In multicast
      cases, PLR and SP can be two different nodes.  More details are
      described in later sections of this document.


2.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Introduction

   In order to meet user demands, operators and service providers
   continue to deploy multicast applications using mLDP across MPLS
   networks.  In certain scenarios, traditional IGP-mLDP convergence
   mechanisms fail to meet protection switching times required to
   minimise, or negate entirely, application interruptions for real-time
   applications, including stock trading, on-line games, and multimedia
   teleconferencing.

   Current best practice for protecting services, and higher
   applications includes the pre-computation and establishment of a
   backup path, this can decrease the convergence time efficiently.
   Once a failure has been detected on the primary path, the traffic
   should be transmitted across the back-up path.

   However, two major challenges exist with the aforementioned solution.
   The first is how to build an absolutely disjointed backup path for

   each node in a multicast tree; the second is how to balance between
   convergence time and resource consumption.

   This document provides several ways to setup the backup path for mLDP
   LSP, including P2P tunnel based mLDP local protection, P2MP LSP based
   mLDP local protection, and end-to-end protection.  The goal is to
   build a reliable umbrella to against traffic black hole.  Note that
   the buackup path computation is out of the scope of this draft, the
   algorothm can be either LFA or any other algorithms available
   including the offline tools.  Besides, how to detect failure is also
   outside the scope of this document.

   More and more users are apt to deploy multicast applications on MPLS
   mLDP network.  In some scenarios, traditional IGP-mLDP convergence is
   hard to meet the requirements of those real-time applications, such
   as stock business, on-line game, and multimedia teleconference.

   The industry has reached a consensus that setting up a backup path
   previously can decrease the convergence time efficiently.  No matter
   how the above-mentioned backup path was established, once the failure
   is detected, the traffic should be transmitted at that path as soon
   as possible.  Even so, there are still two major challenges left for
   us, one is how to build an absolutely disjointed backup path for each
   node in a multicast tree; the other is how to balance between
   convergence time and resource consumption.

   It is getting urgent to find the ideal protection mechanism(s) to
   improve the convergence time, and at the meantime minimize the side-
   effects, such as bandwidth wastage.

   For a primary LDP P2MP/MP2MP LSP, there are several ways to set up
   its backup path.  It can use RSVP-TE P2P tunnel as a logical out-
   going interface, consequently utilize the mature high availability
   technologies of RSVP-TE.  Or, it can make use of LDP P2P backup LSP
   as a packet encapsulation, so that the complex configuration of P2P
   RSVP-TE can be skipped.  Or, it can build its own P2MP/MP2MP backup
   LSP according to IGP's loop-free alternative route, thus avoid
   unnecessary packet duplication.  Other than these, it can also build
   a totally disjointed LSP in another topology, accordingly take
   advantage of the real end-to-end protection.

   When the backup path is present, there are two options for packet
   forwarding and switchover.  If the traffic sender feeds the stream on
   both paths, and the traffic receiver drops packet on backup path, the
   switchover will be very quick once the failure is detected, because
   the whole switchover action is a local behavior on traffic receiver.
   The disadvantage of this manner is that traffic will be duplicated on
   both paths, and consume double bandwidth.  Contrastively, if the

   traffic sender feeds stream only on the primary path, the resource
   wastage can be waived.  Cooperation is needed in this manner, so
   there will be some protocol extensions.  But if the performance can
   be equal or better than the previous option, it is reasonable to
   choose the second one.

   This document describes several methods to setup and switch paths for
   options to setup the backup LDP P2MP/MP2MP LSP. mLDP LSPs, including
   local protection, territorial protection, and end-to-end protection.
   The goal is to identify strengths, weaknesses and gaps, in order to
   build a reliable set of tools to shield against traffic black holes
   that would severely impact real-time applications, in the event of
   primary path failure.

3.1.  Requirements

   A number of requirements have been identified that allow the optimal
   set of mechanisms to developed.  These currently include:

   o  Computation of a disjointed (link and node) backup path within the
      multicast tree;

   o  Minimisation of protection convergence time;

   o  Optimisation of bandwidth usage.

3.2.  Scope

   The method to detect failure is outside the scope of this document.
   Also this document does not provide any authorization mechanism for
   controlling the set of LSRs that may attempt to join a mLDP
   protection session.


4.  mLDP Local Protection using P2P LSP

   By encapsulating mLDP packets within an P2P TE tunnel or P2P LDP
   backup LSP, the LDP P2MP/MP2MP LSP can be protected by the P2P
   protection mechanisms.  However, this protection mechanism is not
   capable of detecting, and recovering, if the failure occurs on the
   destination node of the P2P backup LSP.  Thus, this section provides
   a unified method to protect both node and link with P2P backup LSP.

                                 Figure 1

   In Figure 1 (P2P Based mLDP Local Protection Example) above, the
   preferential path from R1 to R4/R5 is through R2, and the secondary
   path is through R3.  In this case, the mLDP LSP will be established
   according to the IGP preferential path as R1--R2--R4/R5.

   It is the responsibility of R2 to inform R1 of its downstream LSRs
   (in this example R4 and R5) and the respective labels (L4 and L5).
   Once the link between R1 and R2 fails, or R2 node fails, R1 will
   duplicate the traffic to R4 and R5, with inner label as L4/L5, and
   outer label as the P2P backup LSP R1--R3--R5--R4 and R1--R3--R5.

   Finally, the previous forwarding states will be removed after R4 and
   R5 finish their Make-Before-Break (MBB) procedure.

   Note that the mLDP Local Protection mechanism can be used in any part
   of the mLDP LSP other then the ingress and egress nodes.  In other
   words, R1 can be either Ingress or Transit node, R4/R5 can be either

   Transit or Egress node.  Only R1 and R2 need enhancement for this
   mechanism, other nodes can just follow the existing mature protocol
   procedures.

4.1.  Signaling procedures for P2P Based Local Protection

   Continuing to use Figure 1 (mLDP Local Protection Example), R2 sends
   a notification message to R1 to inform the node that R2 has two
   downstream nodes, R4 and R5 with forwarding labels L4 and L5
   respectively.

   When R1 sees R2 node going down, it takes mLDP packets as it would
   send them to R4 and R5 through R2 and sends them into the two P2P
   backup tunnels:

   o  P2P tunnel R1--R3--R5--R4, using inner label L4.

   o  P2P tunnel R1--R3--R5, using inner label L5.

   So that R4/R5 will receive same packets as from the interface between
   R2 and R4/R5, just from different interface.

4.2.  Protocol Extensions for P2P Based Local Protection

   A new type of LDP MP Status Value Element is introduced, for
   notifying downstream LSRs and respective labels.  It is encoded as
   follows:

5.  mLDP Local Protection using P2MP LSP

   Making use of IGP-FRR results, LDP can build the backup mLDP LSP
   among PLR, the protected node, and MPs (the downstream nodes of the
   protected node).  In the cases where the amount of downstream nodes
   are huge, this mechanism can avoid unnecessary packet duplication on
   PLR, so that protect the network from traffic congestion risk.

               mLDP Local Protection using P2MP LSP Example

                                 Figure 4

   In Figure 4 (P2MP Based mLDP Local Protection Example), the
   preferential path from R1 to R4/R5 is through R2, and the secondary
   path is through R3.  In this case, the mLDP LSP will be established
   according to the IGP preferential path as R1--R2--R4/R5.  This
   section will take the Protected Node as R2 for example, actually the
   Protected Node can be any Transit node of the mLDP LSP.

   As the Protected Node, R2 will announce its selected upstream node R1
   to all its downstream nodes, which are R4 and R5 in this example.  So
   that R4 and R5 can consider R1 as the root node of the backup mLDP
   LSP, and trigger the backup LSP signaling.  At the mean time, R4/R5
   will bind the backup ILM entry to the primary NHLFE(s), so that the
   traffic receiving from backup mLDP LSP can be merged locally to the
   primary LSP.

   The primary LSP and backup LSP are differentiated by the signaling

   procedure, so normally PLR can only feed traffic only on the primary
   path.  When the link between R1 and R2 fails, or R2 node fails, R1
   will switch the traffic to the preset backup path quickly.

   In this scenario, if R2 is protected by two P2P LSPs as R1--R3--R4
   and R1--R3--R5, the traffic will be duplicated on R1, and R3 will
   receive two streams.  If R2 is protected by mLDP LSP instead, R3 will
   only receive one stream, and the packet duplication will be done on
   R3.

5.1.   Signaling Procedures for P2MP Based Local Protection

   When the Protected Node (R2) determines its upstream LSR (R1), it
   will notify to all its downstream nodes immediately.  If there are
   other LSR(s) becoming its downstream node(s) later, it will do the
   announcement for the new downstream node(s).

   When the Merge Point (R4/R5) receive the notification, they
   individually determine the primary and secondary paths according to
   the IGP-FRR results.  Then they will send out label mapping messages
   including an LDP MP Status TLV that carries a FRR Status Code to
   indicate the primary path and secondary path.  The backup path is
   uniquely identified by root address, opaque value, PLR Node address,
   and Protected Node address.

   When the transit nodes of the secondary LSP receive the FRR label
   mapping message, they can easily consider it as a new mLDP LSP
   establishment, and follow the existing protocol procedures.  The only
   modification for these nodes is dealing with the FRR FEC, which is
   identified by root address, opaque value, PLR address, and Protected
   Node address.

   When the Point of Local Repair (R1) receive the FRR label mapping
   message, it will generate the backup forwarding entry for the
   specific LSP, which is identified by the root address and opaque
   value in the message, and bind and backup forwarding state to the
   specific primary entry, which is indicated by the Protected Node
   address in the message.  Note that there might be more than one
   backup forwarding entries for a specific protected node.

   To avoid the backup LSP going through the Protected Node, additional
   path selection rule(s) can be applied, such as not-via policy.  This
   part is under study, and will be added in the future.

   When failure is detected by PLR, it will switch the traffic to the
   secondary path.  At the mean time, MP will locally merge the traffic
   back to the primary LSP.

   When Merge Point(s) see the next hop to Root changed, it/they will
   advertise the new mapping, and the traffic will re-converge to the
   new primary path.

5.2.  Protocol extensions for P2MP Based Local Protection

   A new type of LDP MP Status Value Element is introduced, for

   to the last example where the priamry and backup topology are
   totatlly disjoint, if there is a link failure between the Root and R1
   or node R1 fails, there is no protection available.

6.1.  Signaling Procedures for MT Based End-to-end Protection

   Using the signaling procedure provied by [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-
   topology], Leaf 1 and Leaf 2 are able to trigger mLDP LSPs in
   different topologies, sending label mapping messages with same root
   address, same opaque value, different MT-ID and different label.
   When the Root node receives the label mapping messages from different
   topologies, it will set up two mLDP LSPs for application as end-to-
   end protection.  Failure detection for the primary mLDP LSP is
   outside the scope of this document.  Either Root node or Leaf node
   can be the Failure Detector.

6.2.  Protocol extensions for MT Based End-to-end Protection

   The protocol extensions required to build mLDP LSPs in different
   topologies are defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology].

9.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for the base LDP
   specification, as described in [RFC5036].  The protocol extensions
   specified in this document do not provide any authorization mechanism
   for controlling the set of LSRs that may attempt to join a mLDP
   protection session.  If such authorization is desirable, additional
   mechanisms, outside the scope of this document, are needed.

   Note that authorization policies should be implemented and/or
   configure at all the nodes involved .
