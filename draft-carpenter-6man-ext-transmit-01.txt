                 Transmission of IPv6 Extension Headers
                  draft-carpenter-6man-ext-transmit-01

Abstract

   Various IPv6 extension headers have been defined since the IPv6
   standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to
   clarify how intermediate nodes should deal with such extension
   headers and with any that are defined in future.  It also specifies
   how extension headers should be registered by IANA, with a
   corresponding minor update to RFC 2780.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Extension Header Transmission      November 2012


1.  Introduction

   An initial set of IPv6 extension headers was defined by [RFC2460],
   which also described how they should be handled by intermediate
   nodes, with the exception of the hop-by-hop options header:

   "...extension headers are not examined or processed
   by any node along a packet's delivery path, until the packet reaches
   the node (or each of the set of nodes, in the case of multicast)
   identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header."

   This provision allowed for the addition of new extension headers,
   since it means that forwarding nodes should be completely transparent
   to them.  Thus, new extension headers could be introduced
   progressively, used only by hosts that have been updated to create
   and interpret them.  Several such extension headers have been defined
   since RFC 2460.

   Unfortunately, experience has showed that the network is not
   transparent to these headers.  The main reason for this is that some
   firewalls attempt to inspect the transport header or payload.  This
   means that they need to traverse the chain of extension headers, if
   present, until they find the transport header (or an encrypted
   payload).  Unfortunately, because some IPv6 extension headers do not
   follow a uniform TLV format, this process is clumsy and requires
   knowledge of each extension header's format.

   The process is slow as well as clumsy, precluding its use in nodes
   attempting to process packets at line speed.  The present document
   does not intend to solve this problem, which is caused by the
   fundamental architecture of IPv6 extension headers.  This document
   focuses on clarifying how the header chain should be traversed in the
   current IPv6 architecture.

   If they encounter an unknown extension header type, some firewalls
   treat the packet as suspect and drop it.  It is an established fact
   that several widely used firewalls do not recognise some or all of
   the extension headers defined since RFC 2460.  It has also been
   observed that certain firewalls do not even handle all the extension
   headers in RFC 2460, including the fragment header
   [I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop], causing fundamental problems of
   connectivity.  This applies in particular to firewalls that attempt
   to inspect packets statelessly at very high speed, since they cannot
   take the time to reassemble fragmented packets, especially when under
   a denial of service attack.

   Other types of middlebox, such as load balancers or packet
   classifiers, might also fail in the presence of extension headers

   that they do not recognise.

   A contributory factor to this problem is that, because extension
   headers are numbered out of the existing IP Protocol Number space,
   there is no collected list of them.  For this reason, it is hard for
   an implementor to quickly identify the full set of defined extension
   headers.  An implementor who consults only RFC 2460 will miss all
   extension headers defined subsequently.

   The uniform TLV format now defined for extension headers [RFC6564]
   will improve the situation, but only for future extensions.  Some
   tricky cases would be avoided by forbidding very long chains of
   extension headers that might otherwise be fragmented
   [I-D.ietf-6man-oversized-header-chain].

   However, these changes are insufficient to correct the underlying
   problem.  The present document clarifies that the above requirement
   from RFC 2460 applies to all types of node that forward IPv6 packets
   and to all extension headers defined now and in the future.  It also
   requests IANA to create a subsidiary registry that clearly identifies
   extension header types, and updates RFC 2780 accordingly.  However,
   fundamental changes to the IPv6 extension header architecture are out
   of scope for this document.

   Also, Hop-by-Hop options are not handled by many high speed routers,
   or are processed only on a slow path.  This document also updates the
   requirements for processing the Hop-by-Hop options header to make
   them more realistic.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Requirement to Transmit Extension Headers

   The IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options header SHOULD be processed by
   intermediate nodes as described in [RFC2460].  However, it is to be
   expected that high performance routers will either ignore it, or
   assign packets containing it to a slow processing path.  Designers
   planning to use a Hop-by-Hop option should be aware of this likely
   behaviour.

   As a reminder, in RFC 2460, it is stated that the Hop-by-Hop Options
   header, if present, must be first.

   Apart from that, any node along an IPv6 packet's path, which forwards
   it for any reason, SHOULD do so regardless of any extension headers



Carpenter & Jiang         Expires May 17, 2013                  [Page 4]

   that are present, as described in RFC 2460.  Exceptionally, if this
   node is designed to examine extension headers for any reason, such as
   firewalling, it MUST recognise and deal appropriately with all IPv6
   extension header types.  The list of currently defined extension
   header types is maintained by IANA (see Section 4).

   RFC 2460 requires destination hosts to discard packets containing
   unrecognised extension headers.  However, intermediate forwarding
   nodes MUST NOT do this by default, since that might cause them to
   inadvertently discard traffic using a recently defined extension
   header, not yet recognised by the intermediate node.

   As mentioned above, firewalls that violate RFC 2460 by discarding
   packets containing extension headers are known to cause connectivity
   failures.  Therefore, it is important that firewalls are capable of
   parsing all defined IPv6 extension headers and behave according to
   the above requirements.  If a firewall chooses to discard a packet
   containing a defined IPv6 extension header, it MUST be the result of
   an explicitly configured firewall policy, and not just the result of
   a failure to recognise such a header.  To be clear, this means that
   the default configuration of a firewall MUST NOT cause defined
   extension headers to be discarded.  Explicit configuration of a
   discard policy is needed to change this.

   The IPv6 Routing Header Types 0 and 1 have been deprecated and SHOULD
   NOT be used.  However, as specified in [RFC5095], this does not mean
   that the IPv6 Routing Header can be unconditionally dropped by
   forwarding nodes.  Packets containing undeprecated Routing Headers
   MUST be forwarded by default.  At the time of writing, these include
   Type 2 [RFC6275], Type 3 [RFC6554], and Types 253 and 254 [RFC4727].
   Others may be defined in future.


3.  Security Considerations

   Firewall devices MUST conform to the requirements in the previous
   section in order to respect the IPv6 extension header architecture.
   In particular, packets containing specific extension headers are only
   to be discarded as a result of explicit policy, and never as a result
   of the default configuration.

   When new extension headers are defined in the future, those
   implementing and configuring firewalls will need to take account of
   them.  It is to be expected that this process will be slow.  Until it
   is complete, the new extension will fail in some parts of the
   Internet.  This aspect needs to be considered when deciding to
   standardise a new extension.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to clearly mark in the Assigned Internet Protocol
   Numbers registry those values which are also IPv6 Extension Header
   types, for example by adding an extra column to indicate this.  This
   will also apply to any IPv6 Extension Header types defined in the
   future.

   Additionally, IANA is requested to replace the existing empty IPv6
   Next Header Types registry by an IPv6 Extension Header Types
   registry.  It will contain only those protocol numbers which are also
   marked as IPv6 Extension Header types in the Assigned Internet
   Protocol Numbers registry.  The initial list will be as follows:
   o  0, Hop-by-Hop Options, [RFC2460]
   o  43, Routing, [RFC2460], [RFC5095]
   o  44, Fragment, [RFC2460]
   o  50, Encapsulating Security Payload, [RFC4303]
   o  51, Authentication, [RFC4302]
   o  58, ICMPv6, [RFC2460]
   o  59, No Next Header, [RFC2460]
   o  60, Destination Options, [RFC2460]
   o  135, MIPv6, [RFC6275]
   o  139, HIP, [RFC5201]
   o  140, shim6, [RFC5533]

   The references to the IPv6 Next Header field in [RFC2780] are to be
   interpreted as also applying to the IPv6 Extension Header field.
