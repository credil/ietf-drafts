              IANA Guidance for Managing the ULE Registry
                   draft-fairhurst-ipdvb-ule-iana-00

Abstract

   This document proposes an update to RFC 4326 to clarify and update
   the allocation rules for the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
   (ULE) next header registry.  This registry is used by ULE and Generic
   Stream Encapsulation (GSE) to record the codepoints of extension
   headers and protocols supported by these encapsulation protocols.

Internet-Draft             IANA ULE guidelines             February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) [RFC4326]
   specifies an encapsulation for links that employ the MPEG-2 Transport
   Stream, with support over a wide variety of physical-layer bearers
   [RFC4259].  The encapsulation header includes a Type field that
   identifies payload types and extension headers (e.g.[RFC5163]).  The
   ULE specification requested IANA to maintain the ULE next header
   registries to record the allocation of the values used to construct
   this Type field.

   The Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) Project has published an
   encapsulation for second-generation DVB physical layers.  This
   specifies the Generic Stream Encapsulation [GSE].  This encapsulation
   shares many of the network properties of ULE and uses a common format
   for the Type field [RFC5163].  The ULE Next Header registries are
   therefore also applicable to this encapsulation.

1.1.  The ULE Next Header Registries

   The Mandatory Extension Headers registry allocates values in the
   range 0-255.  These values are used to identify mandatory extension
   headers.  The registered value corresponds to the 16-bit Type value
   for the mandatory extension header or the specified protocol.

   The Optional Extension Headers registry allocates values in the range
   256-512.  These values are used to identify optional extension
   headers.  The registered value corresponds to the 16-bit Type value
   that would be used for an optional extension header with a length
   (H-LEN) of 1.


2.  Terminology

   This document assumes familiarity with the terminology of ULE
   [RFC4326] and [RFC5163].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Updated IANA guidance on allocation in the ULE Next Header Registry

   The rules for allocation are defined in section 11 of RFC 4326.
   Requirements for the request of a registry entry are provided in RFC
   4326.  This document updates these rules in the following way:

   Allocations in the ULE Next Header Registry are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "Expert Review" policy defined in [RFC5226].
   Applications for registration are expected to include a reference to
   a published specification of the extension in a standards document
   (e.g. such a reference to an RFC).  The requirements for
   specification of the two types of extension header are in section 11
   of RFC 4326.

   XXX An alternate approach to writing this section could be to include
   a complete replacement text, based on RFC 4326 IANA considerations.
   XXX

3.1.  Reservation of port values

   This document reserves the range decimal 144-159 (0x80-0x8F).  These
   reserved values are presently not available for general assignment,
   and will not be allocated until the registry is exhausted.


4.  Update to registry information

   This section requests IANA to record additional explanatory note in
   the registry:

   "The Mandatory Extension Headers registry allocates values in the
   range 0-255.  These values are used to identify mandatory extension
   headers.  The registered value corresponds to the 16-bit Type value
   for the mandatory extension header or the specified protocol.

   The Optional Extension Headers registry allocates values in the range
   256-512.  These values are used to identify optional extension
   headers.  The registered value corresponds to the 16-bit Type value
   that would be used for an optional extension header with a length
   (H-LEN) of 1."


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present new security considerations.


6.  IANA Considerations

   Section 3 specifies updated IANA allocation rules

   Section 4 requests IANA to update the registry information.
