Internet-Draft                   6rd MIB                   February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This draft describes the Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment, [RFC5969]), which specifies an automatic
   tunneling mechanism to deploy IPv6 to sites via a operator's IPv4
   network.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The MIB Module specified herein provides one way to manage the 6rd
   devices through SNMP.

4.1.  sixRdTable

   This table contains the configuration information for 6rd.

4.2.  sixRdBrIpv4AddressTable

   This table contains the BR IPv4 Address for configurations on given
   6rd CE device.

Internet-Draft                   6rd MIB                   February 2013


5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

5.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The SAMPLE-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

5.2.  Relationship to the IP Tunnel MIB

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] contains objects common to all IP
   tunnels, including 6rd.  Additionally, tunnel encapsulation specific
   MIB (like what is defined in this document) extend the IP tunnel MIB
   to further describe encapsulation specific information, for example
   (in case of 6rd): 6rd prefix, 6rd Prefix Length, IPv4Mask Length and
   BR IPv4 Address.

   The implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB is required for 6rd.  The
   tunnelIfEncapsMethod in the tunnelIfEntry should be set to
   sixRd("xx"), and an entry in the 6rd MIB module will exist for every
   tunnelIfEntry with this tunnelIfEncapsMethod.  The
   tunnelIfRemoteAddress must be set to 0.0.0.0.

   [Ed.Note:]This is similar to the situation of L2TP MIB [RFC3371]
   case, since the IANA is requested to assign a value for sixRdMIB
   under the "transmission" subtree.  Also, a new IANAtunnelType (rather
   than IANAifType) value is needed and should be recorded in the
   IANAifType-MIB registry, refer to Section 8.

5.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   This MIB module IMPORTs objects from [RFC4087], [RFC2580], [RFC2578],
   [RFC2863], [RFC3411].
