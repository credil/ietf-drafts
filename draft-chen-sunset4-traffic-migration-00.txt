              Graceful IPv4 Sunset with Traffic Migration
                draft-chen-sunset4-traffic-migration-00

Abstract

   In order to make a graceful IPv4 sunset, this memo described a method
   helping traffic migration to IPv6.  With the growth of IPv6 traffic,
   operators could safely turn off IPv4 and evolve to IPv6-only network.
   In order to achieve the goal, new traffic-migration options have been
   proposed in DHCPv6 and PCP.  IPv6 traffic steering could be performed
   using those configurations.

1.  Introduction

   The working group of Sunset4 was targeted to standardize technologies
   that facilitate the graceful sunsetting of the IPv4 Internet in the
   context of the exhaustion of IPv4 address space while IPv6 is
   deployed.  This memo has described the way to incrementally turn off
   the IPv4 by steering traffic to IPv6 networks.

   As imminent demands to IP address, the community has to seek a way to
   accelerate IPv6.  However, the tremendous success of the Internet has
   adhered to IPv4 technologies.  ISPs don't want to significantly
   changed its IPv4 network.  Dual stack[RFC4213] was designed to
   provide complete support for both Internet protocols.  It's the
   simplest deployment model to enable IPv4 hosts to access the IPv4
   Internet and IPv6 hosts to access the IPv6 Internet.  With the
   thoughtful considerations, e.g. happy eyeballs[RFC6555], white-
   listing[RFC6589], dual-stack approach could ensure user experiences
   as original as possible.

   [RFC6180]recommended the native dual-stack connectivity model.  Some
   ISPs have already successfully deployed dual-stack networks, in which
   the dual-stack capable devices integrate both IPv6 and IPv4
   forwarding.  In those cases, IPv4 and IPv6 data flows are ships-in-
   the-night.  [RFC6264]commentated such transition mechanism may be
   lack of drive to motive IPv6 growth, since most end users are not
   sufficiently expert to configure or maintain host-based IPv6
   transition.  If there are no IPv4 sunset technologies, IPv4
   connectivity and traffic would still continue to represent the
   majority of traffic in most ISP networks.

   The IPv4 sunset should be graceful.  The arbitrary IPv4 turning off
   may don't help the IPv6 acceleration, but exacerbate the situation of
   instable IPv6 connections and IPv4 incompability.  [RFC6586] has
   stated the concerns in a IPv6-only environment.  It should be avoided
   during the period of IPv4 sunset, especially in a commercial network.
   Under those considerations, traffic migration could achieve the
   graceful process with no impacts to services.  This memo enumerates
   several migration technologies in Section 3.  The corresponding
   configurations have been described afterwards.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Traffic Migration Technologies

   With the stress of IP address shortage, switching the whole ISP
   network into IPv6-only would be considered a ultimate strategy.  A
   number of IPv6 transition technologies were proposed.  Some of them
   may likely be less optimal than equivalent technologies for native IP
   connections, i.e.  IPv6-only and dual-stack networks.  Whereas, it
   could help migrate IPv4 traffic to IPv6 network that is transparent
   to user's experiences.  The Figure show the architecture those
   technologies apply to .

     +---+ IPv4   +-----+     IPv4     +-----+  IPv4   /----------\
     | UE|--------|Dual |--------------|     |--------/            \

                             |Server|
                             +------+

                 Figure 1: Traffic Migration architecture

   Traffic migration technologies could shift IPv4 traffic to IPv6
   links.  Meanwhile, the issues of IPv4 compability have been
   thoroughly considered and addressed in those technologies.  The
   migration enforcement could be located on a end-host or dual-stack
   CPE.  Translations or tunnel could be performed at an enforcement
   point.  Following enumerates relevant technologies.

   o  Dual-stack Lite: it employs IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel on CPE.  The
      packages would be encapsulated in IPv6 and transmitted.  GW would
      decapsulate the IPv6 packages and perform IPv4/IPv4 NAT[RFC6333].
      It should be noted that several technologies have been discussed
      in Softwires working group recently.  Those technologies could
      also successfully switch traffic to IPv6 network.

   o  464xlat: it employs double translation
      framework[I-D.ietf-v6ops-464xlat].  CPE could receive IPv4
      packages and make stateless translation[RFC6145] to IPv6.  GW
      adopts stateful NAT64 [RFC6146]processing.

   o  BIH: It employs host based translation[RFC6535].  Embedded BIH
      module could translate IPv4 packages into IPv6 on a host.  Such
      process is transparent to IPv4 applications.

   At a sunset stage, a devices(e.g. a host or CPE) would observe the
   appearance of enabling messages to discover the availability of

   migration technology.  Thus, when an ISP decides to switch their
   traffic to IPv6, the devices would detect and switch automatically to
   traffic-migration mode.


4.  Configurations with DHCPv6 Options

   Enabling traffic migration could be achieved via DHCPv6.  The
   migration DHCPv6 option is proposed as below to inform the device
   performing the traffic steering process.  The format of the migration
   option is shown in Figure 2.

                     mechanism to be performed

                   Figure2: Migration Option for DHCPv6

   The DHCPv6 client MUST include the OPTION_Migration option code in
   the Option Request Option[RFC3315].

   [Editor note: the mechanism filed informs the device that the
   specific technology should be taken.  This is very depending on the
   ISP strategy and implementations.  Weighting different options is
   surely going beyond the scope of this document.  Therefore, it should
   be decided whether the particular semantics should be defined in the
   draft.]


5.  Configurations with PCP Options

   It's also feasible to deliver such message in a NAT environment,
   where there is coexistence of NAT44 and NAT64 on a network side.  If
   PCP clients are embedded in CPE or UE, new PCP options could help to
   indicate migration preferring.

   The format of migration PCP Option is depicted in Figure 3.

   A PCP Client MAY include a migration PCP Option in a MAP request to
   learn network capability used by an upstream PCP-controlled device.
   A PCP server controlling a NAT SHOULD be configured to return the
   value to indicate if the migration technology should be enable.  When
   allowed, migration PCP Option conveys the value for the selection of
   specific mechanism.

   [Editor note: Same concern applies to the mechanism filed. it should
   be decided whether the particular semantics should be defined in the
   draft. ]
