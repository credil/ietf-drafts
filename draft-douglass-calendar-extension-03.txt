1.  Introduction

   The currently existing iCalendar standard [RFC5545] lacks useful
   methods for referencing additional, external information relating to
   calendar components.









Douglass                Expires December 07, 2013               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar       June 2013


   This document defines a number of properties referencing external
   information that can provide additional information about an
   iCalendar component.  The intent is to allow interchange of such
   information between applications or systems (e.g., between clients,
   between client and server, and between servers).  Formats such as
   VCARD are likely to be most useful.

   In addition a new property is defined to support HTML descriptions.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Typed References

   The properties defined here can all reference external meta-data
   which may be used by applications to provide enhanced value to users.
   By providing type information as parameters, clients and servers are
   able to discover interesting references and make use of them, perhaps
   for indexing or the presentation of additional related information
   for the user.

   These properties are designed to handle common use cases in event
   publication.  It is generally important to provide information about
   the organizers of such events.  Sponsors wish to be referenced in a
   prominent manner.  In social calendaring it is often important to
   identify the active associates in the event, for example a school
   sports team, and the inactive associates, for example the parents.

   The [RFC5545] LOCATION property provides only an unstructured single
   text value for specifying the location where an event (or "TODO"
   item) will occur.  This is inadequate for use cases where structured
   location information (e.g. address, region, country, postal code) is
   required or preferred, and limits widespread adoption of iCalendar in
   those settings.

   Using STRUCTURED-LOCATION, information about a number of interesting
   locations can be communicated, for example, parking, restaurants and
   the venue.  Servers and clients can retrieve the objects when storing
   the event and use them to index by geographic location.

   When a calendar client receives a calendar component it can search
   the set of supplied properties looking for those of particular
   interest.  The TYPE and FMTTYPE parameters, if supplied, can be used
   to help the selection.

2.1.  Use Cases

   The main motivation for these properties has been event publication
   but there are opportunities for use elsewhere.  The following use
   cases will describe some possible scenarios.

2.1.1.  Piano Concert Performance

   In putting together a concert there are many associates: piano tuner,
   performer, stage hands etc.  In addition there are sponsors and
   various contacts to be provided.  There will also be a number of
   related locations.  A number of events can be created, all of which
   relate to the performance in different ways.

   There may be an iTip meeting request for the piano tuner who will
   arrive before the performance.  Other members of staff may also
   receive meeting requests.

   An event can also be created for publication which will have an
   ASSOCIATE reference to the pianist providing vcard information about
   the performer.  This event would also hold information about parking,
   local subway stations and the venue itself.  In addition, there will
   be sponsorship information for sponsors of the event and perhaps paid
   sponsorship properties essentially advertising local establishments.

2.1.2.  Itineraries

   These properties also provide opportunities for the travel industry.
   When booking a flight the SPONSOR property can be used to provide
   references to businesses at the airports and to car hire businesses
   at the destination.

   The embedded location information can guide the traveller at the
   airport or to their final destination.  The contact information can
   provide detailed information about the booking agent, the airlines
   and car hire companies and the hotel.

3.  Modifications to Calendar Components

   The following changes to the syntax defined in iCalendar [RFC5545]
   are made here.  New elements are defined in subsequent sections.


   eventprop /= *(
                 ;
                 ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                 ; and MAY occur more than once.
                 ;

                 styleddescription / strucloc / strucres / associate
                 ;
                 )

   todoprop /= *(
                ;
                ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                ; and MAY occur more than once.
                ;
                styleddescription / strucloc / strucres / associate
                ;
                )

   jourprop /= *(
                ;
                ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                ; and MAY occur more than once.
                ;
                styleddescription / associate
                ;
                )


4.  Relating Component Properties

   Within a single component we sometimes need to specify which
   properties are related to each other and their state.  For example,
   by relating a STYLED-DESCRIPTION property to the DESCRIPTION property
   and saving an indication of state, clients can know if one of them
   has changed and notify the user.

   This specification defines two new property parameters to enable this
   relating of properties, GROUP and HASH.

   The GROUP parameter provides identifiers for each group within the
   component in which it is specified.  It may be specified on any
   property.

   The HASH parameter is intended to facilitate backwards compatability,
   allowing clients aware of the new STYLED-DESCRIPTION property to
   determine if an older client has modified the DESCRIPTION.

   The value of HASH is the base-64 encoded hashed value of the property
   to which the current property is related







Douglass                Expires December 07, 2013               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar       June 2013


   In the example below a STYLED-DESCRIPTION property is related to the
   DESCRIPTION property both of which have a GROUP value of "DESC".  If
   the DESCRIPTION property value is changed then the hash-value stored
   with the STYLED-DESCRIPTION will no longer match.

       DESCRIPTION;GROUP=DESC:Some Text
       STYLED-DESCRIPTION;GROUP=DESC;HASH="zlWCFIxvDBKCM1uH317Uvkt
        4E5k=,SHA-1":<p>Some Text</p>


5.  New Property Parameters

5.1.  Hash

   Parameter name:  HASH

   Purpose:  To specify the hash value and method of the DESCRIPTION.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

       hashparam = "HASH" "="    /
                      DQUOTE hashval "," hashname DQUOTE
       ; A structured value with the following components:
       hashval = *QSAFE-CHAR
       ; Base64 encoded hash of the value of the property referenced by
       ; the idval segment
       hashname = *QSAFE-CHAR
       ; Name of the hash function used to calculate the hash value


   Description:  This parameter can be specified on STYLED-DESCRIPTION
      and is used to detect changes in that property to enable the
      values of all variants to be kept synchronized.

      The text value is a hash value (encoded as a base-64 string),
      followed by a token describing the algorithm used to calculate the
      hash value.  Algorithm names from the IANA Hash Function Textual
      Names registry [] MUST be used.

      Each element of the value is separated by a COMMA character,

      Clients maintaining multiple versions of a description MAY use
      this parameter to indicate that the associated STYLED-DESCRIPTION
      property needs to be updated, Removing the parameter indicates
      that the property may be out of synch.

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar       June 2013


5.2.  Group

   Parameter name:  GROUP

   Purpose:  To identify groups of properties.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

   groupparam   = "GROUP" "=" paramtext *("," paramtext)


   Description:  This parameter can be specified on any property.  It is
      used to identify properties which are related to other properties
      within the same component.

      Rather than adding extra parameters to properties the GROUP
      parameter allow one or more properties to provide extra metadata.
      For example we may wish to relate some form of status property to
      an ATTENDEE to describe the status of a task.

      It is the responsibility of calendar applications to maintain the
      relationships between grouped items.  Deleting one member of a
      group may imply deleting others or removing GROUP parameters from
      other properties.

5.3.  Loctype

   Parameter name:  LOCTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the type of location.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

   loctypeparam   = "LOCTYPE" "=" param-value


   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on STRUCTURED-LOCATION
      and provides a way to differentiate multiple properties.  For
      example, it allows event producers to provide location information
      for the venue and the parking.

      Values for this parameter are taken from the values defined in
      [RFC5545].  New location types SHOULD be registered in the manner
      laid down in that specification

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar       June 2013


5.4.  Assoctype

   Parameter name:  ASSOCTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the type of associate.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

   assoctypeparam   = "ASSOCTYPE" "=" param-value


   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the ASSOCIATE
      property, and defines the type of association.  Allowable values
      are defined in Section 7.

5.5.  Restype

   Parameter name:  RESTYPE

   Purpose:  To specify the type of resource.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

   restypeparam   = "RESTYPE" "=" param-value


   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on STRUCTURED-RESOURCE
      and provides a way to differentiate multiple properties.

      Values for this parameter are taken from the values defined in
      [todo].  New resource types SHOULD be registered in the manner
      laid down in that specification

5.6.  Order

   Parameter name:  ORDER

   Purpose:  To define ordering for the associated property.

   Format Definition:







Douglass                Expires December 07, 2013               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar       June 2013


   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

   orderparam    = "ORDER" "=" integer ;Must be in the range [1..100]


   Description:  The ORDER parameter is OPTIONAL and is used to indicate
      the relative ordering of the corresponding instance of a property.
      Its value MUST be an integer between 1 and 100 that quantifies the
      order.  Lower values correspond to a higher level of ordering,
      with 1 being the highest.

      When the parameter is absent, the default MUST be to interpret the
      property instance as being at the lowest level of ordering.

      Note that the value of this parameter is to be interpreted only in
      relation to values assigned to other corresponding instances of
      the same property in the same entity.  A given value, or the
      absence of a value, MUST NOT be interpreted on its own.

      This parameter MAY be applied to any property that allows multiple
      instances.

5.7.  Label

   Parameter name:  LABEL

   Purpose:  To provide a human readable label.

   Format Definition:

   This parameter is defined by the following notation:

   labelparam     = "LABEL" "=" DQUOTE text DQUOTE


   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on STYLED-DESCRIPTION,
      ASSOCIATE, STRUCTURED-LOCATION and STRUCTURED-RESOURCE and
      provides a human readable label, perhaps for icons or links..

6.  New Properties

6.1.  Associate

   Property name:  ASSOCIATE

   Purpose:  This property provides a typed reference to external
      information about associates in an event or optionally a plain
      text typed value.

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar       June 2013


   Value type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to TEXT to indicate plain text content.

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, label, assoctype, order or format
      type parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  When used in a component the value of this property
      points to information about an event associate.  This is NOT an
      attendee in a scheduling sense and the ATTENDEE property may in
      fact be specified in addition.  Associates in events can be
      individuals or organizations, for example a soccer team, the
      spectators, or the musicians.

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     associate     = "ASSOCIATE" assocparam
                       (
                         ";" "VALUE" "=" "URI"
                         ":" uri)  /
                       (
                         ";" "VALUE" "=" "TEXT"
                         ":" text
                       )
                       CRLF

     assocparam      = *(

                     ; the following are OPTIONAL
                     ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                     (";" fmttypeparam) /
                     (";" labelparam) /
                     (";" orderparam) /
                     (";" assoctypeparam) /
                     (";" groupparam) /

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" other-param)

                     )



   Note:  When the ORDER parameter is supplied it defines the ordering
      of ASSOCIATE properties with the same value for the TYPE
      parameter.

   Example:

   The following is an example of this property.  It points to a VCARD
   providing information on an event associate.

                 ASSOCIATE;ASSOCTYPE=PRINCIPAL_PERFORMER:
                   http://dir.example.com/vcard/aviolinist.vcf

   Example:

   The following is an example of the property used to link to VCARD
   information on the event planner.

                 ASSOCIATE;FMTTYPE=text/vcard;
                   ASSOCTYPE=PLANNER-CONTACT;LABEL=ClownsIsUs:
                   http://dir.example.com/vcard/clowns-is-us.vcf


6.2.  Styled-Description

   Property name:  STYLED-DESCRIPTION

   Purpose:  This property provides for one or more rich-text
      descriptions to replace or augment that provided by the
      DESCRIPTION property.

   Value type:  There is no default value type for this property.  The
      value type can be set to URI or TEXT.  Other text-based value
      types can be used when defined in the future.  Clients MUST ignore
      any properties with value types they do not understand.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, hash, id, alternate text
      representation, and language property parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance:  The property can be specified multiple times in the
      "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL", or "VALARM" calendar components.

   Description:  This property is used in the "VEVENT" and "VTODO" to
      capture lengthy textual descriptions associated with the activity.
      This property is used in the "VJOURNAL" calendar component to
      capture one or more textual journal entries.  This property is
      used in the "VALARM" calendar component to capture the display
      text for a DISPLAY category of alarm, and to capture the body text
      for an EMAIL category of alarm.

      VALUE=TEXT is used to provide rich-text variants of the plain-text
      DESCRIPTION property.

Internet-Draft  Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar       June 2013


      VALUE=URI is used to provide a link to rich-text content which is
      expected to be displayed inline as part of the event.

      The "HASH" parameter value is calculated from the value of any
      "DESCRIPTION" property present in the same component.  If no
      "DESCRIPTION" is present, then the "HASH" parameter MUST NOT be
      present.

      The intent of this property is limited to providing a styled and/
      or language specific version of the DESCRIPTION property.  The URL
      property should be used to link to websites or other related
      information.

      Applications MAY attempt to guess the media type of the resource
      via inspection of its content if and only if the media type of the
      resource is not given by the "FMTTYPE" parameter.  If the media
      type remains unknown, calendar applications SHOULD treat it as
      type "text/html".

      Multiple STYLED-DESCRIPTION properties may be used to provide
      different formats or different language variants.  The GROUP
      paramater may be used to relate members of the group This is
      useful for VJOURNAL for example which allows multiple, unrelated,
      DESCRIPTION properties.
