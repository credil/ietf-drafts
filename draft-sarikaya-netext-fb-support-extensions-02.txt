Internet-Draft      PMIPv6 Support for Flow Mobility           June 2012


1.  Introduction

   In Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] multi-homing is supported efficiently due to
   the use of home address.  Mobile node uses its home address as the
   source address and all incoming traffic is directed to the home
   address (HoA).  When multiple interfaces are concurrently active the
   home agent (HA) has to decide how to route incoming packets to
   different active interfaces.  HA does this based on the flow
   bindings.  MN has to register its active flows with the HA and HA
   keeps flow binding entries for each HoA.  HA then forwards packets to
   one of the care-of addresses of an active interface after matching it
   with an ordered list of flow bindings.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] lacks a similar mechanism because each
   active interface is treated separately and a different binding cache
   entry is created.  This document proposes changes necessary to the
   local mobility anchor (LMA) behaviour so that flow mobility can
   seamlessly be supported in PMIPv6.  The changes to the mobile node
   considered in [I-D.ietf-netext-logical-interface-support] are also
   needed to complement our solution on the host side.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5213], [RFC6089] in addition to the ones specified in this
   section:

   Single-Radio MN:  Consider MN with two interfaces.  These interfaces
      are implemented in such a way that MN can keep one radio module
      (interface) active at a given time.
   Dual/multiple-Radio MN:  Consider MN with two interfaces.  These
      interfaces are implemented in such a way that both radio modules
      can receive and transmit simultaneously.
   Inter-technology handover:  Sometimes called vertical handover.  A
      multi-homed MN communicates with one interface at any time to
      conserve power.  Each interface can support different access
      technology.  Inter-technology handover occurs when MN moves out of
      coverage of one technology and moves into the coverage area of
      another technology which will result in switching of the
      communicating interface on MN
      [I-D.ietf-netext-logical-interface-support].

3.  Problem Statement

   In base Proxy Mobile IPv6 when MN connects simultaneously with
   multiple interfaces each interface is treated independently and MN
   uses different source addresses when sending packet over these
   interfaces [RFC5213].  However in case of flow mobility, MN itself or
   LMA might wish to move one flow from one interface to the other.
   When a flow is moved from interface A to interface B, MN has to stop
   sending packets on interface A, i.e. it should set the source address
   to an address based on HNPs assigned to interface B. Forcing an MN to
   do this after a flow is moved is difficult currently and is one of
   the problems PMIPv6 flow mobility is facing.

   The solution for this is to let MN always use a source address from
   HNPs assigned to its home interface.  When multiple interfaces are
   active, incoming packets can be directed to different active
   interfaces based on flow state established at LMA.

   In based Proxy Mobile IPv6 LMA treats each interface independently of
   the other interface(s) MN may have and tries to provide mobility
   support for each interface.  LMA does not manage bindings from
   different interfaces of the mobile node in an integrated fashion.  So
   LMA can not be in control of moving the flows in between interfaces.

   The solution to this is to modify the way the binding cache is
   managed.  Instead of creating an independent mobility session for
   each interface, the bindings from each interface are kept together so
   that the flows can be moved among interfaces.  The extensions to the
   base protocol needed for this should be minimal.

   When MN does an inter-technology handover, the new MAG sends a Proxy
   Binding Update (PBU) message to the local mobility anchor (LMA) to
   register the new proxy care-of address.  In the PBU, MAG sets the
   access technology type (ATT) and handoff indicator (HI) values.  If
   ATT is different from the one stored in the existing binding cache
   entry for this MN and if HI is set to 2 (Handoff between two
   different interfaces of the mobile node), LMA concludes that an
   inter-technology handover happened and assigns the same home network
   prefix(es) to MN which enables IP session continuity.

   Setting the handoff indicator correctly is also not so easy.  Most
   MAGs would tend to set HI to 1 (Attachment over a new interface)
   which would result in LMA setting new prefix(es) to MN and creating a
   new binding cache entry and allocating a new mobility session for
   this new interface.  This behaviour as described in Section 5.4 of
   [RFC5213] needs to be changed.

4.   Multihoming Case

   When there is attachment over a new interface (HI value received in
   the Binding Update from MAG is 1) LMA creates a new binding cache
   entry and assigns the flag "S" defined in Section 5.1 to all home
   network prefixes assigned to this interface.  Also the corresponding
   value is set to the (H) flag of the home network interface option
   defined in Section 7 in the binding acknowledgement sent to MAG.  LMA
   MUST also include the home network prefixes with "H" flag in the BA
   message.  This should enable MN continue to send packets with source
   addresses selected from HNPs with "H" flag on.

   The new binding cache entry does not create a new mobility session.
   The entry is considered as a pointer to another binding the same MN
   has with LMA.  MN may have as many such binding entries as it has
   active interfaces.  These secondary binding cache entries are
   refreshed regularly by MAGs sending BUs.  MAG MUST include HNPs both
   with "H" and "S" flags in the BU message.  LMA refreshes the binding
   cache entry for the interface with only "S" flag.


5.  LMA Operation

   When LMA receives a Binding Update message which contains Handoff
   Indication set to a value of 1 LMA MUST create a new binding cache
   entry and assign new home network prefixes for this interface.  In
   the binding cache entry these HNPs MUST be flagged with a value of 0
   representing "S".  This binding cache entry becomes part of the
   binding cache entry that contains home network prefixes with "H"
   flag.  "H" and "S" flags are as defined in Section 5.1.

   LMA sends home network prefixes assigned to the new interface in the
   Binding Acknowledgement message.  LMA MUST also set the (H) Flag in
   HNP option to 0.  In the same BA message, LMA MAY also send home
   network prefixes whose (H) flag is set to 1 in the same BA.

   The modifications specified in this document allow a mobile node to
   have a single interface connected at a given moment and that
   interface has prefixes assigned an "S" flag, i.e. the binding with
   the home interface may have expired.  In this case LMA MUST also
   store the home network prefixes with "H" flag in the binding cache
   entry.

5.1.  Extensions to Binding Cache Entry

   One flag associated with the following binding cache entry: list of
   IPv6 home network prefixes assigned to the mobile node's connected
   interface and prefix length.  The flag is set to 1 representing "H"



Sarikaya & Xia          Expires December 9, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      PMIPv6 Support for Flow Mobility           June 2012


   if the connected interface is the home interface and flag is set to 0
   representing "S" if the connected interface is not the home interface
   but it is one of the secondary interfaces.

   The prefixes assigned after the very first PBU is received for this
   MN are assigned the "H" flag.  The handoff between two different
   interfaces does not require the prefixes to be changed in order to
   allow session continuity.  Because of this the flag (of "H" or "S")
   associated with the prefixes stays the same.

   This specification also brings the change that binding cache entries
   for the same MN-Identifier are considered together.  The number of
   entries is equal to the number of active interfaces of MN.  If there
   is a single entry it is assumed that the flag value is "H", otherwise
   the prefixes with "H" flag should also be stored in the binding cache
   entry.

   For an incoming packet, the destination address MUST be selected from
   the set of prefixes with "H" flag, i.e.  MN always sends non-local
   packets with source address assigned from HNPs of its home interface.
   LMA decides to which interface to route this packet by consulting the
   flow mobility cache [I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob], similar to the
   case in Mobile IPv6 [RFC6089].  The packet will be matched against
   the flow descriptions [RFC6088] in the flow mobility cache and Proxy-
   CoA of the matching entry will be determined.  Next, binding cache
   entry for this MN will be searched and the packet will be directed to
   the MAG to which the matching interface is connected.


6.  MAG Operation

   When MAG detects an attachment over a new interface it sets Handoff
   Indicator field to 1 as described in [RFC5213] in the Binding Update
   message that it sends to LMA.

   MAG MUST store home network prefixes it receives in Binding
   Acknowledgement message from LMA together with the flag in the
   binding update list entry.  If the flag is "S" MAG MUST also store
   all home network prefixes in the BA message whose flag is "H" in the
   corresponding binding update list entry.  There will be a maximum of
   two sets of HNPs for each MN if the MAG is not connected to the home
   interface.

   MAG receives packets from LMA, decapsulates them and searches the
   binding update list to find the corresponding enrty (with the "H"
   flag) and sends them to the MN with the corresponding "S" flag.

6.1.  Extensions to Binding Update List Entry Data Structure

   A flag associated with the following binding update list entry: list
   of IPv6 home network prefixes assigned to the mobile node's connected
   interface the corresponding prefix length.  The flag is set to 0
   representing "H" if the connected interface is the home interface and
   is set to 1 representing "S" if the connected interface is not.

   MAG MUST also store the home network prefixes with flag "H" in
   addition to the prefixes associated with the connected interface if
   the flag of the home network prefix assigned to the connected
   interface is "S".  MAG determines these flag values from the home
   network prefix option's (H) flag.


7.  Message Formats

   Home Network Prefix Option defined in [RFC5213] is modified to
   include a flag to indicate if home network prefixes are assocaited
   with "H" flag or "S" flag in the binding cache entries.

   This specification extends the Home Network Prefix Option with a new
   flag.  The flag is shown and described below.  All other fields are
   as described in [RFC5213].

        0                   1                   2                   3

                   Figure 1: Home Network Prefix Option

   H Flag

      This flag is set to 1 when this prefix is assigned to a secondary
      interface of the mobile node, i.e. when the binding cache entry
      for this HNP has "S" flag set.  This flag is set to 0 when this
      prefix is assigned to the firstly connecting or the only connected
      interface of the mobile node, i.e. when the binding cache entry

      for this HNP has "H" flag set.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define any new security issues.  PMIPv6
   security procedures apply.


9.  IANA considerations

   IANA is requested to add the H Flag into the reserved field in Home
   Network Prefix Option defined in Section 8.3 in [RFC5213] as the
   first bit, i.e.  Bit number 16 and change the Reserved (R) field as
   follows:

   This 7-bit field is unused for now.  The value MUST be initialized to
   0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.
