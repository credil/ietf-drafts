     Label-based Provider-Provisioned Lawful Intercept for L3 VPNs
          draft-balaji-mpls-lawful-intercept-thru-label-dis-03


Abstract

   In models of Single-AS and inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) Lawful
   Intercept is a key requirement. For example, MPLS-based Layer 3 VPN
   models do not have any provider provisioned methods of lawful
   intercept that are comprehensive, quick and easy to provision from
   one single point. More particularly the auto-provisioning of lawful
   intercept for all sets of streams travelling between VPN sites and
   consequent re-direction of these streams to the appropriate
   government network has not been covered without multiple instances of
   having to configure the intercept at various points in the network
   both in the Single-AS case and the Inter-Provider VPN case.

   In this paper, we propose a technique which uses a set of pre-defined
   labels called Lawful Intercept labels and a method for provisioning
   lawful intercept amongst the various PE devices using these labels
   both in the Single-AS and the inter-provider VPN cases. A single
   point of action is the key to this idea. The intercepted traffic is
   mirrored on a PE or a whole set of PEs or on all the PEs
   participating in the VPN. A technique called the Domino-effect
   provisioning of these Label-based Provider Provisioned Lawful
   Intercept mechanism is also outlined.

INTERNET DRAFT  Label-based Lawful Intercept for L3 VPNs   February 2013


1  Introduction

   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) [6] technology uses fixed size
   labels to forward data packets between routers. By stacking labels,
   specific customer services such as Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks
   (L3-VPNs) based on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) extensions are
   widely deployed in the Internet. BGP-based MPLS L3-VPN services are
   provided either on a single Internet Service Provider (ISP) core or
   across multiple ISP cores. The latter cases are known as inter-
   provider MPLS L3-VPNs which are broadly categorized and referred to
   as models: "A", "B" and "C".

   In all the above cases both Single-AS and inter-provider VPN cases
   for Layer 3 VPNs it is important that the provider or multiple
   providers have a co-ordinated mechanism of lawfully intercepting
   traffic to and from Provider Edge Routers (PEs) belonging to one or
   more VPN instances.

   This paper outlines a label-based Provider Provisioning technique
   that helps to provide a single point of action for lawfully
   intercepting through traffic mirroring or other such techniques of
   data flowing to and from one or more PEs or all of the PEs that
   constitute a particular VPN instance. More than one VPN  instance may
   be configured with this technique. Also Enhanced Remote SPAN with GRE
   keying mechanism is used to transport the intercepted packets to a
   Lawful Intercept device where it may be examined and analyzed by
   Government Authorities.

   In the spirit of RFC 2804 and given that RFC 3924 that already
   exists, this mechanism can be considered from the point of view of an
   Experimental draft. No other opinion is professed except to document
   this as a possible method to use in times of crisis and emergency. In
   the spirit of 2804 which states and we quote...

   - On the other hand, the IETF believes that mechanisms designed to
   facilitate or enable wiretapping, or methods of using other
   facilities for such purposes, should be openly described, so as to
   ensure the maximum review of the mechanisms and ensure that they
   adhere as closely as possible to their design constraints. The IETF
   believes that the publication of such mechanisms, and the publication
   of known weaknesses in such mechanisms, is a Good Thing."

   End of Quote.

   Hence we submit this document for review in the spirit of what is
   said above.

INTERNET DRAFT  Label-based Lawful Intercept for L3 VPNs   February 2013


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Methodology of the proposal

2.1 PRE-REQUISITES FOR THE LABEL-BASED Provider-Provisioned SCHEME for
   LI

   In this section, we briefly review the pre-requisites for applying
   this technique in terms of the PE configuration and the control-plane
   exchanges needed for our proposed scheme.

2.1.1 Configuring Lawful Intercept for a specific VPN instance on a
   specific PE

   The regular mechanisms using SNMP using the TAP-MIB can be used to
   configure the requirement to intercept traffic going to and from a
   given PE router. This very mechanism is used to initiate the scheme
   mentioned in this document. 

2.1.2.1 PE configuration

   Various configurations are needed on the PEs to implement the label
   based Lawful Intercept scheme. A set of pre-defined labels called the
   Lawful Intercept labels are provided for a VPN instance that is
   configured on the PE. In the simplest case one single Lawful
   Intercept label may be used per VPN instance . In this draft, we
   assume that a single label based lawful intercept is used per VPN
   instance per PE for cases where the whole VPN site traffic needs to
   be trapped. For cases where specific flows are required to be
   monitored section 2.2.4 outlines the necessary actions to be taken.

2.1.3 Control and data-plane flow

   Initially, the usual control plane exchanges take place where the
   labels configured for the Layer 3 VPN instance between the various
   PEs participating for that VPN instance are exchanged securely over
   the control-plane.

   Appropriate Lawful Intercept labels are configured or a knob that
   allocates them automatically is configured. These labels are not
   exchanged at the time when the LI based mechanism is not in place,
   meaning the TAP-MIBs are not yet setup for LI for a VPN instance.

INTERNET DRAFT  Label-based Lawful Intercept for L3 VPNs   February 2013


   Appropriate ports that will mirror these LI intercepted frames are
   set up and pre-provisioned with links to the devices that will
   analyze the data when such interception occurs.

   Once the secure control-plane exchanges are completed, normal traffic
   starts to flow. It is possible then that an event occurs which
   results in a PE being configured for Lawful Intercept to take place.
   Such an event could be a police tipoff, external intelligence inputs
   and other events. The exact set of events that will trigger LI are
   outside the scope of this document. Once the PE (which we will call
   the dPE) is configured with this, the control plane for example MP-
   BGP (where BGP is used for control plane exchanges), then sends over
   the LI label to the other PEs of the same VPN instance. These other
   PEs called the sPEs (or the source PEs for short), then install this
   LI label to be the inner label or the VPN service label in their
   packets they send to the dPE. Appropriate ACLs configured for
   intercepting packets coming into the dPE with the LI label route the
   traffic to the mirroring port on the dPE. This is then encapsulated
   in a GRE tunnel and sent over to the Government network after
   suitable encryption if necessary.

2.2 Domino-effect technique 

   In this case called the Domino-effect technique, all sPEs receiving
   control plane exchanges with an indication that a LI label is being
   requested to be installed on them in turn also send their respective
   LI labels to other PEs in distinct control plane exchanges. This will
   result in the entire VPNs traffic being monitored at the various
   participating PEs for that VPN.

   An appropriate indicator in the control plane exchange, in the case
   of BGP for example, a special tag in the NLRI information would
   indicate that this is an LI label. As already mentioned appropriate
   Access Control Entries (ACEs) in the PEs will direct the traffic
   coming in with these LI labels to the mirroring ports, one or more if
   any.

   The inner label information is mapped to a GRE key and the mirrored
   packets at the intercepting dPE are sent with this GRE key in place
   with of course the GRE encapsulation to the analyzing network
   devices. Additional information as to which sPE the traffic came from
   is thus added to the packet in the form of the GRE key. The exact
   means of this technique is upto the implementer to take up.

2.2.0 Per-Prefix label to Per-VRF LI label

   If the configuration on the dPE is to disseminate per-prefix labels
   then the introduction of the LI label is such that it (the LI label)

INTERNET DRAFT  Label-based Lawful Intercept for L3 VPNs   February 2013


   is advertised as a an aggregate per-VRF label so that all of the
   traffic is bunched together in the transmit and/or the receive
   direction to the dPE and from the dPE pivoting around an appropriate
   single LI label so that it can be easily trapped by the ACE entry in
   the dPE (and if the domino is triggered in the sPEs as well) to get
   mirrored onto one or more ports.

2.2.1 Algorithm 1 Control-plane dPE algorithm

   Require: 
   * K Valid Lawful Intercept labels per VPN for FECs to be monitored 
   * If in case the whole VPN site then a single label
   * else specific LI labels for each prefix to be monitored
   at required granularity as per VRF route entries.

   Begin
   Get event that triggers configuration in the TAP-MIB;

   Get TAP-MIB configured particulars about which VPN and whether 
       FlagTriggerDominoEffect is set;

   packet = makepacket(K[VPN Instance or FECinVPN], 
                       FlagTriggerDominoEffect);

   For all sPEs in the VPN 

   CP-SendPacket(sPE[j], MP-BGP, packet);

   endFor
   End

2.2.2 Algorithm 2 Control-plane sPE algorithm

   Require: None
   Begin
   packet = CP-ReceivePacket(dPE); // from dPE
   Label = ExtractLabel(packet); // extract LI label
   if (Label is LI label as indicated by NLRI information) then
      Set Label in Forwarding table for the VPN;
   endif
   FlagTriggerDominoEffect = ExtractFlags(packet);
   if (FlagTriggerDominoEffect) then
      Run Algorithm 1 on the sPE (as the dPE);
   End

2.2.3 Algorithm 3 Data-plane dPE algorithm

   Require: None

   Begin
   packet = DP-ReceivePacket(Interface);
   if ((Label of packet is == LI label for VPN) &&
       (ACL configured for the said Label))
   then

      mirror packet with all information after mapping
      VPN label to GRE key which indicates dPE;

      Encapsulate packet in GRE header and mirror it 
      to appropriate port;

   endif
   End

2.2.4 Monitoring specific flows

   There would be a necessity to monitor specific flows headed towards
   and from a subnet or a specific IP address within a site. This
   monitoring would be needed to be done at all sites to which this
   subnet or specific IP address within the monitored VRF communicates
   with. For this specific purpose the LI label may be sent from the dPE
   to the sPEs (with say the DominoEffectTrigger Flag set) for the
   specific prefix / subnet / IP address. Though the specific IP address
   cannot be trapped with a prefix entry with the LI label alone,
   specific Access Control Lists may be setup at all dPEs where the
   monitoring takes place to trap the specific IP address in particular.
   The flexibility lies with both the LI label based on prefix and the
   consequent Access Control List configured collaboratively working
   together to monitor the specific IP address or even subnet / prefix.

   The algorithm in 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 apply for the specific flow
   monitoring cases as well.

2.2.5 Hierarchalizing the GRE key

   The GRE key can be organized in a hierarchy with respect to site and
   PE information for a provider who is providing the label based lawful
   intercept. Since the GRE key is a 32 bit entity, the site could be 20
   bit ID with the Provider edge router providing the facility being
   indicated by a 12 bit identifier. The source IP address being the
   indicator of the provider / ISP who is providing the facility the
   hierarchy in the GRE key would indicate the location and the PE
   device from where the frames are being trapped. The intercepting

INTERNET DRAFT  Label-based Lawful Intercept for L3 VPNs   February 2013


   authority could thus figure out in the clutter of information as to
   where the encapsulated frames are being emanated from. A common
   registry for the site identifier could be provided and set in the GRE
   key information thus dilineating information coming from different PE
   devices in different locations. It is suffice to say that a 20 bit
   identifier for the site could cover the location. In turn the site
   identifier could be broken into Country code and Zip code as well in
   the registry.


2.4 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

   Additionally this same idea can be applied for L2-VPNs as well. A
   future draft in this area will be published in due course.

3  Security Considerations

   Encryption of the packets funneled to the analyzing devices needs to
   be considered.


4  IANA Considerations

   Appropriate IANA indicators would have to be provided to exchange the
   set of values that Algorithm 1,2 outlines in order to implement this
