Internet-Draft       Device-Stock-UA HTTP Extension         October 2012


1.  Introduction

   An optional header field, User-Agent was originally defined by
   Hypertext Transfer Protocol RFC 1945 (since superseded by [RFC2616]).
   Its intent was to enable statistical tracking, allow tracing of
   protocol violations, and provide a means for tailoring responses
   based on HTTP user agent limitations, quirks, and capabilities.

   Application developers have long used the user agent string to infer
   user agent capability.  Increasingly, developers are relying on the
   user agent string to infer the capabilities of the hardware,
   firmware, and operating system on which the user agent runs.  For
   example, the user agent string is sometimes used to infer the display
   size or whether the user agent allows access to the device file
   system.  In some cases, the user agent string is used to infer which
   other software may be running in addition to the user agent, such as
   a bundled media player or mapping service.

   This works as follows: when the HTTP client includes a User-Agent
   header field, the value of the header field is compared to a
   datastore of stock or native user agent strings and known
   capabilities of the device on which it is known to run.  Responses
   are then tailored based on the results supplied by this datastore.

   Such content negotiation assumes a one-to-one relationship between
   the value of the User-Agent header field and a device.  However, many
   HTTP clients do not have such a relationship -- third-party web
   browsers that run on top of device operating system software, for
   example.

   To compensate for this, some third-party clients include an
   additional, non-standardized header field.  The value of this header
   field is set to the user agent string of the device's native client.
   In practice, several different non-standard header fields are in use,
   for example: X-OperaMini-Phone-UA, used by Opera Software ASA;
   X-Device-User-Agent; and X-ATT-DeviceId, used by AT&T Inc.

   Applications can use such header fields, when available, to serve
   content optimized for a particular device, such as a mobile phone,
   electronic reader, or tablet computer.  This document standardizes
   the syntax and semantics for the Device-Stock-UA header field for
   this purpose.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Syntax Notations

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234].


4.  Device-Stock-UA

   The Device-Stock-UA HTTP header field is an OPTIONAL header field
   that, when used, discloses the user agent of the native browser for a
   device or operating system.  This is for statistical purposes, as
   well as to tailor responses to particular user agent or device
   constraints.

   When the Device-Stock-UA header field is included with a request,
   other non-standard header fields that report a user agent string may
   be included.

   Third-party browsers that use the same user agent string as the
   device's default browser SHOULD NOT include the Device-Stock-UA
   header field, i.e., its presence indicates the use of something other
   than the default browser user-agent string.

   If the user agent string for the default browser changes, as with an
   operating system update, the Device-Stock-UA header field SHOULD
   mirror this change.

   The parameter names are case-insensitive.  The header field can be
   defined in augmented BNF syntax as:


           Device-Stock-UA = "Device-Stock-UA" ":" (User-Agent)
           User-Agent = <Defined in RFC2616 Section 14.43>

   Example:


       Device-Stock-UA: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3

   The user-agent-string should be retrieved from the firmware, matching
   that of the HTTP client bundled with the firmware.

5.  Use of Device-Stock-UA Header Field

   Entities that provide web analytics services SHOULD use the Device-
   Stock-UA header field (if present) in addition to the User-Agent
   header field in their identification of devices to ensure that
   devices are correctly measured.

   Content publishers may use the Device-Stock-UA header field (if
   present) rather than the User-Agent header field in order to infer
   the nature and capabilities of the underlying device rather than, or
   in addition to, the capabilities of the browser in question.

   Publishers of third-party HTTP-capable clients SHOULD include the
   Device-Stock-UA with each HTTP request in order to enable publishers
   to recognize the underlying device.


6.  Security Considerations

   Because the Device-Stock-UA header field includes hardware and
   operating system/firmware information, it may help an attacker narrow
   the scope of an attack by first targeting client device specific
   vulnerabilities.

   The value of Device-Stock-UA may not correctly represent the hardware
   and software.  It can easily be spoofed on the client or modified
   between the endpoints.

   This header field may reveal more specific information about the user
   agent than would otherwise be the case.  This information could then
   be used for tracking purposes.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies the HTTP header field listed below, which
   should be added to the permanent HTTP header field registry defined
   in [RFC3864].
