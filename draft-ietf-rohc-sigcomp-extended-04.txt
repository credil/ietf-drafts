This document describes how to implement certain mechanisms in
Signaling Compression (SigComp), RFC 3320, which can significantly
improve the compression efficiency compared to using simple
per-message compression.

SigComp uses a Universal Decompressor Virtual Machine (UDVM) for
decompression, and the mechanisms described in this document are
possible to implement using the UDVM instructions defined in RFC 3320.

This document is a product of the Robust Header Compression Working
Group of the IETF.
