    An Architecture for IPv6 over Time Synchronized Channel Hopping
                  draft-thubert-6tsch-architecture-00

Abstract

   This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet
   that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of
   IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by
   Backbone Routers.  Route Computation may be achieved in a centralized
   fashion by a Path Computation Element, in a distributed fashion using
   the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks, or in a mixed
   mode.  The Backbone Routers perform proxy Neighbor discovery
   operations over the backbone on behalf of the wireless device, so
   they can share a same subnet and appear to be connected to the same
   backbone as classical devices.

1.  Introduction

   A new breed of Time Sensitive Networks is being developped to enable
   traffic that is highly sensitive to jitter and quite sensitive to
   latency.  Such traffic is not limited to voice and video, but also
   includes command and control operations such as found in industrial
   automation or in-vehicule sensors and actuators.

Internet-Draft             6tsch-architecture                 March 2013


   At IEEE802.1, the "Audio/Video Task Group", was rename TSN for Time
   Sensitive Networking.  The IEEE802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC)
   has evolved with IEEE802.15.4e which provides in particular the Time
   Synchronized Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode for industrial-type
   applications.  Both provide Deterministic capabities to the point
   that a packet that pertains to a certain flow will cross the network
   from node to node following a very precise schedule, like a train
   leaves intermediate stations at precise times along its path.  The
   time slotted aspect reduce collisions, and saves energy.  The channel
   hopping aspect is a simple and efficient technique to get around
   statistical interference by WIFI emitters.

   This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet
   that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of
   IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by
   backbone routers.  Route Computation may be achieved in a centralized
   fashion by a Path Computation Element (PCE), in a distributed fashion
   using the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), or
   in a mixed mode.  The Backbone Routers perform proxy Ipv6 Neighbor
   Discovery (ND) operations over the backbone on behalf of the wireless
   device, so they can share a same IPv6 subnet and appear to be
   connected to the same backbone as classical devices.

2.  Terminology

   The draft uses terminology defined in
   [I-D.palattella-6tsch-terminology],
   [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd], [RFC5191] and
   [RFC4080].

   It conforms to the terms and models described for IPv6 in [RFC5889]
   and uses the vocabulary and the concepts defined in [RFC4291] for
   IPv6.

3.  Overview and Scope

   The scope of the present work is a subnet that, in its basic
   configuration, is made of a IEEE802.15.4e Time Synchronized Channel
   Hopping (TSCH) [I-D.watteyne-6tsch-tsch-lln-context] MAC Route-Over
   Low Power Lossy Network (LLN).

                       Figure 1: Basic Configuration

   The LLN devices communicate over IPv6 [RFC2460] using the 6LoWPAN
   Header Compression (6LoWPAN HC) [RFC6282].  Neighbor Devices are
   discovered with 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (6LoWPAN ND) [RFC6775] and
   the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [RFC6550]
   enables routing within the LLN.  RPL forms Destination Oriented
   Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) within instances of the protocol,
   each instance being associated with an Objective Function (OF) to
   form a routing topology.  A particular LLN device, usually powered,
   acts as RPL root, 6LoWPAN HC terminator, and LLN Border Router (LBR)
   to the outside.

   An extended configuration of the subnet comprises multiple LLNs.  The
   LLNs are interconnected and synchronized over a backbone, that can be
   wired or wireless.  The backbone can be a classical IPv6 network,
   with Neighbor Discovery operating as defined in [RFC4861] and
   [RFC4862].  The backbone can also support Efficiency aware IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Optimizations
   [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd] in mixed mode as
   described in [I-D.thubert-6lowpan-backbone-router].

   Security is often handled at layer 2 and Layer 4.  Authentication
   during the join process is handled with the Protocol for Carrying
   Authentication for Network Access (PANA) [RFC5191].

   The LLN devices are time-synchronized at MAC level.  The MAC
   coordinator that serves as time source through Enhanced Beacons (EB)
   is loosely coupled with the RPL parent; this way, the time
   synchronization starts at the RPL root and follows the RPL DODAGs
   with no timing loop.

   In the extended configuration, the functionality of the LBR is
   enhanced to that of Backbone Router (BBR).  A BBR is an LBR, but also
   an Energy Aware Default Router (NEAR) as defined in
   [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd].  The BBR performs ND
   proxy operations between the registered devices and the classical ND
   devices that are located over the backbone.  6TSCH BBRs synchronize
   with one another over the backbone, so as to ensure that the multiple
   LLNs that form the IPv6 subnet stay tightly synchronized.  If the
   Backbone is Deterministic (such as defined by the Time Sensitive
   Networking WG at IEEE), then the Backbone Router ensures that the
   end-to-end deterministic behavior is maintained between the LLN and
   the backbone.

   RPL is the routing protocol of choice.  TBD whether there is a need
   to define a 6TSCH OF.

   PCE => group needs to work with PCE WG to define flows to PCE, and
   define how to accomodate PCE routes and reservation.

   BBR => group needs to work woth 6MAN to define ND proxy.  Also need
   BBR sync, time sync between deterministic ethernet and 6TSCH net.

4.  Centralized vs.  Distributed Routing

5.  Functional Flows

6.  Network Synchronization

   The mechanism(s) used for time synchronization is something that we
   might have to reconcile with RPL discovery and maintenance traffic.

   Time synchronization in TSCH is based on three mechanisms:

      Enhanced Beacons

      Enhanced ACKs

      Frame based synchronization

   If a node communicates intermittently (sleepy, battery operated) it
   can also proactively ping its time source and receive time stamps.
   In order to maximize battery life and network throughput, it is
   advisable that RPL ICMP discovery and maintenance traffic (governed
   by the trickle timer) be somehow coordinated with the transmission of
   time synch packets (especially with enhanced beacons).  This could be
   a function of the shim layer or it could be deferred to the device
   management entity.  Any suggestions, ideas on this topic?

7.  TSCH and 6TUS

7.1.  6tus

   6tus is an adaptation layer which is the next higher layer to TSCH
   and which offers a set of commands defining a data and management
   interface.  6tus is defines in [I-D.draft-wang-6tsch-6tus]

   The management interface of 6tus enables an upper layer to schedule
   cells and slotframes in the TSCH schedule.

   If the scheduling entity explicitly specifies the slotOffset/
   channelOffset of the cells to be added/deleted, those cells are



Thubert, et al.        Expires September 12, 2013               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             6tsch-architecture                 March 2013


   marked as "hard".  6tus can not move hard cells in the TSCH schedule.
   Hard cells are typically used by an central PCE.

   6tus contains a monitoring process which monitors the performance of
   cells, and can move a cell in the TSCH schedule when it performs bad.
   This is only applicable to cells which are marked as "soft".  To
   reserve a soft cell, the higher layer does not indicate the
   slotOffset/channelOffset of the cell to add, but rather the resulting
   bandwidth and QoS requirements.  When the monitoring process triggers
   an cell reallocation, the two neighbor motes communication over this
   cells negociate the new position in the TSCH schedule of this cell.

7.2.  Slotframes and Priorities

   6tus uses priority queues to manage concurrent data flows of
   different prioroties.  When a packet is received from an higher layer
   for transmission, the I-MUX module of 6tus inserts that packet in the
   outgoing queue which matches the packet best (DSCP can therefore be
   used).  At each schedule transmit slot, the MUX module looks for the
   frame in all the outgoing queues that best matches the cells.  If a
   frame is found, it is given to TSCH for transmission.

7.3.  Centralized Flow Reservation

   In a centralized setting, a PCE computes the TSCH schedule, and
   communicates with the different nodes in the network to configure
   their TSCH schedule.  Since it has full knowledge of the network's
   topology, the PCE can compute a collision-free schedule, which result
   in a high degree of communication determinism.

   The protocol for the PCE to communicate with the motes is not yet
   defined.  This protocol typically reserves hard cells on the
   transmitter side of a dedicated cell, and the negociation protocol of
   6tus takes care of reserving the same cell on the receiver node.

7.4.  Distributed Flow Reservation

   In a distributed setting, no central PCE in present in the network.
   Nodes use 6tus to reserve soft cells with their neighbors.  Since no
   node has full knowledge of the network's topology and the traffic
   requirements, scheduling collisions are possible, for example because
   of a hidden terminal problem.

Internet-Draft             6tsch-architecture                 March 2013


   A schedule collision can be detected if two motes have multiple
   dedicated cells schedule to one another.  The statistics process of
   6tus can be configure to continuously compute the packet delivery
   ratio of those cells, and the monitoring process of 6tus can declare
   a soft cell to perform bad when that statistics for that cell is
   significantly worse than for the other cell to the same neighbor.

   When this happens, the monitoring process of 6tus moves the cell to
   another location in the 6TSCH schedule, through a re-negociation
   procedure with the neighbor.

   The entity that builds and maintains the schedule in a distributed
   fashion is not yet defined.
