      The Approach for IPv4-only users to access IPv6-only Content
                       draft-sun-behave-v4tov6-01

Abstract

   Current approaches can not solve the scenario that the users from
   IPv4 Internet to access IPv6-only content.  When IPv6 content are
   becoming more and more popular, it is important to ensure that IPv6-
   only content can be reachable from legacy IPv4-only clients via some
   IPv4-only network.  This document proposes two approaches for IPv4-
   only users to access IPv6-only content.  It is designed to cover the
   Scenario 2 in [RFC6144].

Internet-Draft      IPv4 user to access IPv6 Content           July 2013


1.  Introduction

   In [RFC6144], Scenario 2 is an important use case.  Not only could
   servers move directly to IPv6 without trudging through a difficult
   transition period, but they could do so without risk of losing
   connectivity with the IPv4-only Internet.

   Existing solutions have not solved this scenario well.  NAT-
   PT[RFC2766]can be used in this scenario, but it requires a tightly
   coupled DNS Application Level Gateway (ALG) in the translator, and
   have been deprecated by the IETF [RFC4966].  The stateless
   translation solution [RFC6219] can work too, but since each IPv6
   server will consume one IPv4 public address, it is not suitable to
   deploy in situation that operators are running out of IPv4 address.
   [RFC6156] can be used for IPv4 client to communicate with IPv6
   client.  But this requires the IPv4 client and IPv6 client to
   implement a TURN client.  Therefore, it is not suitable for
   C-S(Client-Server) and B-S (Browser-Server) mode.

   [I-D.rfvlb-behave-v6-content-for-v4-clients] can work for IPv4-only
   user to access IPv6 content.  But since it uses private IPv4 address
   to mapping the IPv6 server, it can only be used for IPv4 network to
   reach IPv6 network.

   This document is designed for IPv4 Internet to reach IPv6 network.
   There are several requirements in this design:

      1.Considering IPv4 address has been a scarce resource, the amount
      of public IPv4 addresses consumed by the translator should be less
      than that the number of IPv6 servers in the IPv6 network.

      2.  It should not require extra modifications on the server, e.g.
      by using a dynamic port number, implementing TURN client, etc.

   In this document, we propose two approaches for this scenario.  These
   two approaches can make use of existing DNS architecture.  The
   binding table in these two approaches are static.  Therefore, there
   will be no dynamic issue as in NAT-PT or DNS cache syncronization.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   IPv6-converted addresses: IPv4 addresses used to represent IPv6 nodes
   in an IPv4 Internet.  They have an explicit mapping relationship to
   IPv6 addresses.

   NAT46: a stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation functionality.  It is
   consistent with IP/ICMP translation [RFC6145], and can also support
   IPv6-converted address selection and binding table maintenance.


3.  The NAT46 translator for IPv4 Internet to access IPv6 network

   The NAT46 solution is used for IPv4 clients in IPv4 Internet to reach
   IPv6 servers (depicted in Figure 1).

       Figure 1: Overall solution for IPv4 Internet to IPv6 network

   In order to achieve the translation initiated from IPv4 side, two
   addresses need to be determined by NAT46 translator.  The first one
   is the IPv6-converted address of the IPv6 server, which is is
   selected from the IPv4 address pool configured in NAT46.  The second
   one is the IPv4-converted address for the IPv4 client, which can be
   synthetized using the stateless approach defined in [RFC6052].

   In our approach, the mapping relationship between IPv6-converted
   address and the IPv6 address for the server is pre-determined in
   advance.  As a result, the A record in the DNS server for a
   particular server is always the same for different IPv4 clients.


4.  Approach 1: DNS-based solution

   This approach is independent of translated protocol.  For
   applications without DNS process can not be solved by this approach.
   In order to support IPv4 address sharing for multiple IPv6 servers,
   one IPv4 address can be shared by multiple servers with different
   service ports.  If there are too many servers with the same service

   port, the second approach can be used as a complement.

   The overall solution is depicted in Figure 3.

   It consists of several functionalities:

   1.NAT46: This functionality achieves the translation between IPv4
   packet and IPv6 packet.  It is consistent with [RFC6145].  Besides,
   it maintained the binding table including the IPv6 server address,
   IPv6-converted address for IPv6 server, and the service port
   statically.

   2.DNS: The DNS server is configured with the IPv6-converted address
   as the A record for IPv6 server.

   The workflow of this apporach is as follows:

                 Figure 3: Workflow of DNS-based approach

   1.  An IPv4 client initiates a DNS query for A record (e.g.
   ipv6.example.com).

   2.  DNS receives the query.  As it is configured with the IPv6-
   converted address in advance, the A record will be returned to the
   IPv4 client.

   3.  IPv4 client sends IPv4 traffic with the returned IPv6-converted
   address as the destination address.

   4.  When the IPv4 traffic arrives at the NAT46, NAT46 extracts the
   destination address and destination port in the IPv4 traffic.  It
   will lookup the binding table maintained in NAT46 and NAT46
   translates the IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet according to [RFC6145].  No
   port translation will be performed here.

   5.  The return traffic is treated in the same way.


5.  Approach 2: Redirect-based Solution

   This approach is designed for HTTP application.  It will have a high
   address sharing ratio.  In HTTP, since the traffic can be redirected
   to a different service port, it is able to achieve address sharing
   for IPv6 servers by using different ports (denoted as IPv6-converted
   port).  Therefore, one IPv4 address can support up to thousands of
   IPv6 servers in theory.

   The overall solution is depicted in Figure 4.

   approach, except for the binding table includes IPv6 server address,
   IPv6 service port, IPv6-converted address and IPv6-converted port.

   2.  Redirect Server: A Redirect server is used to redirect traffic to
   a different IPv6-converted address and IPv6-converted port.  The
   redirect server may either store the binding table, or query for the
   redirected address and port from NAT46.

   of IPv4 client and the destination port).  The specific protocol for
   the request is now out of scope.

   5.  NAT46 selects IPv6-converted address and IPv6-converted port by
   lookuping the binding table.  It will also keep the destination port
   in the binding table.

   6.  NAT46 returns the IPv6-converted address and IPv6-converted port
   to redirect server and the redirect server in turn returns IPv6-
   converted address in HTTP redirect packet with HTTP error "302 not
   found".

   7.  IPv4 client replaces the destination IPv4 address with the
   returned IPv6-converted address.  The IPv4 traffic is routed to the
   NAT46.

   8. extracts the destination address and destination port in the IPv4
   traffic.  It will lookup the binding table maintained in NAT46 and
   NAT46 translates the IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet according to
   [RFC6145].


6.  IANA Considerations

   No requirement on IANA.
