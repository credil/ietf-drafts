            Problem Statement for Flow Control of MIF Hosts
                    draft-liu-mif-flow-control-ps-00

Abstract

   MIF hosts normally have multiple provisioning domains or interfaces.
   In some cases, the applications running on the MIF hosts need to
   select provisioning domain or interface based on either user
   preferences or network polices.  There is currently no standard ways
   for the MIF hosts to implement this kind of provisioning domain/
   interface selection.  This document discusses the problem statement
   of provisioning domain/interface control of the MIF hosts.

1.  Introduction

   The applications running on the MIF hosts normally do not have the
   knowledge of the multiple provisioning domain or multiple interfaces
   information.  But sometimes, the network connection of the
   applications running on the MIF hosts need to be controlled to switch
   from one network to another based on either operator polices or user
   preference.  For example, ANDSF (Access Network Discovery and
   Selection Function) that defined by 3GPP [TS.24.312] can push network
   selection policies to the terminal.  However, there is no standard
   and well defined interfaces for this kind of policy based flow
   control enforcement.  This will lead to the complexity and
   difficulties of the policy enforcement implementation.  This document
   discusses the problem statement of flow control of MIF host.

2.2.  Terminology

   ANDSF&#65306;Access Network Discovery and Selection Function.  This
   network entity is defined by 3GPP [TS.24.312].

   The terminology of this document comply to [RFC6418].

3.  Scenario and problem statement of flow control of the MIF hosts

   This section discusses the scenario of the flow control of MIF host.
   Then analysis the problems in this scenario.

3.1.  Scenario of flow control of MIF hosts

   One example of the MIF hosts flow control policy enforement is ANDSF
   based policy provisioning.  As figure 1 illustrated, the MIF host
   have both WLAN and celluar network connection.  ANDSF can push
   network selection policy to the MIF host.  There are three types of
   policies: 1.  Network discovery information.  For example, the
   location of WLAN network information or other access network
   information.  2.  Inter-system mobility policy (ISMP).  Those
   policies for the terminals with no more than one active access
   network connection.  3.  Inter-system routing policy (ISRP).  Those
   policies for the terminals that can have multiple network connections
   simultaneously.

   For the ISMP policies, the MIF host can rely on the connection
   manager to enforce the network selection policy.  For example, if the
   policy for the MIF host is to select WLAN network, the connection
   manager can control the terminal to switch on the WLAN interface and
   disconnect the celluar data connection.

   There are flow based policies defined by 3GPP ANDSF specification
   [TS.24.312].  An IP flow can be identified by source/destination IP
   address and port number.  For ISRP flow based policies, if the
   terminal and network support IFOM/MAPCON, the enforcement of flow
   based policy could be implemented by the mechanism provided by IFOM/
   MAPCON.  But for the non-seamless ISRP flow based policies, there is
   no standard and well defined interface for implementation.  This lead
   to the difficulties for the operators to deploy the ANDSF flow based
   policies.

   Another use case for flow based policy control is the user
   preference.  The users may want to set certain rules for a particular
   application's network usage.  For example, the user may want to set
   the online video app can only be used over WLAN network and the
   walled-garden application provided by the operator only be used over
   celluar network.  Without a standard and well defined interface, it
   is difficult to implement those policies.

3.2.  Problem analysis of flow based policies for MIF hosts

   As discussed in the above scenario, due to the lack of standard and
   well defined interface, it is difficult and with high complexity to
   implement the IP flow based policies.  There are different ways to
   cope with problem.  For example, similar to the idea of open flow, to
   define an extended forwarding table in the MIF host and allows the
   MIF host read forwarding policies from configuration.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security mechanism should be applied to ensure the flow based policy
   comes from a trusted entity.  Detailed security mechanism should be
   defined in the solution document.

5.  IANA Considerations
