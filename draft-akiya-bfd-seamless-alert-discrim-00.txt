1.  Introduction

   [RFC5880] defines the use of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
   protocol as a fast failure detection mechanism between nodes which
   are adjacent to each other or multiple hops away.  [RFC5881] defines
   single hop BFD.  Specifications such as [RFC5883] and [RFC5884]
   define multihop BFD.

   When multihop BFD, IP based or MPLS based, declares a failure,
   responsibility of identifying the problematic point in the paths is
   often left to operators.  ICMP echo request/reply (IP ping) [RFC0792]
   and LSP echo request/reply (LSP ping) [RFC4379] allow for tracing of
   hops to a specific target, and these are often used, manually or
   automatically, to attempt to isolate faults.  However, when it comes
   to identifying the problematic point that caused BFD failure, there
   are couple of issues.

   o  Usage of non-BFD packets can result in them being load balanced
      differently along the paths, causing those packets to traverse
      different paths than BFD packets to the target.

   o  BFD is designed with simplicity and low-overhead as goals.  Thus
      implementations often provide more preferable scale/performance
      capacities over IP/LSP ping, allowing for increased probability to
      identify short-lived transient issues.

   Above points produced the desire to use BFD to trace hops to a
   specific target.

   This specification defines a generic concept of alert discriminator
   which operates over Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (S-BFD) [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base].  New diagnostic codes, solely
   to be used together with alert discriminators, are also defined in
   this specification.  Finally, BFD path tracing is described as one of
   the use cases of defined mechanism.

   It is worth noting that this specification does not reserve specific
   BFD discriminator value as the alert discriminator, but only defines
   the concept of alert discriminators.

2.  Overview

   A group of network nodes reserves a same BFD discriminator value as
   the alert discriminator.  Alert discriminator operates as a BFD
   target identifier of alert type (3).  A reflector BFD session is then
   responsible for monitoring incoming BFD control packets with alert
   discriminator as "your discriminator".  Reflector BFD session, upon
   reception of BFD control packets with alert discriminator as "your
   discriminator", would examine BFD diagnostic code.  Diagnostic code
   instructs how reflector BFD session is to behave.  A network node is
   able to transmit S-BFD control packets with "your discriminator" as
   this alert discriminator and well known diagnostic code, to a
   particular target, and expect reflector BFD session on the target
   network node to behave accordingly.

3.  Alert Discriminator

   Alert discriminator is a BFD target identifier of type (3).

    Value    BFD Target Identifier Type
   ------    --------------------------
        3    Alert Discriminator

Internet-Draft      S-BFD Alert Discrim & Path Trace           July 2013


   Uniqueness of alert discriminator is that same BFD discriminator
   value is reserved on group of network nodes as the alert
   discriminator.

   For example, there are 4 network nodes in a network: A, B, C, D.
   0x7F7F7F7F is chosen as the alert discriminator for this network.
   Nodes A, B, C and D will each reserve 0x7F7F7F7F as BFD target
   identifier type 3.

   How alert discriminator value is to be chosen is outside the scope of
   this document.

4.  Reflector BFD Session

   One or more reflector BFD session(s) MUST be created on each network
   node which has reserved alert discriminator(s).  Reflector BFD
   session MUST listen for incoming S-BFD control packets with "your
   discriminator" of BFD target identifier type 3, alert discriminators.
   Further procedures for a reflector BFD session processing incoming
   S-BFD control packets for BFD target identifier type 3 depends on
   specified BFD diagnostic code.  Definition of BFD diagnostic code for
   alert discriminator usage and required reflector BFD session behavior
   for each are described in Section 5.

5.  Alert Discriminator Diagnostic Code

   [RFC5880] defines a field to describe diagnostic code in a BFD
   control packet, and defines set of diagnostic codes.  This
   specification defines a new set of diagnostic codes to be used solely
   for S-BFD control packets using alert discriminators.  New diagnostic
   codes specified in this document are only meaningful when used
   together with alert discriminators.

   o  S-BFD control packets transmitted and received, destined for BFD
      target identifier of type 3, MUST NOT use diagnostic codes defined
      in [RFC5880] and MUST use diagnostic codes defined in this
      document.

   o  [S-]BFD control packets transmitted and received, not destined for
      BFD target identifier of type 3, MUST use diagnostic codes defined
      in [RFC5880] and MUST NOT use diagnostic codes defined in this
      document.

   Note that BFD diagnostic codes for alert discriminators are defined
   from highest possible values.  Any future documents claiming alert
   discriminator diagnostic codes MUST use next available highest values
   from the reserved range.  Alert discriminator diagnostic codes are
   defined as follow:

Internet-Draft      S-BFD Alert Discrim & Path Trace           July 2013


    Value    Alert Discriminator Diagnostic Code Name
   ------    ----------------------------------------
     0-30    Reserved for future use
       31    BFD path trace


   When transmitted BFD control packet is targeted to a BFD target
   identifier of type 3, then BFD diagnostic code MUST NOT be zero.
   When receiving BFD control packet is targeted to a BFD target
   identifier of type 3, then packet with BFD diagnostic code of zero
   MUST be dropped.

   Note that primary purpose of alert discriminator diagnostic codes are
   to provide hints to responder on why initiator is sending alert
   discriminator S-BFD packets.

6.  BFD Path Trace: Alert Discriminator Diagnostic Code 31

   BFD path trace, aka BFD traceroute, is performed through making use
   of the alert discriminator with alert discriminator diagnostic code
   31.

6.1.  Initiator Procedures

   When a network node desires to trace hops to a BFD target, S-BFD
   control packets are transmitted with following contents.

6.1.1.  Transmission S-BFD Control Packets

   o  IP destination address or MPLS label stack MUST be set to describe
      the target.

   o  "your discriminator" MUST be set to an alert discriminator.

   o  BFD diagnostic code MUST be set to 31 (BFD path trace).

   o  Poll (P) bit MUST be set.

   o  Incrementing or decrementing IP/MPLS TTL.

   o  Remaining packet contents are as per described in
      [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-ip].

   When incrementing TTL is used towards the BFD target, TTL SHOULD
   start at value of 1.  Completion of BFD path trace is reached when
   locally determined so (ex: no response from one of the nodes) or when
   one of following conditions are hit, and initiator MUST NOT transmit
   BFD path trace packets to further downstream network nodes:



Akiya, et al.           Expires January 05, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      S-BFD Alert Discrim & Path Trace           July 2013


   o  Response S-BFD control packet has been received from intended BFD
      target.

   o  In case IP address(es) of intended BFD target is unknown, two
      consecutive response S-BFD control packets (TTL+n and TTL+(n+1))
      contain same IP source address.

   When decrementing TTL is used, BFD path trace SHOULD start from the
   BFD target using TTL=N. How value of N is determined is outside the
   scope of this document.  Completion of BFD path trace is reached when
   locally determined so or after performing BFD path trace operation to
   TTL=1.

   Because there are no sequence numbers included in transmitted and
   received S-BFD control packets (without use of Authentication) for
   BFD path tracing, initiator SHOULD allow some delay between multiple
   BFD path tracing operations for a same target, if same "my
   discriminator" value is used on them.  This is to ensure responses
   from multiple BFD path tracing operations do not conflict with each
   other, resulting in incorrectly recorded hops.

6.1.2.  Reception of S-BFD Control Packets

   If response S-BFD control packets do not contain "my discriminator"
   of alert discriminator, then packet MUST NOT be considered as
   response for BFD path tracing.

   If response S-BFD control packets do not have Final (F) bit set, then
   packet MUST NOT be considered as response for BFD path tracing.

   If response S-BFD control packets do not contain BFD diagnostic code
   31, then packet MUST NOT be considered as response for BFD path
   tracing.

   IP source address of valid response S-BFD control packets are
   recorded to form trace hops to the BFD target.

6.2.  Responder Procedures

   Reflector BFD session at the responder network node MUST operate with
   procedures described in [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-ip].

6.2.1.  Reception of S-BFD Control Packets

   Following conditions MUST be met for received S-BFD control packets
   targeted to BFD target identifier of type 3 to be considered for BFD
   path tracing:




Akiya, et al.           Expires January 05, 2014                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      S-BFD Alert Discrim & Path Trace           July 2013


   o  BFD diagnostic code is 31 (BFD path trace).

   o  Poll (P) bit is set.

6.2.2.  Transmission of S-BFD Control Packets

   Following procedures MUST be followed when transmitting a response
   S-BFD control packet for BFD path tracing:

   o  BFD diagnostic code in response S-BFD packet MUST be set to 31
      (BFD path trace).

   o  Final (F) bit MUST be set.

6.3.  Possible Use Cases

   BFD path tracing may be desirable for following occasions.

   o  When a BFD session is determined to have lost reachability to the
      target (ex: state transitions from UP to DOWN), immediately
      trigger BFD path trace to the target to attempt to isolate the
      fault.

   o  While a particular BFD session is in UP state, occasionally
      trigger BFD path trace in the background to record the paths.
      Compare recorded paths to see how frequently paths are changing.
      If determined to be more frequent than expected, then log a
      warning to indicate potential network instability.

   o  Just trigger BFD path trace, manually or automatically, as needed
      basis.

7.  Security Considerations

   Alert discriminator selected for a network should be kept from being
   disclosed to anybody or anything external to the network.  This will
   prevent attacks from knowing the exact value for the alert
   discriminator.  It is still possible for attacks to scan a range of
   BFD discriminator values to identify alert discriminator being used.
   Therefore, as described in [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base],
   implementations MUST provide filtering capability based on source IP
   addresses.

   In addition, same security considerations as [RFC5880], [RFC5881],
   [RFC5883], [RFC5884], [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] and
   [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-ip] apply to this document.
