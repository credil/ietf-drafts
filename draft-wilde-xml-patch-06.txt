                 A Media Type for XML Patch Operations
                        draft-wilde-xml-patch-06

Abstract

   The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch+xml" defines an XML
   document structure for expressing a sequence of patch operations that
   are applied to an XML document.  The XML Patch document format's
   foundations are defined in RFC 5261, this specification defines a
   document format and a media type registration, so that XML Patch
   documents can be labeled with a media type, for example in HTTP
   conversations.

   In addition to the media type registration, this specification also
   updates RFC 5261 in some aspects, limiting these updates to cases
   where RFC 5261 needed to be fixed, or was hard to understand.

Internet-Draft                  XML Patch                   October 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) [RFC3023] is a common format for
   the exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789]
   extends HTTP [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial modifications
   to resources.  HTTP PATCH requires that patch documents be sent along
   with the request, and it is therefore useful for there to be
   standardized patch document formats (identified by media types) for
   popular media types.

   The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch+xml" is an XML
   document structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply
   to a target XML document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH
   method.  Servers can freely choose which patch formats they want to
   accept, and "application/xml-patch+xml" could be a simple default
   format that can be used unless a server decides to use a different
   (maybe more sophisticated) patch format for XML.

   The format for patch documents is based on the XML Patch Framework
   defined in RFC 5261 [RFC5261].  While RFC 5261 does define a concrete
   syntax as well as the media type "application/patch-ops-error+xml"
   for error documents, it only defines XML Schema (XSD)
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] types for patch operations.  The
   concrete document format and the media type for patch operations are
   defined in an XSD defined in this specification.

   This specification updates sections of RFC 5261 that need to be
   fixed, or are hard to understand.  The updates are listed in
   Section 2, and all references to RFC 5261 made in this specification
   should be read as referring to the updated version.  The main reason
   for the changes are the problematic ways in which RFC 5261 relies on
   XPath as the expression language for selecting the location of a
   patch, while at the same time XPath's data model does not contain
   sufficient information to determine whether such a selector indeed
   can be used for a patch operation, or should result in an error.
   Specifically, the problem occurs with namespaces, where XPath does
   not expose namespace declaration attributes, while the patch model
   needs them to determine whether a namespace patch is allowed or not.
   Appendix A contains more information about the general problem, and
   Section 2 lists the resulting updates to RFC 5261 to make the model
   well-defined and the text easier to read and understand.


2.  Updates to RFC 5261

   This section is normative.  It contains a list of updates to RFC 5261
   [RFC5261].  These updates are limited to cases where RFC 5261 needed
   to be fixed, or was hard to understand.

2.1.  Section 4.2.2

   Section 4.2.2 of RFC 5261 [RFC5261] says:

      In XPath 2.0, a "bar" selector not only matches an unqualified
      <bar> element, but also matches a qualified <bar> element that is
      in scope of a default namespace declaration.  In contrast, in this
      specification, a selector without a prefix only matches one
      element, and it may match an element with or without a prefix but
      only if the namespace it's qualified with (or none) is an exact
      match.

   It should say:

      In XPath 2.0, a "bar" selector matches elements that have the URI
      of the "default element/type namespace", which is part of an
      XPath's static context.  By setting this URI to the default
      namespace of the diff document (or leave it empty, if there is
      none), XPath 2.0's behavior matches the requirements of the
      previous section.

   Explanation: The original text is not easy to understand, but seems
   to assume that an unprefixed name in XPath 2.0 matches both
   unprefixed names, and prefixed ones that have the same namespace as
   the default namespace of the XPath static context.  This is not the
   case: Matching depends on how the "default element/type namespace" of
   the XPath static context is defined, and then matches either
   namespace-less elements, or those in the "default element/type
   namespace", but never both.  This context, however, is defined by the
   XPath itself, not by the document.  Thus, it can be set externally
   and could be set to the diff document's default namespace (if there
   is one).  In that case, XPath 2.0 can be used to evaluate XML Patch
   selectors.

2.2.  Section 4.4.3

   Section 4.4.3 of RFC 5261 [RFC5261] says:

      4.4.3.  Replacing a Namespace Declaration URI

      An example for a replacement of a namespace URI: <replace
      sel="doc/namespace::pref">urn:new:xxx</replace> This will replace
      the URI value of 'pref' prefixed namespace node with
      "urn:new:xxx".  The parent node of the namespace declaration MUST
      be the <doc> element, otherwise an error occurs.

   It should say:

      4.4.3.  Replacing a Namespace URI

      An example for a replacement of a namespace URI: <replace
      sel="doc/namespace::pref">urn:new:xxx</replace> This will replace
      the URI of the namespace associated with the 'pref' prefix with
      "urn:new:xxx".  The parent node of the namespace declaration MUST
      be the <doc> element, otherwise an error occurs.  Replacing the
      namespace at the element where it is declared MUST also change all
      namespace nodes derived from this declaration in descendant
      elements.

   Explanation: The specification uses the terms "namespace declaration"
   and "namespace" almost interchangeably, which is incorrect.  It is
   impossible to select namespace declarations using XPath.  When
   selecting and replacing a namespace, then it should be taken into
   account that its associated namespace declaration very likely has
   resulted in numerous namespace nodes, attached to descendant elements
   of the element where the namespace was declared.  It is likely that
   RFC 5261 intended to specify a "recursive replace" of the resulting
   namespace nodes of a namespace declaration, and this is what the
   corrected text suggests.  The original text is mixing terminology,
   hard to read, and ambiguous in its meaning.

   Side note: If the original text had indeed tried to specify that only
   this one namespace node should be changed, then this could lead to
   rather strange effects in the resulting document, since 1) the XPath
   tree would now have "orphan" namespace nodes, which 2) then would
   need to be serialized, and 3) there would be resulting namespace
   declarations in locations where previously no namespace declarations
   occurred.

2.3.  Section 8

   Section 8 of RFC 5261 [RFC5261] says:

      <!ENTITY id "id\(('&ncname;')?\)|id\((&quot;&ncname;&quot;)?\)">

   It should say:

      <!ENTITY id "id\('&ncname;'\)|id\(&quot;&ncname;&quot;\)">

   Explanation: The regex in the XSD suggests that "id()" would be a
   valid selector for a patch, but it would not make sense to specify
   such a selector, since it never would select a node (there is no
   identifier to locate in the document).  This means that while "id()"
   is a valid XPath expression, it should not be allowed as a selector
   expression within an XML patch document.

2.4.  XSD for RFC 5261

   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] defining the add, replace, and remove
   types in RFC 5261 [RFC5261].  The modification is based on the
   grammar change made in Section 2.3.

2.5.  ABNF for RFC 5261

   RFC 5261 [RFC5261] does not contain an ABNF grammar for the allowed
   subset of XPath expressions, but includes an XSD-based grammar in its
   type definition for operation types (which is shown in Section 2.4).
   In order to make implementation easier, this appendix contains an
   ABNF grammar that has been derived from the XSD expressions given in
   Section 2.4.  In the following grammar, "xpath" is the definition for
   the allowed XPath expressions for remove and replace operations, and
   "xpath-add" is the definition for the allowed XPath expressions for
   add operations.  The names of all grammar productions are the ones
   used in the XSD-based grammar of RFC 5261.
   anychar    =  %x00-ffffffff
                  ncname     =  1*%x00-ffffffff
                  qname      =  [ ncname ":" ] ncname
                  aname      =  "@" qname
                  pos        =  "[" 1*DIGIT "]"
                  attr       =  ( "[" aname "='" 0*anychar "']" ) /
                  ( "[" aname "=" DQUOTE 0*anychar DQUOTE "]" )
                  valueq     =  "[" ( qname / "." ) "=" DQUOTE 0*anychar DQUOTE "]"
                  value      =  ( "[" ( qname / "." ) "='" 0*anychar "']" ) / valueq

                  id         =  ( "id(" [ "'" ncname "'" ] ")" ) /
                  ( "id(" [ DQUOTE ncname DQUOTE ] ")" )

                  nspa       =  "namespace::" ncname
                  cnodes     =  ( text / com / pi ) [ pos ]
                  child      =  cnodes / step
                  last       =  child / aname / nspa
                  xpath      =  [ "/" ] ( ( id [ 0*( "/" step ) "/" last ] ) /
                  ( 0*( step "/" ) last ) )
                  xpath-add  =  [ "/" ] ( ( id [ 0*( "/" step ) "/" child ] ) /
                  ( 0*( step "/" ) child ) )


3.  Patch Documents

3.1.  Patch Document Format

   The XML patch document format is based on a simple schema that uses a
   "patch" element as the document element, and allows an arbitrary
   sequence of "add", "remove", and "replace" elements as the children

   of the document element.  These children follow the semantics defined
   in RFC 5261, which means that each element is treated as an
   individual patch operation, and the result of each patch operation is
   a patched XML document that is the target XML document for the next
   patch operation.

   The following example patch document uses the example from RFC 5261
   section A.18; it uses a "patch" element and a new XML namespace.  It
   shows the general structure of an XML patch document, as well as an
   example of each operation.

      <p:patch xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xxx"
               xmlns:y="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yyy"
               xmlns:p="urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX">
          <p:add sel="doc/elem[@a='foo']">
              <!-- This is a new child -->
              <child id="ert4773">
                  <y:node/>
              </child>
          </p:add>
          <p:replace sel="doc/note/text()">Patched doc</p:replace>
          <p:remove sel="*/elem[@a='bar']/y:child" ws="both"/>
          <p:add sel="*/elem[@a='bar']" type="@b">new attr</p:add>
      </p:patch>

   As this example demonstrates, both the document element "patch" and
   the patch operation elements are in the same XML namespace.  This is
   the result of RFC 5261 only defining types for the patch operation
   elements, which then can be reused in schemas to define concrete
   patch elements.

   RFC 5261 defines an XML Schema (XSD) [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028]
   for the patch operation types, which is shown in Section 2.4.  The
   following schema for the XML Patch media type is based on the types
   defined in RFC 5261, which are imported as "rfc5261.xsd" in the
   following schema.  The schema defines a "patch" document element, and
   then allows an unlimited (and possibly empty) sequence of the "add",
   "remove", and "replace" operation elements, which are directly based
   on the respective types from the schema defined in RFC 5261.

3.2.  Patch Examples

   Since the semantics of the XML patch operations are defined by RFC
   5261, please refer to the numerous examples in that specification for
   concrete XML patch document examples.  Most importantly, the examples
   in RFC 5261 can be taken literally as examples for the XML Patch
   media type, as long as it is assumed that the XML namespace for the
   operation elements in these examples is the URI "urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX".


4.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet media type [RFC6838] for an XML Patch Document is
   application/xml-patch+xml.

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: xml-patch+xml

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters:

         charset: Same as charset parameter for the media type
         "application/xml" as specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      Encoding considerations: Same as encoding considerations of media
      type "application/xml" as specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      Security considerations: This media type has all of the security
      considerations described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023] and RFC 5261
      [RFC5261], plus those listed in Section 5.

5.  Security Considerations

   Parsing XML may entail including information from external sources
   through XML's mechanism of external entities.  Implementations
   therefore should be aware of the fact that standard parsers may
   resolve external entities, and thus include external information as a
   result of applying patch operations to an XML document.


6.  Open Issues

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   o  "ncname" in the XSD grammar is defined as "\i\c*", but so far has
      been translated into "1*%x00-ffffffff" in the ABNF grammar.
      Ideally, the grammar should reflect how XSD defines these multi-
      character escapes, but they map into rather complicated character
      ranges in XML itself (such as
      http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Letter).

Internet-Draft                  XML Patch                   October 2013


Appendix A.  Implementation Hints

   This section is informative.  It described some issues that might be
   interesting for implementers, but it might also be interesting for
   users of XML Patch that want to understand some of the differences
   between standard XPath 1.0 processing, and the processing model of
   selectors in RFC 5261.

A.1.  Matching Namespaces

   RFC 5261 defines standard rules for matching prefixed names in
   expressions: Any prefixes are interpreted according to the namespace
   bindings of the diff document (the document that the expression is
   applied against).  This means that each prefixed name can be
   interpreted in the context of the diff document.

   For unprefixed names in expressions, the rules depart from XPath 1.0
   [W3C.REC-xpath-19991116].  XPath 1.0 defines that unprefixed names in
   expressions match namespace-less names (i.e., there is no "default
   namespace" for names used in XPath 1.0 expressions).  RFC 5261
   requires, however, that unprefixed names in expressions must use the
   default namespace of the diff document (if there is one).  This means
   that it is not possible to simply take a selector from a patch
   document and evaluate it in the context of the diff document
   according to the rules of XPath 1.0, because this would interpret
   unprefixed names incorrectly.  As a consequence, it is not possible
   to simply take an XPath 1.0 processor and evaluate XMPL Patch
   selectors in the context of the diff document.

   As an extension of XPath 1.0's simple model, XPath 2.0
   [W3C.REC-xpath20-20101214] specifies different processing rules for
   unprefixed names: They are matched against the URI of the "default
   element/type namespace", which is defined as part of an expression's
   static context.  In some XPath 2.0 applications, this can be set;
   XSLT 2.0 for example has the ability to define an "xpath-default-
   namespace", which then will be used to match unprefixed names in
   expressions.  Thus, by using an XPath 2.0 implementation that allows
   to set this URI, and setting it to the default namespace of the diff
   document (or leaving it undefined if there is no such default
   namespace), it is possible to use an out-of-the-box XPath 2.0
   implementation for evaluating XML Patch selectors.

   Please keep in mind, however, that evaluating selectors is only one
   part of applying patches.  When it comes to applying the actual patch
   operation, neither XPath 1.0 nor XPath 2.0 are sufficient because
   they do not preserve some of the information from the XML syntax
   (specifically: namespace declarations) that is required to correctly
   apply patch operations.  The following section describes this issue

Internet-Draft                  XML Patch                   October 2013


   in more detail.

   Please note that RFC 5261's Section 4.2.2 on namespace matching
   explains XPath 2.0's rules incorrectly
   <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261#section-4.2.2>.  For this reason,
   Section 2.1 updates Section 4.2.2 of RFC 5261.

A.2.  Patching Namespaces

   One of the issues when patching namespaces based on XPath is that
   XPath exposes namespaces differently than the XML 1.0
   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] syntax for XML Namespaces
   [W3C.REC-xml-names-20091208].  In the XML syntax, a namespace is
   declared with an attribute using the reserved name or prefix "xmlns",
   and this results in this namespace being available recursively
   through the document tree.  In XPath, the namespace declaration is
   not exposed as an attribute (i.e., the attribute, although
   syntactically an XML attribute, is not accessible in XPath), but the
   resulting namespace nodes are exposed recursively through the tree.

   RFC 5261 uses the terms "namespace declaration" and "namespace"
   almost interchangeably, but it is important to keep in mind that the
   namespace declaration is an XML syntax construct that is unavailable
   in XPath, while the namespace itself is a logical construct that is
   not visible in the XML syntax, but a result of a namespace
   declaration.  The intent of RFC 5261 is to patch namespaces as if
   namespace declarations were patched, and thus it only allows patching
   namespace nodes on the element nodes where the namespace has been
   declared.

   Patching namespaces in XML Patch is supposed to "emulate" the effect
   of actually changing the namespace declaration (which is why a
   namespace can only be patched at the element where it has been
   declared).  Therefore, when patching a namespace, even though XPath's
   "namespace" axis is used, implementations have to make sure that not
   only the single selected namespace node is being patched, but that
   all namespaces nodes resulting from the namespace declaration of this
   namespace are also patched accordingly.

   This means that an implementation might have to descend into the
   tree, matching all namespace nodes with the selected prefix/URI pair
   recursively, until it encounters leaf elements or namespace
   declarations with the same prefix it is patching.  Determining this
   requires access to the diff document beyond XPath, because in XPath
   itself namespace declarations are not represented, and thus such a
   recursive algorithm wouldn't know when to stop.  Consider the
   following document:




Wilde                    Expires April 11, 2014                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                  XML Patch                   October 2013


   <x xmlns:a="tag:42">
       <y xmlns:a="tag:42"/>
   </x>

   If this document is patched with a selector of /x/namespace::a, then
   only the namespace node on element x should be patched, even though
   the namespace node on element y has the same prefix/URI combination
   as the one on element x.  However, determining that the repeated
   namespace declaration was present at all on element y is impossible
   when using XPath alone, which means that implementations must have an
   alternative way to determine the difference between the document
   above, and this one:
   <x xmlns:a="tag:42">
       <y/>
   </x>

   In this second example, patching with a selector of /x/namespace::a
   should indeed change the namespace nodes on elements x and y, because
   they both have been derived from the same namespace declaration.

   The conclusion of these considerations is that for implementing XML
   Patch, access closer to the XML syntax (specifically: access to
   namespace declarations) is necessary.  As a result, implementations
   attempting to exclusively use the XPath model for implementing XML
   Patch will fail to correctly address certain edge cases (such as the
   one shown above).

   Note that XPath's specific limitations do not mean that it is
   impossible to use XML technologies other than XPath.  The Document
   Object Model (DOM) [W3C.REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407], for example,
   does expose namespace declaration attributes as regular attributes in
   the document tree, and thus could be used to differentiate between
   the two variants shown above.

   Please note that RFC 5261's Section 4.4.3 on replacing namespaces
   mixes the terms "namespace declaration" and "namespace".  For this
   reason, Section 2.2 updates Section 4.4.3 of RFC 5261.


Appendix B.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 6982
   [RFC6982].  The description of implementations in this section is
   intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing

   drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
   implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
   Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
   presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
   intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
   implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
   other implementations may exist.

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

      EMC: EMC's IIG unit has implemented the selector part of the
      specification, which is the trickiest part (see Appendix A.1 for
      an explanation).  By reusing an existing XPath 1.0 implementation
      and changing it to match the changed default namespace processing
      model, the required behavior is fairly easy to implement.  This
      does, however, require that the implementation is available in
      source code, and also does require some changes to the
      implementation's code.  The resulting implementation is closed
      source and will be made available, if released, as part of EMC's
      XML database product xDB
      <http://www.emc.com/products/detail/software2/documentum-xdb.htm>.
