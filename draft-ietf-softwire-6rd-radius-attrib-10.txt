Abstract 

   IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) provides both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity 
   services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existence period. The 
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 6rd option has been 
   defined to configure the 6rd Customer Edge (CE). However, in many 
   networks, the configuration information may be stored in 
   Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers while user 
   configuration is mainly acquired from a Broadband Network Gateway 
   (BNG) through the DHCP protocol. This document defines a Remote 
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries 
   6rd configuration information from the AAA server to BNGs.

1. Introduction 

   Recently providers have started to deploy IPv6 and to consider 
   transition to IPv6. IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) [RFC5969] provides 
   both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the 
   IPv4/IPv6 co-existence period. 6rd is used to provide IPv6 
   connectivity service through legacy IPv4-only infrastructure. 6rd 
   uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131] and the 6rd 
   Customer Edge (CE) uses the DHCP 6rd option [RFC5969] to discover a 
   6rd border relay and to configure IPv6 prefix and address. 

   In many networks, user configuration information is managed by AAA 
   (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) servers. The Remote 
   Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol [RFC2865] is 
   usually used by AAA servers to communicate with network elements. In 
   a fixed line broadband network, the Broadband Network Gateways (BNGs) 
   act as the access gateway for users. The BNGs are assumed to embed a 
   DHCP server function that allows them to handle locally any DHCP 
   requests issued by hosts. 

   Since the 6rd configuration information is stored in AAA servers and 
   user configuration is mainly through DHCP between BNGs and hosts/CEs, 
   new RADIUS attributes are needed to propagate the information from 
   AAA servers to BNGs. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

   The terms 6rd Customer Edge (6rd CE) and 6rd Border Relay (BR) are 
   defined in [RFC5969]. 

3. IPv6 6rd Configuration with RADIUS 

   Figure 1 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCP cooperate to 
   provide 6rd CE with 6rd configuration information.

             Figure 1: the cooperation between DHCP and RADIUS 
                       combining with RADIUS authentication 

   The BNG acts as a client of RADIUS and as a DHCP server. First, the 
   6rd CE initiates a DHCPDISCOVER message that includes a Parameter 
   Request option (55) [RFC2132] with the 6rd option [RFC5969]. When the 
   BNG receives the DHCPDISCOVER, it initiates a RADIUS Access-Request 
   message, in which the User-Name attribute is filled by the 6rd CE MAC 
   address, to the RADIUS server and the User-password attribute is 
   filled by the shared 6rd password that has been preconfigured on the 
   DHCP server, requesting authentication as defined in [RFC2865] with 
   IPv6-6rd-Configuration attribute, defined in the next Section, in the 
   desired attribute list. If the authentication request is approved by 
   the AAA server, an Access-Accept message is acknowledged with the 
   IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute. Then, the BNG responds to the 6rd 
   CE with a DHCPOFFER message, which contains a DHCP 6rd option. The 
   recommended format of the MAC address is as defined in Calling-
   Station-Id ([RFC3580] Section 3.20) without the SSID (Service Set 
   Identifier) portion. 

   Figure 2 describes another scenario - later re-authorize - in which 
   the authorization operation is not coupled with authentication. 
   Authorization relevant to 6rd is done independently after the 
   authentication process.

                   DHCP                         RADIUS 
              Figure 2: the cooperation between DHCP and RADIUS 
                        decoupled with RADIUS authentication 

   In this scenario, the Access-Request packet contains a Service-Type 
   attribute with the value Authorize Only (17); thus, according to 
   [RFC5080], the Access-Request packet MUST contain a State attribute 
   that obtains from the previous authentication process. 

    

   In both above-mentioned scenarios, Message-authenticator (type 80) 
   [RFC2865] SHOULD be used to protect both Access-Request and Access-
   Accept messages. 

   After receiving the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in the initial 
   Access-Accept, the BNG MUST store the received 6rd configuration 
   parameters locally. When the 6rd CE sends a DHCP Request message to 
   request an extension of the lifetime for the assigned address, the 
   BNG does not have to initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA 
   server to request the 6rd configuration parameters. The BNG retrieves 
   the previously stored 6rd configuration parameters and uses them in 
   its reply. 

   If the BNG does not receive the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in 
   the Access-Accept it MAY fall back to a pre-configured default 6rd 
   configuration, if any. If the BNG does not have any pre-configured 
   default 6rd configuration or if the BNG receives an Access-Reject, 
   the tunnel cannot be established. 

   As specified in [RFC2131], section 4.4.5, "Reacquisition and 
   expiration", if the DHCP server to which the DHCP Request message was 
   sent at time T1 has not responded by time T2 (typically 
   0.375*duration_of_lease after T1), the 6rd CE (the DHCP client) 
   enters the REBINDING state and attempts to contact any server.  In 
   this situation, the secondary BNG receiving the new DHCP message MUST 
   initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA server. The secondary 
   BNG MAY include the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in its Access-
   Request. 

4. Attributes 

   This section defines IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute which is used 
   in the both abovementioned scenarios. The attribute design follows 
   [RFC6158] and referring to [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions].

4.1. IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute 

   The specification requires that multiple IPv4 addresses are 
   associated with one IPv6 prefix. Given that RADIUS currently has no 
   recommended way of grouping multiple attributes, the design below 
   appears to be a reasonable compromise. The IPv6-6rd-Configuration 
   Attribute is structured as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

       IPv4MaskLen 

         The number of high-order bits that are identical across all CE 
         IPv4 addresses within a given 6rd domain. This may be any value 
         between 0 and 32. Any value greater than 32 is invalid. Since 
         [RFC6158] Section A.2.1 has forbidden 8-bit fields, a 32-bit 
         field is used here.

         Set to be all 0 for now. Reserved for future use. To be 
         compatible with other IPv6 prefix attributes in the RADIUS 
         Protocol. The bits MUST be set to zero by the sender and MUST 
         be ignored by the receiver. 

       6rdPrefixLen 

         The IPv6 Prefix length of the Service Provider's 6rd IPv6 
         prefix in number of bits. The 6rdPrefixLen MUST be less than or 
         equal to 128. 

       6rdPrefix 

         The Service Provider's 6rd IPv6 prefix represented as a 16 
         octet IPv6 address. The bits after the 6rdPrefixlen number of 
         bits in the prefix SHOULD be set to zero.

         One or more IPv4 addresses of the 6rd Border Relay(s) for a 
         given 6rd domain. The maximum RADIUS Attribute length of 255 
         octets results in a limit of 37 IPv4 addresses. 

   Since the subtypes have values, they can appear in any order. If 
   multiple 6rdBRIPv4Address (subtype 3) appear, they are RECOMMENDED to 
   be placed together. 

   The IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute is normally used in the  
   Access-Accept messages. It MAY be used in Access-Request packets as a 
   hint to the RADIUS server; for example if the BNG is pre-configured 
   with a default 6rd configuration, these parameters MAY be inserted in 
   the attribute. The RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint sent by the BNG 
   and it MAY assign different 6rd parameters. 

   If the BNG includes the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute, but the AAA 
   server does not recognize it, this attribute MUST be ignored by the 
   AAA Server. 

   If the BNG does not receive the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in 
   the Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default 6rd 
   configuration, if any. If the BNG does not have any pre-configured 
   default 6rd configuration, the 6rd tunnel cannot be established. 

   If the BNG is pre-provisioned with a default 6rd configuration and 
   the 6rd configuration received in Access-Accept is different from the 
   configured default, then the 6rd configuration received in the 
   Access-Accept message MUST be used for the session. 

   If the BNG cannot support the received 6rd configuration for any 
   reason, the tunnel SHOULD NOT be established. 

4.2. Table of attributes 

   The following table adds to the one in [RFC2865], Section 5.44, 
   providing a guide to the quantity of IPv6-6rd-Configuration 
   attributes that may be found in each kind of packet.

         packet. 
   1     Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in

5. Diameter Considerations 

   This attribute is usable within either RADIUS or Diameter [RFC6733]. 
   Since the Attributes defined in this document will be allocated from 
   the standard RADIUS type space, no special handling is required by 
   Diameter entities. 

6. Security Considerations 

   In 6rd scenarios, both CE and BNG are within a provider network, 
   which can be considered as a closed network and a lower security 
   threat environment. A similar consideration can be applied to the 
   RADIUS message exchange between BNG and the AAA server. 

   In 6rd scenarios, the RADIUS protocol is run over IPv4. Known 
   security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol are discussed in 
   [RFC2607], [RFC2865], and [RFC2869]. Use of IPsec [RFC4301] for 
   providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 is discussed in 
   [RFC3162]. 

   A malicious user may use MAC address proofing and/or dictionary 
   attack on the shared 6rd password that has been preconfigured on the 
   DHCP server to get unauthorized 6rd configuration information. The 
   follow-up secure issues have been considered in Section 12,  
   [RFC5969]. 

   Security considerations for 6rd specific between 6rd CE and BNG are 
   discussed in [RFC5969]. Furthermore, generic DHCP security mechanisms 
   can be applied DHCP intercommunication between 6rd CE and BNG. 

   The MAC address spoofing is possible 

   Security considerations for the Diameter protocol are discussed in 
   [RFC6733]. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document requests the assignment of one new RADIUS Attribute 
   Types in the "RADIUS Types" registry (currently located at 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following 
   attributes:

      o  IPv6-6rd-Configuration 

   IANA should allocate the number from the standard RADIUS Attributes 
   range (values 1-191).  The RFC Editor should use the assigned value 
   to replace "TBD" in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, and should remove this 
   paragraph.
