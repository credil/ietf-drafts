      <t>
        Preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("precis")
        framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/> is defining
        several classes of strings for preparation and comparison.  In the
        document, case mapping is defined because many of protocols handle 
        case sensitive or case insensitive string comparison and therefore
        preparation of string is mandatory.  As described in IDNA mapping 
        <xref target="RFC5895"/> and precis problem statement 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement"/>, mappings in 
        internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width, 
        delimiters and/or other specials are taken into consideration.
        This document is a guideline for authors of protocol profiles of precis framework
        and describes the mappings, that may be performed before precis framework,
        that must be considered between receiving user input and passing
        permitted code points to internationalized protocols.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In many cases, user input of internationalized strings is generated
        by input method editor ("IME") or copy-and-paste from free text.
        Usually users do not care case and/or width of input characters
        because they are identical for users' eyes.  Further, users rarely
        switch IME state to input special characters such as protocol
        elements.  For Internationalized Domain Names ("IDNs"), IDNA Mapping
        <xref target="RFC5895"/> describes methods to treat these issues. 
        For precis strings, case mapping is defined as a process in precis
        framework <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/>, but width
        mapping, delimiter mapping, special mapping and language dependent mapping are not defined.
        Handling of mappings other than case is also important to increase chance of
        strings match as users expect.
        This document is a guideline for authors of protocol profiles of precis framework
        and describes the mappings that must be considered
        between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to
        internationalized protocols.
        Mappings that this document describes are expected to perform before precis framework as well as Mapping Characters for IDNA2008
        <xref target="RFC5895"/>.

    <section title="Types of mapping" anchor="type">
      <t>
        This document defines two types of mapping. One is protocol independent mapping
        that doesn't depend on protocol rules and the other is protocol dependent mapping that depend on protocol rules.
        This document defines some mappings in these mapping types. 
        Authors of protocol profiles of precis framework should need to give careful consideration to choice of mappings.
      </t>
      <t>
        Each mapping type is described in following sections.
      </t>
    </section>
<!-- ******************************************************************************* -->
    <section title="Protocol independent mapping" anchor="pim">
      <t>
        Protocol independent mapping is a mapping that doesn't depend on protocol rules.
      </t>
      <section title="Width mapping">
        <t>
          Fullwidth and halfwidth characters (those defined with
          Decomposition Types &lt;wide&gt; and &lt;narrow&gt;) are mapped to
          their decomposition mappings as shown in the Unicode character
          database <xref target="Unicode"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Width mapping will increase backward compatibility with Stringprep
          <xref target="RFC3454"/> and precis framework 
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/>.  Because in a
          Stringprep profile which specifies Unicode normalization form KC
          (NFKC) for normalization method, fullwidth/halfwidth characters
          are mapped into its compatible form.  If a precis framework
          profile specified NFKC (which is not recommended), width mapping
          might not be useful.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
<!-- ******************************************************************************* -->
    <section title="Protocol dependent mapping" anchor="pdm">
      <t>
        Protocol dependent mapping is a mapping that depend on protocol rules.
      </t>
      <section title="Delimiter mapping">
        <t>
          Definitions of delimiters in certain protocols are differ from
          each other.  Therefore, delimiter mapping table should be based on
          well defined mapping table for each protocol.
        </t>
        <t>
          One of the most useful case of delimiter mapping is when FULL STOP
          character (U+002E) is a delimiter as well as domain name.  Some of
          IME generates FULL STOP compatible characters such as IDEOGRAPHIC
          FULL STOP (U+3002) when users type FULL STOP on the keyboard.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Special mapping" anchor="spm"> 
        <t>
          Certain protocols have characters which need to map different character from 
          precis framework defined mapping rule other than delimiter characters.
          In this document, these mappings are named special mapping. They are differ from each protocol.
          Therefore, special mapping table should be based on well defined mapping table for each protocol.
          Examples of special mapping are following;
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>White spaces are mapped to SPACE (U+0020)</t>
            <t>Some characters such as control characters are mapped to nothing (Deletion)</t>
          </list>
          LDAPprep<xref target="RFC4518"/> defines the rule that some codepoints(<xref target="cplist4518"/>) are mapped to SPACE (U+0020). 
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Local case mapping" anchor="lcm">
        <t>
          Local case mapping is case folding that depend on language context.
          For example, given there is upper case I in a user ID strings, you
          should care what's language context that this user ID depend on when
          this character is mapped into lower case character.  And if this
          depends on Turkish, the character should be mapped into LATIN SMALL
          LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131) as this character's lower case.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document defines characters that need local case mapping based on
          the Specialcasing.txt <xref target="Specialcasing"/> in section 3.13
          of The Unicode Standerd <xref target="Unicode"/> to solve such a problem for precis framework.
          
          Local case mapping targets only characters that get two different results to perfom just casefolding
          that is defined in the Casefolding.txt <xref target="Casefolding"/> and perfom special casefolding
          that is defined in the Specialcasing.txt then casefolding, because precis framework have casefolding.
        </t>
        <t>
          There are two types casefoldings defined as Unconditional Mappings and Conditional Mappings in the Specialcasing.txt.
          Conditional mappings have Language-Insensitive Mappings that targets characters whose full case mappings do not depend on language, but do
          depend on context and Language-Sensitive Mappings that these are characters whose full case mappings depend on language and perhaps also
          context.
        </t>
        <t>
          Of these mappings, characters that Unconditional Mappings and Language-Insensitive Mappings in Conditional Mappings target are mapped into
          same codepoint(s) with just casefolding and special casefolding then casefolding.
          But characters that Language-Sensitive Mappings in Conditional Mappings targets are mapped into different codepoint with them.
          Therefore this document defined characters that are a part of characters of Lithuanian(lt), Turkish(tr) and Azerbaijanian(az) that Language-Sensitive Mappings targets
          as targets for local case mapping.
        </t>
        <t>
          Followings are the method to calculate codepoints that local case mapping targets.
          Here Casefolding() means casefolding described in the Casefolding.txt <xref target="Casefolding"/>
          and Specialcasing() means specialcasing described in the Specialcasing.txt <xref target="Specialcasing"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          If Casefolding(Specialcasing(cp)) != Casefolding(cp)<vspace/>
          Then cp is a target<vspace/>
          Else cp is not a target;<vspace/>
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="LCM-list"/> "Code points list for local case mapping" lists codepoints are calculated by this method.

      <t>
        Basically, applying order of mapping that this document describes aren't sensitive.
        This section defines applying order of mapping to minimize effect of codepoint change by mappings.
        This mapping order is very general and was designed to be acceptable to the widest user community.

      <t>
        Followings are cullent open issues for this document.
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>
            Whether is local case mapping belong in additional mappings in precis framework?
          </t>
          <t>
            If local case mapping belong in precis framework, it's necessary to specify mapping order as local case mapping then case mapping.
            Because it makes no sense to perform local case mapping after case mapping.
          </t>
          <t>
            Handling order of precis framework and precis mappings is ambiguous. It's necessary to define the order in precis framework or in this document or in both documents.
