                 draft-hu-i2rs-overlay-use-case-00.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes an overlay network use case.  The forwarding
   routers network is an overlay structure.  There are two kinds of
   forwarding routers: Edge Router(ER) and Core Routers(CR).  Edge
   Router encapsulates format data based on the tunnel type, which are
   established among Edge Routers.  Core Router would be very simple and
   cheap.  It focus on the encapsulation data forwarding.  In order to
   reduce the equipment cost of Edge Routers, the network virtualization
   is provided in this document.

Internet-Draft                I2RS Overlay                      Mar 2013


1.  Introduction

   As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid
   and dynamic control increases.  I2RS([I2RS-FRM]) provide a new
   routing system framework to meet the requirement.  There is a
   programmable interface for the forwarding router.  All the forwarding
   routers should support I2RS agent to communicate with controllers.
   The forwarding routers gather the traffic and topology information,
   report to the controllers, and receive the policy from controllers.

   Besides the idea of programmable and open interface, another key
   feature is forwarding plane and control plane separation in the I2RS
   and software define network.  Some of the control and computing
   function could be separation from traditional routers.  By this way,
   we hope that the service and data encapsulation are all done in the
   routers of the edge of network, and the routers in the core part are
   only focus on data forwarding.  The core routers RIB table could only
   store the network(or equipment) IP prefix, and does not store user(or
   end station) IP prefix anymore.  The RIB and FIB table capability of
   core routers would be reduced significantly, and the equipment cost
   could be lower.  The full mesh tunnel is required for the edge
   Routers.  This is actually an overlay network structure.  The
   forwarding routers in the overlay network are divides into two kinds
   based on the roles in the network: CR(Core Router) and ER(Edge
   Router).The Edge Routers encapsulate the forwarding data based on the
   tunnel type, gather topology information, and report traffic to the
   controller, while Core Routers focus on fast data forwarding and
   receive only policy related information(metadata)from the controller.

                             Figure 1 Overlay Structure

   The overlay structure is shown in Figure 1.  The upper half part of
   the Figure show a physical network.  The Edge Routers are located in
   the edge of the overlay network, and are logically connected through
   Core Routers.The services and data encapsulation are done in the edge
   routers.  The Core Routers are very simple; and focus on the data
   forwarding, and may not perceive any distinction among the tunnels
   to/from Edge Routers.

   The lower half of the Figure shows a logical tunnel network.  All the
   Edge Routers are connected via a logical-full mesh tunnel-based
   connection among them.  The tunnel could be IP/MPLS/OTN tunnel.  Edge
   Router encapsulates/decapsulates the data based on the tunnel type.
   If tunnel type is IP network, the encapsulation format would be IP

   over GRE, or IP over UDP.  If tunnel is MPLS network, the
   encapsulation format is IP over MPLS, which is similar to the MPLS
   data format.  If tunnel is OTN, the tunnel format is IP/Ethernet over
   ODU.

2.2.  The Benefit of Overlay Network Structure

   (1)  Lower cost down for Core Routers: For the Core Router, it is not
        required to compute route, and distribute protocol signal.  The
        Core Routers only store the equipment IP prefix, and do not
        store user IP prefix any more.  The RIB and FIB table for core
        Router are very small.  The size routing tables in the Core
        Routers does not increase and remains stable with the growth of
        the numbers of users.

   (2)  Improved network security: The overlay network structure
        improves network security by splitting(and hence isolating)the
        provider equipment and user station.  The attacks from hacker to
        core routers would therefore be separated by the edge routers.

   (3)  Support of network virtualization: Some of the control and
        computing function could be separated from Edge Router and be
        done by controller.  The edge router in the future is a hardware
        platform.  The service, policy ,and other control function, such
        as route computing, signal distribution can be furnished by
        special physical/virtual servers.  The network virtualization
        for Edge Router is discussed in section 3.

2.3.  Core Router Requirements

   The Core Router performs the following functions:

   (1)  Core Routers mainly focus on fast forwarding encapsulated data.

   (2)  The control plane is very simple.  It announces and floods the
        topology information.

   (3)  For compatibility reasons, Route computation may be needed, but
        is not necessary.

2.4.  Edge Router Requirement

   The edge Router performs the following functions:

   (1)  Access and resources management: Edge Routers support user
        Access authentication, authorization, and resource control and
        management.  When there is new user access network, the edge
        router support user access authentication, authorization.  If

        the subscriber is legal and registered, he/she should should
        pass the access authentication and authorization tests.

   (2)  Topology management:Edge Router gathers the network topology
        information and reports the topology to the controller.  When
        the topology changes, the edge router reports the changes as
        well.

   (3)  Policy management: Edge Router identifies the policy from The
        I2RS Commissioner([I2RS-Policy]).

   (4)  Service management: Edge Router should identifies the services
        and performs the appropriate encapsulation.

   (5)  Route and signal protocol management: Edge Router computes route
        based on the topology information received from other edge
        router and core router.

   (6)  Tunnel control and management: Edge Routers manage and maintain
        tunnel information.  All the edge routers are connected over
        logical full-mesh based tunnel network.

   (7)  Traffic analysis and reporting: Edge router monitors the data
        traffic, and reports the traffic updates/changes.


3.  Network Virtualization(NV)

3.1.  Benefits of Network Virtualization

   (1)  NV reduces ER complexity and equipment costs.

   (2)  NV allows flexibility and rapid deployment of new services;
        services can also be quickly scaled up/down based on demands.

   (3)  Seamless support of scalability and reliability

   (4)  NV allows flexibility and simplicity of function combination,
        for co-existence with hardware based network platform.  An ER
        could be utilized both as BRAS, Firewall, or NAT equipment on
        the same hardware platform.

3.2.  Applications and Requirements

   (1)  Tunnel gateway elements: IPSec/SSL VPN gateway.

   (2)  Traffic analytics: DPI, QoS measurement, SLA agent.

   (3)  Converged and network-wide functions: AAA Server, policy control
        and charging platform.

   (4)  Security function: Firewalls, virus scanners, instruction
        detection and prevention systems.

3.3.  Network Virtualization

   Edge routers can support network virtualization, An ER can be a
   hardware based platform, and the other necessary functions can be
   supported via separate servers A programmable interface between
   functional server and edge router can be used to support this
   paradigm.  When there is new service, we only need to add a new
   server to support that service, and there may be minimal or no
   changes required to the edge router.
