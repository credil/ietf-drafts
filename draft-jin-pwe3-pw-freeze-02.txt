1.  Introduction

   This draft introduces a pseudowire freeze mechanism, which enables
   pseudowire control plane and data plane separation.  When the PW is
   working in freeze state, the data transmission will not be influenced
   by turbulence of control plane (including signaling and PW control
   component), so as to offer to pseudowire [RFC4447] more high
   availability, but with low provisioning cost compared with static
   pseudowire.

   Note that the pseudowire freeze mechanism only applys for pseudowire
   with LDP control plane.

   PWE3 technology has been used as a transport technology, and deployed
   in mobile backhaul or other access/aggregation network.  Most of the
   pizza boxes supporting PWE3 in access network have lower CPU
   performance than that in aggregation/metro/core network, so as to
   reduce the hardware cost.  What's more, sometimes the boxes in
   aggregation network also have low CPU performance.  From the
   currently deployed network, in order to run LDP and other routing
   protocols, we observe that the main controller CPU in pizza box is
   sometimes IP forwarding overloaded.  When LDP session is established,
   the T-LDP hello adjacency may expire because of main controller CPU
   overload, which results the corresponding PW traffic being
   interrupted.

   In MPLS-TP [I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework], it is required that
   the data and control planes are both logically and physically
   separated, which ensures that in the case of control plane failures
   the data plane is not affected and can continue to operate normally.
   While in normal MPLS environment, when PW control plane is DOWN, the
   PW traffic will be interrupted.

                                 Figure 1

   In some network of deploying pseudowire, the PW signaling path is
   different from the data transmission path.  See figure 1, the PSN
   Tunnel is setup along the path of PE1, P and PE2, while the T-LDP
   session is setup along the path of PE1, Router and PE2.  This is
   possible if the PSN tunnel is initiated by RSVP-TE which will
   calculate the path with explicit route, or the path is an inter-
   area/AS one.  In this case, the failure of T-LDP session should not
   influence the pseudowire data traffic.  For example, if the Router in
   figure 1 fails and T-LDP session is DOWN, then PW traffic
   corresponding to this T-LDP session should not be interrupted.

   According to the LDP procedure [RFC5036], if the T-LDP session is
   DOWN, the received label from this session should be deleted and
   corresponding traffic is interrupted.  LDP graceful restart defined
   in [RFC3478] is more appliable for IP Prefix, not PW FEC.  The PW
   information in MPLS forwarding state defined in [RFC3478] section 1
   is not enought for a restarting PE to recover.  And it is also a bit
   complicated for a pizza boxe to implement LDP graceful restart.

   For MPLS-TP network, there are also some network maintenance
   motivations to make PW to be independent from LDP signaling after PW
   being setup successfully.  For example, if the service provider wants
   to adjust some part of the network without influencing the traffic,

Internet-Draft         draft-jin-pwe3-pw-freeze-01             July 2011


   it only needs to care about the transport path of PW without
   considering the dynamic IP path of LDP signaling, which will bring
   the network adjustment to be much easier.

   The PW freeze mechanism can prevent the PW traffic to be interrupted
   when T-LDP session is DOWN or the PW control component on PE is
   corrupted, but PW forwarding engine continues working.


3.  Terminology

   T-LDP: Target LDP.

   PW control component: The processing component on PE, which is
   responsible for PW signaling and management.

   Freezed PW: A PW whose control plane is separated from data plane.


4.  PW freeze mechanism

   The PW freeze mechanism aims to provide a function for PW not to be
   influenced by the turbulence of control plane, which will improve the
   high availability of the PW.  When the PW supports !ofreeze"
   function, once PW is operational UP, it will not be influenced by the
   turbulence of control plane.  When the freezed PW is unfreezed, the
   PW will behave as defined in [RFC4447] and [RFC5036].

   The turbulence of control plane will include instability of signaling
   session and PW control component.  When PW is in "freezed" state, PE
   should have the capability of continuing PW data forwarding without
   PW control component.  In this case, before PW control component is
   failed, PE SHOULD store the PW information in the backup PW control
   component or non-volatile ROM, which is an implementation issue.
   When PW control component is initialized, it SHOULD restore the PW
   information from the backup component.  The specific of above
   procedure depends on implementation and is out of scope of this
   draft.  This draft only deals with the control plane of PW signaling
   session, T-LDP session.  This version of draft only describes the
   case of point-to-point PW, and unidirectional point-to-multipoint PW
   will be studied in future version.

4.1.  PW freeze status encoding and signaling

4.1.1.  PW freeze status definition and encoding

   There will be two state defined for PW in this draft, freezed and
   normal state.  In the freezed state, PW will not be influenced by the



Jin, et al.              Expires January 9, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         draft-jin-pwe3-pw-freeze-01             July 2011


   control plane and continue working and transmitting traffic if
   control plane is DOWN.  In the normal state, also known as unfreezed
   state, the PW will behave as defined in [RFC4447] and [RFC5036], and
   the PW traffic will be interrupted when T-LDP session is DOWN.

   The PW freeze status is encoded in PW status TLV.  The status code
   definition (IANA, TBD) is pre-allocated as 0x00000080.

   When the PW freeze bit is set, it indicates that the PW supports
   "freeze" function, and will be in "freeze" state.

   When the PW freeze bit is cleared, it indicates that the PW will be
   in "unfreeze" status.

4.1.2.  PW freeze status signaling

   When the PW is configured as "freeze", PE SHOULD advertise the
   capability by sending label mapping message carrying the PW status
   TLV with "PW freeze bit" set, or by sending LDP notification message
   carrying the PW status TLV with "PW freeze bit" set.  The PW freeze
   function will be effective only when both endpoints of PW signal the
   "PW freeze" status.

   When one of the PW endpoint signals PW status with PW freeze bit
   cleared, both of the two endpoints should unfreeze the PW.  When PW
   is already in "freeze" state, the PW status should be transmitted
   through generic associated channel, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-static-pw-status], the MAC withdraw message
   transmission should follow [I-D.boutros-pwe3-mpls-tp-mac-wd].

4.2.  PE operation

   If PW supports "freeze" function through negotiation, as in section
   4.1.2:

   1.  When PW is operational UP, PW will enter into the freezed state.
   The PE should locally store the PW information that received from the
   peer node, including PW type, PW label and etc.  For more detail of
   the PW information, please refer to [RFC4447].

   1.a.  When T-LDP session is DOWN, the PE should continue the PW data
   forwarding.  In this case, if the PW on one PE will be deleted or not
   provisioned, before deleting the PW, PE should send PW down status
   bit to peer node through G-ACH.

   1.b.  When T-LDP session switches from DOWN to UP status, and if
   local PW status is DOWN, PE should send PW label mapping message to
   peer node again, with the PW information stored locally.  If peer

Internet-Draft         draft-jin-pwe3-pw-freeze-01             July 2011


   node receives a PW label mapping message with different information
   as stored locally, it should update the PW information.  If local PW
   status is UP, there is no operation for PE.

   2.  When PW is operational DOWN, PW will still in normal state, and
   not enter into the freezed state.

   If PW is configured or signaled to "unfreeze", as in section 4.1.2:

   When PW corresponding T-LDP session is DOWN, PE should delete the
   corresponding PW, and stop forwarding traffic.  To be noted: PE
   should send PW status TLV with !oPW not forwarding!+/- status bit set
   to peer node through G-ACH before completely delete PW locally.

   2.  When PW corresponding T-LDP session is UP, there is no operation
   for PE.

4.3.  Multi-Segment PW freeze function

   For the case of multi-segment PW, only when each PW segment support
   "freeze" function, the MS-PW will support freeze function.  When S-PE
   receives PW status with "PW freeze" bit set, and if the PW segment on
   this S-PE does not support "freeze" function, S-PE will forward this
   PW status with "PW freeze" bit cleared.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the PW freeze status code for the PW freeze
   mechanism.  IANA is requested to allocate these from the PW Status
   Codes registry.  The PW freeze status code definition is pre-
   allocated as 0x00000080.

   When the PW freeze bit is set, it indicates that the PW supports
   "freeze" function, and will be in "freeze" status.

   When the PW freeze bit is cleared, it indicates that the PW will be
   in "unfreeze" status.


6.  Backward compatibility

   The PE that does not support the PW freeze bit in status TLV will
   ignore this bit, and the PW will not enter into freeze status.
