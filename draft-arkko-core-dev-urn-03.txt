             Uniform Resource Names for Device Identifiers
                      draft-arkko-core-dev-urn-03

Abstract

   This memo describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
   hardware device identifiers.  A general representation of device
   identity can be useful in many applications, such as in sensor data
   streams and storage, or equipment inventories.  A URN-based
   representation can be easily passed along in any application that
   needs the information.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141]
   [RFC3406] namespace for hardware device identifiers.  A general
   representation of device identity can be useful in many applications,
   such as in sensor data streams and storage, or equipment inventories
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap], [I-D.jennings-senml],
   [I-D.arkko-core-sleepy-sensors] [I-D.arkko-core-security-arch].  A
   URN-based representation can be easily passed along in any
   application that needs the information, as it fits in protocols
   mechanisms that are designed to carry URNs [RFC2616], [RFC3261],
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  Finally, URNs can also be easily carried and
   stored in formats such as XML [W3C.REC-xml-19980210] or JSON
   [I-D.jennings-senml] [RFC4627].  Using URNs in these formats is often
   preferable as they are universally recognized, self-describing, and
   therefore avoid the need for agreeing to interpret an octet string as
   a specific form of a MAC address, for instance.

   This memo defines identity URN types for situations where no such
   convenient type already exist.  For instance, [I-D.farrell-decade-ni]
   defines cryptographic identifiers, [I-D.montemurro-gsma-imei-urn]
   defines International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI)
   identifiers for use with 3GPP cellular systems, and
   [I-D.atarius-dispatch-meid-urn] defines Mobile Equipment Identity
   (MEID) identifiers for use with 3GPP2 cellular systems.  Those URN
   types should be employed when such identities are transported; this
   memo does not redefine these identifiers in any way.

   Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URNs [RFC4122] are another
   alternative way for representing device identifiers, and already
   support MAC addresses as one of type of an identifier.  However,
   UUIDs can be inconvenient in environments where it is important that
   the identifiers are as simple as possible and where additional
   requirements on stable storage, real-time clocks, and identifier
   length can be prohibitive.  UUID-based identifiers are recommended
   for all general purpose uses when MAC addresses are available as
   identifiers.  The device URN defined in this memo is recommended for
   constrained environments.

   Future device identifier types can extend the device device URN type
   defined here, or define their own URNs.

   The rest of this memo is organized as follows.  Section 3 defines the
   "DEV" URN type, and Section 4 defines subtypes for IEEE MAC-48,
   EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses and 1-wire device identifiers.  Section 5
   gives examples.  Section 6 discusses the security considerations of
   the new URN type.  Finally, Section 7 specifies the IANA registration
   for the new URN type and sets requirements for subtype allocations

   within this type.


2.  Requirements language

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "OPTIONAL",
   "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119].


3.  DEV URN Definition

   Namespace ID: "dev" requested

   Registration Information: This is the first registration of this
   namespace, 2011-08-27.

   Registration version number: 1

   Registration date: 2011-08-27

   Declared registrant of the namespace: IETF and the CORE working
   group.  Should the working group cease to exist, discussion should be
   directed to the general IETF discussion forums or the IESG.

   Declaration of syntactic structure: The identifier is expressed in
   ASCII (UTF-8) characters and has a hierarchical structure as follows:

     devurn = "urn:dev:" body componentpart
     body = macbody / owbody / otherbody
     macbody = "mac:" hexstring
     owbody = "ow:" hexstring
     otherbody = subtype ":" identifier
     subtype = ALPHA *(DIGIT / ALPHA)
     identifier = 1*unreserved
     componentpart = [ ";" component [ componentpart ]]
     component = *1(DIGIT / ALPHA)
     hexstring = hexbyte /
                 hexbyte hexstring
     hexbyte = hexdigit hexdigit
     hexdigit = DIGIT / hexletter
     hexletter = "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f"

   The above Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) uses the DIGIT and ALPHA
   rules defined in [RFC5234], which are not repeated here.  The rule
   for unreserved is defined in Section 2.3 of [RFC3986].

   The device identity namespace includes three subtypes, and more may

Internet-Draft                   DEV URN                       July 2012


   be defined in the future as specified in Section 7.

   The optional components following the hexstring are strings depicting
   individual aspects of a device.  The specific strings and their
   semantics are up to the designers of the device, but could be used to
   refer to specific interfaces or functions within the device.

   Relevant ancillary documentation: See Section 4.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations: Device identifiers are
   generally expected to be unique, barring the accidental issue of
   multiple devices with the same identifiers.

   Identifier persistence considerations: This URN type SHOULD only be
   used for persistent identifiers, such as hardware-based identifiers
   or cryptographic identifiers based on keys intended for long-term
   usage.

   Process of identifier assignment: The process for identifier
   assignment is dependent on the used subtype, and documented in the
   specific subsection under Section 4.

   Process for identifier resolution: The device identities are not
   expected to be globally resolvable.  No identity resolution system is
   expected.  Systems may perform local matching of identities to
   previously seen identities or configured information, however.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence: The lexical equivalence of the DEV URN
   is defined as an exact and case sensitive string match.  Note that
   the two subtypes defined in this document use only lower case
   letters, however.  Future types might use identifiers that require
   other encodings that require a more full-blown character set (such as
   BASE64), however.

   Conformance with URN Syntax: The string representation of the device
   identity URN and of the MEID sub namespace is fully compatible with
   the URN syntax.

   Validation Mechanism: Specific subtypes may be validated through
   mechanisms discussed in Section 4.

   Scope: DEV URN is global in scope.


4.  DEV URN Subtypes

4.1.  MAC Addresses

   DEV URNs of the "mac" subtype are based on the EUI-64 identifier
   [IEEE.EUI64] derived from a device with a built-in 64-bit EUI-64.
   The EUI-64 is formed from 24 or 36 bits of organization identifier
   followed by 40 or 28 bits of device-specific extension identifier
   assigned by that organization.

   In the DEV URN "mac" subtype the hexstring is simply the full EUI-64
   identifier represented as a hexadecimal string.  It is always exactly
   16 characters long.

   MAC-48 and EUI-48 identifiers are also supported by the same DEV URN
   subtype.  To convert a MAC-48 address to an EUI-64 identifier, The
   OUI of the Ethernet address (the first three octets) becomes the
   organization identifier of the EUI-64 (the first three octets).  The
   fourth and fifth octets of the EUI are set to the fixed value FFFF
   hexadecimal.  The last three octets of the Ethernet address become
   the last three octets of the EUI-64.  The same process is used to
   convert an EUI-48 identifier, but the fixed value FFFE is used
   instead.

   Identifier assignment for all of these identifiers rests within the
   IEEE.

4.2.  1-Wire Device Identifiers

   The 1-Wire* system is a device communications bus system designed by
   Dallas Semiconductor Corporation. 1-Wire devices are identified by a
   64-bit identifier that consists of 8 byte family code, 48 bit
   identifier unique within a family, and 8 bit CRC code [OW].

      *) 1-Wire is a registered trademark.

   In DEV URNs with the "ow" subtype the hexstring is a representation
   of the full 64 bit identifier as a hexadecimal string.  It is always
   exactly 16 characters long.  Note that the last two characters
   represent the 8-bit CRC code.  Implementations MAY check the validity
   of this code.

   Family code and identifier assignment for all 1-wire devices rests
   with the manufacturers.


5.  Examples

   The following three examples provide examples of MAC-based, 1-Wire,
   and Cryptographic identifiers:

                                               # humidity part

       urn:dev:ow:264437f5000000ed;temperature # The laundry sensor's
                                               # temperature part



6.  Security Considerations

   On most devices, the user can display device identifiers.  Depending
   on circumstances, device identifiers may or may not be modified or
   tampered by the user.  An implementation of the DEV URN MUST NOT
   change these properties from what they were intended.  In particular,
   a device identifier that is intended to be immutable should not
   become mutable as a part of implementing the DEV URN type.  More
   generally, nothing in this memo should be construed to override what
   the relevant device specifications have already said about the
   identifiers.

   Other devices in the same network may or may not be able to identify
   the device.  For instance, on Ethernet network, the MAC address of a
   device is visible to all other devices.


7.  IANA Considerations

   Additional subtypes for DEV URNs can be defined through IETF Review
   or IESG Approval [RFC5226].

Appendix A.  Changes from Previous Version

   Version -02 introduced several changes.  The biggest change is that
   with the NI URNs [I-D.farrell-decade-ni], it was no longer necessary
   to define cryptographic identifiers in this specification.  Another
   change was that we incorporated a more generic syntax for future
   extensions; non-hexstring identifiers can now also be supported, if
   some future device identifiers for some reason would, for instance,
   use BASE64.  As a part of this change, we also changed the component
   part separator character from '-' to ';' so that the general format
   of the rest of the URN can employ the unreserved characters
   [RFC3986].


Appendix B.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Ari Keranen, Stephen Farrell,
   Christer Holmberg, Peter Saint-Andre, Wouter Cloetens, and Ahmad
   Muhanna for interesting discussions in this problem space.  We would
   also like to note prior documents that focused on specific device
   identifiers, such as [I-D.montemurro-gsma-imei-urn] or
   [I-D.atarius-dispatch-meid-urn].
