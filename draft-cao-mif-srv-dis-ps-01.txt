Abstract

   This document analyzes the problem of service discovery in a multiple
   connection environment.  A multiple connection environment consists
   of multiple-interfaces nodes connecting to multiple networks or
   multiple provisioning domains.  Given a type of service a multiple-
   interfaced client is looking for, the discovery progress ought to
   return a correct pointer to the service instance that the client is
   able to access.

1.  Introduction

   A multihomed host have multiple provisioning domains via physical
   and/or virtual interfaces.  A multihomed host receives node
   configuration information from each of its access networks, through
   various mechanisms such as DHCP, PPP and IPv6 Router Advertisements.
   When the received node-scoped configuration objects have different
   values from each administration domains, such as different DNS
   servers IP addresses, different default gateways or different address
   selection policies, the node has to decide which it will use or how
   it will merge them.

   Issues regarding how the multi-homed host uses the configuration
   objects have been addresses in [RFC6418].  Current practices of how
   the various implementations handle these problems are introduced in
   [RFC6419].  DNS based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) has been specified
   in [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd].  And
   [I-D.ietf-mif-dns-server-selection] extends DHCPv6 to inform the host
   which DNS server it ought to select to send the query request.

   This document analyzes the problem of service discovery in a multiple
   connection environment.  A multiple connection environment consists
   of multiple-interfaces nodes connecting to multiple networks or
   multiple provisioning domains.  Given a type of service a multiple-
   interfaced client is looking for, the discovery progress ought to
   return a correct pointer to the service instance that the a client is
   able to access.

3.  Problem Analysis

   The following figure shows where and how the problem arises.  The
   host with multiple interfaces is a common case in today's mobile
   Internet.  On the service domain, different services are deployed and
   some services may not be accessible to a certain interface on the
   host.  The service discovery process should return a correct point to
   the host and makes sure that the host can access the service via this
   pointer.  This situation makes the multiple interface service
   discovery different from the one-interface scenario.

   The service discovery process can be summarized as query request,
   query handling and response, and service access.

   1.  Determine Service Discovery Server: the host determines which
       interface it should send a query request.

   2.  Service Query Request: the host sends a query request to find a
       service.  The query should include a description of the service,
       for example, a full-qualified domain name, a URI, or an
       application-specific naming of the service.

Internet-Draft              MIF SRV Discovery              November 2012


   3.  Service Request Handling: any entity that receives the query
       request should handle the request.  The entity should understand
       the meaning of the request, and check the semantics of the
       request language before giving an answer back.

   4.  Service Query Response: the entity that receives the query
       request should reply with an answer to the query.  The answer
       should include a pointer to the service.

   5.  Service Access: the host accesses the service via the pointer
       provided in the query response.  The host is supposed to be able
       to get the service instance via the pointer under a successful
       and efficient service discovery mechanism, unless the servers in
       such service domain encounter problems e.g. a web server is down.

   The problems that a multiple-interfaced host may meet during the
   service discovery include:

   1.  How the query requests are sent?  Because there are multiple
       interfaces available and multiple service rendezvous existing,
       the host should decide which destination it ought to send the
       query to.  And if there is a round-robin mechanism, the host
       should determine the order of the query request.

   2.  How to handle the query and reply?  Some pointers to the service
       are restricted to a local scope or a certain interface, e.g., an
       office printer may not be accessible to the 3G-interface.  The
       service discovery process is supposed to return a pointer that is
       accessible to the host.

   3.  How to access the service?  Given the pointer to the service, the
       host should be able to determine from which interface it can
       access the service.

   In a DNS based service discovery, the problem of domain split is
   analyzed in the MIF-DNS-Selection document
   [I-D.ietf-mif-dns-server-selection].  The MIF-DNS-Selection document
   actually defines an extension to the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 to inform the
   MIF host which domain scope the Recursive DNS Server(RDNSS) is
   serving for, so that the "service query request" can be sent to the
   correct RDNSS to get an answer.  This method resolves the partial
   problem in the service discovery process mentioned above.

   In a more complicated network, as what is shown in Figure 2 , the
   host connects to the enterprise network via the wired interface, a
   WLAN network with the 802.11 interface, and an operator's network via
   the cellular interface.  The three intranets have their own Firewall
   policies to the global Internet.  On the enterprise network, many

   outgoing ports are restricted, and on the WLAN and operator's public
   network, there is more freedom.  If the MIF host makes a DNS-SRV
   query to a service in a global domain, all the RDNS servers have the
   corresponding records.  But say the service port number has been
   blocked by the enterprise network administrator, the DNS has no such
   information.  Even if the DNS returns a pointer to the MIF host, the
   MIF host cannot access this service via the wired interface.

      Figure 2: Scenario of Multiple Interface DNS Service Discovery

   As a summary of the above analysis, the general problems and
   requirements of service discovery in a MIF environment can be
   summarized as follows:

   Service Directory Service Configuration:   Service directory is the
      entity that store or can get the stored relationship between
      service names and service pointers.  Different interfaces or
      provisioning domains have their different service directories.
      How to configure them on the MIF host and how the MIF host utilize
      the configured information are important for the service discovery
      process to behave correctly.

Internet-Draft              MIF SRV Discovery              November 2012


   Service Directory Selection:   After the service directory
      information is configured on the host, the host is able to select
      the correct directory to send the query.  The host can utilize
      auxiliary information available or send the query to all the
      directories that have been configured.  The behavior of MIF host
      to select a correct directory is also important for a stable
      system.

   Service Pointer/Address Resolution:  The same service may have
      different available addresses and pointers, and some service has
      limited connectivity.  So the resolution process should be able to
      return to the MIF host a record that is accessible from at least
      one of the interfaces.

   Service Route Selection:  With the pointers returned, the host should
      route the service level data to the service instance identified by
      the return pointers.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA requests.


5.  Security Considerations

   The query response exchanges should be protected by security
   mechanisms.  If the response contains invalid information, e.g. a
   pointer to a worm website, it harms.  As a consequence, the service
   discovery should protect bogus information injected by attackers or
   intruders.  The security consideration ought to be made by the
   underlining protocols, and it is out of scope of this problem
   statement document.
