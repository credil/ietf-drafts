Internet-Draft   Principles for Flow Control in HTTP 2.0   December 2012


1.  Introduction

   HTTP/2.0 introduces multiplexed streams over a given TCP connection.
   In HTTP 1.X, there is no interleaving of Request/Response pairs.
   Thus, any flow control issues are mostly left to the underlying TCP
   implementation.  In HTTP 2.0, each Request/Response pair uses a
   separate stream, sharing the same TCP connection with other such
   pairs over different streams.  All such streams will be vying for a
   common underlying resource of a single TCP connection.  Given that
   this interaction among all the streams is not visible to the TCP
   implementation, handling the interaction among them has to be solved
   at the HTTP 2.0 multiplexing layer.  There are issues of
   prioritization, head-of-line blocking and flow control.  Perhaps the
   most complex aspect is that of flow control.  It may be that flow
   control for HTTP 2.0 multiplexing will follow a path similar to what
   TCP's complex dynamics have followed throughout the years.  In
   particular, TCP congestion control has seen a constant progress of
   improved specifications based on measurements and research of the
   networking community.  What the TCP community recognized early on was
   that this was a hard problem.  Thus, the best course of action was to
   agree on a minimal set of rules or principles (e.g., TCP
   "friendliness").  Many TCP congestion control algorithms are then
   possible as a (mostly) local implementation issue giving rise to TCP
   Reno, Tahoe, Vegas, CTCP, and many more.

   Flow control for HTTP 2.0 multiplexing over TCP is also a complex
   issue.  This document proposes (1) a set of principles aimed at
   preventing egregious behavior, while allowing for future and ongoing
   improvement of flow control algorithms, and (2) a simple flow control
   algorithm that could be implemented in the absence of better schemes
   (TBD).  Other flow control algorithms with subsequent improvements
   should be specified in separate documents without encumbering nor
   delaying the base HTTP 2.0 specification.  This is similar to how the
   myriad TCP congestion algorithms published so far have been specified
   separately from the base TCP documents.

   The goal of this document is to propose additional text to the
   HTTP/2.0 specification.  The starting point for HTTP/2.0, the SPDY
   [I-D.mbelshe-httpbis-spdy] protocol, does not have much language with
   respect to flow control.  Hence, the text below is offered as a new
   section or sections within the HTTP/2.0 document.

2.  Principles for Flow Control in HTTP 2.0 Multiplexing

   Flow control for Multiplexing in HTTP 2.0 must follow these
   principles:

   1.  Flow control is hop by hop (where "hop" means an HTTP 2.0 hop),
       and not end-to-end.

   2.  Flow control is based on window update messages.  It is
       essentially a credit-based scheme.

   3.  Flow control is directional and is determined by the receiver.
       Flow control MAY be declared by the receiver and MUST be heeded
       by the sender.  For example, a client, a server or a proxy (in
       their role as a "receiver") independently advertise their flow
       control preference.  The other side when operating as a "sender"
       must heed that preference.

   4.  Flow control in the direction towards the receiver can be OFF or
       ON as determined by the receiver.  It is OFF if no flow control
       is advertised by the receiver, or if the receiver declares
       "infinite" credit to the sender.

   5.  HTTP 2.0 should only standardize the format of the window update
       message and its semantics.  In particular, the algorithms used by
       the receiver to decide when to send window update messages, and
       how much to update the window by, are not mandated in the spec.
       The draft should, however, provide some illustrative examples.

   NOTE: Whether flow control operates on a per-stream basis, on a per-
   session (per-TCP connection) basis or on both a per-stream and a per-
   session basis is TBD.

   The spec will not define the algorithms the sender will use to manage
   priorities among streams and to minimize head of the line blocking.
   This is included for completeness, but is essentially independent of
   flow-control.
