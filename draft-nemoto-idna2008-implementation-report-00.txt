Internet-Draft               IDNA2008 imple                February 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document is a report of implementation experience to evaluate
   whether IDNA2008 [RFC5890][RFC5891][RFC5892][RFC5893][RFC5894] can
   implement, IDNA2008 implementation have Unicode agility, and
   providing mapping methods based on [RFC5895] and [TR46] for
   applications are useful.

   In this document, two implementations based on IDNA2008 are
   described.  The one provides support functions for various
   manipulations of internationalized domain names.  It is to evaluate
   whether core protocol of IDNA2008 can implement and the
   implementation provides useful mappings for applications.  The other
   generates idnabis-tables.xml by using Unicode properties files.  It
   is to evaluate whether IDNA2008 implementation has Unicode agility.
   This document reports implementation experience of IDNA2008 and
   findings from the experience.

2.  Experience

2.1.  Purposes

   Purposes of the implementations are following;

   o  To evaluate whether core protocol of IDNA2008 can implement.

   o  To evaluate whether IDNA2008 implementation has Unicode agility.

   o  To evaluate whether providing mappings of [RFC5895] and [TR46] for
      applications are useful.

2.2.  Implementations

   In this document, two implementations based on IDNA2008 are
   described.

   The one based on core protocol of IDNA2008 provides APIs for handling
   internationalized domain names.  Those APIs are for A/U-label
   conversion, two labels comparison and label validity check.  The
   implementation is to evaluate whether core protocol of IDNA2008 can
   be implemented and providing mappings for applications are useful.
   The implementation also provide three command for convert, compare
   and check of internationalized domain names for end users.

   The implementation can import tables of certain version of Unicode
   properties and corresponding idnabis-tables.xml for codepoint
   validation.

   The other implementation generates idnabis-tables.xml based on
   [RFC5892] by using Unicode properties files.  The idnabis-
   tables.xml's format is the same as idnabis-tables.xml published by
   IANA.  This implementation is for the APIs can have Unicode agility
   by using idnabis-tables.  The generator is for evaluating latest
   Unicode version before IANA publish idnabis-tables.xml for the
   Unicode version.

3.  Findings

   Findings from implementation experiences are following.

   o  IDNA2008 core protocol [RFC5890][RFC5891]
      [RFC5892][RFC5893][RFC5894] can implement.

   o  IDNA2008 implementation can have Unicode agility.  Originally, it
      complied with Unicode 5.2.0 based on [RFC5892].  And it is easily
      complying with Unicode 6.0.0 based on [RFC6452].  Further, it can
      comply with Unicode 6.1.0 by using the idnabis-tables.xml
      generator.

   o  This implementation is able to choice a method of mappings based
      on [RFC5895] or [TR46].  It is expected to improve the usability
      of user input.  And also it can facilitate the transition from
      IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.  But which is preferable mappings of
      [RFC5895] or [TR46] is not determined yet.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Unicode agility depends on the agility that IANA publishes the latest
   idnabis-tables.xml when Unicode version was updated.  IANA is
   expected to publish the latest idnabis-tables.xml, when latest
   Unicode version is published.

5.  Security Considerations

   The implementation does not warn and handle strings with care when
   input strings are consisted from mixed scripts.  To avoid user's
   confusion and unwanted access to phishing sites, the application
   policy about user interface and the domain name registration policy
   should take into consideration for using mixed scripts.

   validity according to [RFC5892] and generate tables[createtables].
