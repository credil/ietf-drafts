Internet-Draft              Mail Trace Fields               January 2012


1.  Background

   RFC 822 [RFC822] defined Trace fields as fields providing trace
   information and which are used to provide an audit trail of message
   handling.  Two header fields were defined as trace fields; the
   "Received" header field and the "Return-Path" header field.  RFC 2822
   [RFC2822] defined trace fields as a group of header fields consisting
   of an optional "Return-Path" header field, and one or more
   "Received:" fields.  Restrictions on the syntax of trace fields and
   the usage were provided in RFC 2821 [RFC2821].

   RFC 2821 [RFC2821] defined trace information in terms of the
   information that must be supplied.  It also specifies that SMTP
   servers must prepend "Received" header fields and that the order of
   exiting "Received" header fields must not be changed.  The "Return-
   Path" header field is specified as being inserted at the top of
   header fields at the time of final delivery.

   RFC 5322 [RFC5322] uses the same definition as in the previous
   paragraph and refers to RFC 5321 [RFC5322] for any formal
   interpretation.

1.1.  Note

   This Internet-Draft can be discussed on the apps-discuss@ietf.org
   mailing list.  [RFC-Editor: please remove this paragraph]


2.  Trace fields in mail-related specifications

   RFC 4408 [RFC4408] defines the "Received-SPF" header field as a trace
   field and specifies that it must appear above all other "Received-
   SPF" header fields.

   RFC 4871 [RFC4871] specifies that the "DKIM-Signature" header field
   should be treated as a trace field and that it should not be
   reordered.  It mentions that the header field should be prepended to
   the message.  DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) [RFC4871] relies on
   maintaining the ordering of header fields as a change of any "DKIM
   signed" header field can invalidate the DKIM signature.

   RFC 5451 [RFC5451] defines an "Authentication-Results" header field.
   It mentions that the field should be treated as a Trace field to get
   an idea of how far away authentication checks, such as DKIM and
   Sender Policy Framework [RFC4408] were done.

   RFC 5518 [RFC5518] defines a "VBR-Info" header field and mentions
   that a message may contain multiple occurences of these header

   fields.  The document relies on the terminology in RFC 5322 [RFC5322]
   to say that the "VBR-Info" header field is a "trace header field".
   It also specifies that the header fields should be added at the top
   of the header fields.


3.  Trace field property

   The desired property of a Trace field is that any header field
   defined as a Trace field should not be reordered within a message
   header block or changed.  In addition, a new Trace field should be
   added to the top of the message header block.  This makes it possible
   to infer, for example, which header field was added last.

   There can be zero or more occurences of a Trace field in a message
   header block.


4.  Trace information

   "Received" header fields are a useful aid in detecting problems such
   as slow relays.  They can also be used to determine the path a
   message took from mail submission to final delivery.  "Received"
   header fields are sometimes referred to as "time stamp lines" as they
   contain a date and time.

   The "Return-Path" header field is a special case; it is used to
   preserve the reverse-path address as the message leaves the SMTP
   environment.


5.  Trace field implementation

   Over the years, the practice has been to add header fields which do
   not provide trace information to the bottom of the message header
   block.  The implementation of RFC 4871, RFC 5451 and RFC 5518 was
   possible without changes to SMTP implementations as there was an API
   to interface with some implementations.


6.  Issues

   a.  The recommendation that trace header fields should be kept in
       blocks is not always followed.  Implementations add any new
       header field at the top of the message block without determining
       whether it is a trace header field.

   b.  Messages can be forwarded by users.  Adding trace information as
       part of the body of the forwarded message ends up confusing
       users.  The trace information is generally not relevant except
       for debugging mail delivery issues.

   c.  Should Trace fields be identified in the Permanent Message Header
       Field Names Registry?  Currently, there are 111 entries for the
       mail protocol.


7.  Security Considerations

   Some people view the disclosure of trace information as a security
   risk as it may contain information about internal mail servers.
   There are misguided attempts to strip "Received" header fields to
   hide information.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action by IANA.
