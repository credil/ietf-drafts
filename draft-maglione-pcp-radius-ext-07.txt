           RADIUS Extensions for Port Control Protocol (PCP)
                    draft-maglione-pcp-radius-ext-07

Abstract

   This document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial In User
   Service (RADIUS) attribute to carry a Port Control Protocol (PCP)
   Server Names.  This attribute can be configured on a RADIUS server so
   that the information can be conveyed to Network Access Server (NAS)
   via RADIUS protocol, and the co-located Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP/DHCPv6) server can then populate the information to
   PCP client.

1.  Introduction

   Port Control Protocol (PCP) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] provides a mechanism
   to control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices
   such as NATs and firewalls.  PCP is a client/server protocol where a
   PCP client may reside on a host, a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE),
   etc., which communicates with a PCP server that may reside anywhere
   in a network.

   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] defines a procedure for the PCP client to
   communicate with its PCP Server.  The IP address of the PCP Server(s)
   can be configured to the PCP client; if not the PCP client assumes
   its default router as being its PCP server.

   [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] defines DHCPv6 and DHCPv4 options which are meant
   to be used by a PCP client to discover a PCP server name.  However,
   provisioning for name of the PCP server is required on a DHCPv4/
   DHCPv6 server before it can populate this information.

   Auto-configuration on a DHCPv4/DHCPv6 is possible in a broadband
   network, where typically, user profile is maintained on a Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server and RADIUS
   protocol [RFC2865] is used to convey user-related information to
   other network elements including a host and CPE.
   [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access] describes a typical broadband network
   scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS) acts as the access
   gateway for the users (hosts or CPEs) and the NAS embeds a DHCPv6

   Server function that allows it to locally handle any DHCPv6 requests
   issued by the clients.

   In such environment, PCP server's name can be configured on a RADIUS
   server, which then passes the information to a NAS that co-locates
   with the DHCPv4/DHCPv6 server, which in turn populates the location
   of the PCP server.

   This document defines a new RADIUS attribute that can be used to
   carry a PCP server name.  As defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp], a PCP
   Server Name can be a DNS name, IP literals strings, etc.  This
   document is designed to allow for configuring PCP Server name which
   can be a DNS name, IP literals or any strings which may be passed to
   a local name resolution library on the PCP client side.  Multiple
   occurrences of the PCP server name RADIUS attribute is supported.

   The proposed RADIUS attribute is designed to accommodate various
   deployment contexts (e.g., dedicated option per IP connectivity
   context, single option for dual-stack access, etc.).

   The approach described above is already used for providing the FQDN
   of the AFTR in the DS-Lite scenario [RFC6333] and the equivalent
   RADIUS attribute for the DS-Lite Tunnel Name is defined [RFC6519].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]:

      - Port forwarding
      - PCP
      - PCP client
      - PCP Server

   The following term is defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp]:

      - PCP Server Name

3.  PCP Server Configuration using RADIUS and DHCPv4/DHCPv6

   Figure 1 illustrates an example of how RADIUS protocol works together
   with DHCPv6, to allow a host to learn automatically the name of a PCP
   server in case of a PPP session that carries IPv6 traffic.

   The Network Access Server (NAS) operates as a client of RADIUS and
   co-locates with a DHCPv6 Server for DHCPv6.  The NAS initially sends
   a RADIUS Access Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting
   authentication.  Once the RADIUS server receives the request, it
   validates the sending client and if the request is approved, the
   RADIUS server replies with an Access Accept message including a list
   of attribute-value pairs that describe the parameters to be used for
   this session.  This list MAY also contain the name of a PCP server.
   When the co-located DHCPv6 server receives a DHCPv6 message
   containing the PCP Server Option, it SHALL use the name returned in
   the RADIUS attribute as defined in this memo to populate the DHCPv6
   PCP Server option defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp].

   The Figure 2 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work
   together to accomplish PCP client configuration when DHCPv6 is used
   to provide connectivity to a requesting host.

   The difference between this message flow and previous one is that in
   this scenario the interaction between NAS and AAA/ RADIUS Server is

   DHCPv6 client, while in case of a PPP Session the trigger is the PPP
   LCP Config Request message received by the NAS.

        Figure 2: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Message Flow for an IP Session

   In the scenario depicted in Figure 2 the Access-Request packet
   contains a Service-Type attribute with the value Authorize Only (17),
   thus according to [RFC5080] the Access-Request packet MUST contain a
   State attribute.

   In case that the PCP server name is re-configured, the RADIUS server
   must send a RADIUS CoA message [RFC5176] that carries the RADIUS PCP
   server name attribute to the NAS, which once accepts and sends back a
   RADIUS CoA ACK message, the new PCP server name replaces the original
   one and is then re-propulated by the DHCPv6 server.

   A similar message flow also applies to the IPv4 scenario when DHCPv4
   is used to provide connectivity to the user (Figure 3).

        Figure 3: RADIUS and DHCPv4 Message Flow for an IP Session

   After receiving the PCP server name in the initial Access-Accept the
   NAS MUST store the received PCP Server Name locally.  When the PCP
   Client sends a DHCPv4 message to request an extension of the
   lifetimes for the assigned address or prefix, the NAS does not have
   to initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA server to request
   the PCP server name.  The NAS retrieves the previously stored PCP
   Server name and uses it in its reply.

   If the DHCPv4 server to which the DHCP Renew message was sent at time
   T1 has not responded, the DHCPv4 client initiates a Rebind/Reply
   exchange with any available server.  In this scenario the NAS MUST
   initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA server, after the co-
   located DHCPv4 server receives the DHCP message.  The NAS MAY include
   the PCP Server Name attribute in its Access-Request.

   If the NAS does not receive the PCP server name attribute in the
   Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default tunnel
   name, if any.  If the NAS does not have any pre-configured default
   tunnel name or if the NAS receives an Access-Reject, the PCP client
   can not be configured by the NAS.

   The handling when the PCP server name is re-configured on the RADIUS
   server is similar to that in IPv6 case, i.e., the new PCP server name
   is conveyed to the NAS in a RADIUS CoA message, which if accepted,
   the new PCP server name replaces the original one and is then re-
   propulated by the DHCPv4 server.

   The scenario with PPP Session and IPv4 only connectivity does not
   require DHCPv4: the whole configuration of the client is performed by
   PPP.  This case is out of scope of this document because in order to
   complete the configuration of the PCP client a new PPP IPC option
   would be required.

4.  PCP-Server-Name RADIUS Attribute

   A new RADIUS attribute, called PCP-Server-Name, along with its format
   is defined below.

   The PCP-Server-Name attribute contains a name that refers to a PCP
   server the client requests to establish a connection to for PCP
   related service.  The NAS shall use the name(s) returned in the
   RADIUS PCP-Server-Name attribute instance(s) to populate the PCP
   Server Name DHCP Sub-Option in IPv4 addressing context, or the PCP
   Server Name DHCPv6 Option in IPv6 addressing context, as determined
   by the DHCP server [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp].  The same or distinct PCP
   Server Names MAY be configured; it is out of scope of this document
   to elaborate on this point.  Nevertheless, the PCP-Server-Name
   attribute conveys an indication for the deployment context.

   The PCP-Server-Name attribute MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet.
   This attribute MAY be used in Access-Request packets as a hint to the
   RADIUS server; for example if the NAS is pre-configured with a
   default PCP server name, this name MAY be inserted in the attribute.
   The RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint sent by the NAS and it MAY
   assign a different PCP Server name.  If the NAS includes the PCP
   Server Name attribute, but the AAA server does not recognize it, this
   attribute MUST be ignored by the AAA Server.  If the NAS does not
   receive PCP Server Name attribute in the Access-Accept it MAY
   fallback to a pre-configured default PCP server name, if any.  If the
   NAS is pre-provisioned with a default PCP server name and the PCP
   server name received in Access-Accept is different from the
   configured default, then the PCP server name received in the Access-
   Accept message MUST be used for the session.

   The PCP server Name RADIUS attribute MAY be present in Accounting-
   Request records where the Acct-Status-Type is set to Start, Stop or
   Interim-Update.

   The PCP server name RADIUS attribute MAY be present in an CoA-Request
   packet, when the PCP server name is re-configured.

   The PCP Server Name RADIUS attribute MAY appear more than once in a
   message.

   A summary of the PCP-Server-Name RADIUS attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.
