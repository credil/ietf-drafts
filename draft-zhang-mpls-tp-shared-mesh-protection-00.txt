Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Shared Mesh Protection            July 2011


1.  Introduction

   For shared mesh protection, the protection resources are used to
   protect multiple LSPs which do not all share the same end points.  In
   this way, mesh protection can substantially reduce the network
   resources that have to be reserved in oder to provide protection.
   The requirements have been described in [RFC5654] (Req. 66, 67, 68
   and 69 ).  Furthermore, the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
   Survivability Framework [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk] outlined the
   operation.  The shared mesh recovery schemes are also discussed in
   [RFC4428] and [G.smp].  In (1:1)^n protection decribed in [RFC4428],
   n working paths are protected by n dedicated protection paths while
   sharing the same protection bandwidth.

   This document describes a shared mesh protection processing based on
   the concept of (1:1)^n recovery scheme defined in [RFC4428], and on
   the protecion mechanism being developed in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-linear-protection] [I-D.ezy-mpls-1ton-protection].

3.  Shared Mesh Protection Architecture

   A simple case of shared mesh protection is illustrated in Figure 1.
   Consider three paths W1 [via nodes A, B, C], W3 [via nodes D, E, F]
   and W2 [via nodes X, Y, Z].  For these working paths do not share end
   points, they cannot make use of 1:N protection even though they also
   do not share any common points of failure.  W1 may be protected by
   the path P1 [via nodes A, G, P, Q, H, C}, W3 may be protected by the
   path P3 [via nodes D, I, S, T, J, F], and W2 may be protected by the
   path P2 [via nodes X, V, P, Q, R, S, T, W, Z].  For all these cases,
   1:1 protection may be used.

   In the event that the failure only affect one of the working paths,
   the shared segment PQ or/and ST only carry traffic from the working
   path being affected.  Thus, it is possible for the network resources
   on the segment PQ and ST to be shared by the two protection paths.
   In this way, shared mesh protection can substantially reduce the
   amount of network resources that have to be reserved to provide
   protection.

3.1.  Planning

   As described in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk], the network becomes
   more and more complex and the number of LSPs increases, the potential
   for shared mesh protection also increase.  However, this can quickly
   become unmanageable owing to the increased complexity.  Therefore,
   shared mesh protection is normally pre-planned and configured by the
   operator, although an automated sytem cannot be ruled out.  This will
   include but not limited to:

   o  Planning the shared mesh protection group (SMPG) which includes
      the protected paths and protecting paths.  Different SPMGs do not
      share protection resources and are protected independently.  This
      means that working paths which have the higher protection



Zhang & He               Expires January 5, 2012                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Shared Mesh Protection            July 2011


      switching priority are planned to be in different SMPGs, in such a
      way the higher priority paths will be protected mostly when one
      failure affects different SMPGs.

   o  Configuring the mumbers of the SMPG.  The working paths are
      disjoint as far as possible in one SMPG, so they will not be
      subject to common failures.  Furthermore, each of the working
      paths may be assigned a relative priority that could be used to
      decide which working path would be protected in cases of conflict.
      The relative priority is recommend to be reflected by the entity
      number of the working path, which is compatible with 1:N linear
      protection [I-D.ezy-mpls-1ton-protection].  When equal priority
      requests occur simultaneously, the conflict is resolved in favour
      of the request with the lowest entity number.


4.  Changes to PSC

   Protection State Coordination Protocol (PSC) defined in
   [I-D.ezy-mpls-1ton-protection] is a multi-phased protocol, the end-
   points perform any protection switching with waiting for
   acknowledgement from the far end Label Edge Router (LER).  The
   protocol messages are transmitted using the G-ACh.

   In order to support shared mesh protection, there is a need to make
   changes to the format of the PSC message.  In particular there is the
   need to carry TTL TLV [I-D.ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-ttl-tlv] as one
   optional TLV to indicate which node to receive the return PSC
   message.  Due to this change, the value of the Ver field for PSC
   messages for a shared mesh protection domain MUST be set to 3.

5.  Basic Operation

   This section illustrates the basic operation of the shared mesh
   protection for the topology shown in Figure 1 based on the PSC.

   If a unidirectional failure occurs on the W2 in the direction from
   node Z to node X at time zero, the shared mesh protection will
   operate as follows:

   a.  Node X detects the signal failure (SF), sends SF(2,0) to node P
       with MPLS label TTL to control the hops between the node X and
       node P. TTL TLV may be inserted in the PSC message as one
       optional TLV to indicate that node P SHOULD use this value to
       return the PSC message.
   b.  Node P compares the protection switching priority of W2 and W1.
       For W1 is in normal state, node P sends SF(2,0) to node P with
       MPLS label TTL to control the hops between the node P and node Q,
       similarly, TTL TLV may be inserted in the PSC message as one
       optional TLV to indicate that node S SHOULD use this value to
       return the PSC message.  The same processing is done on node S
       and node T.
   c.  When Node Z receives the PSC message, it bridges and selects
       traffic from P2.  Then sends NR(0,2)Ack to node T, TTL TLV may be
       inserted in the PSC message for the same reason.
   d.  Node T, S, Q, P relay the message until it arrives at node X.
   e.  Node X bridges and selects traffic from P2, then sends SF(2,2).
       When node Z receives this message, it responses with NR(0,2).

5.1.  Preemption

   If a unidirectional failure occurs on the W1 in the direction from
   node C to node A at time one, the shared mesh protection will operate
   as follows:

   a.  Node A detects the SF on W1, sends SF(1,0) to node P with MPLS
       label TTL to control the hops between the node A and node P. TTL
       TLV may be inserted in the PSC message as one optional TLV to
       indicate that node P SHOULD use this value to return the PSC
       message.
   b.  Node P compares the protection switching priority of W2 and W1.
       For W1's entity number is samller than W2's, it has the higher
       priority under the SF events on both working paths.  So node P
       sends SF(1,0) on the path P1, and sends LO(2,2) on the path P2.
   c.  Node Q relays the message SF(1,0) on the path P1 to node A, and
       sends LO(2,2) to node S when it receives LO(2,2) from the
       previous hop on the path P2.

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP Shared Mesh Protection            July 2011


   d.  When Node C receives the SF(1,0) message, it bridges and selects
       traffic from P1 and sends NR(0,1)Ack to node Q, TTL TLV may be
       inserted in the PSC message for the same reason.  While node Z
       receives the LO(2,2) message, it bridges and selects traffic from
       W2, and responses with NR(0,0).  It should be noted that this may
       cause loss of user data since W1 is still in a failure condition.
   e.  Node A bridges and selects traffic from P1, then sends SF(1,1)
       when it receives NR(0,1)Ack. Node C will response with NR(0,1)
       while receives this message.  According to the received NR(0,0),
       node X will bridge and select traffic from W2, and response with
       SF(2,0), then node P relays with LO(2,0) towards node Z.

   If a unidirectional failure occurs on the working path W3 (not on the
   W1) in the direction from node F to node P at time one.  Although the
   resource preemption will fail, the basic PSC processing will be
   similarly.


6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.


7.  Security Considerations

   The generic security considerations for the data-plane of MPLS-TP are
   described in the security framework document
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-security-framework] together with the required
   mechanisms needed to address them.  The security considerations for
   the generic associated control channel are described in [RFC5586].
   The security considerations for protection and recovery aspects of
   MPLS-TP are addressed in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk].

   The extensions to the protocol described in this document are
   extensions to the protocol defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-linear-protection] [I-D.ezy-mpls-1ton-protection]
   and does not introduce any new security risks.
