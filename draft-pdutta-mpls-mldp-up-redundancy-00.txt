Abstract 

   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to-
   Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched 
   Paths. The existing specification for this functionality assumes that 
   a downstream LSR selects only one upstream LSR for a P2MP or MP2MP 
   LSP. A Make-Before-Break (MBB) procedure in mLdp base specification 
   [MLDP] for graceful upstream LSR change but that is not applicable 
   when the upstream LSR node fails. As IPTV deployments grow in number 
   and size, service providers are looking for solutions that minimize 
   the service disruption due to such failures. This document describes 
   a set of procedures that minimize packet loss when an upstream LSR 
   node fails. This document does not change any specifications of mLdp 
   protocol as defined in [MLDP] and so there are no inter-operability 
   requirements for the procedures described in this document.

 1. Introduction 

1.1. Problem Statement 

   The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions for setting up 
   Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and 
   Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs are specified in [mLdp]. This 
   set of extensions is generally known as "Multipoint LDP" (mLdp) and 
   this documents refer P2MP and MP2MP LSPs as "mLdp Tunnels", unless 
   specified otherwise.

Internet-Draft         mLdp Upstream Redundancy               July 2011 
    

   A node Z that wants to join an mLdp Tunnel determines the upstream 
   peer U which is Z's next-hop on the best path from Z to the root node 
   R of the mLdp tunnel. If there is more than one such LDP peer due to 
   Equal-Cost-Multi-Path (ECMP), only one of them is picked. As defined 
   in [MLDP] when there are several candidate upstream LSRs, the LSR Z 
   must select only one upstream LSR based on a localized selection 
   algorithm at node Z. 

   When the best path to reach the root changes, the mLdp tunnel may be 
   broken temporarily resulting in packet loss until the LSR Z re-
   converges to a new upstream LSR U'. A set of Make-Before-Break (MBB) 
   procedures is defined in [MLDP] for graceful transition to new 
   upstream LSR U' and thus minimize this traffic loss. However these 
   set of procedures are not applicable when upstream LSR U fails and 
   that results in loss of traffic till topology re-converges to new 
   upstream U' and Z completes set-up of new path towards the root. mLdp 
   tunnels carry loss sensitive traffic such as broadcast video so it is 
   very important to provide protection against such upstream node 
   failures. A router's IGP convergence time is generally on the order 
   of hundred's of milliseconds; the application traffic may be 
   sensitive to losses greater than tens of milliseconds till the local 
   LSR selects new upstream LSR and establishes the mLdp tunnel path 
   towards the root node.    

   Minimizing traffic loss requires a mechanism for the local LSR Z on 
   detection of failure to its immediate upstream U to rapidly invoke a 
   repair path, which is minimally affected by any subsequent re-
   convergence. This document describes a set of procedures to provide 
   protection against failure of upstream LSR by pre-establishing an 
   mLdp tunnel path to one or more secondary upstream LSRs. The 
   specification in this document leverage existing methodologies to 
   achieve upstream LSR failover protection without imposing 
   requirements on inter-operability or new protocol specification.

   Backup Upstream  : Redundant Upstream LSR chosen by a node to receive 
                      traffic on an mLdp tunnel on failure of its         
                      primary upstream.

 4. Upstream LSR Redundancy 

   Upstream LSR failure protection can be provided by taking advantage 
   of redundant topologies in service provider networks. A local LSR Z 
   selects two upstream LSRs - one primary LSR U and at least one backup 
   LSR U'. Label mappings L sent to U and L' sent to U shares the same 
   downstream next-hop label forwarding entries at Z. It needs to be 
   ensured that mLdp tunnel path along such secondary LSR U' is loop 
   free. Data packets are received by Z from both U and U' 
   simultaneously. Redundant packets received from U' are discarded by 
   Z. When Z detects a reachability failure to U then it switches its 
   upstream to the backup LSR U' and packets are immediately available 
   to forward out of each downstream next-hops. The amount of traffic 
   loss in such failovers is dependent on the detection methodologies 
   used by Z to detect failure of U. Details of such methodologies are 
   out of scope of this document.  

   This mode of upstream LSR protection causes traffic replication from 
   U' to Z which is dropped at Z. Note that such traffic replication 
   does may demand extra capacity although on failure of U, the mLdp 
   tunnel would have converged to U' anyway as a result of network 
   topology change. In service provider networks it is likely that such 
   redundant paths are kept disjoint from fate sharing. Redundant 
   replications may not require additional capacity in the network, but 
   may change replication distribution in upstream router U'.   

   This method is simple and is localize to individual routers along the 
   path from root to leaves of an mLdp tunnels. There arises no inter-
   operability requirements since there is no change in mLdp protocol 
   operation. End-to-end failure protection and recovery can be achieved 
   by such localized protection at every node.

 5. Backup Upstream LSR Selection  

   Backup upstream LSR protection is highly dependent on topology, that 
   is on the existence of two disjoint paths from LSR Z performing 
   protection to the root node R of the mLdp tunnel.  

   Upstream LSR Protection works best for following topologies:

   If the IGP installs ECMP paths at node Z to the Root Node R of the 
   mLdp tunnel, then Z selects one primary upstream LSR U based on 
   procedures in [MLDP]. If there are other LDP peers with remaining 
   paths in ECMP then Z can select one or more of those peers as backup 
   upstream LSR U' and label mappings are sent to those peers. Packets 
   received from backup upstream LSRs are dropped locally at Z till 
   primary upstream U fails. Since the packets from U' are already 
   arriving at Z so Z can switchover to U' immediately on detection of 
   failure to U. Further ECMP also means loop-free so on failure of U,

   this does not cause any loop in the path of the mLdp tunnel through 
   U' from root node R towards the leaves. 

    

5.2  Loop-Free-Alternate (LFA) 

   It is possible that in service provider network there are several 
   loop free alternate paths exist. [RFC5286] provides specification for 
   IP Fast Reroute with Loop-Free Alternates (LFA).

   In the absence of ECMP paths from Z towards root node R, IGPs may 
   compute LFA paths from Z towards the root node. Z would select LDP 
   peer on primary next-hop provided by IGP as primary upstream LSR U 
   and peers on LFA next-hops as candidate backup upstream LSRs U'. 
   Rapid upstream failure protection is achieved through use of pre-
   calculated backup next-hops that are loop-free and safe to use until 
   the distributed network convergence process completes. This simple 
   approach does not require any support from other routers. The extent 
   to which this goal can be met by this specification is dependent on

   the LFA topology of the network. Especially when networks does not 
   have ECMP, then backup stream LSR selection using LFA has significant 
   advantages. It is RECOMMENDED that LFA next-hops computed for this 
   purpose are "Node-Protecting", that is the backup LSR U' in turn must 
   not choose U as its primary upstream LSR. However without node 
   protection although upsteam node failure may not be protected, it 
   definitely provides link protection on failure of downstream link 
   from U to Z.  

 

 6. Fast Failover to Backup Upstream LSR 

   When node Z selects a backup upstream LSR and sends backup label 
   mapping L' for joining the mLdp tunnel path towards the root, it is 
   RECOMMENDED that Z installs L' into data plane with one exception : 
   L' MUST NOT be forwarding traffic to its downstream - it is kept in 
   "blocking mode". When Z detects failure on its primary upstream U, it 
   triggers switchover of traffic from primary upstream label L to L', 
   thus blocking L and unblocking L' in forwarding traffic to 
   downstream(s). This is important to avoid duplication of traffic to 
   downstream during failover. A single failover trigger may be 
   sufficient for fast switchover of traffic in all mLdp tunnels that 
   have selected U as primary upstream to their respective backup 
   upstream labels.  

   For some implementations it may not be possible to pre-install a 
   backup label L' into data plane in blocking mode. On primary upstream 
   failure, if L' is added before L is removed, there is a potential 
   risk of packet duplication, and/or the creation of transient data 
   plane forwarding loop. If L is removed before L' is added, packet 
   loss may result. For such implementations the RECOMMENDED procedure 
   is to remove L before adding L'.

   what is required in [MLDP].
