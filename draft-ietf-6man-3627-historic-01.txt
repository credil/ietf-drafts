                       RFC3627 to Historic status
                    draft-ietf-6man-3627-historic-01

Abstract

   This document moves RFC3627 (Use of /127 Prefix Length Between
   Routers Considered Harmful) to HISTORIC status to reflect the updated
   guidance contained in RFC6164 (Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-
   Router Links).  While a standards track document already supersedes
   an informational document and therefore RFC6164 is the appropriate
   guidance to follow when the two documents are in conflict, this links
   the two documents so that it is clearer that the IETF has updated
   guidance on the matter.

1.  Introduction

   This document moves RFC 3627 [RFC3627] to HISTORIC status in
   accordance with RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  It has been superseded by
   RFC 6164 [RFC6164].  While a standards track document already
   supersedes an informational document and therefore RFC6164 is the
   appropriate guidance to follow when the two documents are in
   conflict, this may not be clear to casual readers who are not
   completely familiar with the differences in IETF document types.
   This document adds the necessary link between the two documents so
   that those referring to RFC3627 for guidance will see that it has
   been obsoleted by updated guidance on the matter, thus hopefully
   eliminating any confusion that may be present.


2.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Brian Carpenter, Bob Hinden, and Ron Bonica for guidance on
   the matter, and to Pekka Savola and Miya Kohno and the other authors

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
