  Protocol to Access White Space database: Use cases and requirements
                draft-lei-paws-overview-usecases-00.txt

Abstract

   Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments.
   The spectrum is used for various purposes which include entertainment
   (eg. radio and television), communication (telephony and Internet
   access), military (radars etc.) and, navigation (satellite
   communication, GPS).  Portions of the radio spectrum that are unused
   or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white
   space".  TV White space refers to those unused channels, within the
   range allocated for TV transmission, that can be used without
   interfering with the primary purpose for which it is allocated.

   This document describes examples of how a radio system might operate
   using TV white space spectrum and associated requirements.  Not only
   does it describe the operation of a radio system, but also how the
   radio system including a white space database enables additional
   services.

1.  Introduction

   Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments.
   The spectrum is used for various purposes which include entertainment
   (eg. radio and television), communication (telephony and Internet
   access), military (radars etc.) and, navigation (satellite
   communication, GPS).  Additionally spectrum is allocated for use
   either on a license basis or for unlicensed use.  Television
   transmission until now has primarily been analog.  The switch to
   digital transmission has begun.  As a result the spectrum allocated
   for television transmission can now be more effectively used.  Unused
   channels and bands between channels can be used as long as they do
   not interfere with the primary service for which that channel is
   allocated.  While urban areas tend to have dense usage of spectrum
   and a number of TV channels, the same is not true in rural and semi-
   urban areas.  There can be a number of unused TV channels in such
   areas that can be used for other services.  The figure below shows TV
   white space within the lower UHF band:

   Regulatory entities in several countries including the US, Canada,
   UK, Finland to name a few are specifying the regulations for the use
   of TV white space.  The availability of TV white space opens up the
   potential for its use for various purposes.  Regulation may mandate
   its use for certain specific applications or services.

   This document describes an example of how a radio system might
   operate using TV white space spectrum.  Not only does it describe the
   operation of a radio system for providing Internet access at a hot
   spot or in a rural area, but also how the radio system including a
   white space database enables location based services.  The
   description is high level and generic, it is not meant to be specific
   to any particular radio technology.

   Master Device

       A device which queries the WS Database to find out the available
       operating channels.

   Slave Device

       A device which uses the spectrum made available by a master
       device.


3.  Use cases

   There are many potential use cases that could be considered for the
   TV white space spectrum.  Providing broadband internet access in hot
   spots, rural and underserved areas are examples.  Available channels
   may also be used to provide internet 'backhaul' for traditional Wi-Fi
   hot spots, or by towns and cities to monitor/control traffic lights
   or read utility meters.  Still other use cases include the ability to
   offload data traffic from another internet access network (e.g. 3G
   cellular network) or to deliver location based services.  Some of
   these use cases are described in the following sections.

3.1.  Indoor usage of TVWS

   At present, the indoor wireless coverage devices consist of Wi-Fi-
   like access points and micro cells, all of these utilize single
   segment of frequency, former at about 2.4GHz and the latter, for
   example, TD-LTE, at about 2.1GHz.  Due to the block of buildings and
   other obstruction and interfere, it may not be that optimistic when
   we consider the wireless receiving.  This use case takes the benefit
   of the excellent propagation performance of a radio network operating
   in TV White Space frequency bands i.e. 470-790 MHz to increase

   capacity and reduce same or unique frequency interfere coming from
   the macro cell.

   The figure below shows an example deployment of this scenario.

                       Graph 1 Indoor usage of TVWS

   The access point could be a WI-FI deviceGBP[not]and the micro cell is
   short range wireless coverage(e.g. in range of 0-50m) base station,
   both of them act as role of master device, query the internet
   connected database for available white space spectrum based on its
   geo-location, and provide TVWS access to user terminals indoor.  It's
   beyond our consideration in this draft when and how to switch between
   legally licensed TD-LTE frequency and available TVWS.

   The TVWS frequency spectrum has different propagation characteristics
   compared to higher frequency band, for instance, the propagation
   distance using TVWS may be several times longer than those in the
   higher range.  In this case, good penetration characteristic makes it
   difficult to lock the signal in the room, then difficult to localize
   and differentiate signals, and finally cause interferes among
   neighbor networks.  Suggestion to ease such headache would be:
   relative higher WS frequency; a frequency protection gap between
   neighbors; lower power output of AP/micro cell, it seems that only
   certain pico or femto cells be feasible here.

3.2.  TVWS based ad-hoc network

   When establishing an ad-hoc network, one node act as the primary
   device in charge of connection management, we can call it a virtual

   AP; other devices act as slave devices and connect themselves to this
   virtual AP, thus forming P2P ad-hoc network.  It provides us an
   informal but convenient way to share information with each other, and
   expand the wireless coverage by accepting one new device join in the
   ad-hoc network.  However, the coverage of a wireless device for
   example, WI-FI, in the room environment, normally shorter than 50m,
   so reliable wireless communication may not be available when device
   distance beyond this limit.  Introducing TVWS to ad-hoc network bring
   in at least two benefits: wider coverage owing to good propagation
   characteristics of TVWS; release frequencies previously occupied by
   ad-hoc and reduce interfere.

   The figure below shows an example deployment of this scenario.

   TVWS based ad-hoc network Establishment steps:


   1.  Device 1 acts as the primary device and power on, other 3 devices
       act as slave devices , they establish P2P connection to device 1
       individually, and finally forming a regular ad-hoc network.

   2.  Device 1 query the database for available TVWS based on the
       location and send the information to the entire ad-hoc network.

   3.  The 3 slave devices receive this information and start listening
       on TVWS frequency.

   An ad-hoc network operating on white space frequency band is

   available now.

   The connection with the White Space geo-location database service
   provider must be provided by at least one node (in this case, it is
   device 1) and may use other techniques than communication over white
   space frequency bands.  That's to say, we could connect the device 1
   to the internet with various techniques, such as wired Ethernet,
   wireless connection using regular licensed TD-LTE band, even another
   TVWS frequency.

   Referred to mobility consideration, the spectrum usage perceived by
   the network is changing, and therefore the update interval of the
   spectrum usage information needs to be much higher.

3.3.  TVWS based TD-LTE MBMS

   When performing broadcasting services, specific radio resources need
   to be reserved.  With more and more kinds of broadcast applications
   are introduced in, e.g., live radio/TV program broadcasting, the
   radio resources may be scarce.  We could turn to TVWS for help by
   transmitting broadcasting services on locally available white space
   frequency.  In this case, TD-LTE Multimedia Broadcast Service (MBMS)
   is taken into account.

   The figure below shows an example deployment of this scenario.

                     Graph 3 TVWS based MBMS in TD-LTE

   In the upper graph, BM-SC is short for "broadcast/multicast-service
   center",MCE (Multi-cell/multicast Coordination Entity) is a central
   control entity which is used for admission control and allocation of
   radio resource used by all the eNodeBs in the same MBSFN(Multimedia
   Broadcast multicast service Single Frequency Network) area.  MBSFN is
   a model, in this model, a group of base stations transmit same
   content with the same frequency at the same time.  The base station
   may be enhanced with the capability of sensing TVWS spectrums and
   reporting the sensing result to the MCE.

   In this case, TVWS frequency bands are only used to transmit MBMS
   service data; MBMS signaling is still carried by LTE bands.

   Simplified steps are as follows:


   1.  When BM-SC wants to start broadcast service in a MBSFN area, it
       sends a message including service specified Qos parameters to MCE
       which is in charge of this MBSFN area.

   2.  MCE is aware of load condition of the whole MBSFN area, so, if
       the radio resources are not sufficient in this area to meet the

       Qos requirements, MCE query the database to get the information
       of TVWS spectrum usage status and decides whether suitable TVWS
       frequency bands are available for transmitting broadcasting
       service in this area.

   3.  If there exists no available TVWS frequency bands in this MBSFN
       area, MCE would inform BM-SC that broadcast service is rejected;
       else, MCE would send a configuration command which includes
       allocated TVWS to all the eNodeBs in this area.

   4.  eNodeBs configure themselves and send configuration response
       command to MCE; then eNodeBs broadcast a message including
       allocated TVWS to UEs so as to inform them preparing to receive
       broadcast service on TVWS.

   1.  A master device MUST include, directly or indirectly, its antenna
       height in the query to the WS Database.

   2.  A master device MUST query the WS Database for the available
       channels at least once a day to verify that the operating
       channels continue to remain available.

   3.  A master device MUST determine its location with at least =/-50
       meters accuracy and MUST place that location into the query it
       makes to the WS Database.

   4.  A master device MAY indicate the accuracy by which it determined
       its location in the query to the WS Database.

   5.  A master device which changes its location during operation MUST
       query the WS Database for available operating channels each time
       it moves more than 100 meters from the location it previously
       made the query.

   6.  A master device MUST be able to receive channel availability
       updates from a WS Database.

   7.  A master device MUST be able to query the WS Database for channel
       availability information for multiple locations.

   8.  A master device MUST be able to query the WS Database for channel
       availability information for a specific area around its current
       location.

   9.  A master device MUST query the WS Database and include the FCC ID
       of the slave device in the query before allowing the slave device
       to use the available channel.

4.2.  Database

   1.  The WS Database MUST provide the available channel list when
       requested and MAY also provide time constraints for the channel
       list and maximum output power to the master device.

4.3.  Security

   1.  The protocol between the master device and the WS Database MUST
       support mutual authentication and authorization.

   2.  The protocol between the master device and the WS Database MUST
       support integrity and confidentiality protection.

   3.  The WS Database MUST support both username/password and digital
       certificates based authentication of the master device.

   4.  A master device MUST be capable to validate the digital
       certificate of the WS Database.

   5.  A master device MUST be capable to check the validity of the WS
       Database certificate and whether it has been revoked or not.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There have been no IANA considerations so far in this document.


6.  Security Considerations

   The messaging interface between the master and the database must be
   secure to ensure confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of the
   data exchanged between devices.  A master queries a database with
   information which identifies owner/operator of the device and also
   the location of the device.  Such information can reasonably
   considered to be sensitive information which must remain
   confidential.  A well-functioning white space network relies upon
   trusted devices exchanging trusted information, thus each participant
   in the protocol exchange must be authenticated.  A white space
   network must ensure the protection of the primary user of the radio
   spectrum, therefore the integrity of the message exchange must be
   ensured.

7.  Summary and Conclusion

   The document describes some examples of the role of the white space
   database in the operation of a radio network and also shows an
   examples of a services provided to the user of a TVWS device.  From
   these use cases requirements are determined.  These requirements are
   to be used as input to the definition of a Protocol to Access White
   Space database (PAWS).
