Abstract 
    
   This document describes a Service-Oriented Mechanism for Fault 
   Detection and Localization (SOMFDL). This mechanism brings up the 
   concepts of "Chord supplementary" and "QoS Trigger". By monitoring 
   the real-time QoS level of the forward path, network can launch the 
   mechanism when the QoS level cannot satisfy the requirement of 
   service transmission, so that fault detection and localization can be 
   realized. By designing related protocols, the manipuility of this 
   mechanism can be guaranteed. Utilizing this mechanism, network can 
   accomplish fault detection and localization in a time scale of 
   milliseconds with a few datagram sent.

1. Introduction 
    
   With the development of telecommunication technology as well as the 
   rise of user's expectation to QoS, service has become the main 
   driving force which leads the development of telecommunication 
   network. In this context, new services, such as VoIP, IPTV and 3G 
   services, emerge in endlessly. However, some suddens may come out 
   when service data is being transmitted, which result in a serious 
   decline of network performance, so that the QoS of services cannot be 
   guaranteed, that is service fault. Service fault includes 
   interruption of services and congestion of services. The former is 
   usually caused by wrong configuration of some software or hardware 
   parameters, meanwhile, the latter is mainly caused by inappropriate 
   routing policy. 
    
   It is necessary to import a service-oriented fault detection and 
   localization mechanism into IP network. In this way, the reliability 
   of service data transmitting can be ensured. Moreover, it can help to 
   improve the survivability of network and provide a good capacity of 
   fault detection and localization. 
    
   Although the existed methods of fault detection, such as Slow-Hello 
   mechanism and BFD mechanism, are widely applied, they still cannot 
   finish fault detection within a second. Meanwhile, these mechanisms 
   will result in network jitter. 
    
   The existed method of fault localization, for example, the Loop Back 
   mechanism, cannot synthesize the localization information together, 
   which means that with these methods, network cannot locate the fault 
   accurately in a node, or a link. What's more, all of the existed 
   fault detection and localization methods are not service-oriented, 
   they cannot satisfy the needs of the new service control network. 
    
   Aiming at these problems, we come up with the Service-Oriented 
   Mechanism for Fault Detection and Localization. In this mechanism, 
   new techniques such as "Chord Supplementary" and "QoS Trigger" are 
   applied, which makes this mechanism have the advantages listed below. 
    
    
    
   a. This mechanism can realize service oriented fault detection and 
     localization. 
      
   b. This mechanism can be triggered when the network is in error,which

                                 SOMFDL                  September 2011 
 
 
     reduces the total number of the datagram, that means the 
     possibility of network jitter will be lower. 
      
   c. This mechanism can combine source node and destination node in the 
     service forwarding path together, so that they can work 
     collaboratively, share the fault localization information, and 
     locate the fault accurately. 
    
   This mechanism can shorten the time scale of fault detection and 
   localization to milliseconds. 
    
    
1.1 Terminology 
    
   This document assumes the terminology defined in [RFC2753]. For 
   convenience, the definition of a few key terms is repeated here: 
    
   SOMFDL: The abbreviation of the mechanism, which is short for 
   Service-Oriented Mechanism for Fault Detection and Localization. 
    
   Chord Supplementary: Utilizing the nodes excluded in service 
   forwarding path to guarantee the connectivity between source node and 
   destination node. 
    
   QoS Trigger:As soon as destination node has known the decline of QoS, 
   it will generate a QoS trigger datagram, and send it to source node 
   through the "Chord". This starting method can lower the total number 
   of datagram, and reduce the network jitter. 
    
   Explicit Routing: According to MPLS, we can obtain a explicit routing 
   which means the service provider (the source node) has been aware of 
   the information of all the nodes on the service forwarding path. All 
   of the packets for a single service will be transmitted in this 
   certain path. 
    
    
2. Application Scenarios 
    
   From the development trend of network, a variety of services are 
   developing in the direction of IP-based, at the same time, most of 
   the new services are based on IP technology. In this article, these 
   new trends are fully taken into consideration, then the service 
   oriented fault detection and localization mechanism is brought up. 
   This mechanism can be applied in various IP-based networks, including 
   traditional IP networks, MPLS networks and new pattern Overlay 
   networks, and so on.

   In these network environments, this mechanism can reduce the expend 
   of detecting and locating faults, diagnose the fault types accurately 
   with lower cost, estimate the cause of service faults, and locate the 
   faults in specific sites. In a word, this mechanism can satisfy the 
   fault detection and localization requirements of different kinds of 
   services. 
    
    
3. Specific Operation Process 
    
   The working process of SOMFDL includes several procedures listed 
   below: 
    
   a. QoS Trigger:In this section,network will construct the end-to-     
      end service forwarding path and finish chord supplementary. Then, 
      destination node will take charge of monitoring the real-time QoS. 
      As soon as the QoS goes down, destination node will inform this 
      situation of source node, and trigger the mechanism. 
    
   b. Fault Index: In this section, source node will search the EndNode 
      along downstream path, meanwhile, destination node will do the 
      same thing along upstream path. 
     
   c. Fault Confirm: In Fault Index section, the EndNodes are found out. 
      Now each EndNode will send confirm datagram to the unreachable 
      neighbor node periodically so as to estimate what kind of fault 
      has happened, congestion or interrupt. 
     
   d. Fault Alarm: In this section, each EndNode will generate 
      congestion or interrupt alarm datagram,and send it to source node. 
     
   e. Fault Localization: In this section, each EndeNode will generate 
      fault localization datagram and send it to source node. Then, 
      source node will analyze the datagrams and find out the cause and 
      location of service fault. 
     
   Next, the specific implemention process of SOMFDL will be described. 
    
    
3.1 QoS Trigger 
    
   When source node receives the request of a service from destination 
   node, it will synthesize the constraint condition of network and 
   expected QoS level of the service together, and find the best service 
   forwarding path from source node to destination node, at the same 
   time, the chord between source node and destination node will be 
   supplemented. Then, destination node will be in charge of monitoring 
   the real-time QoS level of the service. As soon as QoS falls in a 
 
 
Li, Zhao, Wang           Expires - March 2012                 [Page 5] 
                                 SOMFDL                  September 2011 
 
 
   sudden, destination node will immediately generate QoS Trigger 
   datagram, and send it to source node through the chord. When source 
   node receives the QoS Trigger datagram, the mechanism will be 
   triggered. 
                          
   The type of services mentioned above is pretty various, including 
   common Internet services, IPTV, VoIP, online games, 3G services, and 
   so on. Although the techniques applied to build up the best 
   forwarding path for different services vary, it isn`t the main point 
   we focus in this mechanism. 
    
   The indexes of service QoS are mainly consisted of bandwidth, delay, 
   jitter (variation of delay) and packet loss rate. 
   Monitoring the real-time QoS level is usually conducted in this way: 
   firstly, source node divides service data into different levels.Then, 
   using the last 6 bits of the ToS field in IPv4/IPv6 header, 64 
   different DSCP values can be generated, which can be utilized to mark 
   priority of different service data. If all nodes in the network 
   topology are configured to carry out data classification based on the 
   DSCP tag, then these nodes can easily identify the service data 
   packet from source node, and monitor the real-time QoS level of 
   marked service data. For example, when several end-to-end service 
   forwarding paths in the network coincide in a node (or a link), the 
   public node (or the two nodes connected by the public link) can 
   successfully distinguish different service forwarding paths by 
   analyzing the DSCP value, source IP address and destination IP 
   address in the service data packets. Thus, the QoS of different 
   services can be monitored in time. 
    
   QoS diagnosis information is carried by QoS Trigger datagram. The 
   information includes one or more the sudden falling QoS indexes, such 
   as the sudden rising packet loss rate. 
    
   The process of chord supplementary: After source node has synthesized 
   the constraint condition of network and expected QoS level of the 
   service, the best service forwarding path will be built up, it can be 
   donated by Path. All paths that can transmit data between source node 
   and destination node constitute aggregate A. Besides Path, all others 
   belonging to A are called chord, it can be donated by B. The paths in 
   B may coincide to some extent. Path is an element of A, and B is a 
   subset of A.  
    
   Through the chord B, source node can send Multi_hop Alive datagram 
   periodically, as long as source node can receive response datagram 
   from the opposite end, the connectivity between source node and 
   destination node is good. Here, the mechanism mainly focuses on the 
   connectivity of the chord, as for the intermediate nodes passed by 
   the datagram, not within the scope of our attention. Since B is an 
   aggregate which consists of several connected paths between source 
 
 
Li, Zhao, Wang           Expires - March 2012                 [Page 6] 
                                 SOMFDL                  September 2011 
 
 
   node and destination node, the possibility that all paths break down 
   is absolutely low. So, the connectivity of chord can be well 
   guaranteed. 
    
3.2 Fault Index 
    
   In this section, source node generates Fault Index datagram, and 
   sends it downstream to each node hop-by-hop. By this, the EndNode on 
   the forwarding path can be found out. When the downstream node 
   receives Fault Index datagram, it will reply a response datagram to 
   the upstream node. At the same time, it will add its healthy 
   information into Fault Index datagram and send it to the next hop. 
   This process will not stop until one node cannot receive a response 
   datagram from the next hop within index time. Meanwhile, destination 
   node also generates a Fault Index datagram, and sends it upstream to 
   each node hop-by-hop, specific operation is the same as source node 
   does. 
    
   Source node and destination node both generate Fault Index datagram, 
   and send them to the direction of fault scenario through service 
   forwarding path and its inverse path. 
    
   The node which doesn`t receive the response datagram is the last node 
   that can be reached by index datagram, it is called (Upstream or 
   Downstream) Reachable EndNode. 
    
   The index time is (1+0.1*N)*t. Here, t is the interval from the time 
   when a node sends its neighbor index datagram to the time when it 
   receives the response datagram from its neighbor node. N is an 
   arbitrary integer equal or greater than zero, the selection of N will 
   take the QoS diagnosis information in QoS Trigger datagram into 
   consideration. 
    
3.3 Fault Confirm 
    
   In this section, the Upstream Reachable EndNode generates Fault 
   Confirm datagram, and sends it to its unreachable next hop 
   periodically.If the next hop node successfully receives the datagram, 
   it will immediately reply with a response datagram. If the Reachable 
   EndNode can get arbitrary response datagram, it means that the 
   decline of QoS is caused by service congestion, the fault type is 
   service congestion. On the contrary, if the Reachable EndNode doesn`t 
   receive any response datadram, it means that service interrupt leads 
   to the decline of QoS,the fault type is service interrupt. Similarly, 
   the Downstream Reachable EndNode implements this procedure in the 
   same way. 
    


 
 
Li, Zhao, Wang           Expires - March 2012                 [Page 7] 
                                 SOMFDL                  September 2011 
 
 
   The confirm time is N*t. The selection of N will take expected QoS 
   level of this kind of service into consideration. 
    
   The cause of service congestion can be various, such as several links 
   send datagrams to a single link at the same time, high speed link 
   transmits data to low speed link, non-critical services seize 
   critical services, services overflow, and so on. 
    
   The cause of service interrupt can be node fault or link fault. 
    
   After above mentioned section, the name of Reachable EndNodes will be 
   changed to Fault Localization Nodes. They locates at both sides of 
   the fault location, just next to the fault location. The one which 
   locates upstream is called Upstream Fault Localization Node, and the 
   other is named Downstream Fault Localization Node. 
    
3.4 Fault Alarm 
    
   Upstream Fault Localization Node generates Fault Alarm datagram and 
   sends it to source node, the information of service congestion or 
   interrupt is contained in the datagram. When source node receives the 
   Fault Alarm datagram from Upstream Fault Localization Node, it can be 
   aware of the fault type. In this section, Downstream Localization 
   Node doesn`t do anything. 
    
3.5 Fault Localization 
    
   After fault type is found out, Upstream and Downstream Fault 
   Localization Nodes both generate Fault Localization datagram and send 
   them to source node. During this process, the normal nodes passed by 
   the datagram will add their healthy information to the localization 
   datagram. After source node receives Fault Localization datagrams 
   from two directions, it will compute and estimate the place where the 
   fault happens. 
    
   The localization datagram generated by Upstream Localization Node 
   will be sent to source node through the inverse path of service 
   forwarding path. While, the one generated by Downstream Localization 
   Node will be sent to destination node through service forwarding 
   path, and then , destination node will send it to source node 
   through the chord. 
    
   Further, this technical proposal includes: 
    

 
 
Li, Zhao, Wang           Expires - March 2012                 [Page 8] 
                                 SOMFDL                  September 2011 
 
 
   Source node will compare the localization information (mainly the 
   healthy information of nodes) with the explicit routing information. 
   If the localization information lacks the number of a node, it means 
   the service fault happens at the node.If the information is integral, 
   it means the link between Upstream and Downstream Localization Node 
   is in the state of congestion or interrupt. That is, if the Upstream 
   and Downstream Localization Nodes are neighbor nodes, the fault must 
   be in the link between them. However, if the two localization nodes 
   are not neighbors, the fault must be caused by the node between them. 
   Source node can xor the localization information with the explicit 
   routing, and gains the ID of fault node. 
    
    
4. Design of Datagram 
    
   The format of the datagram is shown as the figure below.

   The function of each field is listed below. 
    
   Vers field, whose full name is Version. This field is used to 
   indicate the version of the datagram,its length is 3bit. For example, 
   if the datagram is the first version, the field will be set to 001. 
    
   M field, whose full name is Multi-Hop-Alive. The length of this field 
   is 1bit. When source node start to transmit data to destination node, 
   it will be set to 1, representing Multi_hop Alive datagram. 
    
   Q field, whose full name is QoS Trigger. The length of this field is 
   1bit. When destination node discovers a sudden fall of QoS, the field 
   will be set to 1, representing QoS Trigger datagram. That means the 
   mechanism has been in the section of QoS Trigger. 
    
   S field, whose full name is Search. The length of this field is 1bit. 
   When source node receive QoS Trigger message from destination node,

   it will be set to 1, representing Fault Index datagram. That means 
   the mechanism has been in the section of Fault Index. 
    
   C field, whose full name is Confirm.The length of this field is 1bit. 
   When the Reachable EndNodes are found, this field will be set to 1, 
   representing Fault Confirm datagram. That means the mechanism has 
   been in the section of Fault Confirm. 
    
   A field, whose full name is Alarm. The length of this field is 1bit. 
   When fault type is found out, this field will be set to 1, 
   representing Fault Alarm datagram. That means the mechanism has been 
   in the section of Fault Alarm, Upstream Fault Localization Node will 
   send alarm to source node, so that source node will be informed of 
   the fault type. 
    
   L field, whose full name is Location. The length of this field is 
   1bit. When the fault type has been found out, this field will be set 
   to 1, representing Fault Localization datagram. That means the 
   mechanism has been in the section of Fault Localization. 
    
   E field, whose full name is Echo. The length of this field is 1bit. 
   When response datagram is needed, this field will be set to 1. On the 
   contrary, this field will be set to 0. 
    
   QD field, whose full name is Alarm Diagnostic. The length of this 
   field is 4bit, from the low order to the high order, the bit 
   successively presents delay, packet loss rate, jitter and bandwidth. 
   For example, 0001 represents delay, 0010 represents packet loss rate 
   and 0111 represents the performances of delay, packet loss rate and 
   jitter go down at the same time. One point must be noticed, that this 
   field must be used coordinate with Q field to indicate which 
   performance has fall. 
    
   C/I field, whose full name is Service Congestion/Interruption. The 
   length of this field is 2bit. This field also needs to be used with Q 
   field to describe the fault type. When the field is set to 01, it 
   means the fault type is service congestion. When the field is set to 
   10, it means the fault type is service interrupt. Other condition 
   means service has no fault. 
    
   N field, whose length is 8bit. If this field is used together with S 
   field, it can select fault confirm time,representing a multiple of t. 
   If this field is used together with C field, it can select fault 
   index time, representing a multiple of 0.1*t. 
    
   Length field, whose length is 8bit, is set to indicate the length of 
   fault detection and localization datagram.

   ID field, whose full name is Session Identification Code. The length 
   of this field is 32bit. This field is the only non-zero value sent by 
   the source, used to indicate different sessions. 
    
   ETI field, whose full name is Echo Receive Time Interval. The length 
   of this field is 32bit. This field represents the time interval from 
   the time when a node sends its neighbor index datagram to the time 
   when it receives the response datagram from its neighbor node. 
    
   LDI field, whose full name is Location Diagnostic Information. The 
   length of this field is 32bit. This field is used to store the ID of 
   Upstream and Downstream Localization Node, as well as the healthy 
   information of the nodes the datagrams pass by. 
    
   SDP field, whose full name is Service Data Patch. This field is used 
   to store service data when sending index and confirm datagram. The 
   length of this field varies according to different services. 
    
   Reserve field, this field is reserved to future use, whose length is 
   32bit. 
    
    
Security Considerations 
    
   As SOMFDL can be used in IP-based networks, especially MPLS networks, 
   it may be tied into the stability of the network infrastructure (such 
   as routing protocols). However, the effects of an attack on a SOMFDL 
   session will not be so serious as that on a BFD session, for the a 
   SOMFDL session is triggered to start, not the same as BFD, which 
   sends detecting datagrams all the time. 
    
   Also, the concept of Chord supplementary has made the mechanism more 
   reliable. The "Chord" is a aggregate, it is hard for the attacks to 
   damage all the extra links between source and destination node. That 
   is, the connectivity of the detecting path can be guaranteed, the 
   attack vulnerability will be reduced to a low level. 
    
    
IANA Considerations 
    
   The document defines the format of the datagram for SOMFDL. In the 
   packet, different fields should be administered by IANA. The fields 
   are designed to make the mechanism work better. 
    
   The field entitled "M" is to indicate the connectivity of the chord. 
    
   The fields of "Q" "S" "A" "C" "L" and "E" are assigned to represent 
   different types of datagram sent by the network elements in different 
   working sections of SOMFDL.

   The "QD" field is the indicator of QoS parameters. 
    
   The "C\I" field is designed here just to indicate different fault 
   types. It is the mark which shows the fault is congestion or 
   interrupt. 
    
   The "ID" field is set to distinguish different sessions of different 
   types of services. And the "ETI" field comes out to show the 
   coefficient of time interval which can control the length of each 
   working section of SOMFDL. 
    
   The "LDI" field is set to store the localization information added by 
   the network nodes on the service forwarding path. When source node 
   gains the entire information from "LDI" field, it will compute to 
   find out the place where the fault happens. 
    
   Also, we have the "Reserve" field which could be used in 
   authentication and other necessary activities.
