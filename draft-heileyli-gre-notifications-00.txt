Abstract

   GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) specifies a protocol for the
   encapsulation of an arbitrary protocol over another arbitrary network
   layer protocol.

   This document describes extensions to manage multiple GRE tunnels
   over multiple access lines to one home network with the purpose to
   present a novel architecture using Hybrid Access (HA) networks.  HA
   is designed to bundle multiple access technologies, e.g. fixed access
   and wireless access to one Internet connection.  This enables higher
   bandwidth for end customers.  The document describes the Hybrid
   Access network architecture and th extensions for GRE which are
   necessary to implement the HA architecture.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a new GRE extension which allows the
   operators to have home networks that consist of at least two IP
   access lines to the same location from one network gateway.  GRE
   tunnels are used to combine the multiple access lines together to one
   Internet connection.  The combination from e.g. a wireless access
   (LTE) and a fixed line (DSL) access enables new use cases:.

   1.  Bandwidth on demand, if fixed line is full, bandwidth of mobile
       access is added on demand

   2.  Seamless handover, if one access lines fails the service can
       still be provided without interruption

   3.  Application dependent transport of different combined or non-
       combined access lines to one home network location

   This extension contains signaling information to manage those
   multiple GRE connections over the multiple access lines.  The lines
   can have different weight and qualities and have to be merged to one
   authorized connection.  Therefore a signaling is needed for the
   following cases:

   1.  Signaling of the IP addresses of the access lines and IP
       addressed of the combination GRE tunnels

   2.  Signaling of the weight of one access line, a cheaper access line
       should be used

   3.  Signaling of keep alive to decide which GRE tunnels are active
       and can be used

   4.  Signaling of bypass traffic amount which should be bypassed from
       the tunnels

   5.  Signalling of deny and allowed messages

2.  Use Cases

   Recently, the existing network status can bringing changes to the
   operator's network: Higher bandwidth requirement and current limited
   usage of existing networks(e.g.wireless network: LTE, etc).  There is
   a strong interest to integrate the existing network resource as a
   single Internet connection for end customers.  The resulting network
   is called a Hybrid Access (HA) network.  The HA network can be
   controlled by the user's Customer Premise Equipment (CPE).  The
   connectivity in HA is being implemented by using a tunnel mechanism
   on top of the physical infrastructure.

   This document described the HA architecture by illustrating DSL and
   LTE bundled.  Nevertheless the solution is not limited to those
   technologies and can be easily applied to other scenarios.  This
   document describes the base HA network architecture, while solution
   approach with extensions of GRE protocol [RFC2890] will realize HA
   network architecture.

   With HA many deficiencies in the current operator's network,
   following use cases are enabled.

   1. Bandwidth On Demand

   Typically end customers are only connected using a single link (e.g.
   fixed or wireless) to the network of a service provider.  If the
   required bandwidth exceeds the bandwidth provided by the link usually
   the link needs to be upgraded.  However, using the current network
   deployment model such an upgrade is not always economically feasible.
   A different approach is needed.

   In this model end customer are connected over one standard access
   line (e.g.fixed line: DSL, Cable, ...) primarily to the operator's
   service.  In addition there are one or more another connections over
   the different access technologies, (e.g. wireless line: LTE).  If the
   traffic exceeds the bandwidth of the primary access line the bundled
   connections can provide a higher bandwidth to the end customer.

   2. Seamless Handover

   In HA network, the customer has a CPE connection through the access
   network (e.g.fixed line: DSL, Cable, ...).  The CPE also provides a
   back-up WAN connection through another network (e.g. wireless line:
   LTE), when the fixed line is unavailable.

   The customer is using Internet service via fixed WAN connection.
   When the fixed connection gets disconnected unexpectedly, the ongoing
   service is automatically switched to the backup connection.  The
   Internet service is not interrupted by this event and continues
   seamlessly by end-user.

3.  Conventions and Terminology

3.1.  Terminology

   Bonding Tunnel:  The bundling tunnel of both fixed access tunnel and
      wireless access tunnel.  The bonding tunnel in HA is the
      connection on top of the physical infrastructure, terminated
      between CPE and HAAP.

   Tunnel Transit IP:  The outer IP of a GRE encapsulation.

   DSL Tunnel:  The GRE tunnel between CPE DSL WAN and HAAP.  The tunnel
      transit IP is IP address of CPE DSL WAN interface and HAAP
      address.  It is one subset tunnel of bonding tunnel.

   Dynamic GRE:  The dynamic stateful GRE tunnel.

   Customer Premise Equipment  (CPE):  A device that connects multiple
      terminals to provide connectivity to the service providers
      network.

   Hybrid Access (HA):  Hybrid Access (HA) is the bundling of two or
      more access line over different technologies (e.g. DSL and LTE) to
      one Internet connection for end customers.

   Hybrid Access Aggregation Point (HAAP):  The HAAP which acts as a
      service termination and a service creation implements bonding
      mechanism and sets up a high speed Internet dual stack IP
      connection with CPE on top of two or more different access
      technologies.

   HA IP:  The inner IP of a GRE encapsulation.  This IP is assigned by
      HAAP to CPE; this is the IP for the Internet communication.
      Sometimes it is called tunnel IP in this document.

   LTE Tunnel:  The GRE tunnel between CPE LTE WAN and HAAP.  The tunnel
      transit IP is IP address of CPE LTE WAN interface and HAAP
      address.  It is one subset tunnel of bonding tunnel.

4.  Hybrid Access Network Architecture

   The basic idea of Hybrid Access is the bundling of the DSL and LTE
   access technologies.  Figure 1 illustrates one example of Hybrid
   Access network.

   In the fixed network, users are served fixed services by the Access
   Node (AN) and Service Node (e.g. Broadband Network Gateway (BNG)).
   In the wireless network, cellular sites are connected to the mobile
   core network using mobile backhaul network and EPC core network.  The
   new approach of Hybrid should take into consideration the fact that
   operators introduces additional network bandwidth resource with
   limited usage to users.

   In the HA architecture, on the client site, CPE is used to implement
   the bonding mechanism for customers.  On the network side, a device
   named as Hybrid Access Aggregation Point (HAAP) MUST be deployed.
   The HAAP which acts as a service termination and a service creation
   implements bonding mechanism and sets up a higher speed Internet dual
   stack IP connection with the CPE on top of both access technologies
   a.k.a., DSL and LTE.  The HA connection between the end user's CPE
   and the HAAP could be done by using the tunnel mechanism on top of
   the physical infrastructure.  This document describes the extensions
   for dynamic GRE which are necessary.

   The bonding tunnel between CPE and HAAP carries best effort traffic
   going to and coming from the public Internet.  Particularly, based on
   the operator's requirement, it is possible that not all traffic from
   the home network is routed into the bonding tunnel in order to ensure
   that existing services are not influenced by using HA.  Certain
   traffic such as VoIP, IPTV traffic depending on its destination or
   QoS markings, needs to be routed via the fixed line interface or via
   the wireless interface instead to be routed into the bonding tunnel
   between CPE and HAAP.  The CPE should implement an mechanism which
   can be used to specify exceptions (traffic which should not be routed
   into the tunnel).  This mechanisms is out of scope of this document.

5.  Solution Approach Overview

   The bonding tunnel behavior is accomplished by implementing dynamic
   subset tunnels setup and bonding them together during the procedure.
   This section identifies the HA solution approaches that operators can
   leverage for deploying HA technologies, which is dynamic Generic
   Routing Encapsulation (GRE).

5.1.  Dynamic GRE Definition

   The dynamic GRE protocol is specified for encapsulation of the user
   traffic over multiple arbitrary network layer via bundling mechanism
   on CPE and HAAP.  This section describes dynamic GRE protocol.

   The dynamic GRE protocol transport layer carries GRE encapsulated
   Control messages, and GRE encapsulated Data messages.  GRE Data
   messages encapsulate forwarded user frames.  GRE Control messages are
   management messages exchanged between a CPE and a HAAP in HA
   architecture.  The format of GRE protocol Control are defined in
   section 7.

   The dynamic GRE protocol begins with a base access phase.  CPE gets
   DSL WAN interface IP address through PPPoE from service node (e.g.,
   BNG) or DHCP and LTE WAN interface IP address through Packet Data
   Protocol (PDP)[TS23.401] from PGW.  Additionally, CPE obtains HAAP
   address for tunnel establishment.  From the base access phase, a CPE
   discoveries the HAAP with which to establish the tunnels for HA.

   Once the base access have be completed, GRE Request is initiated by
   CPE in order to begin bonding tunnels setup phase between CPE and
   HAAP.  CPE setups the authorized LTE GRE tunnel before DSL GRE tunnel
   by sending GRE Request control messages via LTE WAN interface to
   HAAP.  After, CPE obtains HA IP address from HAAP through DHCP over
   LTE GRE tunnel.  Subsequently, authorized DSL GRE tunnel is
   established.  During these exchanges, the CPE may receive some
   information in order to enable both tunnel bundled.  GRE Accept/Deny
   identifies that GRE tunnel setup request is accepted/rejected.

   When the CPE and HAAP have completed the bonding tunnels setup
   exchange, the customers have the single service connection through
   both access technologies infrastructure.  Particularly,the specific
   traffic will send through the bonding tunnels and thus encapsulated
   by GRE.  As long as the primary connection (e.g., DSL) is sufficient,
   traffic goes through the DSL GRE tunnel only.  If traffic exceeds the
   bandwidth, traffic overflows to the LTE GRE tunnel.

   The dynamic GRE also provides commands exchange between CPE and HAAP
   for HA management.  These may be included in GRE Notify message for

   tunnel status/information changing between CPE and HAAP.  These may
   include the bypass traffic amount which should be bypassed from the
   bonding tunnels.

   The dynamic GRE protocol provides for a keep-alive feature that
   preserves the communication channel between the CPE and HAAP.  If the
   tunnels fail to appear alive, the CPE will try to re-establish it.
   For example, if the DSL tunnel cannot be re-established, HA traffic
   will still run through the LTE tunnel only.  If the LTE tunnel cannot
   be re-established, new Internet sessions will be established over
   native DSL.  The DSL tunnel will be finally torn down after a period
   without service interruption.

   For maintenance reasons, the GRE Tear Down message also can be used
   by CPE and HAAP to complete the HA architecture in out of service
   scenario.

5.2.  Bonding Tunnel Establishement Overview

   This section describes the bonding tunnel establishment process
   message exchanges between CPE and HAAP.  The annotated ladder diagram
   shows the CPE on the left, the HAAP on the right.  The dynamic GRE
   state mechanism is defined in detail in Section 6.  Note that in the
   Authentication step, the authentication required certain messages are
   aggregated into a single step, which is denoted via an asterisk line
   in Figure 2

                    Figure 2: GRE Tunnel Establishment

   At the end of the illustrated GRE control messages exchange, the
   bonding tunnel between CPE and HAAP is setup completely by binding
   LTE Tunnel and DSL Tunnel with same session ID, defined in
   Section 7.2.

   After, the CPE and HAAP are securely exchanging GRE Control messages
   for tunnel keepalive (GRE Hello) and management (GRE Notify).

   The GRE Notify message is used to inform status/information changing
   information between CPE and HAAP.  A notify acknowledgement (ACK) and
   retransmission mechanism can be used to provide certain level
   reliable transport capability.  When receiving end receives a notify
   packet, it will send back a GRE notify packet without any
   attributions appended to the sending end immediately as
   acknowledgement for the notify packet.  When sending end doesn't
   receive the notify ACK message in after a specific seconds, sending
   end treats it as lost of notify message and will retransmit the
   notify message.

   When sending end not receiving the notify ACK for a certain notify
   message for continually specific times, sending end treats it as
   sending failure and tunnel failure also, sending end will tear down
   the GRE tunnel which sent the notify message.  If the CPE is the
   sending end, the CPE will tear down the tunnel over which the notify
   packet was send, and try to re-establish the tunnel.  If HAAP is the
   sending end, the HAAP will tear down the corresponding GRE tunnel and
   wait for CPE to reestablish it.

   Tunnel Type (T) (1 bit)

   It indicates this control message for the type of the subset tunnel
   in HA.  For example, if the Tunnel Type (T) bit is set to 1, then
   this control message is for the DSL tunnel shown in Figure 5.
   Otherwise it indicates that this is for the LTE tunnel shown in
   Figure 5.

   Attribute Type (1 octet)

   The Attribute Type indicates the type of the appended attribution in
   the control message.  The attribute value pair is defined in
   Section 7.2.

   Attribute Length (2 octets)

   The Attribute Length field indicates the length of the attribute by
   byte.

   Attribute Value (variable)

   The Attribute Value field includes the value of the attribute.

7.2.  Dynamic GRE Protocol Messages Attributes

   This section defines the attributions that are included in dynamic
   GRE protocol control messages.  Attributions are used to carry
   information needed during bonding tunnel setup and management
   procedure.  Every attribution is identified by the Type, Length,
   Value field.  All of the message attributions in this document use
   the same format, shown as below in Figure 6.

   o  Session ID

   This is 32 bits value is generated by HAAP, and unified within a
   HAAP, to identify a certain subscriber.  This value is using to
   binding the DSL tunnel and LTE tunnel together for individual HA
   user.  HAAP generates a session ID for a HA user's and sends this
   value to CPE via LTE GRE setup accept, then CPE carries this value in
   the DSL GRE setup request, defined in section 4.2.  With this
   information, HAAP binds the DSL tunnel and LTE tunnel together, then
   bonding GRE tunnel is achieved accordingly.  When LTE recovery from
   failure with DSL tunnel exists, the re-establish LTE tunnel request
   need carry the Session ID attribute.

   Type: 4 for Session ID

   Length: 4 Octets

   Value: 32 bits value generated by HAAP.

   o  Bypass Traffic Rate

   This attribute is used to notify HAAP of the downstream bypass
   traffic on CPE via DSL Notify control message from CPE.  HAAP will
   calculate the available DSL bandwidth for DSL GRE tunnel based on
   this information.  CPE and HAAP can decide the bypass traffic amount
   which should be bypassed from the combination tunnels.  The unit of
   this value is kbps.

   Type: 6 for Bypass traffic rate

   Length: 4 Octets

   Value: Downstream bypass traffic on CPE.

   o  Hello Interval

   This is the configuration which is assigned to the CPE by the HAAP.
   Configure the Hello signaling checking period on CPE from HAAP.  The
   unit of this value is second.  This attribution is carried in GRE
   Setup Accept control message for LTE tunnel.

   Type: 14 for Hello Interval

   Length: 4 Octets

   Value: Hello Interval

8.  Overflow Bonding Operations

   In HA network, the user traffic can be transferred to wireless access
   (Overflow tunnel) when the fixed line (Primary tunnel) bandwidth is
   not any more sufficient.

   There are two types of overflow bonding mechanisms, packet-based
   balancing and stream-based balancing.  Balancing per stream can
   require the DSL bandwidth threshold configuration.  The steam only
   runs over the DSL or LTE link.  Balancing of per packet will use DSL
   bandwidth as soon as DSL bandwidth is not full.  It is possible that
   the same stream can run the different DSL and LTE link at the same
   time.  In HA network, packet-based balancing is proposed for
   efficiency.

   The packet-based overflow balancing is based on the Single Rate Three
   Color Marker (srTCM) and Two Rate Three Color Marker (trTCM) which is
   defined in[RFC2697] and [RFC2698].The packet is marked if the packet
   is overflowed or not.  The CIR (Committed Information Rate) is equal
   to the DSL bandwidth minus several layers' overhead.  The CBS
   (Committed Burst Size) provides the burst capability which can help
   TCP achieve the committed bandwidth.  This mechanism is used on both
   HAAP for downstream overflow bonding and CPE for upstream overflow
   bonding.

   Then the colored based policy routing is executed for packet-based
   balancing, user's packet will be routed into the corresponding tunnel
   based on color.  For example,Yellow color packet will be routed to
   LTE GRE tunnel; green color packet will be routed into DSL GRE
   tunnel.  At this stage, the GRE IP header will be added.

   Additionally, during the packet-based balancing, reorder mechanism
   are need for both HA downstream and upstream.  On the downstream, the
   packets encapsulated in GRE will come from DSL GRE tunnel and/or LTE
   GRE tunnel.  The packets will be sent to a buffer for reordering.  If
   the GRE sequence number is not continuous, the packets will be
   buffered until the missing sequence packet has arrived or the
   buffering time has expired.  After reordering, the GRE header will be
   removed and the packet will be sent to the ordinary CPE processing.
   Upstream direction reordering is performed on HAAP using the same
   mechanism as downstream.

   In order to ensure that existing services are not influenced by using
   HA, it is possible that certain traffic does not be routed through
   the tunnel, but directly over the corresponding interfaces.  This is
   necessary in case the tunnel and the HAAP are not supporting QoS
   (e.g. for IPTV or VoIP services) and Multicast (for IPTV).  Some
   customers delay-sensitive traffic (like Internet gaming) need to be

   sent through the fixed line interface to ensure quality of experience
   depending on customer requirements.

   This bypass behavior is accomplished by implementing a routing table
   which routes traffic which needs to bypass the tunnel through its
   relevant interfaces.  For example, IPTV related traffic might be
   routed over the fixed line interface to ensure the use of QoS.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate one code TBD for the dynamic GRE
   protocol.

10.  Security Considerations

   In the whole processing of HA, security of control messages MUST be
   guaranteed.  The CPE discovers the HAAP by resolving the HAAP address
   over DNS.  This protects the CPE against connections to foreign HAAP,
   if the DNS service and the domain name in the CPE isn't corrupted.

   The CPE should be prevented against receiving GRE notifications
   without a valid session In the whole processing of end to end HAAP
   session establishing and GRE notification signaling, the source IP
   address for session establishment from CPE MUST be strictly verified,
   including IP address authentication and identification at the HAAP
   side.  Any authentication mechanism with credential or checking the
   IP address is feasible.

   GRE notification key poisoning Every new session at the HAAP
   generates a magic number, which is encapsulated in the key field of
   the GRE header and will be carried in the signalling messages and
   data traffic for verification by comparing the Magic Number in the
   message and the Magic Number in the local session table.  Traffic
   without a valid Magic Number and outer IP address will be discarded
   on the HAAP.  Magic number is used for both control message and data
   message security.

   For data traffic security, it is also proposed to use IP address
   validation to protect against IP Spoofing attacks.
