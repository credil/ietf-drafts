      <t>The Short Message Service (SMS) and Unstructured
      Supplementary Service Data (USSD) of mobile cellular networks is
      frequently used in Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such
      as for telematic devices. The service offers small packet sizes
      and high delays just as other typical low-power and lossy
      networks (LLNs), i.e. 6LoWPANs. The design of the Constrained
      Application Protocol (CoAP), that took the limitations of LLNs
      into account, is thus also applicable to telematic M2M
      devices. The adaptation of CoAP to the SMS or USSD transport
      mechanisms and the combination with IP transported over cellular
      networks is described in this document.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification details the usage of the Constrained
      Application Protocol on the Short Message Service (SMS) or
      Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) of mobile
      cellular networks.</t>

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>
        In some M2M environments, internet connectivity is not supported
        by the constrained end-points, but a cellular network
        connection is supported instead. Internet connectivity might
        also be switched off for power saving reasons or the cellular
        coverage does not allow for Internet connectivity. In these
        situations, SMS and USSD will be supported, instead of UDP/IP
        over GPRS, HSPA or LTE.
        </t>
        <t>
        In Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), there is a new approved work
        item named "the Lightweight M2M Protocol", which aims at
        identifying requirements and defining protocols for M2M
        applications in cellular networks.
        </t>
        <t>
        In 3GPP, SMS is identified as the transport protocol for small
        data transmissions (See <xref target="3gpp_ts23_888" /> for
        Key Issue on Machine Type Communication (MTC) Device Trigger
        and the proposed solutions in Sections 6.2, 6.42, 6.44, 6.48,
        6.52, 6.60, and 6.61). In <xref target="3gpp_ts23_682" />
        'Architecture Enhancements to facilitate communications with
        Packet Data Networks and Applications' SMS is at the moment
        the only Trigger Delivery (Trigger Delivery using T4).

	USSD does seem to be in standardisation as a solution for MTC
	Device Trigger.
        </t>
<!-- Push USSD in 3GPP for MTC? -->
        <t>
	  M2M protocols using SMS, e.g. for telematics, are using
	  mostly various diverse proprietary and closed binary
	  protocols with limited publicly available documentation at
	  the moment.
        </t>
        <t>
	USSD is a very basic service in mobile networks which uses
	fewer network components to provide a service similar to
	SMS. This makes USSD very cheap for mobile network operators
	and chipset manufactures as they do not have to provide
	additional infrastructure. This is why USSD is from a
	technical point of view supported by all handsets and other
	mobile devices in all networks.
        </t>
        <t>
	Where SMS are normally stored in the SMS-C before the actual
	delivery takes place, USSD messages are not stored but
	delivered immediately. If it is impossible to deliver a USSD
	message within the first attempt, delivery fails. This could
	be a problem, but could also be seen as an advantage as long
	as delivery problems are covered by higher level protocols,
	such as CoAP. Without store-and-forward mechanisms the
	delivery is absolutely deterministic. There is only "success"
	or "failure" and no "wait a minute".
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
	<t>
	  The terms CoAP Server and CoAP Client are used synonymously
	  to Server and Client as specified in the terminology section
	  of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap" />.

      <section title="Scenarios">
	<t>
	Several scenarios are presented first for M2M communications
	with CoAP. First Mobile-Originating Mobile-Terminating (MO-MT)
	scenarios are presented, where both CoAP endpoints are in
	devices in a cellular network. Next, Mobile-Terminating (MT)
	scenarios are detailed, where only the CoAP server is in a

	where the CoAP client is in the cellular network.

      scenarios of CoAP in M2M communications.

      Two mobile cellular terminals communicate by exchanging CoAP
      Request and Response embedded into SMS PDUs (depicted in
      <xref target="cell2cell_sms" />).

      Two mobile cellular terminals communicate by exchanging the CoAP
      Request in an SMS PDU and the CoAP Response using GPRS
      transport. (depicted in <xref target="cell2cell_sms_gprs" />).

      </figure>

      The support for GPRS for the CoAP responses might be useful, so
      as to use SMS only for the request and as a wake-up signal for
      the device hosting the CoAP server. That device could then
      initiate a PDP context with the cellular network in order to
      bring up Internet connectivity. After having setup Internet
      connectivity, further message exchange can fully rely on
      IP. Network initiated PDP contexts could partly obsolete this
      mechanism.

      An IP host and a mobile cellular terminal communicate by
      exchanging CoAP Request and Response. The IP host uses protocols
      offered by the SMS-C (e.g. Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP
      <xref target="smpp" />), Computer Interface to Message
      Distribution (CIMD <xref target="cimd" />), Universal Computer
      Protocol/External Machine Interface (UCP/EMI <xref target="ucp"
      />)) to submit an SMS for delivery, which contains the CoAP
      Request (depicted in <xref target="ip2cell_sms" />).

       Note that the message exchange is just for one request message
       from CoAP Client and CoAP Server. It includes the following
       steps:
       </t>
       <t>
       Step 1: The CoAP Client sends a CoAP request in a SMS-SUBMIT
       message to the Service Center.  The CoAP Server address is
       specified as TP-Destination-Address (see <xref
      target="3gpp_ts_23_040" />).

       </t>
       <t>
       Step 2: The Service Center returns a SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT message
       to the CoAP Client.
       </t>
       <t>
       Step 3: The Service Center stores the received SMS message and
       forwards it to the CoAP Server, using an SMS-DELIVER
       message. The CoAP Client address is specified as a TP
       Originating Address (see <xref
      target="3gpp_ts_23_040" />).
       </t>
       <t>
       Step 4: The CoAP Server returns an SMS-DELIVER-REPORT message
       to the Service Center.
       </t>
       <t>
       Step 5: The Service Center returns the SMS-STATUS-REPORT
       message to the CoAP Client to indicate the SMS delivery status,
       if required by the CoAP Client.
       </t>
       <t>
       Note that the SMS-STATUS-REPORT message just indicates the
       transport layer SMS delivery status and has no relationship
       with the confirmable message or non-confirmable message. If the
       CoAP Client has sent a confirmable message, the CoAP Server
       MUST use a separate SMS message to transmit the ACK.

      <t>The content of SMS can be coded in 7, 8 or 16 bit characters <xref

      are:

      <list style="letters">
          <t>7 bit encoding: Sending 7 bit encoded SMS possible with

          <t>8 bit encoding: CoAP binary data does not need to be

<!--
      The currently safest solution is to use 7 bit encoded SMS
      including Base64 encoded CoAP payload.

          <t>CoAP Block <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-block" /></t>

      It is RECOMMENDED that SMS is not used to transfer very large

    <section title="Addressing">
      <t>
        For SMS in cellular networks, the CoAP endpoints have to work with a SIM
        (Subscriber Identity Module) card and have to be addressed by the
        MSISDN (Mobile Station ISDN (MSISDN) number).
      </t>
      <t>
        To allow the CoAP client to detect that the SMS message
        contains a CoAP message, the TP-DATA-Coding-Scheme SHOULD be
        included.
      </t>
      <t>
	For mobile-originated USSD the addressing is done by a so called
	application numbers.
      </t>

    <section title="Options">
      <t>
	Uri-Host: The Uri-Host option SHOULD only be sent, in case of

      <t>
	Uri-Port: The Uri-Host option SHOULD only be sent, in case of
	proxying. If no proxying is intended the option SHOULD NOT BE
	set.

      <t>
      It is possible that a malicious CoAP Client sends repeated
      requests, and it may cost money for the CoAP Server to use SMS
      to send back associated responses. To avoid this situation, the
      CoAP Server implementation can authenticate the CoAP Client
      before responding to the requests. For example, the CoAP Server
      can maintain a MSISDN white list. Only the MSISDN specified in
      the white list will be allowed to send requests. The requests
      from others will be ignored or rejected.
