       DNS Root Name Service Protocol and Deployment Requirements
                        draft-iab-2870bis-00.txt

Abstract

   The DNS Root Name service are a critical part of the Internet
   architecture.  The protocol and deployment requirements expected to
   be implemented for the DNS root name services are defined in this
   document.  Operational requirements are out of scope.  This document
   obsoletes and reclassifies RFC2870 as Historic.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC2870] discusses protocol and operational requirements for root
   name servers for Internet's domain name system(DNS) protocol
   [RFC1035].  Since its publication, both protocol and operational
   requirements have evolved.  The concensus of the community is to
   separate the two sets of requirements into two documents.  The
   operational requirements are defined in [RSSAC-001].  This document
   defines the protocol requirements and some deployment requirements.

   The root servers are authoritative servers of the unique [RFC2826]
   root zone (".")[ROOTZONE], the root-servers.net zone, and the zone
   for the .arpa top-level domain[ARPAZONE].  This document describes
   the external interface of the root name servers from a protocol
   viewpoint of the service.  It specifies basic requirements for the
   Internet that DNS clients meet when interacting with a root name
   service over the public Internet.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

1.1.  RFC 2870 as Historic

   This document obsoletes and reclassifies [RFC2870] as Historic.

2.  Protocol Requirements

   This section describes the high-level protocol requirements.
   Operative details are not discussed and are left to the operators of
   the root name service.

   The root name service:

      MUST implement [RFC1035] and [RFC2181].

      MUST support IPv4[RFC0791] and IPv6[RFC2460] transport of DNS
      queries and responses.

      MUST support UDP[RFC0768] and TCP[RFC0793] transport of DNS
      queries and responses.

      MUST generate checksums when sending UDP datagrams and MUST verify
      checksums when receiving UDP datagrams containing a non-zero
      checksum.

      MUST implement DNSSEC[RFC4035], as an authoritative name service
      serving signed zones accodingly.

3.  Deployment Requirements

   The root name service:

      MUST answer queries from any Internet host

      MUST serve the unique [RFC2826] root zone[ROOTZONE], the root-
      servers.net zone, and the zone for the .arpa top-level domain
      [ARPAZONE],[RFC3172].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify a new protocol.  However, the root
   name servers are a key component of the Internet architecture and
   play a key role into the overall security of the Internet[RFC2826].
   Specific security considerations on the DNS protocols are discussed
   in their respective specifications.  The security considerations on
   the operational side of the root name servers are discussed in
   [RSSAC-001].
