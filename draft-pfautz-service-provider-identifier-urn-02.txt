1.  Background

   A number of industry bodies have identified the need for a common
   global service provider identifier.  In the IETF the DRINKS working
   group has sought an identifier for the owner of objects to be
   provisioned in registries for the exchange of Session Establishment
   Data and the ENUM WG and E2MD BOF discussed the need for a service
   provider identifier to associate with E.164 numbers.  Outside of the
   IETF, the need for a service provider identifier has been discussed
   in ITU-T Study Group 2, in the i3 Forum, the GSMA, and ATIS.  In most
   of these discussions a preference has been expressed for a numeric
   identifier that might be obtained by any type of entity as opposed to
   only certain types of entities, e.g., carriers with a particular
   national legal status.  Although preference was also expressed for
   reuse of some existing identifier, if possible, as requirements have
   been elaborated no current identifier seems appropriate.  Thus, this
   document requests registration of a service provider identifier URN
   namespace.


2.  Requirements for Service Provider identifier

   It is suggested that Service Provider Identifiers have the following
   characteristics:
   o  They SHOULD be globally unique
   o  They SHOULD be numeric, at least 8 digits long
   o  They SHOULD be fixed length
   o  they SHOULD be available to any type of entity
   o  Entities SHOULD be able to obtain mulitple identifiers.
   o  Some range of identifiers SHOULD be reserved for internal entity
      usage.


3.  Namespace Considerations

   URN values are to be assigned by RIRs on a first come first served
   basis.  The resources to be identified are service providers, e.g.,
   (but not limited to) SIP service providers.  Entities may obtain
   multiple assignments.  A variety of services might be supported
   including exchange VoIP and other traffic types.

4.  Community Considerations

   Open assignment will allow all types of entities to exchange traffic
   as opposed to limiting the entities that may be represented as is the
   case with some other identifies (e.g., ITU-T M.1400 Carrier Codes).
   A fixed length digit string will be more easily processed by
   implementations that make use of prefixing as compared to Private
   Enterprise Numbers or ITADs, which are integer values.  The Private
   Enterprise Number approach of supporting multiple identifiers through
   subdelegation is also less suitable for use in prefixing contexts or
   where the SP identifier makes up part of a domain name, e.g.,
   spn{SPID}.ipxsp.org.  [GSMAPRDIR67] As the identifiers are intended
   for service providers rather than end users, it is proposed that
   registration be handled by the Regional Internet Registries though a
   process similar to that for Autonomous System Numbers.  The RIRs
   would charge a modest yearly fee that would discourage "junk"
   registrations while not raising a barrier to legitimate ones by even
   small entities.  The annual fee would also allow the RIRs to identify
   registrations no longer in use.  The RIRs would maintain a whois
   service for registrations.

   DIGIT=%x30-39

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

   Uniqueness is guaranteed as long as the assigned number is never
   reassigned.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

   TBD

   Process of identifier assignment:

   First come first served by Regional Internet Registries.

   Process for identifier resolution:

   None at this time.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

   exact digit string match

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

   No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

   None specified.

   Scope:

   Global.


6.  Security Considerations

   Any security considerations would be a product of the applications
   making use of the new service provider identifiers.


7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
