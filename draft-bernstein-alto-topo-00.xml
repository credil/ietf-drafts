    <abstract>
      <t>  Exposing additional topology information of networks to applications and users beyond that of the current
          ALTO protocol can enable
  many important existing and emerging use cases, and many network providers already provide additional information
  about their networks. At the same time, there is no standard for exposing
         network topology in a manner that provides simplification via abstraction
          to the application layer and information hiding via abstraction to the network
          provider.  In this document, we provide a survey of use-cases for extended network topology
          information,  present some initial requirements
  for such services, and then give a framework of how to
  integrate such an extended ALTO topology service with network control infrastructure.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>  Topology is a basic property of a network.  Hence there is a
  spectrum of use cases where an application (or user) can benefit
  from obtaining some knowledge of the topology of the network that it
  uses or considers using, beyond the "single-switch"abstraction topology abstraction presented in
          the ALTO Base Protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-alto-protocol"/>
          as discussed in <xref target="I-D.yang-alto-topology"></xref>.</t>

  <t>As a simple case, many networks already provide public views to
  their topologies so that current or potential users of their
  networks can learn more about their networks; for example, see
  <eref target="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/about/network/maps/map.xml">Verizon</eref>;
  <eref target="http://business.comcast.com/enterprise/about-us/our-network">Comcast</eref>;
   <eref target="http://www.centurylink.com/business/resource-center/network-maps/">CenturyLink</eref>;
  <eref target="http://www.bt.net/info/europe.shtml">BT</eref>;
     <eref target="http://www.chinatelecomusa.com/content.asp?pl=627&amp;sl=637

      <eref target="http://atlas.grnoc.iu.edu/atlas.cgi?map_name=Internet2%20IP%20Layer">Internet 2</eref>.

 A user
  (application) with such information may conduct a wide variety of
  analysis, for example, in determining its service provider(s).</t>

  <t>For more advanced use cases such as in a programmatic setting, a
  topology manager of a network may expose a topology of the network
  to an application so that the application can provide its input
  regarding the operations of the network. A concrete example setting
  is the recent development of Software Defined Networking (SDN); for
  example see <eref target="https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:
  Architectural_Framework">OpenDayLight</eref>;
      <eref target="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2013/papers/sigcomm/p87.pdf">Maple</eref>.</t>

  <t>The objective of this document is three folds: (1) it surveys general uses cases and
  existing designs of how network topologies are exposed to
  applications; (2) it presents the requirements in exposing network
  topologies;  and (3) it gives a
  framework of how network topologies to applications can be
  integrated into network control.</t>

      <section anchor="use_cases" title="Uses Cases">
          <t>Uses cases generally relate to some type of cost metric optimization, application policy,
              resource requirements (bandwidth), and/or performance criteria such as delay. In the following
              we give a non-exhaustive list of uses cases for a extended ALTO topology service.
              <list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
                  <t hangText="Large Bandwidth"><vspace blankLines="0"/>Applications that make extensive use
                      of network bandwidth resources are discussed in
                      <xref target="I-D.bernstein-alto-large-bandwidth-cases"/>. In addition to a general discussion
                      of large bandwidth requirements specific examples of video on demand and inter-data center
                      networking are given. An optimization example for a scheduled backup service can be found at
                      <eref target="http://www.grotto-networking.com/BackupExample.html">
                      http://www.grotto-networking.com/BackupExample.html</eref>.
                  </t>

                  <t hangText="Enhanced Reliability"><vspace blankLines="0"/>GMPLS <xref target="RFC3945"/> and GMPLS
                      routing <xref target="RFC4202"/> in particular have included enhanced reliability support in the
                      form of shared risk link group (SRLG) information that lets a path computation entity understand
                      which links are at risk of simultaneous failures (fate sharing). In addition in optical networks
                      link and node diverse paths are a common method to enhance reliability <xref target="OptControl"/>.
                    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
                      However in many cases only the application may have a full view of its reliability needs. For
                      example consider a high reliability application making use of multiple data centers for
                      redundancy and increased reliability, such reliability would be significantly diminished if
                      the paths to those data centers shared similar fates.
                  </t>

                  <t hangText="Latency Sensitivity"><vspace blankLines="0" /> From high performance gaming to high
                      frequency trading latency can critically impact application performance. However, reductions
                      in latency may need to be factored against other costs or resource requirements. As mentioned
                      in <eref target="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/10/168186-barbarians-at-the-gateways/abstract">
                          http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/10/168186-barbarians-at-the-gateways/abstract</eref> some
                      high frequency trading applications need to make use of both a low latency path and a high bandwidth
                      path.
                    </t>

                  <t hangText="Policy Enforcement"><vspace blankLines="0"/>Many application specific requirements such
                      as the HIPPA privacy rule, can place restrictions on where a certain customers data may be kept, or what
                      geographic regions a customers data can traverse, etc... Enhancing topology information made available
                      to an application can help it ensure such requirements are satisfied.

                      <t>This draft describes two generic use-cases that illustrate application layer traffic
                          optimization concepts applied to high bandwidth core networks. For the purposes here high
                          bandwidth will mean bandwidth that is significant with respect to the capacity of a wavelength
                          in a wavelength division multiplexed optical transport system, e.g., 10-40Gbps or more. For
                          each of these generic use cases, we present a generic optimization problem, look at the type
                          of information needed (query interface) to perform the optimization, investigate a reservation
                          interface to request network resources, and also consider enhanced availability and recovery
                          scenarios.

<title>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Architecture</title>

<abstract>
<t>Future data and transmission networks will consist of elements such as routers, switches, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems, Add-Drop Multiplexors (ADMs), photonic cross-connects (PXCs), optical cross-connects (OXCs), etc. that will use Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) to dynamically provision resources and to provide network survivability using protection and restoration techniques.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document describes the architecture of GMPLS. GMPLS extends MPLS to encompass time-division (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, G.709), wavelength (lambdas), and spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber). The focus of GMPLS is on the control plane of these various layers since each of them can use physically diverse data or forwarding planes. The intention is to cover both the signaling and the routing part of that control plane. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract><t>Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks.  For example, views to Internet routing tables at looking glass servers are available and can be practically downloaded to many network application clients.  What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network topologies from the point of view of ISPs.  In other words, what an ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.  The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides network information (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance.  The basic information of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a network.  These maps provide a simplified view, yet enough information about a network for applications to effectively utilize them.  Additional services are built on top of the maps.  This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service. Although the ALTO Service would primarily be provided by ISPs, other entities such as content service providers could also operate an ALTO Service.  Applications that could use this service are those that have a choice to which end points to connect.  Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</t></abstract>
