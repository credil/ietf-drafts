    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol(RTCP) Extended Report
      (XR) Block that allows the reporting of a simple discard count metric
      for use in a range of RTP applications.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <section title="Discard Count Report Block">
        <t>This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
        <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> for use in a range of RTP applications.
        The new block type supports the reporting of the number of packets
        which are received correctly but are never played out, typically
        because they arrive too late to be played out (buffer underflow) or
        too early (buffer overflow). The metric is applicable both to systems
        which use packet loss repair techniques (such as forward error
        correction <xref target="RFC5109"></xref> or retransmission <xref
        target="RFC4588"></xref>) and to those which do not.</t>

        <t>This metric is useful for identifying the existence, and
        characterizing the severity, of a packet transport problem which may
        affect users' perception of a service delivered over RTP.</t>

        <t>This block may be used in conjunction with <xref
        target="BGDISCARD"></xref> which provides additional information on
        the pattern of discarded packets. However the metric in <xref
        target="BGDISCARD"></xref> may be used independently of the metrics in
        this block.</t>

        <t>In case of Discard count metric block sent together with Burst gap
        discard metric block defined in <xref target="BGDISCARD"></xref> to
        the media sender or RTP based network management system, information
        carried in the discard count metric block and Burst gap discard metric
        block allows them calculate the some bust gap summary statistics,
        e.g., gap discard rate.</t>

        <t>The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end system
        metrics defined in <xref target="MONARCH"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defined an
        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This document defines a new Extended Report block for use with <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Architectures <xref
        target="MONARCH"></xref> provides guideline for reporting block format
        using RTCP XR. The Metrics Block described in this document are in
        accordance with the guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref> and
        <xref target="MONARCH"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>This metric is believed to be applicable to a large class of RTP
        applications which use a jitter buffer.</t>

        <t>Discards due to late or early arriving packets affects user
        experience. The reporting of discards alerts senders and other
        receivers to the need to adjust their transmission or reception
        strategies. The reports allow network managers to diagnose these user
        experience problems.</t>

        <t>The ability to detect duplicate packets can be used by managers to
        detect network layer or sender behavior which may indicate network or
        device issues. Based on the reports, these issues may be addressed
        prior to any impact on user experience.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <section title="Standards Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>In addition, the following terms are defined:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Received, Lost and Discarded"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to
            arrive within an implementation-specific time window. A packet
            that arrives within this time window but is too early or late to
            be played out or thrown away before playout due to packet
            duplication or redundancy shall be regarded as discarded. A packet
            shall be classified as one of received (or OK), discarded or lost.
            The Discard Count Metric counts only discarded packets. The metric
            "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in <xref
            target="RFC3550"></xref> reports a count of packets lost from the
            media stream (single SSRC within single RTP session). Similarly
            the metric "number of packets discarded" reports a count of
            packets discarded from the media stream (single SSRC within single
            RTP session) arriving at the receiver. Another metric defined in
            <xref target="RFC5725"></xref> is available to report on packets
            which are not recovered by any repair techniques which may be in
            use. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

      <section title="Definition of Fields in Discard Count Metric Report Block">
        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Block type (BT): 8 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />A
            Discard Count Metric Report Block is identified by the constant
            PDC.<vspace blankLines="1" /> [Note to RFC Editor: please replace
            PDC with the IANA provided RTCP XR block type for this block.]
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />This field indicates whether the reported metric
            is an interval, cumulative, or sampled metric <xref
            target="MONARCH"></xref>. The Discard Count Metric value can be
            reported as either an interval metric (I=10) or a cumulative
            metric (I=11). It does not make sense to report the Discard Count
            Metric as a sampled metric, so the value I=01 MUST NOT be used.
            The value I=00 is reserved, and MUST NOT be used. <vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Discard Type (DT): 2bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />This field is used to identify the discard type
            used in this report block. The discard type is defined as
            follows:<list>
                <t>00: Report packet discarded or being thrown away before
                playout due to packets duplication.</t>

                <t>01: Report packet discarded due to too early to be played
                out.</t>

                <t>10: Report packet discarded due to too late to be played
                out.</t>

                <t>11: Report the total number of discarded packets due to
                both early and late to be played out.</t>
              </list>An endpoint MAY report only one of the above four discard
            types blocks in an compound RTCP report in a reporting interval.
            It MAY also report a combination of discard types in a compound
            RTCP report but not all combinations are valid. The endpoint MAY
            report duplicate packet discard (DT=0) block with any other
            discard (DT=1, 2, or 3) block. Additionally, an endpoint MUST NOT
            report combined discard (DT=3) block with early discard (DT=1) or
            late discard (DT=2) report block. <vspace blankLines="1" />Some
            systems send duplicate RTP packets for robustness or error
            resilience. This is NOT RECOMMENDED since it breaks RTCP packet
            statistics. If duplication is desired for error resilience, the
            mechanism described in <xref target="RTPDUP"></xref> can be used,
            since this will not cause breakage of RTP streams or RTCP
            statistics.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Reserved (resv): 4 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />These bits are reserved. They MUST be set to zero
            by senders and ignored by receivers.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="block length: 16 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" /> The
            length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one. For the
            Discard Count block, the block length is equal to 2.<vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="SSRC of source: 32 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />As
            defined in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.<vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="number of packets discarded: 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />Number of packets discarded over the period
            (Interval or Cumulative) covered by this report. <vspace
            blankLines="1" /> If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the
            value 0xFFFFFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-range
            measurement. If the measurement is unavailable, the value
            0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported. <vspace blankLines="1" />Note that
            the number of packets expected in the period associated with this
            metric (whether interval or cumulative) is available from the
            difference between a pair of extended sequence numbers in the
            Measurement Information block <xref target="MEASI"></xref>, so
            need not be repeated in this block. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
