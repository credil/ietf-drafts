      <t>Several solutions (e.g., <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast"></xref>) are proposed for
      the delivery of multicast services in the context of transition to IPv6.
      Even if these solutions may have different applicable use cases, they
      all use specific IPv6 addresses to embed IPv4 addresses, for both
      multicast group, and multicast source addresses.</t>

      <t>This document defines a DHCPv6 option <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>
      to convey the IPv6 prefixes to be used for constructing these
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.</t>

      <t>This option can be in particular used in the context of DS-Lite <xref
      target="RFC6333"></xref>, Stateless A+P <xref target="RFC6346"></xref>
      and other IPv4-IPv6 transition techniques.</t>

    <section title="Configuration Guidelines (Server Side)">
      <t>DHCP servers supporting OPTION_PREFIX64 should be configured with
      U_PREFIX64 and at least one ASM_PREFIX64 or one SSM_PREFIX64.</t>

      <t>Both ASM_PREFIX64 and SSM_PREFIX64 may be configured and therefore be
      returned to a requesting DHCP client; it is deployment-specific. In
      particular, if both SSM and ASM modes are supported, ASM_PREFIX64 and
      SSM_PREFIX64 prefixes must be configured. For SSM deployments, both
      SSM_PREFIX64 and U_PREFIX64 should be configured.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Client Behaviour">
      <t>To retrieve the IPv6 prefixes that will be used to synthesize unicast
      and multicast IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses, the DHCPv6 client MUST
      include OPTION_PREFIX64 in its OPTION_ORO. If the DHCPv6 client receives
      more than one OPTION_PREFIX64 option from the DHCPv6 server:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>If all the enclosed IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast prefixes have
          the same scope, the first instance of the option MUST be used.</t>

          <t>If each enclosed IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast prefix has a
          distinct scope, the client MUST select the appropriate IPv4-embedded
          IPv6 multicast prefix having a scope matching the IPv4 multicast
          address used to synthesize an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
          address.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If asm-length, ssm-length and unicast-length fields are all set to 0,
      the DHCPv6 client MUST behave as if OPTION_PREFIX64 had not been
      received in the response received from the DHCPv6 server.</t>

      <t>If the asm-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by
      ASM_PREFIX64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
      addresses in the ASM range. This is achieved by concatenating the
      ASM_PREFIX64 and the IPv4 multicast address; the Pv4 multicast address
      is inserted in the last 32 bits of the IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
      address.</t>

      <t>If the ssm-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by
      SSM_PREFIX64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
      addresses in the SSM range. This is achieved by concatenating the
      SSM_PREFIX64 and the IPv4 multicast address; the Pv4 multicast address
      is inserted in the last 32 bits of the IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
      address.</t>

      <t>If the unicast-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified
      by U_PREFIX64 field is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 unicast
      addresses as specified in <xref target="RFC6052"></xref>.</t>
