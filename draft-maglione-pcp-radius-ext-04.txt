              RADIUS Extensions for Port Control Protocol
                    draft-maglione-pcp-radius-ext-04

Abstract

   This memo proposes a new Remote Authentication Dial In User Service
   (RADIUS) attribute to carry the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of
   a Port Control Protocol (PCP) server, such that while the PCP server
   information is configured on a RADIUS server, the information can be
   conveyed to Network Access Server (NAS) via RADIUS protocol, and the
   co-located Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP/DHCPv6) server
   can then populate the information to PCP client.

Internet-Draft            PCP RADIUS Extensions                June 2012


1.  Introduction

   Port Control Protocol (PCP) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] provides a mechanism
   to control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices
   such as NATs and firewalls.  PCP is a client-server protocol where a
   PCP client may reside on a host, a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE),
   etc., which communicates with a PCP server that may reside anywhere
   in a network.

   A PCP client must know the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of a
   PCP server, before it can communicate with the later in order to
   perform the relevant PCP functions.

   [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] defines DHCPv6 and DHCP options which are meant
   to be used by a PCP client to discover a PCP server name.  However,
   provisioning for name of the PCP server is required on a DHCP/DHCPv6
   server before it can populate these information.

   Auto-configuration on a DHCP/DHCPv6 is possible in a broadband
   network, where typically, user profile is maintained on a Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server and RADIUS
   protocol [RFC2865] is used to convey user related information to
   other network elements including a host and CPE.
   [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access] describes a typical broadband network
   scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS) acts as the access
   gateway for the users (hosts or CPEs) and the NAS embeds a DHCPv6
   Server function that allows it to locally handle any DHCPv6 requests
   issued by the clients.

   In such environment, PCP server's name can be configured on a RADIUS
   server, which then passes the information to a NAS that co-locates
   with the DHCP/DHCPv6 server, which in turn populates the location of
   the PCP server.

   This memo defines a new RADIUS attribute that can be used to carry
   the FQDN of a PCP server.

   The approach described above is already used for providing the FQDN
   of the AFTR in the DS-Lite scenario and the equivalent RADIUS
   attribute for the DS-Lite Tunnel Name is defined [RFC6519].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]:

        - Port forwarding
        - PCP
        - PCP client
        - PCP Server


3.  PCP Server Configuration using RADIUS and DHCP/DHCPv6

   Figure 1 illustrates how RADIUS protocol works together with DHCPv6,
   to allow a host to learn automatically the FQDN of a PCP server in
   case of a PPP session that carries IPv6 traffic.

   The Network Access Server (NAS) operates as a client of RADIUS and
   co-locates with a DHCPv6 Server for DHCPv6 protocol.  The NAS
   initially sends a RADIUS Access Request message to the RADIUS server,
   requesting authentication.  Once the RADIUS server receives the
   request, it validates the sending client and if the request is
   approved, the RADIUS server replies with an Access Accept message
   including a list of attribute-value pairs that describe the
   parameters to be used for this session.  This list MAY also contain
   the name of a PCP server.  When the co-located DHCPv6 server receives
   a DHCPv6 message containing the PCP Server Option, it SHALL use the
   name returned in the RADIUS attribute as defined in this memo to
   populate the DHCPv6 PCP Server option defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp]

        Figure 1: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Message Flow for a PPP Session

   The Figure 2 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work
   together to accomplish PCP client configuration when DHCPv6 is used
   to provide connectivity to the user.

   The difference between this message flow and previous one is that in
   this scenario the interaction between NAS and AAA/ RADIUS Server is
   triggered by the DHCPv6 Solicit message received by the NAS from the
   B4 acting as DHCPv6 client, while in case of a PPP Session the
   trigger is the PPP LCP Config Request message received by the NAS.

        Figure 2: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Message Flow for an IP Session

   In the scenario depicted in Figure 2 the Access-Request packet
   contains a Service-Type attribute with the value Authorize Only (17),
   thus according to [RFC5080] the Access-Request packet MUST contain a
   State attribute.

   A similar message flow also applies to the IPv4 scenario when DHCPv4
   is used to provide connectivity to the user (Figure 3).

        Figure 3: RADIUS and DHCPv4 Message Flow for an IP Session

   After receiving the PCP server name in the initial Access-Accept the
   NAS MUST store the received PCP Server Name locally.  When the PCP
   Client sends a DHCP message to request an extension of the lifetimes
   for the assigned address or prefix, the NAS does not have to initiate
   a new Access-Request towards the AAA server to request the PCP server
   name.  The NAS retrieves the previously stored PCP Server name and
   uses it in its reply.

   If the DHCP server to which the DHCP Renew message was sent at time
   T1 has not responded, the DHCP client initiates a Rebind/Reply
   exchange with any available server.  In this scenario the NAS MUST
   initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA server, after the co-
   located DHCP server receives the DHCP message.  The NAS MAY include
   the PCP Server Name attribute in its Access-Request.

   If the NAS does not receive the PCP server name attribute in the
   Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default tunnel
   name, if any.  If the NAS does not have any pre-configured default
   tunnel name or if the NAS receives an Access-Reject, the PCP client
   can not be configured by the NAS.

   The scenario with PPP Session and IPv4 only connectivity does not
   require the DHCP protocol: the whole configuration of the client is
   performed by PPP.  This case is out of scope of this document because
   in order to complete the configuration of the PCP client a new PPP

   IPC option would be required.


4.  RADIUS Attribute

   A new RADIUS attribute, called PCP-Server-Name, along with its format
   is defined below.

   Description

   The PCP-server-name attribute contains a Fully Qualified Domain Name
   (FQDN) that refers to a PCP server the client requests to establish a
   connection to for PCP related service.  The NAS shall use the name
   returned in the RADIUS PCP-server-name attribute to populate the PCP
   Server FQDN DHCP Sub-Option in IPv4 addressing context, or the PCP
   Server FQDN DHCPv6 Option in IPv6 addressing context, as determined
   by the DHCP server [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp]

   The PCP-server-name attribute MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet.
   This attribute MAY be used in Access-Request packets as a hint to the
   RADIUS server; for example if the NAS is pre-configured with a
   default PCP server name, this name MAY be inserted in the attribute.
   The RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint sent by the NAS and it MAY
   assign a different PCP Server name.  If the NAS includes the PCP
   Server Name attribute, but the AAA server does not recognize it, this
   attribute MUST be ignored by the AAA Server.  If the NAS does not
   receive PCP Server Name attribute in the Access-Accept it MAY
   fallback to a pre-configured default PCP server name, if any.  If the
   NAS is pre-provisioned with a default PCP server name and the PCP
   server name received in Access-Accept is different from the
   configured default, then the PCP server name received in the Access-
   Accept message MUST be used for the session.

   The PCP server Name RADIUS attribute MAY be present in Accounting-
   Request records where the Acct-Status-Type is set to Start, Stop or
   Interim-Update.  The PCP Server Name RADIUS attribute MUST NOT appear
   more than once in a message.

   A summary of the PCP-Server-Name RADIUS attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.
