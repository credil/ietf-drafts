        A Fast-Track way to Proposed Standard with Running Code
                          draft-farrell-ft-00

Abstract

   This memo proposes an optional fast-track way to get from a working
   group document to IESG review that can be used for cases when a
   working group chair believes that there is open-source running code
   that implements a working group Internet-Draft.  The basic idea is to
   do all of working group last call, IETF last call and area director
   review during the same two week period, and to impose a higher
   barrier for comments that might block progress.  The motivation is to
   offer a reward for running code, consistent with the IETF's overall
   philosophy of running code and rough consensus.  This version is an
   initial draft solely proposed by the author (and not the IESG) to
   attempt to ascertain if there is enough interest in this to warrant
   trying out the idea as an RFC 3933 process experiment.

Status of this Memo

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference

Internet-Draft           Running Code Fast Track           December 2012


1.  Introduction

   This is an initial draft solely proposed by the author (and not the
   IESG) to attempt to ascertain if there is enough interest in this to
   warrant trying out the idea as an [RFC3933] experiment.

   The idea here is not to save the universe, nor to boil any oceans.
   WG's are still liable to sometimes take years to get to the point
   where this "fastrack" might apply.  However, the author thinks that
   this is taking the IETF in the right direction and so is worth a
   look.  This approach might also help with recent cases where smaller
   open-source software groups have found the IETF process difficult for
   various reasons.


2.  Fast-Track Processing

   Sometimes, it can take a long time to get a Proposed Standard
   produced in the IETF.  This memo proposes an optional way to speed up
   the parts of the process that happen after a working group (WG) has
   done its job as a "reward" for having an open-source implementation
   available at that time.

   There is probably no need to refer to [RFC2119] here, but why not:-)

   The basic idea is that a WG chair can choose to progress a WG draft
   on the "fast-track" in some circumstances.

   When a document is being progressed on the fast-track, the following
   changes from [BCP9] apply, and define the new "fast-track last call"
   state:

   1.  Working group last call (WGLC), IETF last call (IETF-LC) and Area
       Director (AD) review all run in parallel over the same two-week
       period.

   2.  Only comments that would be "DISCUSS-worthy" according to the
       IESG Discuss Criteria [DCRIT] need be handled during last call.
       Other comments can be handled or not, at the authors/editors
       discretion.

   3.  After fast-track last-call, the document must either be returned
       to the WG, or else enter IESG review as soon as any changes
       required are made.  The relevant AD makes the decision as to
       whether changes are required and when those are completed
       sufficiently to move to the next stage.

   4.  As soon as the authors/editors have made any changes required as
       a result of fast-track last-call, then the document will enter
       IESG review and will be automatically placed on the next IESG
       telechat agenda.

   5.  Given the fast-track processing, the relevant AD is not expected
       to (but of course can) ballot "Yes" for the document.  Draft
       progression after IESG review is otherwise unaffected, so a "Yes"
       ballot is needed from some AD.


3.  Fast-Track Rules

   Some rules associated with this new fast-track are as follows:

   1.  Only a WG chair can choose to propose a draft from her working
       group that is aimed for Proposed Standard for fast-track
       processing.

   2.  Where there are two or more WG chairs, all need to agree to fast-
       track processing.

   3.  An open-source implementation of the draft is required for fast-
       track last-call.  If there is no implementation or if the
       implementation is unavailable or does not implement the draft
       sufficiently closely then the document needs to be returned to
       the WG.  Note: this only requires one implementation, not two.

   4.  An AD can choose to accept the word of a WG chair that the
       implementation is available and sufficiently accurate, or an AD
       might choose to confirm this herself or via a third-party.

   5.  A document can only be proposed on the fast-track once.  That is,
       if the document comes back to the WG after having been proposed
       on the fast-track, then normal processing must be used if that
       draft is to be progressed subsequently.

   6.  WG chairs ought to provide sufficient notice to the relevant AD
       that they will be using the fast-track last-call process and
       should ensure that the AD has sufficient time to carry out a
       review of the draft during fast-track last call.

   7.  This one is not a "rule" but where a WG chair indicates that a
       work item is planned for fast-track processing, then the IESG and
       IAOC ought to try to accomodate requests for space and other
       logistics to support this at IETF meetings.  Of course, what is
       possible will depend on the venue and on resources available and
       required, but the goal of the IETF ought be to try to help the WG

       to get the document to the point where fast-track processing can
       be done, which implies helping the WG with efforts to develop the
       open-source implementation required.


4.  IANA Considerations

   [[To be removed, there aren't any.]]


5.  Security Considerations

   Since this is proposed by a security AD something is clearly needed
   here.  A WG chair and author could collude to launch an attack on the
   WG's AD by proposing a draft with code containing a trojan.  Not much
   fun or profit for anyone there though:-)


6.  Acknowledgements

   Sean Turner provided some useful changes to an earlier version.
   [[More later is this is dead-on-arrival.]]
