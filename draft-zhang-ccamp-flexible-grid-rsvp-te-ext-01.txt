1. Introduction 

   [G.694.1v1] defines the DWDM frequency grids for WDM applications. A 
   frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies used to denote 
   allowed nominal central frequencies that may be used for defining 
   applications. The channel spacing, i.e. the frequency spacing 
   between two allowed nominal central frequencies can be 12.5 GHz, 25 
   GHz, 50 GHz, 100 GHz and integer multiples of 100 GHz as defined in 
   [G.694.1v1]. All of the wavelengths on a fiber SHALL use different 
   central frequencies and occupy a fixed bandwidth of frequency.  

   [G.FLEXIGRID], an updated version of [G.694.1v1] has be consented in 
   December 2011 in support of flexible grids. The terms "frequency

   slot (i.e. the frequency range allocated to a specific channel and 
   unavailable to other channels within a flexible grid)" and "slot 
   width" (i.e. the full width of a frequency slot in a flexible grid) 
   are introduced to define a flexible grid. A channel is represented 
   as an LSC (Lambda Switching Capable) LSP in the control plane and 
   occupies a frequency slot on each fiber it traverses. In the case of 
   flexible grid, the different flexi-LSPs may have different slot 
   widths on a given fiber, referring to [SSON-FWK].  

   [WSON-SIG] describes the requirements and extensions for WSON 
   signaling. It focuses on the control of optical networks using a 
   fixed DWDM grid. This document describes the additional requirements 
   and extensions for signaling of LSPs using the felxi-grid 
   capabilities.  

2. Terminology  

   Flexi-grid: See [SSON-FWK]. 

   Slot Width: See [SSON-FWK]. 

   Frequency Range: See [SSON-FWK]. 

   SSON: Spectrum-Switched Optical Networks; See [SSON-FWK]. 

   flexi-LSP: See [SSON-FWK].  

   RSA: See [SSON-FWK]. 

3. Requirements for Flexible Grid Signaling   

   A flexi-LSP SHOULD occupy a frequency slot, i.e. a range of 
   frequencies. The process of computing a route and the allocation of 
   a frequency slot is referred to as RSA (Routing and Spectrum 
   Assignment).  

   [SSON-FWK] describes three types of architecture approaches to RSA, 
   which are: combined RSA, separated RSA and distributed SA. The first 
   two approaches among them could be called "centralized SA", since 
   both routing and spectrum (frequency slot) assignment are performed 
   by centralized entity before the signaling procedure.  

   In the case of centralized SA, the assigned frequency slot SHOULD be 
   specified in the Path message. In the case of distributed SA, the 
   slot width of the flexi-LSP SHOULD be specified in the Path message, 
   allowing the involved network elements (e.g., the egress node) to 
   perform such distributed assignment.

   Similar to a fixed grid network, if the capability of shifting or 
   converting the whole optical spectrum allocated to a flexi-LSP is 
   not available, the flexi-LSP is subject to the Optical "Spectrum 
   Continuity Constraint", as described in [SSON-FWK].  

3.1. Slot Width  

   The slot width is an end-to-end parameter representing how much 
   frequency resource is requested for a flexi-LSP. Since different 
   LSPs may request different amounts of frequency resource in flexible 
   grid networks, the slot width SHOULD be carried in the signaling 
   message, so that all the nodes along the LSP can know how much 
   frequency resource (including both central frequency and slot width) 
   will be allocated for the LSP.  

3.2. Frequency Slot  

   The frequency slot information represents which part of the 
   frequency resource is allocated on each link for a flexi-LSP. This 
   information SHOULD be carried hop-by-hop in signaling message so 
   that each node can indicate its neighbor the resource reservation on 
   the link between them. 

   The frequency slot can be represented by the two parameters: central 
   frequency and slot width, as follows:  

      Frequency slot = [(central frequency) - (slot width)/2] ~  
                       [(central frequency) + (slot width)/2]  

   Since the slot width information is carried in the signaling message 
   (as described in Section 2.1), also the central frequency parameter 
   SHOULD be carried in the signaling message for frequency slot 
   determination. 

   As described in [G.FLEXIGRID], for the flexible DWDM grid, the 
   allowed frequency slots have a nominal central frequency (in THz) 
   defined by: 

   193.1 + n * 0.00625, where n is a positive or negative integer 
   including 0, and 0.00625 is the nominal central frequency 
   granularity in THz. 

   and a slot width defined by: 

   12.5 * m, where m is a positive integer and 12.5 is the slot width 
   granularity in GHz.

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-rsvp-te-ext-01.txt           March 2012 
    

   Applications may be defined where only a subset of the possible slot 
   widths and positions are required to be supported. For example, an 
   application could be defined where the nominal central frequency 
   granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring values of n that are even) 
   and that only requires slot widths as a multiple of 25 GHz (by only 
   requiring values of m that are even).  

   Figure 1 shows an example of two flexi-LSPs traversing a link and 
   illustrates how to determine the frequency slot based on the central 
   frequency and slot width information.  

                         Frequency Slot 1     Frequency Slot 2 
                           -------------     -------------------

                 Figure 1 - Two flexi-LSPs traverse a Link 
    
   The two wavelengths shown in figure 1 have the following meaning:  

   flexi-LSP 1: central frequency = 193.1 THz, slot width = 25 GHz. It 
   means the frequency slot [193.0875 THz, 193.1125 THz] is assigned to 
   this flexi-LSP.  

   flexi-LSP 2: central frequency = 193.14375 THz, slot width = 37.5 
   GHz. It means the frequency slot [193.125 THz, 193.1625 THz] is 
   assigned to this flexi-LSP.  

   Note that the frequency slots of two flexi-LSPs on a fiber MUST NOT 
   overlap with each other.  

4. Extensions  

   This section defines the extensions of signaling for flexible grid.  

4.1. SSON Traffic Parameters  

   As described in Section 2, the slot width represents how much 
   frequency resource is requested for a flexi-LSP, i.e., it describes 
   the end-to-end traffic profile of the LSP. Therefore, the slot width 
   SHOULD be regarded as a traffic parameter for a flexi-LSP.  

 
 
Zhang                  Expires September 2012                  [Page 5] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-rsvp-te-ext-01.txt           March 2012 
    

   The SSON traffic parameters are organized as follows:  

    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   |     m         |                      Reserved                 | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   m (8 bits): the slot width is specified by m*12.5 GHz.  

   Note that the slot width of a fixed grid defined in [G.694.1v1] can 
   also be specified by m because the defined channel spacings (12.5 
   GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz, 100 GHz and integer multiples of 100 GHz) are 
   also the multiple of 12.5 GHz. Therefore, the traffic parameters are 
   general for SSON including both fixed grid (i.e. WSON) and flexible 
   grid. 

   The SSON traffic parameters are carried in the SENDER_TSPEC object 
   within a Path message and in the FLOWSPEC object within a Resv 
   message:  

   SSON SENDER_TSPEC: Class = 12, C-Type = to be assigned by IANA, 
   preferred 8.  

   SSON FLOWSPEC: Class = 9, C-Type = to be assigned by IANA, preferred 
   8.  

    

4.2. Generalized Label  

   In the case of a flexible grid link, the allocated central frequency 
   is calculated as follows:  

           Central Frequency = (193.1 + n * 0.00625) THz         

   Where n can be a positive or negative integer, or 0.  

   The Generalized Label object is used to indicate the resource 
   reserved on a link. In Flexible Grid networks, it is used to 
   indicate which frequency slot is allocated on a link for the given 
   flexi-LSP.  

   Since the frequency slot assigned to a flexi-LSP can be determined 
   by the combination of [central frequency, slot width], while the 
   slot width of a flexi-LSP is specified in the traffic parameters, 
   the Label object just needs to carry the assigned central frequency.

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-rsvp-te-ext-01.txt           March 2012 
    

   Therefore, the wavelength label format defined in [RFC6205] can be 
   reused to specify the central frequency of a flexi-LSP, without any 
   change on the label format.  

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |Grid | C.S.  |    Identifier   |                n              | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     
   The meaning of Grid, Identifier and n fields are not changed. The 
   usage of the label format is also not changed.  

   According to [G.FLEXIGRID], flexible grid still belongs to DWDM, so 
   there is no need to introduce a new type of Grid, i.e., Grid=1 (ITU-
   T DWDM) SHOULD be used for flexible grid.  

   In case of Grid=1 (ITU-T DWDM), according to [G.697v2.1], a new 
   value of C.S. is defined for flexible 6.25 GHz grid. The 
   C.S.(Channel Spacing) field is defined as follows:  

      +--------------+---------+ 
      |C.S. (GHz)    |  Value  | 
      +--------------+---------+ 
      | Reserved     |    0    | 
      +--------------+---------+ 
      |    100       |    1    | 
      +--------------+---------+ 
      |    50        |    2    | 
      +--------------+---------+ 
      |    25        |    3    | 
      +--------------+---------+ 
      |    12.5      |    4    | 
      +--------------+---------+ 
      |Flexible grid | 5 (TBA) | 
      +--------------+---------+ 
      |Future use    | 6 ~ 15  | 
      +--------------+---------+ 
    
   The frequency is calculated as such in [G.FLEXIGRID]: 

   Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz)

   For the case where the channel spacing value is set to "Flexible 
   grid", a channel spacing of 6.25 GHz MUST be used in the above 
   formula.  

4.3. Signaling Procedures  

   This section describes the signaling procedures for distributed SA 
   and centralized SA (See [SSON-FWK]).   

4.3.1. Distributed SA  

   In this case, only the route is provided by a PCE or ingress node 
   before the signaling procedure. The available central frequencies 
   SHALL be collected hop by hop and the egress node SHOULD select a 
   proper central frequency for the LSP.  

   After the route is computed, the ingress node SHOULD find out the 
   available central frequencies for the LSP on the next link of the 
   route. If the frequency slot does not overlap with the existing 
   flexi-LSPs, the central frequency is considered to be available for 
   the requesting flexi-LSP.  

   Then a Path message is sent to the next node on the route. The Path 
   message MUST contain a SSON SENDER_TSPEC object to specify the slot 
   width of the flexi-LSP. A LABEL_SET object SHALL be added to the 
   Path message, which contains the candidate central frequencies for 
   the LSP on the next link.  

   When an intermediate node receives a Path message, it can get the 
   slot width from the SSON SENDER_TSPEC object. Then it SHOULD find 
   the available central frequencies for the LSP on the next link of 
   the route similar to the ingress node. The common part of the two 
   available central frequency sets, i.e. the set received from the 
   Path message and the set of the next link, SHALL be selected as the 
   new available central frequency set for the LSP. If the new set is 
   null, the Path message SHALL be rejected by a PathErr message. 
   Otherwise, the LABEL SET object in the Path message SHALL be updated 
   according to the new set and the Path message is forwarded to the 
   next node on the route.  

   When an egress node receives a Path message, it SHOULD select an 
   available central frequency from the LABEL SET object based on local 
   policy and determine the frequency slot based on the slot width and 
   the selected central frequency (See section 2.2). Then a Resv 
   message is responded so that the nodes along the LSP can establish 
   the optical cross-connect based on the frequency slot determined by

   the slot width in the traffic parameters and the central frequency 
   in the label.  

4.3.2. Centralized SA  

   In this case, both of the route and the frequency slot are provided 
   by the PCE or ingress node. When signaling the LSP, the slot width 
   is carried in the traffic parameters, and the assigned central 
   frequency is carried in the Label ERO. When the nodes along the LSP 
   receive the Path message carrying this information, they can 
   determine the frequency slot by the slot width and the central 
   frequency, so that they can establish the optical cross-connect 
   based on the central frequency. The procedures of ERO and Label ERO 
   are the same as described in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473]. 

5. Example  

   An example is provided as below. In this example, assume that there 
   are two links and three nodes for the network topology and a flex-
   LSP is assumed to be created from Node N1 to Node N3.

                        |--Available Frequency Range--| 
    
   The symbol '+' represents the allowed nominal central frequency. The 
   symbol "--" represents a 6.25 GHz frequency unit. The number on the 
   top of the line represents the 'n' in the frequency calculation 
   formula (193.1 + n * 0.00625). The nominal central frequency is 
   193.1 THz when n equals zero.

   o  Source node: N1 
   o  Sink node: N3 
   o  Slot width: 25 GHz 
    
   The usable central frequencies set for the flexi-LSP is 
   [n=0,1,2,3,4,5,6] on link1. But on link2, because the central 
   frequency granularity is 12.5 GHz, The usable central frequencies 
   set for the flexi-LSP is [n=0,2,4].  

   In the case of Centralized SA, PCE or ingress node (N1) could 
   allocate an available frequency slot to the flexi-LSP, e.g. n=2 and 
   slot width=50 Ghz. During the LSP setup procedures, the slot width 
   (50 GHz, i.e. m=4) should be specified in the traffic parameters 
   objects and the central frequency (n=2) should be specified in the 
   label objects.  

6. IANA Considerations 

6.1. RSVP Objects Class Types 

   This document introduces two new Class Types for existing RSVP 
   objects. IANA is requested to make allocations from the "Resource 
   ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry using the "Class 
   Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" sub-registry. 

       Class Number  Class Name                            Reference 
       ------------  -----------------------               --------- 
       9             FLOWSPEC                              [RFC2205] 
        
                     Class Type (C-Type): 
        
                     (TBA) SSON FLOWSPEC                   [This.I-D] 
        
       Class Number  Class Name                            Reference 
       ------------  -----------------------               --------- 
       12            SENDER_TSPEC                          [RFC2205] 
        
                     Class Type (C-Type): 
     
                     (TBA) SSON SENDER_TSPEC               [This.I-D] 
    
6.2. DWDM Channel Spacing 

   The IANA has created a registry and manages the space of DWDM 
   Channel Spacing as described in section 5.2 of [RFC6205]. It is 
   requested that the IANA makes assignments from the DWDM Channel 
   Spacing.
