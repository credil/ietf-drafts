                Mobility Practices and DMM Gap Analysis
                    draft-zuniga-dmm-gap-analysis-03

Abstract

   This document describes practices for the deployment of existing
   mobility protocols in a distributed mobility management (DMM)
   environment, and identifies the limitations in the current practices
   with respect to providing the expected DMM functionality.

   The practices description and gap analysis are performed for IP-based
   mobility protocols, dividing them into three main families: IP
   client-based, IP network-based, and 3GPP mobility solutions.

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis               December 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) approach aims at setting up
   IP networks so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does
   not rely on centrally deployed anchors to manage IP mobility
   sessions.

   A first step towards the definition of DMM solutions is the
   definition of the problem of distributed mobility management and the
   identification of the main requirements for a distributed mobility
   management solution [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   We first analyze existing practices of deployment of IP mobility
   solutions from a DMM perspective [I-D.perkins-dmm-matrix],
   [I-D.patil-dmm-issues-and-approaches2dmm].  After that, a gap
   analysis is carried out, identifying what can be achieved with
   existing solutions and what is missing in order to meet the DMM
   requirements identified in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].


2.  Practices: deployment of existing solutions in a DMM fashion

   This section documents practices for the deployment of existing
   mobility protocols in a distributed mobility management (DMM)
   fashion.  The scope is limited to existing IPv6-based and 3GPP
   mobility protocols, such as Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275], NEMO Basic Support
   Protocol [RFC3963], Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213], 3GPP GPRS Tunnelling
   Protocol, and protocol extensions, such as Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
   [RFC5380], Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers [RFC5568], Localized Routing
   for Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC6705], or 3GPP Selective IP Traffic Offload
   (SIPTO), among others [RFC6301].

   The section is divided in three parts: IP client-based mobility, IP
   network-based mobility and 3GPP mobility solutions.

2.1.  Client-based IP mobility

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC6275] and its extension to support mobile
   networks, the NEMO Basic Support protocol (hereafter, simply NEMO)
   [RFC3963] are well-known client-based IP mobility protocols.  They
   heavily rely on the function of the Home Agent (HA), a centralized
   anchor, to provide mobile nodes (hosts and routers) with mobility
   support.  We next describe how Mobile IPv6/NEMO and several
   additional protocol extensions can be deployed to meet some of the
   DMM requirements [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

     Figure 1: Distributed operation of Mobile IPv6 (BT and RO) / NEMO

   Due to the heavy dependence on the home agent role, the base Mobile
   IPv6 and NEMO protocols (i.e., without additional extensions) cannot
   be easily deployed in a distributed fashion.  One approach to
   distribute the anchors can be to deploy several HAs (as shown in
   Figure 1), and assign to each MN the one closest to its topological
   location [RFC4640], [RFC5026], [RFC6611].  In the example shown in
   Figure 1, MN1 is assigned HA1 (and a home address anchored by HA1),
   while MN2 is assigned HA2.  Note that current Mobile IPv6 / NEMO
   specifications do not allow the simultaneous use of multiple home
   agents by a single mobile node instance, and therefore the benefits
   of this deployment model shown here are limited (unless multiple
   MIPv6 MN instances are run in parallel, each of them associated to a
   different HA).  For example, if MN1 moves and attaches to AR3, the
   path followed by data packets would be suboptimal, as they have to
   traverse HA1, which is no longer close to the topological attachment
   point of MN1.

2.1.2.  Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization

   One of the main goals of DMM is to avoid the suboptimal routing
   caused by centralized anchoring.  By default, Mobile IPv6 and NEMO
   use the so-called Bidirectional Tunnel (BT) mode, in which data
   traffic is always encapsulated between the MN and its HA before being
   directed to any other destination.  Mobile IPv6 also specifies the
   Route Optimization (RO) mode, which allows the MN to update its
   current location on the CNs, and then use the direct path between
   them.  Using the example shown in Figure 1, MN1 is using BT mode with
   CN2 and MN2 is in RO mode with CN1.  However, the RO mode has several
   drawbacks:

   o  The RO mode is only supported by Mobile IPv6.  There is no route
      optimization support standardized for the NEMO protocol, although
      many different solutions have been proposed.

   o  The RO mode requires additional signaling, which adds some
      protocol overhead.

   o  The signaling required to enable RO involves the home agent, and
      it is repeated periodically because of security reasons [RFC4225].
      This basically means that the HA remains as single point of
      failure, because the Mobile IPv6 RO mode does not mean HA-less
      operation.

   o  The RO mode requires additional support on the correspondent node
      (CN).

   Notwithstanding these considerations, the RO mode does offer the
   possibility of substantially reducing traffic through the Home Agent,
   in cases when it can be supported on the relevant correspondent
   nodes.

                    Figure 2: Hierarchical Mobile IPv6

   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC5380] allows reducing the
   amount of mobility signaling as well as improving the overall
   handover performance of Mobile IPv6 by introducing a new hierarchy
   level to handle local mobility.  The Mobility Anchor Point (MAP)
   entity is introduced as a local mobility handling node deployed
   closer to the mobile node.

   When HMIPv6 is used, the MN has two different temporal addresses: the
   Regional Care-of Address (RCoA) and the Local Care-of Address (LCoA).
   The RCoA is anchored at one MAP, that plays the role of local home
   agent, while the LCoA is anchored at the access router level.  The
   mobile node uses the RCoA as the CoA signaled to its home agent.
   Therefore, while roaming within a local domain handled by the same
   MAP, the mobile node does not need to update its home agent (i.e.,

   the mobile node does not change RCoA).

   The use of HMIPv6 allows some route optimization, as a mobile node
   may decide to directly use the RCoA as source address for a
   communication with a given correspondent node, notably if the MN does
   not expect to move outside the local domain during the lifetime of
   the communication.  This can be seen as a potential DMM mode of
   operation.  In the example shown in Figure 2, MN1 is using its global
   HoA to communicate with CN1, while it is using its RCoA to
   communicate with CN2.

   Additionally, a local domain might have several MAPs deployed,
   enabling hence different kind of HMIPv6 deployments (e.g., flat and
   distributed).  The HMIPv6 specification supports a flexible selection
   of the MAP (e.g., based on the distance between the MN and the MAP,
   taking into consideration the expected mobility pattern of the MN,
   etc.).

2.1.4.  Home Agent switch

   The Home Agent switch specification [RFC5142] defines a new mobility
   header for signaling a mobile node that it should acquire a new home
   agent.  Although the purposes of this specification do not include
   the case of changing the mobile node's home address, as that might
   imply loss of connectivity for ongoing persistent connections, it
   could be used to force the change of home agent in those situations
   where there are no active persistent data sessions that cannot cope
   with a change of home address.

2.1.5.  IP Flow Mobility

   There are different specifications meant to support IP Flow Mobility
   (IFOM) with Mobile IPv6, namely the multiple care-of address
   registration [RFC5648], the flow bindings in Mobile IPv6 and NEMO
   [RFC6089] and the traffic selectors for flow bindings [RFC6088].  The
   use of these extensions allows a mobile node to associate different
   flows with different care-of addresses that the mobile owns at a
   given time.  This could also be used, combined with the route
   optimization support, to improve the paths followed by data packets,
   avoiding the traversal of the core network for selected flows.

2.1.6.  Source Address Selection

   The IPv6 socket API for source address selection [RFC5014], [RFC6724]
   can be used by an application running on a mobile node to express its
   preference of using a home address or a care-of address in a given
   connection.  This allows, for example, an application which can
   survive an IP address change to always prefer the use of a care-of

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis               December 2012


   address.  Similarly, and as mentioned in [RFC6275], a mobile node can
   also prefer the use of a care-of address for sessions that are going
   to finish before the mobile node hands off to a different attachment
   point (e.g., short-lived connections like DNS dialogs).  This could
   be based on user or operator policies, and it is typically performed
   by a connection manager (e.g., [I-D.seite-mif-cm]).

2.2.  Network-based IP mobility

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] is the main network-based IP
   mobility protocol specified for IPv6.  Architecturally, PMIPv6 is
   similar to MIPv6, as it relies on the function of the Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA) to provide mobile nodes with mobility support, without
   requiring the involvement of the mobile nodes.  The required
   functionality at the mobile node is provided in a proxy manner by the
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).  We next describe how network-based
   mobility protocols and several additional extensions can be deployed
   to meet some of the DMM requirements [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

           Figure 3: Distributed operation of Proxy Mobile IPv6

   As with Mobile IPv6, plain Proxy Mobile IPv6 operation cannot be
   easily decentralized, as in this case there also exists a single
   network anchor point.  One simple but still suboptimal approach,



Zuniga, et al.            Expires June 22, 2013                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis               December 2012


   would be to deploy several local mobility anchors and use a
   topological position-based assignment to attach mobile nodes (an
   example of this type of assignment is shown in Figure 3.  This
   assignment can be static or dynamic (as described in Section 2.2.3).
   The main advantage of this simple approach is that the IP address
   anchor (i.e., the LMA) is placed close to the mobile node, and
   therefore resulting paths are close-to-optimal.  On the other hand,
   as soon as the mobile node moves, the resulting path starts to
   deviate from the optimal one.

2.2.2.  Local Routing

   [RFC6705] enables optimal routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6 in three
   cases: i) when two communicating MNs are attached to the same MAG and
   LMA, ii) when two communicating MNs are attached to different MAGs
   but to the same LMA, and iii) when two communicating MNs are attached
   to the same MAG but have different LMAs.  In these three cases, data
   traffic between the two mobile nodes does not traverse the LMA(s),
   thus providing some form of path optimization since the traffic is
   locally routed at the edge.

   The main disadvantage of this approach is that it only tackles the
   MN-to-MN communication scenario, and only under certain
   circumstances.

   In the context of 3GPP, the closest analogy is the use of the X2
   interface between two eNBs to directly exchange data traffic during
   handover procedures. 3GPP does not foresee the use of local routing
   at any other point of the network given the structure of the EPS
   bearer model.

2.2.3.  LMA runtime assignment

   [RFC6463] specifies a runtime local mobility anchor assignment
   functionality and corresponding mobility options for Proxy Mobile
   IPv6.  This runtime local mobility anchor assignment takes place
   during the Proxy Binding Update / Proxy Binding Acknowledgment
   message exchange between a mobile access gateway and a local mobility
   anchor.  While this mechanism is mainly aimed for load-balancing
   purposes, it can also be used to select an optimal LMA from the
   routing point of view.  A runtime LMA assignment can be used to
   change the assigned LMA of an MN, for example in case when the mobile
   node does not have any session active, or when running sessions can
   survive an IP address change.

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis               December 2012


2.2.4.  Source Address Selection

   Also in the context of network-based mobility, the use of a source
   address selection API can be considered as means to achieve better
   routing (by using different anchors).  For instance, an MN connected
   to a PMIPv6 domain could attach two different wireless network
   interfaces to two different MAGs, hence configuring a different set
   of HNPs on both interfaces (potentially combining both IPv4 and
   IPv6).  Based on application requirements or operator's policies the
   connection manager logic could instruct the IP stack on the MN to
   route selected traffic on a specific wireless interface
   [I-D.seite-mif-cm].  It should be noted that source address selection
   mostly provides for better routing but not session continuity.

2.2.5.  Multihoming in PMIPv6

   PMIPv6 provides some multihoming support.  RFC 5213 specifies that
   the LMA can maintain one mobility session per attached interface and
   that upon handover the full set of HNPs can be moved to another
   interface in case of inter-technology handover (MAGs providing
   different wireless access technology) or maintained on the same
   interface in case of intra-technology handover (MAGs providing the
   same wireless access technology).  An MN can also attach two
   different interfaces to the same PMIPv6 domain (as described in
   Section 2.2.4), hence resulting in a multihomed device being able to
   send/receive traffic sequentially or simultaneously from both network
   interfaces.  [I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob] extends the base
   RFC5213 capabilities so that a mobility session can be shared across
   two different access networks.  It derives that a selected flow could
   be routed through different paths, hence achieving some sort of
   better routing.  Yet all the traffic is anchored at centralized
   anchor points.

2.3.  3GPP mobility

   Architecturally, the 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network is also
   similar to PMIPv6 and MIPv6, as it relies on the Packet Data Gateway
   (PGW) anchoring services to provide mobile nodes with mobility
   support (see Figure 4).  There are client-based and network-based
   mobility solutions in 3GPP, which for simplicity we will analyze
   together.  We next describe how 3GPP mobility protocols and several
   additional completed or on-going extensions can be deployed to meet
   some of the DMM requirements.  [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

2.3.1.  GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) and DSMIPv6

   GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) [3GPP.29.060] is a network-based
   mobility protocol specified for 3GPP networks (S2a, S2b, S5 and S8
   interfaces).  Similar to PMIPv6, it can handle mobility without
   requiring the involvement of the mobile nodes.  In this case, the
   mobile node functionality is provided in a proxy manner by the
   Serving Data Gateway (SGW), Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG), or
   Trusted Wireless Access Gateway (TWAG).

   3GPP specifications also include client-based mobility support, based
   on adopting the use of Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6) [RFC5555] for



Zuniga, et al.            Expires June 22, 2013                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis               December 2012


   the S2c interface.  In this case, the UE implements the mobile node
   functionality, while the home agent role is played by the PGW.

2.3.2.  Local IP Access and Selected IP Traffic Offload (LIPA-SIPTO)

   A Local IP Access (LIPA) and Selected IP Traffic Offload (SIPTO)
   enabled network [3GPP.23.829] allows offloading some IP services at
   the local access network, above the Radio Access Network (RAN) or at
   the macro, without the need to traverse back to the PGW.

   Similarly to the runtime local mobility anchor assignment described
   in Section 2.2.3, considerations have been discussed in 3GPP with
   respect to SIPTO.  SIPTO enables an operator to offload certain types
   of traffic at a network node close to the UE's point of attachment to
   the access network, by selecting a set of GWs (SGW and PGW) that is
   geographically/topologically close to the UE's point of attachment.

   LIPA, on the other hand, enables an IP capable UE connected via a
   Home eNB (HeNB) to access other IP capable entities in the same
   residential/enterprise IP network without the user plane traversing
   the mobile operator's network core.  In order to achieve this, a
   Local GW (L-GW) collocated with the HeNB is used.  LIPA is
   established by the UE requesting a new PDN connection to an access
   point name for which LIPA is permitted, and the network selecting the
   Local GW associated with the HeNB and enabling a direct user plane
   path between the Local GW and the HeNB.

2.3.3.  LIPA Mobility and SIPTO at the Local Network (LIMONET)

   Both SIPTO and LIPA have a very limited mobility support, specially
   in 3GPP specifications up to Rel-10.  In Rel-11, there is currently a
   work item on LIPA Mobility and SIPTO at the Local Network (LIMONET)
   [3GPP.23.859] that is studying how to provide SIPTO and LIPA
   mechanisms with some additional, but still limited, mobility support.
   In a glimpse, LIPA mobility support is limited to handovers between
   HeNBs that are managed by the same L-GW (i.e., mobility within the
   local domain), while seamless SIPTO mobility is still limited to the
   case where the SGW/PGW is at or above Radio Access Network (RAN)
   level.

2.3.4.  Data IDentification in ANDSF (DIDA) and Operator Policies for IP
        Interface Selection (OPIIS)

   There are two ongoing work items in 3GPP that are currently
   addressing the issue of selecting a wireless interface or an IP
   address for a specific data application.  The work item DIDA (Data
   IDentification in ANDSF) is addressing the need to map an application
   ID to a specific wireless interface, while the work item Operator

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis               December 2012


   Policies for IP Interface Selection (OPIIS) is addressing the need of
   selecting the right APN for a given application.

   Taking into account that there is a one to one link between APN and
   PDN connection (i.e., IP address) these work items clearly address
   from a 3GPP perspective the same problem space as [RFC6724], and the
   same considerations described in Section 2.2.4 apply here as well.

2.3.5.  Multi-Access PDN Connectivity (MAPCON)

   The Multi-Access PDN Connectivity (MAPCON) feature addresses the use
   of multiple PDN connections.  Hence, this feature can make use of
   multiple wireless interfaces either sequentially or simultaneously.


3.  Gap Analysis: limitations in current practices

   This section identifies the limitations in the current practices
   (documented in Section 2) with respect to the requirements listed in
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   The analysis is divided in three parts: IP client-based mobility, IP
   network-based mobility, and 3GPP mobility solutions.  Each part
   analyzes how well the requirements listed in
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements] are covered/met by the current practices,
   highlighting existing limitations and gaps.

3.1.  Client-based IP mobility

3.1.1.  REQ1: Distributed deployment

   MIPv6 / NEMO  A careful home agent deployment and policy
      configuration of the Mobile IPv6 / NEMO protocols can achieve some
      distribution.  However, as soon as the mobile node moves and
      changes its initial attachment point, the anchors are no longer
      placed optimally, incurring in sub-optimal routes.  This situation
      may be acceptable as long as the session is short-lived.  If the
      mobile node is not expected to move within a limited area, this
      configuration might be considered sufficient.  Otherwise,
      additional mechanisms to support dynamic anchoring would be
      needed.  Note that a possible solution would be to run multiple
      instances of mobile IPv6 at the mobile node, each one managing a
      different HoA and bound to a different home agent.  This would
      require, though, additional intelligence at the mobile node to be
      able to optimally select and manage source IP addresses for each
      session.

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis               December 2012


   Mobile IPv6 RO  The use of route optimization support enables a
      close-to anchor-less operation, which effectively can be
      considered as a fully distributed configuration.  However, as
      explained before in this document, the home agent is still used
      for the signaling and therefore remains as a critical centralized
      component.  Additionally, there is no standardized RO support for
      network mobility.

   HMIPv6  The use of hierarchical mobile IPv6 can be seen as a step
      forward compared to a careful deployment of multiple home agents
      and its proper configuration, as it allows a mobile node to roam
      within a local domain, reducing the handover latency as well as
      the signaling overhead.  If used together with mobile IPv6,
      traffic still has to traverse the centralized home agent, and
      therefore no distributed operation is achieved.

   HA switch  The home agent switch specification can be used to enable
      obtaining more benefits from a multiple-HA deployment, as the
      mobile node could be instructed to switch to a closer home agent.
      To avoid packet loss, this switch must be performed at periods of
      time in which the mobile node does not have any active connection
      running.  Even if some packet loss were acceptable for active
      sessions, the change of home address would also require the mobile
      node to re-establish those sessions.

   Flow mobility  Considerations made for previous scenarios (e.g. for
      Route Optimization) could also apply here, extending those
      scenarios by the use of multiple attached interfaces.

   SA selection API  The use of proper source address selection
      decisions, enabled by smart connection managers
      [I-D.seite-mif-cm], or mobility aware applications using a
      selection API [RFC5014], [RFC6724], would allow the mobile node to
      realize substantial benefits from deployments providing multiple
      anchors.

3.1.2.  REQ2: Transparency to Upper Layers when needed

   MIPv6 / NEMO  As a mobility protocol, the solution is transparent to
      the upper layers.  However, as described before, this transparency
      comes with the cost of suboptimal routes if the MN moves away from
      its initial attachment point.

   Mobile IPv6 RO  The use of the route optimization support is
      transparent to the upper layers.






Zuniga, et al.            Expires June 22, 2013                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft              DMM Gap Analysis               December 2012


   HMIPv6  The use of HMIPv6 is transparent to the upper layers.

   HA switch  The use of the home agent switch functionality is not
      transparent to the upper layers, as a change of home agent
      normally implies a change of home address.  Therefore, the home
      agent can only be switched when there is no active session running
      on the mobile node.  Since IP address continuity cannot be
      achieved at the relocated home agents, one gap that would need to
      be filled is the ability for the mobile node to convey HoA context
      from the previous home agent.

   Flow mobility  The use of flow mobility mechanisms is transparent to
      the upper layers.

   SA selection API  The use of an intelligent source address mechanisms
      is transparent to the upper layers if performed by the connection
      manager.  However if the selection is performed by the
      applications themselves, via the use of the API, then applications
      have to be mobility-aware.

3.1.3.  REQ3: IPv6 deployment

   MIPv6 / NEMO  Mobile IPv6 / NEMO protocols primarily support IPv6,
      although there are some extensions defined to also offer some IPv4
      support [RFC5555].

   Mobile IPv6 RO  Route optimization only supports IPv6.

   HMIPv6  HMIPv6 is only defined for IPv6.

   HA switch  The home agent switch specification supports only IPv6,
      although the use of the defined mechanisms to support dual stack
      IPv4/IPv6 mobile nodes would also enable some IPv4 support.

   Flow mobility  Flow mobility is only defined for IPv6.

   SA selection API  The use of source address selection mechanisms
      supports both IPv6 and IPv4.

3.1.4.  REQ4: Existing mobility protocols

   MIPv6 / NEMO  These approaches are ones of the base IETF-standardized
      mobility protocols: [RFC6275] and [RFC3963].

   Mobile IPv6 RO  This approach is based on an existing protocol
      [RFC6275].

   HA switch  This approach is based on an existing protocol [RFC5142].

   Flow mobility  This approach is based on existing protocols
      [RFC5648], [RFC6089] and [RFC6088].

   SA selection API  This approach is based on existing protocols
      [RFC6724] and [RFC5014].

3.1.5.  REQ5: Compatibility

   MIPv6 / NEMO  This approach would be compatible with other protocols
      and work between trusted administrative domains, although as
      described before its operation would not provide the benefits of a
      fully distributed mechanism.  The combination of different IP
      mobility protocols might have a performance/complexity cost
      associated, as described in [A. de la Oliva, et al.].

   Mobile IPv6 RO  This approach would be compatible with other
      protocols and work between trusted administrative domains, as long
      as mobile IPv6 is allowed.  However, as highlighted before, mobile
      IPv6 route optimization requires specific support at the
      correspondent nodes.

   HMIPv6  HMIPv6 is compatible with other protocols.

   HA switch  This approach would be compatible with other protocols and
      work between trusted administrative domains.

   Flow mobility  This approach would be compatible with other protocols
      and work between trusted administrative domains.

      compatibility or use between trusted administrative domains.

   Flow mobility  This approach includes security considerations.

   SA selection API  This approach does not have security issues.

3.2.  Network-based IP mobility

3.2.1.  REQ1: Distributed deployment

   PMIPv6  As for the case of MIPv6, a careful deployment of the local
      mobility anchors and policy configuration of the Proxy Mobile IPv6
      protocol can achieve some distribution.  However, as soon as the
      mobile node moves and changes its initial attachment point, the
      anchor is no longer placed optimally, incurring in sub-optimal
      routes, which might be quite noticeable in case of medium to large
      PMIPv6 domains.  If the mobile node movement is restricted to a
      well known limited area and/or the PMIPv6 domain is not large,
      this configuration might be considered sufficient.  Otherwise,
      additional mechanisms to support dynamic anchoring would be
      needed.

   Local Routing  As mentioned before, it enables optimal routing in
      three cases: the LMA manages the traffic of two mobile nodes
      connected to the same MAG, the LMA manages the traffic of two
      mobile nodes connected to different MAGs, the MAG manages the
      traffic of two mobile nodes connected to different LMAs.  LR does
      not consider the case where the traffic should be optimized
      considering different MAGs and different LMAs.  Inter LMA
      communication is not in scope.  LR only enables better routing and
      does not consider the distribution of mobility anchors as such.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  The LMA runtime assignment is used to
      allocate an optimal LMA mostly for load balancing purposes, for
      instance in scenarios where LMAs run in a datacenter-like
      infrastructure.  It can be used to allocate a different LMA based
      on other policies such as routing, although it is not clear how
      the technology can be used to achieve distributed mobility
      management, especially considering scalability issues.  There are
      different gaps that would prevent using this mechanism as a way to
      meet all the DMM requirements: i) LMA runtime assignment can only
      performed at the MN's attachment, so it would need to be extended
      to allow LMA re-location at any time; ii) LMA runtime assignment
      can only be initiated by current LMA; iii) it is not in the scope
      of the specification how the context is transferred between the
      involved LMAs.

   Source Address Selection  It can help in selecting a given IP source
      address although the current specifications have many limitations
      (for instance prefer IPv6 over IPv4, prefer HoA instead of CoA)
      and the socket extensions [RFC5014] require changes in the node.
      This solution alone is not sufficient to achieve anchors
      distribution in case of session continuity requirements, as some
      control logic (e.g., from a connection manager [I-D.seite-mif-cm])
      is needed to intelligently perform source address selection.

   Multihoming in PMIPv6  As summarized in the previous section a single
      mobility session belongs to a single LMA (at the most the same
      mobility session is shared across two access networks).  As of
      today there is no possibility to distribute anchors and to move
      the session between different LMAs.

3.2.2.  REQ2: Transparency to Upper Layers when needed

   PMIPv6  As a mobility protocol, the solution provides transparent
      mobility support for a mobile node while roaming within the PMIPv6
      domain (e.g., if a mobile node moves outside the domain,
      established sessions cannot be maintained, unless the MN
      implements Mobile IPv6).  However, as for the MIPv6 case, this
      transparent mobility support comes with the cost of suboptimal
      routes if the MN moves away from its initial attachment point,
      especially in large PMIPv6 domains.

   Local Routing  During HO the standard mechanisms are used.  In this
      sense if there is a MAG change while LR is enabled signaling is
      exchanged to inform the target MAG that upon handover LR should be
      re-established.  The inter LMA case is not supported.  For this
      solution the mobility context is always up, all the traffic
      receive seamless service.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  Seamless support is provided as per RFC 5213.
      Since the LMA cannot be changed at runtime, the solution provides
      transparency to the upper layers.  However, if the solution were
      extended to allow dynamic LMA re-location, some extensions would
      be needed to provide IP address continuity.

   Source Address Selection  No seamless support is currently provided,
      since it requires solutions such as IP flow mobility for PMIPv6
      [I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob].

   Multihoming in PMIPv6  Seamless support falls back to standard PMIPv6
      operations extended for IP flow mobility support.  For this
      solution the mobility context is always up, all the traffic
      receive seamless service.

3.2.3.  REQ3: IPv6 deployment

   PMIPv6  Although Proxy Mobile IPv6 primarily support IPv6, there are
      also extensions defined to also offer some limited IPv4 support
      [RFC5844].

   Local Routing  It supports both IPv4 (limited to the support provided
      by [RFC5844]) and IPv6.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  It supports both IPv4 (limited to the support
      provided by [RFC5844]) and IPv6.

   Source Address Selection  It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

   Multihoming in PMIPv6  It supports both IPv4 (limited to the support
      provided by [RFC5844]) and IPv6.

3.2.4.  REQ4: Existing mobility protocols

   PMIPv6  This approach is one of the base IETF-standardized mobility
      protocols: [RFC5213].

   Local Routing  It reuses [RFC5213].

   LMA Runtime Assignment  It reuses [RFC5213].

   Source Address Selection  This approach is based on local support on
      the terminal only.

3.2.5.  REQ5: Compatibility

   PMIPv6  This protocol is compatible with other protocols and can
      operate between trusted administrative domains, although there may
      be an associated penalty in terms of performance and/or complexity
      [A. de la Oliva, et al.].

   Local Routing  Since it extends [RFC5213], compatibility with
      existing network deployments and end hosts is provided.

   LMA Runtime Assignment  Since it extends [RFC5213], compatibility
      with existing network deployments and end hosts is provided.

   Source Address Selection  To enable the full set of use cases
      mentioned above extensions are required thus impacting the
      landscape of mobile devices.  The extensions should not impact the
      network.

3.3.  3GPP mobility

3.3.1.  REQ1: Distributed deployment

   SIPTO enables a certain degree of distribution, as SGW/PGW can be
   selected to be the closest geographically to the UE.  This, together
   with the use of OPIIS (and MAPCON for the case the UE is using
   multiple interfaces), could be used to allow the use of different
   anchors as the UE moves.  However, as described below, there is no
   support for dynamically changing the anchor while providing IP
   address continuity, which might be OK for short-lived sessions.

3.3.2.  REQ2: Transparency to Upper Layers when needed

   Seamless mobility at the local network is still not considered in
   SIPTO.  Therefore, although SIPTO and LIPA allow offloading traffic
   from the network core similarly to the DMM approaches, even with
   LIMONET they just provide localized mobility support, requiring
   packet data network connections to be deactivated and re-activated
   when the UE is not moving locally.

3.3.3.  REQ3: IPv6 deployment

   3GPP specs support IPv6 as described in [RFC6459].

3.3.4.  REQ4: Existing mobility protocols

   Current 3GPP specifications make use of both IETF standardized
   mechanisms (e.g., PMIPv6, DSMIPv6), and custom made mechanisms, such

3.3.5.  REQ5: Compatibility

   All the 3GPP extensions listed in this document are compatible with
   3GPP networks, at least for the same release these extensions are
   introduced or newer ones.

3.3.6.  REQ6: Security considerations

   3GPP extensions are assumed to be secure.  TBD: refine (possibly
   extending) this section.


4.  Conclusions

   In this section we identify the gaps between existing mobility
   solutions and the DMM requirements and expected functionalities.  We
   first summarize the identified IP-mobility protocols and provide a
   mapping (e.g., YES, NO, LIMITED) to the different DMM requirements
   listed in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].  Following the independent
   analysis, a comparison between the solutions and the main DMM
   functionalities is provided.  Finally, the possibility of using
   multiple solutions is addressed by combining different solutions
   according to the results found in the independent and functional
   analysis.

4.2.  Functional analysis

   The goal of this section is to identify and analyze the main
   functions that a DMM solution should provide in order to meet the DMM
   requirements [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].  This analysis is on
   purpose kept at high level, and will be used in the following section
   as main guideline for the final assessment of the gaps that cannot be
   covered with existing specified and deployed solutions (even if
   combined).

4.2.1.  Multiple anchoring

   Multiple (distributed) anchoring refers to the ability to anchor
   different sessions of a single mobile node at different anchors.  In
   order to make this feature "DMM-friendly", some anchors should be
   placed closer to the mobile node.  This implies the ability to deploy
   routers and assign locally anchored IP addresses at the edge of the
   network.  This feature also requires potentially assigning multiple
   IP addresses to a single mobile node for its simultaneous use.

   Figure 5 shows an example of the multiple anchoring function, in
   which a mobile network operator (MNO) has deployed multiple anchors,
   placed closer to or at the access network level.  These (distributed)
   anchors provide attaching terminals with IP addresses that are
   locally anchored, allowing MNs' traffic (Internet and operator
   services) to be locally offloaded (i.e., not traversing the MNO's
   core).

4.2.2.  Dynamic anchor assignment

   Dynamic anchor re-location is the ability to i) optimally assign
   initial anchor, and ii) change the initially assigned anchor and/or
   assign a new one.  This can be achieved either by changing anchor for
   all ongoing sessions (which might only be achievable with routing-
   based solutions), or by assigning new anchors for new sessions.

   Figure 6 shows an example of what the dynamic anchor assignment
   function provides.  A mobile node MN1, initially attached to the
   distributed anchor 1, establishes a session X (anchored at 1, i.e.,
   optimal initial anchor assignment), which finishes before MN1 moves
   to the distributed anchor i.  While connected to the distributed
   anchor i, a new session Y is established, which is anchored at i
   (i.e. assignment of a new anchor).  Then MN1 moves and attaches to
   the distributed anchor n, while having session Y active, where MN1 is
   assigned n as its anchor for new sessions and (optionally) existing
   sessions are moved (i.e., change of assigned anchor).

4.2.3.  Multiple address management

   Multiple IP address management refers to the ability of the mobile
   node to simultaneously use multiple IP addresses and select the best
   one (from an anchoring point of view) to use on a per-session/
   application/service basis.  Depending on the mobile node support,
   this functionality might require more or less support from the
   network side.

   Figure 7 shows an example of multiple address management, in which
   MN1 initially obtained an IP address (IP a) when connected to the
   distributed anchor 1, which is then used for a session which remains
   active after MN1 moves and attaches to the distributed anchor i.  MN1
   also obtains a new IP address (IP b) to be used for sessions

   initiated while attached to i.  MN1 therefore needs to simultaneously
   manage and use multiple IP addresses, selecting the best one for each
   session.  This selection might be performed by the mobile node solely
   or might be aided/performed with network support.

4.3.  Combined solutions analysis

   The goal of this section is to evaluate how a solution based on
   combining the different standardized IP mobility solutions could meet
   the DMM requirements, making reference to the high-level functions
   identified above.

   Both the main client- and network-based IP mobility protocols, namely
   (DS)MIPv6 and PMIPv6 allows to deploy multiple anchors (i.e., home
   agents and localized mobility anchors), therefore providing the
   functionality of multiple anchoring.  However, existing solutions
   does only provide an optimal initial anchor assignment, a gap being
   the lack of dynamic anchor change/new anchor assignment.  Neither the
   HA switch nor the LMA runtime assignment allow changing the anchor
   during an ongoing session.

   Even if dynamic anchor change and new anchor assignment were
   supported, default address selection mechanisms would need to be
   improved, as mobile nodes would likely be assigned multiple IP
   addresses, anchored at different places.  Therefore, smart address

   selection, trying to always use the shortest path, would be required.


5.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations.


6.  Security Considerations

   This is an informational document that analyzes practices for the
   deployment of existing mobility protocols in a distributed mobility
   management environment, and identifies the limitations in the current
   practices.  One of the requirements that these practices has to meet
   is to take into account security aspects, including confidentiality
   and integrity.  This is briefly analyzed for each of the considered
   practices, and will be extended in future versions of this document.
