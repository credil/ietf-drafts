                 Formally Deprecating some IPv4 Options
             draft-gp-intarea-obsolete-ipv4-options-iana-01

Abstract

   A number of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have
   never been formally deprecated.  This document deprecates such IPv4
   options, thus cleaning up the corresponding IANA registry, and
   serving as a basis for providing advice about the filtering of
   packets containing these options.  Additionally, it requests that the
   status of the corresponding RFCs be changed to "Historic".

Internet-Draft        Deprecating some IPv4 Options            July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) [RFC0791] provides for
   expansion of the protocol by supporting a number of "options" in the
   variable-length IPv4 header.  IPv4 options are identified by an
   option "type" value, whose registration is managed by IANA [IANA-IP].
   A number of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have
   never been formally deprecated.  This document deprecates such IPv4
   options, "cleaning up" the corresponding IANA registry.


2.  Discussion of Deprecated Options

   The following subsections discuss the details of options being
   deprecated, and no other reference information has been found.

2.1.  Stream ID

   The Stream ID option is obsolete.  It is specified in RFC 791
   [RFC0791], and deprecated in Section 3.2.1.8 of RFC 1122 [RFC1122]
   and Section 4.2.2.1 of RFC 1812 [RFC1812].

2.2.  Extended Internet Protocol

   The Extended Internet Protocol option is defined in [RFC1385], and is
   superseded by [RFC2460].

2.3.  Traceroute

   The Traceroute option is defined in [RFC1393].  The Traceroute option
   is defined as "experimental" and it was never widely deployed on the
   public Internet.

2.4.  ENCODE

   This option was used for experimentation around IP-layer encryption.
   No products are known to ever have shipped with support for this
   option.

2.5.  VISA

   This option was part of an experiment [VISA87] [VISA89] at USC and
   was never widely deployed.

2.6.  Address Extension

   The Address Extension option is defined in the Experimental
   [RFC1475], and marked as IPv7.

2.7.  Selective Directed Broadcast

   The Selective Directed Broadcast option is originally defined in
   [RFC1770].

2.8.  Dynamic Packet State

   The Dynamic Packet State option was specified in
   [I-D.stoica-diffserv-dps].  The aforementioned document was meant to
   be published as "Experimental", but never became an RFC.

2.9.  Upstream Multicast Pkt.

   This option was originally specified in [draft-farinacci-bidir-pim].
   Its use was deprecated by [RFC5015], which employs a control plane
   mechanism to solve the problem of doing upstream forwarding of
   multicast packets on a multi-access LAN.


3.  IANA Considerations

   The "IP OPTION NUMBERS" registry [IANA-IP] contains the list of the
   currently assigned IP option numbers.  This registry also denotes an
   deprecated IP Option Number by marking it with a single asterisk
   ("*").

   This document formally deprecates the following options, and requests
   IANA to mark them as such in the corresponding registry [IANA-IP].

   Copy Class Number Value Name                               Reference
   ---- ----- ------ ----- ------------------------------- ------------
      1     0      8   136 SID    - Stream ID              [RFC791,JBP]*
      1     0     14   142 VISA   - Expermental Access Control [Estrin]*
      0     0     15    15 ENCODE - ???                      [VerSteeg]*
      1     0     17   145 EIP    - Extended Internet Protocol[RFC1385]*
      0     2     18    82 TR     - Traceroute                [RFC1393]*
      1     0     19   147 ADDEXT - Address Extension    [Ullmann IPv7]*
      1     0     21   149 SDB    - Selective Directed Broadcast[Graff]*
      1     0     23   151 DPS    - Dynamic Packet State        [Malis]*
      1     0     24   152 UMP    - Upstream Multicast Pkt. [Farinacci]*


   The IP Options "MTU Probe" (MTUP, value 11) and "MTU Reply" (MTUR,
   value 12) initially defined in [RFC1063] have already been deprecated
   by [RFC1191].

4.  Changing the status of the corresponding RFCs to Historic

   This document requests the RFC Editor to change the status of
   [RFC1385] and [RFC1393] to "Historic".


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not modify the security properties of the IPv4
   Options being deprecated.  However, formally deprecating these
   options serves as a basis for e.g. providing advice about filtering
   packets containing these options (as in
   [I-D.ietf-opsec-ip-options-filtering]).


6.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Ron Bonica for his guidance.

   The authors would like to thank Ran Atkinson, Fred Baker, Deborah
   Estrin, Dino Farinacci, Andrew Malis, Gene Tsudik, and Bill VerSteeg
   for providing insights on some of the options being formally
   deprecated by this document.
