Abstract


   E-VPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP
   network. However, there are scenarios in which inter-subnet
   forwarding among hosts/VMs across different IP subnets is required,
   while maintaining the multi-homing capabilities of E-VPN. This
   document describes an IRB solution based on E-VPN to address such
   requirements.

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN   October 22, 2012


1  Introduction

   E-VPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP
   network. However, there are scenarios where, in addition to intra-
   subnet forwarding, inter-subnet forwarding is required among
   hosts/VMs across different IP subnets, while maintaining the multi-
   homing capabilities of E-VPN. This document describes an IRB solution
   based on E-VPN to address such requirements.

2  Inter-Subnet Forwarding Scenarios 

   The inter-subnet forwarding scenarios for E-VPN can be divided into
   six categories. The first two scenarios, along with their
   corresponding solutions, are described in [EVPN-IPVPN-INTEROP]. The
   solutions for scenarios 3 through 6 are the focus of this document. 

   1. Connecting IP-VPN sites and E-VPN NVEs without route aggregation
   2. Connecting IP-VPN NVEs and E-VPN NVEs without route aggregation
   3. Connecting E-VPN NVEs within a DC
   4. Connecting E-VPN NVEs in different DCs without route aggregation
   5. Connecting E-VPN NVEs in different DCs with route aggregation
   6. Connecting IP-VPN sites and E-VPN NVEs with route aggregation

   In the above scenarios, the term "route aggregation" refers to the
   case where a node situated at the edge of the data center network
   behaves as a default gateway for all VM addresses that are unknown to
   the data center switches. Effectively, this WAN edge switch
   implements a gateway functionality. The absence of route aggregation
   refers to the scenario where all data center switches are aware of
   all VM addresses (in a given EVI/VRF context), for both VMs in the
   local as well as remote data centers.

                  Figure 2: Interoperability Use-Cases

   In what follows, we will describe scenarios 3 through 6 in more
   detail.

2.1 Connecting E-VPN NVEs within a DC

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between hosts (e.g. VMs)
   in the same data center, and those hosts belong to different IP
   subnets. Each subnet is associated with a single EVI on the NVEs.
   Furthermore, all the EVIs in question belong to the same VRF.

   As an example, consider VM3 and VM5 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two VMs where VM3 belongs to
   the IP3 subnet whereas VM5 belongs to the IP5 subnet. NVE2 has an
   EVI3 associated with IP3 subnet and NVE3 has an EVI5 associated with
   the IP5 subnet. Both EVI3 and EVI5 are associated with the same VRFa.

2.2 Connecting E-VPN NVEs in different DCs without route aggregation

   This case is similar to that of section 2.1 above albeit for the fact
   that the hosts belong to different data centers that are
   interconnected over a WAN (e.g. MPLS/IP PSN). The data centers in
   question here are seamlessly interconnected to the WAN, i.e. no
   gateways are used on the data center WAN edge.

   As an example, consider VM3 and VM6 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two VMs where VM3 belongs to
   the IP3 subnet whereas VM6 belongs to the IP6 subnet. NVE2 has an
   EVI3 associated with IP3 subnet and NVE4 has an EVI6 associated with
   the IP6 subnet. Both EVI3 and EVI6 are associated with the same VRFa.

2.3 Connecting E-VPN NVEs in different DCs with route aggregation

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between hosts (e.g. VMs)
   in different data centers, and those hosts belong to different IP
   subnets. What makes this case different from that of Section 2.2 is
   that at least one of the data centers in question has a gateway as
   the WAN edge switch. Because of that, the NVEs in the data centers
   with gateways do not have the addresses of the hosts situated in
   remote data centers.

   As an example, consider VM1 and VM5 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two VMs where VM1 belongs to
   the IP1 subnet whereas VM5 belongs to the IP5 subnet. NVE3 has an
   EVI5 associated with the IP5 subnet and NVE1 has an EVI1 associated
   with the IP1 subnet. Both EVI1 and EVI5 are associated with the same
   VRFa. Due to the gateway at the edge of DCN 1, NVE1 does not have the
   address of VM5 in its VRFa table.

2.4 Connecting IP-VPN sites and E-VPN NVEs with route aggregation

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between hosts (e.g. VMs)
   in a data center and hosts in an enterprise site connected through
   IP-VPN. The NVE within the data center is an E-VPN NVE, whereas the
   NVE in the enterprise site is an IP-VPN NVE. Furthermore, the data
   center in question has a gateway as the WAN edge switch. Because of
   that, the NVE in the data center does not have the addresses of the
   hosts situated in the enterprise site.

   As an example, consider end-station H1 and VM2 of Figure 2. Assume
   that connectivity is required between the end-station and the VM,
   where VM2 belongs to the IP2 subnet whereas H1 belongs to the IP1
   subnet. NVE1 has and EVI2 associated with the IP2 subnet. EVI2 is
   associated with VRFa. On IP-VPN PE1, the IP1 subnet is in VRFa as
   well.  Due to the gateway at the edge of DCN 1, NVE1 does not have
   the address of H1 in its VRFa table.

4  Operational Models for Inter-Subnet Forwarding

4.1 Among E-VPN NVEs within a DC

   When an E-VPN MAC advertisement route is received by the NVE, the IP
   address associated with the route is used to populate the  VRF,
   whereas the MAC address associated with the route is used to populate
   both the bridge-domain MAC table, as well as the adjacency associated
   with the IP route in the VRF. 

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated EVI. If the
   MAC address corresponds to its IRB Interface MAC address, the ingress
   NVE deduces that the packet must be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the
   ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the associated VRF table. The
   lookup identifies both the next-hop (i.e. egress) NVE to which the
   packet must be forwarded, in addition to an adjacency that contains a
   MAC rewrite and an MPLS label stack. The MAC rewrite holds the MAC
   address associated with the destination host (as populated by the E-
   VPN MAC route), instead of the MAC address of the next-hop NVE. The
   ingress NVE then rewrites the destination MAC address in the packet
   with the address specified in the adjacency. It also rewrites the
   source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address. The ingress
   NVE, then, forwards the frame to the next-hop (i.e. egress) NVE after
   encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. Note that this label
   stack includes the LSP label as well as the EVI label that was
   advertised by the egress NVE. When the MPLS encapsulated packet is
   received by the egress NVE, it uses the EVI label to identify the
   bridge-domain table. It then performs a MAC lookup in that table,
   which yields the outbound interface to which the Ethernet frame must
   be forwarded. Figure 2 below depicts the packet flow, where NVE1 and
   NVE2 are the ingress and egress NVEs, respectively.

   VPN intra-subnet forwarding. In other words, all the packet
   processing associated with the inter-subnet forwarding semantics is
   confined to the ingress NVE.

   It should also be noted that [E-VPN] provides different level of
   granularity for the EVI label.  Besides identifying bridge domain
   table, it can be used to identify the egress interface or a
   destination MAC address on that interface. If EVI label is used for
   egress interface or destination MAC address identification, then no
   MAC lookup is needed in the egress EVI and the packet can be directly
   forwarded to the egress interface just based on EVI label lookup. 

4.2 Among E-VPN NVEs in Different DCs Without Route Aggregation

   [This section will be expanded in the future revision].

4.3 Among E-VPN NVEs in Different DCs with Route Aggregation

   In this scenario, the NVEs within a given data center do not have
   entries for the MAC/IP addresses of hosts in remote data centers.
   Rather, the NVEs have a default IP route pointing to the WAN gateway
   for each VRF. This is accomplished by the WAN gateway advertising for
   a given E-VPN that spans multiple DC a default VPN-IP route that is
   imported by the NVEs of that E-VPN that are in the gateway's own DC.

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated EVI. If the
   MAC address corresponds to the IRB Interface MAC address, the ingress
   NVE deduces that the packet must be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the
   ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the associated VRF table. The
   lookup, in this case, matches the default route which points to the
   local WAN gateway. The ingress NVE then rewrites the destination MAC
   address in the packet with the IRB Interface MAC address of the local
   WAN gateway. It also rewrites the source MAC address with its own IRB
   Interface MAC address. The ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to
   the WAN gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack.
   Note that this label stack includes the LSP label as well as the IP-
   VPN label that was advertised by the local WAN gateway. When the MPLS
   encapsulated packet is received by the local WAN gateway, it uses the
   IP-VPN label to identify the VRF table. It then performs an IP lookup
   in that table. The lookup identifies both the remote WAN gateway (of
   the remote data center) to which the packet must be forwarded, in
   addition to an adjacency that contains a MAC rewrite and an MPLS
   label stack. The MAC rewrite holds the MAC address associated with
   the ultimate destination host (as populated by the E-VPN MAC route).
   The local WAN gateway then rewrites the destination MAC address in
   the packet with the address specified in the adjacency. It also
   rewrites the source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address.

   The local WAN gateway, then, forwards the frame to the remote WAN
   gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. Note that
   this label stack includes the LSP label as well as a VPN label that
   was advertised by the remote WAN gateway. When the MPLS encapsulated
   packet is received by the remote WAN gateway, it simply swaps the VPN
   label with the EVI label advertised by the egress NVE. This implies
   that the remote WAN gateway must allocate the VPN label at least at
   the granularity of a (VRF, egress NVE) tuple. The remote WAN gateway
   then forward the packet to the egress NVE. The egress NVE then
   performs a MAC lookup in the EVI (identified by the received EVI
   label) to determine the outbound port to send the traffic on.

4.4 Among IP-VPN Sites and E-VPN NVEs with Route Aggregation

   In this scenario, the NVEs within a given data center do not have
   entries for the IP addresses of hosts in remote enterprise sites.
   Rather, the NVEs have a default IP route pointing to the WAN gateway
   for each VRF.

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated EVI. If the
   MAC address corresponds to the IRB Interface MAC address, the ingress
   NVE deduces that the packet must be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the

   address in the packet with the IRB Interface MAC address of the local
   WAN gateway. It also rewrites the source MAC address with its own IRB
   Interface MAC address. The ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to
   the WAN gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack.
   Note that this label stack includes the LSP label as well as the IP-

   VPN label that was advertised by the local WAN gateway. When the MPLS
   encapsulated packet is received by the local WAN gateway, it uses the
   IP-VPN label to identify the VRF table. It then performs an IP lookup
   in that table. The lookup identifies the next hop ASBR to which the
   packet must be forwarded. The local gateway in this case strips the
   Ethernet encapsulation and forwards the IP packet to the ASBR using a
   label stack comprising of an LSP label and a VPN label that was
   advertised by the ASBR. When the MPLS encapsulated packet is received
   by the ASBR, it simply swaps the VPN label with the IP-VPN label
   advertised by the egress PE. This implies that the remote WAN gateway
   must allocate the VPN label at least at the granularity of a (VRF,
   egress PE) tuple. The ASBR then forwards the packet to the egress PE.
   The egress PE then performs an IP lookup in the VRF (identified by
   the received IP-VPN label) to determine where to forward the traffic.

   Figure 5 below depicts the forwarding model.
