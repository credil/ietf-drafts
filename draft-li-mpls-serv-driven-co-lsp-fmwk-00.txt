Internet-Draft      A Framework for SD Co-Routed LSPs       October 2012


1.  Introduction

   MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) has been widely deployed to support
   packet-based services.  Rich Traffic Engineering properties can be
   provied to satisfy different requirements of services.  As the MPLS
   TE LSP is deployed in networks of service providers, several
   challenges has been proposed about esay operation and management.
   This document propose a solution to set up co-routed MPLS TE LSPs on
   demand to faciliate the deployment for services.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the MPLS architecture document
   [RFC3031] and from the RSVP-TE protocol specification [RFC3209] which
   inherits from the RSVP specification [RFC2205].

   The PEs can be generally categorized into two types:

   1.  Active PE: the PE which primarily triggers to set up the LSPs and
   informs the remote PE;

   2.  Passive PE: the PE which secondarily complies with the active
   PE's suggestion.


3.  Problem Statement

3.1.  MPLS TE Configuration

   It is a common deployment scenario to set up MPLS Traffic
   Engineering(TE) LSPs among a set of Label Switch Routers (LSR).  Such
   deployment may require the configuration of a potentially large
   number of TE tunnels.  The operation is not only time consuming but
   also prone to misconfiguration for Service Providers.  Hence, an
   automatic mechanism for setting up MPLS TE tunnels is desirable which
   can simplify the complexity of MPLS TE configuration.

3.2.  Return Path of BFD for LSP

   BFD for LSP ([RFC5884]) is used to detect the possible failure fast
   and the failure detected can trigger traffic switch between the
   primary LSP and the backup LSP.  When BFD for LSP is deployed, the
   return path may take IP path which is different from the forwarding
   path.  The failure that happens in the return path may trigger wrong
   traffic switch.

3.3.  Upgrading of Co-routed Bidirectional LSP

   Co-routed bidirectional LSPs can simplify operation and management
   for Service Providers.  Moreover co-routed bidirectional LSPs require
   less states comparing with two unidirectional MPLS TE LSPs. .But the
   unidirectlional LSP has been deployed widely and it is difficult for
   the service provider to upgrade all possible routers to support co-
   routed bidirectional LSPs.


4.  Framework and Procedures

   The section proposes the solution to trigger setting up MPLS TE LSP
   by services.  The framework an procedures of the solution are
   introduced.  With the solution, MPLS TE LSPs can setup on demand
   which can reduce the statical configuration.  In addition, the
   signalling for the service will advertise the tunnel information
   between the active PE and the passive PE.  The LSP on the passive
   side can setup according to RRO information of the LSP setup from the
   active PE to the passive PE.  Thus the path of the reverse LSP can be
   co-routed with the path of the LSP from the active PE to the passive
   PE.

   The active PE triggers setting up the primary LSP to the passive PE
   and advertises the tunnel information to the passive PE.  According
   to the information advertised the passive PE will set up the return
   MPLS TE LSP which path is co-routed with that of the primary LSP.

   Figure 3 shows the detailed signalling procedures for L2VPN to drive
   setup of co-routed MPLS TE LSPs:

   (1) Active/passive role election through signalling for a pair of PEs
   of a PW (Assume PE1 as active PE and PE2 as passive PE after election
   );

   (2) PE1's PW drives RSVP-TE to create TE LSP(LSP1) while PE2 waits
   for tunnel information advertised by PE1;

              Figure 4: Signalling Tunnel Framework of L3VPN

   Figure 4 shows a framework for co-routed MPLS TE LSPs driven by
   L3VPN.  L3VPN is provisioned on PEs and VPN members are discovered.
   A pair of PEs for L3VPN members will be identified as the active PE
   and the passive PE.  The active PE triggers set up the primary LSP to
   the passive PE and advertises the tunnel information to the passive
   PE.  According to the information advertised the passive PE will set
   up the return MPLS TE LSP which path is co-routed with that of the
   primary LSP.
