1. Introduction

   This document provides additional information on the use of several
   specific event codes related to North American Operator Services and
   Special Information Tones that have been registered in the IANA
   "audio/telephone-event" registry.



2. Discussion

   [RFC4733]defines a mechanism for conveyance of tone signals and other
   telephony events in RTP packets, and establishes an IANA registry as
   well as procedures for registration of "audio/telephone-event" codes.
   Further, [RFC5244] defines and registers additional audio/telephone-
   event codes for channel-oriented telephony signaling.

   In North American PSTN networks, "Special Information Tones" are
   played back towards the caller to convey reasons for call failure,
   such as circuit congestion, etc. These tones are defined in [GR674],
   and audio/telephone-event codes have been registered for these
   signals as well.  These include:

     o North American SIT Segment 1 Low

     o North American SIT Segment 1 High

     o North American SIT Segment 2 Low

Internet-Draft RTP Event Codes for Operator Services and SIT Tones
                            November 2011


     o North American SIT Segment 2 High

     o North American SIT Segment 3



   In North American PSTN networks, there are additional channel-
   oriented telephony signals that are not defined in [RFC5244]. A
   subset of these are defined in [GR506], and audio/telephone-event
   codes have been registered with IANA for these signals. These signals
   include:

     o North American Coin Deposit

     o North American Ringback

     o North American Coin Return

     o North American Coin Collect / Operator Released

     o North American Operator Attached

     o North American Coin Collect

     o North American Operator Released



   These event codes are expected to be used in contexts similar to
   those in which the event codes defined in [RFC5244] would be used,
   i.e., channel associated inband telephony signaling.

   The documents listed as references for these event codes in the IANA
   registry, i.e. [GR506] and [GR674], define the telephony signals in
   terms of frequency components and duration, and in some cases, also
   in terms of a specific number of tone bursts with specific timing
   requirements.

   As with the signals described in [RFC5244], the event codes for these
   signals only represent the frequency component(s) of the signals; the
   duration and timing are not conveyed by the event code. That is,
   there is nothing implicit in these event codes conveying timing
   information about pulse duration, timing, silent interval duration,
   or number of pulses. Pulses must be constructed using these event
   codes the same as would be done with those defined in [RFC5244].

3. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new protocol mechanisms, and
   does not introduce any security concerns.



4. IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any actions of IANA. It provides
   additional information regarding the use of codepoints already
   registered by IANA.
