       Mobility Management Protocols for Cloud-Like Architectures
                   draft-sarikaya-dmm-cloud-mm-00.txt

Abstract

   Telecommunication networks are being virtualized and are moving into
   the cloud networks.  This brings the need to redesign the mobility
   protocols of Mobile and Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This document defines
   mobility management protocols for virtualized networks.  Control and
   data plane separation is achieved by separating Home Agent and Mobile
   Access Gateway functionalities into the control and data planes.

1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 defines client based mobility support to the mobile nodes
   and is defined in [RFC6275].  There are several extensions to Mobile
   IPv6 such as multiple Care-of Address registration for multi-homed
   mobile nodes [RFC5648], flow mobility [RFC6089] and Dual Stack Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC5555].  Mobile IPv6 is based on a centralized mobility
   anchoring architecture at the home agent (HA).

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 defines network based mobility support to the
   mobile nodes and is defined in [RFC5213].  PMIPv6 operation involves
   a a Mobile Access Gateway handling mobility of the mobile node and
   registering the mobile node with the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA)
   which receives and sends MN traffic into the Internet.  LMA operation
   is compatible with the home agent of MIPv6.  IPv4 support for PMIPv6
   is defined in [RFC5844] and flow mobility extensions in
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob].

   Centralized mobility anchoring has several drawbacks such as single
   point of failure, routing in a non optimal route, overloading of the
   centralized data anchor point due to the data traffic increase, low
   scalability of the centralized route and context management
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   Architecture of a cloud network is shown in Figure 1, see also
   [I-D.rekhter-nvo3-vm-mobility-issues].  Top of Rack Switch (ToR) is a
   switch in a cloud network that is connected to the servers.  The
   servers host virtual machines.  A cloud network has one or more Data
   Center Border Routers (BR) or edge routers that connects the cloud
   network to the Internet including other cloud network or storage
   networks.  Storage network is usually part of the same cloud network
   and it is connected to the BR using Fiber Channel (fc) links.

   Control and data plane separation is stated as a requirement for the
   distributed mobility management.  Mobile IPv6 control plane is used
   for registration and handover signaling and for establishing security
   association, e.g.  IPSec SAs.  Data plane is used for data transfer
   from the corresponding nodes (CN) to MN and from MN to CNs.
   Typically control plane traffic is much ligther than the data plane
   traffic and control plane traffic has stronger latency requirements.
   Control plane data plane separation requires signaling between the
   control and data plane functional entities.

          Figure 2: Architecture of MIPv6 Control and Data Planes

   Control and data plane separation can be achieved by dividing HA into
   two functional entities: control plane functional entity and data
   plane functional entity as shown in Figure 2.  These functional
   entities can be hosted on different physical entities.  These two
   entities must share a common database.  The database contains the
   binding cache and the security association information such as IPSec
   keys.

   HA Data Plane function can be implemented as virtual machine (VM) in
   a cloud network.  Binding cache and security associations will be
   stored in the storage center of the cloud entwork that VMs can easily
   access.  HA Control Plane function is geographically more distributed
   than HA data Plane function and is placed closer to the mobile nodes
   in order to meet the latency requirements.

   MN first communicates with the control plane function to establish
   security association.  Address configuration and binding registration
   follows.  Next MN receives/sends data packets using the data plane
   function closest to the link MN is attached.

   When MN moves MN does handover signaling with the control plane
   function which updates the binding cache based on this move.  Control
   plane function informs the new data plane function of this binding
   cache update and then MN starts to receive and send data to the new
   data plane function.  MN MUST keep HA control plane function address
   in cache so that it can conduct handover signaling with it.

Internet-Draft         VMs for Mobility Management          October 2012


   When MN boots, it goes through authentication and security
   association establishment.  Next MN sends a binding update.  MN does
   these steps with HA control plane function.  MN sends Binding Update
   message to HA control plane function and receives a Binding
   Acknowledgement message and in this message MN MUST receive HA data
   plane function address.

   HA data plane function address can be provided by HA control plane
   function to MN in Alternate Home Agent Tunnel Address option defined
   in [I-D.perkins-netext-hatunaddr] of BA message [RFC6275].  MN starts
   tunneling data packets and sends them to Alternate Home Agent Tunnel
   Address.  Also MN receives data packets tunneled from Alternate Home
   Agent Tunnel Address.

   Control and data plane separation does not require protocol
   extensions except the sharing of binding cache and security
   associations database.  How this sharing can be accomplished is left
   out of scope with this specification.


4.  Authentication in Control and Data Plane Separation

   Currently, MN and HA create security associations (SA) based on the
   home address using IKEv2 as the key exchange protocol.  When MN moves
   SAs are reestablished when MN gets a new care-of address.  After SA
   is established, MN and HA use Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
   encapsulation for Binding Updates and Binding Acknowledgements
   [RFC4877].

   IKEv2 enables the use of EAP authentication and provides EAP
   transport between MN as the peer and HA as the authenticator.  EAP
   authentication is done using one of the EAP methods such as EAP-AKA
   [RFC4187].

   MN is authorized as a valid user using EAP authentication.  IKEv2
   public key signature authentication with certificates is used to
   authenticate the home agent and derive keys to be used in exchanging
   BU/BA securely.  MN can use the same identity, e.g.  MN-NAI during
   both EAP and IKEv2 authentication.

   On the other hand MN goes through the access authentication when it
   first connects to the network.  A typical access authentication
   protocol is AKA.  MSK derived from this authentication serves as the
   session key in accessing the air interface.

   There is an overlap between the access and user authentications
   sometimes done using the same protocol, e.g.  AKA.  Full EAP method
   execution may take several round trips, some times five or more round

   trips and slow down the user access to the Internet.  This is
   especially an important consideration in Distributed Mobility
   Management since MN may connect to several home agents instead of
   staying anchored at one home agent.

   In order to reduce the number of round trips EAP authenticaton can be
   combined with reauthentication.  Reauthentication is EAP method
   dependent.  EAP-AKA reauthentication takes only one round trip
   [RFC4187].  MN must go through an EAP-AKA reauthentication before
   when MN was connected to the previous HA.  During reauthentication
   reauthentication ID is generated.  MN MUST use its reauthentication
   ID during IKEv2 EAP authentication with the new home agent.  This
   ensures that EAP-AKA authentication takes only one round trip.  MN
   continues to use its reauthentication ID in subsequent
   reauthentication runs with the same HA.

         Figure 3: Architecture of PMIPv6 Control and Data Planes

   Control and data plane separation can be achieved by dividing MAG
   into two functional entities: MAG control plane functional entity and
   MAG data plane functional entity as shown in Figure 3.  LMA stays the
   same.  LMA can be implemented as virtual machine (VM) in a cloud
   network.  Binding cache and security associations will be stored in
   the storage center of the cloud entwork that VMs can easily access.

   MAG Control Plane function together with MAG Data Plane function is
   geographically distributed and is placed closer to the mobile nodes

Internet-Draft         VMs for Mobility Management          October 2012


   in order to meet the latency requirements.

   MN first communicates with the MAG control plane function to
   establish security association.  Address configuration follows.  Next
   MN receives/sends data packets using the LMA closest to the link MN
   is attached from MAG Data Plane function.

   When MN moves MN does handover signaling with the control plane
   function which MAG control plane function updates the binding cache
   based on this move.  MAG control plane function informs the MAG data
   plane function of this binding cache update and then MN starts to
   receive and send data to the new data plane function.  MN MUST keep
   MAG control plane function address which is the same in the domain
   for all MNs in its cache.

   When MN boots, it goes through authentication and security
   association establishment.  Next MAG control plane function sends a
   proxy binding update to the LMA.  MAG control plane function sends
   Proxy Binding Update message to the LMA and receives a Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement message and in this message MAG control plane
   function MUST receive (possibly new) LMA address.

   LMA address can be provided to MAG control plane function in
   Alternate Home Agent Tunnel Address option defined in
   [I-D.perkins-netext-hatunaddr] of PBA message [RFC5213].  MAG control
   plane function passes the LMA address to MAG data plane function.
   When MAG data plane function receives data packets from MN, it
   encapsulates the packets and sends them to Alternate Home Agent
   Tunnel Address.  Also when packets are received from Alternate Home
   Agent Tunnel Address MAG data plane function decapsulates the packet
   and then send it to the MN.

   Alternate Home Agent Tunnel Address option in Proxy Mobile IPv6 is
   much less useful because MAG data plane function could be
   preconfigured with the LMA address value that happens to be
   topologically closest LMA.
