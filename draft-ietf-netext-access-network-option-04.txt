      Access Network Identifier (ANI) Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6
             draft-ietf-netext-access-network-option-04.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a mechanism and a related mobility option
   for carrying the access network identifier and the access operator
   identification information from the mobile access gateway to the
   local mobility anchor over Proxy Mobile IPv6.  Based on the received
   information, the local mobility anchor is able to provide access
   network and access operator specific handling or policing for the
   mobile node traffic.

Internet-Draft      Access Network Identifier Option        January 2012


1.  Introduction

   In many deployments there is a need for the local mobility anchor to
   provide differentiated services and policing to the mobile nodes
   based on the access network to which they are attached.  Policy
   systems in mobility architectures such as PCC [TS23203] and ANDSF
   [TS23402] in 3GPP system allow configuration of policy rules with
   conditions based on the access network information.  For example, the
   service treatment for the mobile node's traffic may be different when
   they are attached to a access network owned by the home operator than
   when owned by a roaming partner.  The service treatment can also be
   different based on the configured Service Set Identifiers (SSID) in
   case of IEEE 802.11 based access networks.

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213] allows for carrying the
   Access Technology Type (ATT) information from the mobile access
   gateway (MAG) to the local mobility anchor (LMA).  However, the
   Access Technology Type alone is not necessarily sufficient for a
   suitable policy to be applied at the local mobility anchor.
   Therefore, there is a need for an additional access network related
   information to be available at the local mobility anchor.  Learning
   the access network operator identity may not be possible for an local
   mobility anchor without a support of an additional policy framework
   that is able to provide required information out of band to the local
   mobility anchor.  Such a policy framework may not be required for all
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployments and hence an alternative approach for
   carrying such information is required to ensure that additional
   information related to the access network is available.

   This document defines a new mobility option, Access Network
   Identifier (ANI) option and its sub-options for Proxy Mobile IPv6,
   that can be used by mobile access gateway for carrying the access
   network information to the local mobility anchor.  The specific
   details on how the local mobility anchor uses this information are
   out-of-scope for this document.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment where
   the mobile access gateway delivers the information elements related
   to the access network to the local mobility anchor over Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 signaling messages.  In this example, the additional information
   could comprise the used SSID of the used IEEE 802.11 network, the
   geo-location of the mobile node known to the mobile access gateway,
   and the identities of the operators running the IEEE 802.11 access
   network infrastructure.

3.  Access Network Identifier Option

   The Access Network Identifier option is a mobility header option used
   to exchange access network related information between a local
   mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway.  The option can be
   included in both Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) messages, and there can only be a single
   instance of this mobility option in a mobility message.  The Access
   Network Identifier mobility option always contains one or more Access
   Network Identifier Sub-options.  The Access Network Identifier Sub-
   option is described in Section 3.1.

   The alignment requirement for this option is 4n.

      0 -  Reserved.

      1 -  Vendor ID as a four octet Private Enterprise Number [SMI].

      2 -  Realm of the operator.  Realm names are required to be
         unique, and are piggybacked on the administration of the DNS
         namespace.  Realms are encoded using a domain name encoding
         defined in [RFC1035].

   Operator Identifier:  Up to 253 octets of the operator identifier.
      The encoding of the identifier depends on the used Operator-ID
      Type.  Numeric values are encoded in network byte order and
      strings have no terminating '\0' mark.


4.  Protocol Considerations

   The following considerations apply to the local mobility anchor and
   the mobile access gateway.

4.1.  Mobile Access Gateway Considerations

   o  The conceptual Binding Update List entry data structure maintained
      by the mobile access gateway, described in Section 6.1 of
      [RFC5213], MUST be extended to store the access network related
      information elements associated with the current session.
      Specifically, the following parameters must be defined.

      Network-Identifier

      Operator-Identifier

      Geo-Location

   o  If the mobile access gateway is configured to support Access
      Network Information option, it SHOULD include this option with the
      specific sub-options in all Proxy Binding Update messages
      (including in Proxy Binding Updates for lifetime extension and for
      deregistration) that it sends to the local mobility anchor.  The
      Access Network Information option SHOULD be constructed as
      specified in Section 3.  It should include the relevant ANI sub-
      options that the mobile access gateway is configured to carry them
      in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 messages.

   o  The access network information elements, such as Access Network
      Name, Geo-location and the Operator Identifier, typically are
      statically configured on the mobile access gateway on a per-
      interface basis (Example: Access Point (AP-1) is attached through



Gundavelli, et al.        Expires July 10, 2012                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Access Network Identifier Option        January 2012


      interface-1, and the SSID is X, Geo-Location is Y).  In some
      deployments, this information can also be dynamically obtained,
      such as through DHCP Option (82), which is the DHCP Relay Agent
      Information option [RFC3046].  When the mobile node sends a DHCP
      Request, the Access Points typically add the SSID information to
      the Option 82 of the DHCP request and when the mobile access
      gateway receives this request, it can parse the Option 82 of the
      DHCP request and obtain the SSID name.  The specific details on
      how the mobile access gateway obtains these information elements
      are access technology and deployment specific, and is out-side the
      scope of this document.

   o  If the protocol configuration variable,
      EnableANISubOptNetworkIdentifier, is set to a value of (1), the
      mobile access gateway SHOULD include the Network-Identifier sub-
      option in the Access Network Identifier option carried in the
      Proxy Binding Update.  For including the Network-Identifier sub-
      option, the mobile access gateway needs to be aware of the network
      name of the access network (Ex: SSID in case WLAN Access Network)
      to which the mobile node is attached.  This sub-option MUST be
      constructed as described in Section 3.1.1

   o  If the protocol configuration variable,
      EnableANISubOptGeoLocation, is set to a value of (1), the mobile
      access gateway SHOULD include the Geo-Location sub-option in the
      Access Network Identifier option carried in the Proxy Binding
      Update.  For including the Geo-Location sub-option, the mobile
      access gateway needs to be aware of the GPS coordinates of the
      network to which the mobile node is attached.  This sub-option
      MUST be constructed as described in Section 3.1.2.

   o  If the protocol configuration variable,
      EnableANISubOptOperatorIdentifier, is set to a value of (1), the
      mobile access gateway SHOULD include the Operator-Identifier sub-
      option in the Access Network Identifier option carried in the
      Proxy Binding Update.  For including the Operator-Identifier sub-
      option, the mobile access gateway needs to be aware of the
      operator identity of that access network.  This sub-option MUST be
      constructed as described in Section 3.1.3.

   If the mobile access gateway had any of the Access Network
   Information mobility option included the Proxy Binding Update sent to
   a local mobility anchor, then the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   received from the local mobility anchor is also expected to contain
   the Access Network Information mobility option with the specific sub-
   options.  If the mobile access gateway receives a Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement with a successful Status Value but without an Access
   Network Information mobility option, then the mobile access gateway

   SHOULD log the event and based on its local policy MAY proceed to
   terminate the mobility session.  In this case the mobile access
   gateway knows the local mobility anchor does not understand the
   Access Network Information mobility option and therefore MAY consider
   it as a misconfiguration of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

4.2.  Local Mobility Anchor Considerations

   o  The conceptual Binding Cache entry data structure maintained by
      the local mobility anchor, described in Section 5.1 of [RFC5213],
      MUST be extended to store the access network related information
      elements associated with the current session.  Specifically, the
      following parameters must be defined.

      Network-Identifier

      Operator-Identifier

      Geo-Location

   o  On receiving a Proxy Binding Update message [RFC5213] from a
      mobile access gateway with the Access Network Information option,
      the local mobility anchor must process the option and update the
      corresponding fields in the Binding Cache entry.

   o  If the local mobility anchor understands the Access Network
      Identifier mobility option received in a Proxy Binding Update and
      also agrees with the sub-option(s) content defined in this
      specification, then the local mobility anchor MUST echo the Access
      Network Identifier mobility option back to a mobile access gateway
      in a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement.  The Access Network Identifier
      sub-options defined in this specification MUST NOT be altered by
      the local mobility anchor.  Future specification utilizing Access
      Network Identifier mobility option MAY define use cases and new
      sub-options that can purposely be altered by a local mobility
      anchor.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update message does not include the
      Access Network Information option, but the mobility session
      associated to that request has the previously notified access
      network specific information elements, the same MUST be updated
      and those information elements previously received MUST be
      removed.

   o  The local mobility anchor MAY choose to use the access network
      information options for applying any access operator specific
      handling or policing of the mobile node traffic.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA actions.

      Action-1: This specification defines a new Mobility Header option,
      the Access Network Identifier.  This mobility option is described
      in Section 3.  The Type value for this option needs to be assigned
      from the same numbering space as allocated for the other mobility
      options, as defined in [RFC6275].

      Action-2: This specification defines a new mobility sub-option
      format, Access Network Information (ANI) sub-option.  The format
      of this mobility sub-option is described in Section 3.1.  This
      sub-option can be carried in Access Network Information option.
      The type value for this sub-option needs to be managed by IANA,
      under the Registry, Access Network Information sub-option.  This
      specification reserves the following type values.  Approval of new
      Access Network Information (ANI) sub-option type values are to be
      made through IANA Expert Review.

         0 - Reserved

         1 - Network-Identifier Sub-option

         2 - Geo-Location Sub-option

         3 - Operator-Identifier Sub-option

      Action-3: This specification defines a new mobility sub-option,
      Operator-Identifier sub-option.  The format of this mobility sub-
      option is described in Section 3.1.3.  The Operator Identifier
      (Op-Id) Type field of this sub-option introduces a new number
      space.  This number space needs to be managed by IANA, under the
      Registry, Operator Identifier Type Registry.  This specification
      reserves the following type values.  Approval of new Operator
      Identifier Type values are to be made through IANA Expert Review.

         0 - Reserved

         1 - Vendor ID as a four octet Private Enterprise Number

         2 - Realm of the operator


6.  Protocol Configuration Variables

   This specification defines the following configuration variables that
   control the use of Access Network Information related sub-options in



Gundavelli, et al.        Expires July 10, 2012                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      Access Network Identifier Option        January 2012


   Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.  The mobility entities, local
   mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway MUST allow these
   variables to be configured by the system management.  The configured
   values for these protocol variables MUST survive server reboots and
   service restarts.

   EnableANISubOptNetworkIdentifier

         This flag indicates whether or not support for Network-
         Identifier sub-option should be enabled.  This configuration
         variable is available at both in the mobile access gateway and
         at the local mobility anchor.  The default value for this flag
         is set to (0), indicating that the support for Network-
         Identifier sub-option is disabled.

         When this flag on the mobile access gateway is set to a value
         of (1), the mobile access gateway SHOULD include this sub-
         option in the Proxy Binding Update messages that it sends to
         the local mobility anchor, otherwise it SHOULD NOT include the
         sub-option.

         Similarly, when this flag on the local mobility anchor is set
         to a value of (1), the local mobility anchor SHOULD enable
         support for this sub-option, otherwise it SHOULD ignore this
         sub-option.

   EnableANISubOptGeoLocation

         This flag indicates whether or not support for Geo-Location
         sub-option should be enabled.  This configuration variable is
         available at both in the mobile access gateway and at the local
         mobility anchor.  The default value for this flag is set to
         (0), indicating that the support for Geo-Location sub-option is
         disabled.

         When this flag on the mobile access gateway is set to a value
         of (1), the mobile access gateway SHOULD include this sub-
         option in the Proxy Binding Update messages that it sends to
         the local mobility anchor, otherwise it SHOULD NOT include the
         sub-option.

         Similarly, when this flag on the local mobility anchor is set
         to a value of (1), the local mobility anchor SHOULD enable
         support for this sub-option, otherwise it SHOULD ignore this
         sub-option.

   EnableANISubOptOperatorIdentifier

         This flag indicates whether or not support for Operator-
         Identifier sub-option should be enabled.  This configuration
         variable is available at both in the mobile access gateway and
         at the local mobility anchor.  The default value for this flag
         is set to (0), indicating that the support for Operator-
         Identifier sub-option is disabled.

         When this flag on the mobile access gateway is set to a value
         of (1), the mobile access gateway SHOULD include this sub-
         option in the Proxy Binding Update messages that it sends to
         the local mobility anchor, otherwise it SHOULD NOT include the
         sub-option.

         Similarly, when this flag on the local mobility anchor is set
         to a value of (1), the local mobility anchor SHOULD enable
         support for this sub-option, otherwise it SHOULD ignore this
         sub-option.


7.  Security Considerations

   The Access Network Information option defined in this specification
   is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages.  This option is carried like any other mobility header
   option as specified in [RFC6275] and does not require any special
   security considerations.

   The Geo-location sub-option carried in the Access Network Information
   option exposes the geo-location of the mobile node as presented by
   the mobile access gateway and this information should be considered
   as very sensitive.  Care must be taken to secure the Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 signaling messages when carrying this sub-option.  The base
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC6275] specifies the use of IPsec
   for securing the signaling messages and those mechanisms can be
   enabled for protecting this information.
