INTERNET-DRAFT                                     Nick/Label Properties


1. Introduction

   There are a number of current and prospective requirements to
   indicate properties of Nicknames, data Labels, and blocks thereof,
   for use with the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links
   [RFC6325]) protocol. To meet that need, this document specifies two
   IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System [ISO-10589]
   [RFC1195]) sub-TLVs and some of their uses.

   These sub-TLVs are used to flag properties of Nicknames and data
   Labels. Provision is made for flags associated with

      o  individual Nicknames,
      o  blocks of Nicknames,
      o  individual Labels, and
      o  blocks of Labels.

   In addition, different sizes of Nicknames and data Labels can be
   accommodated.

   The sub-TLVs specified in this document are used as follows:

   o  They appear only in the IS-IS Router Capability and MT-Capability
      TLVs, which are TLVs number 242 and 144 and are specified in
      [RFC4971] and [RFC6329] respectively.

   o  They can appear multiple times in the same or different Capability
      or MT-Capability TLVs.



1.1 Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. The Nickname Properties Sub-TLV

   The structure of the Nickname properties (NICK-PROP) sub-TLV is as
   shown below.

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         | Type = TBD    |                (1 byte)
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         | Length        |                (1 byte)

         | NICK-PROP RECORD K
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...

                  Figure 1. The Nickname Properties Sub-TLV


   o  Type: NICK-PROP Sub-TLV type, set to TBD.

   o  Length: Variable.

   o  NICK-PROP RECORD: Variable length record as described below.

   Each NICK-PROP RECORD is structured as follows.

         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |NB|  NKSZ  |IN|OK|     RESV                    |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       | Nickname Information          (variable)
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...

   NB: If the NB (Nickname Block) flag is zero, the Nickname Information
       is a single Nickname. If the NB flag is one, the Nickname
       Information consists of an initial and final Nickname that are
       treated as unsigned integers and specify a block of Nicknames
       inclusively.

   NKSZ: The NKSZ field specifies the size of each of the one or two
       Nickname values (see NB bit) that occur in the Nickname
       Information

       The assigned value of NKSZ is as follows:

INTERNET-DRAFT                                     Nick/Label Properties


           NKSZ
           ----
              0    16-bit Nicknames
            1-7    Available for assignment

   IN: The IN flag is ignored unless the NB flag is zero and the
       Nickname Information is a Nickname owned by the RBridge
       advertising the enclosing NICK-PROP sub-TLV. When effective and
       equal to one, the IN flag indicates that the Nickname may be used
       by the advertising RBridge as the ingress Nickname for TRILL Data
       frames it creates.

       TRILL switches may have multiple Nicknames [RFC6325] but there is
       no reason within the TRILL protocol for a TRILL switch to use
       more than one Nickname as the ingress Nickname for TRILL Data
       frames it creates. If a TRILL switch is not using all the
       Nicknames it holds as ingress Nicknames, it SHOULD use the NICK-
       PROP sub-TLV to indicate the Nickname (or Nicknames) it is using
       as ingress. This reduces the amount of Reverse Path Forwarding
       Check (RPFC) state in the campus.  The amount of such state at
       each TRILL switch port is roughly proportional to the product the
       number of ingress Nicknames in use and the number of multi-
       destination distribution trees in use. If a TRILL switch does not
       avertise any ingress Nickname or Nicknames using the IN flag, it
       may use any Nickname it hold as an ingress Nickname.

   OK: The OK flag is only effective if the NB flag is one and the NICK-
       PROP sub-TLV is advertised by the TRILL switch that is highest
       priority to be a tree root. TRILL switches that understand the OK
       flag and see one or more effective OK flags set to one
       dynamically select their Nickname as specified in [RFC6325] and
       [clearcorrect] except that they do so only from the block or
       blocks of nicknames advertised by NICK-PROP sub-TLV NICK-PROP
       RECORDS with an effective OK flag set to one. Such blocks are
       called the OK Nicknames blocks and a Nickname that is included in
       them is called an OK Nickname. If any Nickname value in the range
       from 0xFFC0 through 0xFFFF or equal to 0x0000 is advertised as
       part of an OK Nickname block they are ignored. For example, if
       0xE000 through 0xFFFF was advertised as an OK Nickname block, it
       would be treated as if 0xE000 through 0xFFBF was advertised.

       If the OK Nickname blocks change such that any TRILL switch is
       holding a Nickname that is no longer OK, that TRILL switch MUST
       allocate a new OK Nickname. To avoid network instability, all
       TRILL switches that might become highest priority tree root
       SHOULD advertise the same OK Nickname blocks.

       Intended uses of this flag are to restrict Nicknames within part
       of a network so as to support some methods to implement
       [multilevel] or [multidatacenter] TRILL.

   RESV: The remaining 10 bits are reserved and MUST be set to zero and
       ignored on receipt.

       Nickname Information: If NB is zero, this information consists of
       a single Nickname. If NB is one, this information consists of an
       initial and final Nickname and represents a block of Nicknames.
       The Nicknames are treated as unsigned integers in network byte
       order. If the final Nickname is less than the initial Nickname,
       the NICK-PROP RECORD is ignored. If the initial and final
       Nicknames are equal, then a block of size one is indicated.
       Otherwise a block of Nickname values with a size greater than one
       is indicated, starting with initial Nickname through and
       including the final Nickname. If the size of each Nickname value
       is not a multiple of 8 bits, the Nickname values are padded with
       initial reserved bits up to the next multiple of 8. These
       reserved bits MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   Each NICK-PROP RECORD must fit within the Length of the NICK-PROP
   sub-TLV. If there is a truncated NICK-PROP RECORD at the end of hte
   sub-TLV, that RECORD is ignored.

   For IANA Considerations in assigning values of NKSZ and bits in the
   RESV field, see Section 4.

3. The Label Properties Sub-TLV

   The structure of the Label properties (LABEL-PROP) sub-TLV is as
   shown below.

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         | Type = TBD    |                (1 byte)

         | LABEL-PROP RECORD 1            (variable)
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...
         | LABEL-PROP RECORD 2            (variable)

                    Figure 2. The Label Properties Sub-TLV

   o  Type: LABEL-PROP Sub-TLV type, set to TBD.

   o  Length: Variable.

   o  LABEL-PROP RECORD: Variable length record as described below.

   Each LABEL-PROP RECORD is structured as follows.

         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       | Label Information             (variable)
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...

   LB: If the LB (Label Block) flag is zero, the Label Information is a
       single Label. If the LB flag is one, the Label Information
       consists of an initial and final Label that are treated as
       unsigned integers and specify a block of Labels inclusively.

   LBSZ: The LBSZ field specifies the size and type of each of the one
       or two Label values (see LB bit) that occur in the Nickname
       Information

       The assigned values of LBSZ are as follows:

INTERNET-DRAFT                                     Nick/Label Properties


           LBSZ
           ----
              0    12-bit VLAN ID
              1    24-bit FGL Label [FGL]
            2-7

   SCP: The SCP or Scope field only has an effect if it is non-zero and
       the LABEL-PROP sub-TLV is advertised by the TRILL switch that is
       highest priority to be a tree root. If indicates the scope of
       propagation of TRILL Data frames having the data label or any of
       the data labels in the block indicated by the PROPERTY RECORD.
       The following values for SCP are currently specified:

          SCP   Meaning
          ---   -------
            0   No scope specified
            1   Available for assignment
            2   Throughout a campus
            3   Local, within part of a campus [TreeDistr]

   MG: The MG bit is used to indicate the management Label. It is only
       effective if the LB flag is zero and the LABEL-PROP sub-TLV is
       advertised by the TRILL switch that is highest priority to be a
       tree root. All TRILL switches that understand this bit MUST
       indicate interest in the listed Label unless this bit is set for
       more than one Label, in which case only the lowest valued such
       Label will be considered the management Label. The failure of a
       TRILL switch to indicate interest in this label will be ignored
       and tree distribution of TRILL data frames with this label will
       not be pruned.

   RESV: The remaining 9 bits are reserved. See Section 4 for IANA
       Considerations.

   Label Information: If LB is zero, this information consists of a
       single Label. If LB is one, this information consists of an
       initial and final Label and represents a block of Labels. The
       Labels are treated as unsigned integers in network byte order. If
       the final Label is less than the initial Label, the LABEL-PROP
       RECORD is ignored. If the initial and final Labels are equal,
       then a block of size one is indicated.  Otherwise a block of
       Label values with a size greater than one is indicated, starting
       with initial Label through and including the final Label. If the
       size of each Label value is not a multiple of 8 bits, each Label
       value is padded with initial reserved bits up to the next
       multiple of 8. These reserved bits MUST be sent as zero and
       ignored on receipt. For example, 12-bit Labels are padded with
       four initial zeros.
