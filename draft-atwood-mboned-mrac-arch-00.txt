1.  Introduction

   Group communication at the application level usually implies IP
   multicast at the network level.  The use of IP multicast can only be
   justified in certain environments if it is possible to authenticate
   the receiving users, and verify their authorization to receive the
   multicast data stream.  However, the design of IP multicast [RFC1112]
   ensures that there can be no relationship between the sender and the
   receiving users, i.e., the sender is not aware of the identity of the
   receivers (or even if there are any receivers at all).  This can make
   it very difficult for the sender to generate any revenue from the
   receivers of IP multicast services.

   An alternative to access control by the sender is access control by
   the Network Service Provider, based on policies provided (directly or
   indirectly) by the sender.  [I-D.atwood-mboned-mrac-req] lists the
   requirements on a set of mechanisms that allow a Network Service
   Provider to act on behalf of a sender (since the Network Service
   Provider has access to information from the receiving user that the
   sender does not have access to) to meet the access control and

   revenue generation goals, while remaining as independent as possible
   from the specific business model in use.

   This document assumes that the various business models could be
   simplified into two assumptions as follows:

      The receiving user that receives the multicast data possesses a
      "ticket", which contains a description of the multicast group to
      be joined and whose validity can be demonstrated.

      The Network Service Provider that delivers the multicast data
      possesses the "policies" that contain a description of how to
      validate the "ticket" of a receiving user.

   [I-D.atwood-mboned-mrac-req] has presented how to fulfill the two
   assumptions in our business models.

   This document proposes a Multicast Receiver Access Control (MRAC)
   architecture that satisfies all the requirements in
   [I-D.atwood-mboned-mrac-req].  In this draft, the above two
   assumptions are used so that the business model in use does not have
   to be considered.

2.  MRAC Architecture Overview

   The MRAC system has the interacting components as shown in Figure 1.
   A brief description of the components is as follows:

                        Figure 1: MRAC Architecture

   End User (EU):

     A subscriber who wishes to receive multicast data delivered in a
     multicast group.  The EU possesses a "ticket" to verify his/her
     subscription for a specific group.  However, the way how to
     distribute the ticket to the EU is dependent on the business model
     so that it is out of scope for this draft.

   End User Device (EUD):

     A device, connected to the Network Service Provider via one or more
     technologies, operated by an End User.

   Network Service Provider (NSP):

     An organization that delivers the multicast content to the End User
     Device and implements the access control of the receiving End Users
     for multicast groups.  The NSP employs various devices to fulfill
     its services.

   AAA Server (AAAS):

     A device that manages authentication, authorization and accounting
     services for multicast groups in NSP.  The AAAS possesses policies
     to validate the EU's tickets.  However, the way how to distribute
     the policies to the AAAS is dependent on the business model so that
     it is out of scope for this draft.

   Access Router (AR):

     A router, close to the EU, which is responsible for adjudicating
     the access rights to the network and the multicast groups in the
     NSP.

   Network Access Server (NAS):

     The enforcement point for managing authentication, authorization
     and accounting services for multicast groups in the NSP.  Normally
     the NAS is co-located with the Access Router.

   The operations among the interacting components are generalized into
   two levels as follows:

   Application-level operations:

     The EU interacts with the NAS to request joining the group to which
     he/she has subscribed.  The EU's ticket is carried in the request.
     The NAS consults the AAAS for the EU's request.  The AAAS uses the
     policies to validate the ticket so as to authenticate the EU for
     the network and to authorize the EU for the multicast group.  Then
     the AAAS returns the authentication and authorization result to the
     NAS.  If the EU is authorized, some cryptographic materials derived
     from the ticket are also provided to the NAS by the AAAS.
     Moreover, the accounting information for the authorized EU is also
     exchanged between the NAS and the AAAS.

   Network-level operations:

     the EU interacts with the AR to join the data distribution tree
     that is delivering his/her subscription content.  The exchanges
     between the EU and the AR at the network level are secured by the
     cryptographic materials derived from those used at the application
     level, to couple the access control for the two levels.

3.  Multicast Architecture

3.1.  IGMP/MLD

   Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener
   Discovery (MLD) have been standardized by the IETF for IPv4 and IPv6
   systems (host or router) to inform the neighbouring multicast
   router(s) about the multicast group memberships of these systems.

   In IGMP, an IPv4 system sends a join or leave message (through
   Membership Report) when it wants to join or leave a multicast group
   (or some specific sources of a group).  All multicast routers that
   are directly connected to the IPv4 system receive the Membership
   Report to learn which multicast groups are of interest to the IPv4
   systems.  Among these multicast routers, only one will be elected as
   "Querier".  Its role is to query IPv4 systems about their interest in
   multicast groups by sending Membership Query.  The other multicast
   routers are called Non-Queriers; they just receive the Membership
   Report messages from the IPv4 system and the Membership Query message
   from the Querier.

   MLD is a similar protocol but it is used by IPv6 systems.

Internet-Draft              MRAC Architecture               October 2013


   The details of the IGMP/MLD architecture and operation are specified
   in [RFC3376] and [RFC3810].

3.2.  Multicast Routing Protocol (MRP)

   The multicast routing protocol (typically PIM-SM) builds a multicast
   tree among routers to distribute multicast data to receivers.

   One of the receiver's neighbouring routers is elected as the
   designated router (DR) or group designated router (GDR).  On
   receiving the IGMP/MLD join message, DR/GDR will be grafted to the
   multicast data distribution tree on behalf of the neighbouring
   receiver.  On receiving an IGMP leave Message, DR/GDR will be pruned
   from the data distribution tree if no other neighbouring receivers
   are interested in the group.

   The details of PIM-SM architecture and operation are specified in
   [RFC4601].

4.  AAA Architecture

4.1.  Diameter / RADIUS

   AAA protocols are used to support AAA communication between a AAA
   client and AAA server(s).  RADIUS and Diameter are the two AAA
   protocols that the IETF has standardized.

   Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) is a protocol for
   carrying information related to authentication, authorization, and
   accounting between a RADIUS Client and RADIUS Server.  A RADIUS
   Client is responsible for passing user information to designated
   RADIUS Servers, and then acting on the response that is returned.
   RADIUS Servers are responsible for receiving user connection
   requests, authenticating the user, and then returning all
   configuration information necessary for the client to deliver service
   to the user.

   Diameter is the successor of RADIUS.  The Diameter base protocol
   provides a AAA framework.  The Diameter applications, such as NASREQ
   and Mobile IPv4, specify how to use the base protocol within the
   context of their applications.

   The details of Diameter / RADIUS architecture and operation are
   specified in [RFC6733] and [RFC2865]

4.2.  EAP

Internet-Draft              MRAC Architecture               October 2013


   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides an authentication
   framework for support of multiple authentication methods.

   An EAP exchange runs between an authenticator and a peer.  The
   authenticator as an initiator uses one or more EAP methods in
   sequence to authenticate the peer.

   Rather than requiring the authenticator to support authentication
   methods, EAP permits the use of a backend authentication server,
   which implements EAP methods, with the authenticator acting as a
   pass-through.  In this case, a backend authentication server is
   connected with the authenticator.  The actual authentication will be
   performed by the backend authentication server.  The authenticator
   forwards EAP packets received from the peer to the backend
   authentication server; packets received from the backend
   authentication server are forwarded to the peer.

   EAP does not run directly over the IP layer.  The PANA protocol
   (Section 4.3) and the AAA protocol (Section 4.1) will be used to
   carry the EAP packets.

   The details of the EAP architecture and operation are specified in
   [RFC3748].

4.3.  PANA

   Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) is a
   network access authentication protocol that works as an EAP lower
   layer for transmitting EAP packets.  PANA carries EAP authentication
   methods (encapsulated inside EAP packets) between a PANA Client (PaC)
   and a PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) in the access network.

   The PaC, as the client implement of PANA, interacts with the PAA, as
   the server implement of PANA, in the authentication process using the
   PANA protocol.  PAA consults an Authentication Server (AS) for
   authentication and authorization of a PaC.  If the AS resides on the
   same node as the PAA, an API is sufficient for this interaction.
   When the PAA is separated from the AS, a AAA protocol (e.g.,
   Diameter) will be used for their communication.  The AS is a
   conventional backend AAAS that terminates the EAP and the EAP
   methods.

   A PANA Enforcement Point (EP) allows (blocks) data traffic of an
   authorized (unauthorized) PaC.  When the PAA and EP reside on the
   same node, they use an API for communication; otherwise, a protocol
   (e.g., SNMP) is required.

Internet-Draft              MRAC Architecture               October 2013


   The details of the PANA architecture and operation are specified in
   [RFC5191] and [RFC5193].

5.  IP Security (IPsec) Architecture

   The IP security (IPsec) architecture is designed to provide security
   services for traffic at the IP layer.  Most of the security services
   are provided through use of two traffic security protocols, the
   Authentication Header (AH)[RFC4302] and the Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP)[RFC4303], and through the use of cryptographic key
   management procedures and protocols.

   A security association (SA) is created in both sender and receiver.
   It is a simplex "connection" that affords security services to the
   traffic carried by it.  The sender and receiver maintain their local
   Security Association Database (SAD) to record their SAs.

   In the unicast case, the SAs could be dynamically negotiated between
   the sender and the receiver using IKEv2 [RFC5996].  In contrast, in
   the multicast case, a Group Controller / Key Server (GCKS) is
   responsible for distribution of the group SAs (GSA) to all the group
   members (GM) in the same group.

   The details of the IPsec architecture and its extension for multicast
   are specified in [RFC4301] and [RFC5374].

6.  MRAC System Operation

   The MRAC architecture is composed from individual elements drawn from
   the pieces outlined in Sections 3, 4, and 5.  In this way, it is
   possible to meet the requirments as listed in
   [I-D.atwood-mboned-mrac-req].

6.1.  Mapping the Multicast and AAA Architectures to the Network Boxes

   In order to meet the requirements in [I-D.atwood-mboned-mrac-req],
   all the functional entities that are applied in the multicast
   routing, AAA and IPsec architectures are mapped into the participants
   in our MRAC architecture as shown in Table 1.

   The EU in MRAC system maps the IPv4/IPv6 system in IGMP/MLD, the
   receiver in multicast routing protocol, PaC in PANA and EAP peer in
   EAP.

   The NAS in MRAC system maps the Diameter/RADIUS Client in Diameter/
   RADIUS, PAA in PANA and EAP Authenticator in EAP.

   The AAAS in MRAC system maps the Diameter/RADIUS Server in Diameter/
   RADIUS, EAP backend authenticator server in EAP.

   The AR in MRAC system maps the multicast router in IGMP/MLD including
   Querier and Non-Querier, the EP in PANA.  Moreover, the AR who wins
   in DR/GDR election maps the DR/GDR in multicast routing protocol.

   The EU and AR also map the GMs in IPsec.  It depends on the specific
   packet whether the sender is EU or AR.  A special AR, called Querier,
   may map the GCKS in IPsec.

6.2.  EAP Exchanges

   The EAP runs between an EU and an NAS, where the NAS can act as a
   pass-through, and an AAAS is connected with the NAS.  The policy is
   used to determine whether actual authentication is performed by the
   AAAS or the NAS.

   In MRAC, it is recommended that the NAS use EAP-FAST as the EAP
   authentication method to authenticate the EU.  The EU carries a token
   of his/her ticket in EAP-FAST method.  The token includes the user
   information and group information to make the NAS or AAAS to do the
   authentication and authorization decision for the EU.

Internet-Draft              MRAC Architecture               October 2013


6.3.  PANA Exchanges

   PANA carries the EAP-FAST method (encapsulated inside EAP packets)
   between an EU and an NAS in the access network.  An EU may be
   configured with an IP address of the NAS as its PAA or dynamically
   discover it using the default method of DHCP.

   An EU, on receiving a request to join a multicast group while no GSAs
   have been established for the group, initiates a PANA exchange with
   an NAS as its PAA.  During the PANA session, the NAS authenticates
   and authorizes the EU.  In addition, the re-authentication and re-
   authorization may be required if necessary.  The NAS would consult
   the AAAS to perform the actual authentication if it is a pass-through
   in the EAP exchange.  The communication between NAS and AAAS is
   implemented by Diameter/RADIUS exchanges explained in the next
   subsection.  Moreover, the NAS updates the filter state of the EU
   according to the authorization result and provides the authorization
   result and authorization attributes (mainly referring to a key
   derived from the EAP-FAST method) to the AR(s) connected directly to
   the EU.

6.4.  Diameter/RADIUS Exchanges

   When the NAS is a pass-through, the Diameter / RADIUS exchanges are
   used between NAS and AAAS to carry information related to
   authentication, authorization, and accounting.

   In the Diameter / RADIUS exchanges, the NAS is responsible for
   passing the EAP-FAST method (carrying the token of the EU's ticket)
   to the AAAS, and then acting on the response that is returned.  The
   AAAS is responsible for authenticating and authorizing the EU, and
   then returning the result and attributes (mainly including a key
   derived from the EAP-FAST method) for the EU to the NAS.

6.5.  IPsec Exchanges

   IPsec is used to enforce the receiver access control at the network
   level.  A protocol is needed to create IPsec GSAs and then distribute
   them to authorized EUs and their ARs dynamically.  The protocol may
   be very similar to the two existing IETF protocols, GDOI and G-IKEv2.
   In MRAC, the Querier will become the GCKS in the network segment.
   The authorized EUs and the other ARs interact with their Querier.
   The Querier is responsible for checking the authorized attributes of
   the EUs.  Then the Querier creates and distributes IPsec GSAs to the
   EUs and their ARs in the same network segment.

   However, the two existing IETF protocols (GDOI and G-IKEv2) do not
   satisfy all the requirements for IPsec GSA creation and distribution
   in MRAC.  A new protocol has been drafted for use by MRAC.

6.6.  IGMP/MLD Exchanges

   IGMP/MLD is running among the EUs and their ARs.  According to
   [RFC3376] and [RFC3810], the EU uses the message of Membership Report
   to report the current multicast reception status to its ARs.  The
   specific AR, called Querier, uses the message of Membership Query to
   query the multicast reception status of its EUs.

   However, in order to enforce the receiver access control at the
   network level, the ARs and the EUs would filter out the received
   Membership Report and Membership Query messages using their local
   IPsec systems.  The message of Membership Report that reports the
   reception status of the subscribed group would be protected by IPsec
   GSAs whose source address is the EU's address and whose destination
   address is the address of the reported subscribed group.  Also, the
   Membership Query message that queries the reception status of the
   subscribed group would be protected by IPsec GSAs whose source
   address is the Querier's address and whose destination address is the
   address of the queried subscribed group.

   In order to utilize the IPsec system, IGMP and MLD must be extended.
   However, the extension will be very small.
