1. Introduction 

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6 [RFC3315]) 
   enables DHCPv6 servers to pass configuration parameters. It offers 
   configuration flexibility. If not secured, DHCPv6 is vulnerable to 
   various attacks, particularly spoofing attack. 

   This document analyzes the security issues of DHCPv6 in details. This 
   document is aiming to provide mechanisms for improving the security 
   of DHCPv6, thus the address of a DHCPv6 message sender, which can be 
   a DHCPv6 server, a relay agent or a client, is able to be verified by 
   a receiver. It improves communication security of DHCPv6 interaction. 
   The security mechanisms specified in this document is mainly based on 
   the Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA [RFC3972]). 

   Secure DHCPv6 is applicable in environments where physical security 
   on the link is not assured (such as over wireless) and attacks on 
   DHCPv6 are a concern. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Security Overview of DHCPv6 

   DHCPv6 is a client/server protocol that provides managed 
   configuration of devices. It enables DHCPv6 server to auto-configure 
   relevant network parameters on clients through the DHCPv6 message 
   exchanging mechanisms. In the basic DHCPv6 specifications [RFC3315], 
   security of DHCPv6 message can be improved in a few aspects. 

   a)   In the basic DHCPv6 specifications, the DHCPv6 server uses a 
      "regular" IPv6 address for itself. It is possible for a malicious 
      attacker to use a fake address to spoof or launch an attack. See 
      Section 23, "Security Considerations" of [RFC3315] for more 
      details. 

      Furthermore, if DHCPv6 servers play the role of updating DNS and 
      other directory services, attackers may spoof DHCPv6 servers to 
      register incorrect information in those services. 

      CGA-based security mechanism can provide source address ownership 
      proofing, which prevents such attacks. 

   b)   The basic DHCPv6 specifications achieve message origin 
      authentication and message integrity via an authentication option

      with a symmetric key pair. For the key of the hash function, there 
      are two key management mechanisms. Firstly, the key management is 
      out of band, usually manual, i.e. operators set up key database 
      for both server and client before running DHCPv6. Usually multiple 
      keys are deployed once a time and key id is used to specify which 
      key is used. Manual key distribution runs counter to the goal of 
      minimizing the configuration data needed at each host. Secondly, a 
      DHCPv6 server sends a reconfigure key to the client in the initial 
      exchange of DHCPv6 messages for future use, in this case security 
      is not guaranteed because this key is transmitted in plaintext. 

      Comparing to this, CGA-based security mechanism does not request 
      any key management mechanisms. 

   c)   Communication between a server and a relay agent, and 
      communication between relay agents, can be secured through the use 
      of IPsec, as described in section 21.1 in [RFC3315]. However, 
      IPsec is quite complicated. A simpler security mechanism may have 
      better deploy ability. 

4. Secure DHCPv6 Overview 

   To solve the abovementioned security issues, we introduce CGAs into 
   DHCPv6. CGAs are introduced in [RFC3972]. "CGAs are IPv6 addresses 
   for which the interface identifier is generated by computing a 
   cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and auxiliary 
   parameters. The binding between the public key and the address can be 
   verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash 
   with the interface identifier. Messages sent from an IPv6 address can 
   be protected by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and 
   by signing the message with the corresponding private key. The 
   protection works without a certification authority or any security 
   infrastructure." 

   This documentation introduces a Secure DHCPv6 mechanism that uses 
   CGAs to secure the DHCPv6 protocol. It assumes the secured DHCPv6 
   message sender has already haven CGAs and their correspondent CGA 
   parameters; and the receiver has already been given the CGAs of the 
   sender. 

   In this document, a CGA option with an address ownership proof 
   mechanism and a signature option with a corresponding verification 
   mechanism are introduced. A DHCPv6 message (from either a server, a 
   relay agent or a client) with a CGA as source address, can carry the 
   CGA Parameters data structure and a digital signature. The receiver 
   of this DHCPv6 message, who has already known the CGA of the sender, 
   can verify both the CGA and signature, then process the payload of 
   the DHCPv6 message only if the validation is successful.

   can verify both the CGA and signature, then process the payload of 
   the DHCPv6 message only if the validation is successful. 

   With them, the receiver of a DHCPv6 message can verify the sender 
   address of the DHCPv6 message, which improves communication security 
   of DHCPv6 messages. The verification of data integrity and replay 
   protections can also be achieved without the authentication option. 

   The sender can be a DHCPv6 server, a relay agent or a client. So, the 
   end-to-end security protection can be from DHCPv6 servers to relay 
   agents or clients, or from clients to relay agent or DHCPv6 servers. 
   Relay agents MAY add its own Secure DHCPv6 options, too. 

4.1. New Components 

   The components of the solution specified in this document are as 
   follows: 

      - CGAs are used to make sure that the sender of a DHCPv6 message 
        is the "owner" of the claimed address. A public-private key 
        pair has been generated by a node itself before it can claim an 
        address. A new DHCPv6 option, the CGA Parameter Option, is used 
        to carry the public key and associated parameters. 

      - Public key signatures protect the integrity of the DHCPv6 
        messages and authenticate the identity of their sender. 

      - Server Address type of DUID is used to carry server's source 
        address in the relay scenarios. The receiver gets the server's 
        source CGA address for CGA verification. 

4.2. Support for algorithm agility 

   Hash functions are the fundamental of security mechanisms, including 
   CGAs in this document. "...they have two security properties: to be 
   one way and collision free." "The recent attacks have demonstrated 
   that one of those security properties is not true." [RFC4270] It is 
   theoretically possible to perform collision attack Attacks against 
   the "collision-free" property. 

   Following the approach recommended by [RFC4270] and [NewHash], recent 
   analysis shows none of these attacks are currently doable [RFC6273]. 
   "The broken security property will not affect the overall security of 
   many specific Internet protocols, the conservative security approach 
   is to change hash algorithms." [RFC4270] 

   However, these attacks indicate the possibility of future real-world 
   attacks. Therefore, we have to take into account that future attacks 
   will be improved and provide a support for multiple hash algorithms.

   Our mechanisms, in this document, support not only hash algorithm 
   agility but also signature algorithm agility. 

   The support for hash agility within CGAs has been defined in 
   [RFC4982]. The usage of CGAs in this document SHOULD also obey 
   [RFC4982], too. 

   The support for algorithm agility in this document is mainly 
   unilateral notification model from a sender to a receiver. If the 
   receiver cannot support the algorithm provided by the sender, it 
   takes the risk itself. Senders in a same network do not have to 
   upgrade to a new algorithm simultaneously. 

5. Extensions for Secure DHCPv6 

   This section extends DHCPv6. Two new options and a new DUID type have 
   been defined. The new options MUST be supported in the Secure DHCPv6 
   message exchanging. The new DUID type MUST be supported in the relay 
   scenarios. 

5.1. CGA Parameter Option 

   The CGA option allows the verification of the sender's CGAs. The 
   format of the CGA option is described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3

       CGA Parameters   A variable-length field containing the CGA 
                       Parameters data structure described in Section 4 
                       of [RFC3972]. This specification requires that 
                       the public key found from the CGA Parameters 
                       field in the CGA option MUST be that referred by 
                       the Key Hash field in the Signature option. 
                       Packets received with two different keys MUST be 
                       silently discarded.

5.2. Signature Option 

   The Signature option allows public key-based signatures to be 
   attached to a DHCPv6 message. The Signature option could be any place 
   within the DHCPv6 message. It protects all the DHCPv6 header and 
   options, particularly including the CGA option, except for the 
   Signature option and the Authentication Option. The format of the 
   Signature option is described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3

                       signature. The signature value is computed with 
                       the hash algorithm and the signature algorithm, 
                       as described in HA-id and SA-id. The signature 
                       constructed by using the sender's private key 
                       protects the following sequence of octets: 
                        
                       1. The 128-bit CGA Message Type tag value for 
                       Secure DHCPv6, 0x81be a1eb 0021 ce7e caa9 4090 
                       0665 d2e0 02c2. 
                        
                       2. The 128-bit Source IPv6 Address. 
                        
                       3. The 128-bit Destination IPv6 Address. 
                        
                       4. The DHCPv6 message header. 
                        
                       5. All DHCPv6 options except for the Signature 
                       option and the Authentication Option. 
                        
                       6. The content between the option-len field and 
                       the signature field in this Signature option, in 
                       the format described above.

       Padding        This variable-length field contains padding, as 
                       many bytes long as remain after the end of the 
                       signature. 

5.3. DUID-SA Type 

   Server Address Type DUID (DUID-SA) allows IP address of DHCPv6 
   servers can be carried in DHCPv6 message payload.  

   The following diagram illustrates the format of a DUID-SA:

       Type-code       DUID-SA Type (TBA3) 

       Reserved        A 16-bit field reserved for future use. The 
                       value MUST be initialized to zero by the sender, 
                       and MUST be ignored by the receiver. 

       Server Address   The 128-bit IPv6 address of the DHCPv6 server.  

   The Server Address field of DUID-SA, which is the IPv6 address of the 
   DHCPv6 server, MUST be a CGA. 

   In the server-relay-client scenarios, a DHCPv6 server knows a client 
   is behind relay(s) if it receives a Relay-forward DHCPv6 message. 
   Then it will reply a Relay-reply message with the server's source CGA 
   address being carried in the Server Address Type DUID, which is in 
   the payload. In this way, the receiver, a DHCPv6 client can get the 
   server's source CGA address for CGA verification. 

   All the payloads, including DUID-SA, are protected by signature 
   option by the definition of section 5.1 and 5.2.  

6. Processing Rules and Behaviors 

6.1. Processing Rules of Sender 

   The sender of a Secure DHCPv6 message could be a DHCPv6 server, a 
   DHCPv6 relay agent or a DHCPv6 client.

   The node MUST have the following information in order to create 
   Secure DHCPv6 messages: 

       CGA parameters   Any information required to construct CGAs, as 
                       described in [RFC3972]. 

       Keypair        A public-private key pair. The public key used 
                       for constructing the signature MUST be the same 
                       in CGA parameters. 

       CGA flag        A flag that indicates whether CGA is used or  
                       not. 

   To support Secure DHCPv6, the Secure DHCPv6 enabled sender MUST 
   construct the DHCPv6 message following the rules defined  
   in [RFC3315]. The sender MUST use a CGA, which be constructed as 
   specified in Section 4 of [RFC3972], as the source address, unless 
   they are sent with the unspecified source address. 

   A Secure DHCPv6 message MUST contains both the CGA option and the 
   Signature option. 

   The CGA option is constructed according to the rules presented in 
   Section 5.1 and in [RFC3972]. The public key in the field is the one 
   associated with the CGA, which is also the source address in the 
   message header. 

   The Signature option MUST be constructed as explained in Section 5.2. 
   It protects all DHCPv6 options (including the CGA option) except for 
   the Signature option itself and the Authentication Option, the 
   message header and the message payload  

   When constructing a Relay-reply message, a DHCPv6 server MUST include 
   an OPTION_SERVERID [RFC3315] and put its CGA in the Server Address 
   field of the DUID in the OPTION_SERVERID. By applying this rule, the 
   CGA of the DHCPv6 server will not be lost when the Relay-reply 
   message passes relay agents so that the client can verify CGA address 
   and signature. 

6.2. Processing Rules of Receiver 

   By receiving a DHCPv6 message, a Secure DHCPv6 enabled receiver MUST 
   discard the DHCPv6 message if either the CGA option or the Signature 
   option absents. 

   The receiving node MUST verify the source CGA address of the DHCPv6 
   message by using the public key of the DHCPv6 message sender, CGA 
   Parameters and the algorithm described in Section 5 of [RFC3972]. The 
   inputs to the algorithm are the source address, as used in IP header, 
   and the CGA Parameters field. In the relay scenarios, a DHCPv6 server

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6-05.txt        March 2011 
 
   obtains the CGA of a client from the peer address field in the Relay-
   forward message. A DHCPv6 client obtains the CGA of a server from the 
   Server Address field of the DUID in the OPTION_SERVERID. 

   If the CGA verification is successful, the recipient proceeds with a 
   more time-consuming cryptographic check of the signature. Note that 
   even if the CGA verification succeeds, no claims about the validity 
   of the use can be made until the signature has been checked. 

   The receiving node MUST verify the Signature option as follows: the 
   Key Hash field MUST indicate the use of a known public key, the one 
   learned from a preceding CGA option in the same message. The 
   signature field verification MUST show that the signature has been 
   calculated as specified in Section 5.2. 

   Only the messages that get through both CGA and signature 
   verifications are accepted as secured DHCPv6 messages and continue to 
   be handled for their contained DHCPv6 options as defined  
   in [RFC3315]. Messages that do not pass all the above tests MUST be 
   discarded. 

   Furthermore, the node that supports the verification of the Secure 
   DHCPv6 messages MAY record the following information: 

       Minbits        The minimum acceptable key length for public 
                       keys used in the generation of CGAs. An upper 
                       limit MAY also be set for the amount of 
                       computation needed when verifying packets that 
                       use these security associations. The appropriate 
                       lengths SHOULD be set according to the signature 
                       algorithm and also following prudent 
                       cryptographic practice. For example, minimum 
                       length 1024 and upper limit 2048 may be used for 
                       RSA [RSA]. 

6.3. Processing Rules of Relay Agent 

   To support Secure DHCPv6, Relay Agents MUST follow the same 
   processing rules defined in [RFC3315]. 

   A relay agent MAY verify the CGA and signature as a receiver before 
   relay the DHCPv6 message further, following verification procedure 
   define in Section 6.2. In the case of failure, it MUST discard the 
   DHCPv6 message. 

   In the relay scenarios, because relay agent restructures the DHCPv6 
   messages, a downstream receiver would not find the sender's source 
   CGA address in the DHCPv6 message header.

   In the client-relay-server scenarios, "The relay agent copies the 
   source address from the IP datagram in which the message was received 
   from the client into the peer-address field in the Relay-forward 
   message" [RFC3315]. Therefore, the CGA of a client will not be lost 
   during the relay processing from the client to the server. The 
   receiver, a DHCPv6 server, can find the sender's source CGA address 
   in the peer-address field for CGA verification. 

   During the relay processing from the server to the client, when the 
   relay agent constructs the Relay-reply message the server's IP 
   address is replaced by the relay's IP address. In order to make the 
   CGA of the DHCPv6 server reach the client, DUID-SA, described in 
   Section 5.3, MUST be used. A relay will not change the 
   OPTION_SERVERID when processing Relay-reply message from a DHCPv6 
   server, so that the CGA of the DHCPv6 server will not be lost when 
   the Relay-reply message passes the Relay Agent. 

   Relay agents MAY also added its own CGA option and signature option 
   in the Relay-forward or Relay-reply messages. By receiving such 
   messages, the downstream receiver MUST verify CGA and signature from 
   the relay agent, and CGA and signature from the original sender. 

7. Security Considerations 

   This document provides new security features to the DHCPv6 protocol. 

   Using CGA as source addresses of DHCPv6 servers, relays or, also in 
   DHCPv6 message exchanging provides the source address ownership 
   verification and data integrity protection. 

   The Secure DHCPv6 mechanism is based on the precondition that the 
   receiver has known the CGA of senders. For example, to prevent DHCPv6 
   server spoofing, the clients should be pre-notified the DHCPv6 server 
   CGA. The clients may decline the DHCPv6 messages from other servers, 
   which may be fake servers. The pre-notification operation also needs 
   to be protected, which is out of scope. 

   DHCPv6 nodes without CGAs or the DHCPv6 messages that use unspecific 
   addresses cannot be protected. 

   Downgrade attacks cannot be avoided if nodes are configured to accept 
   both secured and unsecured messages. A future specification may 
   provide a mechanism on how to treat unsecured DHCPv6 messages. One 
   simple solution may be that Secure DHCPv6 is mandated on all servers, 
   relay agents and clients on a certain link. 

   As stated in CGA definition [RFC3972], link-local CGAs are more 
   vulnerable because the same prefix is used by all IPv6 nodes. 
   Therefore, when link-local CGAs are used by the DHCPv6 clients, it is 
   recommended to use a slightly higher Sec value, for example Sec=1 for 
 
 
Jiang & Shen         Expires September 15, 2012              [Page 12] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6-05.txt        March 2011 
 
   now. When higher Sec values are used, the relative advantage of 
   attacking link-local addresses becomes insignificant. 

   Impacts of collision attacks on current uses of CGAs are analyzed in 
   [RFC4982]. The basic idea behind collision attacks, as described in 
   Section 4 of [RFC4270], is on the non-repudiation feature of hash 
   algorithms. However, CGAs do not provide non-repudiation features. 
   Therefore, as [RFC4982] points out CGA-based protocols, including 
   Secure DHCPv6 defined in this document, are not affected by collision 
   attacks on hash functions. 

   [RFC6273] has analyzed possible threats to the hash algorithms used 
   in SEND. Since the Secure DHCPv6 defined in this document uses the 
   same hash algorithms in similar way like SEND (except that Secure 
   DHCPv6 has not used PKIX Certificate), analysis results could be 
   applied as well: current attacks on hash functions do not constitute 
   any practical threat to the digital signatures used in the signature 
   algorithm in the Secure DHCPv6. Attacks on CGAs, as described in 
   [RFC4982], will compromise the security of Secure DHCPv6 and they 
   need to be addressed by encoding the hash algorithm information into 
   the CGA as specified in [RFC4982]. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines two new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options, which MUST be 
   assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space for 
   DHCPv6 messages: 

       The CGA Parameter Option (TBA1), described in Section 5.1. 

       The Signature Option (TBA2), described in Section 5.2. 

   This document defines a new DHCPv6 DUID, which MUST be assigned DUID 
   Type values within the DHCPv6 DUID Type numbering space: 

      The DUID-SA (TBA3), described in Section 5.3. 

   This document defines three new registries that have been created and 
   are maintained by IANA. Initial values for these registries are given 
   below. Future assignments are to be made through Standards Action 
   [RFC5226]. Assignments for each registry consist of a name, a value 
   and a RFC number where the registry is defined. 

   Hash Algorithm id (HA-id). The values in this name space are 16-bit 
   unsigned integers. The following initial values are assigned for HA-
   id in this document: 

             Name        |  Value  |  RFCs 
      -------------------+---------+------------ 
            SHA-1        |  0x0000 | this document

   Signature Algorithm id (SA-id). The values in this name space are 16-
   bit unsigned integers. The following initial values are assigned for 
   SA-id in this document: 

             Name        |  Value  |  RFCs 
      -------------------+---------+------------ 
       RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 |  0x0000 | this document 

   Hash Algorithm id for Key Hash (HA-id-KH). The values in this name 
   space are 16-bit unsigned integers. The following initial values are 
   assigned for HA-id-KH in this document: 

             Name        |  Value  |  RFCs 
      -------------------+---------+------------ 
            SHA-1        |  0x0000 | this document 

   This document defines a new 128-bit value under the CGA Message Type 
   [RFC3972] namespace, 0x81be a1eb 0021 ce7e caa9 4090 0665 d2e0 02c2. 
   (The tag value has been generated randomly by the editor of this 
   specification. It may replaced by any IANA-allocated value when the 
   specification is published.)
