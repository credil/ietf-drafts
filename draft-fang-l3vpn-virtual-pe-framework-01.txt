Abstract 

   This document describes a framework for BGP/MPLS L3VPN with virtual
   PE solutions. It provides functional description of the control plane
   and data plane of the virtual PE solutions. It also describes
   interactions among the vPE solutions and other network elements. The
   virtual PE solutions support further control plane and forwarding
   plane separation when compared with traditional L3VPN PE solutions.
   It allows the L3VPN functions to be extended to application end
   devices for large scale and efficient IP application support.

1  Introduction

   Network virtualization is to provide multiple individual network
   services through shared common network resources. Network
   virtualization is not a new concept. For example, BGP/MPLS layer 3
   Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs) [RFC4364] have been widely deployed
   to provide network based virtual private network services. It
   provides routing isolation and forwarding separation for individual
   VPNs, allow IP address overlapping among different VPNs while
   forwarding traffic over common network infrastructure.

   Network virtualization enables the support of multiple isolated
   individual networks over a common network infrastructure. Network
   virtualization is not a new concept. For example, BGP/MPLS IP Virtual
   Private Network (IP VPNs) [RFC4364] have been widely deployed to
   provide network based, service provider provisioned IP VPNs for
   multiple customers with overlapping IP address spaces over a common
   service provider IP/MPLS network. BGP/MPLS IPVPNs provide routing
   isolation among customers and allow address overlapping among
   different VPNs by having per-customer Virtual Routing and Forwarding
   Instance (VRF) at a service provided Edge (PE), while forwarding
   customer traffic over a common IP/MPLS network infrastructure.

   With the advent of compute capabilities and the proliferation of
   virtualization in end devices for systems and applications, PE
   functionality virtualization on such end device is becoming feasible,
   and in some cases attractive for scale and efficiency. Scale and
   efficiency are crutial factors in the cloud computing environment
   supporting various applications and services, and in traditional
   service provider space. 

   The virtual Provider Edge (vPE) solution described in this document
   is to extend the functionality of BGP/MPLS L3VPN to the application
   end device.

   Virtual PE is a PE resides in an end device (e.g., a server) along
   with client/application VMs.

   Through out this document, the term virtual PE (vPE) is used to
   denote BGP/MPLS L3VPN virtual Provider Edge router.

1.2 Motivation

   The recent rapid adoption of Cloud Services by enterprises and the
   phenomenal growth of mobile IP applications accelerate the needs to
   extend the L3VPN capability to the end devices. For example,
   Enterprise customers requested Service Providers to extend and
   integrate their L3VPN services available in the WAN into the new
   Cloud services; large enterprise have existing L3VPN deployment are
   extending them into their data centers; mobile providers are adopting
   L3VPN into their 3GPP Mobile infrastructure are looking to extend the
   L3VPNs to their end device of their call processing center.

   The virtual PE solution described in this document is aimed to meet
   the following key requirement [I-D.fang-l3vpn-end-system-req].

   1) Support end device multi-tenancy, per tenant routing isolation and
   traffic separation.

   2) Support large scale L3VPNs in service network, upto tens of
   thousands of end devices and Millions of VMs in the single service
   network, e.g., a data center. 

   3) Support end-to-end L3VPN connectivity, e.g. L3VPN can start from a
   service network end device, connect to a corresponding L3VPN in the
   WAN, and terminate in another service network end device.

   4) Decoupling control plane and forwarding for network virtualization
   and abstraction.

   L3VPN is the proven technologies which is capable of providing
   routing and forwarding separation, and it is proven with large scale
   deployment (e.g. supporting 7-8 million L3VPN routes in single
   Service Provider networks today). 

   By extending L3VPN solution to the end device with vPE solution,
   application end-to-end (VM to VM, applications to the end user) L3VPN
   connectivity cab be achieved, and well as the true network
   virtualization and abstraction. 

   The architecture and protocols defined in BGP/MPLS IP VPN [RFC4364]
   is the foundation for virtual PE extension. Certain protocol
   extensions or integration may be needed to support the virtual PE
   solutions.

1.3 Scope of the document

   It is assumed that the readers are familiar with BGP/MPLS IP VPN
   [RFC4364] terms and technologies, the base technology and its
   operation are not reviewed in details in this document.

   The following network elements are discussed in this document: the
   concept of BGP L3VPN vPE; the interaction of vPE with other network
   elements, including BGP L3VPN physical PE, physical or virtual BGP
   Route Reflectors (RR, vRR), and Autonomous System Border Router
   (ASBR), Service Network gateway routers, external controllers,
   provisioning/orchestration systems, and the vPE inter-connections
   with other non L3VPN networks.

   The definitions of protocols extensions are out of the scope of this
   document.

2.1 Virtual PE

   As defined in [RFC4364], a L3VPN is created by applying policies to
   form a subset of sites among all sites connected the backbone
   network. It is collection of "sites". A site can be considered as a
   set of IP systems maintain IP inter-connectivity without connecting
   through the backbone. The typical use of L3VPM has been to inter-
   connect different sites of an Enterprise networks through Service
   Provider's L3VPNs in the WAN. 

   A virtual PE (vPE) is a PE instance which resides in one or more
   physical devices, it is commonly placed in a network service (e.g. a
   Data Center) end device (e.g., a Server) where the client/application
   VMs are hosted. The control and forwarding components of the vPE are
   decoupled, they may reside in the same physical device or in
   different physical devices.

   In the case that a vPE is in a Data Center server along with
   client/application VMs, one can view the vPE to VM relationship as a
   typical PE-CE relationship. Unlike a regular physical PE, vPE allows
   L3VPN control plane and forwarding function residing on different
   physical devices. The full MP-BGP control plane may reside on the end
   device, or may be external to the end device, e.g., in a BGP L3VPN
   boarder router (ASBR)/DC gateway router, a Route Reflector (RR), or
   an external controller. 

   Virtual PE solution allows the placement of L3VPN termination point
   right inside the end device (e.g., a server). In this case, the vPE
   to CE (VM) connection is internal to the device. If both control and
   forwarding elements are placed on the end device, L3VPN routing and
   forwarding starts from the end device, the eliminate the needs for
   additional process in the next hop (e.g., layer2 and layer 3
   integration). This approach helps to simplify the operation and
   improve the routing and forwarding efficiency in large scale
   deployment.

   Another important benefit is that vPE solution allows full control
   and forwarding decoupling for scale and achieving true network
   virtualization to allow network abstraction, flexible and dynamic
   policy control, quick service turn up time and VM mobility support.

2.2 Architecture reference model

   Figure 1 illustrate the topology that vPE is reside in the end device
   where the applications are hosted.

             Figure 1. Virtualized Service network with vPE



   The Virtualized Service Network in Figure 1 consists of WAN gateway
   PE devices, transport devices, and end devices. In some networks, it
   is feasible the VPN Gateways may be implemented as vPEs as well.

   Examples of service network may be a network that supports cloud
   computing services, mobile call centers, and SP or enterprise data
   centers.

   Note that the transport devices in the service network in the diagram
   do not participate L3VPNs, they function similar as P routers in MPLS
   back bone, they do not maintain the L3VPN states, and are not L3VPN
   aware.

          Figure 2. VM in end device to VRF in vPE mapping 


   An end device shown in Figure 2 is a virtualized server or system
   which hosts multiple VMs, the virtual PE resides in the end device.
   The vPE supports multiple VRFs, VRF Red, VRF Grn, VRF Yel, VRF Blu,
   etc. Each client or application VM is associated to a particular VRF
   as a member of the particular VPN. For example, VM1 is associated to
   VRF Red, VM2 and VM47 are associated to RFC Grn, etc. Routing
   isolation applies between VPNs for multi-tenancy support. For
   example, VM1 and VM2 can not communicate with each other in a simple
   intranet L3VPN topology as shown in the configuration. 

   The vPE connectivity relationship between vPE and the application VM
   is similar to the PE to CE relationship in a regular BGP L3VPNs.

             Figure 3. Connecting Enterprise CE to DC VM over WAN

   The example of connection from an Enterprise site to application VMs
   through vPE on the end device of a SP provisioned virtualized data
   center.

   There are multiple options for VPN control plane signaling between
   the Gateway PE to vPE on the server within the data center. It can
   use MP-BGP as in regular L3VPN, or use other extensible IP messaging
   protocols defined in IETF, or use controller direct signaling as a
   SDN approach.

   The inter-connection from DC Gateway PE to MPLS WAN may use one of
   the Inter-AS options if they are in different ASes. Option B may be
   more practical for the reasons it is more scalable than Option A, and
   more restricted than Option C. Consider route aggregation with Option
   B if both sides have large number of routes.

   The connection between backbone VPN to VPN CE on the left hand side
   is regular L3VPN connection, e-BGP, or static, or other protocols can
   be used.                                  

3. Control Plane

3.1 vPE Control Plane

   The vPE control plane can be distributed or centralized.

   1) Distributed control plane

   vPE participates in underlay routing through IGP protocols: ISIS or
   OSPF.

   vPE participates in overlay L3VPN control protocol: MP-BGP
   [RFC4364].

   While MP-BGP is the de facto preferred choice between vPE and
   gateway-PE, using extensible signaling messaging protocols can be
   alternative, such technologies have been proposed for this segment of
   signaling [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-end-system].  

   2. Centralized routing controller

   This is a SDN approach. In the virtual PE implementation, not only
   the service network infrastructure and the VPN overlay networks are
   decoupled, but also the vPE control plane and data plane are
   physically decoupled. The control plane directing the data flow may
   reside elsewhere, such a centralized controller. This requires
   standard interface to routing system (IRS). The Interface to Routing
   System (IRS) is work in progress in IETF [I-D.ward-irs-framework],
   [I-D.rfernando-irs-fw-req]. 

3.1 Route server of vPE

   A virtual PE consist the control plane element and the forwarding
   plane element. Since the proposed solution decoupled the two element,
   they may or may not reside on the same physical device.

   The Route Server of L3VPN vPE is a software application that
   implements the BGP/MPLS L3VPN PE control plane functionality.  

   In the case other control/signaling/messaging protocol are used, the
   route server is also the server of the particular protocol(s), it
   interacts with VPN forwarder.

3.3 Use of router reflector

   Modern service networks can be very large in scale. For example, the
   number of VPNs routes in a very large data centers can pass the scale
   of those in SP backbone VPN networks. There are may be tens of
   thousands of end devices in a single service network. 

   Use of Router Reflector (RR) is necessary in large scale L3VPN
   networks to avoid full iBGP mesh among all vPEs and PEs. The L3 VPN
   routes can be partitioned to a set of RRs, the partition techniques
   are detailed in [RFC4364]. 

   When RR is residing in a physical device, e.g., a server, which is
 


<Luyuan Fang>           Expires <Feb. 15, 2013>                [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT              <Document Title>                <Issue Date>


   partitioned to support multi-functions and client/applications VMs,
   the RR becomes virtualized RR (vRR). Since RR's performs control
   plane only, a physical or virtualized server with large scale of
   computing power and memory can be a good candidate as host of vRRs.
   The vRR can also reside be in Gateway PE, or in an end device.
   Redundant RR design is even more important in when using vRR. 

3.4 Use of RT constraint

   The Route Target Constraint (RT Constraint, RTC) [RFC4684] is a
   powerful tool for VPN selective L3VPN route distribution. With RT
   Constraint, only the BGP receiver (e.g, PE/vPE/RR/vRR/ASBRs, etc.)
   with the particular L3VPNs will receive the route update for the
   corresponding VPNs. It is critical to use RT constraint to support
   large scale L3VPN development. 

4. Forwarding Plane

4.1 Virtual Interface

   Virtual Interface (VI) is an interface in an end device which is used
   for connecting the vPE to the application VMs in the end device. The
   latter cab be treated as CEs in the regular L3VPN's view.

4.2 VPN forwarder

   VPN Forwarder is the forwarding component of a vPE.

   The VPN forwarder location options:

   1) within the end device where the virtual interface and application
   VMs are. 

   2) in an external device which the end device connect to, for
   example, a Top of the Rack (ToR) in a data center.

   Multiple factors should be considered for the location of the VPN
   forwarder, including device capability, overall solution economics,
   QoS/firewall/NAT placement, optimal forwarding, latency and
   performance, operation impact, etc. There are design trade offs, it
   is worth the effort to study the traffic pattern and forwarding
   looking trend in your own unique service network as part of the
   exercise.

4.3 Encapsulation

   There are two existing standardized encapsulation/forwarding options
   for BGP/MPLS L3VPN. 
 


<Luyuan Fang>           Expires <Feb. 15, 2013>                [Page 12]

INTERNET DRAFT              <Document Title>                <Issue Date>


       1. MPLS Encapsulation, [RFC3032].

       2. Encapsulating MPLS in IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (GRE), [RFC4023]. 

   The most common BGP/MPLS L3VPNs deployment in SP networks are using
   MPLS forwarding. This requires MPLS, e.g., Label Switched Protocol
   (LDP) [RFC5036] to be deployed in the network. It is proven to scale,
   and it comes with various security mechanisms to protect network
   against attacks. 

   However, the service network environment, such as a data center, is
   different than Service Provider VPN networks or large enterprise
   backbones. MPLS deployment may or may not be feasible. Two major
   challenges for MPLS deployment in this new environment: 1) the
   capabilities of the end devices and the transport/forwarding devices;
   2) the workforce skill set. 

   Encapsulating MPLS in IP or GRE tunnel [RFC4023] may often be more
   practical in most data center, and computing environment. Note that
   when IP encapsulations are used, the associated security
   considerations must be analyzed carefully.

   In addition, there are new encapsulation proposals for service
   network/Data center currently as work in progress in IETF, including
   several UDP based encapsulations proposals and some TCP based
   proposal. These overlay encapsulations can be suitable alternatives
   for a vPE, considering the availability and leverage of support in
   virtual and physical devices.

4.4 Optimal forwarding

   As reported by many large cloud service operators, the traffic
   pattern in their data centers were dominated by East-West across
   subnet traffic (between the end device hosting different applications
   in different subnets) than North-South traffic (going in and out the
   DC to the WAN) or switched traffic within subnets. This is a primary
   reason that many large scale new design has moved away from
   traditional L2 design to L3. 

   When forwarding the traffic within the same VPN, the vPE should be
   able to provide direct communication among the VMs/application
   senders/receivers without the need of going through gateway devices.
   If it is on the same end device, the traffic should not need to leave
   the same device. If it is on different end device, optimal routing
   should be applied. 

   When multiple VPNs need to be accessed to accomplish the task the
 


<Luyuan Fang>           Expires <Feb. 15, 2013>                [Page 13]

INTERNET DRAFT              <Document Title>                <Issue Date>


   user requested (this is common too), the end device virtual
   interfaces should be able to directly access multiple VPNs via use of
   extranet VPN techniques without the need of Gateway facilitation. Use
   BGP L3VPN policy control mechanisms to support this function. 

5. Addressing

5.1 IPv4 and IPv6 support

   Both IPv4 and IPv6 should be supported in the virtual PE solution.

   This may present challenging to older devices, but may not be issues
   to newer forwarding devices and servers. A server is replaced much
   more frequently than a network router/switch in the infrastructure
   network, newer equipment should be capable of IPv6 support. 

5.2 Address space separation

   The addresses used for L3VPNs in the service network should be in
   separate address blocks than the ones used the underlay
   infrastructure of the service network. This practice is to protect
   the service network infrastructure being attacked if the attacker
   gain access of the tenant VPNs.

   Similarity, the addresses used for the service network, e.g., a cloud
   service center of a SP, should be separated from the WAN backbone
   addresses space, for security reasons. 

6.0 Inter-connection considerations 

   There are also deployment scenarios that L3VPN may not be supported
   in every segment of the networks to provide end-to-end L3VPN
   connectivity, a L3VPN vPE may be reachable only via an intermediate
   inter-connecting network, interconnection may be needed in these
   cases.

   When multiple technologies are employed in the overall solution, a
   clear demarcation should be preserved at the inter-connecting points.
   The problems encountered in one domain should not impact the other
   domains.

   From L3VPN point of view: A L3VPN vPE that implements [RFC4364] is a
   component of L3VPN network only. A L3VPN VRF on physical PE or vPE
   contains IP routes only, including routes learnt over the locally
   attached network. 

   As described earlier in this document, the L3VPN vPE should ideally
   be located as close to the "customer" edge devices. For cases, where
 


<Luyuan Fang>           Expires <Feb. 15, 2013>                [Page 14]

INTERNET DRAFT              <Document Title>                <Issue Date>


   this is not possible, simple existing "L3VPN CE connectivity"
   mechanisms should be used, such as static, or direct VM attachments
   such as described in the vCE option below. 

   Consider the following scenarios when BGP MPLS VPN technology is
   considered as whole or partial deployment: 

   Scenario 1: All VPN sites (CEs/VMs) support IP connectivity. The best
   suited BGP solution is to use L3 VPNs [RFC4364] for all sites with PE
   and/or vPE solutions. This is a straightforward case.

   Scenario 2: Legacy layer 2 connectivity must be supported in certain
   sites/CEs/VMs, and the rest sites/CEs/VMs need only 3 connectivity. 

   One can consider to use combined vPE and vCE solution to solved the
   problem. Use L3VPN for all sites with IP connectivity, and use a
   physical or virtual CE (vCE, may reside on the end device) to
   aggregate the L2 sites which, for example, are in a single container
   in a data center. The CE/vCE can be considered as inter-connecting
   point, where the L2 network are terminated and the corresponding
   routes for connectivity of the L2 network are inserted into L3VPN
   VRF. The L2 aspect is transparent to the L3VPN in this case.

   Reducing operation complicity and maintaining the robustness of the
   solution are the primary reasons for the recommendations.

7.  Security Considerations

   vPE solution presented a virtualized L3VPN PE model. There are
   potential implications to L3VPN control plane, forwarding plane, and
   management plane. Security considerations are currently under study,
   will be included in the future revisions. 

8.  IANA Considerations

   None.
