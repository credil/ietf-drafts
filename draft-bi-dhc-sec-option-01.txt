Abstract

   This document defines a new option that can be used by DHCP servers
   to exchange with DHCP clients specific security configuration
   information.  This new option defines a standard parameter format and
   code so that there will be no ambiguity in interoperating the
   information being exchanged and that there will be no issues related
   to interoperability.  It is an option definition extension for DHCPv4
   which should be included in RFC 2132.

1  Introduction

   DHCP provides a framework for passing network configuration
   information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.  Some configuration
   parameters and control information can be carried in DHCP options
   which are defined in [RFC2132], [RFC3046], [RFC3118], [RFC4030], etc.
   When a host that acts as a DHCP client booting up, it can be
   configured with some security policy. Such as, due to the security
   concern, all the configuration packets to and from a client may be
   required to be protected by a secure mechanism, which is typically an
   IPsec secure channel or transport layer security established with the
   server or administrator.

   These security mechanisms require the configuration be initialized at
   the early stage when it is connected to the network. In particular,
   it should be notified any crucial security configuration as soon as
   possible. DHCP is essential for users who want to connect to IP
   networks before they can communicate with other hosts. Among a number
   of indispensable Internet protocols, it provides the most convenient
   way to make configuration extension, which eliminates the manual task
   by a network administrator and duplicate resource assignments. Thus,
   in addition to the essential IP address and network boot servers,
   security configuration is expected to be included in DHCP extension,
   as well.

   Some scenarios that require this kind of secure booting are when DHCP
   clients in wireless base stations are attaching to a wireless network
   infrastructure as defined in [3GPP.33.310]. If secure configuration
   is unavailable, the packets may be dropped by nodes in the network
   such as a firewall or security gateway.  So it is important for the
   host to obtain a set of security information, which is configured in
   the DHCP server prior to the establishment of the security tunnel. 
   Currently, some implementations exchange this security information
   through DHCP vendor-specific options, i.e. OPTION 43.  However, this
   has the usual limitations of requiring the client and server to
   understand these vendor-specific extensions.  Since most of the
   parameters that make up the security configuration are common across
   most clients and servers, having a standardized set of options and
   procedures would be a huge benefit to interoperability.  This
   document defines a new security DHCP option used to exchange the
   security information and related parameters.

   The newly defined option is as follows:

   Option X1: DHCP Security Specific Configuration option

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3  DHCP Security Specific Configuration option

   A DHCP server can use this option to indicate to the DHCP client
   specific configuration information, such as the IP address of the
   security gateway that is used to establish IPsec tunnel within the
   enterprise network, multiple IP addresses of the client that are used
   within the enterprise network.  The information contained in the
   specific configuration area of this option includes one or more
   attribute values that are assigned by IANA.  The information which is
   contained in these attribute data fields of this option contains the
   detailed specific configuration information for the DHCP client.

   This option may be used wherever DHCP options may be used, as
   specified in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132].  It is most meaningful in the
   messages between DHCP client and DHCP server, such as, DHCPOFFER and
   DHCPACK.  The format of the option X1 is as follows:

   If the DHCP client is required to securely boot, the address or FQDN
   of Security gateway for IPsec establishment is required.
   Additionally, if the security policy dictates, the ACL policy and
   multiple IP address of the DHCP client for different usage are also
   required.

   In this document, the minimum set of security-specific attribute is
   specified.

   IP address of the DHCP client: it indicates the IP address of the
   DHCP client.  In current specification defined in [RFC2131], the IP
   address of client is allocated in yiaddr field, but only one address
   can be obtained.  If multiple IP addresses are needed, such as,
   transport IP, service IP or public interface IP address and
   enterprise network IP address, this option can be used.  The
   security-specific attribute data comprise the different separate
   items.  The definition of the sub-security-specific is listed as
   follows.

   Public interface IP: it indicates the public interface IP address of
   the DHCP client.

   Enterprise IP: it indicates the IP address of the DHCP client used
   within the enterprise network.  Each of the attributes is optional
   and available according to local policy.

   Security-gateway ID: it indicates the security information of the
   security gateway.  If the client is configured with security policy,
   the value is mandatory to use.  Else, it cannot obtain the Security
   gateway information to establish IPsec tunnel.  And it is mainly used
   with IPsec.

   IP address: it indicates the IP address of the security gateway.

   FQDN: it indicates the FQDN of the security gateway

   Either of these two sub-security-specific attributes can be contained
   according to local policy.

   ACL policy: it indicates the ACL policy attribute.  And six elements
   of the ACL policy are contained in the series of sub-security-
   specific attributes.  The six elements which contains IP address,
   transport port number, protocol, and DSCP.  The client will be
   configured with an ACL to filter potentially dangerous packets.  Only
   packets that match the ACL parameters are allowed to pass.

   PKI IP: it indicates the IP address of RA/CA

   RSV: If is not used, it should be set to zero.

   Private: It is for private use.

   These attributes are for the host, the configuration of all of base
   stations are the same when initially dispatched from the factory,
   when the server receive the client ID, the server will know whether
   the client needs to be configured with security, and then it will
   send the security information to the client.  For the client, it MUST
   identify the option.

         Figure 2.  The format of Sub-security-specific option

   Sub-security-specific attribute type: type code of the sub-security-
   specific attribute, i.e., for security-specific attribute, it
   includes the source IP address, destination address, source port
   number, destination port number, protocol and DSCP in order.  The
   data-len is one octet long and specifies the length of the sub-
   security-specific data.

   This option contains the information corresponding to one or more
   security-specific code number.  Multiple instances of this option may
   be present and must be concatenated in accordance with [RFC3396]. The
   definition of the information carried in this option is defined
   uniformly.  The security-specific attribute information indicated the

   security information type.  For example, a DHCP client indicates
   security configurations with the same code number that can be
   interpreted by different DHCP servers.  As the security-specific code
   is uniform and standard, no ambiguity interpretation can occur.  A
   security-specific code number is unique and only occur once in the
   option and should be treated independently.  This option can also
   contains one or more encapsulated options that defined in [RFC2132].

   DHCP client can request the configuration information from DHCP
   server by sending DHCP request message.  DHCP server allocates the
   configuration information to DHCP client according to the client ID.
   i.e., DHCP server can know whether this connecting client needs to be
   configured security configuration by client ID, which can be carried
   in option 60 specified in [RFC2132].  If the security configuration
   is needed, the defined security-specific option will be sent back to
   the client from DHCP server in DHCPOFFER.  If this option is used,
   different DHCP clients implemented by different vendors have good
   interoperability.  The DHCP server needs only to support one
   standardized format which reduces complexity and enhances
   performance.

   If the DHCP client is configured with a security policy, all of the
   attributes listed in the figure MUST be carried in the newly defined
   option in DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUESTmessages.  And DHCP server MUST
   allocate all the request configuration attribute values according to
   the received attribute type and format in the DHCP response messages.

   Use of security-specific information allows enhanced operation,
   utilizing additional features in a DHCP implementation.  Servers not
   equipped to interpret the security-specific information sent by a
   client MUST ignore it.  Clients that do not receive desired security-
   specific information MUST ignore it and initiate another DHCP
   operation.


4  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new security option used by DHCP servers and
   DHCP clients to exchange security configuration information.  And, if
   the additional configuration information is sensitive in nature,
   consideration needs to be taken on how to protect it.

5  IANA Considerations

   There may be IANA consideration for taking additional value for the
   option.  The value of the protocol field needed to be assigned from
   the numbering space.
