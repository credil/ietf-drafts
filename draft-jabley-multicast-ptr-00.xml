    <abstract>
      <t>The mapping of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to names using the
	Domain Name System (DNS) is colloquially known as "Reverse
	Mapping".  Reverse Mapping support for registered multicast
	address assignments in IPv4 is currently incomplete and
	ad-hoc; in IPv6 there is no support at all.</t>

      <t>This document describes procedures to be followed that will
        result in more systematic and predictable support for Reverse
        Mapping for IPv4 multicast address assignments, and introduces
        analogous support for IPv6.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS), as originally specified in
	<xref target="RFC1034"/> and <xref target="RFC1035"/>,
	provides support for the mapping of IPv4 addresses to names
	using a namespace convention within the IN-ADDR.ARPR domain
	and the PTR resoure record type.</t>

      <t>The analogous mapping of IPv6 address to names is specified in
        <xref target="RFC3596"/>, adopting a similar namespace convention
        within the IP6.ARPA domain.</t>

      <t>Multicast addresses are assigned by the IANA, and assignments
        are documented in various IANA registries.</t>

      <t>For IPv4, Reverse Mapping of assigned multicast addresses
	to names has historically been provided in an ad-hoc and
	incomplete fashion, without tight coordination with IANA
	multicast address assignment processes. Names assigned to
	IPv4 multicast addresses have been chosen somewhat arbitrarily
	within the MCAST.NET domain. For IPv6, no Reverse Mapping
	is provided.</t>

      <t>This document describes procedures to be followed by the IANA
        to support predictable and consistent Reverse Mapping for 
        registered multicast addresses in IPv4 and IPv6.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="General Approach">
      <t>This document specifies extensions to existing IPv4 and
        IPv6 multicast registries to include a mandatory column
        "DNS Label". This field is required to be popluated with
        a unique, valid DNS label for all future multicast address
        assignments except in the case where reverse mapping for
        an address is explicitly not desirable.</t>

      <t>The procedures at the IANA relating to multicast address
         assignment are extended to include the provisioning of
	 appropriate changes in the DNS at the time of registration
	 or de-registration of any multicast addresses.  Specific
	 actions requested of the IANA are described in <xref
	 target="iana_considerations"/>.</t>

      <t>Names for multicast addresses are assigned under MCAST.ARPA
        for IPv4 addresses, and MCAST6.ARPA for IPv6 addresses.
        The naming schemes to bs used in each case are described
        in <xref target="naming_scheme"/>. The use of MCAST.ARPA
	rather than MCAST.NET is discussed in <xref
        target="using_arpa"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Naming Scheme" anchor="naming_scheme">
      <section title="IPv4 Multicast Addresses">
        <t>Each assigned IPv4 multicast address has an accompanying
          DNS Label. The name associated with an IPv4 multicast address
          with DNS Label SOMENAME is SOMENAME.MCAST.ARPA.</t>

        <t>For example, suppose the assigned IPv4 multicast address
	  224.0.1.1 has the DNS Label "NTP". The address 224.0.1.1
	  maps to the name "NTP.MCAST.ARPA"; the name "NTP.MCAST.ARPA"
	  maps to the address 224.0.1.1.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 Multicast Addresses">
        <t>Each assigned IPv6 multicast address has an accompanying
          DNS Label ("Address Label").</t>

        <t>IPv6 multicast addresses may be of fixed or variable
          scope. The naming scheme for these addresses incorporates
	  a scope identifier using an additional DNS label ("Scope
	  Label"), specified in a dedicated registry (see <xref
	  target="scope_registry"/>). Both fixed and variable scope
          multicast addresses use the same naming scheme.</t>

        <t>The name associated with an IPv6 multicast address
          with Scope Label SCOPE and Address Label SOMENAME is
          SOMENAME.SCOPE.MCAST6.ARPA.</t>

        <t>For example, suppose ff01::1 is an assigned IPv6 multicast address
	  with Scope Label "NODE-LOCAL" and Address Label "ALL-NODES".
	  The address ff01::1 maps to the name
	  "ALL-NODES.NODES-LOCAL.MCAST6.ARPA"; the name
	  "ALL-NODES.NODES-LOCAL.MCAST6.ARPA" maps to the address
	  ff01::1.</t>

        <t>The variable-scope multicast address ff0x::fb will have
	  different Reverse Mapping depending on the scope specified
	  in the address (i.e. the value of x), although the Address
	  Label in each case will be the same ("MDNSV6"). The
	  Site-Local address ff05::fb has an associated Scope Label
	  "SITE-LOCAL", and is therefore named
	  MDNSV6.SITE-LOCAL.MCAST6.ARPA.  The Link-Local address
	  ff02::fb has an associated Scope Label "LINK-LOCAL" and
	  hence is named MDNSV6.LINK-LOCAL.MCAST6.ARPA.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Use of MCAST.ARPA" anchor="using_arpa">
      <t>Use of the MCAST.ARPA domain rather than MCAST.NET for
        IPv4 multicast addresses is specified for the same reasons
        that led IP6.INT to be superceded by "IP6.ARPA" <xref
        target="RFC3152"/>.</t>

      <t>It is prudent to assume that hard-coded assumptions about
        names in MCAST.NET exist, and will persist for some time.
        This document specifies that names in the MCAST.ARPA domain
	also be available in the MCAST.NET domain, to provide support
	for software with those assumptions. Ongoing support for
	the MCAST.NET zone is described in <xref target="mcast_net"/>.</t>

      <t>It is possible that in the future empirical measurement will
        confirm that the use of names under MCAST.NET is no longer
        required and that provisioning of the MCAST.NET domain
        can safely cease. This document provides no such measurement and
        makes no such recommendation, however.</t>

    <section title="IAB Considerations" anchor="iab_considerations">
      <t>This document proposes a delegation within the ARPA domain,
	and, in accordance with <xref target="RFC3172"/>, IAB review
	and approval of the delegation of MCAST.ARPA and MCAST6.ARPA
	as described in <xref target="delegation"/> is required.</t>

      <t>Once IAB approval has been obtained, this section may be
        removed prior to publication or updated to include text that
        confirms the IAB's decision, at the IAB's discretion.</t>
