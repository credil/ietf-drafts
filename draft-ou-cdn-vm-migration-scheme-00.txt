    Content Delivery Network Based Virtual Machine Migration Scheme
                  draft-ou-cdn-vm-migration-scheme-00

Abstract

   Virtual machine migration is a critical requirement in today's data
   centers to support services dynamically deployed in distributed
   infrastructures.  To keep the uniform environment required by
   application software, large number of networking based solutions have
   been presented to provide data center interconnection for virtual
   resource management.  Aiming at simplifying networking complexities
   in off-site service deployment, this document presents a framework
   based on content delivery network for supporting virtual machine
   migration over the legacy wide area network.

Internet-Draft        CDN based VM Migration scheme         October 2012


1.  Introduction

   In an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) system, IT infrastructure is
   deployed in a provider's data center as virtual machine (VM).
   Managing a VM's full life-cycle mainly includes setting up networks
   dynamically for groups of VMs and their storage requirements, such as
   VM disk image deployment or on-the-fly software environment creation.
   With IaaS cloud growing popularity, VM migration technology has been
   widely used in off-site database backup, new services deployment and
   server system maintenance or upgrade.

   Basically, VM migration is categorized into two types: live-migration
   (real-time) and off-line migration (non real-time).  The former
   migration procedure is typically controlled by VM manager, which
   involves real-time status synchronization, including networks, memory
   and storage, between two hosts where VMs locate.  Due to strict
   requirement to network performance, most former methods (application-
   level or process-level) are only limited within a data center instead
   of data center interconnection (DCI) scope to prevent poor migration
   performance or system exception.  Not migrating VM in run-time, the
   later VM migration can be implemented by sending VM image files
   (static disk image and dynamic snapshot) from source host to
   destination.  That is to say, file-level data transfer between hosts
   is efficient enough for non real-time VM migration when network
   quality is favorable.  It also means dependence on expensive and
   sophisticated DCI solutions is largely reduced.  As a fast file
   delivery and cache system, content delivery network (CDN) provides
   not only high performance data transfer channel but also easy-to-go
   control plane.  Thus, DCI solution should take CDN based scheme into
   consideration for VM migration.

   This document only focus on overall framework, scenarios and
   implementation consideration for CDN based VM migration.  Completed
   comparisons between VM migration approaches and related networking
   issues are outside the scope of this document.  Motivation behind
   this document can be concluded as follows:.

   1.Provide a simple transition scheme before evolving to future's cost
   efficient DCI solution in large scale, and give a simple option to
   those who don't want to take risk of complex DCI in current phrase.

   2.Protect investment on legacy infrastructure.  Typically, for some
   Asia telecom carries, who not only own broadband network and data
   center infrastructure but also a national wide CDN.  Comparing CDN
   system upgrade, it is a big burden to construct a new DCI specified
   data plane over underlying broadband network in the near future.

2.  Terminology

   Virtual Resource Node (VRN): Data centers in which VM migration
   happens are abstracted as VRN.  VRN consists of host, storage and
   distributed file system in a data center.  Before migrating from one
   to another, virtual resource corresponding to VM is stored in the
   format of VM image files in VRN, and then is delivered from source
   VRN to destination VRN across network.

   Cloud Virtual Machine Manager (CVMM): Different from typical virtual
   machine management (VMM) located in data center internally, CVMM is
   an infrastructure manager that deploys virtualized services on both
   local pool of resources and external IaaS cloud to support virtual
   resource life-cycle management.

   CDN Management Node (CMN): CMN provides content management for cache
   node in CDN network, including content adding, content routing,
   content delivery, resource discovery function.  Only one CMN in a CDN
   system.

   CDN Cache Node (CCN): CCN carries VM images for migration received
   from source VRN, and deliver those images to destination VRN via its
   high speed data channel provided by CDN interconnected network which
   is typically constructed over legacy L3 network.  Any cache node in
   legacy CDN system could be a CCN which could receive/deliver image
   files from/to VRN.Thus, the CCN is also partitioned into source CCN
   and destination CCN.

   Resource Migration Gateway (RMG): RMG is a control system that
   supports virtual resources in a cloud to migrate across wide area
   network via CDN system.  Its interface with CVMM parses migration
   instruction and reports related migration status.  While the
   interface with CMN is used to apply for data channel and cache space
   from CDN for arriving VM images.  RMG also finishes some conversion
   or mapping operation, including content /image format, content/image
   ID, content location and content routing, between CDN system and VM
   file system.

        Figure 1 CDN Based VM Migration Architecture

   The functional architecture (as depicted in the Figure 1) describes
   how RMG, cloud manager and CDN management element collaborate on
   fulfilling VM migration via CDN system which set up over legacy
   physical L2/L3 network.  Here, one key role of the RMG is to decouple
   the signaling dependency between cloud system and CDN system.  In
   terms of mechanism outlined below, the VM images are able to be
   transferred from upper cloud layer (SRC VRN) to CDN and network
   layer, and then back to the cloud layer (DEST VRN).  The typical
   workflow is summarized as following steps:

   1.  CVMM receives VM migration instruction in two ways: manually
   requested by cloud administrator or automatically triggered by user
   applications.  In either case, CVMM records current virtual resource
   status and clones necessary disk image from the physical machine that
   the VM is hosted.

   2.  CVMM identifies this migration operation belong to local or
   remote.  If it is remote migration, CVMM sends a migration request
   which also contains source and destination information about VRNs.

   3.  RMG checks its internal VRN-CCN mapping table to get information
   about the CCN directly connected with SRC or DEST VRN.  Then, RMG
   sends request to CMN with dedicated protocol which includes SRC and
   DEST nodes information about CCN and size or identification of VM

   image.

   4.  Receiving message from RMG, CMN first requires whether the DEST
   CCN or network is busy or not.  If the DEST is congested, CMN will
   suggest RMG to modify the destination for VRN.  Otherwise, it will
   check its internal database to judge if CDN system has cached such
   image file before.  If there is an existing image copy, CMN will push
   the image file to DEST CCN, and then informs RMG to receive the image
   from the VRN connected.

   5.  If there is no VM image in CDN system at current phrase, CMN
   thereafter responds the RMG's requesting for image transport.  And
   RMG send permitting message for VM migration to CVMM as well.
   Finally, CVMM informs VRNs (SRC and DEST) to start up its file
   transfer process and keep status for both.  CVMM, RMG and CMN
   maintain necessary dialog during images transfer phrase to refresh
   status messages.

   6.  Once the DEST VRN successfully receives image file from DEST CCN,
   new VM is created in the DEST VRN's internal physical host.

   Typically, a service deployed in a data center is hosted in different
   servers or VMs which might belong to different administrative domain.
   And these virtual or physical resources are orchestrated by cloud
   manager.  Hence all requirements shown in this scenario for service
   migration are able to be abstracted at the granularity of VMs.
   Specifically speaking, it is a batch process for multiple VM images
   transfer via high speed network.

   This scenario demonstrates how to implement batch migration for VMs
   images when dedicated service moves from one data center to another
   geographically separated in two cities.  As depicted in Figure 4,
   image data "v1"and "v2"are cloned in the Src VRN as "v1'"and "v2'".
   Image copies and then are fast send to Dest VRN over CDN system in
   which the high speed links for cache nodes are pre-constructed and
   carefully optimized over physical network.  Obviously, VM image
   transfer over CDN system is better than VRN to VRN connected network
   in quality and bandwidth.

   Most steps for negotiation protocol and data transfer are the same as
   workflows mentioned in Section 3.1.

   6.  Once the DEST VRN successfully receives image file from DEST CCN,
   new VM is created in the DEST VRN's internal physical host.

                 Figure 5 VM Image Delivered to Multiple VRNs 
                          (Off-site Backup Service)

   This case illustrates an off-site disaster backup service - that is,
   how to simultaneously deliver VM image to multiple data centers in
   different cities.

   All major steps for control protocol are mentioned in Section 3.1.
   According to steps in Section 3.1, the management platform will
   negotiate mutually to discover VRN-CCN pairs matched in terms of
   mapping table in the RMG before a real migration operation occurs.
   Once the VRN-CCN pairs are determined, as shown in Figure 5, Src VRN
   which locates in city A will receive backup instruction from CVMM.
   It clones the coresponding VM image as "v'" and transfer it to Src
   CCN connected directly.

   Even if the image "v'" should be sent to two destination nodes, Src
   VRN just send "v'" to Src CCN one time only.  Because Src CCN
   "understands" this migration operation with a fork destination.
   Therefore, the "v' " image will be duplicated inside Src CCN and
   delivered to corresponding Dest CCNs along with the routes pre-
   configured by CDN system.  Finally, Dest VRN fetches the same image
   "v'" respectively from Dest CCNs connected.  The more backup nodes in
   the backup services, the higher transfer efficiency will be gained
   from CDN based migration scheme mentioned in this document.

4.3.  Virtual Desktop Migration

   This section illustrates a experience enhancement application for
   virtual desktop user, which migrates a remote virtual desktop (VM
   instance) to a local host existing in local CCN.

   TBD


5.  Implementation Consideration

5.1.  Discussion

   1.  Status Synchronization

   The effort to implement this scheme mainly exists in control
   protocols between CVMM and RMG, RMG-CMN, and necessary modification
   on CVMM and CMN system.  Such modification may include revising
   status synchronization mechanism in VMM and re-defining content
   discovery flow in CMN.  Since the scheme we presented is an off-line
   oriented solution, modification work for migration operations in a
   CVMM are kept in application level rather than revising hypervisor
   level.

   2.  Live-migration or offline-migration

   One may argue that the scheme mentioned in this document is only
   suitable for offline-migration cases in which active VMs must be shut
   down by cloud manager before migration initiates.  In view of poor
   performance in WAN environment and complexity for DCI technologies,
   offline-migration across WAN is acceptable choice.  Considering
   existence of diverse migration levels, such as progress-level or
   memory-level, a revised approach for this CDN based scheme is to use
   live-migration technologies for real status synchronization as
   supplement.  While those static big image files are still transferred
   in term of our scheme.

   3.  Routing, Addressing and Content Discovery

   This scheme just maintains a simple table to configure static mapping
   between content and routing manually.  It cannot deal with dynamic
   adding/removing either CDN nodes or VRNs.  Moreover, maintaining two
   resource systems information and related location/routing
   information, RMG is easy to become the bottleneck in the whole
   system.

   4.  Engineering issues

   This scheme is only suitable for those hosting service providers or
   carriers who retain their own CDN to improve utilization of CDN
   system and to avoid large scale investment on DCI devices at current
   phrase.

   Another issue is that not all data centers are close enough to CDN
   cache nodes.  Thus, connections between data centers and CDN node
   will become a burden for operators

   5.  Others

   TBD

5.2.  Experimental Work

   TBD (Part of initial experiment work have been done to validate
   mechanism of the scheme, which is based on open source software for
   CDN and cloud management )


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
