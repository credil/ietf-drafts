Abstract

   EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP
   network. However, there are scenarios in which inter-subnet
   forwarding among hosts/VMs across different IP subnets is required,
   while maintaining the multi-homing capabilities of EVPN. This
   document describes an IRB solution based on EVPN to address such
   requirements.

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN      July 15, 2013


1  Introduction

   EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
   for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP
   network. However, there are scenarios where, in addition to intra-
   subnet forwarding, inter-subnet forwarding is required among
   hosts/VMs across different IP subnets at the EVPN PE nodes, also
   known as EVPN NVE nodes throughout this document, while maintaining
   the multi-homing capabilities of EVPN. This document describes an IRB
   solution based on EVPN to address such requirements.

1.1 Traditional Inter-Subnet Forwarding

   The inter-subnet communication is traditionally achieved at the L3
   Gateway nodes where all the inter-subnet communication policies are
   enforced. Even for different subnets belonging to one IP-VPN or
   tenant, traffic may need to go through FW or IPS between the trusted
   and un-trusted zones.

   Some operators may prefer centralized approach, i.e. only have a set
   of default L3 gateways (whose redundancy is typically achieved by
   VRRP) for all inter-subnet traffic to go through.  Usually there are
   FW, IPS, or other network appliances directly attached to the
   centralized L3 Gateway nodes. The centralized approach makes it
   easier for maintaining consistent policies and less prone to
   configuration errors.  However, such centralized approach suffers
   from a major drawback of requiring all traffic to be hair-pinned to
   the L3GW nodes. 

   Some operators may prefer fully distributed L3 gateway design, e.g.
   allowing all NVEs to have the policies to route traffic across
   subnets. Under this design, all traffic between hosts attached to one
   NVE can be routed locally, thus avoiding traffic hair-pinning issue
   at the centralized L3GW. The perceived drawback of this fully
   distributed approach may be the extra effort required in maintaining
   policy consistence across all the NVEs. 

   Some operators may prefer somewhere in the middle, i.e. allowing NVEs
   to route traffic across only selected subnets. For example, allow
   NVEs to route traffic among subnets belonging to one tenant or one
   security zone. 


1.2. Scenarios of EVPN NVEs as L3GW

   When an EVPN NVE node is not the L3GW for the subnets attached, the
   EVPN NVE performs only L2 switching function for the traffic
   initiated from or destined to the hosts attached to the NVE.

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN      July 15, 2013


   Some EVPN NVEs can be the default L3GWs for some subnets. In this
   situation, the EVPN NVEs can route traffic across the subnets for
   which they are default L3GWs. 

   When there are multiple subnets attached to an EVPN NVE, some of the
   subnets could have the EVPN NVE as their L3GW, some other subnets
   don't have the NVE as their L3GW. For example: "Subnet-X" can
   communicate with "Subnet-Y" via NVE "A", but "Subnet-X" can't
   communicate with "Subnet-Z" via NVE "A". So when the "Subnet-X" needs
   to communicate with "Subnet-Z", the traffic might need to be routed
   through another device (e.g. FW, IPS, or another L3GW node). 

   1. When the EVPN NVE is the L3GW for "Subnet -X", hosts within
   "Subnet-X" will have the NVE's IRB MAC address as their default GW
   MAC address when they send data frames towards targets in different
   subnets.

   2. When the EVPN NVE is not the L3GW for "Subnet-Y", hosts within
   "Subnet-Y", (even though still attached to the NVE), will use their
   own designated L3GW MAC address (that is different from the NVE's IRB
   address) in data frames destined towards targets in different
   subnets.


2  Inter-Subnet Forwarding Scenarios 

   The inter-subnet forwarding scenarios performed by an EVPN NVE can be
   divided into the following five categories. The last scenario, along
   with their corresponding solutions, are described in [EVPN-IPVPN-
   INTEROP]. The solutions for the first four scenarios are the focus of
   this document.  

   1. Switching among EVPN instances within a DC

   2. Switching among EVPN instances in different DCs without route
   aggregation

   3. Switching among  EVPN instances in different DCs with route
   aggregation

   4. Switching among  IP-VPN sites and EVPN instances with route
   aggregation

   5. Switching among IP-VPN sites and EVPN instances without route
   aggregation


   In the above scenario, the term "route aggregation" refers to the

   case where for a given EVI/VRF a node situated at the WAN edge of the
   data center network behaves as a default gateway for all the
   destinations that are outside the data center. The absence of route
   aggregation refers to the scenario where a given EVI/VRF within a
   data center has (host) routes to individual VMs that are outside of
   the data center.

   In the case (4) the WAN edge node also performs route aggregation for
   all the destinations within its own data center, and acts as an
   interworking unit between EVPN and IP VPN (it implements both EVPN
   and IP VPN functionality).

                  Figure 2: Interoperability Use-Cases

   In what follows, we will describe scenarios 3 through 6 in more
   detail.

2.1 Switching among EVIs within a DC

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between hosts (e.g. VMs)
   in the same data center, where those hosts belong to different IP
   subnets. All these subnets are part of the same IP VPN. Each subnet
   is associated with a single EVPN, where each such EVPN is realized by
   a collection of EVIs residing on appropriate NVEs.

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN      July 15, 2013


   As an example, consider VM3 and VM5 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two VMs where VM3 belongs to
   the IP3 subnet whereas VM5 belongs to the IP5 subnet. Both IP3 and
   IP5 subnets are part of the same IP VPN. NVE2 has an EVI3 associated
   with IP3 subnet and NVE3 has an EVI5 associated with the IP5 subnet.


2.2 Switching among EVIs in different DCs without route aggregation

   This case is similar to that of section 2.1 above albeit for the fact
   that the hosts belong to different data centers that are
   interconnected over a WAN (e.g. MPLS/IP PSN). The data centers in
   question here are seamlessly interconnected to the WAN, i.e., the WAN
   edge does not maintain any host/VM-specific addresses in the
   forwarding path.

   As an example, consider VM3 and VM6 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two VMs where VM3 belongs to
   the IP3 subnet whereas VM6 belongs to the IP6 subnet. NVE2 has an
   EVI3 associated with IP3 subnet and NVE4 has an EVI6 associated with
   the IP6 subnet. Both IP3 and IP6 subnets are part of the same IP VPN
   and both EVI3 and EVI6 are associated with their VRFs for that IP
   VPN.


2.3 Switching among EVIs in different DCs with route aggregation

   In this scenario, connectivity is required between hosts (e.g. VMs)
   in different data centers, and those hosts belong to different IP
   subnets. What makes this case different from that of Section 2.2 is
   that (in the context of a given EVI/VRF) at least one of the data
   centers in question has a gateway as the WAN edge switch. Because of
   that, the EVIs/VRFs within each data center need not maintain (host)
   routes to individual VMs outside of the data center.

   As an example, consider VM1 and VM5 of Figure 2 above. Assume that
   connectivity is required between these two VMs where VM1 belongs to
   the IP1 subnet whereas VM5 belongs to the IP5 subnet thus IP1 and IP5
   subnets belong to the same IP VPN. NVE3 has an EVI5 associated with
   the IP5 subnet and NVE1 has an EVI1 associated with the IP1 subnet.
   Both EVI1 and EVI5 have associated with their VRFs that belong to the
   IP VPN that includes IP1 and IP5 subnets. Due to the gateway at the
   edge of DCN 1, NVE1 does not have the address of VM5 in its VRF table
   but instead it has a default route in its VRF with the next-hop being
   the GW.

2.4 Switching among IP-VPN sites and EVIs with route aggregation

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN      July 15, 2013


   In this scenario (within a context of a particular EVPN instance),
   connectivity is required between hosts (e.g. VMs) in a data center
   and hosts in an enterprise site that belongs to a given IP-VPN. The
   NVE within the data center is an EVPN NVE, whereas the enterprise
   site has an IP-VPN PE. Furthermore, the data center in question has a
   gateway as the WAN edge switch. Because of that, the NVE in the data
   center does not need to maintain individual IP prefixes advertised by
   enterprise sites (by IP-VPN PEs).

   As an example, consider end-station H1 and VM2 of Figure 2. Assume
   that connectivity is required between the end-station and the VM,
   where VM2 belongs to the IP2 subnet that is realized using EVPN,
   whereas H1 belongs to an IP VPN site connected to PE1 (PE1 maintains
   an IP VPN VRF associated with that IP VPN). NVE1 has an EVI2
   associated with the IP2 subnet. Moreover, NVE1 maintains a VRF
   associated with EVI2.  PE1 originates a VPN-IP route that covers H1.
   The gateway at the edge of DCN1 performs interworking function
   between IP-VPN and EVPN.  As a result of this, a default route in the
   VRF associated with EVI2, pointing to the gateway as the next hop,
   and a route to the VM2  (or maybe IP2 subnet) on the H1's VRF on PE1
   are sufficient for the connectivity between H1 and VM2.

3 Default L3 Gateway Addressing

3.1 Homogeneous Environment

   This is an environment where all NVEs to which an EVPN instance could
   potentially be attached (or moved), perform inter-subnet switching. 
   Therefore, inter-subnet traffic can be locally switched by the EVPN
   NVE connecting the VMs belonging to different subnets.   

   To support such inter-subnet forwarding, the NVE behaves as an IP
   Default Gateway from the perspective of the attached end-stations
   (e.g. VMs). Two models are possible, as discussed in [DC-MOBILITY]:

   1. All the EVIs of a given EVPN instance use the same anycast default
   gateway IP address and the same anycast default gateway MAC address.
   On each NVE, this default gateway IP/MAC address correspond to the
   IRB interface of the EVI associated with that EVPN instance. 

   2. Each EVI of a given EVPN instance uses its own default gateway IP
   and MAC addresses, and these addresses are aliased to the same
   conceptual gateway through the use of the Default Gateway extended
   community as specified in [EVPN], which is carried in the EVPN MAC
   Advertisement routes. On each NVE, this default gateway IP/MAC
   address correspond to the IRB interface of the EVI associated with
   that EVPN instance.

INTERNET DRAFT    IP Inter-Subnet Forwarding in E-VPN      July 15, 2013


   Both of these models enable a packet forwarding paradigm where inter-
   subnet traffic can bypass the VRF processing on the egress (i.e.
   disposition) NVE. The egress NVE merely needs to perform a lookup in
   the associated EVI and forward the Ethernet frames unmodified, i.e.
   without rewriting the source MAC address.  This is different from
   traditional IRB forwarding where a packet is forwarded through the
   bridge module followed by the routing module on the ingress NVE, and
   then forwarded through the routing module followed by the bridging
   module on the egress NVE. For inter-subnet forwarding using EVPN, the
   routing module on the egress NVE can be completely bypassed.

   It is worth noting that if the applications that are running on the
   hosts (e.g. VMs) are employing or relying on any form of MAC
   security, then the first model (i.e. using anycast addresses) would
   be required to ensure that the applications receive traffic from the
   same source MAC address that they are sending to.

3.1 Heterogeneous Environment

   For large data centers with thousands of servers and ToR (or Access)
   switches, some of them may not have the capability of maintaining or
   enforcing policies for inter-subnet switching. Even though policies
   among multiple subnets belonging to same tenant can be simpler, hosts
   belonging to one tenant can also send traffic to peers belonging to
   different tenants or security zones. A L3GW not only needs to enforce
   policies for communication among subnets belonging to a single
   tenant, but also it needs to know how to handle traffic destined
   towards peers in different tenants. Therefore, there can be a mixed
   environment where an NVE performs inter-subnet switching for some
   EVPN instances but not others.   


4  Operational Models for Inter-Subnet Forwarding

4.1 Among EVPN NVEs within a DC

   When an EVPN MAC advertisement route is received by the NVE, the IP

   packet must be forwarded, in addition to an adjacency that contains a
   MAC rewrite and an MPLS label stack. The MAC rewrite holds the MAC
   address associated with the destination host (as populated by the
   EVPN MAC route), instead of the MAC address of the next-hop NVE. The
   ingress NVE then rewrites the destination MAC address in the packet
   with the address specified in the adjacency. It also rewrites the
   source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address. The ingress
   NVE, then, forwards the frame to the next-hop (i.e. egress) NVE after
   encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. Note that this label
   stack includes the LSP label as well as the EVI label that was
   advertised by the egress NVE. When the MPLS encapsulated packet is
   received by the egress NVE, it uses the EVI label to identify the
   bridge-domain table. It then performs a MAC lookup in that table,
   which yields the outbound interface to which the Ethernet frame must
   be forwarded. Figure 2 below depicts the packet flow, where NVE1 and
   NVE2 are the ingress and egress NVEs, respectively.

   Note that the forwarding behavior on the egress NVE is similar to
   EVPN intra-subnet forwarding. In other words, all the packet
   processing associated with the inter-subnet forwarding semantics is
   confined to the ingress NVE.

   It should also be noted that [EVPN] provides different level of
   granularity for the EVI label.  Besides identifying bridge domain
   table, it can be used to identify the egress interface or a
   destination MAC address on that interface. If EVI label is used for
   egress interface or destination MAC address identification, then no
   MAC lookup is needed in the egress EVI and the packet can be directly
   forwarded to the egress interface just based on EVI label lookup.

   whereas the MAC address associated with the route is used to populate
   both the bridge-domain MAC table, as well as the adjacency associated
   with the IP route in the VRF. 

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated EVI. If the
   MAC address corresponds to its IRB Interface MAC address, the ingress
   NVE deduces that the packet MUST be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the
   ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the associated VRF table. The
   lookup identifies both the next-hop (i.e. egress) Gateway to which
   the packet must be forwarded, in addition to an adjacency that
   contains a MAC rewrite and an MPLS label stack. The MAC rewrite holds
   the MAC address associated with the destination host (as populated by
   the EVPN MAC route), instead of the MAC address of the next-hop
   Gateway. The ingress NVE then rewrites the destination MAC address in
   the packet with the address specified in the adjacency. It also
   rewrites the source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address.
   The ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to the next-hop (i.e.
   egress) Gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack.
   Note that this label stack includes the LSP label as well as an EVI
   label. The EVI label could be either advertised by the ingress
   Gateway, if inter-AS option B is used, or advertised by the egress
   NVE, if inter-AS option C is used. When the MPLS encapsulated packet
   is received by the ingress Gateway, the processing again differs
   depending on whether inter-AS option B or option C is employed: in
   the former case, the ingress Gateway swaps the EVI label in the
   packets with the EVI label value received from the egress Gateway. In
   the latter case, the ingress Gateway does not modify the EVI label
   and performs normal label switching on the LSP label. Similarly on
   the egress Gateway, for option B, the egress Gateway swaps the EVI
   label with the value advertised by the egress NVE. Whereas, for
   option C, the egress Gateway does not modify the EVI label, and
   performs normal label switching on the LSP label. When the MPLS
   encapsulated packet is received by the egress NVE, it uses the EVI
   label to identify the bridge-domain table. It then performs a MAC
   lookup in that table, which yields the outbound interface to which
   the Ethernet frame must be forwarded. Figure 3 below depicts the
   packet flow.

4.3 Among EVPN NVEs in Different DCs with Route Aggregation

   In this scenario, the NVEs within a given data center do not have
   entries for the MAC/IP addresses of hosts in remote data centers.
   Rather, the NVEs have a default IP route pointing to the WAN gateway
   for each VRF. This is accomplished by the WAN gateway advertising for
   a given EVPN that spans multiple DC a default VPN-IP route that is
   imported by the NVEs of that EVPN that are in the gateway's own DC.

   When an Ethernet frame is received by an ingress NVE, it performs a
   lookup on the destination MAC address in the associated EVI. If the
   MAC address corresponds to the IRB Interface MAC address, the ingress
   NVE deduces that the packet MUST be inter-subnet routed. Hence, the
   ingress NVE performs an IP lookup in the associated VRF table. The
   lookup, in this case, matches the default route which points to the
   local WAN gateway. The ingress NVE then rewrites the destination MAC
   address in the packet with the IRB Interface MAC address of the local
   WAN gateway. It also rewrites the source MAC address with its own IRB
   Interface MAC address. The ingress NVE, then, forwards the frame to
   the WAN gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack.
   Note that this label stack includes the LSP label as well as the IP-
   VPN label that was advertised by the local WAN gateway. When the MPLS
   encapsulated packet is received by the local WAN gateway, it uses the
   IP-VPN label to identify the VRF table. It then performs an IP lookup
   in that table. The lookup identifies both the remote WAN gateway (of
   the remote data center) to which the packet must be forwarded, in
   addition to an adjacency that contains a MAC rewrite and an MPLS
   label stack. The MAC rewrite holds the MAC address associated with
   the ultimate destination host (as populated by the EVPN MAC route).
   The local WAN gateway then rewrites the destination MAC address in
   the packet with the address specified in the adjacency. It also
   rewrites the source MAC address with its IRB Interface MAC address.
   The local WAN gateway, then, forwards the frame to the remote WAN
   gateway after encapsulating it with the MPLS label stack. Note that

   this label stack includes the LSP label as well as a VPN label that
   was advertised by the remote WAN gateway. When the MPLS encapsulated
   packet is received by the remote WAN gateway, it simply swaps the VPN
   label with the EVI label advertised by the egress NVE. This implies
   that the remote WAN gateway must allocate the VPN label at least at
   the granularity of a (VRF, egress NVE) tuple. The remote WAN gateway
   then forward the packet to the egress NVE. The egress NVE then
   performs a MAC lookup in the EVI (identified by the received EVI
   label) to determine the outbound port to send the traffic on.

   for each VRF.

   IP-VPN label to identify the VRF table. It then performs an IP lookup
   in that table. The lookup identifies the next hop ASBR to which the
   packet must be forwarded. The local gateway in this case strips the
   Ethernet encapsulation and forwards the IP packet to the ASBR using a
   label stack comprising of an LSP label and a VPN label that was
   advertised by the ASBR. When the MPLS encapsulated packet is received
   by the ASBR, it simply swaps the VPN label with the IP-VPN label
   advertised by the egress PE. This implies that the remote WAN gateway
   must allocate the VPN label at least at the granularity of a (VRF,
   egress PE) tuple. The ASBR then forwards the packet to the egress PE.
   The egress PE then performs an IP lookup in the VRF (identified by
   the received IP-VPN label) to determine where to forward the traffic.

4.5 Use of Centralized Gateway

   In this scenario, the NVEs within a given data center need to forward
   traffic in L2 to a centralized L3GW for a number of reasons: a) they
   don't have IRB capabilities or b) they don't have required policy for
   switching traffic between different tenants or security zones. The
   centralized L3GW performs both the IRB function for switching traffic
   among different EVPN instances as well as it performs interworking
   function when the traffic needs to be switched between IP-VPN sites
   and EVPN instances.

   addresses, or using the address aliasing as discussed in [DC-
   MOBILITY].

5.2 VM Mobility & Optimum Forwarding for VM's Inbound Traffic

   For optimum forwarding of the VM's inbound traffic, upon VM mobility,
   all the NVEs and/or IP-VPN PEs need to know the up to date location
   of the VM. Two scenarios must be considered, as discussed next.

   In what follows, we use the following terminology:

   - source NVE refers to the NVE behind which the VM used to reside
   prior to the VM mobility event.

   - target NVE refers to the new NVE behind which the VM has moved
   after the mobility event.

5.2.1 Mobility without Route Aggregation 

   In this scenario, when a target NVE detects that a MAC mobility event
   has occurred, it initiates the MAC mobility handshake in BGP as
   specified in [EVPN]. The WAN Gateways, acting as ASBRs in this case,
   re-advertise the MAC route of the target NVE with the MAC Mobility
   extended community attribute unmodified. Because the WAN Gateway for
   a given data center re-advertises BGP routes received from the WAN
   into the data center, the source NVE will receive the MAC
   Advertisement route of the target NVE (with the next hop attribute
   adjusted depending on which inter-AS option is employed). The source
   NVE will then withdraw its original MAC Advertisement route as a
   result of evaluating the Sequence Number field of the MAC Mobility
   extended community in the received MAC Advertisement route. This is
   per the procedures already defined in [EVPN].

5.2.2 Mobility with Route Aggregation
