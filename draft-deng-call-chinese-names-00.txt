1.  Background

   There were only two participants from mainland China in the IETF 60th
   meeting at San Diego, while today there are more than 150
   participants from mainland China each time.  But it seems that there
   are still many diffculties for western people to correctly call
   Chinese people's names.  This document is purposefully trying to make
   it easy for westerns.  It mainly discusses about "Han" people in
   mainland of China, and doesn't include other 55 minority group who
   speak their own languages.

2.  Way to call Chinese name in mainland

   In China, when we call somebody's name, we usually put his/her Last
   name first, and first name last.

   Most Last/Family names have only one Chinese character, and only a
   few consist of two characters.

   For first names, both one-character names and two-character names are
   common.

   So normally people names have two tp three Chinese characters (Today
   even for).  For those whose names have two characters, we normally
   speak out all the characters in their names.  For those whose names
   have more than two characters, we normally speak out their first name
   only, which is similar to western way.

   For example, Hui Deng, as an author of the draft, is a name of two
   characters, where we put his first name first "Hui", but when we call
   him, Chinese people usually call him Deng Hui (without titles in use,
   when titles are used, refer to the next section).

   Take 'Xiaodong Duan' as another example.  This is a name of three
   characters (Xiaodong as the first name and Duan is the family name).
   So Chinese people would usually neglect its last name, and just call
   him by using his first names - Xiaodong.

   People only call two characters probably because they prefer only two
   syllables other to three syllables, one chinese character normally
   has only one syllable.

   Getting back, when people are not familiar with each other or
   introduce each other Chinese people will use full name to show their
   respectation whatever two, three or four characters

3.  Titles in Use

   Most chinese people are called by different names according to the
   relationship between each other.  In other words, parents call their
   children by one name, his/her friends call him/her by something else,
   and colleagues have another name for him.  These different names
   include titles (terms of respect), nicenames, and so on.  Humble
   attitude is an authentic tradition in chinese culture, the
   respectation by using special terms is always given to the people
   according to his/her occupation or status in society.

   Nowadays, there are many commonly used titles.  Two generic titles
   that have similar meanings to "Mr." and "Ms./Mrs." are "Xian1sheng1"
   and "Nv3Shi4".  These two titles have been widely used either between
   peoples who are unfamiliar with each other, or during the formal
   situations like the conference.(1,2,3,4 in this section will be
   explained in next section)

   Another two commonly used titles are "Jiao4shao4" and "Lao3shi1"
   which indicate that people is a professor or instructor.  Suppose the
   surname of that professor or teacher is "Zhang", then you could him/
   her "Zhang Jiao4shou4" or "Zhang Lao3shi1".  Other titles which also
   have been widely used are as follows: "Lao3ban3" stands for the boss
   of the company, "Zhu3Xi2" stands for "chairman", "Zong" stands for
   "President of company", in most cases, you can add his surname in
   front of the title.  Rare cases, add his/her given name in front of
   the title.

   An unknown person such as taxi driver on the street can be called as
   "Shi1fu1".  The term means "Master", and it may means that he can
   help to bring you somewhere.

4.  The 'Four Tones'

Internet-Draft                Chinese-names                    July 2013


   This document has used four tones of Chinese (1: Even level; 2:
   Rising; 3: Departing; 4: Entering).  We usually denoted using the
   alphanumberic.  For example, Deng4 Hui1.

   Mandarin uses four tones to clarify the meanings of words.  Since
   many characters have the same sound, tones are used to differentiate
   words from each other.  Similar to the different intonations in
   English language.

   The tones sometimes are difficult to learn, as intonations and
   pitches in English to non-native speakers.  Normally people who speak
   Latin can only pronounce the 'Even level', because there are no
   equivalent differentiation in those language as we had guessed.

5.  Acknowledgement
