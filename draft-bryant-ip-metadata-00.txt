1.  Introduction

   This document defines the mechanism for carrying and identifying the
   presence of metadata carried in addition to the payload in IP
   packets.  The metadata header is common across all encapsulations
   (including IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS) and is defined in [I-D.guichard-
   metadata-header].  In this document ant reference to IP is to be
   taken as IPv4 and IPv6 unless otherwise specified.

2.  Metadata Component Structure

   The addition of metadata to packets enables the instrumentation of
   user packets, and service chaining, although it is anticipated that
   the ability to allow packets to carry data of use to the
   infrastructure and specific handling instructions will enable other
   uses.

   Metadata carried within an IP packet is carried in UDP and is
   prefaced by a Metadata Channel Header (MCH) as defined in [I-D
   .guichard-metadata-header].

   The presence of metadata is identified by the UDP port number
   assigned for this purpose.

   An IP packet carrying metadata consists of the original IP header
   (except for the IP protocol type), a UDP header, the MCH, the
   metadata and the original IP payload.  This is shown in Figure 1

   Metadata in IP Encapsulation

3.1.  The Metadata Insertion Process

   In this section we describe the process of inserting metadata into an
   existing IP packet.  This existing IP packet has been constructed in
   the normal way including the use of the normal protocol type or final
   next header type (IPv4 and Ipv6 respectively) to indicate the IP
   payload type, and the calculation of any transport layer checksums
   over the normal pseudoheader.

   The IP header, and in the case of IPv6, the next headers are removed
   from the packet and stored.  The metadata is prepended to the IP
   payload.  The MCH is prepended to the metadata.  The IPv4 protocol
   type or the final IPv6 next header is copied from the stored IP
   header into the protocol field of the MCH.

   The UDP header is prepended to the MCH.  The UDP destination port is
   set to the value "MCH-UDP" to indicate that an MCH follows.  The UDP
   source port is used for load balancing as described in Section 4.  As
   in this case UDP is providing an encapsulation for the IP payload,
   and the IP payload can be assumed to have been adequately protected
   before the inclusion of the metadata and encapsulation in UDP, the
   UDP checksum [RFC0768], [RFC6935] MAY therefore be safely set to
   zero, [RFC6936].

   The IP header is restored to the packet by prepending it to the UDP
   header.  The IPv4 protocol field or the IPv6 final next header is
   overwritten with the value 17 to indicate that a UDP header follows.

   The length of the IP packet is increased to compensate for the length
   of the UDP header, and the length of the metadata plus the metadata
   itself.

   The IP checksum is also incrementally corrected to compensate for
   these modifications.

   Any process functionally equivalent to the above is considered a
   compliant implementation.

   It goes without saying that a packet can be constructed ab initio
   with the metadata included.

   Fragmented IP packets are not supported.

3.2.  The Metadata Receive Process

   The receipt of a packet with a UDP port of type "MCH-UDP" indicates
   the presence of metadata.

   The MCH is examined and checked for the initial nibble of zero [I-D
   .guichard-metadata-header] and the MCH type is used to dispatch to
   the metadata process.  The processing of the metadata is MCH type
   specific and outside the scope of this document.

   If the MCH does not have an initial nibble of zero the packet is
   discarded and the configured management recording of the event
   undertaken (for example the event is counted).

3.3.  The Metadata removal Process

   In this section we describe the removal of the metadata and the
   reconstruction of the original IP packet.

   The protocol field in the MCH is stored.

   The IP header is prepended to the IP payload overwriting the MCH and
   the metadata.

   The protocol field in the IP header is overwritten by the protocol
   field extracted from the MCH.

   The length of the IP packet is decreased to compensate for the length
   of the UDP header, and the length of the metadata plus the metadata
   itself.

   The IP checksum is also incrementally corrected to compensate for
   these modifications.

Internet-Draft                 IP Metadata                     June 2013


   The reconstructed IP packet is processed as normal.

   Any process functionally equivalent to the above is considered a
   compliant implementation.

   It goes without saying that a packet does not need to be de-
   constructed by an application that is metadata aware.

4.  Load-balancing Considerations

   In an IPv4 packet with included metadata, the only field in the
   packet available to provide Equal Cost Multi-path (ECMP) Entropy is
   the UDP source port.

   The choice of which components of the original packet to extract
   entropy from and how calculate the entropy value stored in the UDP
   source port is implementation and protocol specific and is not
   specified in the document.  The following example of a method of
   calculating the source port is provided by way of example and is not
   normative.  The source port value MAY be calculated by hashing the IP
   source and destination addresses, the original IP protocol type (or
   final next header type in the case of IPv6) and, if applicable the
   source and destination ports of the original transport header and the
   result taken modulo 2^16.  As the MCH is a unidirectional channel a
   source port value of zero is allowed.

   Nothing in the above precludes the use of the IPv6 flow label to
   signal entropy to the routers on the network path, in which case the
   choice of UDP source port is outside the scope of this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that a UDP port is assigned to indicate the
   presence of metadata in the packet.  This value is referred to as
   "MCH-UDP" in this document.  The IANA specification of this UDP
   source port is:

   Service Name = NLmetadata

   Port Number = Next available from System Port Range.

   Transport Protocol = UDP (only)

   Description = Network Layer Metadata

   Assignee = IESG

   Contact = IETF Chair

6.  Security Considerations

   The addition of metadata to a packet increases the amount of
   processing required by the router receiving the packet, and thus may
   be a used in a denial of service attack vector.  Metadata SHOULD be
   blocked on ingress to the network other than from trusted sources.
   Metadata SHOULD only be processed when received from a trusted
   source.

   The metadata itself may be an attack vector with either the
   originating router or a man in the middle inserting malicious
   content, however the trust required from a router in the network is
   no different from the normal trust needed in this regard.

   Any management action taken to record the occurrence of a defective
   MCH or metadata payload SHOULD fall back to a lightweight process in
   the event of excessive events.  This minimises the use of defective
   metadata packets as an attack vector.

   If the ingress router is taking instructions from a third party in
   the specific metadata to insert, there MUST be a sufficient trust
   relationship between the ingress router and the third party.

   The security considerations associated with each metadata type MUST
   be specified as part of its definition.
