                    Requesting Suboptions in DHCPv6
                draft-mrugalski-dhc-dhcpv6-suboptions-03

Abstract

   DHCPv6 clients may use Option Request Option (ORO) defined in RFC3315
   [RFC3315] to specify, which options they would like to have
   configured by DHCPv6 servers.  Clients may also be interested in
   specific options that do not appear in DHCPv6 message directly (top-
   level options), but rather as nested options or sub-options (i.e.
   options conveyed within other options).  This document clarifies how
   to use already defined ORO to request specific options within scopes
   other than top-level and introduces new option that signals support
   for per-option ORO.  This document updates RFC3315.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft       Requesting Suboptions in DHCPv6          March 2012


1.  Introduction

   There are 2 ways a DHCPv6 client can inform a server about its intent
   to have an option configured.  The first (mandatory) way is to send
   Option Request Option (ORO), defined in [RFC3315].  The second way
   (optional, can be used as an addition to the first method) is to send
   the actual requested option to provide hints to a server.

   Clients may also be interested in receiving specific sub-options
   (i.e. options that do not appear in DHCPv6 messages directly, but
   rather within other options).  Unfortunately, there is no clear way
   for clients to request such sub-options.  [RFC3315] does not provide
   any guidance regarding such problem.  This document clarifies how
   clients should request sub-options.


2.  Terminology

   This section defines terms used in this document.

   Option - Any DHCPv6 Option, defined according to format specified in
   [RFC3315].  Option may appear in DHCPv6 message directly or within
   other options.

   Top-Level Option - an option that appears in DHCPv6 directly.  Most
   existing options are top-level options.

   Sub-Option - An option that appears not as top-level option, but
   rather within other option.  An example of such option is IAADDR that
   may only appear within IA_NA or IA_TA options.  Sub-options are
   sometimes referred to as nested options.

   Scope - Any place (message or option) that is allowed to convey
   DHCPv6 options.  Examples of scope are top-level (options conveyed
   directly within DHCPv6 message), IA_NA (options conveyed within
   specific instance of IA_NA option), or IA_PD (options conveyed within
   specific instance of IA_PD option).


3.  Suboption Request Procedure

   Clients that want specific sub-option provided by the server, MAY
   include ORO within requested scope.  However, many server
   implementations may not support it.  Therefore client SHOULD send
   SUBOPT_ORO option code in ORO, when sending its message.  If server
   is configured to support per-option ORO, it will return SUBOPT_ORO
   option.  Presence of this option indicates that server supports per-
   option ORO.  In such case client SHOULD include ORO in sent options

   to request specific suboptions.  For example, if client expects to
   have suboption FOO configured in IA_NA, it should transmit IA_NA
   option that contains ORO.  This ORO should convey a FOO option code
   and possibly other options requested within that scope.

   Client that did not receive SUBOPT_ORO assumes that server does not
   support per-option ORO and SHOULD NOT send ORO within other option
   and limit itself to sending ORO in top level, as specified in Section
   22.7 of [RFC3315].

   Client MAY include several instances of ORO, one for each scope.
   Client MUST NOT include more than one ORO in each scope.

   Client MUST include ORO in sent messages directly as specified in
   Section 22.7 of [RFC3315] to request top-level options.


4.  Suboption Option Request Option

   This option is returned by a server to inform client that it is able
   to process ORO within other options.  Server that supports per option
   ORO MUST send this option if requested by client and MAY send it,
   even when not requested.

   Clients SHOULD request this option to discover if server is able to
   process ORO sent within other options.

5.  Justification

   As DHCPv6 protocol evolves and continues to be used to configure
   increasingly complex features, number of nested options will
   increase.  To avoid each new document repeating the same sub-option
   request procedure, it seems reasonable to define such uniform
   procedure now.  Even worse, such documents may propose different ways

   of requesting different options.  This would considerably complicate
   server implementations.

   Another alternative possible approach would be to simply use ORO as
   it is already defined.  Client could include single instance of ORO
   to express desire to receive specific suboptions.  Several existing
   server implementations deal with all options in an uniform way.
   Using top-level ORO to request suboptions would possibly cause server
   to misplace requested options (i.e. to place them as top-level option
   rather than suboption).  Avoiding such pitfalls, would complicate
   server implementation, as servers would have to be configured with
   extra information regarding each option (where does specific option
   is supposed to appear - top level or as suboption).  For example, in
   case when client requested PD_EXCLUDE and DNS_SERVERS options, server
   would have to handle each requested option differently and put one
   option inside an IAPREFIX option, while the other option directly in
   a message.

   Using ORO as top-level option has the drawback of being global, i.e.
   affecting all options.  In certain situations, it may be useful to be
   able to limit option requests to certain instances of an option.  For
   example, requesting router that needs two prefixes may request
   PD_EXCLUDE only in first IA_PD option, but not in the second.  Such
   flexibility is not available when using only "classic" ORO.


6.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   A client that is interested in specific suboptions SHOULD request
   SUBOPT_ORO option, when sending ORO in its SOLICIT, REBIND or
   INFORMATION-REQUEST messages.  Client MAY request SUBOPT_ORO in other
   transmitted messages.

   If a client receives SUBOPT_ORO option, then sending server supports
   per-option ORO.  In such case, an addition to standard behavior
   defined in [RFC3315] client MAY include ORO in each option that it
   would like to receive suboptions in.  For example, if client wants to
   receive suboption FOO in IA_NA option, it SHOULD transmit IA_NA
   option that contains a single ORO with FOO option code.

   A client SHOULD NOT send ORO within other options, if the server
   didn't return SUBOPT_ORO option.


7.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Server processes the message received from client in a regular way,
   as explained in [RFC3315].  Server that supports per option ORO, MUST

Internet-Draft       Requesting Suboptions in DHCPv6          March 2012


   send SUBOPT_ORO option if requested by client and MAY send it, even
   when not requested.

   Server that supports this mechanism performs additional processing.
   For each option that is allowed to have suboptions (i.e. for each
   scope), server checks if there is ORO present.  For each ORO present,
   server appends requested options if it is configured to do so.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is kindly requested to allocate DHCPv6 option code TBD to the
   OPTION_SUBOPT_ORO.  This value should be added to the DHCPv6 option
   code space defined in Section 24.3 of [RFC3315].


9.  Security Considerations

   TBD
