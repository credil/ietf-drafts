This document specifies how signaling is conducted in the course of CLUE sessions.
This includes how SIP/SDP signaling is applied to CLUE sessions as well as defining 
a CLUE-specific signaling protocol that complements SIP/SDP and supports negotiation
of CLUE application level data.

   <section title="CLUE-Specific Signaling Protocol " anchor="sec.protocol">
      <t>
The <xref target="I-D.ietf-clue-framework">CLUE Framework</xref> mentions a CLUE-specific 
protocol for the exchange of ADVERTISEMENT and CONFIGURE messages, but gives little detail.
The <xref target="I-D.presta-clue-data-model-schema">Data Model</xref> specifies a model
and XML representation for CLUE-related data, but doesn't currently specify exactly what
data belongs in each message, or how messages are sequenced. 
This document provides the detail missing from those documents.
      </t>

         <section title="CLUE Messages" anchor="sec.messages">
            <t>
CLUE messages are encoded in XML.
The <xref target="I-D.presta-clue-data-model-schema">Data Model</xref>
defines many/most of the elements from which CLUE messages are composed.
The content of each individual CLUE message could be defined by reference to an
XML element type defined in the Data Model. 
Or this document could itself define an XML element type for each message,
with much of the content of those elements being drawn from the Data Model.
Which approach to follow is TBD.
            </t>

            <section title="ADVERTISEMENT Message">
               <t>
Most of the content needed for the ADVERTISEMENT message is already defined in the Data Model.
But the Data Model has't been constructed with that in mind. 
So either the Data Model needs revision with a focus on the needs of signaling,
or else additional schema is needed here.
               </t>
           </section>

            <section title="CONFIGURE Message">
               <t>
The CONFIGURE message should probably also be based primarily on data elements
defined in the Data Model.
               </t>
                <t>
The CONFIGURE message must make reference (explicitly or implicitly) 
to the ADVERTISEMENT message on which it is based. 
The mechanism for doing this must be specified.
               </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Stand-alone messages or deltas?">
               <t>

Each message exchanged within a CLUE session could contain a complete description
of the state it wishes to achieve. 
Or each message could describe just the changes that it wishes to make to the current state.
Or the protocol could support both message forms.
Which direction to pursue is TBD.

[Paul: while this does need to be decided, it is fundamentally just an optimization.
IMO it does not have major impact on the other parts of this document,
so I would prefer to continue deferring it until we are so far along with the
remainder of the document that we can no longer defer it.]

         <section title="Message Acknowledgement" anchor="sec.ack">

            <t>
The CLUE channel is reliable, so there is no need for acknowledgement to
guarantee delivery. But there is still a need for application-to-application acknowledgement
to report that the message has been received, parsed, and found to be of an acceptable format.
One possibility is to introduce separate ACK and/or NAK messages.
Another possibility is to add a confirmation element to each CLUE message, 
so that confirmation can be piggybacked on the basic messages.
Something concrete needs to be proposed.
            </t>

         </section>

         <section title="Message Sequencing" anchor="sec.sequencing">

            <t>
There is a very basic introduction to this topic in section 9.4 (Message Flow) of the
<xref target="I-D.ietf-clue-framework">CLUE Framework</xref>. 
That still mentions the Consumer Capability message, which we have decided to drop.
Without that it would look like:
            </t>

               <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[

               ]]></artwork>
            </figure>
            <t>

But we need much more than this, to show multiple CONFIGUREs per ADVERTISEMENT, 
interleaving of ADVERTISEMENTs and CONFIGUREs in both directions, etc.

            </t>

            <t>
Message sequencing needs to be described at two levels:
            </t>

            <list style='symbols'>
               <t>

Basic sequencing of the CLUE messages themselves, 
without regard for the SIP/SDP signaling that may be going on at the same time.
This is useful to cover the basic concepts. That should be covered in this section.
It provides context for understanding the more detailed treatment later.
<vspace blankLines='1'/>
This could include some simple state machines.
<vspace blankLines='1'/>

               </t>
               <t>

In reality there is a complex dependency between CLUE signaling and 
SDP Offer/Answer exchanges carried in SIP signaling.
So there is a need to describe the valid ways in which these
two forms of signaling interact. That is covered in
<xref target="sec.coordination"/>.

First, endpoint EP1 sends to endpoint EP2 a SIP INVITE including 
in the SDP body the basilar audio and video capabilities 
("BASIC SDP") and the information needed 
for opening a control channel to be used 
for CLUE protocol messages exchange, according to what is
 envisioned in the COMEDIA approach ("COMEDIA") 
 for DTLS/SCTP channel <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp"/>.  
</t>
  <t>
  After the successful SIP O/A phase, EP1 and EP2 are able to 
  exchange audio and video streams ("BASIC AUDIO AND VIDEO").
  [RP: Is this channel needed at this point of the call flow?]
  [RP: which streams are sent on this channel in this moment?]
  </t>
  
  <t>
  Moreover, another effect of the above successful SIP O/A phase,
  is the opening of the control
  channel. After the setup phase, the channel is
  established and CLUE protocol messages can flow above it.     
  </t>
  
  <t>
  CLUE protocol messages have not been formally defined yet.
  However, up to now there is a common agreement 
  on their names and their main purposes, that should be 
  following.
  </t>
  
  <t>
  CLUE protocol ADVERTISEMENT messages are used 
  to better describe the media provider's available streams 
  in order to make the media consumer able to reproduce them 
  in a more realistic fashion, as it is the
  main purpose of a telepresence session.
  These messages are needed since it is not possible in an 
  agile fashion to describe 
  spatial information and several further metadata 
  about media captures via SDP.
  </t>
  
  <t>
  In this document it is assumed that 
  ADVERTISEMENT messages contain the full description
  of the sender's telepresence room in terms of
  available media capture and encoding capabilities.
  [RP: open issue - the mapping between what is described
  in the advertisement messages and media streams 
  exchanged in the eventual basic SDP session already established]
  </t>
  
  <t>
  CLUE protocol CONFIGURE messages are used 
  to let the media consumer indicate to the 
  media provider which are the available streams
  it is interested in, so that the media provider
  can send to the media consumer what it desires.
  </t>
  
  <t>In the following, it is considered one of the 
  possible call flow that can lead to the desired 
  session configuration.
  </t>
  <t>
  EP1 sends the ADVERTISEMENT message to EP2 (ADVERTISEMENT 1), 
  which replies with a CONFIGURE message (CONFIGURE 1).
  After receiving the CONFIGURE message, EP1 assumes
  the CLUE offer/answer negotiation it started is completed.
  EP1 then can issue a REINVITE to EP2 with an SDP
  body updated accordingly to the CLUE messages exchange.  
  </t>
  <t>
   Similarly, EP2 sends its ADVERTISEMENT 
  to EP1 (ADVERTISEMENT 2), which replies with a 
  CONFIGURE (CONFIGURE 2). 
  </t>
  
<!--   <t>
  After both the CLUE Offer/Answer phase 
    both EP1 and EP2
  know the media streams desired in the teleprensence session.
  </t> -->
  <t>
   EP1  
  re-negotiates the media involved
  in the existent session via a SIP REINVITE message to EP2.
  The SDP body within the REINVITE message reflects 
  the negotiation carried on by the CLUE message exchange.
  In the case represented in figure, EP2 builds
  the 200 OK response also according to the second CLUE O/A
  negotiation.   
  </t>	  
  
  
</section>

<section title="A case with a non-CLUE-capable endpoint" 
anchor="sec-noncluecapable">

<t>
In this example, one of the two involved endpoint (EP2) 
is not CLUE-capable, i.e., it is not able to use the
CLUE protocol.

Endpoint EP1 sends to endpoint EP2 a SIP INVITE including 
in the SDP body the basilar audio and video capabilities 
("BASIC SDP") and the information needed 
for opening a control channel to be used 
for CLUE protocol messages exchange, as envisioned by the COMEDIA
approach ("COMEDIA") for DTLS/SCTP channel <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp"/>.  
</t>
<t>Since EP2 is not CLUE-capable, it answers with a 200 OK in which 
basic audio and video capabilities are accepted while the opening
of the CLUE channel is rejected.
</t>
<t>
From such a response, EP1 understands the peer is not
CLUE-capable. 
In this example, EP1 re-negotiates the session according
to a pre-determined bulk of media streams to be sent to non-CLUE-capable
endpoints.

         <section title="Message Transport" anchor="sec.transport">
            <t>

CLUE messages are transported over CLUE channels.  
In a two-party CLUE session, a CLUE channel connects the two endpoints.
In a CLUE conference, each endpoint has a CLUE channel connecting it to an MCU. 
(In conferences with cascaded mixers <xref target="RFC4353"/>, 
two MCUs will be connected by a CLUE channel.)

            </t>
            <t>

The transport mechanism used for CLUE messages is DTLS/SCTP as specified in 
<xref target="I-D.tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps"/> and 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp"/>. 
A CLUE channel consists of one SCTP stream in each direction over a DTLS/SCTP session.
The mechanism for establishing the DTLS/SCTP session is described in
<xref target="sec.sdp_oa"/>.

         <section title="Message Framing">

Message framing is provided by the SCTP transport protocol.
Each CLUE message is carried in one SCTP message.

   <section title="CLUE use of SDP O/A" anchor="sec.sdp_oa">

      <t>
The CLUE channel is usually offered in the first SIP O/A exchange between
two parties in an intended CLUE session. The offer of the CLUE channel
is the indicator that this SIP session is proposing to establish a CLUE session.
      </t>
      <t>
(However it is also acceptable to start with a non-CLUE SIP session and upgrade it
to a CLUE session later.)
      </t>
      <t>
The mechanism for negotiating a DTLS/SCTP connection is specified in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp"/>.
We need to specify how to select the specific pair of SCTP streams that comprise the CLUE channel.
      </t>

      <t>
Any specific usage/conventions required for coordination of SDP
offers and answers with the CLUE messages should also be described here.

<xref target="I-D.even-clue-sdp-clue-relation"/>

   <section title="Coordination of CLUE protocol and SDP O/A" anchor="sec.coordination">
      <t>
This should include state machines and/or call flows. These will illustrate, and then
provide normative rules for valid sequences of messages of both types.
For instance this needs to show when SDP offers and answers must occur relative to
an ADVERTISEMENT or CONFIGURE message that requires SDP changes.

This may just describe how the degenerate form of the general mechanisms
work for legacy devices. Or it may describe special case handling that we
mandate as part of CLUE. Or it may just discuss non-normative things for implementors
should consider.

   <section title="Open Issues">
      <t>

Here are issues pertinent to signaling that need resolution.
Resolution will probably result in changes somewhere in this document,
but may also impact other documents.

         <t>

While the preference is to multiplex multiple capture encodings over a single RTP session,
this will not always be desirable or possible. The factors that prevent multiplexing
may come from either the provider or the consumer. So the extent of multiplexing
must be negotiated. The decision about how to multiplex affects the number and
grouping of m-lines in the SDP. The endpoint of a CLUE session that sends an offer
needs to know the mapping of capture encodings to m-lines for both sides. 
<vspace blankLines='1'/>
AFAIK this issue hasn't yet been considered at all.
