                     More Raw Public Keys for IKEv2
                draft-kivinen-ipsecme-oob-pubkey-03.txt

Abstract

   The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol currently only
   supports raw RSA keys.  In some environments it is useful to make use
   of other types of public keys, such as those based on Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography.  This documents adds support for other types of raw
   public keys to IKEv2 and obsoletes the old raw RSA key format.

Internet-Draft       More Raw Public Keys for IKEv2        November 2012


1.  Introduction

   Secure DNS allows public keys to be associated with domain names for
   usage with security protocols like Internet Key Exchange Version 2
   (IKEv2) [RFC5996] and Transport Layer Security (TLS) but it relies on
   extensions in those protocols to be specified.

   IKEv2 already offers support for PKCS #1 encoded RSA keys, i.e., a
   DER- encoded RSAPublicKey structure (see [RSA] and [RFC3447]).  Other
   raw public keys types are, however, not supported.

   The TLS Out-of-Band Public Key Validation specification
   ([I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey]) adds generic support for raw public keys
   to TLS by re-using the SubjectPublicKeyInfo format from the X.509
   Public Key Infrastructure Certificate profile [RFC5280].

   This document is similar than the TLS Out-of-Band Public Key
   Validation specification, and applies the concept to IKEv2 to support
   all public key formats defined by PKIX.  This approach also allows
   future public key extensions to be supported without the need to
   introduce further enhancements to IKEv2.

   To support new types of public keys in IKEv2 the following changes
   are needed:

   o  A new Certificate Encoding format needs to be defined for carrying
      the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure.  Section 3 specifies this new
      encoding format.
   o  A new Certificate Encoding type needs to be allocated from the
      IANA registry.  Section 6 contains this request to IANA.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Certificate Encoding Payload

   Section 3.6 of RFC 5996 defines the Certificate payload format as
   shown in Figure 1.

                   Figure 1: Certificate Payload Format.

   o  Certificate Encoding (1 octet) - This field indicates the type of
      certificate or certificate-related information contained in the
      Certificate Data field.

      Certificate Encoding                 Value
      ----------------------------------------------------
      Raw Public Key                       TBD

   o  Certificate Data (variable length) - Actual encoding of the
      certificate data.  The type of certificate is indicated by the
      Certificate Encoding field.

   When the certificate encoding type 'Raw Public Key' is used then the
   Certificate Data only contains the SubjectPublicKeyInfo part of the
   PKIX certificate.

   In the case of the Certificate Request payload the Certification
   Authority field MUST be empty if the "Raw Public Key" certificate
   encoding is used.


4.  Old Raw RSA Key Certificate Type

   After this there would be two ways of sending Raw RSA public keys in
   the IKEv2: The original IKEv2 mechanism (Raw RSA Key, encoding value
   11), and the new format defined here.  The old Raw RSA Key encoding
   has not been widely used.  The IKEv2 protocol already supports a
   method to indicate what certificate encoding formats are supported,
   i.e. a peer can send one or multiple Certificate Request payload with
   the certificate encoding types it supports.  From this list the
   recipient can see what formats are supported and select one which is
   used to send Certificate back.

   Implementations conforming to this document MUST use the new format
   defined here for the raw public keys, regardless of the key type.

Internet-Draft       More Raw Public Keys for IKEv2        November 2012


   This means that old Raw RSA Key encoding value 11 MUST NOT be used
   for certificate or certificate request payloads.

   Note, that recipients can simply process the old Raw RSA key
   encodings just like any other unsupported or unknown certificate
   encoding type, i.e. skip over it, recipients MUST NOT consider
   receiving such payloads as fatal error (if other end sends such
   payloads, it is completely possible that the peers do not have common
   format for certificate encoding and the authentication will fail
   because of that).


5.  Security Considerations

   An IKEv2 deployment using raw public keys needs to utilize an out-of-
   band public key validation procedure to be confident in the
   authenticity of the keys being used.  One such mechanism is to use a
   configuration mechanism for provisioning raw public keys into the
   IKEv2 software.  A suitable deployment is likely to be found with
   smart objects.  Yet another approach is to rely on secure DNS to
   associate public keys to be associated with domain names using the
   IPSECKEY DNS RRtype [RFC4025].  More information can be found in DNS-
   Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) [RFC6394].

   This document does not change the assumptions made by the IKEv2
   specifications since "Raw RSA Key" support is already available in
   IKEv2.  This document only generalizes the raw public key support and
   obsoletes the old "Raw RSA Key" format.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document allocates a new value from the IKEv2 Certificate
   Encodings registry:

   TBD      Raw Public Key

   This document also obsoletes the old value in the same registry, and
   the entry for "Raw RSA Key" should be changed to:

   11       Obsoleted (was Raw RSA Key)

Appendix A.  Examples

   This appendix provides examples of the actual packets sent on the
   wire.  This uses the 256-bit ECDSA private/public key pair defined in
   the section 8.1. of the IKEv2 ECDSA document [RFC4754].

   The public key is as followed:

   o  Algorithm : id-ecPublicKey (1.2.840.10045.2.1)
   o  Fixed curve: secp256r1 (1.2.840.10045.3.1.7)
   o  Public key x coordinate : cb28e099 9b9c7715 fd0a80d8 e47a7707
      9716cbbf 917dd72e 97566ea1 c066957c
   o  Public key y coordinate : 2b57c023 5fb74897 68d058ff 4911c20f
      dbe71e36 99d91339 afbb903e e17255dc

   The SubjectPublicKeyInfo ASN.1 object is as follows:

   0000 :     SEQUENCE
   0002 :       SEQUENCE
   0004 :         OBJECT IDENTIFIER  id-ecPublicKey (1.2.840.10045.2.1)
   000d :         OBJECT IDENTIFIER  secp256r1 (1.2.840.10045.3.1.7)
   0017 :       BIT STRING  (66 bytes)
   00000000: 0004 cb28 e099 9b9c 7715 fd0a 80d8 e47a
   00000010: 7707 9716 cbbf 917d d72e 9756 6ea1 c066
   00000020: 957c 2b57 c023 5fb7 4897 68d0 58ff 4911
   00000030: c20f dbe7 1e36 99d9 1339 afbb 903e e172
   00000040: 55dc

   The first byte (00) of the bit string indicates that there is no
   "number of unused bits", and the second byte (04) indicates
   uncompressed form ([RFC5480]).  Those two octets are followed by the
   values of X and Y.

   The final encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo object is as follows:

   00000000: 3059 3013 0607 2a86 48ce 3d02 0106 082a
   00000010: 8648 ce3d 0301 0703 4200 04cb 28e0 999b
   00000020: 9c77 15fd 0a80 d8e4 7a77 0797 16cb bf91
   00000030: 7dd7 2e97 566e a1c0 6695 7c2b 57c0 235f
   00000040: b748 9768 d058 ff49 11c2 0fdb e71e 3699
   00000050: d913 39af bb90 3ee1 7255 dc

   This will result the final IKEv2 Certificate Payload to be:
