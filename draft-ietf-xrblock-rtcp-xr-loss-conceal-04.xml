    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines two RTCP XR Report Blocks that allows the
      reporting of loss concealment metrics for audio applications of RTP.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <section title="Loss Concealment and Concealment Seconds Metrics Reporting Block">
        <t>At any instant, the audio output at a receiver may be classified as
        either 'normal' or 'concealed'. 'Normal' refers to playout of audio
        payload received from the remote end, and also includes locally
        generated signals such as announcements, tones and comfort noise.
        Concealment refers to playout of locally-generated signals used to
        mask the impact of network impairments or to reduce the audibility of
        jitter buffer adaptations.</t>

        <t>This draft defines two new concealment related block types to
        augment those defined in [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP
        applications.</t>

        <t>The first block type provides metrics for actions taken by the
        receiver to mitigate the effect of packet loss and packet discard.
        Specifically, the first metric (On-Time Playout Duration) reports the
        duration of normal playout of data which the receiver obtained from
        the sender's stream. A second metric (Loss Concealment Duration)
        reports the total time during which the receiver played out media data
        which was manufactured locally, because the sender's data for these
        periods was not available due to packet loss or discard. A similar
        metric (Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration) reports the duration
        of playout of locally-manufactured data replacing data which is
        unavailable due to adaptation of an adaptive de-jitter buffer. Further
        metrics (Playout Interrupt Count and Mean Playout Interrupt Size)
        report the number of times normal playout was interrupted, and the
        mean duration of these interruptions.</t>

        <t>Loss Concealment Duration and Buffer Adjustment Concealment
        Duration are reported separately because buffer adjustment is
        typically arranged to occur in silence periods so may have very little
        impact on user experience, whilst loss concealment may occur at any
        time.</t>

        <t>The second block type provides metrics for concealment.
        Specifically, the first metric (Unimpaired Seconds) reports the number
        of whole seconds occupied only with normal playout of data which the
        receiver obtained from the sender's stream. The second metric
        (Concealed Seconds) reports the number of whole seconds during which
        the receiver played out any locally-generated media data. A third
        metric (Severely Concealed Seconds) reports the number of whole
        seconds during which the receiver played out locally-generated data
        for more than SCS Threshold (ms).</t>

        <t>These metrics belongs to the class of transport-related terminal
        metrics defined in <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defined an
        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This draft defines a new Extended Report block that MUST be used as
        defined in <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Architectures <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref> provides guideline for reporting block format
        using RTCP XR. The Metrics Block described in this document are in
        accordance with those guidelines.</t>

            following code: <list>
                <t>bits 014-015<list>
                    <t>0 = silence insertion</t>

              </list><vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Reserved (resv): 4 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />These bits are reserved. They MUST be set to zero
            by senders and ignored by receivers (See <xref
            target="RFC6709"></xref> section 4.2). <vspace

            <t hangText="block length: 16 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" /> The
            length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one. For the
            Loss Concealment block, the block length is equal to 5.<vspace

            <t hangText="SSRC of source: 32 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />As
            defined in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.<vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="On-time Playout Duration (ms): 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />'On-time' playout is the uninterrupted,
            in-sequence playout of valid decoded audio information originating
            from the remote endpoint. This includes comfort noise during
            periods of remote talker silence, if VAD is used, and locally
            generated or regenerated tones and announcements. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />An equivalent definition is that on-time playout
            is playout of any signal other than those used for concealment.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />On-time playout duration MUST include
            both speech and silence intervals, whether VAD is used or not.
            This duration is reported in millisecond units.</t>

            <t>If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
            MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the
            measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Loss Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout
            corresponding to Loss-type concealment. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Loss-type concealment is reactive insertion or
            deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to effective
            frame loss at the audio decoder. "Effective frame loss" is the
            event in which a frame of coded audio is simply not present at the
            audio decoder when required. In this case, substitute audio
            samples are generally formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to
            reduce audible impairment. <vspace blankLines="1" />If the
            measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE MUST be
            reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the measurement
            is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported. <vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t
            hangText="Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout
            corresponding to Buffer Adjustment-type concealment, if known.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD,
            the value 0xFFFFFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-range
            measurement. If the measurement is unavailable, the value
            0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported. <vspace blankLines="1" />Buffer
            Adjustment-type concealment is proactive or controlled insertion
            or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to jitter
            buffer adaptation, re-sizing or re-centering decisions within the
            endpoint. <vspace blankLines="1" />Because this insertion is
            controlled, rather than occurring randomly in response to losses,
            it is typically less audible than loss-type concealment. For
            example, jitter buffer adaptation events may be constrained to
            occur during periods of talker silence, in which case only silence
            duration is affected, or sophisticated time-stretching methods for
            insertion/deletion during favorable periods in active speech may
            be employed. <vspace blankLines="1" />Concealment events which
            cannot be classified as Buffer Adjustment- type MUST be classified
            as Loss-type. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Playout Interrupt Count: 16 bits"><vspace

            which occurred during the reporting period. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
            0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If
            the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Mean Playout Interrupt Size (ms): 16 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The mean duration, in ms, of interruptions to
            normal playout which occurred during the reporting period. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
            0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If

    <section title="Concealment Seconds Block">
      <t>This sub-block provides a description of potentially audible
      impairments due to lost and discarded packets at the endpoint, expressed
      on a time basis analogous to a traditional PSTN T1/E1 errored seconds
      metric.</t>

      <t>The following metrics are based on successive one second intervals as
      declared by a local clock. This local clock does NOT need to be
      synchronized to any external time reference. The starting time of this
      clock is unspecified. Note that this implies that the same loss pattern
      could result in slightly different count values, depending on where the
      losses occur relative to the particular one-second demarcation points.
      For example, two loss events occurring 50ms apart could result in either
      one concealed second or two, depending on the particular 1000 ms
      boundaries used.</t>

      <t>The seconds in this sub-block are not necessarily calendar seconds.
      At the tail end of a session, periods of time of less than 1000ms shall
      be incorporated into these counts if they exceed 500ms and shall be
      disregarded if they are less than 500ms.</t>

            defined as a continuous period of 1000ms during which any frame
            loss or discard due to late arrival has occurred. <vspace
            blankLines="1" /> Equivalently, a concealed second is one in which
            some Loss-type concealment has occurred. Buffer adjustment-type
            concealment SHALL not cause Concealed Seconds to be incremented,
            with the following exception. An implementation MAY cause
            Concealed Seconds to be incremented for 'emergency' buffer
            adjustments made during talkspurts. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Loss-type concealment is reactive insertion or
            deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to effective
            frame loss at the audio decoder. "Effective frame loss" is the
            event in which a frame of coded audio is simply not present at the
            audio decoder when required. In this case, substitute audio
            samples are generally formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to
            reduce audible impairment. <vspace blankLines="1" />Buffer
            Adjustment-type concealment is proactive or controlled insertion
            or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to jitter
            buffer adaptation, re-sizing or re-centering decisions within the
            endpoint. <vspace blankLines="1" />Because this insertion is
            controlled, rather than occurring randomly in response to losses,
            it is typically less audible than loss-type concealment. For
            example, jitter buffer adaptation events may be constrained to
            occur during periods of talker silence, in which case only silence
            duration is affected, or sophisticated time-stretching methods for
            insertion/deletion during favorable periods in active speech may
            be employed. For these reasons, buffer adjustment-type concealment
            MAY be exempted from inclusion in calculations of Concealed
            Seconds and Severely Concealed Seconds. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />However, an implementation SHOULD include
            buffer-type concealment in counts of Concealed Seconds and
            Severely Concealed Seconds if the event occurs at an 'inopportune'
            moment, with an emergency or large, immediate adaptation during
            active speech, or for unsophisticated adaptation during speech
            without regard for the underlying signal, in which cases the
            assumption of low-audibility cannot hold. In other words, jitter
            buffer adaptation events which may be presumed to be audible
            SHOULD be included in Concealed Seconds and Severely Concealed
            Seconds counts.</t>

            <t>Concealment events which cannot be classified as Buffer
            Adjustment- type MUST be classified as Loss-type.</t>

            <t>For clarification, the count of Concealed Seconds MUST include
            the count of Severely Concealed Seconds.</t>

            <t>If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
            MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the
            measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be
            reported.</t>

            <t hangText="Severely Concealed Seconds: 16 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A count of the number of Severely Concealed
            Seconds.<vspace blankLines="1" />A Severely Concealed Second is
            defined as a non-overlapping period of 1000 ms during which the
            cumulative amount of time that has been subject to frame loss or
            discard due to late arrival, exceeds the SCS Threshold. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
            0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If
            the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

            <t hangText="SCS Threshold: 8 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />The
            SCS Threshold defines the amount of time corresponding to lost or
            discarded frames that must occur within a one second period in
            order for the second to be classified as a Severely Concealed
            Second. This is expressed in milliseconds and hence can represent
            a range of 0.1 to 25.5 percent loss or discard. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />A default threshold of 50ms (5% effective frame

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
