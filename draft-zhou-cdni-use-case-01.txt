Abstract

   Industry needs the CDN interconnection to provide the CDN service
   that may cover a wider geographical area and a better service
   quality.  In the real pragmatic operation, the relationship between
   two CDNs should concern many factors(for instance, CDN or CP may
   select the downstream CDN based on some principals or conditions or
   service authorizations), hence the CDN interconnection is defacto a
   sort of constrained interconnection.  This document will give the use
   cases to indicate the models of how the CDN interconnection may be
   used and the associated examples for the use cases will be listed
   subsequently.

Internet-Draft                CDNI use case                     Aug 2011


1.  Introduction

   [I- D.bertrand-cdni-use-cases] has provided some basic use cases for
   CDN Interconnection.  While it has not talked about how CDN-A may
   interconnect CDN-B as its downstream CDN(e.g.  How the downstream CDN
   is selected; what operation rule(business rule) should be taken into
   account on service of CDN interconnection).

   This draft gives some use cases concerning the operation of multiple
   CDN federation and as a result some examples are provides.


2.  Terminology

   Roughly, this document may refer the terminology defined in section
   1.1 of [I-D.jenkins-cdni-problem-statement] and [I-D.bertrand-cdni-
   use-cases].


3.  Architecture for CDN-I Service

   Following, a general service architecture of CDN interconnection is
   listed as Figure 1:

   +-------+       +-------+      +-------+      +-------+
   |  CSP  |-------| CDN-A |------| CDN-B |------|  UE   |
   +-------+   |   +-------+      +-------+      +-------+
               |       \______________/              |
               |       /              \              |
               |   +-------+      +-------+          |
               |___| CDN-C |______| CDN-D |__________|
                   +-------+      +-------+

    Figure 1. Typical Architecture for CDN interconnection

   This is just a typical architecture of CDN interconnection.  The CSP
   may connect multiple CDNs and a upstream CDN may connect multiple
   downstream CDNs(such as CDN-A may connect either CDN-B or CDN-D;
   similarly to CDN-C)

   This figure is used for the following discussion of use cases while
   in reality it may be possible that the CSP only select one delegate
   CDN or a upstream CDN may only have one downstream CDN.


4.  Operating Requirements on CDN Interconnection

   In the real operation, some basic requirements of CDN-I service based



ZP.Zhou                 Expires February 18, 2012               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                CDNI use case                     Aug 2011


   on service operating should be abided, including:

   Authorization area for CDN provider: the CDN provider may only
   provide CDN service in a specific area, such as CDN-A may only serve
   in Beijing and CDN-B may only serve in Shanghai.  Such authorization
   may be determined by CSP or by upstream CDN for the downstream CDN.
   And such authorization is because of the business model(for example
   to protect the business of authorized CDN service provider).
   Therefore the associated policy should be supported in the CDN
   interconnection.

   Constraint of service by content: the access area or access period of
   specific content may be constrained in content service.  For example
   the movie in a Chinese video website may only be accessed by the
   terminals located in China mainland and if being overseas the request
   for the movie service will be rejected.  The rule in this use case
   comes from the content rights operation and should be conducted by
   the CDN service provider.

   Content adaptation: the format of content service may be converted
   according to the terminal's capability or consumer's application.
   For example, convert multicast (or unicast) RTP streams to HTTP
   streaming and then deliver the adaptive stream to terminals( refer to
   MCD CDN-I use case and requirement).  As for implementation of CDN
   service, it is optimum maintaining and delivering one format of
   content within CDN system(including CDN to CDN) while providing the
   adaptive streaming service on the interface between CDN and
   terminals.  The content adaptation may be deployed on a node of the
   CDN or CDN-I system as a functionality.

   Content priority: towards the content service, one way to provide the
   differ-service of content delivery is to set priority for the
   content.  Such priority mechanism may be supported and extended
   between CDNs.  The downstream CDN may inherit the content priority
   from CSP or upstream CDN or the priority may even be updated at the
   downstream CDN depending on the service.

   Totally the requirements above are usual rules of content service
   operating and are also applicable for CDN-I use cases.


5.  Use Cases

   In this section, three Use Cases to realize the requirements are
   described along with examples.

5.1.  CDN authorization

   In this use case, the CP may make a list of pairs of CDN and its
   authorized service area.  For example:
          _____________________________
         | CDN Provider | Service Area |
         |______________|______________|
         | CDN-A        |   Beijing    |
         |______________|______________|
         | CDN-B        |   Shanghai   |
         |______________|______________|
         | CDN-C        |   Guangdong  |
         |______________|______________|
         | ....         |    ....      |
         |______________|______________|
         | CDN-Z        |   Tianjing   |
         |______________|______________|
         | CDN-HK       |   Hongkong   |
         |______________|______________|

   Figure 2: Example List of CDN Authorization Areas

   The list of CDN authorization areas may be created by the CP and be
   kept by all CDNs.  When delivering content, CDN may refer to this
   list to determine with which CDN it has to connect.  Here gives two
   sub-cases:

   Sub-Case one: for the unicast service, when the CP receives a content
   request from a UE located in Beijing, CP will redirect that request
   to CDN-A.  CDN-A then will check whether the requested content is
   available locally.  If yes, then provide the content to the
   requesting UE, else if the content at that time is only stored in
   Tianjing and Guangdong, CDN-A will contact CDN-Z or CDN-C getting
   that content and at last issue that content to the UE.

   Sub-Case two: for the broadcast service, the content broadcast route
   may be designed based on the geographical relationship of each area.
   For example Tianjing is very near to Beijing.  If the CP is also
   located in Beijing, for the content broadcast, the content may be
   delivered from CP to CDN-A first and CDN-A will then forward the
   content to CDN-Z.  In the same way, the content to CDN-HK may be
   forwarded from CDN-C since Hongkong is near to Guangdong.  To design
   such transport route should consider the transport efficiency,
   neither overlap nor neglect an area.

   Further, if concern there are possibly multiple CDNs in an area, for
   example CDN-Ax and CDN-Ay both serve in Beijing, there should be an
   entity coordinating these two CDNs(CDN-Ax and CDN-Ay) and contacting

Internet-Draft                CDNI use case                     Aug 2011


   other CDNs outside of Beijing.  Or probably each CDN in the same area
   is responsible for different services, e.g.  CDN-Ax serves for Mobile
   request and CDN-Bx serves for request of IPTV service.

   The arrangement above may be seen as a typical deployment policy( may
   be beneficial for both efficiency and business cooperation).  The
   core issue is to keep all CDNs complying with the same policy.

5.2.  Constraint for Content

   The arrangement of content publishing/content service is another
   typical policy controlled by CP.  For example, the rights of
   OlympicGame in 2008 for live broadcast in China Mainland was
   purchased by CCTV and all related content may only be accessed in
   China Mainland.  Hereby a terminal from outside Mainland of China
   such as Hongkong is prohibited to access the live Olympic broadcast
   or video on demand issued from CCTV during Olympic period(Hongkong
   users may access Olympic content from another content provider
   locally in Hongkong).  Hence for all the CDNs within China during
   Olympic period, the content forward should abide this constriction.
   If broadcast both Movie-A and OlympicGame B, CDN-C should deliver
   content of Movie-A to CDN-HK but should not deliver content of
   OlympicGame B to CDN-HK.
          ________________________________________________
         | Content Name | Service Area | Service Period   |
         |______________|______________|__________________|
         | Movie-A      |    China     | 2009.01--2009.12 |
         |______________|______________|__________________|
         |OlympicGame B |China Mainland| 2008.08--2008.10 |
         |______________|______________|__________________|

         Figure 3: Example List of Constraint for Content

   When the service period expires, the CDNs should remove the related
   content.

   This constraint in fact has controlled the broadcast service as a
   limited broadcast.  This is another typical use case of broadcast or
   multicast over CDN interconnection.

5.3.  Content Adaptation

   To support the diversity of terminals and the fluctuant network band
   width, adaptation measures may be conducted for the content services.
   While for the CDN operator, it is better only to maintain
   minimum(only one) content format(s).  So, one solution is to
   transform the content format prior to delivery.  It means the content
   forwarded between CDNs may be RTP streams of best quality( e.g.  HD



ZP.Zhou                 Expires February 18, 2012               [Page 6]

   video and Hi-Fi audio) while the RTP stream may be transformed to
   adaptive streaming to serve for user.  One possible realization is
   that the delivering CDN which is nearest to the UE performs such
   delivery format adaptation according to the UE's capabilities.  The
   adaptation may include, but is not limited to, conversion to adaptive
   streaming, the transport format conversion, codec type conversion,
   content encapsulation conversion and content metadata conversion
   (e.g. content description, program information, etc).  For example,
   content is delivered from Content Provider through CDN-A to CDN-B in
   the form of normal RTP streams.  The delivering CDN, i.e.  CDN-B,
   determines that a UE requires the content to be delivered using
   adaptive HTTP streaming, CDN-B now transforms the RTP streams to an
   adaptive HTTP stream that can be delivered to the UE.  See as figure
   4:

+-------+ RTP Streams +-------+ RTP Streams +-------+
|  CSP  |------------>| CDN-A |------------>| CDN-B |
+-------+             +-------+             +-------+
                                               |Converted to
                                               |HTTP Streaming
                                               |               +-------+
                                                -------------->|  UE   |
                                                               +-------+

        Figure 4.  Example of Content Adaptation

   This use case is applicable for either broadcast or unicast service;
   for either live Broadcast or VOD service.  The content may be
   transformed and stored as different files with different formats/
   rates.  According to the UE capability(media resolution, media types,
   bandwidth, etc), the content request will be forwarded to specific
   content link of different content files/live broadcast sources.

5.4.  Content Priority

   For the differ-service of content delivery, one way is to set
   priority for the content.  For example the content for more users may
   be set a high priority and will be served first.

   For example, when CDN-A receives two tasks to deliver two contents to
   its downstream CDNs, CDN-A will check the priority of these two
   contents.  Since content-A is a live broadcast of football game to
   millions of audiences and has been set a very high priority, CDN-A
   will handle the task of content-A with high priority.

   In general, the content should be set a priority before it is
   delivered.  The content priority may be set by CSP, Upstream CDN or
   the UE( the user) and the priority may be set whether it may be



ZP.Zhou                 Expires February 18, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                CDNI use case                     Aug 2011


   updated or not in terms of service implementation.  For instance, the
   user may set his subscribed content with a high priority with high
   price and may change the priority sometimes, but the user may not set
   the priority of some contents such as the advertisement content.

   With the content priority, the CDN may also provide a VAS for the
   user.  If the user has subscribed two contents and when there is a
   time conflict of these two content services, CDN will automatically
   deliver the content service with high priority to the UE.  One
   example is, the user has subscribed two broadcast content services:
   the News program from 6 to 10 o'clock and a football game from 7
   o'clock but the football game is set a higher priority.  At 6
   o'clock, the CDN starts to deliver News content to UE and when time
   arrives at 7 o'clock, the CDN will automatically stop the News
   content delivery but start to deliver the content of football game.
   Accordingly, the UE will alter to play the football game from the
   News.  When the football game finishes at 10 after 9 o'clock, the CDN
   will automatically deliver again the News to the UE.

   This use case is applicable for either broadcast or unicast service;
   for either live Broadcast or VOD service.  The core requirement is
   the mechanism of priority management(e.g. set, exchange, update).


6.  Application Example

   Execution steps for this procedure may be as following:

   step 1: CSP informs to broadcast the content.

   step 2: CDNCF in CDN-A informs its clusters to receive/get the
   content( sports game with HD video format).

   step 3: Cluster in CDN-A receives/gets the content from CSP.

   step 4: CDNCF in CDN-A informs another CDNCF in CDN-Z to receive/get
   the content from the cluster in CDN-A.

   step 5: CDNCF in CDN-Z informs its clusters to receive/get the
   content from CDN-A.

   step 6: cluster in CDN-Z receives/gets the content from cluster in
   CDN-A.

   step 7: A UE in Tianjing subscribes the broadcast service.  Through a
   general CDN procedure, the UE is informed the address of cluster
   under CDN-Z where UE may receive the broadcast content.
   Additionally, CDN-Z may provide HTTP adaptive streaming and the
   content received from CDN-A is transformed in adaptive streaming for
   the UE.

   step 8: UE receives the broadcast service from CDN-Z.


7.  Security Considerations

   The involved service information should be guaranteed unchanged.
