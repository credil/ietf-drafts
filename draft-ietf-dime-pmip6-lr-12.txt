        Diameter Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6 Localized Routing
                      draft-ietf-dime-pmip6-lr-12

Abstract

   In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
   tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term
   "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
   directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node
   (CN) without involving any LMA.  In order to establish a localized
   routing session between two Mobile Access Gateways in a Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 domain, the usage of localized routing may be authorized for
   both MAGs.  This document specifies how to accomplish this using the
   Diameter protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] allows the Mobility Access
   Gateway to optimize media delivery by locally routing packets from a
   Mobile Node to a Correspondent Node that is locally attached to an
   access link connected to the same Mobile Access Gateway, avoiding
   tunneling them to the Mobile Node's Local Mobility Anchor.  This is
   referred to as "local routing" in RFC 5213.  However, this mechanism
   is not applicable to the typical scenarios in which the MN and CN are
   connected to different MAGs and are registered to the same LMA or
   different LMAs.  [RFC6279] defines the problem statement for PMIPv6
   localized routing.  [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr] describes a solution
   for PMIPv6 localized routing based on the scenarios defined in
   [RFC6279].  In these scenarios the information needed to set up a
   localized routing path (e.g., the addresses of the Mobile Access
   Gateways to which the MN and CN are respectively attached) is
   distributed between their respective Local Mobility Anchors.  This
   may complicate the setup and maintenance of localized routing.

   Therefore, in order to establish a localized routing path between the
   two Mobile Access Gateways, the Mobile Node's MAG must identify the
   LMA that is managing the Correspondent Node's traffic and then obtain
   the address of the Correspondent Node's MAG from that LMA.  In Proxy
   Mobile IPv6, the LMA to be assigned to the CN may be maintained as a
   configured entry in the Correspondent Node's policy profile located
   on an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server.
   However, there is no relevant work discussing how AAA-based
   mechanisms can be used to provide authorization to the Mobile Node's
   MAG or LMA for enabling localized routing.

   This document describes Diameter [I-D.ietf-dime-rfc3588bis] support
   for the authorization of PMIPv6 mobility entities during localized
   routing.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Solution Overview

   This document addresses how to provide authorization to the Mobile
   Node's MAG or LMA for enabling localized routing and resolve the
   destination MN's MAG by means of interaction between the LMA and the
   AAA server.  Figure 1 shows the reference architecture for Localized

   Routing Service Authorization.  This reference architecture assumes
   that

   o  MN1 and MN2 belong to the same LMA or different LMAs.  If MN1 and
      MN2 belong to the same LMA, LMA1 and LMA2 to which MN1 and MN2 are
      anchored in Figure 1 should be the same LMA.  If MN1 and MN2
      belong to different LMAs, LMA1 and LMA2 in Figure 1 are in the
      same provider domain (as described in [RFC6279]).

   o  The MAG and LMA support Diameter client functionality.

4.  Attribute Value Pair Definitions

   This section describes Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs) defined by this
   specification or re-used from existing specifications in a PMIPv6-
   specific way.

4.1.  MIP6-Agent-Info AVP

   The MIP6-Agent-Info grouped AVP (AVP Code 486) is defined in
   [RFC5447] and extended in [RFC5779].  This AVP with the M bit cleared
   is used to carry LMA addressing in the AA-Answer (AAA) message
   [I-D.ietf-dime-rfc4005bis].

4.2.  PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP

   The PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP (AVP Code 505) is defined in
   [RFC5779].  This AVP is used to carry the IPv4-MN-HoA (Mobile Node's
   IPv4 home address)[RFC5844] in the AA-Request (AAR) message
   [I-D.ietf-dime-rfc4005bis] from the LMA to the home AAA server
   (HAAA).

4.3.  MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP

   The MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP (AVP Code 125) is defined in [RFC5779].
   This AVP is used to carry the MN-HNP (Mobile Node's home network
   prefix) in the AAR from the LMA to the HAAA.

4.4.  MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP

   The MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP is defined in [RFC5447].  This document
   allocates a new capability flag bit according to the IANA rules in
   RFC 5447.

   INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED (TBD)

      Direct routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to different
      MAGs without involving any LMA is supported.  This bit is used
      with MN-HNP or IPv4-MN-HoA.  When a LMA sets this bit in the MIP6-
      Feature-Vector and MN-HNP or IPv4-MN-HoA corresponding to the
      Correspondent Node is carried with this bit, it indicates to the
      HAAA that the Mobile Node associated with this LMA is allowed to
      use localized routing but the LMA or MAG needs to know from the
      HAAA if the Correspondent Node is allowed to use localized
      routing.  If the MN-HNPs or IPv4-MN-HoAs corresponding to both the
      Mobile Node and the Correspondent Node are carried with this bit,
      it indicates that both the MN and CN are allowed to use localized
      routing.  Note that localized routing related signaling is
      required prior to localized routing.  If this bit is cleared in

      the returned MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP, the HAAA does not authorize
      direct routing of packets between MNs anchored to the different
      MAG.  The LMA MUST support this policy feature on a per-MN and
      per-subscription basis.


5.  Example Signaling Flows for Localized Routing Service Authorization

   Localized Routing Service Authorization can happen during the network
   access authentication procedure [RFC5779], i.e., before localized
   routing is initialized.  In this case, the preauthorized pairs of
   LMA/prefix sets can be downloaded to Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities
   during the RFC 5779 procedure.  Localized routing can be initiated
   once the destination of a received packet matches one or more of the
   prefixes received during the RFC 5779 procedure.

   Figure 2 shows an example scenario in which MAG1 acts as a Diameter
   client, processing the data packet from MN1 to MN2 and requesting
   authorization of localized routing (i.e.,MAG-Initiated LR
   authorization).  In this example scenario, MN1 and MN2 are attached
   to the same MAG and anchored to the different LMAs (i.e.,A12
   described in [RFC6279]).  In this case, MAG1 knows that MN2 belongs
   to a different LMA (which can be determined by looking up the binding
   cache entries corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and comparing the
   addresses of LMA1 and LMA2).  In order to setup a localized routing
   path with MAG2, MAG1 must first locate the entity that maintains the
   data required to setup the path (i.e., the LMA corresponding to MN2
   and MN1) by looking up the Binding Update List and then sending a
   Request message respectively to LMA1 and LMA2.  The request message
   is the Localized Routing Initialization (LRI) message in Figure 2 and
   belongs to the Initial phase of the localized routing.  The Diameter
   client in LMA1 sends an AAR message to the Diameter server.  The
   message contains an instance of the MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP
   ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.5) with the LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (
   [RFC5779],Section 5.5 ) set and an instance of the MIP6-Home-Link-
   Prefix AVP ([RFC5779], Section 5.3) or an instance of the PMIP6-IPv4-
   Home-Address AVP ([RFC5779], Section 5.2) containing the IP address/
   HNP of MN2.

   The Diameter server authorizes localized routing service by checking
   if MN2 is allowed to use localized routing.  If so, the Diameter
   server responds with an AAA message encapsulating an instance of the
   MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.5) with the the
   LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit ([RFC5779],Section 5.5) set
   indicating direct routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to the
   same MAG is supported and an instance of the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP
   [RFC5779] containing the IP address and/or Fully Qualified Domain
   Name (FQDN) of LMA corresponding to MN2 (i.e., LMA2).  LMA1 then

Internet-Draft       PMIP6 Localized Routing Support            May 2012


   knows the localized routing between MN1 and MN2 is allowed and
   verifies the IP address of LMA corresponding to MN2 using the data
   returned in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP.  In success case, LMA1 responds
   to MAG1 using the Localized Routing Acknowledge message (LRA in
   Figure 2) in accordance with [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr].

   Note: The signaling flow between LMA2 and AAA server is same as the
   signal flow between LMA1 and AAA server described in the Figure 2 and
   omitted in this example scenario.

          Figure 2: MAG-initiated Localized Routing Authorization

   Figure 3 shows the second example scenario, in which LMA1 acts as a
   Diameter client, processing the data packet from MN2 to MN1 and
   requesting the authorization of localized routing.  In this scenario,
   MN1 and MN2 are attached to the different MAG and anchored to the
   same LMA (i.e., A21 described in [RFC6279] ), LMA knows that MN1 and
   MN2 belong to the same LMA (which can be determined by looking up the
   binding cache entries corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and comparing the
   addresses of LMA corresponding to MN1 and LMA corresponding to MN2).
   In contrast with the signaling flow shown in Figure 2, it is LMA1
   instead of MAG1 which initiates the setup of the localized routing
   path.

   The Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AA-Request message to the
   Diameter server.  The message contains an instance of the MIP6-
   Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.5) with the
   INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (Section 4.4) set indicating direct
   routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to different MAGs is
   supported and either an instance of the MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP
   ([RFC5779], Section 5.3) or an instance of the PMIP6-IPv4-Home-

   Address AVP ([RFC5779], Section 5.2) containing the IP address/HNP of
   MN2.  The Diameter server authorizes the localized routing service by
   checking if MN2 is allowed to use localized routing.  If so, the
   Diameter server responds with an AA-Answer message encapsulating an
   instance of the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP [RFC5779] containing the IP
   address and/or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of LMA
   corresponding to MN2 (i.e.,LMA2) and an instance of the MIP6-Feature-
   Vector (MFV) AVP ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.5) with the
   INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit (Section 4.4) set indicating direct
   routing of IP packets between MNs anchored to different MAGs is
   supported.  LMA1 then knows the localized routing is allowed and
   verifies the IP address of LMA corresponding to MN2 using the data
   returned in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP.  In success case, LMA1 responds
   to MAG1 in accordance with [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr].

   Note: The signaling flow between LMA1 and AAA server shown in
   Figure 3 also applies to A22 described in RFC6279.  With returned
   LMA2 corresponding to MN2, LMA1 knows that MN2 belongs to a different
   LMA (i.e., LMA2) (i.e.,A22 described in [RFC6279]), LMA1 SHOULD
   initiate an exchange with LMA2 to trigger the corresponding LMA to
   setup binding entries on the corresponding MAG for localized routing
   and configure MAG1 and MAG2 to use the same encapsulation mechanism
   as that being used for the PMIP tunnel between the MAG and LMA
   without special configuration or dynamic tunneling negotiation
   between MAGs.  This case is mentioned in RFC 6279 but not addressed
   by [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr] and used here as an illustration of the
   capabilities provided by the AAA infrastructure.

          Figure 3: LMA-initiated Localized Routing Authorization

   Figure 4 shows another example scenario, in which LMA1 acts as a
   Diameter client, processing the data packet from MN2 to MN1 and

   requesting the authorization of localized routing.  In this scenario,
   MN1 and MN2 are attached to the same MAG and anchored to the same LMA
   (i.e., A11 described in [RFC6279]), LMA knows that MN1 and MN2 belong
   to the same LMA (which can be determined by looking up the binding
   cache entries corresponding to MN1 and MN2 and comparing the
   addresses of LMA corresponding to MN1 and LMA corresponding to MN2).

   The Diameter client in LMA1 sends an AA-Request message to the
   Diameter server.  The message contains an instance of the MIP6-
   Feature-Vector AVP ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.5) with the
   LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit set and either an instance of the
   MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP ([RFC5779], Section 5.3) or an instance of
   the PMIP6-IPv4-Home-Address AVP ([RFC5779], Section 5.2) containing
   the IP address/HNP of MN2.  The Diameter server authorizes the
   localized routing service by checking if MN2 is allowed to use
   localized routing.  If so, the Diameter server responds with an AA-
   Answer message encapsulating an instance of the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP
   [RFC5779] containing an instance of the MIP6-Feature-Vector (MFV) AVP
   ([RFC5447], Section 4.2.5) with the LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED bit
   ([RFC5779],Section 5.5) set indicating direct routing of IP packets
   between MNs anchored to the same MAG is supported and the IP address
   and/or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of LMA corresponding to MN2
   (i.e.,LMA2) .  LMA1 then knows the localized routing is allowed and
   verifies the IP address of LMA corresponding to MN2 using the data
   returned in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP.  In success case, LMA1 responds
   to MAG1 for localized routing in accordance with
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr].

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter NASREQ
   [I-D.ietf-dime-rfc4005bis] and Diameter Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5779]
   applications are also applicable to this document.

   The service authorization solicited by the MAG or the LMA relies upon
   the existing trust relationship between the MAG/LMA and the AAA
   server.

   An authorised MAG could in principle track the movement of any
   participating CNs at the level of the MAG to which they are anchored.
   If such a MAG were compromised, or under the control of a bad-actor,
   then such tracking could represent a privacy breach for the set of
   tracked CNs.  In such a case, the traffic pattern from the
   compromised MAG might be notable so monitoring for e.g. excessive
   queries from MAGs might be worthwhile.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new value in the Mobility Capability
   registry [RFC5447] for use with the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP:
   INTER_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED (see Section 4.4).
