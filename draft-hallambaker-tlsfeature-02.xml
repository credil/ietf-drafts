              The purpose of the TLS Feature extension is to prevent downgrade
              attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol.
              In particular, the TLS Feature extension may be used to mandate
              support for revocation checking features in the TLS protocol such as
              OCSP stapling. Informing clients that an OCSP status response will
              always be stapled permits an immediate failure in the case that the
              response is not stapled. This in turn prevents a denial of service
              attack that might otherwise be possible.

  <t>
    In order to avoid the confusion that would occur in attempting to
    describe an X.509 extension describing the use of TLS extensions, in this
    document the term 'extension' is reserved to refer to X.509v3
    extensions and the term 'feature' is used to refer to a TLS extension.
  </t>
</section>
    </section>
    <section title="Purpose">
      <t>
        The purpose of the TLS Feature extension is to prevent downgrade
        attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since the TLS protocol itself provides strong protection against most
        forms of downgrade attack including downgrade
        attacks against cipher suite choices offered and client credentials, the TLS Feature is only
        relevant to the validation of TLS protocol credentials. In particular
        to the revocation status of the server credentials presented.
      </t>

      <t>
        At the time of writing, the only TLS feature extensions that are relevant to the
        revocation status of credentials is the Certificate Status Request
        extension (status_request) Multiple Certificate Status Extension (status_request_v2)
        These extensions are used to support in-band exchange of
        OCSP tokens, otherwise known as OCSP stapling. These extensions are
        described in <xref target="RFC6066"/> and [draft-pettersen-tls-ext-multiple-ocsp-03].
      </t>

      <t>
        The OCSP stapling mechanism described in <xref target="RFC6066"/>
        permits a TLS server to provide evidence of valid certificate
        status inband. When this information is provided inband, the
        privacy, performance and reliability concerns arising from the need to make
        a third party connection during the TLS handshake are eliminated. A
        client cannot however draw any conclusion from the absence of inband
        status information unless it knows that the legitimate server would 
        have provided it. The status information might have been omitted because
        the server does not support the extension or because the server is 
        witholding the information intentionally, knowing the certificate to 
        be invalid.
      </t>
      <t>
        The inclusion of a TLS feature extension
        advertising the status_request feature in the server end entity certificate
        permits a client to fail immediately
        if the certificate status information is not provided by the server. The need to
        query the OCSP responder is eliminated entirely. This improves client efficiency and more
        importantly prevents a denial of service attack against the client by either blocking
        the OCSP response or mounting a denial of service attack against the OCSP responder.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since the TLS Feature extension is an option, it is not likely that an
        attacker attempting to obtain a certificate through fraud  will choose to
        have a certificate issued with this extension. Such risks are more
        approrpriately addressed by mechanisms such as Certificate Authority
        Authorization DNS records <xref target="RFC6844">RFC 6844</xref>
        that are designed to prevent or mitigate
        mis-issue. Nevertheless a Certification Authority MAY consider the
        presence or absence of a required TLS feature as one factor in determining
        the level of additional scruitiny a request should be subject to.
      </t>

     
      <t>
        A server offering an end entity certificate with a TLS feature extension 
        MUST satisfy a client request for the specified feature unless this would be
        redundant as described below.
        Otherwise clients MAY refuse connection. It is important therefore that
        a Certification Authority only issue certificates that specify features
        that match the configuration of the server and that the server is
        capable of verifying that its configuration is compatible with the
        feature declaration of the certificates it offers. Ideally, the TLS
        feature declaration would be specified by the certificate request generator
        as part of the certificate issue process.
      </t>
      <t>
        A client feature request is redundant if the purpose of the request is
        fully satisfied by another feature. For example, a server need not
        satisfy a client request for the status_request feature if  the
        status_request_v2 is offered and satisfied.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the case that the cached_information feature is offered and satisfied,
        a client request for the status_request or status_request_v2 features is 
        satisfied if and only if the cached credentials referenced include the 
        OCSP status information necessary to establish the certificate status.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document describes the use of the TLS feature in PKIX end entity and 
        certificate signing certificate and a mechanism that MAY be used to 
        describe support for the specified features in-band for the most commonly 
        used certificate registration protocol.

    <section title="Syntax">

        The TLS Feature extension has the following format:

      <t>
        The TLS Feature Extension SHOULD NOT be marked critical.   <xref target="RFC5280">RFC 5280</xref>
        requires
        that implementations that do not understand the extension MUST reject
        the certificate.
        Marking
        the TLS Feature Extension critical breaks backward compatibility and
        is not  recommended unless this is the desired behavior. Implementations that
        process the extension MUST ignore the criticality bit setting.
      </t>

    <section title="TLS Feature">
        <t>
          The TLS Feature extension lists a sequence of TLS extension identifiers 
          (features) that a TLS
          server
          compliant with the feature declaration MUST support and satisfy on client request.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification does not require a TLS client to offer or support
          any TLS feature regardless of whether it is specified in the server
          certificate's TLS
          Feature extension or not. In particular a client MAY request and a server
          MAY support any TLS extension regardless of whether it is specified
          in a TLS Feature extension or not.
        </t>
        <t>
          If a TLS Feature extension specifies a TLS feature, a server
          offering the certificate MUST support the extension specified and MUST
          comply with any specific requirements specified for that feature
          in this document or in the document that specifies the TLS feature.
        </t>

        <section title="status_request">
          <t>
            If the TLS status_request feature is specified in the TLS Feature
            extension and a TLS client specifies the status_request feature in the Client 
            Hello, a server MUST return a valid OCSP token for the specified
            server's End
            Entity certificate in the response.

          <t>
            If the certificate issue mechanism makes use of the PKCS#10 Certificate
            Signing Request (CSR) <xref target="RFC2986"/>, the CSR
            MAY specify a TLS Feature extension as a CSR attribute. A server
            or server administration tool should only generate key signing requests
            that it knows can be supported by the server for which the certificate is
            intended.

        </section>
        <section title="Certificate Signing Certificate">
          <t>
            When present in a Certificate Signing Certificate (i.e., CA certificate with the
            key usage extension value set to keyCertSign), the TLS Feature
            extension specifies a constraint on valid certificate chains. Specifically,
            a certificate that is signed by a Certificate Signing Certificate
            that contains a TLS Feature extension MUST contain a TLS Feature
            extension which MUST offer the same set or a superset of the features
            advertised in the signing certificate.
          </t>
          <t>
            While relying parites (i.e., clients) MAY reject certificates that do not comply with this
            requirement, the use of TLS Feature extension in Certificate Signing
            Certificates is primarily intended for use by parties seeking
            to evaluate the performance of certificate issuers and MAY be ignored by
            clients.

          <t>
            When specified in a server End Entity Certificate (i.e. a certificate that
            specifies the id-kp-server EKU), the TLS Feature
            extension specifies criteria that a server MUST meet to be compliant
            with the feature declaration.
          </t>
          <t>
            In the case that a client determines that the server configuration is
            inconsistent with the specified feature declaration it MAY reject the TLS configuration.

            In the case that a client determines that the server configuration is
            inconsistent with a feature declaration specifying support for the TLS status_request

          Use of the TLS Feature extension to mandate support for a particular

          protection in the case that a certificate with a TLS Feature
          is compromised after issue but not in the case that the attacker 
          obtains an unmarked certificate from an issuer through fraud.
        </t>
        <t>
          The TLS Feature extension is a post-issue security control. Such risks
          can only be addressed by security controls that take effect before issue.
