        IGP Extensions for Segment Routing Capable PCE Discovery
            draft-sivabalan-pce-disco-segment-routing-00.txt

Abstract

   When a PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in
   Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or a server participating in IGP,
   its presence and path computation capabilities can be advertised
   using IGP flooding.  Such IGP extensions exist for OSPF and ISIS to
   advertise several such capabilities.  Segment Routing (SR) leverages
   the source routing and tunneling pardigms in which a node steers a
   packet through the network using segments.  A segment can be an MPLS
   label or IPv6 header with a new extension.  In SR networks, a PCE can
   be used to compute paths using SR PCEP extension.  This document
   specifies additional capability to advertise a PCE that supports the
   new SR PCEP extension.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP),
   which defines the communication between a Path Computation Client
   (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE,
   enabling computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for
   Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
   enable stateful control of TE LSPs between and across PCEP sessions
   in compliance with [RFC4657].

   SR technology leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigms.
   A node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions,
   called segments, by prepending the packet with an SR header.  This
   technology enables any head-end node to select any path without
   relying on hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g., LDP or RSVP-TE).  It
   depends only on segments that are advertised by IGPs.  SR
   architecture is described in [SR-ARCH].  A SR path can be derived
   with an aid of a PCE.  Extension to PCE Protocol (PCEP) to support SR
   Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) path computation functionality is
   specified in [SR-PCEP].

Internet-Draft    Segment Routing capable PCE Discovery        July 2013


   When PCCs are LSRs participating in the IGP (OSPF or IS-IS), and PCEs
   are either LSRs or servers also participating in the IGP, an
   effective mechanism for PCE discovery within an IGP routing domain
   consists of utilizing IGP advertisements.  Such extension to OSPF and
   IS-IS exists in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089], respectively.

   Currently, the IGP PCE capability does not indicate whether the
   advertised PCE is capabable of supporting SR PCEP extension specified
   in [SR-PCEP].  Advertising such capability would facilitate a PCC to
   learn about available SR capable PCEs.  A PCC could listen to IGP
   updates, or use other mechanisms that carry IGP information to
   interested clients, such as BGP-LS ([I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution]).
   This document extends the IGP capability advertisement mechanism to
   include SR capability.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document:

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol
   IS-IS:  Intermediate System to Intermediate System
   LSR:  Label Switching Router
   OSPF:  Open Shortest Path First
   PCC:  Path Computation Client
   PCE:  Path Computation Element
   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol
   SR:  Segment Routing
   SR-TE:  Segment Routed Traffic Engineering

3.  IGP Extensions for SR Capability

   The PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV used to advertise
   PCE capabilities.  It MAY be present within the PCED sub-TLV carried
   by OSPF or IS-IS.  [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] provide the description
   and processing rules for this sub-TLV when carried within OSPF and
   IS-IS respectively.

   The PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV has the following format:

   o  TYPE: 5
   o  LENGTH: Multiple of 4

   o  VALUE: This contains an array of units of 32 bit flags with the
      most significant bit as 0.  Each bit represents one PCE capability

   PCE capability bits are defined in [RFC5088].  This document defines
   new capability bits for the SR capable PCE as follows:


    Bit         Capability
     13         Segment Routing PCE capability

4.  Backward Compatibility

   An LSR that does not support the new IGP PCE capability bits
   specified in this document silently ignores those bits.

   IGP extensions defined in this document do not introduce any new
   interoperability issues.

5.  Management Considerations

   A configuration option may be provided for advertising and
   withdrawing SR capability on a PCE.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations described in [RFC5088] are applicable to
   stateful PCE capabilities.  No additional security measures are
   required.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new bit in "PCE Capability Flags"
   registry for SR PCE capability as follows:

                    Bit           Meaning     Reference
                     13 SR PCE capability This document
