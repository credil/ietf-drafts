Internet-Draft                WG Consensus                   August 2012


1.  Introduction

   The IETF uses a consensus decision-making process to create Internet
   Standards and to standardize practices and the results of the
   deliberations of the IETF community.  The starting point is a
   proposal submitted as an Internet-Draft or a Birds of a Feather
   (BoF).  The proposal undergoes a period of development, generally
   within a working group, and several iterations of review before a
   final review by the IETF community.

   The decision-making process used in a working group is based on rough
   consensus.  Issues are sometimes raised during an IETF Last Call.
   This memo discusses about rough consensus and whether issues are
   raised because a working group has not given thorough consideration
   to the technical alternatives.


2.  Working Group

   A working group has a charter which describes the problem(s) to be
   solved, the deliverables to be produced and milestones for the
   deliverables.

2.1.  Rough consensus

   Consensus does not require complete agreement; one way to describe it
   is that everyone is willing to accept a decision.

   To create a climate of consensus, it is up to the working group to
   give thorough consideration to technical alternatives and to ensure
   that issues have been given due consideration.  Although only rough
   consensus is required, issues which are hand-waived by a working
   group can surface again during the IETF Last Call jeopardizing the
   efforts of the working group.

   It is up to the Working Chair and the Working Group to ensure that
   consensus, or at least rough consensus, can be achieved.

2.2.  Dissenting views

   Dissenting views can go unheard.  Some participants overcome that by
   re-posting their arguments and end up being labelled as vocal
   participants.  Controversies are fueled by inflamatory statements,
   personal attacks or subtle condescending comments.

2.3.  Cross-area

   A working group has a narrow view of a problem.  It is difficult to
   attract expertise from other areas as people are busy or they do not
   have a stake in the solution to bother commenting on it.  Even when
   there are people with such expertise, they might be ignored when they
   provide advice if it will slow down the work or it does not fit
   within the solution that the working group is willing to hear.

2.4.  Summarizing the discussion

   It is not always obvious for a participant following a discussion to
   understand the diverse viewpoints, e.g. the discussion generates a
   high volume of messages covering minute technical details or issues
   which seem unrelated to the subject of contention.  Instead of
   summarizing the discussion, it is assumed that the the participants
   understood each other.

2.5.  Conflict of interest

   A decision-making process leads to conflict if it is not viewed as
   fair and open.  Such conflicts can arise through misunderstandings
   or, sometimes, self-interest.  Conflict of interest could be
   construed as when the person taking the decision shares the primary
   affiliation, e.g. they work for the same company, as the person(s)
   affected by the decision.

   The affiliation of a person in a working group is not always obvious
   nowadays as the person might be using a email address from a vanity
   domain or a free account instead of one from the company he/she works
   for.  Working Group editors generally mention the company they work
   for in drafts.  It is awkward for a participant to ask a Working
   Group Chair to disclose the information.  A participant can contact
   the Responsible Area if there is an issue about conflict of interest.

   A person sometimes has secondary affiliations, e.g. to an interest
   group or organization which derives a benefit from the work being
   carried out.  Such affiliations are rarely disclosed.  There is an
   assumption that the disclosure of primary affiliation is enough to
   determine the interests of a person.

   It has been said that participation in the IETF is on individual
   basis.  If the stakes are high enough, a person might align himself/
   herself on a position influenced by external parties.

3.  Last Call

   An IETF Last Call is a way to determine the consensus of the IETF
   community.  Issues which are not considered as adequately addressed
   are raised during a Last Call and can be the cause of heated
   discussions.

   It is up to IETF participants to send comments to explain why a
   proposed action should not be taken.  The decision taken by the IESG
   is generally based on the substantive comments submitted by IETF
   participants.


4.  Security Considerations

   By failing to identify the issues, a working group might overlook
   security concerns.  A working group relies on its participants to
   perform "due diligence".


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA actions.


6.  Acknowledgements

Appendix A.  Birds of a feather

   A Birds of a Feather (BoF) is a session at an IETF meeting which
   permits "market research" and technical "brainstorming".  It can be
   used to determine whether there is enough interest and focus in a
   subject to warrant the formation of a working group.  There are
   discussions on a mailing list before the BoF to explore the issues
   and for the participants to share their views about a common
   approach.

   Participants are not always enthusiastic to review working group
   drafts; they demonstrate interest to work during this initial stage
   or when a working group is being closed.

   Mailing list discussions before the formation of a working group
   generally turn into debates about technical decisions.  Although such
   discussions could be seen as an exploration of the issues, there is a
   loss of focus as participants spend time on minute details.  It can

   be easier to reach rough consensus if participants were to explain
   what they want and suggest an approach which is aligned with their
   interests while taking into account the interests of the group.

   Sometimes some participants are just not listening to what other
   participants are saying.  Somebody needs to help shape the discussion
   when that happens.
