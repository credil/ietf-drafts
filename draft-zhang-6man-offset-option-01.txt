                  An Offset Indicating Option for IPv6
                   draft-zhang-6man-offset-option-01

Abstract

   This document defines an Offset Indicating option (OI option)
   encapsulated within an IPv6 Options header.  An OI option can provide
   offset information to locate the end of the IPv6 header chain so that
   a node receiving an IPv6 packet is able to skip over the IP header
   chain and access the transport header or other protocol data unit
   directly.

Internet-Draft          Offset Indicating Option          September 2011


1.  Introduction

   According to [RFC2460], when a node intends to access the payload of
   an IPv6 packet, it needs to parse the extension headers one by one
   until it reaches the end of the header chain.  This approach may be
   inefficient for nodes which have no interest in the extension headers
   and intend to quickly access the payload of IPv6 packets.

   A common case is any form of flow classification requiring access to
   the basic IP header 5-tuple {destination address, source address,
   protocol, destination port, source port}.  The last three elements
   are only available by following the extension header chain to its
   end.  This could be required for various forms of quality of service
   support or for flow logging purposes.  Another case would be any form
   of deep packet inspection requiring rapid access to the payload,
   which also requires skipping over the header chain.  If packets must
   be processed at line speed, this can be a significant performance
   issue.  A method is needed to short-circuit this process.

   A brief discussion of this issue from a security standpoint is
   provided in Section 2.1.9.2 of [RFC4942].  In addition, most existing
   firewall implementations have the capability to verify the
   correctness of IP headers.  Therefore, in some cases, it may be more
   efficient for the equipment behind a firewall, such as a host or a
   deep packet inspection device, to skip over the extension headers of
   the IP packets it receives and access the payload directly.

   This document addresses this issue by introducing an Offset
   Indicating option (OI option for short) which indicates the end of
   the header chain.  The option is transferred in an IPv6 Options
   header.  If there is an existing Hop-by-Hop Options header, the OI
   option will be in it.  Otherwise, it will be in a Destination Options
   header.  According to the recommendations in [RFC2460], this will
   always place the OI option at the beginning of the header chain.
   Therefore, if necessary, a node receiving an IPv6 packet can jump
   over the whole header chain in a single step to directly access the
   transport header or other protocol data unit.

   This option is an optimization option for certain forwarding nodes.
   It may be safely ignored by nodes that have no interest in the header
   chain.  Hence, it does not create any performance degradation.  In
   particular, unless there is a Hop-by-Hop Options header for some
   other reason, it does not create any overhead for simple forwarding
   nodes.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Format of the Offset Indicating option

   The format of the Offset Indicating option (OI) option is described
   in Figure 1.

   Figure 1.  Option Format

   Option Type: 8 bits.  The value is TBD1.

   Note to RFC Editor: please replace TBD1 with the value assigned by
   IANA and delete this note.

   Opt Data Len: as defined in [RFC2460].

   Offset: 16 bits.  Indicates the distance (in octets) from the end of
   the option to the end of the header chain.

   NH (Next Header) after Jump: 8 bits.  Indicates the type of the
   transport header or other protocol data unit after the header chain.
   This MUST equal the Next Header value in the last Extension Header in
   the packet.


4.  Processing Rules

   IPv6 source nodes SHOULD insert this option in every packet that
   contains at least one extension header of any kind, in order to
   maximise its usefulness.  However, it MUST NOT be inserted in packets
   that include a Fragment Header, to avoid the case where the offset
   points beyond the end of the first fragment.  In any case,
   performance optimisation is impossible in the case of fragmented
   packets.

   Because the options within a header must be processed strictly in the

   order that they appear, the OI option is RECOMMENDED to be the first
   option within an Options header.  This arrangement will maximize the
   effect of optimization for those routers that use it.

   A Hop-by-Hop Options header MUST NOT be created solely for the
   purpose of carrying the OI option.  If and only if the packet
   contains a Hop-by-Hop Options header for some other reason, the OI
   option is placed in it.  Otherwise it is placed in a Destination
   Options header.

   This option has an alignment requirement of 4n + 2.  (See Section 4.2
   of [RFC2460] for discussion of option alignment.)  If this option is
   located first within the Options header, the alignment reqirement is
   met naturally; otherwise the host stack that assembles the IPv6
   header needs to meet the alignment requirement according to the
   context by inserting padding options.

   The OI option is defined on the basis that the size of extension
   headers does not change en-route.  However, if a future extension
   header type allows an intermediate device to add additional
   information in the IP extension header chain, this device MUST also
   update the value of the Offset field to point to the new position of
   the payload header.

   If an intermediate device detects that the OI option does not point
   to a valid transport header, the IPv6 packet MUST be discarded.


5.  Security Considerations

   The OI option provides a method for nodes which have no interest in
   parsing the header chain to quickly process IP packets.  Because
   transport layer security protocols do not cover extension headers,
   and the information in the IPv6 header is sufficient to generate the
   pseudo-header for upper layer protocols, the skipping of extension
   headers will not impact the security verification performed by
   transport layer security protocols.  However, in IPsec the situation
   is a little different.  Because the ESP header [RFC4303] or the AH
   header [RFC4302] consist of critical information to process the IPsec
   packet and the extension headers after the ESP or AH header may have
   to be authenticated or encrypted, these extension headers cannot be
   skipped over.  Therefore, a IPsec implementation MUST NOT skip to the
   end of the header chain under the instruction of the OI option.

   This specification disallows use of the OI option in fragmented
   packets.  In addition to efficiency considerations, this prevents the
   option from becoming a vector for a buffer overflow attack.

   Attackers cannot use the OI option to hide any undesired information
   in the IPv6 header, because this option is only an optional
   indication for intermediate devices that do not in any case wish to
   inspect such information.  Security devices may simply ignore this
   indication and verify every extension header in the chain.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the IPv6 Option Type TBD1 for the Offset
   Indicating Option and record it in the IPv6 Destination Options and
   Hop-by-Hop Options registry.

   In accordance with Section 4.2 of [RFC2460], this option type has the
   two most significant bits set to 00 (skip if unrecognized) and the
   third-highest-order bit set to 1 (option data may change en-route).
   This is in case a future IPv6 extension header type may be defined
   whose size may change en-route, requiring the Offset value to be
   updated.

   Note to RFC Editor: please replace TBD1 with the value assigned by
   IANA and delete this note.
