   The "Typed Wildcard Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Element" 
   defines an extension to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) that 
   can be used when it is desired to request or withdraw or release all 
   label bindings for a given FEC Element type.  However, a typed 
   wildcard FEC element must be individually defined for each FEC 
   element type.  This specification defines the typed wildcard FEC 
   elements for the PWid (0x80), Generalized PWid (0x81), and P2MP PW 
   (0x82) FEC element types.

Internet-Draft     LDP PW Typed Wildcard FEC Elements    January 2012 
         

1. Introduction 

   An extension [RFC5918] to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) 
   [RFC5036] defines the general notion of a "Typed Wildcard Forwarding 
   Equivalence Class (FEC) Element".  This can be used when it is 
   desired to request all label bindings for a given type of FEC 
   Element, or to release or withdraw all label bindings for a given 
   type of FEC element.  However, a typed wildcard FEC element must be 
   individually defined for each type of FEC element. 

   [RFC4447] defines the "PWid FEC Element" and "Generalized PWid FEC 
   Element", and [P2MP-PW] defines the "P2MP PW FEC Element". These 
   specifications, however, do not specify the Typed Wildcard format 
   for these elements. This document specifies the format of the Typed 
   Wildcard FEC Element for the "PWid FEC Element", "Generalized PWid 
   FEC Element", and "P2MP FEC Element". The procedures for Typed 
   Wildcard processing for PWid, Generalized PWid, and P2MP FEC 
   Elements are same as described in [RFC5918] for any typed wildcard 
   FEC Element type. 

2. Typed Wildcard for PW FEC Elements 

   The format of the Typed Wildcard FEC Element for PWid, Generalized 
   PWid, and P2MP PW FEC Elements is specified as: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |Typed Wcard=0x5| Type=PW FEC   |   Len = 2     |R|   PW type   |

                                   Types 
   Where:  

      Typed Wcard (one octet): Typed Wildcard FEC element type (0x05) 
           as specified in [RFC5918]     

      [FEC Element] Type (one octet): PW FEC Element type: 

        PWid: (type 0x80 [RFC4447]) 
        Generalized PWid: (type 0x81 [RFC4447]) 
        P2MP PW: (type 0x82, [P2MP-PW]

Internet-Draft     LDP PW Typed Wildcard FEC Elements    January 2012 
         

            
      Len [FEC Type Info] (one octet):  Two. (i.e. there is additional 
           FEC info to scope the Typed Wildcard) 

      R bit (Reserved bit): Must be set to ZERO on transmit and ignored 
           on receipt. 

      PW type (15-bits): PW type as specified in [RFC4447]. This field 
           is used to scope the PWid wildcard FEC operation to limit to 
           all PWs of a given type. This MUST be set to "Wildcard" type 
           (0x7FFF), as defined by[IANA-PWE3], when referring PWs of 
           all types (see Section 4 for its usage).  

  [RFC4447] defines "PW Grouping ID TLV" that can be used for wildcard 
  withdrawal or status messages related to Generalized PWid and P2MP PW 
  FECs. When Typed Wildcard FEC for Generalized PWid or P2MP PW FEC 
  element is in use, "PW Grouping ID TLV" MUST NOT be present in the 
  same message. If found present, the receiving LSR MUST ignore this 
  TLV silently, and process the rest of the message. 
 
3. Applicability Statement 

   The Typed wildcard FEC Elements defined in this document for the 
   PWid, Generalized PWid, and P2MP PW FEC Elements provide a finer 
   degree of granularity when compared to the Wildcard FEC mechanics 
   defined in [RFC5036]. 

   The PWid FEC Element as defined in [RFC4447] contains a Group ID 
   field. This field is defined as an arbitrary 32-bit value that 
   represents a group of PWs, and is used to create groups in the PW 
   space, including potentially a single group of all PWs for a given 
   FEC Element type. This grouping enables an LSR to send wildcard 
   label withdrawals and/or status notification messages corresponding 
   to a PW group upon physical port failures. Similarly, [RFC4447] 
   defines the "PW Grouping ID TLV" used in the same fashion for the 
   Generalized PWid and P2MP PW FEC Elements.  

  The PW Typed Wildcard FEC elements defined in this document help us 
  achieve the similar functionality as "Group ID" field or "PW Grouping 
  ID TLV" for label withdrawal and status notification messages; 
  Additionally, the Typed Wildcard procedures [RFC5918] also provide 
  more generalized and comprehensive solution by allowing: 
  1. Typed-Wildcard Label Request messages 


 
 
Raza, et. al              Expires July 2012                    [Page 4] 
         
Internet-Draft     LDP PW Typed Wildcard FEC Elements    January 2012 
    

  2. Label TLV in label messages to further constraint the wildcard to 
      all FECs of the specified FEC type [and its specific filter] that 
      are also bound to the specified label.  
 
4. Operation 

   The use of Typed Wildcard FEC elements for PW can be useful under 
   several scenarios. This section describes some use cases to 
   illustrate their usage. The following use cases consider two LSR 
   nodes, A and B, with LDP session between them to exchange L2VPN PW 
   bindings. 

4.1. PW Consistency Check 

   A user may request a control plane consistency check at LSR A for 
   the Generalized PWid FEC bindings that it had learnt from LSR B over 
   LDP session.  To perform this consistency check, LSR A marks all its 
   learnt Generalized PWid FEC bindings from LSR B as stale, and then 
   sends a Label Request message towards LSR B for Typed Wildcard FEC 
   element for Generalized PWid FEC element type with PW type set to 
   "Wildcard" (0x7FFF). Upon receipt of such request, LSR B replays its 
   database related to Generalized PWid FEC element using one or more 
   Label Mapping messages. As a PW binding is received at LSR A, the 
   associated binding state is marked as refreshed (no stale).  When 
   replay completes for Generalized PWid FEC type, LSR B marks end of 
   its replay by sending End-of-LIB notification [RFC5919] 
   corresponding to Generalized PWid FEC element type. Upon receipt of 
   this notification at LSR A, any remaining stale PW binding of 
   Generalized PWid FEC type learnt from the peer LSR B, is cleaned up 
   and removed from the database. This completes consistency check with 
   LSR B at LSR A for Generalized Pwid FEC type. 

4.2. PW Graceful Shutdown 

   It may be desirable to perform shutdown/removal of existing PW 
   bindings advertised towards a peer in a graceful manner -- i.e. all 
   advertised PW bindings to be removed from a peer without session 
   flap.  For example, to request a graceful delete of the PWid FEC and 
   Generalized PWid FEC bindings at LSR A learnt from LSR B, LSR A 
   would send a Label Withdraw message towards LSR B with Typed 
   Wildcard FEC elements pertaining to PWid FEC element (with PW type 
   set to 0x7FFF) and Generalized PWid FEC element (with PW type set to 
   0x7FFF). Upon receipt of such message, LSR B will delete all PWid 
   and Generalized PWid bindings learnt from LSR A. Afterwards, LSR B 
   would send Label Release messages corresponding to received Label 
   Withdraw messages with Typed FEC element.

Internet-Draft     LDP PW Typed Wildcard FEC Elements    January 2012 
    

4.3. Wildcard PW Status 

  The Typed Wildcard FEC Elements for PW FECs can be very useful when 
  used to convey PW status amongst LSRs. The PE devices can send "PW 
  Status TLV" in an LDP Notification message to indicate PW status 
  (i.e., a Pseudowire Status Code denoting for example a particular 
  fault) to their remote peers [RFC4447]. In case of a global failure 
  affecting all PWs, an LSR typically sends one PW Status LDP 
  Notification message per PW. This per PW Status message has 
  scalability implications in a large scale network with large number 
  of PWs.  
   
  Using Typed Wildcard FEC Element for given type of PW FEC Element, 
  the LSR will need to send only one PW Status Notification message 
  with Typed Wildcard PW FEC specified to notify about the common 
  status applicable to all PWs as scoped by the PW Typed Wildcard FEC. 
 
5. Security Considerations 

  No new security considerations beyond that apply to the base LDP 
  specification [RFC5036], [RFC4447] and [RFC5920] apply to the use of 
  the PW Typed Wildcard FEC Element types described in this document. 
   
6. IANA Considerations 

  None.
