Abstract

   Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by protocols like
   LDP, RSVP and LBGP. All of those protocols are session oriented.  In
   order to obtain label binding for a given destination FEC from a
   given router one needs first to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session
   with that router.

   Advertising MPLS labels in IGPs advertisement [I-D.gredler-rtgwg-igp-
   label-advertisement] describes several use cases where utilizing the
   flooding machinery of link-state protocols for MPLS label
   distribution allows to obtain the binding without requiring to
   establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session with that router.

   This document describes the protocol extension to distribute MPLS
   labels by the IS-IS protocol.

Internet-Draft      Advertising MPLS labels in IS-IS          April 2013


   MPLS label allocations are predominantly distributed by using the LDP
   [RFC5036], RSVP [RFC5151] or labeled BGP [RFC3107] protocol.  All of
   those protocols have in common that they are session oriented, which
   means that in order to obtain label binding for a given destination
   FEC from a given router one needs first to establish a direct control
   plane (LDP/RSVP/LBGP) session with that router.

   There are a couple of use cases [I-D.gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-
   advertisement] where the consumer of a MPLS label binding may not be
   adjacent to the router that performs the binding.  Bringing up an
   explicit session using the existing label distribution protocols
   between the non-adjacent router that bind the label and the router
   that acts as a consumer of this binding is the existing remedy for
   this dilemma.

   This document describes a single IS-IS protocol extension which
   allows routers to advertise MPLS label bindings within and beyond an
   IGP domain, and controlling inter-area distribution.

2.  Motivation, Rationale and Applicability

   One possible way of distributing MPLS labels using IS-IS has been
   described in Segment Routing [I-D.previdi-filsfils-isis-segment-
   routing].  The authors propose to re-use the IS-Reach TLVs (22, 23,
   222) and Extended IP Prefix TLVs (135, 236) for carrying the label
   information.  While retrofitting existing protocol machinery for new
   purposes is generally a good thing, Segment Routing [I-D.previdi-
   filsfils-isis-segment-routing] falls short of addressing some use-
   cases defined in [I-D.gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-advertisement].

   The dominant issue around re-using IS-Reach TLVs and the extended IP
   Prefix TLVs is that both family of TLVs have existing protocol
   semantics, which might not be well suitable to advertising MPLS label
   switched paths in a generic fashion.  These are specifically:

   o  Bi-directionality semantics

   o  IP path semantics

   o  Lack of 'path' notion

2.1.  Issue: Bi-directionality semantics

   'Bi-directionality semantics', affects the complexity around
   advertisement of unidirectional LSPs.  Label advertisement of per-
   link labels or 'Adj-SIDs' [I-D.previdi-filsfils-isis-segment-routing]
   is done using IS-reach TLVs.  Usually implementations need to have an
   adjacency in 'Up' state prior to advertising this adjacency as IS-
   reach TLV in its Link State PDUs (LSPs).  In order to advertise a
   per-link LSP an implementation first needs to have an adjacency,
   which only transitions to 'Up' state after passing the 3-way check.
   This implies bi-directionality.  If an implementation wants to
   advertise per-link LSPs to e.g.  outside the IGP domain then it would
   need to fake-up an adjacency.  Changing existing IGP Adjacency code
   to support such cases defeats the purpose of re-using existing
   functionality as there is not much common functionality to be shared.

2.2.  Issue: IP path semantics

   LSPs pointing to a Node are advertised as 'Node-SIDs' [I-D.previdi-
   filsfils-isis-segment-routing] using the family of extended IP Reach
   TLVs.  That means that in order to advertise a LSP, one is inheriting
   the semantics of advertising an IP path.  Consider router A has got
   existing LSPs to its entire one-hop neighborhood and is re-
   advertising those LSPs using IP reachability semantics.  Now we have
   two exact matching IP advertisements.  One from the owning router
   (router B) which advertises its stable transport loopback address and
   another one from router A re-advertising a LSP path to router B.
   Existing routing software may get confused now as the 'stable
   transport' address shows up from multiple places in the network and
   more worse the IP forwarding path for control-plane protocols may get
   mingled with the MPLS data plane.

2.3.  Issue: Lack of 'path' notion

   Both IS-Reach TLVs and IP Prefix Reachability TLVs have a limited
   semantics describing MPLS label-switched paths in the sense of a
   'path'.  Both encoding formats allow to specify a pointer to some
   specific router, but not to describe a MPLS label switched path
   containing all of its path segments.  [I-D.previdi-filsfils-isis-
   segment-routing] allows to define 'Forwarding Adjacencies' as per
   [RFC4206].  The way to describe a path of a given forwarding
   adjacency is to carry a list of "Segment IDs".  That implies that
   nodes which do not yet participate in 'Segment routing' or are
   outside of a 'Segment routing' domain can not be expressed using
   those path semantics.

   A protocol for advertising MPLS label switched paths, should be
   generic enough to express paths sourced by existing MPLS LSPs, such
   that ingress routers can flexibly combine them according to
   application needs.

2.4.  Motivation

   IGP advertisement of MPLS label switched paths requires a new set of
   protocol semantics (path paradigm), which hardly can be expressed
   using the existing IS-IS protocol.  This document describes IS-IS
   protocol extensions which allows generic advertisement of MPLS label
   switched paths in IS-IS.

3.  MPLS label TLV

   The MPLS Label TLV may be originated by any Traffic Engineering
   [RFC5305] capable router in an IS-IS domain.  A router may advertise
   MPLS labels along with so called 'ERO' path segments describing the
   label switched path.  Since ERO style path notation allows to express
   pointers to link and node IP addresses any label switched path,
   sourced by any protocol can be described.

   Due to the limited size of subTLV space (See [RFC5311] section 4.5
   for details), The MPLS Label TLV has cumulative rather than canceling
   semantics.  If a router originates more than one MPLS Label TLV with
   the same Label value, then the subTLVs of the second, third, etc.
   TLV are accumulated.  Since some subTLVs represent an ordered set
   (e.g.  ERO subTLVs) and in order to not complicate the cross-fragment
   tracking logic, all subTLVs for a given label value MUST be present
   in a single IS-IS fragment.

   The MPLS Label TLV has type 149 and has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   o  4 bits of flags, consisting of:

      *  1 bit of up/down information (U bit)

      *  3 bits are reserved for future use

   o  20 bits of MPLS label information

   o  0-252 octets of sub-TLVs, where each sub-TLV consists of a
      sequence of:

      *  1 octet of sub-TLV type

      *  1 octet of length of the value field of the sub-TLV

      *  0-250 octets of value

Internet-Draft      Advertising MPLS labels in IS-IS          April 2013


   Flags

      Up/Down Bit: A router may flood MPLS label information across
      level boundaries.  In order to prevent flooding loops, a router
      will Set the Up/Down (U-Bit) when propagating from Level 2 down to
      Level 1. This is done as per the procedures for IP Prefixes lined
      out in [RFC5302].

3.2.  subTLV support

   An originating router MAY want to attach one or more subTLVs to the
   MPLS label TLV.  SubTLVs presence is inferred from the length of the
   MPLS Label TLV.  If the MPLS Label TLV Length field is > 3 octets
   then one or more subTLVs may be present.

3.3.  IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV

   The IPv4 ERO subTLV (Type 1) describes a path segment using IPv4
   Prefix style of encoding.  Its appearance and semantics have been
   borrowed from Section 4.3.3.2 [RFC3209].

   The 'Prefix Length' field contains the length of the prefix in bits.
   Only the most significant octets of the prefix are encoded.  I.e.  1
   octet for prefix length 1 up to 8, 2 octets for prefix length 9 to
   16, 3 octets for prefix length 17 up to 24 and 4 octets for prefix
   length 25 up to 32, etc.

   The 'L' bit in the subTLV is a one-bit attribute.  If the L bit is
   set, then the value of the attribute is 'loose.'  Otherwise, the
   value of the attribute is 'strict.'

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |L|    Type     |     Length    | Prefix Length |  IPv4 Prefix  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | IPv4 Prefix  (continued, variable-length      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   

3.4.  IPv6 Prefix ERO subTLV

   The IPv6 ERO subTLV (Type 2) describes a path segment using IPv6
   Prefix style of encoding.  Its appearance and semantics have been
   borrowed from Section 4.3.3.3 [RFC3209].

   The 'Prefix Length' field contains the length of the prefix in bits.
   Only the most significant octets of the prefix are encoded.  I.e.  1
   octet for prefix length 1 up to 8, 2 octets for prefix length 9 to
   16, 3 octets for prefix length 17 up to 24 and 4 octets for prefix
   length 25 up to 32, ...., 16 octets for prefix length 113 up to 128.

   The 'L' bit in the subTLV is a one-bit attribute.  If the L bit is
   set, then the value of the attribute is 'loose.'  Otherwise, the
   value of the attribute is 'strict.'

3.5.  Prefix ERO subTLV path semantics

   All 'Prefix ERO' information represents an ordered set which
   describes the segments of a label-switched path.  The last Prefix ERO
   subTLV describes the segment closest to the egress point of the LSP.
   Contrary the first Prefix ERO subTLV describes the first segment of a
   label switched path.  If a router extends or stitches a label
   switched path it MUST prepend the new segments path information to
   the Prefix ERO list.

4.2.  One-hop LSP to an adjacent Router

   If R1 would advertise a label <N> bound to a one-hop LSP from R1 to
   R2 it would encode as follows:

      TLV 149: MPLS label N, Flags {}:

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.2/32, Strict

4.3.  One-hop LSP to an adjacent Router using a specific link

   If R2 would advertise a label <N>bound to a one-hop LSP from R2 to
   R3, using the link #2 it would encode as follows

      TLV 149: MPLS label <N>, Flags {}:

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 10.0.0.6/32, Strict

4.4.  Advertisement of an RSVP LSP

   Consider a RSVP LSP name "R2-to-R6" traversing (R2 to R3 using link
   #1, R6):

   If R2 would advertise a label <N> bound to the RSVP LSP named
   'R2-to-R6', it would encode as follows

      TLV 149: MPLS label <N>, Flags {}:

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 10.0.0.4/32, Strict

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.6/32, Strict

4.5.  Advertisement of an LDP LSP

   Consider R2 that creates a LDP label binding for FEC 172.16.0.0./12
   using label <N>.

   If R2 would re-advertise this binding in IS-IS it would encode as
   follows

      TLV 149: MPLS label <N>, Flags {}:

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 172.16.0.0/12, Loose

Internet-Draft      Advertising MPLS labels in IS-IS          April 2013


   Consider two R5->R3 paths: {R5, R2, R3} and {R5, R6, R3}

   R2 encodes its two paths to R6 as follows:

      TLV 149: MPLS label <N1>, Flags {}:

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.3, Strict

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.6, Strict

      TLV 149: MPLS label <N2>, Flags {}:

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.5, Strict

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.6, Strict

   R5 encodes its two paths to R3 as follows:

      TLV 149: MPLS label <N1>, Flags {}:

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.2, Strict

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.3, Strict

      TLV 149: MPLS label <N2>, Flags {}:

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.6, Strict

         IPv4 Prefix ERO subTLV: 192.168.1.3, Strict

   A receiving L1 router does see now all 4 paths and may decide to
   load-balance across all or a subset of them.

5.  Inter Area Protocol Procedures

5.1.  Applicability

   Propagation of a MPLS LSP across a level boundary is a local policy
   decision.

5.2.  Data plane operations

   If local policy dictates that a given L1L2 router needs to re-
   advertise a MPLS LSPs from one Level to another then it MUST allocate
   a new label and program its label forwarding table to connect the new
   label to the path in the respective other level.  Depending on how to
   reach the re-advertised LSP, this is typically done using a MPLS
   'SWAP' or 'SWAP/PUSH' data plane operation.

5.3.  Control plane operations

Internet-Draft      Advertising MPLS labels in IS-IS          April 2013


   If local policy dictates that a given L1L2 router needs to re-
   advertise a MPLS LSPs from one Level to another then it must prepend
   its "Traffic-Engineering-ID" as a loose hop in the Prefix ERO subTLV
   list.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This documents request allocation for the following TLVs and subTLVs.

   +-----+------------+-----------------+------+---------+------------+
   | PDU | TLV        | subTLV          | Type | subType | #Occurence |
   +-----+------------+-----------------+------+---------+------------+
   | LSP | MPLS Label |                 | 149  |         |        >=0 |
   |     |            | IPv4 Prefix ERO |      | 1       |        >=0 |
   |     |            | IPv6 Prefix ERO |      | 2       |        >=0 |
   +-----+------------+-----------------+------+---------+------------+

   The MPLS Label TLV requires a new sub-registry.  Type value 149 has
   been assigned, with a starting sub-TLV value of 1, range from 1-127,
   and managed by Expert Review.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any change in terms of IS-IS
   security.  It simply proposes to flood MPLS label information via the
   IGP.  All existing procedures to ensure message integrity do apply
   here.
