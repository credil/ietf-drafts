1.  Introduction

   One application for Seamless Bidrectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
   [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] is to perform full and partial
   reachability validations on IP and IP signalled MPLS environments.

   This specification defines procedures to use Seamless BFD in IP and
   IP signalled MPLS environments.

2.  BFD Target Identifier Type

   BFD target identifier type of value 1 is used for IPv4 addresses and
   router IDs.  This identifier type will cover Seamless BFD in
   following scenarios:

   o  BFD control packets IPv4 routed.

   o  BFD control packets IPv6 routed.

   o  BFD control packets label switched in IPv4 signaled LSP.

   o  BFD control packets label switched in IPv6 signaled LSP.

   Not all IPv6 aspects are covered by this specification, and details
   are clarified in Section 3.

3.  Reserved BFD Discriminators

   With IPv4 based BFD, BFD target identifier type 1 is used.  BFD
   discriminator values corresponding to all or subset of local IPv4
   addresses are to be reserved.  IPv4 addresses are used as BFD
   discriminators.  Corresponding BFD discriminators MUST be reserved
   and those BFD discriminators MUST NOT be used for other BFD sessions.

   Example:

   o  BFD Target Identifier Type 1: IPv4 address 3.3.2.1 maps to BFD
      discriminator 0x03030201.

   With IPv6 based BFD, BFD target identifier type 1 is used.  BFD
   discriminator values corresponding to all or subset of local IGP
   Router IDs are to be reserved.  These router IDs are used as BFD
   discriminators.  With OSPFv3, employed 32 bit router IDs are used.
   Corresponding BFD discriminators MUST be reserved and those BFD
   discriminators MUST NOT be used for other BFD sessions.  ISIS is not
   included as part of this identifier type, and is outside the scope of
   this document.

   Example:

   o  BFD Target Identifier Type 1: Router-ID 3.3.4.5 maps to BFD
      discriminator 0x03030405.

   Note that it is acceptable for an IPv4 address and a router-ID to
   collide, mapping into a same BFD discriminator value.  There will not
   be an issue as long as colliding BFD discriminator value is reserved
   for the Seamless BFD purpose.

4.  BFD Target Identifier Table

   With IP identifier type, only locally reserved BFD discriminators and
   corresponding information are to be in this table.  No inter-node
   communications are needed to exchange BFD discriminator and BFD
   target identifier mappings.

5.  Full Reachability Validations

5.1.  Initiator Behavior

   Any IP network node can attempt to perform a full reachability
   validation to any BFD target identifier of type 1 (IPv4 address or

   router-ID) on other network nodes, as long as destination BFD target
   identifier is provisioned to use this mechanism.  Transmitted BFD
   control packet by the initiator is to have "your discriminator"
   corresponding to destination BFD target identifier of type 1.

   Initiator is to use following procedures to construct BFD control
   packets to perform IP full reachability validations on BFD packets
   that are IP routed:

   o  MUST set "your discriminator" to target IPv4 address or target
      router-ID.
   o  If packet is to be explicitly label switched, then explicit label
      switching packet format described in [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base]
      MUST be used.  Otherwise IP routing packet format described in
      [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] MUST be used.

5.2.  Responder Behavior

   To respond to received BFD control packet which was targeted to local
   BFD target identifier of type 1 (IP ddress or router-ID), response
   BFD control packet is targeted to IP address taken from received
   "source IP address".  Responder MUST validate obtained IP address is
   in valid format (ex: not Martian address).  Responder MUST consult
   local routing table to ensure obtained IP address is reachable.

6.  Partial Reachability Validations

   Procedures described in [I-D.akiya-bfd-seamless-base] applies.

7.  MPLS Label Verifications

   MPLS label verification mechanism is applicable to those IP based BFD
   which use explicit label switching techniques.  However, details of
   what responder embeds in the lower 23 bits of localhost address, and
   how initiator determines correctness of label programming is outside
   the scope of this document.

8.  Provisiong Active IP Sessions

   Active IP BFD sessions, single-hop, multi-hop or MPLS can be
   instantiated on any network node using this mechanism to any IPv4
   target addresses and OSPFv3 router IDs using this mechanism.  This
   style of usage is particularly useful only if one side is required to
   perform full reachability validations (ex: static route, uni-
   directional tunnel).  This style of usage is also particularly useful
   to perform validations and verifications on just subset of LSPs (ex:
   inter-AS, injection of partial BFD reachability validation packet on
   IPv4 RSVP LSP nodes).
