         <t>BCP 10 (RFC 3777) specifies IETF processes for selection,
            confirmation and recall of appointees to IETF positions. It also
            refers to the mechanism of resignation as part of a sequence that
            moves a sitting member to a new IETF position. However it does not
            more generally deal with vacancies created by resignation, death or
            uncontested, sustained absence from participation. This update to
            BCP 10 specifies procedures for handling vacancies.</t>

         <t>BCP 10 is modified as follows: <list
               style="symbols">
               <t>A new section is added, containing the text of the <xref
                     target="vacancy">Mid-Term Vacancy</xref> section,
                  below.</t>

      </section>

      <section
         anchor="vacancy"
         title="Mid-Term Vacancy">
         <t>The process of filling a mid-term vacancy is specified in Section 5
            of <xref
               target="RFC3777"></xref>(BCP10).</t>

         <section
            title="Definition">
            <t>A mid-term vacancy occurs in the IAB, IESG or IAOC when a sitting
               member of that body ceases to participate in its activities.
               Vacancy can occur due to death, resignation, or sustained
               absence.</t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Determination">
            <t>The IETF body of which the sitting member is a part will
               determine that the sitting member has vacated their position. In
               the case of vacancy due to uncontested, sustained absence, the
               body will make multiple different queries to the member, to
               determine the cause and likely duration of the absence. For a
               contested, sustained absence, the existing Member Recall process,
               as specified in Section 7 of <xref
                  target="RFC3777"></xref>, is required.</t>
            <t>A two-thirds majority vote of the IETF body is needed to
               determine that a vacancy exists.</t>
         </section>

         <section
            title="Confirmation">
            <t>For vacancies due to death or resignation, no further action is
               required, to declare the seat vacant.</t>
            <t>For vacancies due to uncontested, sustained absence, the IETF
               body making that determination will issue an Extended Last Call
               to the community. The Last Call will explain the basis for
               declaring the position vacant and include a summary of efforts to
               contact the member to resolve the issue. </t>
            <t>The results of the Last Call are assessed by the IETF body, with
               a two-thirds vote of the body. </t>
