                 ALTO Traffic Engineering Cost Metrics
                      draft-wu-alto-te-metrics-00

Abstract

   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
   Endpoint Cost Service.  Future extensions to ALTO may also use Cost
   Metric.

   Different applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics.  For
   example, a Resource Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that have
   low latency to the Resource Consumer.  However the base ALTO protocol
   [ALTO] has defined only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic
   "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).

   In this document, we define XXX Cost Metrics, derived from OSPF-TE
   and ISIS-TE, to measure network delay, jitter, packet loss, hop
   count, and bandwidth.  The metrics defined in this document provide a
   relatively comprehensive set of Cost Metrics for ALTO focusing on
   traffic engineering.  Additional Cost Metrics such as financial cost
   metrics may be defined in other documents.

1.  Introduction

   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
   Endpoint Cost Service.  In particular, applications may benefit from
   knowing network performance measured in several Cost Metrics.  For
   example, a more delay sensitive application may focus on latency, and
   a more bandwidth-sensitive application may focus on available
   bandwidth.

   In this document, we define X Cost Metrics, extending the base ALTO
   protocol [ALTO], which has defined only a single Cost Metric, i.e.,
   the generic "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base
   specification [ALTO]).

   The Cost Metrics that we define in this document focus on traffic
   engineering.  Additional metrics may be defined in other documents.
   In particular, the Cost Metrics that we define in this document can
   be gathered from routing systems; [OSPF-TE], [ISIS-TE], [BGP-LS] and
   [BGP-PM] define mechanisms that allow an ALTO Server to retrieve and
   derive the necessary information to provide the metrics that we
   define in this document.

   Note that the metrics that the ALTO Server retrieves may be defined
   for only links, and hence, the server will need to compose the link
   metrics to obtain path metrics used in services such as the Cost Map
   Service.  In this definition, we define the metrics to be independent
   of link or path, considering that future ALTO extensions may define
   link-based services, and hence the defined metrics should still be
   usable.

   One challenge in defining the metrics is that performance metrics
   often depend on configuration parameters.  For example, the value of
   packet loss rate depends on the measurement interval.  We handle this
   issue [YRY: IMPORTANT TO SOLVE]

   The definitions of a set Cost Metrics can allow us to extend the base
   protocol (e.g., allowing output and constraints use different Cost
   Metrics), but such extensions are not in the scope of this document.

           delay over the specified source and destination. The
           spatial aggregation unit is specified in the query context
           (e.g., PID to PID, or endhost to endhost); and the temporal
           unit is specified as the measurement interval.

 Metric Unit:  The unit is microseconds.

 Metric Value Type:
            A single 'JSONNumber' type value containing a non-negative
            integer component that may be followed by a fraction part
            and/or an exponent part.

4.  Metric: delayjitter

  Cost Metric name:  delayjitter

  Metric Description:   To specify the average delay variation over
            a configurable interval for each source/destination pair
            between two endpoints (network locations) in the network.
            It could be either end to end jitter or the jitter
            associated with a link (linkjitter). The unit is
            microseconds.

  Cost Metric Value type:
            A single 'JSONumber' type value containing an integer
            component that may be prefixed with an optional minus
            sign, which may be followed by a fraction part and/or
            an exponent part.

  Purpose: This is intended to be a constraint attribute value
  It could be used as a cost metric constraint attribute used
  together with cost metric attribute 'routingcost' or on its
  own or as a returned cost metric in the response.

  Cost mode:  A Cost Mode is encoded as a US-ASCII string.
  The string MUST either have the value 'numerical' or 'ordinal'.

  Measurement timing: Gather and update at the configurable interval
  if it is link attribute. See [OSPF-TE] for configurable
  interval. The configurable interval for end to end jitter could
  be same as link.

  Measurement points with Potential Measurement Domain:
  The measurement point could be at any endpoint between
  source and destination in the network.

8.  Metric: maxbw

   A maxbw is gathered using [RFC3630], [RFC3784] or [BGP-LS].  It could
   be either maximum bandwidth for end to end path or the bandwidth
   associated with a link.  It is extended from Bandwidth Cost metric
   and defined as:

 Object {
 BWType     max;
 [PIDName  srcPID;]
 [PIDName  dstPID;]
 [JSONBool state;] //TRUE = not steady for src/dst pair; FALSE = steady;
 Bandwidth bw;
 }maxbw;

   A maxreservbw is gathered using [RFC3630], [RFC3784] or [BGP-LS].  It
   could be either maximum reserved bandwidth for end to end path or the
   bandwidth associated with a link.  It is extended from Bandwidth Cost
   metric and defined as:

 Object {
 BWType     maxreserved;
 [PIDName  srcPID;]
 [PIDName  dstPID;]
 [JSONBool state;] //TRUE = not steady for src/dst pair; FALSE = steady;
 Bandwidth bw;
 }maxreservbw;

Appendix A.  Filtering constraint Extensions

   Section 10.2.2.3 of "ALTO: Application Layer Traffic Optimization
   Protocol" [I.D-ietf-alto-protocol] states:
   "
   object {
        CostType   cost-type;
        [JSONString constraints<0..*>;]
        [PIDFilter  pids;]
      } ReqFilteredCostMap;

   object {
        PIDName srcs<0..*>;
        PIDName dsts<0..*>;
      } PIDFilter;

   with members:

   cost-type  The CostType (Section 9.7) for the returned costs.  The
   cost-metric and cost-mode fields MUST match one of the supported
   Cost Types indicated in this resource's capabilities
   (Section 10.2.2.4).  The ALTO Client SHOULD omit the description
   field, and if present, the ALTO Server MUST ignore the description
   field.

   constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which
   elements of the Cost Map are returned.  This parameter MUST NOT be
   specified if this resource's capabilities ( Section 10.2.2.4)
   indicate that constraint support is not available.  A constraint
   contains two entities separated by whitespace: (1) an operator,
    'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for greater than
   or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for equal to;
   (2) a target cost value.  The cost value is a number that MUST be
   defined in the same units as the Cost Metric indicated by the
   cost-metric parameter.  ALTO Servers SHOULD use at least IEEE 754
   double-precision floating point [IEEE.754.2008] to store the cost
   value, and SHOULD perform internal computations using double-
   precision floating-point arithmetic.  If multiple 'constraint'
   parameters are specified, they are interpreted as being related to
   each other with a logical AND.
   "

   In the JSON Object of type ReqFilteredCostMap, the constraint
   attribute is expressed as:

   "
   [gt | lt | ge | le | eq ] <value>
   "

Internet-Draft               ALTO TE Metrics                October 2013


   In this specification, the constraint attribute is changed to

      "
   <cost-type2>  [gt | lt | ge | le | eq ] <value>
      "

   Accordingly, the constraints definition is changed to:

  "
  constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which
  elements of the Cost Map are returned.  This parameter MUST NOT be
  specified if this resource's capabilities ( Section 10.2.2.4)
  indicate that constraint support is not available.  A constraint
  contains three entities separated by whitespace: (1)an cost type
  is by default cost-type in the JSON Object of type ReqFilteredCostMap.
  In addition, it could be another cost-type used for the returned cost
  (2) an operator, 'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for
  greater than or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for
  equal to; (3) a target cost value.  The cost value is a number that
  MUST be defined in the same units as the Cost Metric indicated by the
  cost-metric parameter.  ALTO Servers SHOULD use at least IEEE 754
  double-precision floating point [IEEE.754.2008] to store the cost
  value, and SHOULD perform internal computations using double-
  precision floating-point arithmetic.  If multiple 'constraint'
  parameters are specified, they are interpreted as being related to
  each other with a logical AND.
  "

   Editor-Notes: Filtering constraint extension should move to another
   document defining multi-metrics filtering in the future.
