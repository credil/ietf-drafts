As a part of their deliverables, working groups of the IETF may
develop BEEP profiles.  During the development process, it is
desirable to assign a transient identifier to each profile.  If the
profile is subsequently published as an RFC, then a permanent
identifier is subsequently assigned by the IANA.

This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
