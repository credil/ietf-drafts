               Standard Representation Of Domain Sequence
                 draft-ietf-pce-pcep-domain-sequence-01

Abstract

   The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
   Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been
   identified as a key requirement for P2P and P2MP scenarios.  In this
   context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common
   sphere of address management or path computational responsibility
   such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems.  This document
   specifies a standard representation and encoding of a domain
   sequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains
   traversed to reach the destination domain.  This document also
   defines new sub-objects to be used to encode domain identifiers.

1.  Introduction

   A PCE may be used to compute end-to-end paths across multi-domain
   environments using a per-domain path computation technique [RFC5152].
   The so called backward recursive path computation (BRPC) mechanism
   [RFC5441] defines a PCE-based path computation procedure to compute
   inter-domain constrained (G)MPLS TE LSPs.  However, both per-domain
   and BRPC techniques assume that the sequence of domains to be crossed
   from source to destination is known, either fixed by the network
   operator or obtained by other means.  For inter-domain point-to-
   multi-point (P2MP) tree, [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] assumes the domain-
   tree is known.

   The list of domains in a point-to-point (P2P) path or a point-to-
   multi-point (P2MP) tree is usually a constraint in the path
   computation request.  The PCE decouples the domain to determine the
   next PCE to forward the request.

   According to BRPC mechanism the PCC MAY indicate the sequence of
   domains to be traversed using the Include Route Object (IRO) defined
   in [RFC5440].

   This document proposes a standard way to represent and encode a
   domain sequence using IRO in various deployment scenarios including
   P2P, P2MP and Hierarchical PCE (HPCE) [PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK].

   The domain sequence (the set of domains traversed to reach the
   destination domain) is either administratively predetermined or
   discovered by some means (H-PCE) that is outside of the scope of this
   document.  Here the focus is only on a standard representation of the
   domain sequence in all possible scenarios.

3.  Detail Description

3.1.  Domains

   A domain can be defined as a separate administrative or geographic
   environment within the network.  A domain may be further defined as a
   zone of routing or computational ability.  Under these definitions a
   domain might be categorized as an Autonomous System (AS) or an
   Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area ( as per [RFC4726] and
   [RFC4655]).  To uniquely identify a domain in the domain sequence
   both AS and Area-id MAYBE important.

3.2.  Domain-Sequence

   A domain-sequence is an ordered sequence of domains traversed to
   reach the destination domain.  In this context a Domain could be an
   Autonomous System (AS) or an IGP Area.  Note that an AS can be
   further made of multiple Areas.

   Domain Sequence can be applied as a constraint and carried in path
   computation request to PCE(s).  In case of HPCE [PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK]
   Parent PCE MAY send the domain sequence as a result in path
   computation reply.

   In this context, ordered sequence is important, in a P2P path, the
   domains listed appear in the order that they are crossed.  In a P2MP
   path, the domain tree is represented as list of domain sequences.

   One main goal of the Domain-Sequence is to enable a PCE to select the
   next PCE to forward the path computation request based on the domain
   information.

   A PCC or PCE MAY add an additional constraints covering which
   Boundary Nodes (ABR or ASBR) or Border links (Inter-AS-link) MUST be
   traversed while defining a domain sequence.

   Thus a Domain-Sequence MAY be made up of one or more of -

   o  AS Number

   o  Area ID

   o  Boundary Node ID

   o  Inter-AS-Link Address

   Consequently, a Domain-Sequence can be used:

   1.  by a PCE in order to discover or select the next PCE in a
       collaborative path computation, such as in BRPC [RFC5441];

   2.  by the Parent PCE to return the domain sequence when unknown,
       this can further be an input to BRPC procedure;

   3.  By a PCC (or PCE) to constraint the domains used in a H-PCE path
       computation, explicitly specifying which domains to be expanded;

3.3.  Standard Representation

3.3.1.  New Sub-Objects

   Some sub-objects are defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473], [RFC3477] and
   [RFC4874], but new sub-objects related to Domain-Sequence are needed.

3.3.1.1.  Autonomous system

   [RFC3209] already defines 2 octet AS number.

   To support 4 octet AS number as per [RFC4893] following subobject is
   defined:


       0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   L: The L bit is an attribute of the subobject as define in [RFC3209].

   Type: (TBA by IANA) indicating 4 octet AS Number.

   Length: 8 (Total length of the subobject in bytes).

   Reserved: Zero at transmission, Ignored at receipt.

   AS-ID: The 4 octet AS Number.  Note that if 16-bit AS numbers are in
   use, the low order bits (16 through 31) should be used and the high
   order bits (0 through 15) should be set to zero.

3.3.1.2.  IGP Area

   Since the length and format of Area-id is different for OSPF and
   ISIS, following two subobjects are defined:

   For OSPF, the area-id is a 32 bit number. The Subobject looks
       0                   1                   2                   3

   L: The L bit is an attribute of the subobject as define in [RFC3209].

   Type: (TBA by IANA) indicating 4 octet OSPF Area ID.

   Length: 8 (Total length of the subobject in bytes).

   Reserved: Zero at transmission, Ignored at receipt.

   OSPF Area Id: The 4 octet OSPF Area ID.

   For IS-IS, the area-id is of variable length and thus the length of
   the Subobject is variable.  The Area-id is as described in IS-IS by
   ISO standard [ISO 10589].

       0                   1                   2                   3

   L: The L bit is an attribute of the subobject as define in [RFC3209].

   Type: (TBA by IANA) indicating IS-IS Area ID.

   Length: Variable (Total length of the subobject in bytes including
   padding).  The Length MUST be at least 4, and MUST be a multiple of
   4.

   Area-Len: Variable (Length of the actual (non-padded) IS-IS Area
   Identifier in octets; Valid values are from 2 to 11 inclusive).

   IS-IS Area Id: The variable-length IS-IS area identifier.  Padded
   with trailing zeroes to a four-octet boundary.

3.3.2.  Use in PCEP Objects

   These sub-objects MAYBE used in -

   o  Include Route Object (IRO): As per [RFC5440], used to specify set
      of network elements that MUST be traversed.  These subobjects are
      used to specify the domain-sequence that MUST be traversed to
      reach the destination.

   o  Exclude Route Object (XRO): As per [RFC5521], used to specify
      certain abstract nodes that MUST be excluded from whole path.
      These subobjects are used to specify certain domains that MUST be
      avoided to reach the destination.

   o  Explicit Route Object (ERO): As per [RFC5440],used to specify a
      computed path in the network.  These subobjects are used to
      specify the domain-sequence when computed by a Parent PCE
      ([PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK]).

   o  Explicit Exclusion Route Sub-Object (EXRS): As per [RFC5521], used
      to specify exclusion of certain abstract nodes between a specific
      pair of nodes.  EXRS are a sub-object inside the IRO.  These
      subobjects are used to specify the domains that must be excluded
      between two abstract nodes.

3.3.2.1.  Include Route Object

3.3.2.1.1.  Option 1: New IRO Object Type

   The IRO (Include Route Object) [RFC5440] is an optional object used
   to specify a set of specified network elements that the computed path
   MUST traverse.  [RFC5440] in its description of IRO does not
   constrain the sub-objects to be in a given particular order.  When
   considering a domain sequence, the domain relative ordering is a
   basic criterion and, as such, this document specifies a new IRO
   object type.

   Sub-objects: The IRO is made of sub-objects identical to the ones
   defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473], and [RFC3477], where the IRO sub-
   object type is identical to the sub-object type defined in the
   related documents.  Some new sub-objects related to Domain-Sequence
   are also added in this document.


   The following sub-object types are used.
                Type   Sub-object
                 1     IPv4 prefix
                 2     IPv6 prefix

                 TBD   OSPF Area id
                 TBD   ISIS Area id

   [RFC3209] defines sub-objects for IPv4, IPv6 and unnumbered Interface
   ID, which in the context of domain-sequence is used to specify
   Boundary Node (ABR/ASBR) and Inter-AS-Links.  The sub-objects for AS
   Number (2 or 4 Byte) and IGP Area is used to specify the domains in
   the domain-sequence.

   The new IRO Object-Type used to define the domain-sequence would
   handle the L bit (Loose / Strict) in the sub-objects.

   Note that PCReq message is free to carry both type of IRO with IRO
   Type 1 ([RFC5440]) used to specify the intra-domain abstract nodes
   and resources and the new IRO Type as described in this document to
   specify the domain-sequence.

   All other rules of PCEP objects and message processing (ex.  P bit
   handling of Common Object Header) is as per [RFC5440].

3.3.2.1.1.1.  Mode of Operation

   A domain sequence IRO object constraints or defines the domains
   involved in a multi-domain path computation, typically involving two
   or more collaborative PCEs.

   A domain sequence can have varying degrees on granularity; it is
   possible to have a domain sequence composed of, uniquely, AS
   identifiers.  It is also possible to list the involved areas for a
   given AS.

   In any case, the mapping between domains and responsible PCEs is not
   defined in this document.  It is assumed that a PCE that needs to
   obtain a "next PCE" from a domain sequence is able to do so (e.g. via
   administrative configuration, or discovery).

   A PCC builds a domain sequence IRO (new type) to encode the domain
   sequence, that is all domains that it wishes the cooperating PCEs to
   traverse in order to compute the end to end path.

   For each inclusion, the PCC clears the L-bit to indicate that the PCE
   is required to include the domain, or sets the L-bit to indicate that
   the PCC simply desires that the domain be included in the domain-
   sequence.

   When a PCE receives a PCReq message it looks for a domain sequence
   IRO (new type) to see if domain-sequence are required.  If the PCE
   finds more than one domain sequence IRO (new type), it MUST use the
   first one in the message and MUST ignore subsequent instances.

   If the PCE does not recognize the domain sequence IRO (new type), it
   MUST return a PCErr message with Error-Type "Unknown Object" and
   Error-value "Unrecognized object Type" as described in [RFC5440].

   If the PCE is unwilling or unable to process the domain sequence IRO
   (new type), it MUST return a PCErr message with the Error-Type "Not
   supported object" and follow the relevant procedures described in
   [RFC5440].

   If a PCE that supports the domain sequence IRO (new type) and
   encounters a subobject that it does not support or recognize, it MUST
   act according to the setting of the L-bit in the subobject.  If the
   L-bit is clear, the PCE MUST respond with a PCErr with Error-Type
   "Unrecognized subobject" and set the Error-Value to the subobject
   type code.  If the L-bit is set, the PCE MAY respond with a PCErr as
   already stated or MAY ignore the subobject: this choice is a local
   policy decision.

Internet-Draft                 DOMAIN SEQ                      July 2012


   If a PCE parses a domain sequence IRO (new type) and encounters these
   subobject that it recognizes, it MUST act according to the
   requirements expressed in the subobject.  That is, if the L-bit is
   clear, the PCE(s) MUST produce a path that follows domain-sequence
   nodes in order identified by the sub-objects in the path.  If the
   L-bit is set, the PCE(s) SHOULD produce a path along the domain
   sequence unless it is not possible to construct a path complying with
   the other constraints expressed in the PCReq message.

   A successful path computation reported in a PCRep message MUST
   include an ERO to specify the path that has been computed as
   specified in [RFC5440] following the domain-sequence.

   When a PCE returns a path in a PCRep, it MAY also supply a domain
   sequence IRO (new type) in a PCRep message with the NO-PATH object
   indicates that the set of elements of the original domain sequence
   IRO prevented the PCE from finding a path.

   Sub-Object types for AS and IGP Area guide the next domain selection
   and finding the PCE serving that domain.

   Note that a particular domain in the domain-sequence can be
   identified by -

   o  Just Area: Only the IGP (OSPF or ISIS) Area subobject is used to
      identify the next domain.  (Refer Figure 1)

   o  Just AS: Only the AS subobject is used to identify the next
      domain.  (Refer Figure 2)

   o  AS and IGP Area: Combination of both AS and Area are used to
      identify the next domain.  In this case the order is AS Subobject
      followed by Area.  (Refer Figure 3)

   Sub-Object of other types representing Boundary Node or Inter-As-Link
   do not pay any role in selection of next domain and subsequently PCE
   selection in the domain-sequence.  But they MUST be applied during
   the final path computation procedure as before.

3.3.2.1.2.  Option 2: Same IRO Object Type

   The IRO (Include Route Object) [RFC5440] is an optional object used
   to specify a set of specified network elements that the computed path
   MUST traverse.

   The new sub-objects denoting the domain-sequence is carried in the
   same IRO Type 1, and all the rules of processing as specified in
   [RFC5440] are applied.

Internet-Draft                 DOMAIN SEQ                      July 2012


   Note the following differences -

   o  Order: Since there is no inherent order specified in the encoding
      of the subobjects in IRO Type 1 [RFC5440].  It is the job of PCE
      to figure out the order of the domains to be crossed to reach the
      destination domain.  Note that in case of doubt, or when
      applicable, PCE can still apply the ordering as specified in the
      PCReq message.

   o  Loose / Strict: [RFC5440] state that the L bit of the sub-objects
      within an IRO Type 1 [RFC5440] has no meaning.  This is applicable
      for sub-objects denoting domain-sequence as well.

   o  Scope: Sub-objects referring to domains and boundary nodes will
      mix with subobjects for internal network nodes of multiple
      domains.  It is the job of PCE to figure out the scope and apply
      the processing rules accordingly.  The PCE should distinguish
      between - the subobject is unknown (not in TED) or known but the
      computation fails.  The PCE processing the IRO MAY include as many
      of the elements of the IRO as possible.  If the PCE is passing the
      request onwards, it is OK for it to have unknown nodes, and it can
      assume that the next PCE might be able to satisfy the remaining
      elements of the IRO.  On the other hand, if the PCE is making an
      end-to-end (or edge-to-edge, or end-to-edge) path and will return
      the response to a PCC (rather than pass it on) then the PCE must
      fail if it cannot satisfy the IRO.  Ultimately, when the path
      segments are aggregated by a head-end PCE or by a parent PCE, that
      PCE can check to see whether any elements of the IRO are still
      missing and handle accordiangly.

3.3.2.2.  Exclude Route Object

   The Exclude Route Object (XRO) [RFC5521] is an optional object used
   to specify exclusion of certain abstract nodes or resources from the
   whole path.

   The following subobject types are defined to be used in XRO as
   defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3477], [RFC4874], and [RFC5521].

   MAY also be used in the XRO to specify exclusion of certain domains

   The X-bit indicates whether the exclusion is mandatory or desired. 0
   indicates that the domain specified MUST be excluded from the path
   computed by the PCE(s). 1 indicates that the domain specified SHOULD
   be excluded from the inter-domain path computed by the PCE(s), but
   MAY be included subject to PCE policy and the absence of a viable
   path that meets the other constraints and excludes the domain.  All
   other fields are consistent with the definition in Section 3.3.1.

   If a PCE that supports XRO and encounters a subobject that it does

3.3.2.3.  Explicit Route Object

   The Explicit Route Object (ERO) [RFC5440] is used to specify a
   computed path in the network.  PCEP ERO sub-object types correspond
   to RSVP-TE ERO sub-object types as defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473],
   [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], and [RFC5520].

                 TBD   ISIS Area id

   The new subobjects to support 4 octet AS and IGP (OSPF / ISIS) Area
   MAY also be used in the ERO to specify an abstract node (a group of
   nodes whose internal topology is opaque to the ingress node of the
   LSP).  Using this concept of abstraction, an explicitly routed LSP
   can be specified as a sequence of domains.

   In case of Hierarchical PCE, a Parent PCE ([PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK]) MAY
   be requested to find the domain-sequence.  The Parent PCE MUST use
   ERO with AS and IGP Area subobjects to encode the computed domain-
   sequence.  Refer example in Section 3.4.6.

3.3.2.4.  Explicit Exclusion Route Sub-Object

   Explicit Exclusion Route Sub-Object (EXRS) [RFC5521] is used to
   specify exclusion of certain abstract nodes between a specific pair
   of nodes.

   The EXRS subobject may carry any of the subobjects defined for
   inclusion in the XRO, thus the new subobjects to support 4 octet AS
   and IGP (OSPF / ISIS) Area MAY also be used in the EXRS.  The
   meanings of the fields of the new XRO subobjects are unchanged when
   the subobjects are included in an EXRS, except that scope of the
   exclusion is limited to the single hop between the previous and
   subsequent elements in the IRO.

   All the processing rules are as per [RFC5521].

3.4.  Other Considerations

3.4.1.  Inter-Area Path Computation

   In an inter-area path computation where ingress and egress belong to
   different IGP area, the domain sequence MAYBE represented using a
   ordered list of AREA sub-objects.  AS number MAYBE skipped, as area
   information is enough to select the next PCE.

   AS is optional and it MAY be skipped.  PCE should be able to
   understand both notations.

3.4.2.  Inter-AS Path Computation

   In inter-AS path computation, where ingress and egress belong to
   different AS, the domain sequence is represented using an ordered
   list of AS sub-objects.  The domain sequence MAY further include
   decomposed area information in AREA sub-objects.

3.4.2.1.  Example 1

   As shown in Figure 2, where AS to be made of a single area, the area
   subobject MAY be skipped in the domain sequence as AS is enough to
   uniquely identify the next domain and PCE.

Combination of both AS and Area uniquely identify a domain in the domain
sequence.

   Note that an Area domain identifier always belongs to the previous AS
   that appear before it or, if no AS sub-objects are present, it is
   assumed to be the current AS.

   If the area information cannot be provided, PCE MAY forward the path
   computation request to the next PCE based on AS only.  If multiple
   PCEs of different area domain exist, PCE MAY apply local policy to
   select the next PCE.  Furthermore the domain sequence (list of areas
   within AS) in the next PCE MAYBE pre-administered or MAYBE discovered
   via some mechanism (ex.  HPCE).

3.4.3.  Boundary Node and Inter-AS-Link

   A PCC or PCE MAY add additional constraints covering which Boundary
   Nodes (ABR or ASBR) or Border links (Inter-AS-link) MUST be traversed
   while defining a domain sequence.  In which case the Boundary Node or
   Link MAY be encoded as a part of the domain-sequence using the
   existing sub-objects.

   Boundary Node (ABR / ASBR) can be encoded using the IPv4 or IPv6
   prefix sub-objects.  The Inter-AS link can be encoded using the IPv4
   or IPv6 prefix or unnumbered interface sub-objects.

   For Figure 1, an ABR to be traversed can be specified as:

          +---------+  +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ +---------+

3.4.4.  PCE serving multiple domains

   A single PCE MAYBE responsible for multiple domains; for example PCE
   function deployed on an ABR.  Domain sequence should have no impact
   on this.  PCE which can support 2 adjacent domains can internally
   handle this situation without any impact on the neighboring domains.

3.4.5.  P2MP

   In case of inter-domain P2MP path computation, (Refer
   [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES]) the path domain tree is nothing but a series
   of Domain Sequences, as shown in the below figure:

      D1-D3-D6, D1-D3-D5 and D1-D2-D4.
                  D1
                 /  \
                D2  D3
               /   /  \
              D4  D5  D6

   All rules of processing as applied to P2P can be applied to P2MP as
   well.

   In case of P2MP, different destinations MAY have different domain
   sequence within the domain tree, it requires domain-sequence to be
   attached per destination.  (Refer [PCE-P2MP-PER-DEST])

3.4.6.  HPCE

   As per [PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK], consider a case as shown in Figure 4
   consisting of multiple child PCEs and a parent PCE.

   parent PCE to determine the domain sequence and return in the path
   computation reply message (PCRep), using the ERO Object.  The ERO can
   contain an ordered sequence of sub-object such as AS and Area (OSPF/
   ISIS).  In this case, the PCRep would carry the domain sequence
   result as:

     |Header   | |100      | |Area 2   | |Area 0   | |Area 4   |
     |         | |         | |         | |         | |         |

     +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ +---------+ +---------+

   Note that, in the case of ERO objects, no new PCEP object type is
   required since the ordering constraint is assumed.

3.4.7.  Relationship to PCE Sequence

   [RFC5886] and [PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES] along with Domain Sequence
   introduces the concept of PCE-Sequence, where a sequence of PCEs,
   based on the domain sequence, should be decided and attached in the
   PCReq at the very beginning of path computation.

   An alternative would be to use domain sequences, note that PCE-
   Sequence can be used along with domain-sequence in which case PCE-
   Sequence SHOULD have higher precedence in selecting the next PCE in
   the inter-domain path computation procedures.  Note that Domain-
   Sequence IRO constraints should still be checked as per the rules of
   processing IRO.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  PCEP Objects

   The "PCEP Parameters" registry contains a subregistry "PCEP Objects".
   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from this

                       (TBA): Domain Sequence [This I.D.]

4.2.  New Sub-Objects

   The "PCEP Parameters" registry contains a subregistry "PCEP Objects"
   with an entry for the Include Route Object (IRO) and Exclude Route
   Object (XRO).  IANA is requested to add further subobjects as
   follows:


       Subobject Type                          Reference
       TBA       4 octet AS number             [This I.D.]
       TBA       OSPF Area ID                  [This I.D.]
       TBA       IS-IS Area ID                 [This I.D.]

4.3.  Error Object Field Values

   The "PCEP Parameters" registry contains a subregistry "Error Types
   and Values".  IANA is requested to make the following allocations
   from this subregistry


       ERROR     Meaning                       Reference
       Type
       TBA       "Unrecognized subobject"      [This I.D.]
                 Error-Value: type code

5.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a standard representation of domain sequence,
   which MAYBE used in inter-domain PCE scenarios as explained in other
   RFC and drafts.  The new sub-objects and domain sequence mechanisms
   defined in this document allow finer and more specific control of the
   path computed by a cooperating PCE(s).  Such control increases the
   risk if a PCEP message is intercepted, modified, or spoofed because
   it allows the attacker to exert control over the path that the PCE
   will compute or to make the path computation impossible.  Therefore,
   the security techniques described in [RFC5440] are considered more
   important.

   Note, however, that the domain sequence mechanisms also provide the

   operator with the ability to route around vulnerable parts of the
   network and may be used to increase overall network security.

6.  Manageability Considerations

6.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   Several local policy decisions should be made at the PCE.  Firstly,
   the exact behavior with regard to desired inclusion and exclusion of
   domains must be available for examination by an operator and may be
   configurable.  Second, the behavior on receipt of an unrecognized
   sub-objects with the L or X-bit set should be configurable and must
   be available for inspection.  The inspection and control of these
   local policy choices may be part of the PCEP MIB module.

6.2.  Information and Data Models

   A MIB module for management of the PCEP is being specified in a
   separate document [PCEP-MIB].  That MIB module allows examination of
   individual PCEP messages, in particular requests, responses and
   errors.  The MIB module MUST be extended to include the ability to
   view the domain-sequence extensions defined in this document.

6.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

6.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440].

6.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   The Sub-objects defined in this document SHOULD be supported by RSVP
   especially for per-domain path computation [RFC5152] where the
   domains need to encoded in the RSVP messages.

   Apart from this, mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any
   requirements on other protocols in addition to those already listed
   in [RFC5440].

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440].
