1.  Introduction

   [RFC7001] specifies the Authentication-Results header field for
   conveying results of message authentication checks.  As S/MIME
   signature verification (and alteration) is sometimes implemented in
   border message transfer agents, guards and gateways (for example see
   [RFC3183]), there is a need to convey signature verification status
   to Mail User Agents (MUA) and downstream filters.  This document
   defines a new authentication method to be used in the Authentication-
   Results header field for S/MIME related signature checks.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation including the core rules defined in Appendix B of
   RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

3.  "smime" Authentication Method

   S/MIME signature and countersignature verification is represented by
   the "smime" method and is defined in [RFC5751].

3.1.  S/MIME Results

   The result values used by S/MIME [RFC5751] are as follows:

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | Result code | Meaning                                             |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | none        | The message was not signed.                         |

   |             | CRL.  A later attempt may produce a final result.   |

   |             | being available.  A later attempt is unlikely to    |
   |             | produce a final result.                             |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+


   A signature is "acceptable to the verifier" if it passes local policy
   checks (or there are no specific local policy checks).  For example,
   a verifier might require that the domain in the rfc822Name
   subjectAltName in the signing certificate matches the domain in the
   address of the sender of the message, thus making third-party
   signatures unacceptable.  [RFC5751] advises that if a message fails
   verification, it should be treated as an unsigned message.  A report
   of "fail" here permits the receiver of the report to decide how to
   handle the failure.  A report of "neutral" or "none" preempts that
   choice, ensuring the message will be treated as if it had not been
   signed.

Internet-DraftAuthentication-Results Registration for S/MIMNovember 2013


   This document doesn't add new security considerations not already
   covered by [RFC7001] and [RFC5751].  In particular security
   considerations related to use of weak cryptography over plaintext,
   weakening and breaking of cryptographic algorithms over time, as well
   as changing the behavior of message processing based on presence of a
   signature specified in [RFC5751] are relevant to this document.
   Similarly, the following security considerations specified in
   [RFC7001] are particularly relevant to this document: Forged Header
   Fields, Misleading Results, Internal MTA Lists and Compromised
   Internal Hosts.

   Note that agents adding Authentication-Results header fields
   containing S/MIME Authentication Method might be unable to verify
   S/MIME signatures inside encrypted CMS content types such as
   EnvelopedData [RFC5652] .  So agents processing Authentication-
   Results header fields shouldn't treat lack of an Authentication-
   Results header field with S/MIME Authentication Method as an
   indication that the corresponding S/MIME signature is missing or
   invalid.
