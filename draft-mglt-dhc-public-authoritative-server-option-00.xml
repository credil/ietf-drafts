        <t>The home network naming architecture as described in <xref target="I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation"/> requires a complex naming configuration on the CPE. This configuration MAY not be handled easily by the average end user. Furthermore, such misconfiguration MAY result in making home network unreachable.</t>

        <t>This document proposes a DHCP option that provides the CPE all necessary parameters to set up the home network naming architecture.</t>
      
        <t>First, this DHCP option provides automatic configuration and avoids most end users' misconfigurations. Most average end users may not require specific configuration, and their ISP default configuration MAY fully  address their needs. In that case, the naming homenet architecture configuration will be completely transparent to the end users. Then, saving naming configuration outside the CPE, makes it resilient to change of CPE or CPE upgrades. Such configuration may also be configured by the end user, via the customer area of their ISP.</t>

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>With IPv6, nodes inside the home network are expected to be globally reachable. CPEs are already providing connectivity to the home network, and most of the time already assigns IP addresses to the nodes of the home network using for example DHCPv6.</t>
             <t>This makes CPE good candidate for defining the DNS zone file of the home network. However, CPEs have not been designed to handle heavy traffic, nor heavy operations. As a consequence, CPE SHOULD neither host the authoritative naming service of the home network, nor handle DNSSEC operations such as zone signing. In addition, CPE are usually managed by end users, and the  average end user is most likely not mastering DNSSEC to administrate its DNSSEC zone. As a result, CPE SHOULD outsource both the naming authoritative service and its DNSSEC management operations to a third party. This architecture, designated as the homenet naming architecture is described in <xref target="I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation"/>, and the third party is designated as the Public Authoritative Servers.</t> 

            <t>The home network naming architecture defines how the CPE and the Public Authoritative Servers interact together, so to leverage some of the issues related to the CPE, and the DNSSEC understanding of the average end user. Even though most of the DNSSEC issues are outsourced to the Public Authoritative Servers, setting the homenet naming architecture still requires some configurations.</t>

            <t>Configuration is fine as it provides the opportunity for advanced end users to make the naming architecture fit their specific needs. However most of the end users do not want to configure the homenet naming architecture. In most cases, the end users wants to subscribe and plug its CPE. The CPE is expected to be configured to set automatically and transparently the appropriated home network naming architecture.</t>

            <t>Using DHCP options to provide the necessary parameters for setting the homenet naming architecture provides multiple advantages. Firstly, it makes the network configuration independent of the CPE. Any new plugged CPE configures itself according to the provided configuration parameters. Secondly, it saves the configuration outside the CPE, which prevents re-configuring the CPE when it is replaced or reset. Finally ISPs are likely to propose a default homenet naming architecture that may address most of the end users needs. For these end users, no configuration will be performed at any time. This avoids unnecessary configurations or misconfiguration that could result in isolating the home network. For more advanced end users, the configuration MAY be provided also via the web GUI of the ISP's customer area for example. This configuration MAY enable third party Public Authoritative Servers. By doing so, these end users will also benefit from CPE-indepedent configuration and configuration backup.</t>  

<t>This document considers the architecture described in <xref target="I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation"/>. The DNS(SEC) zone related to the home network is configured and set by the CPE and hosted on a Public Authoritative Server. <xref target="I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation"/> describes how the synchronization between the CPE and the Public Authoritative Server is performed. This document describes the DNS Public Authoritative Server DHCP option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER) that provides the necessary parameters to the CPE to set the architecture described in <xref target="I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation"/>.</t>

<t><xref target="sec-overview"/> presents an overview of the DNS Public Authoritative Server DHCP option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER) and <xref target="sec-format"/> describes the format of this option and <xref target="sec-exchange"/> details the exchange between the CPE and the DHCPv6 Server.</t>

<t>This document assumes the reader is familiar with <xref target="I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation"/>.</t>
 
<t>This document assumes that the communication between the CPE and the ISP DHCP Server is protected. This document does not specify which mechanism should be used. <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> proposes a DHCP authentication and message exchange protection, <xref target="RFC4301"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5996"></xref> proposes to secure the channel at the IP layer.</t>

<t>This document only deals with IPv6 IP addresses and DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>. When we mention DHCP, it MUST be understood as DHCPv6.</t>


        </section>

        <section anchor="sec-overview" title="Protocol Overview">

        <t>The CPE requests the necessary parameters to set its home network naming configuration to the DHCP server. The DHCP server MAY be, for example, the one of its ISP, that already provides the IPv6 prefix to the CPE.</t>

        <t>The CPE sends an Option Request DHCP Option (ORO) <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> for the DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER)</t>

        <t>If available, the DHCP server sends back one or more DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER), depending if the end user has registered to one or multiple Public Authoritative Servers.</t>

        <t>A CPE MAY be associated to one or multiple  Registered Homenet Domain and one or multiple Public Authoritative Servers. The CPE builds a zone for each  Registered Homenet Domain. These zones are uploaded / synchronized with their associated Public Authoritative Servers. Note that synchronization is performed through master / slave configuration of the DNS servers, thus Public Authoritative Servers are configured to host specific  Registered Homenet Domains. On the other hand, a given Homenet Zone MAY be hosted by multiple Public Authoritative Servers. The CPE MUST build properly the DNS Homenet Zone and synchronize properly the hidden master and slaves for the synchronizations.</t>

        <t>In order to configure properly the DNS Homenet Zone, the CPE SHOULD collect the list of  Registered Homenet Domain and their associated Public Authoritative Servers. For each  Registered Homenet Domain, the CPE lists the Public Authoritative Servers FQDN and set them as authoritative Name Server (RRset NS) for the zone. The CPE MAY also add in the DNS Homenet Zone their IP addresses (RRsets A or AAAA). This FQDN and IP addresses associated are designated as the Public Authoritative Master(s).</t>

        <t> Note that how the CPE manage the multiple DNS Homenet Zones is implementation dependent. It MAY synchronize all DNS Homenet Zone with the Public Authoritative Servers, or use zone redirection mechanisms like like CNAME <xref target="RFC2181"/>, <xref target="RFC1034"/>, DNAME <xref target="RFC6672"/> or CNAME+DNAME <xref target="I-D.sury-dnsext-cname-dname"/>. In the first case, any update requires to update all zone, whereas redirection MAY require only updating a single DNS Homenet Zone.</t>

        <t>In order to synchronize the DNS Homenet Zone with a Public Authoritative Server, the CPE needs to know how to establish a secure channel with the Public Authoritative Server. The Public Authoritative Server MAY have dedicated servers working as slave to synchronize the DNS Homenet Zone with the CPE. These servers are called Public Authoritative Name Server Set. In addition to these servers, the CPE MUST know which security protocol can be used to secure the channel as well as the security credential. In this document, we only considered Pre-Shared Key (PSK).</t> 

 
        <t>As a result, the DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option (DNS_PUBLIC_AUTHORITATIVE_SERVER) carries:

                    <t hangText="-  Registered Homenet Domain List:">the list of  Registered Homenet Domain the Public Authoritative Server hosts.</t>
                    <t hangText="- Master :">the Public Authoritative Master(s), that is to say the FQDNs provided in the NS RRsets of the Homenet Zones associated to each of the Registered Homenet Domains. IP addresses are derived by the CPE thanks to a DNS(SEC) resolutions.</t>
                    <t hangText="- Secure Channel:">the Public Authoritative Name Server Set , that is the FQDN the CPE MUST securely synchronize its DNS Homenet Zone with. This field MUST also specify, the security protocol as well as the security material.</t>

        <t>If the DHCPv6 Server does not understand the DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option, it ignores the Option as specified in <xref target="RFC3315"/>.</t>

        <t>If the DHCPv6 has no specific configuration, it MUST return a DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option with the len registered-domain-list-len, master-list-len and secure-channel-list-len set to zero. This response is called the Zero Response and indicates that there are not enough arguments to set the home network architecture.</t>

        <t>The registered-domain-list is mandatory. If it does not exists, and Zero Response MUST be sent.</t>
        <t>A zero length for master-list indicates the CPE hosts the zone. In this case, a zero length secure-channel-list is expected.</t>

    <section title="DNSSEC is recommended to authenticate DNS hosted data">
    <t>The document describes how the Secure Delegation can be set between the Delegating DNS Server and the Delegated DNS Server.</t>

    <t>Deploying DNSSEC is recommended since in some cases the information stored in the DNS is used by the ISP or an IT department to grant access. For example some Servers may performed a PTR DNS query to grant access based on host names. With the described Delegating Naming Architecture, the ISP or the IT department MUST take into consideration that the CPE is outside its area of control. As such, with DNS, DNS responses may be forged, resulting in isolating a Service, or not enabling a host to access a service. ISPs or IT department may not base their access policies on PTR or any DNS information. DNSSEC fulfills the DNS lack of trust, and we recommend to deploy DNSSEC on CPEs.</t>     
    </section>


    <section title="Channel between the CPE and ISP DHCP Server MUST be secured">
    <t>In the document we consider that the channel between the CPE and the ISP DHCP Server is trusted. More specifically, we suppose the CPE is authenticated and the exchanged messages are protected. The current document does not specify how to secure the channel.  <xref target="RFC3315"/> proposes a DHCP authentication and message exchange protection, <xref target="RFC4301"/>, <xref target="RFC5996"/> propose to secure the channel at the IP layer.</t> 
    <t>In fact, the channel MUST be secured because the CPE provides necessary information for the configuration of the Naming Delegation. Unsecured channel may result in setting the Naming Delegation with an non legitimate CPE. The non legitimate CPE would then be redirected the DNS traffic that is intended for the legitimate CPE. This makes the CPE sensitive to three types of attacks. The first one is the Deny Of Service Attack, if for example DNS traffic for a lot of CPEs are redirected to a single CPE. CPE are even more sensitive to this attack since they have been designed for low traffic. The other type of traffic is the DNS traffic hijacking. A malicious CPE may redirect the DNS traffic of the legitimate CPE to one of its server. In return, the DNS Servers would be able to provide DNS Responses and redirect the End Users on malicious Servers. This is particularly used in Pharming Attacks. A third attack may consists in isolating a Home Network by misconfiguring the Naming Delegation for example to a non-existing DNS Server, or with a bad DS value.</t>
    </section>

   <section title="CPEs are sensitive to DoS"> 
<t>The Naming Delegation Architecture involves the CPE that hosts a DNS Server for the Home Network. CPE have not been designed for handling heavy load.  The CPE are exposed on the Internet, and their IP address is publicly published on the Internet via the DNS. This makes the Home Network  sensitive to Deny of Service Attacks. The Naming Delegation Architecture described in this document does not address this issue. The issue is addressed by <xref target="I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation"/>.</t>
