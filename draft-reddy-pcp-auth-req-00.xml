    <abstract>
      <t>In an attempt to reach consensus on a PCP authentication mechanism,
      this document describes requirements for PCP authentication. It is hoped
      this can serve as the basis for a comparison of PCP authentication
      mechanisms.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document derives requirements for PCP Authentication from PCP
      deployment scenarios and scope described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base">PCP-base</xref> and other PCP drafts. The
      document focuses on requirements and does not make a suggestion on the
      authentication mechanism to be used to satisfy requirements.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="REQ-1:">PCP client and server MUST provide client
          authentication. The client could be a host running a PCP client or
          middle box (e.g., NAT) running a PCP Proxy. <list style="symbols">
              <t>The identity details of the client could be used by the PCP
              server to grant access to certain PCP opcodes or PCP options.
              For example GUESTS would not be permitted to use MAP opcode,
              ADMINISTRATOR is only permitted to use THIRD_PARTY option.</t>

              <t>The identity details of the client could be used for
              auditing.</t>
            </list>PCP Authentication MUST also generate message
          authentication key for integrity protection of PCP request and
          response.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-2:">PCP Servers MUST be able to indicate that a
          request will not be processed without authentication.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-3:">PCP allows a server to send multiple responses.
          To properly support that model with authentication, a client that
          sends an authenticated request MUST be able to verify the integrity
          and origin of an subsequent unsolicited response should it choose to
          do so.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-4:">PCP allows a server to send multiple responses.
          If the original request/response exchange was authenticated, a
          server MUST be able to send a subsequent authenticated unsolicited
          Response.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-5:">PCP allows a server to send multiple responses.
          If the server wants to send an unsolicited message, but the previous
          security association has expired, the server MUST be able to trigger
          re-authentication with the client.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-6:">Clients that have authenticated with the server
          MUST verify the integrity of the contents of all unsolicited
          responses.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-7:">If there are circumstances where PCP responses
          do not include integrity related to a current security association,
          then those messages MUST NOT be trusted without soliciting an
          integrity protected version.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-8:">It is important that PCP not leak privacy
          information between the PCP client and the PCP server(s). Thus, the
          PCP authentication MUST NOT exchange the PCP clients authentication
          credentials in clear text. For example, exchanging the PCP username
          in clear text would violate this requirement.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-9:">Confidentiality of the PCP messages is OPTIONAL
          for PCP request and response of opcodes MAP, PEER, ANNOUNCE and
          options THIRD_PARTY, PREFER_FAILURE and FILTER explained in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base">PCP-base</xref>. Other PCP drafts MUST
          evaluate if confidentiality is OPTIONAL or not for new PCP opcodes
          and options introduced.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-10:">The authentication mechanism SHOULD be immune
          to passive dictionary attacks.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-11:">PCP Authentication MUST ensure that an
          attacker snopping the PCP messages cannot guess the SA.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-12:">To ease troubleshooting and ensure fate
          sharing, the PCP authentication and PCP messages MUST be multiplexed
          over the same port.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-13:">PCP authentication MUST accommodate
          authentication between administrative domains. For example, a PCP
          client may wish to communicate directly to an ISP&rsquo;s PCP
          server, even though the in-home CPE router does not support PCP. In
          this scenario the PCP client needs to directly authenticate with the
          ISP&rsquo;s PCP server.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-14:">For the scenarios described in REQ-13, PCP
          authentication mechanism MUST be functional across address and port
          translation, including NAPT64 and NAPT44.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-15:">If a PCP client and server desire
          authentication then a PCP proxy, that modifies PCP request/response
          before forwarding messages, MUST validate message integrity of PCP
          messages from the PCP server and client respectively. <figure>

          <t hangText="REQ-16:">PCP Proxy must also ensure message integrity
          after updating the PCP message for cases described in sections 6 and
          7 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-proxy"></xref>.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-17:">PCP authentication SHOULD support a mechanism
          where only one PCP client on the host will authenticate with the PCP
          server and any other PCP clients SHOULD be able to reuse the
          previously negotiated key for integrity protection. For example,
          multiple applications on the host like BitTorrent <xref
          target="BitTorrent"></xref>, WebRTC<xref
          target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview"> </xref>/SIP <xref
          target="RFC3261"></xref> using PCP.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-18:">All else equal, it is RECOMMENDED to choose a
          widely deployed authentication technique with known security
          properties rather than inventing a new authentication mechanism.</t>

          <t hangText="REQ-19:">Changes in PCP to accommodate authentication
          SHOULD be minimal so that updates and additions to the
          authentication mechanism have no bearing on modifying PCP.</t>
        </list></t>

    <section title="Other recommendations">
      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Upon receiving a challenge with a certain REALM, if the PCP
          client does not have credentials for that REALM, it SHOULD attempt
          to use the username GUEST and password GUEST. The GUEST credentials
          are expected to be configured on infrastructure where PCP
          authentication is not necessary, but such guest users are given some
          (minimal) authorization to use PCP. This addresses the problem when
          the client is visiting foreign networks like hotel, hot spot etc
          where it may gain access to the network but does not know the
          credentials to authenticate to the ISP&rsquo;s PCP server when the
          in-home CPE router does not support PCP and the PCP client needs to
          directly authenticate with the ISP&rsquo;s PCP server (REQ-14).</t>
