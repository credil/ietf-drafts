                   A More Granular Web Origin Concept
                  draft-nir-websec-extended-origin-00

Abstract

   This document defines an HTTP header that allows to partition a
   single origin as defined in RFC 6454 into multiple origins, so that
   the same origin policy applies among them.

   The header introduced in this document allows the portal to specify
   that resources that appear to be from the same origin should, in
   fact, be treated as though they are from different origins, by
   extending the 3-tuple of the origin to a 4-tuple.  The user agent is
   expected to apply the same-origin policy according to the 4-tuple
   rather than the 3-tuple.

Internet-Draft               Extended Origin               February 2012


1.  Introduction

   Web portals such as SSL VPNs "flatten" the Web by providing access to
   multiple web sites through a single host.  For example, a company
   portal may be located at https://sslvpn.example.com, and allow remote
   access to several websites that form the corporate intranet as well
   as webified access to the mail server.  The different services are
   distinguised by implementation-specific manipulation of the URL.  For
   example, the following three URLs may be respectively for the
   internal mail server, for the internal wiki, and for Wikipedia:
   1.  https://sslvpn.example.com/link/my_web_mail/inbox/index.html
   2.  https://sslvpn.example.com/link/the_wiki/index.html
   3.  https://sslvpn.example.com/ext/wikipedia.org

   The problem here is that although there are separate servers, they
   all map to the same origin as defined in [RFC6454].  Scripts from any
   of these sites can affect others.  In fact, the Origin header as
   defined in section 7 of RFC 6454 can leak information to the real web
   server that it is located within the same flattened domain.

   The HTTP header introduced in this document allows the portal to
   specify that URLs that appear to be from the same origin are, in
   fact, from different origins, by extending the 3-tuple of the origin
   to a 4-tuple.  The user agent would be expected to apply the same-
   origin policy according to the 4-tuple rather than the 3-tuple.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  The Extended-Origin Header

   When a web portal hides multiple actual web sites behind its own
   origin, it MUST add the new Extended-Origin header defined in the
   next section.  The name field need not be related to the actual web
   origin, and is not meant for human consumption.  The requirement is
   only that different origins MUST have different names in the header.

   If the response from the original web site already contains one or
   more Extended-Origin headers, then the portal adds its own header
   after the rest.

Internet-Draft               Extended Origin               February 2012


2.1.  Header Format

   The ABNF is to be added.

   The header includes a name, which is not necessarily meant for human
   consumption, and an optional path parameter.  The general format is

       Extended-Origin: name[; path=/something]

   This means that all requests of the format "GET /something/..." will
   be considered as going to the origin defined by the combination of
   the RFC 6454 origin and the name.  As such, cookies from the portal
   MUST not be returned in requests to the extended origin, and vice
   versa.  Scripts from inside the extended origin MUST be prevented
   from executing requests against the main portal and against other
   extended origins within the same portal.

2.2.  Update to the Serialization Requirements

   Section 6 of RFC 6454 defines how to serialize an origin for
   inclusion in the "Origin" header defined in section 7 of that RFC.

   For serializing an extended origin, follow steps 1-5 of section 6.1
   or 6.2 of RFC 6454.  To the result, append a U+0023 code point
   (number sign - #) and the content of the Extended-Origin header.
   Return the result

   If the response contains more than one Extended-Origin header, then
   the user agent MUST append the content of all, separated by number
   symbols, in reverse order.  For example, if the server response looks
   like this:

       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Type: application/octet-stream
       Extended-Origin: webmail
       Extended-Origin: some_other_portal

   Then the origin should be as follows:

       https://sslvpn.example.com#some_other_portal#webmail


3.  Examples

   Here's an example of a connection with both the Extended-Origin and
   the Origin headers.

Internet-Draft               Extended Origin               February 2012


    CONNECT  https://sslvpn.example.com

    GET / HTTP/1.1

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    Set-Cookie: session=1234

    <html>
      <body>
        Welcome, you can read your mail
          <a href="/link/my_web_mail/inbox/index.html">here</a>
      </body>
    </html>

    GET /link/my_web_mail/inbox/index.html HTTP/1.1
    Referer: https://sslvpn.example.com/
    Cookie: session=1234

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    Extended-Origin: my_web_mail; path=/link/my_web_mail
    Set-Cookie: mailsession=5678

    <html>
      <body>
        You have unread message. Jumping there in 5 seconds.
        <script>...</script>
      </body>
    </html>

    GET /link/my_web_mail/inbox/msg0945.html HTTP/1.1
    Referer: https://sslvpn.example.com/link/my_web_mail/inbox/index.htm
    Origin: https://sslvpn.example.com#my_web_mail
    Cookie: mailsession=5678


   In this example, the first GET was the result of the user typing in
   an address, or following a link.  Therefore it has no Origin header.
   It goes to the main page of the portal, so the response contains no
   Extended-Origin.

   The second GET also happened because of clicking a link, not by any
   action of the page, so there's no need to send an Origin header.  If
   there had been such a header, it would be just as defined in RFC
   6454: https://sslvpn.example.com

   The third GET is caused by a script running on the mail page.  This

   page came with an Extended-Origin header, and so the user agent
   constructs the Origin header in the request according to the new
   rules in Section 2.2.

   Note that the cookie set by the main portal was not sent in the third
   request, because it the second reply belongs to a different origin,
   and the request URL matches the path parameter of the Extended-Origin
   header.

   A more complex example is when the portal hides another portal,
   resulting in two Extended-Origin headers.  Shown here:

       CONNECT  https://sslvpn.example.com

       GET /link/someotherportal/mail/index.html HTTP/1.1
       Referer: https://sslvpn.example.com/mainpage.html
       Origin: https://sslvpn.example.com

       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Type: application/octet-stream
       Extended-Origin: webmail; path=/link/someotherportal/mail
       Extended-Origin: some_other_portal; path=/link/webmail
       Set-Cookie: session=90ab

       <html>
         <body>
           You have unread message. Jumping there in 5 seconds.
           <script>...</script>
         </body>
       </html>


       GET /link/someotherportal/my_web_mail/inbox/msg0945.html HTTP/1.1
       Origin: https://sslvpn.example.com#some_other_portal#webmail
       Cookie: session-90ab

   In this example we see that only the first path parameter is
   considered.  The cookies are sent whenever the link matches the first
   path parameter.


4.  CORS interaction

   The interaction between this draft and CORS ([CORS]) is to be added.

5.  Open Issues

5.1.  Other Methods of Encoding Server Identity

   Some SSL-VPN products and configurations do not encode the server
   identity using a prefix in the URL, as shown in the example in
   Section 3.  One such Method is this:

    https://sslvpn.example.com/p/inb/msg0945.html,HOST=mail.example.com

   The issue here is that the way the path parameter is defined, you
   cannot use it to define what URLs belong to the extended origin.  We
   could replace it with a parameter that accepts a regular expression,
   but that seems overly complex:

       Extended-Origin: webmail; expr=/p/*,HOST=mail.example.com


6.  Acknowledgements

   Oren Souroujon contributed some of the text in this document, and
   also came up with the original idea.  Yehezkel Horowitz helped with
   reviewing the draft and pointing out the issues with cookies and
   paths.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document causes compliant clients to disallow certain actions
   that are allowed today.  In that sense, it reduces the attack
   surface.

   More to be added.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The permanent message header field registry (see [RFC3864]) should be
   updated with the following registration:
   o  Header field name: Extended-Origin
   o  Applicable protocol: http
   o  Status: Standard
   o  Author/Change controller: IETF
   o  Specification document: this specification
