    IPv4 and IPv6 Options to support Information Centric Networking
                     draft-detti-conet-ip-option-04

Abstract

   The Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, shifts the focus
   of networking from providing connections between hosts to efficiently
   providing content to the users.  The work on ICN has traditionally
   been performed looking at "clean-slate" solutions which aims to
   replace IP with a new paradigm.  On the other hand, in this memo we
   propose an "integration" approach to Information Centric Networking,
   i.e. we extend the IP protocol using a new IP Option (both for IPv4
   and IPv6).  The new IP option is used by routers to support
   networking based on content rather than (or better in addition to)
   end-point addresses.

Internet-Draft            IP options for CONET             November 2012


1.  Introduction

   In this memo we propose a new approach to Information Centric
   Networking [Koponen07][Jacobson09], based on extending the IP
   protocol by using a new IP Option called CONET IP option (defined
   both for IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC2460]).  The CONET IP option can
   be used by routers to support content aware networking, in addition
   to classical address based networking.  The proposed solution has
   been described in [CONET11].

   The CONET IP option is used to identify the content which is the
   object of the data transfer.  Its usage allows efficient in-network
   caching and replication of content.

   The architecture foresees End-Nodes, Serving Nodes and CONET nodes
   (see Figure 1).  End-Nodes request for content.  Serving Nodes
   provide content.  CONET nodes: i) forward content requests from End-
   Nodes to Serving Nodes; ii) deliver content from Serving Nodes to
   End-Nodes; iii) may cache content and therefore provide it to End-
   Nodes without contacting the Serving Node.  CONET nodes can be
   further classified in Border Nodes and Internal nodes.  Border Nodes
   are able to perform both "forward-by-name" and caching, Internal
   nodes are not able to perform "forward-by-name" (but only plain IP
   routing) and can only perform caching.

                       Figure 1: CONET architecture

   As shown in Figure 1, the CONET Information Centric Network can be
   seen as the inteconnection of CONET Sub Systems (CSSs).  A CSS
   contains CONET nodes and exploits an under-CONET technology to
   transfer data among CONET nodes.  A CSS could be: i) a couple of
   nodes interconnected by a point-to-point link, e.g. a PPP link or a
   UDP/IP overlay link; ii) a layer-2 network, e.g.  Ethernet; iii) a
   layer-3 network, e.g. a private/public IPv4 or IPv6 network, or a
   whole IP Autonomous System, or even the whole current Internet.

   In addition to the new CONET IP option, the proposed solution needs a
   new Internet Protocol Number to identify the CONET protocol.


2.  CONET IP Option

   The CONET IPv4 option has the following format:


                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                    |100xxxxx|yyyyyyyy|pppLLSCr|  DS&T  |

                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                    | optional extensions (TLV fields)  |
                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+

   The CONET IPv6 option has the following format:


                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                    |001xxxxx|yyyyyyyy|pppLLSCr|  DS&T  |

                    |                ...                |
                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                    |CSN(opt)|optional CSN cont.   ...  |
                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+
                    | optional extensions (TLV fields)  |
                    +--------+--------+--------+--------+

                    Figure 3: CONET IP Option for IPv6



For IPv4 the first byte (the option type) is as follows:

Type:
  Copied flag:  1 (all fragments must carry the option)
  Option class: 0 (control)
  Option number: xxxxx (decimal) TO BE ALLOCATED BY IANA

For IPv6 the first byte (the option tyep) is as follows:

Type:
  Unrecognized option action : 00
              (skip option, process the rest of the header)
  Change allowed flag        : 0
              (option data cannot change while the datagram is en route)
  Option number: xxxxx (decimal) TO BE ALLOCATED BY IANA

   differentiate between different types of CONET Information Units
   (CIUs)

   LL : ICN-ID Length Specification - This two bits field provides the
   length of ICN Identifier (ICN-ID) field or specifies how the ICN-ID
   length is provided.

   S : Sequence number indication - This one bit field tells if a chunk
   Sequence Number fiels is present in the Option after the ICN-ID field


      0  No Chunk Sequence Number field is present
      1  Chunk Sequence Number field is present after the ICN-ID field

   C : cache indication - This one bit field is used to control cache
   operations.


      0  No cache
      1  Cache

   Within Information Units that request for content (e.g. interest
   CIU), if the bit is set to "No cache" it indicates to the crossed
   nodes not to look for the content in the cache, but to forward the
   request toward the source.  Within Information Units that carry
   content (e.g. named-data CIU), if the bit is set to "No cache" it
   indicates to the crossed nodes not to cache the content.

   r : reserved - This one bit field in the first byte after the option
   length is reserved.

   DS&T : Diffserv and Type - This one byte field is used to
   differentiate quality of services that can be provided by the network
   to the delivered content and to identify the content type.  This
   field can be used to encode the content type and the priority as
   follows:

                    +--------+


   The righmost bit can be considere as a flag F. If the flag bit F is
   set to 0 the three rightmost bits encode 8 priority levels and other
   4 bits are for the content-type.  If the flag bit is set to one, no
   preallocated semantic to the remaining bits is given.

   ICN-ID : ICN Identifier (ICN-ID) field - The ICN-ID is a unique
   identifier for the content.  The ICN-ID is carried in the ICN-ID
   field.  How to determine the length of this field is defined by the
   ICN-ID Length Specification field.  If the ICN-ID Length
   Specification field determines the field length, the ICN-ID field
   only carries the ICN-ID.  If the ICN-ID Length Specification field
   indicates that the field length is carried in the field itself, the
   ICN-ID field starts with a one byte field that determines its length.

Internet-Draft            IP options for CONET             November 2012


  If ICN-ID Length Specification = 0 (i.e. 16 bytes len),
  the ICN-ID field is as follows:

               +--------+--------+--------+--------+
               |               ICN-ID              |
               +--------+--------+--------+--------+
               |                                   |
               +--------+--------+--------+--------+
               |                                   |
               +--------+--------+--------+--------+
               |                                   |
               +--------+--------+--------+--------+

  If ICN-ID Length Specification = 2 (i.e. ICN-ID starts with a one byte
  length field), the ICN-ID field is as follows:

               +--------+--------+--------+--------+
               | length |       ICN-ID             |
               +--------+--------+--------+--------+
               |                ...                |
               +--------+--------+--------+--------+
               |                ...                |

   The ICN-ID starts with a two bytes field called ICN-ID namespace ID
   that determines the structure of the rest of the ICN-ID.  ICN-ID
   namespace values needs to be assigned by the IANA.  Note that in most
   circumstances, the ICN-ID can be processed by the routers as an
   opaque object, as described in Section 5.  This is why the ICN-ID
   namespace ID has been included at the beginning of the ICN-ID itself.
   In other cases the nodes are requested to perform a forward-by-name
   procedure, which may require a semantic understanding of the ICN-ID.

   CSN : Chunk Sequence Number - This optional field carries the Chunk
   Sequence Number that identifies a portion of the content.  When a
   content is split in a sequence of smaller unit called "chunks", this
   field can explitly carry the sequence number of the chunk (another
   solution is obvioulsy to embed the chunk number in the ICN-ID).  The

   Chunk Sequence Number is represented with a variable number of bytes.
   An initial bit pattern determines the length of the CSN field.


   1 byte CSN (7 bits CSN range)
       +--------+
       |0       |
       +--------+

   2 bytes CSN (14 bit CSN range)
       +--------+--------+
       |10               |
       +--------+--------+

   3 bytes CSN (21 bit CSN range)
       +--------+--------+--------+
       |110     |        |        |
       +--------+--------+--------+

   4 bytes CSN (28 bit CSN range)
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       |1110    |        |        |        |
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+

   5 bytes CSN (32 bit CSN range)
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       |11110000|        |        |        |
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       |        |
       +--------+

   6 bytes CSN (40 bit CSN range)
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       |11110001|        |        |        |
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       |        |        |
       +--------+--------+


   Binary patterns from 11110010 to 11111111 are reserved.  They can be
   used to extend the CSN range if needed.  With the above defined
   option, we can have up to 2^40 chunks in a content.  Assuming a
   relatively small chunk size of 1 KBytes, it is possible to have a
   content of 1099 TeraBytes, while assuming a more reasonable chunk
   size of 256 Kbyte it is possible to have a content of 281474
   TeraBytes (218 PetaBytes).

   The rationale for having a variable length encoding is the following.



Detti, et al.             Expires June 3, 2013                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            IP options for CONET             November 2012


   The CSN range for a given content is determined by the content size
   divided by the chunk size.  As content of very different sizes can be
   transmitted, the CSN range can be very different.  Therefore it is
   not efficient to dimension this field considering the maximum number
   of chunks in which a content can be split.


3.  IPv6 handling of CONET option

   The IPv6 CONET option has to be interpreted by all routers in the
   path that are ICN capable.  Therefore we it naturally fits into the
   the IPv6 Hop-by-hop header, which is the first extension header that
   can be present after the fixed part of the header.  The Hop-by-hop
   header is meant to be read by all routers in the path.


4.  CONET protocol

   In the previous section, we have seen the description of the CONET IP
   option that is carried in the header of IP packets.  The payload of
   IP packets is the CONET protocol and a specific IP protocol number is
   assigned to it:

   CONET IP protocol number : xxx (to be assigned by IANA).

   The figure below shows the CONET protocol stack.  CONET protocol is
   divided in two sub-layers, whose data unit are respectively denoted
   as "Carrier Packets" and "CONET Information Units".  A CONET
   Information Unit (CIU) can be split into different Carrier Packets.
   Each Carrier Packet is transported by an IP packet.  There are
   different types of CONET Information Units, the CIU type information
   is carried in the CONET Information Unit Type field in the CONET IP
   option.

   The generic structure of a Carrier Packet (CP) is reported hereafter:


       +-------------------------+
       |    CP Payload header    |
       +-------------------------+
       |       CP Payload        |
       +-------------------------+
       |      CP Path state      |
       +-------------------------+

   The information contained in the CP Payload header is specific for
   each CIU type and can depend on the "transport" protocol.  It will be
   described in other specification documents.  The definition of a
   receiver driven ICN transport protocol called ICTP (Information
   Centric Transport Protocol) is proposed in [I-D.ICTP] (see also
   [ICTP12]).  The CP payload header contains the length of the CP
   Payload and allows to identify the start of the CP Path state field.
   The CP Path state field can be used in End-Nodes, Border Nodes and
   Serving Nodes to assist in the forwarding operation of carrier
   packet, therefore it is described here.

   The CP Path State field stores the End-Node address and the addresses
   of the set of crossed Border Nodes in the path from End-Node to the
   Serving Node (or to a border or Intermediate Node that provides a
   requested content).  The format of the CP path state field is
   reported hereafter (assuming that IPv4 addresses are carried).  The
   use of CP Path state is optional, as the path from End-Node to
   Serving Node can be stored in the so called PIT (Pending Interest
   Table) in the crossed nodes [Jacobson09].  A node crossed by an
   Interest packet can either add its address to the CP Path State (and
   create the CP Path State field if not present) or store the pending
   interest in the PIT.

                | addr 3 | addr 4 |
                +--------+--------+


   The length field specifies the length of the CP Path State field in
   bytes.  If the first bit of the len field is 0, the remaining 7 bits
   of the first byte are used as len field and both the length field and
   the pointer field are one byte length.  In this case the maximum
   value of the length of the CP Path State field is 127.  If the first
   bit of the len field is 1, both the length field and the pointer
   field are two bytes length.  In this case the maximum value of the
   length of the CP Path State field is 32767.

   The pointer field specifies the offset, starting from the start of
   the CP Path State field where the last address has been inserted.

   Each address is represented as a couple (ad-type, address) it could
   be represented by a triple (ad-type, ad-length, address) if the
   address type is of variable length.  The ad-type field is one byte
   size and currently admitted values are:


      0     Reserved
      1     Public IPv4 address (len is 4 bytes, no ad-length needed)
      2     Public Ipv6 address (len is 16 bytes, no ad-length needed))
      3     Ethernet address (len is 6 bytes, no ad-length needed))
      4-255 Reserved

5.  Procedures

5.1.  Interest CONET Information Unit (Interest CIU)

5.1.1.  Processing in the End-Node

   An end-node that wants to retrieve a content (or better a Chunk of a
   content) issues an Interest CIU, the ICN-ID and the Chunk Sequence
   Number of the required Content are respectively transported in the
   ICN Identifier (ICN-ID) field and in the CSN field of the CONET IP
   option.  The end-node stores its IP address in CP path state field,
   initializing the pointer field.  Assuming for simplicity that the
   Interest CIU will fit into a single Carrier Packet, the Interest CIU
   will be included in the Carrier Packet that in turn is inserted into
   an IP packet.

   The end-node must now determine the destination IP address for the
   Carrier Packet.  The end-node performs a forward-by-name operation,
   trying to associate the ICN-ID with a next hop (i.e. with the IP
   address of the next hop).  The next hop can be the Serving Node (if
   the Serving Node is in the same CONET Sub System of the end-node) or
   a Border Node of the CONET Sub System (if the Serving Node is in a
   different CONET Sub System).  Typically the End-Node does not
   participate to the content routing protocols, therefore it cannot
   resolve the ICN-ID into the address of the next hop, but it has to
   ask an external entity, behaving in a similar way of a current name
   server (such external entity could be a part of a system that handles
   the content routing, called Routing Name System).  Once this
   information is retrieved, the end-note can fill the IP destination
   address in the IP header and sends the packet.  The end-node may
   cache the mapping (ICN-ID -> next hop) into its memory as well.

5.1.2.  Processing in the Serving Node

   If the Serving Node is in the same CONET than the end-node, the
   Serving Node IP address will be used a destination IP address by the
   end-node.  The Serving Node will receive an IP packet directed to
   itself, whose IP protocol number is "CONET".  Therefore the packet
   will be internally dispatched toward the "CONET entity" in the
   Serving Node.  The CONET entity reads the CONET information unit type
   from the CONET IP options and recognizes that the received packet is
   an interest packet.  Then it reads the ICN-ID and Chunk Sequence
   Number in the CONET IP option, the ICN-ID will correspond to a
   content provided by the Serving Node.  The CONET entity will then
   process the CONET transport protocol information carried in the IP
   payload, which may for example specify a requested offset within the
   chunk.  Finally the CONET entity will respond to the interest packet
   by sending the requested named-data CIU.

Internet-Draft            IP options for CONET             November 2012


5.1.3.  Processing in the Border Node

   If the Serving Node is in a different CONET Sub System than the end-
   node, the address of a CONET Border Node will be used a destination
   IP address by the end-node.  The Border Node will receive an IP
   packet directed to itself, whose IP protocol number is "CONET".
   Therefore the packet will be internally dispatched toward the "CONET
   entity" in the Border Node.  The CONET entity reads the CONET
   information unit type from the CONET IP options and recognizes that
   the received packet is an interest packet.  Then it reads the ICN-ID
   and Chunk Sequence Number in the CONET IP option and is able to
   understand which content and which part of the available content it
   needs to provide.  If the Cache indication field is set to "No Cache"
   or if the field is set to "Cache" but the chunk is not available in
   the cache, the Border Node starts the forward-by-name process.  It
   will resolve the next hop of the interest packet, which can be a
   Serving Node in a different CONET Sub System (with respect to the one
   from which the interest packet was received) connected to the Border
   Node, or another Border Node in the path toward the Serving Node.
   Before sending out the packet, the Border Node adds its IP address in
   the CP Path State field and updates the pointer field.  Note that
   these procedures needs to be performed in the "fast path" of the
   Border Node (in this case the CONET entity in the Border Node can be
   seen as an integral part of the enhanced IP protocol).  If the Cache
   indication field is set to "Cache" and the Border Node has found that
   the chunk corresponding to the ICN-ID/CSN is available in its cache,
   the Border Node will process the CONET transport protocol information
   carried in the IP payload, which may for example specify a requested
   offset within the chunk and it will respond to the interest packet by
   sending the requested named-data CIU.

5.1.4.  Processing in the Intermediate Node

   When a packet is sent to the CONET next hop (as selected by the End-
   Node or by a Border Node) using the IP destination address of the
   next hop resolved by the forward-by-name, it can cross different IP
   routers in the path from the sending node and the next hop.  A
   crossed router that is aware of the CONET IP option, is a CONET
   Intermediate Node.  This node may have cached the the chunk that is
   requested by the interest packet.  The Intermediate Node works as
   follows.  When processing the IP header for the received packet, it
   finds that the packet contains the CONET IP option.  If the Cache
   indication field is set to "No Cache", the Intermediate Node forwards
   the packet using the destination IP address.  If the Cache indication
   field is set to "Cache", the Intermediate Node checks the presence of
   the chunk in its cache before forwarding the IP packet.  Therefore,
   it reads the ICN-ID and Chunk Sequence Number in the CONET IP option
   and checks if the chunk is present in its cache.  If the chunk is not

Internet-Draft            IP options for CONET             November 2012


   present, the normal IP processing is continued.  Note that these
   operations needs to be performed in the "fast path" of the router and
   they only require information that is transported in the IP option.
   If the chunk is present in the CONET router cache, the router will
   process the CONET transport protocol information carried in the IP
   payload, which may for example specify a requested offset within the
   chunk and it will respond to the interest packet by sending the
   requested named-data CIU.

5.1.5.  Processing in the legacy routers

   When a packet is sent to the CONET next hop (as selected by the End-
   Node or by a Border Node) using the IP destination address of the
   next hop resolved by the forward-by-name, it can cross different IP
   routers in the path from the sending node and the next hop.  If a
   crossed router is a legacy router not aware of the CONET IP option,
   it will simply forward the packet looking at the IP destination
   address.  Note that a requirement for such legacy router is to be
   configured not to drop IP packets carrying unidentified IP options.

5.2.  Named data CONET Information Unit (Named data CIU)

5.2.1.  Processing in the responding node

   The responding node is the node that is able to provide a content
   (identified by ICN-ID and Chunk Sequence Number) to a requesting end-
   node.  Therefore the responding node can be a Serving Node which
   provides an original copy of the content, or a Border Node /
   Intermediate Node that provide a cached copy of the content.  The
   responding node will use the Path State information contained in the
   received carrier packet carrying the Interest CIU to forward back the
   carrier packets containing the named-data CIU towards the requesting
   end-node.  In particular, it will use the pointer field to read the
   last address in the list and will use it as IP destination address
   for the Carrier packet carrying the named-data CIU.  We can denote
   this address as "CONET previous hop".  Then it will update the
   pointer field so that the next node will use the previous address in
   the list.  It may choose to strip the used address from the list in
   the CP Path state, thereby reducing the CP Path State field length.

5.2.2.  Processing in a Border Node

   The Border Node will receive an IP packet directed to itself, whose
   IP protocol number is "CONET".  Therefore the packet will be
   internally dispatched toward the "CONET entity" in the Border Node.
   The CONET entity reads the CONET information unit type from the CONET
   IP options and recognizes that the received packet is a named-data
   packet.  Again, we stress that this processing should be performed in



Detti, et al.             Expires June 3, 2013                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft            IP options for CONET             November 2012


   the fast path.  Being a named-data packet, the Border Node will read
   the CP Path State field in the Carrier Packet and by using the
   pointer field will identify the CONET previous hop in the path
   towards the requesting end-node.  Before sending out the packet, it
   will update the pointer field in the CP Path State field.  The
   destination IP address of the packet will be set to the CONET
   previous hop retrieved from the CP Path State field.  If the Cache
   indication bit in the IP option is set to "Cache", the Border Node
   may choose to cache the CIU that is transported by the carried
   packet.  In this case, it is reccomended that the Border Node
   dispatches the packet as soon as possible and operates on a local
   copy to perform cache related operations.

5.2.3.  Processing in an Intermediate Node

   An Intermediate Node, i.e. a router in the path between a Serving
   Node or a Border Node and the CONET previous hop, which is aware of
   the CONET option, may decide to cache the named data CIU transported
   by a carrier packet.  The Intermediate Node will receive an IP packet
   with an IP destination equal to the CONET previous hop and will
   immediately forward this packet using IP routing.  Then, if the Cache
   indication bit in the IP option is set to "Cache", the Intermediate
   Node may choose to cache the CIU that is transported by the carried
   packet.

5.2.4.  Processing in the legacy routers

   When a packet is sent to the CONET previous hop (as selected by the
   Serving Node or by a Border Node) using the IP destination address of
   the previous hop obtained using the CP Path State information, it can
   cross different IP routers in the path from the sending node and the
   previous hop.  If a crossed router is a legacy router not aware of
   the CONET IP option, it will simply forward the packet looking at the
   IP destination address.  Note that a requirement for such legacy
   router is to be configured not to drop IP packets carrying
   unidentified IP options.


6.  Forward-by-name framework

   The forward-by-name process is performed in the end-node and in
   Border Nodes in order to resolve a ICN-ID into the next hop towards a
   Serving Node for the given ICN-ID.  This document provides a
   framework under which the forward-by-name procedures can be
   performed, and assures that different forward-by-name procedures and
   approaches may coexist.  These different approaches needs to be
   separately specified.  The format and the semantic of the ICN-ID may
   need to be specified when defining a specific forward-by-name



Detti, et al.             Expires June 3, 2013                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft            IP options for CONET             November 2012


   approach.  This is made possible by the concept of ICN-ID name space
   ID, which is carried within the ICN-ID.

   The basic procedure that a forward-by-name framework needs to offer
   is called resolveICN-ID, it takes as input the ICN-ID and returns the
   next_hop_address.  This procedure is performed by end-nodes and by
   Border Nodes that are not able to provide a cached response for a
   content requested by an End-Node.

   resolveICN-ID (ICN-ID) -> next_hop_address

   The tables on which the forward-by-name procedures are based are
   populated by Serving Nodes and by Border Nodes.  The procedure is
   initiated by Serving Nodes that advertize the hosted content with the
   advertizeICN-ID procedure.  In turn, the procedure is replicated by
   the Border Nodes that spread the received advertising toward other
   Border Nodes.  This procedure takes as input a ICN-ID, the address of
   the node performing the procedure, and the path information towards
   the Serving Node as seen by the node performing the procedure.
   Depending on the specific content routing approach, the path
   information can be simply an hop count, or it could be the path list
   (as in the BGP AS-PATH).

   advertizeICN-ID (ICN-ID, node_address, path_info)

   In the following section we define two CONET default name spaces.  It
   could be more appropriate that in future version of this document
   this specification is provided in a separate document.


7.  CONET default namespaces

   We define two default ICN-ID name spaces for CONET, one is based on
   variable length strings as ICN-ID, as it was proposed in
   [Jacobson09], the second one is based on fixed length hashes.  The
   two namespaces are assigned the following ICN-ID name space IDs.


   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Namespace ID |                                                 |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |        1     | VLL (Variable Length Label) ICN-ID namespace     |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |        2     | PLHB (Principal/Label Hash Based) ICN-ID namesp.|
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+


   In the VLL (Variable Length Label) CONET namespace the ICN-ID is



Detti, et al.             Expires June 3, 2013                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft            IP options for CONET             November 2012


   simply the string representation of a resource.  As described in
   [Jacobson09] ICN-IDs are hierarchically structured so that an
   individual name is composed of a number of components (see
   [Jacobson09] for further details.  An authority is needed to ensure
   the uniqueness of the ICN-IDs.  The approach should be similar on how
   the uniqueness of DNS names is granted in today's Internet.

   In the Principal/Label Hash Based CONET namespace the ICN-ID is the
   composition of two hash values, as follows:

   ICN-ID = ( hash (Principal) , hash (Label) )

   In the Principal/Label Hash Based CONET namespace the Hash(principal)
   is a 8 bytes hash of a string representing the Principal.  The Label
   is a 6 bytes hash of a string representing the label.  A central
   authority is needed to ensure the uniqueness of the Hash(principal),
   i.e. a Principal cannot be assigned if its hash collides with an
   already assigned hash.  The Principal is responsible to ensuring that
   each Hash(Label) belonging to the Principal are unique.  Therefore a
   Label cannot be used by a Principal if its hash collides with the
   Hash of an already used Label.

9.  Performance Considerations

   IP Options have often been criticized because their support in
   current routers would impose a performance penalty, but we can assume
   here that routers will be modified to support Information Centric
   Networking.  Compared with "clean slate" approaches where CCN nodes
   could be completely different with respect to routers, we believe
   that we are able to provide all the functionality we need for
   Information Centric Networking, with reasonable modification in
   router architectures and preserving all the functionality of current
   IP networking.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the allocation of one IP option by the IANA.

   This document requires the allocation of one IP protocol number by
