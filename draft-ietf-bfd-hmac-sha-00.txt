Abstract

   This document describes how Hashed Message Authentication Mode (HMAC)
   in conjunction with the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms can
   be used for authenticating Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).
   It uses the Generic Cryptographic Authentication and Generic
   Meticulous Cryptographic Authentication sections to carry the
   authentication data.  This updates, but does not supercede, the
   cryptographic authentication mechanism specified in RFC 5880.

Internet-Draft                BFD HMAC-SHA                  January 2012


1.  Introduction

   The cryptographic authentication mechanisms specified in BFD
   [RFC5880] defines MD5 [RFC1321] and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)
   algorithms to authenticate BFD packets.  The recent escalating series
   of attacks on MD5 and SHA-1 [SHA-1-attack1] [SHA-1-attack2] raise
   concerns about their remaining useful lifetime [RFC6151] [RFC6194].

   These attacks may not necessarily result in direct vulnerabilities
   for Keyed-MD5 and Keyed-SHA-1 digests as message authentication codes
   because the colliding message may not correspond to a syntactically
   correct BFD protocol packet.  Regardless, there is a need felt to
   deprecate MD5 and SHA-1 as the basis for the HMAC algorithm in favor
   of stronger digest algorithms.

   This document adds support for Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) defined
   in the US NIST Secure Hash Standard (SHS), which is defined by NIST
   FIPS 180-2 [FIPS-180-2].  [FIPS-180-2] includes SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-
   256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  The HMAC authentication mode defined in
   NIST FIPS 198 is used [FIPS-198].

   It is believed that [RFC2104] is mathematically identical to [FIPS-
   198] and it is also believed that algorithms in [RFC6234] are
   mathematically identical to [FIPS-180-2].

   It should be noted that if SHA-1 is used in the HMAC construction
   then collision attacks currently known against SHA-1 do not apply.
   The new attacks on SHA-1 have no impact on the security of
   HMAC-SHA-1.  NIST will be supporting HMAC-SHA-1 even after 2010
   [NIST-HMAC-SHA] , whereas it would be dropping support for SHA-1 in
   digital signatures.

   [I-D.ietf-bfd-generic-crypto-auth] defines new authentication types -
   Generic Cryptographic Authentication and Generic Meticulous
   Cryptographic Authenticationan extension that can be used for
   carrying the authentication digests defined in this document.

   Implementations of this specification must include support for at
   least HMAC-SHA-256 and may include support for either of HMAC-SHA-384
   or HMAC-SHA-512.


2.  Cryptographic Aspects

   In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, which
   is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used:

   H is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g.  SHA-256).

Internet-Draft                BFD HMAC-SHA                  January 2012


   K is the password for the BFD packet.

   Ko is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm.

   B is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits.  Note
   that B is the internal block size, not the hash size.  For SHA-1 and
   SHA-256: B == 64 For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128 L is the length of
   the hash, measured in octets rather than bits.

   XOR is the exclusive-or operation.

   Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times.

   Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times.

   Apad is the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times.

   (1)Preparation of the Key

   In this application, Ko is always L octets long.

   If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is equal to
   K. If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L octets long, then Ko
   is set to H(K).  If the Authentication Key (K) is less than L octets
   long, then Ko is set to the Authentication Key (K) with zeros
   appended to the end of the Authentication Key (K) such that Ko is L
   octets long.

   (2)First Hash

   First, the Authentication Data field in the Generic Authentication
   Section is filled with the value Apad and the Authentication Type
   field is set to 6 or 7 depending upon which Authentication Type is
   being used.  The Sequence Number field MUST be set to
   bfd.XmitAuthSeq.

   Then, a first hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed as
   follows:

   First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (BFD Packet))

   (3)Second Hash T

   Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is computed as
   follows:

   Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash)

Internet-Draft                BFD HMAC-SHA                  January 2012


   (4)Result

   The resultant Second-Hash becomes the Authentication Data that is
   sent in the Authentication Data field of the BFD Authentication
   Section.  The length of the Authentication Data field is always
   identical to the message digest size of the specific hash function H
   that is being used.

   This also means that the use of hash functions with larger output
   sizes will also increase the size of BFD Packet as transmitted on the
   wire.


3.  Procedures at the Sending Side

   Before a BFD device sends a BFD packet out, the device needs to
   select an appropriate BFD SA from its local key table if a keyed
   digest for the packet is required.  If no appropriate SA is
   avaliable, the BFD packet MUST be discarded.

   If an appropriate SA is avaliable, the device then derives the key
   and the associated authentication algorithm (HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-
   384 or HMAC-SHA-512) from the SA.

   The device then start performing the operations illustrated in
   Section 2.  Before the authentication data is computed, the device
   MUST fill the Auth Type and the Auth length .  The Sequence Number
   field MUST be set to bfd.XmitAuthSeq.

   The value of Auth Length in the generic authentication section is
   various according to different authentication algorithms being used.
   Specifically, the value is 40 for HMAC-SHA-256, 56 for HMAC-SHA-384
   and 72 for HMAC- SHA-512.

   The Key ID is then filled.

   After that, the authentication data is computed as illustrated in
   Section 3.

   The result of the authentication algorithm is placed in the
   Authentication data, following the Key ID.


4.  Procedure at the Receiving Side

   Upon receiving a BFD packet with an generic authentication section
   appended, the receiving device needs to find an appropriate BFD SA
   from its local key table to verify the packet.  The SA is located by

   the Key ID in the authentication section of the packet.

   If there is no SA is associated with the Key ID, the received packet
   MUST be discarded.

   If bfd.AuthSeqKnown is 1, examine the Sequence Number field.  For
   Cryptographic Authentication, if the Sequence Number lies outside of
   the range of bfd.RcvAuthSeq to bfd.RcvAuthSeq+(3*Detect Mult)
   inclusive (when treated as an unsigned 32 bit circular number space),
   the received packet MUST be discarded.  For Meticulous Cryptographic
   Authentication, if the Sequence Number lies outside of the range of
   bfd.RcvAuthSeq+1 to bfd.RcvAuthSeq+(3*Detect Mult) inclusive (when
   treated as an unsigned 32 bit circular number space, the received
   packet MUST be discarded.

   Authentication Algorithm dependent processing, needs to be performed,
   using the algorithm specified by the appropriate BFD SA for the
   received packet.

   Before the device performs any processing, it needs to save the
   values of the Authentication Value field.

   The device then needs to set the Authentication Value field with Apad
   before the authentication data is computed.  The calculated data is
   compared with the received authentication data in the packet.

   The packet MUST be discarded if the calculated data and the received
   authentication data do not match each other.  In such a case, an
   error event SHOULD be logged.

   A BFD implementation MAY be in a transition mode where it includes
   CRYPTO_AUTH or the MET_CRYPTO_AUTH information in packets but never
   verifies it.  This is provided as a transition aid for networks in
   the process of migrating to the new CRYPTO_AUTH and MET_CRYPTO_AUTH
   based authentication schemes.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


6.  Security Considerations

   The approach described in this document enhances the security of the

   BFD protocol by adding, to the existing BFD cryptographic
   authentication methods, support for the SHA-2 algorithms defined in
   the NIST Secure Hash Standard (SHS) using the HMAC mode.  However,
   the confidentiality protection for BFD packets is out of scope of
   this work .

   Because all of the currently specified algorithms use symmetric
   cryptography, one cannot authenticate precisely which BFD device sent
   a given packet.  However, one can authenticate that the sender knew
   the BFD Security Association (including the BFD SA's parameters)
   currently in use.

   To enhance system security, the applied keys should be changed
   periodically and implementations SHOULD be able to store and use more
   than one key at the same time.  The quality of the security provided
   by the cryptographic authentication option depends completely on the
   strength of the cryptographic algorithm and cryptographic mode in
   use, the strength of the key being used, and the correct
   implementation of the security mechanism in all communicating BFD
   implementations.  Accordingly, the use of high assurance development
   methods is recommended.  It also requires that all parties maintain
   the secrecy of the shared secret key.  [RFC4086] provides guidance on
   methods for generating cryptographically random bits.

   The value Apad is used here primarily for consistency with IETF
   specifications for HMAC-SHA authentication of RIPv2 SHA [RFC4822],
   IS-IS SHA and OSPF SHA [RFC5709].
