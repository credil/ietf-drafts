1.  Introduction

   In March 2006, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) described an
   attack on core routing infrastructure as an ideal attack that would
   inflict the greatest amount of damage, in their Report from the IAB
   workshop on Unwanted Traffic March 9-10, 2006 [RFC4948], and
   suggested steps to tighten the infrastructure against the attack.
   Four main steps were identified for that tightening:

   1.  Create secure mechanisms and practices for operating routers.

   2.  Clean up the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) repository, and
       securing both the database and the access, so that it can be used
       for routing verifications.

   3.  Create specifications for cryptographic validation of routing
       message content.

   4.  Secure the routing protocols' packets on the wire.

   In order to secure the routing protocols this document performs an
   initial analysis of the current state of RSVP-TE according to the
   requirements of KARP Design Guidelines [RFC6518].  This draft builds
   on several previous analysis efforts into routing security:

Internet-Draft              RSVP-TE Analysis               November 2013


   o  Issues with existing Cryptographic Protection Methods for Routing
      Protocols [RFC6039] an analysis of cryptographic issues with
      routing protocols.

   o  Analysis of OSPF Security According to KARP Design Guide
      [RFC6863].

   o  Analysis of BGP, LDP, PCEP, and MSDP Issues According to KARP
      Design Guide [RFC6952] which is a analysis of the four routing
      protocols.

   Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] is a resource
   reservation setup protocol designed for an integrated services.  RSVP
   Security Properties [RFC4230] indicates the unfeasibility of using
   IPSec to secure RSVP signaling messages.  RSVP Cryptographic
   Authentication [RFC2747] describes the format and use of RSVP's
   INTEGRITY objects to provide hop-by-hop integrity and authentication
   of RSVP messages.  RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels
   [RFC3209] is an extension of the RSVP protocol to establish Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switch Paths (LSPs).  RSVP-TE
   signaling messages are used to establish both intra- and inter-domain
   TE LSPs.  The security mechanisms for RSVP, RSVP Cryptographic
   Authentication [RFC2747] can be used by RSVP-TE to provide the
   security protection for the RSVP-TE message transportation.
   Therefore, the rest of the document will focus on the current state
   of security efforts for RSVP and assume that will apply to RSVP-TE
   also.

   Section 2 looks at the current security state of RSVP-TE.  Section 3
   does an analysis of the gap between the existing and the optimal
   security state of the protocol and suggest some areas where we need
   to improve.

2.  Current Assessment of RSVP-TE

   This section looks at RSVP-TE and the underlying transport protocol
   and key mechanisms built for the protocol.

2.1.  Transport Layer

   RSVP operates on top of IPv4 or IPv6, occupying the place of a
   transport protocol in the protocol stack.  However, RSVP does not
   transport application data but is rather an Internet control
   protocol, like ICMP, IGMP, or routing protocols.

2.1.1.  UDP Encapsulation

   An RSVP implementation generally requires the ability to perform
   "raw" network I/O. However, some systems may not support raw network
   I/O. To use RSVP, such hosts must encapsulate RSVP messages in UDP.

2.2.  Keying Mechanism

   Section 7 of RSVP Cryptographic Authentication discusses the
   possibility of using Kerberos to generate and distribute RSVP
   authentication keys.  However, the design of Automated Key Management
   (AKM) mechanism for RSVP is still incomplete.  There is no other AKM
   solution proposed at this time.  If anything, manual key management
   is used.

Internet-Draft              RSVP-TE Analysis               November 2013


   The protocol states that manual keying should be supported and states
   the need for a key management protocol to distribute keys.  It even
   states that the Key Identifier be the hook between RSVP and the key
   management protocol.  But it deliberately excludes defining a
   integrated key management protocol technique in the document.  It
   does define a key lifetime that should be recorded for all systems
   although how they are presented e.g. using the start time and the end
   time of the key life period, is not specified.  It even advises that
   the keys should be changed on a regular basis and that multiple keys
   should be used to transition from one key to another.

2.3.  Message Integrity and Node Authentication

   RSVP-TE makes use of RSVP Cryptographic Authentication [RFC2747].
   Note that there is currently no RSVP-TE specific security mechanism.
   It is required that RSVP-TE headers and payload be authenticated, but
   there is no requirement that RSVP-TE headers be encrypted.

   RSVP Cryptographic Authentication [RFC2747] defines the use HMAC-MD5
   for both message integrity and node authentication.  The length of
   the keyed digests is 128 bits.  In these cases RSVP checksum can be
   disabled in lieu of message digest.  In addition, no algorithm
   agility is supported.

2.4.  Replay Protection

   RSVP uses 64 bit monotonically increasing sequence numbers to prevent
   against replay attacks.  The sequence number space is large enough to
   guarantee that a sequence number will never reach its maximum and
   roll back within a reasonable long period.

   The solution provides three approaches to generate unique
   monotonically increasing sequence numbers across a failure or a
   restart.  The solutions include:

   1.  Maintaining sequence numbers in stable memory

   2.  Introducing the data from a local time clock into the generation
       of sequence numbers after a restart

   3.  Introducing the timing information from a Network Recovered Clock
       into the generation of sequence numbers after a restart.

   In addition, a handshake is defined for a receiver to get the latest
   value of a sequence number.  Therefore, this solution is effective in
   addressing the issues caused by the rollback of sequence numbers
   across a system restart or failure.  However, when a router uses the
   approach to generating sequence numbers with the time information

   from NTP, an attacker may try to deceive the router to generate a
   sequence number which is less than the sequence numbers it used to
   have, by sending replayed or foiled NTP information.

2.5.  Out of Order Protection

   To address the issue of out-of-order message delivery, the solution
   proposed in RSVP Cryptographic Authentication [RFC2747] allows
   administrators to specify a sequence number window corresponding to
   the worst case reordering behavior.  Instead of requiring the
   sequence number of an incoming packet to be strictly larger than the
   ones previously received, a packet will be accepted if its sequence
   number is within the window.

2.6.  Denial of Service Attack Protection

   RSVP does not explicitly mention Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and
   how to prevent against it.  However, a RSVP-TE node does know the
   peers that it should be communicating with and can therefore accept
   packets from known hosts only.  This feature can largely mitigate the
   security risks caused by DoS attacks.

3.  Gap Analysis for RSVP-TE

   This section outlines the differences between the current state of
   RSVP-TE and the desired state as outlined in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of
   KARP Design Guidelines [RFC6518].

   In RSVP Cryptographic Authentication [RFC2747], only the usage of MD5
   to generate digests for RSVP-TE messages is defined.  In order to
   fulfill the requirement of supporting strong algorithms and
   cryptographic algorithm agility, at least the support of SHA-2 and
   the ability to indicate additional algorithms needs to be provided..

   In addition, in RSVP Cryptographic Authentication [RFC2747], three
   approaches to generating unique monotonically increasing sequence
   numbers across a failure and restart are introduced, but no approach
   is mandated.  However, as mentioned above, when using Network
   Recovered Clocks into the generation of sequence numbers, the
   capability of RSVP-TE in tolerating inter-connection replay attacks
   will largely rely on the security of network timing protocols.
   Therefore, in future this approach should not be recommended.
