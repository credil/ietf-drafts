    Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile Ring Protection
             draft-liu-mpls-tp-ring-protection-switching-00

Abstract

   according to RFC 5654 MPLS-TP Requirement, there is a paragraph for
   recovery requirements just as section 2.5.6.1 in RFC5654 describles:
   within the context of recovery in MPLS-TP networks,the optimization
   criteria considered in ring topologies are as follows: 1 minimize the
   number of OAM entities that are needed to trigger the recovery
   operation; 2 Minimize the number of elements of recovery in the ring;
   3 Minimize the number of labels required for the protection paths
   across the ring; 4 minimize the amount of control and management
   plane transactions during maintenance operation. this document will
   describle two types of ring protection solutions to implement these
   requirements.

1.  Introduction

   this draft mainly describes two ring protection solutions, solution 1
   will use one protecting SPME to protect one working SPME when there
   is a defect on the working SPME. while solution 2 will use one
   protecting LSP to protect one working LSP.They are similar to 1:1
   linear protection. but the difference is the first solution may
   protect many LSP working paths of one SPME. and the second one may
   just protect one working LSP path.

3.  proposed ring protection solution

   this section mainly proposed two types of ring protection
   solution.the two ring protection solutions need to detect and notify
   the defect by OAM and APS functions,so that the source node of
   working SPME and LSP path will switch these protected services into
   protecting SPME and LSP path.but the two ring protection solutions
   also have a few differences. solution 1 provides recovery of all LSP
   services of a defective working SPME by protecting SPME ,while
   another solution just provides one dedicate protecting path for each
   working LSP path.

3.1.  solution 1

   This ring protection solution in MPLS-TP network mainly use
   protecting SPME to protect working SPME .firstly two transfer nodes
   will be selected in the ring. and the two transfer nodes would backup
   for each other to ensure to transport service under the condition
   that one prime transfer node has failure.other nodes in the ring need
   to set up two bidirectional SPME separately in the direction of
   clockwise and anticlockwise along the ring to the two transfer nodes
   ; and use CC or CV packet to detect defect on each SPME.

   when an end point of a working SPME detects a defect on its own SPME
   , it will generate a State notify message (PSC) to be sent to another
   end point of the SPME. so that the two end point can coordinate the
   switch state. and the frame format of the state notify message is the
   following 1:


        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        | 0001|  0000 |      00000000    |   channel type (PSC)     |

        |                                                           |
        |                PSC Control packet                         |
        |                                                           |

   peer end point, it would process the message and switch to its
   relative protecting SPME to transport all LSP Services of the
   defective working SPME. for example, there is the following ring
   including point A ,B, C,D,E and F .Point A and D are configured as
   two transfer nodes separately in the ring.while working and
   protecting SPME will be set up between the two transfer nodes A and D
   and other nodes include B,C,D,E,F.it will need to set up 16 SPME in
   the ring.  Just as C node, there need to set up four bidirectional
   SPME,which are separately working SPME(A-B-C) identified by signal
   (@) and protecting SPME ( A-F-E-D-C) identified by signal (#) between
   transfer node A and node C . at the same time, they are still
   including bidirectional working SPME (C-D) identified by signal(*)
   and protecting SPME(C-B-A-F-E-D) identified by signal($) between
   another transfer node D and node C, just as the following figure 2.

   supposing a LSP service from source node C to sink node E ,under
   free-defect contidion,it would push the LSP into working SPME (w)PCA|
   LC(A)|BOS firstly,then it will POP outer SPME label and swap inner
   LSP label in the transfer node A .and then push it into another SPME
   (w)PAE|LA(E)|BOS and transport it to sink node E. here PXY denotes a
   SPME from LSR-X to LSR-Y , '|' can be used to separate each level in

   for example, there is a defect on the link(C-B) just as above
   figure,all LSP services which would be carried and sent between C and
   transfer node A by working SPME(C-B-A) should switch to protecting
   SPME(C-D-E-F-A) and push it into protecting SPME(p)PCA|LC(A)|BOS and
   be transported to transfer node A if the protecting SPME has no
   failure at the same time. when it arrived at the transfer node A ,

   The outer SPME label would be popped and swap LSP label in the
   transfer node A, Then the LSP service would be pushed into another
   working SPME (w)PAE|LA(E)|BOS and be carried to sink node E .in
   addtion, when the transfer node A or the relative protecting SPME has
   failure too, another transfer node D will become transfer node for
   all LSP services which are trasfered at the transfer node A. All LSP
   services of working SPME(C-B-A) would be pushed into another working
   SPME(C-D) (w)PCD|LC(D)|BOS to be sent to backup transfer node D, and
   then POP outer SPME label and swap LSP label at the transfer node D
   .then they would be pushed into another SPME (w) PDE|LD(E)|BOS and be
   sent to sink node E.

   From the view of number of configuring SPME, if there are n nodes in
   the ring , there only need to set up and configure O(4N) SPME Tunnel.
   if configuring one working SPME and one protecting SPME between each
   node and other nodes of the ring , then there need to set up and
   configure O(n^2) SPME . so this solution maybe solve the N square
   problem.

3.2.  solution 2

   This ring protection solution can use one protecting LSP path to
   protect one working LSP path,since they are both in the same ring,
   the direction of the two LSP path is reverse in the ring. when a
   defect has been detected by section cc&cv function, a state notify
   message just as the above figure 1 will be generated and sent to all
   other nodes of the ring . when other nodes receive the state notify
   message , they would analysis which LSP service would be affected by
   the failure based by the state notify message and segment link state
   of each LSP on each node.if some working paths are affected by the
   failure, they will switch to its relative protecting path or bridge
   its service to both working path and protecting path.

3.2.1.  P2P Instance

   if the LSP service affected by the failure is P2P service in the ring
   , the source node of the LSP service would switch into its own
   protecting LSP path to transport to the egress node of the ring.
   while the egress node of the LSP service would select protecting LSP
   path to receive the service .for example , there is a LSP service
   from B to E as the following figure 4. its working LSP path is
   B-A-F-E identified by singal @, while its protecting LSP path is
   B-C-D-E identified by signal #, Under normal condition, the LSP
   service would be sent by the working LSP path(B-A-F-E).

   if there is a defect on the working LSP path. for example the link
   A-F has a defect as the following figure 5.node A or F would detect a
   defect by section CC&CV function firstly. then node A or F would
   generate state notify message and send it to all other nodes of the
   ring. when other nodes of the ring received the state notify message
   , they would process the state notify message and analysis which LSP
   service would be affected by the failure based by the state notify
   message and segment link state of each LSP which must save on both
   end node of each LSP.if the failure can change the segment link state
   of a LSP , the LSP will switch into the protecting path to transport
   service pakcet.  Just as the following link(A-F) failure, when both
   end nodes B and E of the LSP received the state notify message from
   node A or F, they firstly would locate where the failure happened by
   the two end node address of the failure in the state notify message.
   then they would judge whether to affect the segment link state of the
   LSP(B-A-F-E) which had saved on both node.if the segment link state
   of the LSP has be changed. the source node B of the LSP service would
   switch to protecting LSP path(B-C-D-E) to transport it.  At the same
   time, the sink node E of the LSP Service would select protecting LSP
   path to accept service.

   when the failure is clear, node A or F would generate state notify
   message of defect-free to all other nodes of the ring . so the source
   node B and the sink node E of the LSP service received the state
   notify message , they would still analysis which LSP service would be
   affected by state changing and adopt relative action.so they would
   restore to send and receive service packet by working lsp
   path(B-C-D-E).

3.2.2.  P2MP Instance


   For P2MP service of the ring , it must be unidirectional and more
   than one egress nodes. it is difficult for ingress node or egress
   node to judge and analysis which P2MP LSP service would need to be
   switch by the failure only by state notify message and segment link
   state of the p2mp path. . when a failure has been detected by section
   CC&CV function, the node which detects the failure would generate
   state notify message and send it to all other nodes of the ring. when
   other nodes received the state notify message,the root node of the
   P2MP service firstly bridge to the working path and the protecting
   path . so it send the service to its egress nodes by differently

   working path and protecting path.  For egress nodes of the p2mp
   service.  They will merge select one path to accept the service
   packet. when the defect is clear, the node which detects defect-free
   will generate a state notify message of defect-free and send it to
   all other nodes of the ring. all other nodes receive the state notify
   message and restore only working path to transport the service
   packet. for root node of the p2mp service, it only send p2mp service
   packet by working path. while egress nodes will only select working
   path to accept the p2mp service packet.

   for example, there is a p2mp service from source node B to egress
   nodes F and E. its working path is B-C-D-[E]-[F] identified by
   signal(#) ,and its protecting path is B-A-[F]-[E] identified by
   singal(@).under normal condition, the service pakcet will be
   transported by working path B-C-D-[E]-[F] .just as the following

   it to all other nodes of the ring . when other nodes C,B,A,F receive
   the state notify message , they will make all p2mp source services be
   sent by both working path and protecting path firstly. eg. the
   service from B to E,F , root node B send the p2mp service packet
   separately by its working path B-C-D-[E]-[F] and its protecting path
   B-A-[F]-[E].  As there is a defect in separately C-D link and D-E
   link, for the egress nodes E and F, they will not receive service
   packet by its working path B-C-D-E-F. so they must select its
   protectiong path B-A-[F]-[E] to receive the service packet just as
