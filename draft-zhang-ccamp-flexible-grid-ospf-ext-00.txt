1. Introduction 

   [G.694.1v1] defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) 
   frequency grids for WDM applications. A frequency grid is a 
   reference set of frequencies used to denote allowed nominal central 
   frequencies that may be used for defining applications. The channel 
   spacing, i.e. the frequency spacing between two allowed nominal 
   central frequencies could be 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz, 100 GHz and 
   integer multiples of 100 GHz as defined in [G.694.1v1]. All of the 
   wavelengths on a fiber should use different central frequencies and 
   occupy a fixed bandwidth of frequency.  

   [G.FLEXIGRID], an updated version of [G.694.1v1] will be consented 
   in December 2011 in support of flexible-grids. The terms "frequency 
   slot (The frequency range allocated to a channel and unavailable to 
   other channels within a flexible-grid)" and "slot width" (the full 
   width of a frequency slot in a flexible-grid) are introduced to 
   address flexible-grids. A channel is represented as a LSC (Lambda

   Switching Capable) LSP in the control plane, i.e. a LSC LSP should 
   occupy a frequency slot on each fiber it traverses. In the case of 
   flexible-grid, different LSC LSPs may have different slot width on a 
   fiber, i.e. the slot width is flexible on a fiber.  

   [WSON-OSPF] defines the OSPF-TE extensions for WSON networks, which 
   focuses on the fixed grids of DWDM. [GEN-OSPF] defines OSPF-TE 
   extensions in support of the general network element constraints   
   under the control of GMPLS. This document describes the additional 
   requirements and extensions of routing protocol brought by flexible-
   grid.  

   This document uses the fiber link model which is shown in [FLEXIBLE-
   REQ] to describe the requirement and extensions for routing. The 
   flexible-grid related terminologies can also refer to [FLEXIBLE-REQ].   

2. Terminology  

   Flexible Grid: See [FLEXIBLE-REQ]. 

   Frequency Slot Width: See [FLEXIBLE-REQ]. 

   Frequency Range: See [FLEXIBLE-REQ]. 

   SSON: Spectrum-Switched Optical Networks; See [FLEXIBLE-REQ]. 

   LSC SS-LSP or flexi-LSP (Lambda Switch Capable Spectrum-Switched 
   Label Switched Path): a control plane construct that represents a 
   data plane connection in which the switching involves a frequency 
   slot of a variable (flexible) slot width. The mapped client signal 
   is transported over the slot width, using spectrum efficient 
   modulations such as Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division 
   Multiplexing (CO-OFDM).  

3. Requirements for Flexible-grid Routing  

   As described in [FLEXIBLE-REQ], the main changes for routing brought 
   by flexible-grid are related to the DWDM links.  

3.1. Available Frequency Ranges on the Flexible-Grid DWDM Links  

   In the case of flexible-grids, the central frequency steps from 
   193.1 THz with 6.25 GHz granularity. The central frequency is 
   calculated as follows:  

   Central Frequency = 193.1 THz + n * 0.00625 THz

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-ospf-ext-00.txt            October 2011 
    

   Where n is a positive or negative integer including 0.  

   Different LSC LSPs could occupy frequency slots with different slot 
   width. The frequency slot width of a LSC LSP is defined as follows:  

              Slot width = 0.0125 THz * m  

   Where m is a positive integer.  

   The frequency slot of a LSP can be determined by the slot width and 
   central frequency as follows.  

   Lowest frequency = (central frequency) - (slot width)/2 

                    = (193.1 + n * 0.00625) - (0.0125 * m)/2 

                    = (193.1 + (n - m) * 0.00625) THz; 

   Highest frequency = (central frequency) + (slot width)/2  

                    = (193.1 + n * 0.00625) + (0.0125 * m)/2 

                    = (193.1 + (n + m) * 0.00625) THz; 

   On a DWDM link, the frequency slots must not overlap with each other. 
   However, the border frequencies of two frequency slots may be the 
   same frequency, i.e. the highest frequency of a frequency slot may 
   be the lowest frequency of the next frequency slot.

   Figure 1 shows two adjacent frequency slots on a link. The highest 
   frequency of frequency slot 1 denoted by n=2 is the lowest frequency

   of slot 2. In this example, it means that the frequency range from 
   n=-2 to n=10 is occupied and is unavailable to other LSC LSPs.  

   Hence, the available frequency ranges should be advertised for the 
   flexible-grid DWDM links. A set of non-overlapping available 
   frequency ranges SHOULD be disseminated in order to allow efficient 
   resource management of Flexible-grid DWDM links and RSA procedures 
   which are described in section 4 of [FLEXIBLE-REQ]. 

3.2. Comparison with Fixed-grid DWDM Links  

   In case of fixed-grid DWDM links, each wavelength has a pre-defined 
   central frequency and all the wavelengths occupy the same frequency 
   range (channel spacing). Hence all the wavelengths in the DWDM links 
   can be identified uniquely and the status (available or not) of the 
   wavelengths can be advertised through routing protocol.  

        W(-2)  |    W(-1)  |    W(0)   |    W(1)   |     W(2)  | 
   ...---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----... 
   50 GHz  |   50 GHz  |  50 GHz   |  50 GHz   |   50 GHz  |  
    
       n=-2        n=-1        n=0         n=1         n=2               
   ...---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------... 
                                 ^              
                    Central F = 193.1THz     
    
      Figure 2 - A Link supports Fixed Wavelengths with 50 GHz Channel 
                                 Spacing 
    
   Figure 2 shows a link that supports fixed-grid with 50 GHz channel 
   spacing. The central frequencies of the wavelengths are pre-defined 
   by 'n' and each wavelength occupies a fixed 50 GHz frequency range 
   as described in [G.694.1v1].  

   Different from the fixed-grid DWDM links, the slot width of the 
   wavelengths are flexible on a flexible-grid DWDM link as described 
   in section 2.1, i.e., the value of m in the formula is uncertain 
   before a frequency slot is allocated. So, the available frequency 
   ranges instead of the specific "wavelengths" should be advertised 
   for a flexible-grid DWDM link. 

4. Extensions  

   As described in [FLEXIBLE-REQ], the network connectivity topology 
   constructed by the links/nodes and node capabilities are the same as

   WSON which can be advertised by GMPLS routing protocol (refer to 
   section 6.2 of [RFC6163].  In case of flexible-grid, the available 
   frequency ranges instead of the specific ''wavelengths'' should be 
   advertised for the link, which is different from the fixed grid DWDM. 
   This section defines the GMPLS OSPF-TE extensions in support of 
   advertising the available frequency ranges for the flexible-grid 
   DWDM links.  

4.1. Available Labels Set sub-TLV  

   As described in section 2.1, the available frequency ranges other 
   than the available frequency slots should be advertised for the 
   flexible-grid DWDM links. The Available Labels Set sub-TLV defined 
   in [GEN-OSPF] can be re-used to advertise the available frequency 
   ranges for the flexible-grid DWDM links.  

   To make the encoding efficiently, the inclusive/exclusive label 
   ranges format of Available Labels Set sub-TLV defined in [GEN-OSPF] 
   can be used for specifying the frequency ranges of the flexible-grid 
   DWDM links.

   Note that it needs multiple Available Labels Set sub-TLVs if there 
   are multiple discontinuous frequency ranges on a link. 

   The fields of Start Label and End Label specify the lowest frequency 
   and highest frequency of a frequency range. The label format defined 
   in [FLEXIBLE-SIG] shown below can be used to encode the Start Label 
   and End Label:

   In case of Grid=1 (ITU-T DWDM), a new value of C.S. is defined for 
   flexible 6.25 GHz grid.  

   If the C.S. is 6.25 GHz in an Available Labels Set sub-TLV, it means 
   that the corresponding link supports flexible-grid and the Start 
   Label/End Label specifies the frequency range of the link.  

   [Editors' Note: the other formats of Label set (e.g., 
   Inclusive/Exclusive Label Lists and Bitmap Label Set) can also be 
   used to specify the frequency ranges for the flexible-grid DWDM 
   links.]

   Figure 3 shows an example of a flexible-grid DWDM link which is 
   traversed by two LSC LSPs.

   The available frequency resource of the link could be advertised as 
   follows:  

   <Available Labels> sub-TLV: 

   o Exclusive Range 1: [Start label = 193.1 + (-2)*0.00625,

                          End Label = 193.1 + 10*0.00625] 

   It is noted that the central frequency denoted by n=3 is available 
   for a LSC LSP with 12.5 GHz slot width request but unavailable for a 
   LSC LSP with a wider slot width request.

   o If a LSC LSP which requires a 12.5 GHz width frequency slot is 
      requested on this link, the central frequency denoted by n=3 is 
      available because the corresponding frequency slot [n=2, n=4] dose 
      not overlap the existing LSPs (the unavailable frequency ranges is

   o If a LSC LSP which requires a 25 GHz width frequency slot is 
      requested on this link, the central frequency denoted by n=3 is

      overlaps the unavailable central frequencies (the unavailable

   The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of   
   any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be   
   claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology   
   described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license   
   under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it   
   represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any   
   such rights. 

   Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF   
   Secretariat and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or   
   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or   
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or   
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line 
   IPR   repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr 

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any   
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary   
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement   
   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please   
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org. 

   The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or   
   under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are   
   published by third parties, including those that are translated into   
   other languages, should not be considered to be definitive versions   
   of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions   
   is that published by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions 
   of   these Legal Provisions that are published by third parties, 
   including   those that are translated into other languages, should 
   not be   considered to be definitive versions of these Legal 
   Provisions. 

   For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards   
   Process licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of   
   the IETF Standards Process to the IETF Trust pursuant to the   
   provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms,   
   conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the   
   rights and licenses granted under RFC 5378, shall have any effect 
   and   shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such   
   Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.
