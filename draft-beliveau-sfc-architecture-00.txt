Internet-Draft              SFC architecture                October 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an architecture for Service Function Chaining
   (SFC).  It describes components and architecture principles to
   provide Service Function Chaining in a network.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   Service Function(SF):  An application or service which performs
      specific treatments when packets traverses it.  A non-exhaustive
      list of Service Functions include: firewall (e.g.,[RFC6092]), DPI
      (Deep Packet Inspection), NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146],
      HOST_ID injection, HTTP Header Enrichment function, load-balancer,
      etc.  The exact definition of each Service Function is specifc to
      each Service Function provider.

   Service Function Identity(SF-ID):  A unique identifier which
      represents each SF in a network.  SF-ID is unique within each SFC
      network and does not need to be globally unique.  Even if multiple
      instances of the same Service Function are available in an SFC
      network, the same SF-ID is used to identify the Service Function.

   Service Function Locator(SF-Loc):  A unique name or address which
      identifies each Service Function.  When multiple instances of the
      same Service Function are available in an SFC network, each
      instance has its own Service Function Locator.

   Service Function Chain (SFC):  An ordered list of SF which should be
      traversed.

   Service Function Chain Identity (SC-ID):  A unique identifier which
      represents each SFC in a network.  SC-ID is unique within each SFC
      network and does not need to be globally unique.

   Service Function Chain Enforcement Point (SCEP):  A node which is
      able to guarantee that a list of SF will be traversed in a
      specific order for flows which are associated with such SF chain.

   Service Chaining Infrastructure Network (SC-IN):  is formed by a one
      or more SCEP nodes connected together.

   Service Chaining Classification Function (SC-CL):  A logical function
      part of a SCEP node.  SC-CL is mandatory to execute when packets
      enter the SC-IN (ingress).

Internet-Draft              SFC architecture                October 2013


   Service Chaining Forwarding Function (SC-FWD):  A logical function
      part of a SCEP node.  It is responsible for forwarding packets to
      SF, forwarding packets to other SCEP nodes and to remove SC-IN
      specific information from packets when exiting (egress) SC-IN.
      SC-FWD is mandatory in all SCEP nodes.

   Service Function Path:  Specific path taken by packets through SC-IN.
      Service Function Path includes specific SCEP nodes and SF nodes
      traversed by an individual flow.


3.  Architecture principles

3.1.  Introduction

   The concept of Service Function Chaining consists of applying a
   number of Service Functions in a specific order.  The proposed
   architecture for Service Function Chaining ties together four
   different mechanisms to guarantee the execution of Service Functions
   in a specifc order.

   Those four separate mechanisms are:

   o  A mechanism to specify a Service Function Chain (SFC) as an
      ordered list of Service Functions.

   o  A mechanism to deliver packets between SF instances in the
      specified order: Service Chaining Infrastructure (SC-IN).

   o  A mechanism to specify which packets should be associated with a
      specific Service Function Chain: SFC classification.

   o  A mechanism to support scaling in/out the number of instances of
      each SF.

3.2.  Service Function Chain

   A Service Function Chain (SFC) consists of an ordered list of Service
   Function (SF).  Each SF is defined by an identifier which is unique
   within an administrative domain (SF-ID).  No IANA registry is
   required to store the identity of SFs.

   Multiple Service Function Chains can exist in the same administrative
   domain.  Each Service Function Chain (SFC) is defined by an
   identifier which is unique within an administrative domain (SC-ID).
   No IANA registry is required to store the identity of Service
   Function Chains.

   As no information about topology, SF classification or SF scaling is
   represented in the SF chain definition therefore, Service Function
   Chains are independent from changes in topology, classification or
   scaling instances of a Service Function.

   Here is a some examples of Service Function Chains:


             +----------+  +----------+  +----------+  +----------+
             |   Load   |  |   Web    |  |   Fire   |  |          |
    SFC-ID=1 | Balancer |--|  Proxy   |--|   wall   |--|  NAT44   |
             | SF-ID=1  |  | SF-ID=2  |  | SF-ID=3  |  |  SF-ID=4 |
             +----------+  +----------+  +----------+  +----------+

             +----------+  +----------+  +----------+
             |          |  | Header   |  |   Fire   |
    SFC-ID=2 |   DPI    |--| enrichm. |--|   wall   |
             | SF-ID=6  |  | SF-ID=5  |  | SF-ID=3  |
             +----------+  +----------+  +----------+

                 Figure 1: Service Function Chain examples

3.3.  Service Chaining Infrastructure

   The Service Chaining Infrastructure (SC-IN) consists of Service
   Chaining Enforcement Points (SCEP) and Service Functions
   interconnected as a network.  An SCEP node contains a forwarding
   function (SC-FWD) and optionally a classification function (SC-CL).

   Service Chaining Infrastructure (SC-IN) is illustrated in Figure 2.

                 Figure 2: Service Chaining Infrastructure

   SCEP can directly reach other SCEP nodes within the SC-IN.  Service
   Functions (SF) are directly connected to an SCEP.  To enforce the
   execution of SF in the specified order, Service Functions (SF) cannot
   communicate directly between eachother without going through an SCEP.
   One or many SFs can be attached to the same SCEP.

   When entering an SC-IN, an ingress SCEP which contains an SC-CL will
   map packets into a specific Service Function Path.  Once this mapping
   is done, the SC-FWD will determine the locator for the next SF on the
   Service Function Path and forward the packet to the SF to be invoked.

3.4.  Service Function scaling

   Multiple instances of the same Service Function can exist in the
   SC-IN.  Each new instances of a SF, when created, will be attached to
   an SCEP in the SC-IN and a unique locator (SF-Loc) will be allocated
   to it.

   When instances of a Service Function needs to be removed, the Service
   Function Controller will ensure that no packet can be forwarded to
   the instance of Service Function to be removed.  Once done, the
   Service Function instance can be removed.

3.5.  Service Function Classification

   In order to direct specific packets to follow a certain Service
   Function Path, SC-CL will analyse the packet headers and determine
   which Service Function Path should be followed.  A Service Function
   Path is a list of Service Function locators (SF-Loc) for the specific
   instances of SF which constitutes a SFC.

   Once the Service Function Path is determined, the Service Chaining
   Forwarding function (SC-FWD) will determine the next Service Function
   and forward the traffic to it.

3.6.  Service Chaining Controller

   The Service Function Chaining Controller is responsible to configure
   SCEP nodes in the Service Chaining Infrastructure.  It is the
   controller which ties together Service Function Chains/Paths, the
   topology of the Service Chaining Infrastructure, the locating
   information of SF instances as they are being scaled in/out and
   Service Chaining Classification rules.

   It is responsible to guarantee the consistency of the configuration
   of SCEP across the SC-IN.  Service Chaining Controller is illustrated
   in Figure 3.

6.  Security Considerations

   SFC must address at least the following security considerations:

   o  Secure and authenticate communication between controller and SCEP
      nodes

   o  Authenticate communication between SF and SCEP node.

   o  Isolate SC-IN network when infrastructure is shared with nodes
      which are not SCEP nodes.

   o  Protect interface at border of SC-IN (ingress/egress SCEP) against
      fraudulent usage.

   o  Protect SFC specific protocol/metadata information against
      fraudulent usage.

   o  When an SCEP participate in multiple networks, isolation between
      them.

   o  Protect interface between SF and SCEP node against fraudulent
      usage.
