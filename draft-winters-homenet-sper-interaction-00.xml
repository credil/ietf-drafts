This document describes the interaction between a Service Provider Gateway fixed at the home edge, and the Home Networking interior routers. Assessing the interactions between existing routers implementing 6204bis and the Home Networking routers. The document will also define the interactions with the HIPnet edge router and Home Networking router.      </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
       This document defines the interactions between the future Homenet network and 6204bis Routers and HIPnet routers.  Currently 6204bis and HIPnet routers are being deployed by ISPs as Service Provider Edge Routers (SPER) for IPv6 deployment.  In the future the SPER will be a full Homenet routers but there will be a period of transition.
       This document specifies how currently deployed SPER will interact with Homenet architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-homenet-arch"></xref>.  Identifying the effects of key components of the architecture.  The goal of this document is to make recommendations on issues uncovered to make the devices work with the future Homenet.

       <t>In this section we define terminology and abbreviations used throughout the text.
       <list style="symbols">
             <t> Border: a point, typically resident on a router, between two networks, e.g. between the main internal homenet and a guest network.  This defines point(s) at which filtering and forwarding policies for different types of traffic may be applied </t>

             <t> Homenet: A home network, comprising host and router equipment, with one or more SPERs providing connectivity to service provider network(s). </t>
             <t> Internet Service Provider (ISP): an entity that provides access to the Internet.  In this document, a service provider specifically offers Internet access using IPv6, and may also offer IPv4 Internet access.  The service provider can provide such access over a variety of different transport methods such as DSL, cable, wireless, and others. </t>

    </section>
    <section title="6204bis Service Provider Edge Router (SPER)">
         <section title="Addressing">
              <t>
              A 6204bis SPER acquire LAN addressing thru DHCP Prefix Delegation <xref target='RFC3633'></xref>. A 6204bis SPER will 
              assign a separate /64 from the delegated prefix(es) for each LAN interface.   The 6202bis SPER can assign address 
              either thru SLAAC or DHCP to LAN host.   There is no mechanism for delegating any unused prefix(es) that were delegated
              to the 6204bis Router. 
              </t>
         </section>
         <section title="Routing">
              <t>
              A 6204bis SPER is capable of learning default routes thru Router Advertisement on the WAN interface.  All other routing
              information is learned when a prefix is assigned to a LAN interface by the 6204bis SPER.  All other Routing information
              is learned from other methods such as user configuration.
	      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              The 6204bis SPER will NOT forward packets from an unrecognized source address.   Any IPv6 packets routed from the Homenet would receive an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message.   A 6204bis SPER prevents any Routing mechanisms from working.
	      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              </t>
         </section>
         <section title="Security">
              <t>A 6204 SPER is recommended to enable a stateful <xref target='RFC6092'></xref> firewall by default.  This stateful firewall will allow
              the homenet incoming traffic is limited to return traffic resulting from outgoing packets.
              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              A Homenet Router with the firewall on might not allow valid traffic from devices connected to the 6204bis SPER.  When a Homenet Router detects a 6204bis SPER it should
              allow native IPv6 traffic thru the firewall so that traffic can flow between the 6204bis SPER and Homenet.   
              </t>
         </section>
         <section title="Naming and Service Discovery">
              <t>
              A 6204bis SPER support the ability to assign DNS servers and Domain Search List.  A 6204bis SPER may support 
              service discovery protocols such as mDNS/DNS-SD and SSDP.  These protocols will only work when directly connected to 
              the 6204 SPER LAN interfaces.   There is currently no mechanism for sharing service discovery between the Homenet and IPv6 nodes connected to the LAN interfaces of the 6204 SPER.

    <section title="HIPnet Server Provider Edge Router (SPER)">
         <section title="Addressing">
              <t> HIPnet SPER use DHCPv6 prefix sub-delegation to build the network <xref target="I-D.grundemann-homenet-hipnet"></xref>
              .  The HIPnet SPER receives IPv6 prefix per <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-6204bis"></xref>.  If the prefix is larger then a 
              single /64 prefix the HIPnet router will subdivide the IPv6 prefix received via DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.  Using
              Recursive Prefix Delegation allows the Homenet to receive prefixes that can be used to address the network.

         </section>
         <section title="Routing">
              <t>Leveraging the recursive prefix delegation method described above, a HIPnet SPER installs route to the WAN interface of the router delegated the prefixes.  With this routing information the HIPnet SPER is able to properly route packets to and from the Homenet.

              A Homenet Router with the firewall on might not allow valid traffic from devices connected to the HIPnet SPER.  When a Homenet Router detects a HIPnet SPER it should

         </section>
         <section title="Naming and Service Discovery">
              <t> 
              Both the Homenet and HIPnet have several common protocols that can be used for service discovery such as <xref target='RFC6762'>mDNS</xref>, 
              <xref target='RFC6763'>DNS-SD</xref>, and SSDP.   Both the HIPnet and Homenet Routers may have host directly connected that are using them as DNS servers.  
              If the HIPnet SPER advertises itself as the DNS-SD server for connected host, the host could query the HIPnet SPER.   The issue that arises with this 
              configuration is the HIPnet Router currently has no method for finding the Homenet router to query when trying to resolve DNS.   
              Future revisions of this draft should try and resolve this issue.
