 Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Uniform Resource Identifiers
                draft-petithuguenin-behave-turn-uris-04

Abstract

   This document specifies the syntax of Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) schemes for the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN)
   protocol.  It defines two URI schemes that can be used to provision
   the configuration values needed by the resolution mechanism defined
   in [RFC5928].

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Traversal Using Relays
   around NAT (TURN) protocol.

   The TURN protocol is a specification allowing hosts behind NAT to
   control the operation of a relay server.  The relay server allows
   hosts to exchange packets with its peers.  The peers themselves may
   also be behind NATs.  RFC 5766 [RFC5766] defines the specifics of the
   TURN protocol.

   The "turn" and "turns" URI schemes are used to designate a TURN
   server (also known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible using the

Internet-Draft                 TURN URIs                        May 2013


   TURN protocol.  With the advent of standards such as [WEBRTC], we
   anticipate a plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to
   identify and communicate with such a TURN server to carry out the
   TURN protocol.  This also implies those endpoints and/or applications
   to be provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify
   the TURN server.  Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and
   can result in non-interoperable solutions.  It can result in
   solutions that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on
   the different aspects of the syntax and alike.  The "turn/turns" URI
   scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent
   way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a
   TURN server.  This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with
   encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones
   proposed in [WEBRTC], for example.

   [RFC5928] defines a resolution mechanism to convert a secure flag, a
   host name or IP address, an eventually empty port, and an eventually
   empty transport to a list of IP address, port, and TURN transport
   tuples.

   To simplify the provisioning of TURN clients, this document defines a
   TURN and a TURNS URI scheme that can carry the four components needed
   for the resolution mechanism.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Definitions of the TURN and TURNS URI

3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The "turn" URI takes the following form (the syntax below is non-
   normative):

      turn:<host>:<port>

      turns:<host>:<port>

   Note that the <port> part and the preceding ":" (colon) character, is
   OPTIONAL.

   A TURN/TURNS URI has the following formal ABNF syntax [RFC5234]:

   turnURI       = scheme ":" turn-host [ ":" turn-port ]
                   [ "?transport=" transport ]
   scheme        = "turn" / "turns"

Internet-Draft                 TURN URIs                        May 2013


   transport     = "udp" / "tcp" / transport-ext
   transport-ext = 1*unreserved
   turn-host     = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
   turn-port     = *DIGIT
   IP-literal    = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"
   IPvFuture     = "v" 1*HEXDIG "." 1*( unreserved / sub-delims / ":" )
   IPv6address   =                              6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   /                       "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                   / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                   / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                   / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"
   h16           = 1*4HEXDIG
   ls32          = ( h16 ":" h16 ) / IPv4address
   IPv4address   = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
   dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                   / %x31-39 DIGIT       ; 10-99
                   / "1" 2DIGIT          ; 100-199
                   / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT   ; 200-249
                   / "25" %x30-35        ; 250-255
   reg-name      = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )


   <unreserved>, <sub-delims>, and <pct-encoded> are specified in
   [RFC3986].  The core rules <DIGIT> and <HEXDIGIT> are used as
   described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

   The <host>, <port> and <transport> components are passed without
   modification to the [RFC5928] algorithm.  <secure> is set to false if
   <scheme> is equal to "turn" and set to true if <scheme> is equal to
   "turns" and passed to the [RFC5928] algorithm with the other
   components.

3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The TURN protocol supports sending messages over UDP, TCP or TLS-
   over-TCP.  The "turns" URI scheme MUST be used when TURN is run over
   TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP) and the "turn" scheme
   MUST be used otherwise.

   The required <host> part of the "turn" URI denotes the TURN server
   host.

   The <port> part, if present, denotes the port on which the TURN
   server is awaiting connection requests.  If it is absent, the default

   port is 3478 for both UDP and TCP.  The default port for TURN over
   TLS is 5349.

4.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
   [RUNNING-CODE].  According to [RUNNING-CODE], "this will allow
   reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents
   that have the benefit of running code, by considering the running
   code as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that has
   made the implemented protocols more mature.  It is up to the
   individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".

Appendix B.  Release notes

   This section must be removed before publication as an RFC.

B.1.  Design Notes

   o  One recurring comment was to stop using the suffix "s" on URI
      scheme, and to move the secure option to a parameter (e.g.
      ";proto=tls").  We decided against this idea because the STUN URI
      does not have a ";proto=" parameter and we would have lost the
      symmetry between the TURN and STUN URIs.  A more detailed account
      of the reasoning behind this is available at <http://blog.marc
      .petit-huguenin.org/2012/09/on-design-of-stun-and-turn-uri-
      formats.html>

   o  Following the advice of RFC 4395 section 2.2., and because the
      TURN URI does not describe a hierarchical structure, the TURN URIs
      are opaque URIs.

Internet-Draft                 TURN URIs                        May 2013


   o  <password> is not used in the URIs because it is deprecated.
      <username> is not used in the URIs because it is not used to guide
      the resolution mechanism.

   o  As discussed in Dublin, there is no generic parameters in the URI
      to prevent compatibility issues.

B.2.  Modifications between petithuguenin-behave-turn-uris-04 and
      petithuguenin-behave-turn-uris-03

   o  Added implementation status (from draft-sheffer-running-code) for
      turnuri, Chromium and Firefox.
