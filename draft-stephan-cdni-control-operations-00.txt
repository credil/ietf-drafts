Abstract

   This memo discusses the role of the CDNI control interface and
   proposes a framework clarifying the control operations for CDNI.

   It does not make any assumption about the protocol implementation,
   which may be either manual or automated.  Furthermore, both uCDN and
   dCDN could initiate Control operations.

Internet-Draft           CDNI Control Operations           November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The CDNI control Interface is introduced by [RFC6707] along with the
   CDNI Metadata, CDNI Request Routing, CDNI Acquisition and CDNI
   Logging interfaces.  Then [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] specifies the
   high-level functions performed by each of the CDNI interfaces and the
   relationships between them.  It defines the role of the CDNI control
   interface as encompassing "the operations to discover, initialize,
   and parameterize the other CDNI interfaces, as well as operations to
   pre-position, revalidate, and purge both metadata and content."

   Nevertheless [RFC6707] indicates that the "exact inter-CDN control
   functionality required to be supported by the CDNI Control interface
   is less well defined than the other three CDNI interfaces", and
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] reports that "There is some ambiguity as to
   the line between the set of trigger-based operations in the CDNI
   Control interface and the Metadata interface".  The present memo
   proposes to fill this gap.  It discusses the role of the CDNI control
   interface and proposes a framework for working out the specification
   of the control operations for CDNI.

1.1.  Terminology

   The reader must be familiar with the terminology given by [RFC6707]
   and by the drafts [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements] and
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework].

   Following are terms and abbreviations introduced in the document:

      Control Parameter: A parameter whose value may be exchanged for
      controlling the configuration of the CDNI interfaces;

      Control Operation: The exchange of messages for discovering,
      initializing, and parameterizing a CDNI interface.

      Bootstrapping: A control operation allowing the exchange of the
      Parameters required to establish the connectivity between servers
      which enforce the CDNI interfaces, including security aspects like
      server authentication, encryption, etc.

      Class-of-requests: A Class-of-requests identifies a set of content
      Requests, related to a specific CSP, received from clients in a
      given footprint and sharing common properties.  These properties
      include:

      *  Any header, URL parameter, query parameter of an applicative
         content request (e.g. of an HTTP content request)

Internet-Draft           CDNI Control Operations           November 2012


      *  Any header, or sub-domain of the FQDN of a DNS lookup request

      Examples:

      *  Class-of-Requests = all the requests that include the HTTP
         header "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" related to CSP
         "http://*.cdn.example.com" from AS3215

      *  Class-of-Requests = all the DNS requests from anywhere and
         related to CSP "cdn*.example.com"

      Delivery Service: A Delivery Service is defined by a set of Class-
      of-Requests, related to a given CSP, and a list of parameters that
      apply to all these Class-of-Requests (logging format, delivery
      quality/capabilities requirements...)

      Service Agreement: A service agreement is defined by a uCDN
      identifier, a dCDN identifier, a set of Delivery Services and a
      list of parameters that apply to the Service Agreement.

      Once a Service Agreement is agreed between the administrative
      entities managing the CDNs to be interconnected, the upstream CDN
      and the downstream CDN of the CDN interconnection must be
      configured according to this agreed Service Agreement.  For
      instance, a given uCDN (uCDN1) may request a given dCDN (dCDN1) to
      configure one Delivery Service for handling content requests for
      HTTP Adaptive streaming videos delegated by uCDN1 and related to a
      specific CSP (CSP1) and another one for handling content requests
      for static pictures delegated by uCDN1 and related to CSP1.  These
      Delivery services would belong to the Service Agreement between
      uCDN1 and dCDN1 for CSP1.  In this simple example, uCDN1 may
      request dCDN1 to include Delivery Service information in its CDNI
      Logging, to help uCDN1 to provide relevant reports to CSP1.

      CDNI Entity: we call CDNI Entity the end-point of a CDNI
      interface.


2.  The role of the CDNI Control Interface

   This section discusses the role of the CDNI Control interface.

   The [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] defines the role of the CDNI control
   interface as:

   o  "the operations to discover, initialize, and parameterize the
      other CDNI interfaces" which are: CDNI request Routing, metadata
      and Logging.

Internet-Draft           CDNI Control Operations           November 2012


      *  The CDNI Control interface has the responsibility of
         bootstrapping the other CDNI interfaces, and of updating or
         deleting instances of the other CDNI interfaces.

   o  "as well as operations to pre-position, revalidate, and purge both
      metadata and content".

      *  This is the role of the "trigger" interface which
         specifications are still work in progress in the draft
         document[I-D.murray-cdni-triggers].

2.1.  Pre-position,revalidate and purge metadata and content

   Operations to pre-position, revalidate, and purge both metadata and
   content are defined in the draft document [I-D.murray-cdni-triggers].
   That draft document [I-D.murray-cdni-triggers] defines a "message
   flow for trigger" based on a RESTfull web services, and specific
   metadata related activities an upstream CDN can trigger.

   The "message flow for trigger" allows:

   o  The upstream CDN to trigger activity in downstream CDN ;

   o  The upstream CDN to discover the status of the activity.

   The activities an upstream CDN can trigger in the downstream CDN and
   defined in [I-D.murray-cdni-triggers] are all dedicated to operations
   on content objects and content metadata:

   o  Fetch metadata from uCDN or content from any origin server
      including uCDN (preposition) ;

   o  Revalidate specific metadata or content before re-using it
      (invalidate) ;

   o  Delete specific metadata or content purge.

   The interface specified in the draft "CDN Interconnect triggers"
   [I-D.murray-cdni-triggers] should not be part of the CDNI control
   interface.  The main raison is that the trigger interface itself need
   to be bootstrapped (which is the role of the CDNI control interface).

   There are also other reasons, including the following ones:

   o  Parameters needed to bootstrap a CDNI interface are static, while
      trigger-based operations are dynamic ;

Internet-Draft           CDNI Control Operations           November 2012


   o  All trigger activities defined in [I-D.murray-cdni-triggers] are
      specific to metadata ;

   o  The CDN entities for (i.e. the "extremities" of) the CDNI control
      interface and for the CDNI trigger interface are not necessary the
      same.

2.2.  Bootstrapping of the other CDNI interfaces

   When an upstream CDN operator wants to delegate to a downstream CDN
   operator the handling of the content requests belonging to a given
   set of class-of-requests, the uCDN and dCDN establish a Service
   Agreement.  The Service Agreement includes all information required
   to set up the CDN interconnection.  This Service Agreement can be
   specified with a hierarchical datamodel, as depicted in Figure 1:

   o  A service agreement includes an identifier of uCDN, an identifier
      of dCDN, one or several delivery services, and a set of control
      parameters that apply to all these delivery services.  For
      example, let us consider a service agreement that includes two
      delivery services: a former one corresponding to a Vod application
      with "premium" delivery requirements, and a latter one
      corresponding to a Vod application with "standard" delivery
      requirements ;

   o  Each Delivery service associates one or several Class-of-requests
      from the same CSP with a set of control parameters that apply to
      all these Class-of-requests.  To continue with the example
      introduced just above, let us consider that the delivery service
      corresponding to the Vod application with "premium" delivery
      requirements include two different class-of-requests: a former one
      corresponding to all the requests from end-users based in France
      for http://*.cdn.example.com, and a latter one corresponding to
      all the requests from end-users in France for
      rtmp://*.cdn.example.com ;

   o  Each Class-of-requests identifies uniquely a set of requests with
      a given footprint and specific properties.  In the example
      introduced just above, one of the considered class-of-request
      corresponds to all the requests from end-users based in France for
      http://*.cdn.example.com.  And another one corresponds to all the
      requests from end-users in France for rtmp://*.cdn.example.com ;

   Once a Service Agreeement is agreed between the operators of the CDNs
   to be interconnected, the upstream CDN and the downstream CDN must be
   configured for this CDNI interconnection according to the agreed
   Service Agreement.  Namely, CDNI Request Routing interface, CDNI
   metadata interface, CDNI logging interface and CDNI "trigger"
   interface must be bootstrapped according to the Service Agreeement.


3.  CDNI Control Framework

   The CDNI control operations can possibly be performed either manually
   or via some automated network protocols; it means the CDNI control
   interface can possibly be implemented manually or via some automated
   network protocols.  Moreover, only a part of these operations are
   handled by the CDNI control interface.  The other operations are
   handled directly by the other CDNI interfaces (namely CDNI request
   routing, CDNI metadata, CDNI logging, CDNI acquisition and CDNI
   trigger interfaces).

   As described in Figure 1, the scope of a Control Operation according
   to a Control Parameter value may cover either all the Delivery
   Services of a Service agreement or a single Delivery Service.  As an
   example, the configuration of the format of Logging records may apply
   to a single Delivery Service.  Furthermore, nothing precludes Control
   Parameters associated to a set of Class-of-requests to change.  For
   instance, an uCDN could require the dCDN to use two Logging formats
   for a given Delivery Service: one for the normal mode of operations
   and one temporarily for debugging the CDN interconnection.

3.1.  CDNI Control Operations

   The enforcement of a Service Agreeement requires the configuration of
   each CDNI functional interface (i.e., including CDNI Metadata, CDNI
   Logging and CDNI Request Routing).

   The value of the Control Parameters is expected to change rarely for
   a given Delivery Service.  The core Control Operations are the
   following:

   1.  The configuration of the CDNI interfaces ;

   2.  The removal of this configuration when it is not required anymore
       (e.g., end of the scheduling of the considered Delivery Service).

   We illustrate Control Operations on Figure 2.  The two CDNs exchange
   the control parameters previously agreed by the operators of the
   CDNs.  Then, each CDN uses these control parameters to configure all
   the required CDNI interfaces appropriatly.

3.2.  Control Parameters

   It is in the scope of the CDNI Control interface specification to
   define the minimal set of Control Parameters required for
   initializing each CDNI interface for a given Service Agreement.

   Subsequent sections introduce the information to exchange through the
   CDNI Control interface to initialize each CDNI interface for a given
   Service Agreement, a given Delivery Service and a given Class-of-
   request.

3.2.1.  Service Agreement level

   This section introduces the information to exchange through the CDNI
   Control interface to initialize each CDNI interface for a given
   Service Agreement.

   o  Service Agreement identifier;

   o  uCDN identifier;

   o  dCDN identifier;

   o  List of Delivery Service identifier;

         Section Section 3.2.2 introduces information to exchange
         through the CDNI Control interface to initialize each CDNI
         interface for a given Delivery Service

   o  Connectivity and security control parameters;

         Section Section 3.2.1.1 lists information to exchange through
         the CDNI Control interface to establish a secure connectivity
         among CDNI entities.

   o  Redirection control parameters

         Section Section 3.2.1.2 lists information to exchange through
         the CDNI Control interface to redirect Class-of-requests of a
         given Service Agreeement.

3.2.1.1.  Connectivity and security control parameters

   A CDNI Entity acts as the end point for a CDNI interface.  A minimal
   set of information must be exchanged via the control interface to
   enable the connectivity and the security among CDNI entities.

   As an example securing a CDNI logging interface using HTTPS requires
   the exchange of certificates between the interconnected CDNs:

   1.  Certificate identifying dCDN's CDNI logging entity;

   2.  Certificate identifying uCDN's CDNI logging entity;

   3.  Certificate of the authority of certification;

   A CDN having an CDNi entity (e.g.  CDNI Logging data server, CDNI
   acquisition server) protected by a firewall with strict access rules
   must add the IP addresses of the entities of the other CDNs which are

Internet-Draft           CDNI Control Operations           November 2012


   allowed to connect to this entity.  As examples:

   o  When a uCDN has a dedicated CDNI acquisition server protected by a
      firewall the dCDN must provide the uCDN with the addresses of each
      dCDN content servers that could acquire content from this CDNI
      acquisition server;

   o  When the CDNI Logging Server of a dCDN is protected by a firewall
      the uCDN must provide the uCDN with the addresses of the uCDN
      entities which might access to CDNI logging information on the
      dCDN Logging server;

   Subsequent sections give an overview of the security Control
   Parameters related to each CDNI interface (CDNI Logging, CDNI Request
   Routing, CDNI Metadata and CDNI Triggers)

3.2.1.1.1.  Triggers

   We list below the pieces of information required for the
   bootstrapping of the triggers interface for a given Service
   Agreement.

   The CDNI trigger interface is a RESTful web service offered by dCDN,
   according to the draft [I-D.murray-cdni-triggers].  The CDNI Control
   interface must enable the communication of the following parameters
   from dCDN to uCDN:

   o  the uri of the CDNI trigger entity within dCDN (i.e. of the server
      within the dCDN dedicated to the CDNI trigger interface):
      URI_dCDN_trigger_server;

   o  Certificate identifying dCDN;

   o  Certificate of the authority of certification;

   According to the draft [I-D.murray-cdni-triggers], "The dCDN must
   ensure that each uCDN only has access to its own Trigger Status
   Resources and the dCDN must ensure that activity triggered by uCDN
   only affects metadata or content originating from that uCDN".
   Consequently, the CDNI Control interface must enable the dCDN to
   authenticate the uCDN.  This means the CDNI Control interface must
   enable the communication of the following parameter from uCDN to
   dCDN:

   o  Certificate identifying uCDN;

   o  Certificate of the authority of certification;

3.2.1.1.2.  CDNI Metadata

   We list below the pieces of information required for the
   bootstrapping of the CDNI Metadata interface for a given Service
   Agreement.

   According to the draft [I-D.ietf-cdni-metadata], 'If the URI for the
   HostIndex object is not manually configured in the downstream CDN
   then the HostIndex URI could be discovered via the CDNI Control
   interface.  An upstream CDN would provide the URI of the HostIndex
   object to the downstream CDN via the CDNI Control Interface.'.  In
   this second case, the CDNI Control interface must enable the
   communication of the following Control Parameters from uCDN to dCDN:

   o  the uri of the CDNI metadata entity within dCDN (i.e. of the
      server within the dCDN dedicated to the CDNI metadata interface):
      URI_uCDN_metadata_server;

   o  Certificate identifying uCDN metadata server;

   o  Certificate of the authority of certification;

   According to the draft [I-D.ietf-cdni-metadata], 'If a malicious
   metadata server is contacted by a downstream CDN, the malicious
   server may provide metadata to the downstream CDN which denies
   service for any piece of content to any user agent.  The malicious
   server may also provide metadata which directs a downstream CDN to a
   malicious origin server instead of the actual origin server.  A
   malicious metadata client could request metadata for a piece of
   content from an upstream CDN.  The metadata information may then be
   used to glean information regarding the uCDN or to contact an
   upstream origin server.  The uCDN is expected to authenticate client
   requests to prevent this situation.'  This means the CDNI Control
   interface must enable the communication of the following parameter
   from uCDN to dCDN:

   o  Certificate identifying dCDN metadata server;

   o  Certificate of the authority of certification;

3.2.1.1.3.  CDNI Logging

   We list below the pieces of information required for the
   bootstrapping of the CDNI Logging interface for a given Service
   Agreement.

   o  URI and protocol to use to request CDNI logging data;

      *  the protocol to use to exchange CDNI Logging data;

      *  etc.

   o  parameters securing the CDNI logging interface

3.2.1.1.4.  CDNI Request Routing

   We list below the pieces of information required for the
   bootstrapping of the CDNI Request Routing interface for a given
   Service Agreement.

   o  Control parameters securing the Request Routing CDNI interface

      *  Certificate identifying dCDN Request Routing/redirection CDNI
         entity;

      *  Certificate identifying uCDN Request Routing/redirection CDNI
         entity;

      *  Certificate identifying dCDN Request Routing/footprint CDNI
         entity;

      *  Certificate identifying uCDN Request Routing/footprint CDNI
         entity;

      *  Certificate of the authority of certification;

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   The bootstrapping and the configuration of the CDNI interfaces are
   very sensible operations.

   Any weakness may harm the CDN that is directly attacked, as well as
   the CDNs interconnected with it.  In addition it may endanger the
   security of the eyeballs and of the distributed content.
