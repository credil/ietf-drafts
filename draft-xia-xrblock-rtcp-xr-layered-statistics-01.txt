Internet-Draft   Layered Stream Statistics Report Blocks  September 2011


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides layered streams statistics beyond the
   information carried in the Statistics Summary Report Block RTCP
   packet specified in the section 4.6 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].
   Information is recorded about lost layered component packets,
   duplicated layered component packets.

   The metrics belong to the class of transport level metrics defined in
   [MONARCH] (work in progress).


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Layered Component Packet

      a RTP packet using layered codecs containing the specified layered
      component, e.g., encoded stream at the base layer or at the
      enhancement layer.



3.  Applicability

   Layered Streams Statistics Metrics Block can be applied to any real
   time applications that use layered or multi-description video coding.


4.  Layered Streams Statistics Metrics Block

   Metrics in this block report on lost packets, duplicated packets in
   the layered stream arriving at the RTP system.

Internet-Draft   Layered Stream Statistics Report Blocks  September 2011


4.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The report block contents are dependent upon a series of flag bits
   carried in the first part of the header.  Not all parameters need to
   be reported in each block.  Flags indicate which are and which are
   not reported.  The fields corresponding to unreported parameters MUST
   be present, but are set to zero.  The receiver MUST ignore any
   Perceptual Quality Metrics Block with a non-zero value in any field
   flagged as unreported.

   The Layered Stream Statistics metrics Block has the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

4.2.  Definition of Fields in layered stream statistics Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits
      The Layered stream Statistics Metrics Block is identified by the
      constant <LSSM>.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Basic Loss/Discard
      metrics are Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is, whether the
      reported values applies to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).

   Layer Type flag (T): 1 bit
      This field is used to indicate the Layer Type of layered video to
      be reported.  LT is set to 0 if the loss_component_packet field
      and dup_component packet contain the base layer packet in layered
      codecs,e.g, SVC in [RFC6190], 1 if the loss_component packet field
      and dup_component packet contain enhancement layer packet in
      layered codec.

Internet-Draft   Layered Stream Statistics Report Blocks  September 2011


   Layer Dependency (D): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate the layer dependency between
      different enhancement layers if there is more than one enhancement
      layers.  D is set to 0 if there is no layer dependency between
      different enhancement layers, 1 if there is layer dependency
      between different enhancement layers.

   Rsd.: 5 bits
      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Block length: 16 bits
      The constant 3, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   begin_seq: 16 bits
      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   end_seq: 16 bits
      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Lost_Layered Component Packets: 32 bits
      Number of lost_component packets in the above sequence number
      interval.

   Dup_Layered Component Packets: 32 bits
      Number of dup_component packets in the above sequence number
      interval.


5.  SDP Signaling

   One new parameter is defined for the report block defined in this
   document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].  It has the
   following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute [RFC3611]:

    rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                      [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
          xr-format = layered-stream-stat-metrics
             layered-stream-stat-metrics = "layered-stream-stat-metrics"
                                  ["=" stat-flag *("," stat-flag)]
                   stat-flag = "base layer packet"
                               / "enhancment layer packet"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description

Internet-Draft   Layered Stream Statistics Report Blocks  September 2011


   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


6.  IANA Considerations

   New report block type for RTCP XR is subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns one new block type value in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:

      Name:       LSSM
      Long Name:  Layered Stream Statistics Metrics
      Value       <LSSM>
      Reference:  Section 4

   This document also registers one new SDP [RFC4566] parameter for the
   "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:

      *  "layered-stream-stat-metrics"

   The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   The new RTCP XR report blocks proposed in this document introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
