Abstract

   This memo analyzes some port set definition algorithms used for
   stateless IPv4 to IPv6 transition technologies.  The transition
   technologies using port set algorithms can be divided into two
   categories: fully stateless approach and binding approach.  Some
   algorithms can work for both approaches.

Internet-Draft         Port Set Algorithm Analysis              May 2013


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 transition technologies with address sharing can be divided into
   three categories as suggested in [I-D.softwire-unified-cpe]:

   o  Fully stateful approach, e.g.  [RFC6333].  Stateful solutions do
      not make use of port sets, and are out of scope for this memo.

   o  Binding approach, with per-subscriber state, e.g.,
      [I-D.softwire-lw4over6].  This type of algorithm does not embed
      port set information and IPv4 address in the IPv6 address when
      doing translation or encapsulation, so a mapping entry is required
      in the border router.  This type of solution gives flexibility in
      address planning because the IPv4 address is not statically bound
      to the IPv6 address.  To some extent, the binding approach can
      also be called a partially stateless approach.

   o  Fully stateless approach, e.g., [I-D.softwire-map].  This type of
      algorithm embeds port set information and an IPv4 address in the
      IPv6 address.  For a given port number and IPv4 address, the
      corresponding IPv6 address can be calculated using a limited set
      of mapping rules rather than a mapping entry per subscriber.

   Binding and stateless technologies can significantly simplify the
   implementation of the border router and reduce resource requirements.
   In these solutions, a port set is assigned to each CPE, and can be
   calculated from a port set identifier (PSID) in conjunction with some
   other parameters.  For a given port number, the corresponding PSID
   can also be derived; that is, the mapping algorithm must be
   reversible.

   Some port set definition algorithms have been proposed to support
   these technologies.  It may be useful to analyze the characteristics
   of these algorithms for better understanding and to choose a proper
   algorithm for different needs.

   A good port set definition algorithm must be reversible and easy to
   implement.  It must be able to exclude the well-known ports (0-1023).
   It should be able to define non-continuous or random port sets for
   the modest gain in security against port-guessing attacks that these
   provide.  For the fully stateless method, the restrictions imposed by
   the algorithm on the choice of IPv6 addresses for customer equipment
   should be minimized.  To simplify administration, the total number of
   ports assigned should be roughly the same for each port set derived
   by the algorithm.  Finally, the algorithm should be adaptable to a
   wide range of address sharing ratios.

   This memo will analyze the following characteristics:

   o  Implementation: implementation complexity, performance, etc.

   o  Can calculate the port set identifier (PSID) from the port number
      at the Border Router (BR).

   o  Can exclude well known ports without excluding other ports.

   o  Port set type: continuous, non-continuous, random.  Continuous
      port set provides common security, random port set provides good
      security.

   o  Stateless: requires per-subscriber provisioning at the BR, yes or
      no.

   o  Friendliness for NAT44: comply with NAT44 [RFC5382] or not.

   o  Sharing ratio: maximum, minimum sharing ratio.


2.  Terminology

   BR:       Border Router.

   CPE:      Customer Premise Equipment.

   GMA:      Generalized Modulus Algorithm.

   MAP:      Map Address and Port.

   PSID:     Port Set Identifier, one of the key parameters used to
             derive the set of ports allocated to a given CPE.


3.  Various Types of Algorithms

3.1.  Binding Approach Algorithms

3.1.1.  Mask/Value Algorithm

   [RFC6431] defines an option for the PPP Internet Protocol Control
   Protocol (IPCP) [RFC1332] to allocate port sets to CPEs, as shown in
   Figure 1.  The Port Range Value plays the role of a PSID.  The
   example in [RFC6431] shows the case of a mask selecting a port number
   prefix, but the mask can be more general.

   [I-D.softwire-lw4over6] also uses this type of port set definition
   algorithm, for which provisioning is defined in
   [I-D.sun-dhc-port-set-option].  Figure 2 illustrates the DHCP option.

   The bit-wise AND of port set index and mask can be encoded in an IPv6
   address, which will turn it into a fully stateless solution, similar
   to parameter PSID in other technologies, e.g., MAP
   [I-D.softwire-map].

   The Port Range Value corresponding to a given port can be derived by
   performing the bit-wise AND of the port number with the Port Range
   Mask.

   This algorithm can have some kind of randomization effect by setting
   different numbers of bits and bits at different locations in the Port
   Range Mask.

   This algorithm may have a problem if the well known ports (0-1023)
   need to be excluded; it is a bit difficult to achieve that.  But if
   the operator does not have a specific usage for the well known ports,
   then it is safe to allocate those port to end users, just like other
   common ports.  Some tests have been done to confirm this.

3.1.2.  Cryptographic Algorithm

   The cryptographic port set definition algorithm introduced in
   [RFC6431] can provide very good protection against port guessing
   attacks, but it is very difficult to derive the port set information,
   e.g., the starting point, from a given port number.  This algorithm
   can only be used in binding scenarios; the BR must operate in per-
   subscriber state mode.

   Note: it may be possible to find a cryptographic algorithm which can
   be reversed, e.g. define a reversible one-to-one mapping algorithm.
   But that is out the scope of this memo.  If strong security is
   required, it may be worth giving this topic further study.

3.2.  Fully Stateless: the Generalized Modulus Algorithm (GMA)

   Currently there are three drafts supporting the GMA style algorithm:
   MAP-E [I-D.softwire-map], 4rd-U [I-D.softwire-4rd], and MAP-T
   [I-D.softwire-map-t], but they are not exactly all the same.

3.2.1.  MAP-E

   In MAP [I-D.softwire-map], a port set can be defined by the following
   parameters:

      R: sharing ratio;

      P: PSID;

      M: maximum number of contiguous ports.

   To derive the set of port numbers in the port set corresponding to a
   given PSID value, the following equation can be used:

      Port = (R * M) * i + M * PSID + j

   where i and j are indices which vary within limits to provide the
   different port numbers belonging to the port set.  The range of i
   depends on the value (R * M) and the range of j is from 0 to (M - 1).

   If (R * M) is less than or equal to 2^15, ports (e.g, the well- known
   ports 0-1023) can be excluded from the lower end by putting a lower
   limit dependent on the value (R * M) on index i.  In this case, each
   port set defined by the algorithm consists of a series of ranges of M
   consecutive port numbers at intervals of (R * M).

   On the other hand, if (R * M) is greater than 2^15, the first term
   drops out of the above equation and a lower limit dependent on the
   value of M has to be imposed on the value of PSID to exclude the
   well- known ports.  In this case, each PSID is associated with a
   single range of M consecutive port numbers.

   The GMA is easily reversible.  For a given port number, the
   corresponding PSID is given by:

      PSID = floor( (Port modulo (R * M)) / M))

   If R and M are powers of 2, this becomes a mask operation.  The mask
   consists of 'a' high-order zeroes, followed by 'k' ones, followed by
   'm' low-order zeroes, where:

Internet-Draft         Port Set Algorithm Analysis              May 2013


      2^a = 65536/(R * M);

      2^m = M;

      k = 16 - a - m.

   See Figure 5.

   MAP-E defaults to a value of 'a' equal to 6.  Thus by constraining
   the index i to be >= 1, exactly the well-known port range is

   For a complete explanation of the GMA, see Appendix B of
   [I-D.softwire-map].

   MAP-E embeds the PSID in the End User IPv6 Address provisioned on the
   customer edge device.  See Figure 6.  The PSID's location within the
   address is determined from the Basic Mapping Rule applicable to the
   subscriber.  A mask to extract the PSID from that address is
   described as follows:

   o  High-order zeroes in the amount of (n + 32 - r) bits, where n is
      the length of the IPv6 prefix in the Basic Mapping Rule and r is
      the length of the IPv4 prefix in that rule.

   o  Ones in the amount of (r + o - 32) bits, where o is the number of
      EA bits given by the rule.

   o  Zeroes for the remaining low-order portion of the address.

   This operation is valid only if (r + o) is greater than 32.  If not,
   the IPv4 address or prefix assigned to the subscriber is unshared and
   the customer edge device can use every port.

3.2.2.  4rd-U

   Everything that was described in the previous section for MAP-E also
   applies to 4rd-U [I-D.softwire-4rd], with two differences.  First,
   the mapping rule applicable to a particular customer site includes an
   indication of whether the customer edge equipment is permitted to use
   the well-known ports or whether they must be excluded.

   If the well-known ports are to be excluded, the default value of 'a'
   (recall Figure 5) is 4 rather than 6.  That means that the port set
   consists of 15 rather than 63 ranges, spaced 4096 values apart.  It
   also means that ports 0-4095 rather than ports 0-1023 are excluded.
   At an earlier point in time MAP-E had the same default, for which the
   4rd-U document provides arguments.  However, it was decided that the
   waste of ports entailed (which implies a 6% reduction in the number
   of subscribers sharing the same IPv4 address) was a sufficient reason
   to change.  However, see Section 4 for new evidence on this point.

   If the well-known ports can be used, the default value of 'a' is
   zero.  That is, the PSID is positioned at the beginning of the port
   number.  As mentioned in the previous section, this implies that
   subscribers assigned this mapping rule are assigned a single range of
   consecutive ports.  The subscribers assigned the lowest PSID values
   receive port sets consisting partly or completely of well-known port
   number values.

3.2.3.  MAP-T

   MAP-T [I-D.softwire-map-t] uses the same algorithm to assign port
   sets to customer sites, this time with just one difference.  The
   default value of the offset 'a' is always 4.  The consequences in
   terms of wasted ports were spelled out in the previous section.

3.2.4.  Evaluation

   This section provides an evaluation of the GMA against our comparison
   criteria.

   | number         |                                                  |
   | Port exclusion | Easy, but using a value of the offset 'a'        |
   |                | between 1 and 5 wastes ports and hence reduces   |
   |                | the maximum practical sharing ratio.             |
   | Port set type  | Continuous for 'a' = 0, non-continuous otherwise |
   | Stateless      | No subscriber-specific data required.            |
   | NAT compliance | Port sets are guaranteed to be non-overlapping.  |
   | Sharing ratio  | Equal to 65536/(M * 2^a), where M is the range   |
   |                | size for all subscribers sharing the same        |
   |                | address.  See note.                              |
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

              Table 3: Evaluation of Cryptographic Algorithm

   Note: a practical value of the total number of ports in the port set
   is in the order of 400.  Suppose one wants to guarantee each
   subscriber at least this number of ports.  Recall that the number of
   equal ranges into which the port allocation is divided is equal to 1
   for a = 0, 15 for a = 4, and 63 for a = 6.  Because of the assumption
   of equal range sizes, the number of ports M in each range has to be
   rounded up in the general case to give a total number of ports at
   least equal to 400.  Table 4 shows the consequent impact on sharing
   ratio.  The rounding effect very much dominates the results.  If the
   target were 305 ports instead, the sharing ratio would be the same
   for all three values of a, since 305 is a multiple of 15 and 63.

     Table 4: Port Allocations and Range Size For Different Values Of
                                 Offset a

   In Table 4, the value M is rounded up from the ratio 400/N, where N
   is the number of separate ranges in the port set.  The total number
   of ports in the port set is this result multiplied by the number of
   ranges.  The sharing ratio is then the stated 65536/(M * 2^a),
   rounded down to ensure every subscriber sharing the address gets the
   same number of ports.  For a = 0, this ratio would be reduced by 3 to
   exclude the three ranges containing well-known ports.


4.  Conclusion

   The Generalized Modulus Algorithm (GMA) clearly comes the closest to
   satisfying all of our criteria.  As the example calculation in
   Table 4 shows, the sharing ratio is sensitive to the rounding
   necessary to guarantee at least a certain total number of ports to
   each subscriber.  In this regard, sensitivity will be higher for
   larger values of the offset parameter 'a', leading to the surprising
   result that for some ranges of values of the target total number of
   ports, the sharing ratio will be less for a = 6 than for a = 4 even
   though the latter wastefully excludes an extra 3072 ports.

   The sensitivity of this result to the target total number of ports
   per subscriber is shown if one assumes that that number is 441 ports.
   Then the sharing ratio for a = 6 remains at 146, but that for a = 4
   drops to 136.

   The mask/value algorithm is really a generalization of the GMA.  One
   has the GMA if the one-bits of the mask are constrained to be
   consecutive.  The difference between the binding and fully stateless
   approaches lies not in the algorithm itself, but in how the algorithm
   parameters are conveyed to the border router.  Binding uses per-
   subscriber rules.  The fully stateless approaches reviewed in this
   document use a combination of shared mapping rules and information
   embedded in specially-constructed addresses.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   The major security consideration related to the subject matter of
   this document is the vulnerability of port allocation to a port
   guessing attack.  See [RFC6056] for details.  The most important
   factor in countering such an attack is to allocate ports randomly
   from the assigned port set as they are required by different
   applications.  However, allocating port sets as non-continuous or
   random entities requires the attacker to go to some extra effort in
   order to determine the complete port set allocated to a subscriber.
   Thus resistance to port guessing attacks is improved to a certain
   degree by allocating non-continuous port sets.  For the GMA, this
   means that non-zero values of the offset value 'a' are to be
   preferred.
