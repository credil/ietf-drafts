1.  Introduction

   The Source Address Validation Improvement protocol was developed to
   complement ingress filtering with finer-grained, standardized IP
   source address validation(refer to [I-D.ietf-savi-framework]).A SAVI
   protocol instance is located on the path of hosts' packets, enforcing
   the hosts' use of legitimate IP source addresses.

   SAVI protocol determines whether the IP address obtaining process is
   legitimate according to IP address assignment method.  For links with
   Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND),
   the process is defined in separate documents of SAVI Working Group
   (refer to [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp], [I-D.ietf-savi-fcfs],
   [I-D.ietf-savi-send].)

   This document defines a MIB module that can be used to manage the
   SAVI protocol instance.  It covers both configuration and status
   monitoring aspects of SAVI implementations.

   This document uses terminology from the SAVI Protocol specification.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The SAVI Protocol MIB module (SAVI-MIB) is conformant to SAVI
   protocol, and is designed to:

   o  Support centralized management and monitoring of SAVI protocol
      instance by standard SNMP protocol.

   o  Support configuration and querying of SAVI protocol parameters.

   o  Support configuration and querying of binding entries.  Operators
      may insert and delete static binding entries.

   o  Support querying of filtering entries.

   Based on SAVI protocol, attributes and objects of a SAVI protocol
   instance can be classified into four categories:

   o  System attributes.  These attributes are corresponding to a SAVI
      protocol instance, such as IP Address Assignment Methods and some
      constants.

   o  Anchor attributes.  These attributes are corresponding to a SAVI
      anchor.  Anchor is defined in [I-D.ietf-savi-framework].

   o  Binding Status Table.  This table contains the state of binding
      between source address and binding anchor (refer to
      [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp]).

   o  Filtering Table.  This table contains the bindings between binding
      anchor and address, which is used to filter packets (refer to
      [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp]).

   A table is designed for each category of objects.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the SAVI-MIB module.  The MIB
   objects are derived from the SAVI protocol specification.

   This MIB is composed of a series of tables meant to form the base for
   managing SAVI entities.  The following subsections describe all
   tables in the SAVI MIB module.

5.1.  The SAVI System Table

   The SAVI System Table (saviObjectsSystemTable) contains the objects
   which are corresponding to SAVI system-wide parameters.  It supports
   the configuration and collection of SAVI system-wide parameters.

   There is an entry for each IP stack, IPv4 and IPv6.  The table is
   indexed by:

   o  saviObjectsSystemIPVersion - The IP Version.  A textual convention
      InetVersion defined in RFC4001 is used to represent the different
      version of IP protocol.

   It contains the following objects:

   o  saviObjectsSystemMode - Which IP address assignment method the
      link is running in (refer to [I-D.ietf-savi-framework]).

   o  saviObjectsSystemMaxDhcpResponseTime - A constant defined in SAVI
      protocol (refer to [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp]).

   o  saviObjectsSystemMaxRecoveryInterval - A constant defined in SAVI
      protocol (refer to [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp]).

   o  saviObjectsSystemMaxLeaseQueryDelay - A constant defined in SAVI
      protocol (refer to [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp]).

   o  saviObjectsSystemOffLinkDelay - A constant defined in SAVI
      protocol (refer to [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp]).

   The MAX-ACCESS of thses objects is READ-WRITE.  Network Operators may
   do configuration by setting these objects.

5.2.  The SAVI Port Table

   The SAVI Port Table (saviObjectsPortTable) contains the objects which
   are corresponding to SAVI running parameters of each anchor.  It
   supports the configuration and collection of SAVI parameters of each
   anchor.

   There is an entry for each IP stack, IPv4 and IPv6.  The table is
   indexed by:

   o  saviObjectsPortIPVersion - The IP Version.

   o  saviObjectsPortIfIndex - The index value that uniquely identifies
      the interface to which this entry is applicable.

   It contains the following objects:

   o  saviObjectsPortValidationStatus - The validation status of the
      port. enable(1): check source address. disable(2): don't check
      source address.

   o  saviObjectsPortDhcpTrustStatus - The DHCP trust status of the
      port.

   configure by setting these objects.

5.3.  The SAVI Binding Table

   The SAVI Binding Table (saviObjectsBindingTable) contains the objects
   which are corresponding to Binding State Table (BST) defined in SAVI
   protocol.  It contains the binding parameters and state of each
   binding entry.  It supports the collection of binding entries.  And
   an entry can be inserted or deleted if it is a static binding entry.

   The table is indexed by:

   o  saviObjectsBindingIpAddressType - IP address type.  A textual
      convention InetAddressType defined in RFC4001 is used to represent
      the different kind of IP address.

   o  saviObjectsBindingType - which IP address assignment method is
      used to create the binding entry - static(1), slaac(2), dhcp(3).

   o  saviObjectsBindingIfIndex - The index value that uniquely
      identifies the interface to which this entry is applicable.

   o  saviObjectsBindingIpAddress - The binding source IP address.  A
      textual convention InetAddress defined in RFC4001 is used to
      define this object.

   The SAVI Binding Table contains the following objects:

   o  saviObjectsBindingMacAddr - The binding source mac address.

   o  saviObjectsBindingState - The state of the binding entry.

   o  saviObjectsBindingLifetime - The remaining lifetime of the entry.

   o  saviObjectsBindingRowStatus - The status of this row, by which new
      entries may be created, or old entries be deleted from this table.
      As defined in RFC2579, the RowStatus textual convention is used to
      manage the creation and deletion of conceptual rows.  For SAVI
      Binding Table, an entry can be created or deleted only when
      saviObjectsBindingType=static.

   The MAX-ACCESS of thses objects is READ-CREATE.  Network Operators

   The MODULE-COMPLIANCE,OBJECT-GROUP textual convention is imported
   from SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580].  The MODULE-IDENTITY, OBJECT-IDENTITY,
   OBJECT-TYPE, Unsigned32 textual convention is imported from SNMPv2-
   SMI [RFC2578].

   The MacAddress,TimeInterval,RowStatus textual convention is imported
   from SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579].

   The InetVersion,InetAddressType,InetAddress textual convention is
   imported from INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].

Internet-Draft                  SAVI-MIB                   December 2011


7.1.  Relationship to the INET-ADDRESS-MIB

   To support extensibility, IETF defined new textual conventions to
   represent different IP protocol and different IP address in a unified
   formation in RFC4001.  To support different IP version, a textual
   convention InetVersion is defined to represent the different version
   of IP protocol.  To support different IP address, a generic Internet
   address is defined.  It consists of two objects: The first one has
   the syntax InetAddressType, and the second object have the syntax
   InetAddress.  The value of the first object determines how the value
   of the second is encoded.

   Since SAVI running mode and parameter is independent of IPv4 and
   IPv6, so different OID instances should be defined for each protocol.
   In SAVI-MIB definition, when IP address is used as a part of binding
   table, it is defined using textual conventions described in INET-
   ADDRESS-MIB.

7.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This document contains the interface-specific
   extensions for managing SAVI anchors that are modeled as interfaces.

   The IF-MIB module is required to be supported on the SAVI device.
   The interface MUST be modeled as an ifEntry, and ifEntry objects such
   as ifIndex are to be used as per [RFC2863].

   An ifIndex [RFC2863] is used as a common index for interfaces in the
   SAVI-MIB modules.

7.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The SAVI MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579],SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863] and INET-
   ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] .

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network



An, et al.                Expires June 22, 2012                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                  SAVI-MIB                   December 2011


   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  saviObjectsSystemTable - Unauthorized changes to the writable
      objects under saviObjectsSystemTable MAY disrupt allocation of
      resources in the network.  For example, a device's SAVI system
      mode be changed by set operation to SAVI-DISABLE will give chance
      to IP source address spoofing.

   o  saviObjectsPortTable - Unauthorized changes to the writable
      objects under saviObjectsPortTable MAY disrupt allocation of
      resources in the network.  For example, an anchor's
      ValidationStatus be changed by set operation to DISABLE will give
      chance to IP source address spoofing.

   o  saviObjectsBindingTable - Unauthorized changes to the writable
      objects under this table MAY disrupt allocation of resources in
      the network.  For example, a static binding entry is inserted to
      the BST will give chance to IP source address spoofing.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  saviObjectsBindingTable, saviObjectsFilteringTable - The IP
      address and binding anchor information will be helpful to some
      attacks.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator

   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
