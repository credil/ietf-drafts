          PCP Server Discovery based on well-known IP Address
                 draft-kiesel-pcp-ip-based-srv-disc-00

Abstract

   The Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to control how
   incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as Network
   Address Translator IPv6/IPv4 (NAT64), Network Address Translator
   IPv4/IPv4 (NAT44), IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices, and a mechanism to
   reduce application keep alive traffic.

   This document establishes a well-known IP address for the PCP Server
   and documents how PCP clients embedded in endpoints can use it during
   the discovery and regular operation phases.

Internet-Draft        IP-based PCP Server Discovery        February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Port Control Protocol (PCP) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] provides a
   mechanism to control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream
   devices such as Network Address Translator IPv6/IPv4 (NAT64), Network
   Address Translator IPv4/IPv4 (NAT44), IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices,
   and a mechanism to reduce application keep alive traffic.

   But before a PCP client can perform any of these tasks it needs to
   discover one or more PCP servers.  Several algorithms have been
   specified that produce a suitable PCP Server address given PCP client
   (i.e., the address may vary for different clients or different points
   of network attachment, etc.).  These approaches are based on user
   input, DHCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] or default router, which is the one
   detailed in the PCP base document [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

   But unfortunately in many deployments, the first-hop router does not
   run a PCP server, or DHCP cannot be used.  These and other problems
   are described in detail in the Appendix.Appendix A.

   This document follows a different approach: it establishes a well-
   known address for the PCP Server (TBD: this approach could easily be
   generalized in order to discover other services as well.  But this is
   for further study).  PCP clients are expected to send requests to
   this address during the PCP Server discovery process.  A PCP Server
   configured with the anycast address could optionally redirect or
   return a list of unicast PCP Servers to the client.

2.  PCP Server Discovery based on well-known IP Address

2.1.  Well-Known PCP Server IP Address (WkPsdIPa)

   IANA is requested to register a single IPv4 address 192.0.0.X (TBD)
   and a single IPv6 address 2001::XXXX (TBD) within the respective
   Special Purpose Address Registries as the well-known IP anycast
   addresses for PCP Servers.  These addresses are called WkPsdIPa
   (well-known PCP server discovery IP address(es)) in this document.

2.2.  PCP Discovery Client behavior

   PCP Clients that need to discover PCP servers should first send a PCP
   request to its default router.  This is important because in the case
   of cascaded PCP Servers, all of them need to be discovered in order
   of hop distance from the client.  The PCP client then SHOULD send a
   PCP request to the WkPsdIPa.  PCP Clients must be prepared to receive
   an error and try other discovery methods.

2.3.  PCP Discovery Server behavior

   PCP Server can be configured to listen on the WkPsdIPa for incoming
   PCP requests.

   PCP responses are sent from that same IANA-assigned address (see Page
   5 of [RFC1546]).

3.  Deployment Considerations

   Network operators should install one or more PCP Servers as specified
   above.  Depending on the network deployment scenario they may use IP
   routing tables, or other suitable mechanisms to direct PCP requests
   to one of these servers.

   [TBD: explain in more detail] This works fine even with cascaded
   access routers with NATs.  After each router hop the operator may
   decide whether to handle the discovery requests, e.g., using a static
   routing table entry, or whether let them flow "automatically" towards
   the Internet backbones using the default routing table entry.

3.1.  Multiple PCP Servers, Symmetric Routing

   In the case of symmetric routing all inbound and outbound packets
   from a PCP client traverse the same PCP Server or controlled device.
   Multiple PCP Servers sharing an anycast address in a symmetric
   routing scenario are used for two purposes: ease of network
   configuration and redundancy.  In the case of redundancy, If there is
   a network or routing change a PCP client might start interacting with
   a different PCP Server sharing the same anycast address.  From a PCP
   Client point of view this would be the same as a PCP Server reboot
   and a PCP Client could find out about it by examining the Epoch field
   during the next PCP request or ANNOUNCE message.

3.2.  Multiple PCP Servers, Assymetric Routing

   In the case of asymmetric routing inbound packets from a PCP client
   traverse a different PCP Server or controlled device than outbound
   packets.  If these PCP Servers are firewalls, the PCP client would
   need to create mappings on both of them in order to properly
   communicate with other hosts.  But if these PCP Servers share an
   anycast address the PCP Client will create mappings in only on, when
   in fact should create mapping on both of them.

   Therefore in order to support this scenario we propose a new option
   for the ANNOUNCE opcode.  This will allow a PCP Client to request
   from a PCP Server a list of unicast IP addresses associated with
   other PCP Servers.  The client can then proceed to create mappings on
   these PCP Servers using their unicast addresses.

      address is intended to be routable only in scoped, local, or
      private contexts, or whether the address prefix is intended to be
      routed globally.

Appendix A.  Problems with Other Discovery methods

   Several algorithms have been specified that allows PCP Client to
   discover the PCP Servers on a network .  However, each of this
   approaches has technical or operational issues that will hinder the
   fast deployment of PCP.

A.1.  DHCP PCP Options

   There are two problems with DHCP Options: DHCP Server on Home
   Gateways (HGW) and Operating Systems DHCP clients

   Currently what the HGW does with the options it receives from the ISP
   is not standardized in any general way.  As a matter of practice, the
   HGW is most likely to use its own customer-LAN-facing IP address for
   the DNS server address.  As for other options, it's free to offer the
   same values to the client, offer no value at all, or offer its own IP
   address if that makes sense, as it does (sort of) for DNS.

   In scenarios where PCP Server resides on ISP network and is intended
   to work with arbitrary home gateways that don't know they are being
   used in a PCP context, that won't work, because there's no reason to
   think that the HGW will even request the option from the DHCP server,
   much less offer the value it gets from the server on the customer-
   facing LAN.  There is work on the DHC WG to overcome some of these
   limitations [I-D.ietf-dhc-container-opt] but in terms of deployment
   it also needs HGW to be upgraded.

   The problems with Operating Systems is that even if DHCP PCP Option
   were made available to customer-facing LAN, host stack DHCP
   enhancements are required to process or request new DHCP PCP option.
   One exception is Windows [DhcpRequestParams]

   Finally, in the case of IPv6 there are networks where there is DHCPv6
   infrastructure at all or some hosts do not have a DHCPv6 client.

A.2.  Default Router

   If PCP server does not reside in first hop router, whether because
   subscriber has a existing home router or in the case of Wireless
   Networks (3G, LTE) [I-D.chen-pcp-mobile-deployment], trying to send a
   request to default router will not work.

A.3.  User Input

   A regular subscriber can not be expected to input IP address of PCP
   Server or network domain name.  Moreover, user can be at a Wi-Fi
   hotspot, Hotel or related.  Therefore relying on user input is not

Internet-Draft        IP-based PCP Server Discovery        February 2013


   reliable.

A.4.  Domain Name System Based

   There are three separate category of problems with NAPTR [RFC3958]

   1.  End Points: It relies on PCP client determining the domain name
       and supporting certain DNS queries

   2.  DNS Servers: DNS server need to be provisioned with the necessary
       records
