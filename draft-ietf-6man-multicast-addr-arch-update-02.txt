1.  Introduction

   This document updates the IPv6 multicast addressing architecture
   [RFC4291] by defining the 17-20 reserved bits as generic flag bits
   (Section 2).  The document provides also some clarifications related
   to the use of these flag bits (Section 3.1).

   This document updates [RFC3956], [RFC3306], and [RFC4291].

2.  Addressing Architecture Update

   Bits 17-20 of a multicast address are defined in [RFC3956] and
   [RFC3306] as reserved bits.  This document defines these bits as
   generic flag bits so that they apply to any multicast address.
   Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the updated structure of the addressing
   architecture.  The first diagram shows the update of the base IPv6
   addressing architecture, and the second shows the update of so-called
   Embedded-RP.

   Further specification documents may define a meaning for these flag
   bits.  Defining the bits 17-20 as flags for all IPv6 multicast
   addresses allows addresses to be treated in a more uniform and
   generic way, and allows for these bits to be defined in the future
   for different purposes, irrespective of the specific type of
   multicast address.

3.  Clarifications

3.1.  Flag Bits

   Some implementations and specification documents do not treat the
   flag bits as separate bits but tend to use their combined value as a
   4-bit integer.  This practice is a hurdle for assigning a meaning to
   the remaining flag bits.  Below are listed some examples for
   illustration purposes:

   o  the reading of [RFC3306] may lead to conclude that ff3x::/32 is
      the only allowed SSM IPv6 prefix block.

   o  [RFC3956] states only ff70::/12 applies to Embedded-RP.
      Particularly, implementations should not treat the fff0::/12 range
      as Embedded-RP.

   To avoid such confusion and to unambiguously associate a meaning with
   the remaining flags, the following requirement is made

      Implementations MUST treat flag bits as separate bits.

4.  RFC Updates

4.1.  RFC 3306

   This document changes Section 4 of [RFC3306] as follows:

   OLD:

         |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    |

      flgs is a set of 4 flags:       |0|0|P|T|
                                      +-+-+-+-+

            o  P = 0 indicates a multicast address that is not assigned
               based on the network prefix.  This indicates a multicast
               address as defined in [ADDRARCH].

            o  P = 1 indicates a multicast address that is assigned based
               on the network prefix.

            o  If P = 1, T MUST be set to 1, otherwise the setting of the T
               bit is defined in Section 2.7 of [ADDRARCH].

      The reserved field MUST be zero.


   NEW:

         |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    |

      flgs is a set of 4 flags:       |X|Y|P|T|
                                      +-+-+-+-+

      X and Y may each be set to 0 or 1.

            o  P = 0 indicates a multicast address that is not assigned
               based on the network prefix.  This indicates a multicast
               address as defined in [ADDRARCH].

            o  P = 1 indicates a multicast address that is assigned based
               on the network prefix.

            o  If P = 1, T MUST be set to 1, otherwise the setting of the T
               bit is defined in Section 2.7 of [ADDRARCH].


   This document changes Section 6 of [RFC3306] as follows:

   OLD:

      These settings create an SSM range of FF3x::/32 (where 'x' is any
      valid scope value).  The source address field in the IPv6 header
      identifies the owner of the multicast address.

   NEW:

      If the flag bits are set to 0011, these settings create an SSM
      range of ff3x::/32 (where 'x' is any valid scope value).  The
      source address field in the IPv6 header identifies the owner of
      the multicast address. ff3x::/32 is not the only allowed SSM
      prefix range.  For example if the most significant flag bit is
      set, then we would get the SSM range ffbx::/32.

4.2.  RFC 3956

   This document changes Section 2 of [RFC3956] as follows:

   OLD:

      As described in [RFC3306], the multicast address format is as
      follows:

         |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    | 8  |       64       |    32    |
         +--------+----+----+--------+----+----------------+----------+
         |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved|plen| network prefix | group ID |
         +--------+----+----+--------+----+----------------+----------+

      Where flgs are "0011".  (The first two bits are as yet undefined,
      sent as zero and ignored on receipt.)

      The multicast address format is as
      follows:

         flgs is a set of four flags:    |X|R|P|T|
                                         +-+-+-+-+

         X may be set to 0 or 1.


   This document changes Section 3 of [RFC3956] as follows:

   OLD:

         |   8    |  4 |  4 |  4 |  4 | 8  |       64       |    32    |

                                         +-+-+-+-+
         flgs is a set of four flags:    |0|R|P|T|
                                         +-+-+-+-+

      When the highest-order bit is 0, R = 1 indicates a multicast address
      that embeds the address on the RP.  Then P MUST be set to 1, and
      consequently T MUST be set to 1, as specified in [RFC3306].  In
      effect, this implies the prefix FF70::/12.  In this case, the last 4
      bits of the previously reserved field are interpreted as embedding
      the RP interface ID, as specified in this memo.

      The behavior is unspecified if P or T is not set to 1, as then the
      prefix would not be FF70::/12.  Likewise, the encoding and the
      protocol mode used when the two high-order bits in "flgs" are set to
      11 ("FFF0::/12") is intentionally unspecified until such time that
      the highest-order bit is defined.  Without further IETF
      specification, implementations SHOULD NOT treat the FFF0::/12 range
      as Embedded-RP.

         X may be set to 0 or 1.

      R = 1 indicates a multicast address that embeds the address of the RP.
      P MUST be set to 1, and consequently T MUST be set to 1, according
      to [RFC3306], as this is a special case of
      unicast-prefix based addresses. This implies that for instance prefixes
      ff70::/12 and fff0::/12 are embedded RP prefixes, but all multicast
      addresses with the R-bit set to 1 MUST be treated as Embedded RP
      addresses. The behavior is unspecified if P or T is not set to 1. When the
      R-bit is set, the last 4 bits of the previously reserved field are
      interpreted as embedding the RP interface ID, as specified in this memo.



   This document changes Section 4 of [RFC3956] as follows:

   OLD:

      It MUST be a multicast address with "flgs" set to 0111, that is,
      to be of the prefix FF70::/12,

   NEW:

      It MUST be a multicast address with R-bit set to 1.

      It MUST have P-bit and T-bit both set to 1 when using the
      embedding in this document as it is a prefix-based address.

   This document changes Section 7.1 of [RFC3956] as follows:

   OLD:

      To avoid loops and inconsistencies, for addresses in the range
      FF70::/12, the Embedded-RP mapping MUST be considered the longest
      possible match and higher priority than any other mechanism.

      To avoid loops and inconsistencies, for addresses with R-bit set
