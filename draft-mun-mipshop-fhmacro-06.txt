              Fast Macro Mobility Handovers in HMIPv6
                 draft-mun-mipshop-fhmacro-06.txt

Abstract

   In Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), a mobile node (MN) moving from 
   one MAP domain to another can experience both long handover latency 
   and packet loss due to the distance between the two MAPs. To solve 
   the problems, this document describes two fast handover schemes that 
   support fast macro mobility handover. These fast handover schemes can
   reduce both the handover latency and the pakcet loss. The schemes 
   described in this document adopt the fast handover of FMIPv6 protocol 
   to the edge access routers in MAP domains. The schemes support two 
   fast handover modes for macro mobility handover in HMIPv6.

Internet-Draft       Macro Fast Handover in HMIPv6        September 2011


1. Introduction

   Increasingly, the wireless access services and devices has released 
   and used widely. According to the tendency of the many customers, 
   wireless access devices should support more rapid and stable access 
   services to access Internet. Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is a protocol to 
   provide MN with mobility in IPv6 environment. Although MIPv6 enables 
   the IPv6 MN to be connected to the layer 3 while it changes its point 
   of attachment, MIPv6 raises two critical problems; the long handover 
   latency and packet loss. To make up for the problems, the fast 
   handovers for mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) and the hierarchical mobile IPv6 
   protocol have proposed. 
   
   To reduce the handover latency and the packet loss, FMIPv6 provides 
   the fast handover schemes between the access routers in order to 
   support seamless network access services to the MNs in IPv6 network. 
   The layer 3 handover before performing the layer 2 handover is 
   performed by FMIPv6 protocol prior to move into new link. During the 
   real layer 2 handover, access routers use a tunnel for the MN's 
   packets that are transmitted to the previous link. FMIPv6 has two 
   modes of operation in accordance with the time of layer 2 handover of 
   MN; a predictive mode and a reactive mode. These modes support more 
   robust, fast handover to the MN which moves between access routers.  
   
   HMIPv6 introduces a new entity, called a Mobility Anchor Point. 
   HMIPv6 manages the movement of the MNs by using the MAP. In HMIPv6 
   network, a MN has to generate two care-of addresses; a regional 
   care-of address (RCoA) and an on-link care-of address (LCoA). A RCoA 
   is created based on the prefix of the MAP domain and a LCoA is 
   created based on the prefix of the attached access router. When a MN
   moves into a new access router belonging to a new MAP domain, the 
   movement is called a micro mobility handover. To improve performance 
   of the micro mobility handover, there is a method applied the fast 
   handover technique of FMIPv6 to the access routers. If the MN moves 
   from one access router to another belonging to different MAP domain, 
   the movement is a macro mobility handover. 
   
   When the MN performs a macro mobility handover, this means that it 
   moves into a new MAP domain. The MN must create two care-of 
   addresses, RCoA and LCoA. Obviously, a new RCoA generation is the 
   same that a MN changes CoA in MIPv6. Thus, change of RCoA causes the 
   same problems as MIPv6's. Although the macro mobility handover causes 
   the same long handover latency and packet loss problems, there is no 
   efficient method to sovle the problems. Therefore, a new method is 
   needed to execute the macro mobility handover rapidly and to reduce 
   both the long handover latency and the packet loss.

   This document describes the fast macro mobility handovers in HMIPv6 
   to perform efficiently the handover and reduce both the handover 
   latency and the packet loss. The fast macro mobility handovers have 
   two modes according to the time of layer 2 handover of the mobile 
   node, as the two modes of FMIPv6.

3. Fast Macro Mobility Handovers in HMIPv6

3.1. Overview

   In HMIPv6, a macro mobility handover is that a MN moves from the pAR 
   in the pMAR domain to the nAR in the nMAP domain. The fast macro 
   mobility handover has two modes of operation. One is a predictive 
   mode of the macro mobility handover. Another mode is a reactive mode.
   It occurs when the MN just perform the real layer 2 handover before 
   exchanging messages for the fast handover prior to move into a new 
   link. In the predictive mode, the handover occurs immediately after 
   the MN receives the FBAck message from the pAR in the pMAP domain. 
   In the reactive mode, the MN does not receive the FBAck message 
   before the layer 2 handover. It is possbile in the case that the MN
   moves rapidly prior to complete the preparation of the fast handover.
   For this situation, the packets transmitted to the MN's old address 
   are needed to transfer to the MN's new address. Thus, the reactive 
   mode also uses a tunnel between the MN's pAR and the MN's nAR in 
   order to receive the packets without any loss. For the fast macro 
   mobility handover, the reference scenario is shown as Figure.1.

3.2. Operation of the predictive mode of macro mobility handover 

   A MN receives PrRtAdv messages periodically from the currently 
   attached access router and other access routers close to it. The MN 
   also can request the PrRtAdv messages by sending a RtSolPr message in 
   order to obtain the network information immediately. 
   
   If the received PrRtAdv message includes information about the new 
   MAP domain, the MN would anticipate the occurence of the macro 
   mobility handover. Using the information included in the received 
   PrRtAdv message, the MN creates both an nLCoA based on the prefix of 
   the nAR and an nRCoA based on the prefix of the nMAP. The MN then 
   sends a FBU message to the pAR. 
   
   The pAR received FBU message from the MN sends a HI message to the 
   nAR that the MN expects to move into. The nAR must perform a 
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process for the nLCoA requested by
   the MN as defined in [1]. Simutaneously, the nAR also sends a HI 
   message to the nMAP in order to request the DAD test for the nRCoA 
   asked by the MN. In reply to the HI message, the nAR sends a HAck 
   message to the pAR at the same time. If the nRCoA is duplicated in 
   the nMAP domain, the nMAP informs the result to the nAR and nAR sends 
   a FNA message with an NAACK option to the MN. The NAACK option 
   informs that the nRCoA is not available in the nMAP domain and it 
   must create a new RCoA. Thus, the nAR does not need to wait for the 
   HAck message from the nMAP. Through the exchange of the HI and HAck 
   messages between the nAR and the pAR, a tunnel is established between 
   the nAR and the pAR for forwarding packets destined to the MN during 
   the layer 2 handover.    
   
   The pAR received the HAck message from the nAR sends FBAck message to
   both the nAR and the MN simutaneously. As soon as the nAR and the MN 
   receive the FBAck messages, the layer 2 handover occurs. During the 
   handover, the packets destined to the MN are forwarded from the pAR 
   to the nAR, and stored in the nAR for a while. Therefore, the packet 
   loss can be reduced in macro mobility handover. After the handover, 
   the MN should send a FNA message to the nAR in order to receive the 
   packets forwarded during the handover. After the FNA message, the MN 
   can use the nLCoA. Thus, the handover latency can be reduced. 
   Finally, the MN should perform the local registration by using LBU 
   and LBA messages with the nMAP. After completion of the local 
   registration, the MN must sending BU message to the its HA in order 
   to bind the its home address with the nRCoA as the CoA. Figure 2 
   represent the procedure of the predictive macro mobility mode.

           Figure 2 : Predictive Mode of Macro Mobility Handover
    
 
3.3. Operation of the Reactive Macro Mobility Mode

   The reactive mode of macro mobility handover is analogous to the 
   reactive mode of FMIPv6. A MN performs the reactive mode of operation 
   in order to solve the various erroneous situations. Similarly, the 
   fast macro mobility handover is needed to solve the various erroneous 
   cases. The reactive mode of macro mobility handover would be the 
   solution to improve the fast handover operation. 
   
   In the reactive mode of macro mobility handover, if the MN carries 
   out the layer 2 handover before completing the fast binding 
   operation, which the MN does not send or receive the FBU or FBAck 
   messages, the MN would convert the fast handover operation into the 
   reactive mode of macro mobility handover. 
   
   The MN receives PrRtAdv messages periodically or requests the 
   messages by sending RtSolPr messages, as mentioned section 3.2. Due 
   to the MN's rapid movement from the previous link to the new one or 
   the erroneous situation, the MN could not send or receive the FBU 
   message or FBAck message prior to the layer 2 handover. In this case, 
   the macro mobility handover is the reactive mode. After the layer 2

   handover, the MN should firstly generate a special FNA message. This 
   FNA message is defined in [2]. The MN sends the FNA message with the 
   FBU message to the nAR. The nAR received the FNA message included the 
   FBU message should perform the DAD operation for the addresses of the 
   MN. At the same time, the nAR sends FBU message to the pAR of the MN. 
   The pAR sends a FBAck message in reply to the FBU message and then 
   forwards the packets of the MN to the nAR. Therefore, the MN can 
   receive the packets transferred to the pAR from the nAR without 
   packet loss. 
   
   Finally, the MN also should perform both the local binding operation 
   by using LBU and LBA messages and the home bidning operation by using 
   BU and BA messages with its HA. The procedure of the reactive mode of
   macro mobility handover is shown as Figure 3.

4. Security Considerations

   This document describes the fast macro mobility handovers in HMIPv6 
   environment. The two handover modes represented in this document 
   assumes that the edge access routers within a MAP domain have 
   association with adjacent edge access routers in other MAP domains. 
   Due to this assumption, the association between each MAP domain 
   considers possible security theats caused by communicating between 
   two edge routers belongs to different MAP domains. Also, this fast 
   handover methods have the security consideration of [1], [2] and [3].
