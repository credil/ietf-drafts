Abstract 

   MPLS as a mature technology is increasingly deployed in large-scale 
   networks which consists of multiple domains (e.g., IGP areas/levels 
   and even Autonomous Systems). To scale such multi-domain MPLS 
   deployment, the concept of hierarchical LSPs is usually resorted. 
   This document describes an enhancement to such hierarchical multi-
   domain MPLS deployment architecture that could further improve the 
   scalability of multi-domain MPLS deployment.

Internet-Draft   Multi-domain MPLS Deployment Enhancement  October 2013 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   MPLS as a mature technology is increasingly deployed in large-scale 
   networks which consists of multiple IGP areas/levels and even 
   multiple Autonomous Systems (AS's) (e.g., Inter-AS L3VPN option C 
   described in [RFC4364]). For simplicity, in the rest of this document 
   the term "domain" would be used to refer area/level/AS. To scale such 
   multi-domain MPLS deployment, the concept of hierarchical LSPs is 
   usually resorted. The basic idea behind this concept is the innermost 
   transport LSP which is across domain boundaries is actually 
   transported over multiple outer transport LSPs which are confined 
   within each domain (a.k.a., originated and terminated within the same 
   domain). Such a hierarchical routing and forwarding concept allows 
   exchange of loopback addresses and MPLS label bindings for innermost 
   transport LSPs across these domains while preventing the above 
   information from being flooded into domains or parts of the network 
   that do not need them. In most cases, the innermost transport LSPs 
   are established primarily using labeled BGP [RFC3107]. In some 
   special cases (e.g., seamless MPLS [Seamless-MPLS]), the innermost 
   transport LSP could also be a stitched LSP of BGP-signaled LSPs and 
   LDP-signaled LSPs.   

   Such a hierarchical routing and forwarding concept has greatly 
   improved the scalability of the multi-domain MPLS deployment. However, 
   in the case where the number of PE routers is enormous, a large 
   amount of non-aggregatable labeled BGP routes for those PE routers 
   would have to be advertised across domain boundaries. As stated in 
   the seamless MPLS draft [Seamless-MPLS], "...this architecture results 
   in carrying all loopbacks of all nodes except pure P nodes (AN, AGN, 
   ABR and core PE) in labeled BGP, e.g., there will be in the order of 
   100,000 routes in labeled BGP when approaching the stated scalability 
   goal..." Without special implementation and configuration, it would 
   result in tremendous and unnecessary consumption of the BGP RIB and 
   even MPLS forwarding table resources on domain boundary nodes (e.g., 
   ABRs). Therefore, there is still room for improvement in scalability.  

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC3031] and [RFC3107].  

3. Deployment Enhancement 

   In the hierarchical LSP case as mentioned in Section 1, the innermost 
   transport LSP only represents a logical connectivity to the final 
   tunnel endpoint (e.g., egress PE routers). As such, it's no problem 
   to replace such innermost transport LSP with an IP tunnel while

   keeping the remaining outer MPLS LSPs unchanged. In this way, there 
   is no need for advertising no-aggregatable labeled BGP host routes 
   across domain boundaries anymore. Instead, it only requires 
   advertising aggregated non-labeled BGP routes across domain 
   boundaries. 

   To clearly understand the concept of the multi-domain MPLS deployment 
   enhancement as suggested above, a multi-area MPLS deployment example 
   with enhancement is illustrated as follows: 

             /----\              /-------\              /----\ 
          ///      \\\\       ///         \\\       ////      \\\\ 
   +----+              +-----+               +-----+              +----+ 
   |PE-1|  OSPF Area 1 |ABR-1|  OSPF Area 0  |ABR-2|  OSPF Area 2 |PE-2| 
   +----+              +-----+               +-----+              +----+ 
         \\\\      ////       \\\         ///       \\\\      //// 
             \----/              \-------/              \----/ 

      |<--------------------------IP Tunnel------------------------>| 

      |<------LSP-------->|<--------LSP-------->|<--------LSP------>| 

   In the above example, iBGP sessions are established between PEs (i.e., 
   PE-1 and PE-2) and ABRs (e.g., ABR-1 and ABR-2). Assume loopback 
   addresses of all PEs within area 1 are within 10.1.0.0/16 while 
   loopback addresses of all PEs within area 2 are within 10.2.0.0/16. 
   ABR1 would advertise a route for 10.1.0.0/16 to ABR-2 which in turn 
   advertises that route upon receiving to PE-2. Similarly, ABR-2 would 
   advertise a route for 10.2.0.0/16 to ABR-1 which in turn advertises 
   that route upon receiving to PE-1. In addition, intra-domain LSPs 
   have been established between PEs and ABRs. 

   Assume PE-1 needs to send a packet P1 to PE-2, PE-1 would encapsulate 
   such packet into an IP tunnel with tunnel source of PE-1's loopback 
   address and tunnel destination of PE-2's loopback address. For 
   example, if the packet is a MPLS IP VPN packet, the packet would be 
   encapsulated using any IP-based encapsulation method for MPLS (e.g., 
   MPLS-in-IP). PE-1 then performs IP forwarding lookup for the 
   encapsulated packet P2. Since the BGP next-hop of the best route 
   (i.e., 10.2.0.0/16) for the packet P2's destination (i.e., PE-2's 
   loopback address) is ABR-1 and PE-1 has a LSP towards ABR-1, PE-1 
   therefore would transport that encapsulated packet P2 over that LSP. 
   Upon receipt of that encapsulated packet P2 via that LSP, ABR-1 would 
   in turn perform IP forwarding lookup for the encapsulated packet P2. 
   Since the BGP next-hop of the best route for that packet is ABR-2 and 
   ABR1 has a LSP towards ABR-2, ABR-1 would transport that encapsulated 
   packet P2 via the LSP towards ABR-2. When that encapsulated packet P2

   arrives at ABR-2, ABR-2 would also perform IP forwarding lookup and 
   then forward that packet P2 via a LSP towards PE-2. PE-2 decapsulates 
   the received packet P2 and then process the resulting decapsualted 
   packet P1 accordingly. 

4. Conclusions 

   By simply replacing the innermost transport LSP with an IP tunnel, 
   the need for advertising non-aggregatable BGP labeled host routes 
   across domains is eliminated. Instead, it only requires advertising 
   aggregated non-labeled BGP routes across domains. As a result, the 
   requirement for BGP RIB and MPLS forwarding table resources are 
   largely reduced. Furthermore, in the multi-area/level MPLS deployment 
   case where MPLS-TE shortcut or Forwarding Adjacency (FA) feature is 
   enabled between ABRs, the need for running BGP between ABRs can be 
   eliminated further. Instead, IGP route summary across area boundaries 
   is good enough. 

5. Security Considerations 

   TBD. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   No action is required for IANA.
