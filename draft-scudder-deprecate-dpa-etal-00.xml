      <t>
    As of this writing the BGP Path Attributes registry maintained
    by IANA contains entries for DPA, ADVERTISER, and RCID_PATH / CLUSTER_ID.
    The first of these is associated with <xref target="draft-ietf-idr-bgp-dpa-05"></xref>,
    an Internet Draft that was abandoned in 1996.
    The latter are associated with <xref target="RFC1863"></xref>, an RFC that 
    was reclassified as Historic in 2005.  Neither of these specifications is
    in use now, nor ever was.
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
    This document requests IANA to mark the BGP Path Attributes registry
    entries for DPA, ADVERTISER, and RCID_PATH / CLUSTER_ID as "Deprecated".
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
    There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this registry
    update.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
