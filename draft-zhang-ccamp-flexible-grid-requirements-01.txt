1. Introduction 

   [G.694.1v1] defines the DWDM frequency grids for WDM applications. A 
   frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies used to denote 
   allowed nominal central frequencies that may be used for defining 
   applications. The channel spacing, i.e. the frequency spacing 
   between two allowed nominal central frequencies could be 12.5 GHz, 
   25 GHz, 50 GHz, 100 GHz and integer multiples of 100 GHz as defined 
   in [G.694.1v1]. The frequency spacing of the channels on a fiber is 
   fixed.  

   The speed of the optical signal becomes higher and higher with the 
   advancement of the optical technology. In the near future, high-
   speed signals (beyond 100 Gbit/s or even 400 Gbit/s) will be 
   deployed in optical networks. These signals may not be accommodated 
   in the channel spacing specified in [G.694.1v1]. On the other hand, 
   ''mixed rate'' scenarios will be commonplace, and bandwidth 
   requirements of the optical signals with different speed will 
   probably be quite different. As a consequence, when the optical 
   signals with different speed are mixed to be transmitted on a fiber, 
   the frequency allocation needs to be more flexible to promote the 
   efficiency.  

   An updated version of [G.694.1v1] will be consented in December 2011 
   in support of flexible grids. The terms ''frequency slot (the 
   frequency range allocated to a channel and unavailable to other 
   channels within a flexible grid)'' and ''slot width'' (the full width 
   of a frequency slot in a flexible grid) are introduced to address 
   flexible grid. A channel is represented as a LSC (Lambda Switching 
   Capable) LSP in the control plane and it means a LSC LSP should 
   occupy a frequency slot on each fiber it traverses. In the case of 
   flexible grid, different LSC LSPs may have different slot widths on 
   a fiber, i.e. the slot width is flexible on a fiber.  

   WSON related documents are being developed currently with the focus 
   of the GMPLS control of fixed grid optical networks. This document 
   describes the new characteristics of flexible grids and analyses the 
   requirements of GMPLS control for the new ''flexible grid'' based 
   optical transmission.  

2. Terminology  

   Flexible Grid: a new WDM frequency grid defined with the aim of 
   allowing flexible optical spectrum management, in which the Slot 
   Width of the frequency ranges allocated to different channels are 
   flexible (variable sized). 

 
 
Zhang                       Expires 2012                      [Page 3] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-requiements-01.txt         October 2011 
    

   Frequency Range: a frequency range is defined by a lowest frequency 
   and a highest frequency. 

   Frequency Slot: The frequency range allocated to a channel and 
   unavailable to other channels within a flexible grid. A frequency 
   slot is defined by its nominal central frequency and its slot width.  

   Slot Width: the full width (in Hz) of a frequency slot in a flexible 
   grid. A slot width can be expressed as a multiple (m) of a basic 
   slot width (e.g. 12.5 GHz) 

   SSON: Spectrum-Switched Optical Network. An optical network in which 
   a data plane connection is switched based on an optical spectrum 
   frequency slot of a variable (flexible) slot width, rather than 
   based on a fixed grid. Note than a wavelength switched optical 
   network (WSON) can be seen as a particular case of SSON in which all 
   slot widths are equal and depend on the used channel spacing. 

   LSC SS-LSP or flexi-LSP (Lambda Switch Capable Spectrum-Switched 
   Label Switched Path): a control plane construct that represents a 
   data plane connection in which the switching involves a frequency 
   slot of a variable (flexible) slot width. The mapped client signal 
   is transported over the frequency slot, using spectrum efficient 
   modulations such as Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division 
   Multiplexing (CO-OFDM) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques. 
   Although still in the scope of LSC, the term flexi-LSP is used, when 
   needed, to differentiate from regular WSON LSP in which switching is 
   based on a nominal wavelength.  

3. Characteristics of Flexible Grid  

   Per [G.FLEXIGRID], a flexible grid is defined for the DWDM system. 
   Compared with the fixed grids (i.e. traditional DWDM), flexible grid 
   has a smaller granularity for the central frequency and the slot 
   width of the LSC LSPs is more flexible on a fiber.  

3.1. Central Frequency  

   According to the definition of flexible DWDM grid in [G.FLEXIGRID], 
   the step granularity for the central frequency of flexible grid is 
   6.25 GHz. The allowed nominal central frequencies are calculated as 
   in the case of flexible grid:  

              Central Frequency = 193.1 THz + n * 0.00625 THz  

   Where 193.1 THz is ITU-T ''anchor frequency'' for transmission over 
   the C band and n is a positive or negative integer including 0.

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-requiements-01.txt         October 2011 
    

3.2. Slot Width  

   A slot width is defined by: 

   12.5 GHz * m, where m is a positive integer. 

   Note that, when flexi-grid is supported on a fiber or DWDM link, the 
   slot width of different flexi-LSPs may be different.  

4. Impact on WSON  

   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs) are constructed from 
   subsystems that include Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) links, 
   tunable transmitters and receivers, Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop 
   Multiplexers (ROADMs), wavelength converters, and electro-optical 
   network elements. WSON framework is described in [RFC6163]. The 
   introduced flexible grid brings some changes on WSON.  

   The concept of WSON is extended to SSON, to highlight that such 
   subsystems are extended with flexible and/or elastic capabilities 
   (i.e. flexi-grid). Note that, when modeling SSONs, a WSON can be 
   seen as a particular case of SSON where all LSC LSP use a fixed (and 
   equal) slot width which depends on the used channel spacing. 

   Transceivers may be able to fully leverage flexible optical channels 
   with advanced modulation formats, and ROADMs may need to be extended 
   to allow flexible spectrum switching, based in, for example, 
   Spectrum Selective Switches (SSS).  

4.1. Fiber Links  

   The nominal (central) frequencies for the flexible grid are defined 
   with a granularity of 6.25 GHz and the allocated frequency slot 
   widths are defined as a multiple of 12.5 GHz. The fiber link for 
   flexible grid can be modeled as shown in figure 1.

   The symbol '+' represents the allowed nominal central frequency. The 
   symbol ''--" represents a 6.25 GHz frequency unit. The number on the 
   top of the line represents the 'n' in the frequency calculation 
   formula. The nominal central frequency is 193.1 THz when n equals 
   zero.  

   Because the resource allocated to each flexi-LSP is a frequency 
   range on a fiber link, the following information is needed as 
   parameters to perform resource allocation for the LSPs: 

   o Available frequency ranges: The set or union of frequency ranges 
      that are not allocated (i.e., available or unused) to flexi-LSPs 
      crossing the DWDM link. The relative grouping and distribution of 
      available frequency ranges in a fiber is usually referred to as 
      ''fragmentation'' and it is common design criterion for optical 
      resource control and management.  

4.2. Optical Transmitters and Receivers  

   In WSON, the optical transmitter is the wavelength source and the 
   optical receiver is the wavelength sink of the WDM system. In each 
   direction, the wavelength used by the transmitter and receiver along 
   a path shall be consistent if there is no wavelength converter in 
   the path.  

   In the case of flexible grids, the central frequency utilized by a 
   transmitter or receiver may be fixed or tunable. The slot width 
   needed by different transmitters or receivers may be different. 
   Hence, the changes introduced by flexible grid on fundamental 
   modeling parameters for optical transmitters and receivers from the 
   control plane perspective are:  

   o Available central frequencies: The set of central frequencies 
      which can be used by an optical transmitter or receiver.  

   o Slot width: The slot width needed by a transmitter or receiver.  

   Similarly, information on transmitters and receivers capabilities, 
   in regard to signal processing is needed to perform efficient RSA, 
   much like in WSON [WSON-ENCODE]. Additional modeling parameters are: 

   o Supported Input/Output Modulation formats and spectral efficiency 
      and reach, as well as Input/Output client signals. 

   o Supported FEC techniques.

5. Routing and Spectrum Assignment  

   A LSC flexi-LSP occupies a frequency slot, i.e. a range of frequency, 
   on each link the LSP traverses. The route computation and frequency 
   slot assignment could be called RSA (Routing and Spectrum 
   Assignment).  

   Similar to fixed grids network, if there is no (available) 
   wavelength converter in an optical network,  a flexible grid LSC LSP 
   (flexi-LSP) resource allocation will be subject to the ''wavelength 
   continuity constraint'', which is described as section 4 of [RFC6163].  

   Because of the high cost of the wavelength converters, an optical 
   network is generally deployed with limited or without wavelength 
   converters (sparse translucent optical network). Hence, the 
   wavelength/spectrum continuity constraint should always be 
   considered, and the possibility of wavelength conversion will not be 
   taking into account during the RSA process. When available, 
   information regarding spectrum conversion capabilities at the 
   optical nodes MAY be used by RSA mechanisms  

   The RSA should determine a route and frequency slot for a flexi-LSP. 
   Note that the mapping between client signals data rates (10, 40, 
   100... Gbps) and optical slot widths (which are dependent on 
   modulation formats and other physical layer parameters) is out of 
   the scope of the document. The frequency slot can be deduced from 
   the central frequency and slot width parameters as follows:  

   Lowest frequency = (central frequency) - (slot width)/2; 

   Highest frequency = (central frequency) + (slot width)/2.  

   Hence, when a route is computed (by the routing assignment process 
   or subprocess, RA) the spectrum assignment process (SA) should 
   determine the central frequency for a flexi-LSP based on the slot 
   width and available central frequencies information of the 
   transmitter and receiver, and the available frequency ranges 
   information of the links that the route traverses.  

   Figure 2 shows two LSC LSPs that traverse a link.

   The two wavelengths shown in figure 2 have the following meaning:  

   Flexi-LSP 1: central frequency = 193.1 THz, slot width = 25 GHz. It 
   means the frequency slot [193.0875 THz, 193.1125 THz] is assigned to 
   this LSC LSP.  

   Flexi-LSP 2: central frequency = 193.14375 THz, slot width = 37.5 
   GHz. It means the frequency slot [193.125 THz, 193.1625 THz] is 
   assigned to this LSC LSP.  

   Note that the frequency slots of two LSC flexi-LSPs on a fiber MUST 
   NOT overlap with each other.  

5.1. Architecture Approaches to RSA  

   Similar to RWA for fixed grids, different ways of performing RSA in 
   conjunction with the control plane can be considered. The approaches 
   included in this document are provided for reference purposes only, 
   other possible options could also be deployed.  

5.1.1. Combined RSA (R&SA) 

   In this case, a computation entity performs both routing and 
   frequency slot assignment. The computation entity should have the 
   detailed network information, e.g. connectivity topology constructed 
   by nodes/links information, available frequency ranges on each link, 
   node capability, etc.  

   The computation entity could reside on the following elements, which 
   depends on the implementation: 

   o PCE: PCE get the detailed network information and implement the 
      RSA algorithm for RSA requests from the PCCs.

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-requiements-01.txt         October 2011 
    

   o Ingress node: Ingress node gets the detailed network information 
      through routing protocol and implements the RSA algorithm when a 
      LSC LSP request is received.  

5.1.2. Separated RSA (R+SA) 

   In this case, routing computation and frequency slot assignment are 
   performed by different entities. The first entity computes the 
   routes and provides them to the second entity; the second entity 
   assigns the frequency slot.  

   The first entity should get the connectivity topology to compute the 
   proper routes; the second entity should get the available frequency 
   ranges of the links and nodes' capabilities information to assign 
   the spectrum.  

5.1.3. Routing and Distributed SA (R+DSA) 

   In this case, one entity computes the route but the frequency slot 
   assignment is performed hop-by-hop in a distributed way along the 
   route. The available central frequencies which meet the wavelength 
   continuity constraint should be collected hop by hop along the route. 
   This procedure can be implemented by the GMPLS signaling protocol.  

   The GMPLS signaling procedure is similar to the one described in 
   section 4.1.3 of [RFC6163] except that the label set should specify 
   the available central frequencies that meet the slot width 
   requirement of the LSC LSP, i.e. the frequency slot which is 
   determined by the central frequency and slot width MUST NOT overlap 
   with the existing LSC LSPs.  

6. Requirements of GMPLS Control  

   According to the different architecture approaches to RSA some 
   additional requirements have to be considered for the GMPLS control.  

6.1. Routing  

   In the case of combined RSA architecture, the computation entity 
   needs to get the detailed network information, i.e. connectivity 
   topology, node capabilities and available frequency ranges of the 
   links. Route computation is performed based on the connectivity 
   topology and node capabilities; spectrum assignment is performed 
   based on the available frequency ranges of the links. The 
   computation entity may get the detailed network information by the 
   GMPLS routing protocol.

   Compared with [RFC6163], except wavelength-specific availability 
   information, the connectivity topology and node capabilities are the 
   same as WSON, which can be advertised by GMPLS routing protocol 
   (refer to section 6.2 of [RFC6163]. This section analyses the 
   necessary changes on link information brought by flexible grids.  

6.1.1. Available Frequency Ranges of DWDM Links 

   In the case of flexible grids, channel central frequencies span from 
   193.1 THz towards both ends of the spectrum with 6.25 GHz 
   granularity.  Different LSC LSPs could make use of different slot 
   widths on the same link. Hence, the available frequency ranges 
   should be advertised.  

6.1.2. Tunable Optical Transmitters and Receivers 

   The slot width of a LSC LSP is determined by the transmitter and 
   receiver. The transmitters and receivers could be mapped to ADD/DROP 
   interfaces in WSON. Hence, the slot width of an ADD/DROP interface 
   should be advertised.  

   The central frequency of a transmitter or receiver could be fixed or 
   tunable. Hence, the available central frequencies should be 
   advertised.  

6.2. Signaling  

   Compared with [RFC6163], except identifying the resource (i.e., 
   fixed wavelength for WSON and frequency resource for flexible grids), 
   the other signaling requirements (e.g., unidirectional or 
   bidirectional, with or without converters) are the same as WSON 
   described in the section 6.1 of [RFC6163]. 

   In the case of routing and distributed SA, GMPLS signaling can be 
   used to allocate the frequency slot to a LSC LSP. This brings the 
   following changes to the GMPLS signaling.  

6.2.1. Slot Width Requirement 

   In order to allocate a proper frequency slot for a LSC LSP, the 
   signaling should specify the slot width requirement of a LSC LSP. 
   Then the intermediate nodes can collect the acceptable central 
   frequencies that meet the slot width requirement hop by hop.  

   The tail node also needs to know the slot width of a LSC LSP to 
   assign the proper frequency resource. Hence, the slot width

   requirement should be specified in the signaling message when a LSC 
   LSP is being set up.  

6.2.2. Frequency Slot Representation 

   The frequency slot can be determined by the two parameters, which 
   are central frequency and slot width as described in section 5. 
   Hence, the signaling messages should be able to specify the central 
   frequency and slot width of a LSC LSP.   

6.3. PCE 

   [WSON-PCE] describes the architecture and requirements of PCE for 
   WSON. In the case of flexible grid, RSA instead of RWA is used for 
   routing and frequency slot assignment. Hence PCE should implement 
   RSA for flexible grids. The architecture and requirements of PCE for 
   flexible grids are similar to what is described in [WSON-PCE]. This 
   section describes the changes brought by flexible grids.  

6.3.1. RSA Computation Type  

   A PCEP request within a PCReq message MUST be able to specify the 
   computation type of the request:  

   o Combined RSA: Both of the route and frequency slot should be 
      provided by PCE.  

   o Routing Only: Only the route is requested to be provided by PCE.  

   The PCEP response within a PCRep Message MUST be able to specify the 
   route and the frequency slot assigned to the route.  

   RSA in SSON MAY include the check of signal processing capabilities, 
   which MAY be provided by the IGP. A PCC should be able to indicate 
   additional restrictions for such signal compatibility, either on the 
   endpoint or any given link (such as regeneration points). 

   A PCC MUST be able to specify whether the PCE MUST also assign a 
   Modulation list and / or a FEC list, as defined in [WSON-ENCODE] and 
   [WSON-PCE]. 

   A PCC MUST be able to specify whether the PCE MUST or SHOULD include 
   or exclude specific modulation formats and FEC mechanisms. 

   In the case where a valid path is not found, the response MUST be 
   able to specify the reason (e.g., no route, spectrum not found, etc.)

6.3.2. RSA path re-optimization request/reply  

   For a re-optimization request, the PCEP request MUST provide the 
   path to be re-optimized and include the following options: 

   o Re-optimize the path keeping the same frequency slot.  

   o Re-optimize spectrum keeping the same path.  

   o Re-optimize allowing both frequency slot and the path to change.  

   The corresponding PCEP response for the re-optimized request MUST 
   provide the Re-optimized path and frequency slot. 

   In case the path is not found, the response MUST include the reason 
   (e.g., no route, frequency slot not found, both of route and 
   frequency slot not found, etc.) 

6.3.3. Frequency Constraints  

   PCE for flexible grids should consider the following constraints 
   brought by the transmitters and receivers:  

   o Available central frequencies: The set of central frequencies that 
      can be used by an optical transmitter or receiver.  

   o Slot width: The slot width needed by a transmitter or receiver.  

   This constraints may be provided by the requester (PCC) in PCReq or 
   reside within the PCE's TEDB which stores the transponder's 
   capabilities.  

   PCC may also specify the frequency constraints for policy reasons. 
   In this case, the constraints should be specified in the PCReq 
   message sent to the PCE. In any case, PCE will compute the route and 
   assign the frequency slot to meet the constraints specified in the 
   PCReq message. Then return the result to the PCC.  

7. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other 
   than those described in [RFC6163] and [RFC5920].
