               RSVP-TE extensions for services aware MPLS
               draft-fuxh-mpls-delay-loss-rsvp-te-ext-01

Abstract

   With more and more enterprises using cloud based services, the
   distances between the user and the applications are growing.  For
   multiple applications such as High Performance Computing and
   Electronic Financial markets, the response times are critical as is
   packet loss, while other applications require more throughput.  For
   example, financial or trading companies are very focused on end-to-
   end private pipe line latency optimizations that improve things 2-3
   ms.  Latency and latency SLA is one of the key parameters that these
   "high value" customers use to select a private pipe line provider.
   This document extends RSVP-TE protocol to promote SLA experince of
   latency and packet loss application.

Internet-Draft       RSVP-TE for services aware MPLS       November 2011


1.  Introduction

   End-to-end service optimization based on latency is a key requirement
   for service provider.  It needs to communicate latency of links and
   nodes including latency and latency variation as a traffic
   engineering performance metric is a very important requirement.
   [LATENCY-REQ] describes the requirement of latency traffic
   engineering application.

   This document extend RSVP-TE to accumulate (e.g., sum) latency
   information of links and nodes along one LSP across multi-domain
   (e.g., Inter-AS, Inter-Area or Multi-Layer) so that an latency
   verification can be made at end points and improve the user's
   experience.  One-way and round-trip latency collection along the LSP
   by signaling protocol can be supported.  So the end points of this
   LSP can verify whether the total amount of latency could meet the
   latency agreement between operator and his user.  When RSVP-TE
   signaling is used, the source can determine if the latency
   requirement is met much more rapidly than performing the actual end-
   to-end latency measurement.

   One end-to-end LSP may be across some Composite Links [CL-REQ].  Even
   if the transport technology (e.g., OTN) implementing the component
   links is identical, the latency characteristics of the component
   links may differ.  RSVP-TE message needs to carry a indication for
   the selection of component links based on the latecny constraint.
   When one end-to-end LSP traverse a server layer, there will be some
   latency constraint requirement for server layer.  RSVP-TE message
   also needs to carry a indication for the FA selection or FA-LSP
   creation.  This document extends RSVP-TE to indicate that a component
   links, FA or FA-LSP should meet the minimum and maximum latency value
   or maximum acceptable latency variation value.

   Packet Loss constraint will be taken up in a future version of the
   draft.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Performance Accumulation and Verification

   Latency accumulation and verification applies where the full path of
   an multi-domain (e.g., Inter-AS, Inter-Area or Multi-Layer) TE LSP
   can't be or is not determined at the ingress node of the TE LSP.

Internet-Draft       RSVP-TE for services aware MPLS       November 2011


   This is most likely to arise owing to TE visibility limitations.  If
   all domains support to communicate latency as a traffic engineering
   metric parameter, one end-to-end optimized path with delay constraint
   (e.g., less than 10 ms) which satisfies latency SLAs parameter could
   be computed by BRPC [RFC5441] in PCE.  Otherwise, it could use the
   mechanism defined in this section to accumulat the latency of each
   links and nodes along the path which is across multi-domain.

   Latency accumulation and verification also applies where not all
   domains could support the communication latency as a traffic
   engineering metric parameter.  The required latency could be signaled
   by RSVP-TE (i.e., Path and Resv message).  Intermediate nodes could
   reject the request (Path or Resv message) if the accumulated latency
   is not achievable.  This is essential in multiple AS use cases, but
   may not be needed in a single IGP level/area if the IGP is extended
   to convey latency information.

   Node latency for a WAN could be ignored or even an average, however
   that was not true for the LAN cases.  Whether the node latency should
   be accumulated or not depends on the implementation.

   One domain may need to know that other domains support latency
   accumulation.  It could be discovered in some automatic way.  PCEs in
   different domains may play a role here.  It is for further study.

2.1.  Signaling Extensions

2.1.1.  Latency Accumulation Object

   An Latency Accumulation Object is defined in this document to support
   the accumulation and verification of the latency.  This object which
   can be carried in a Path/Resv message may includes two sub-TLVs.
   Latency Accumulation Object has the following format.

      0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Latency Accumulation sub-TLV (from source to sink):It is used to
      accumulate the latency from source to sink along the
      unidirectional or bidirectional LSP.  A Path message for
      unidirectional and bidirectional LSP must includes this sub-TLV.
      When sink node receives the Path message including this sub-TLV,
      it must copy this sub-TLV into Resv message.  So the source node
      can receive the latency accumulated value (i.e., sum) from itself
      to sink node which can be used for latency verification.

   o  Latency Accumulation sub-TLV (from sink to source):It is used to
      accumulate the latency from sink to source along the bidirectional
      LSP.  A Resv message for the bidirectional LSP must includes this
      sub-TLV.  So the source node can get the latency accumulated value
      (i.e., sum) of round-trip which can be used for latency
      verification.  In the case of unidirectional LSP, this sub-TLV is
      absent.

2.1.1.1.  Latency Accumulation sub-TLV

   The Sub-TLV format is defined in the next picture.

     0                   1                   2                   3

             Figure 2: Format of Latency Accumulation sub-TLV

   o  Type: sub-TLV type

      *  0: It indicates the sub-TLV is for the latency accumulation
         from source to sink node along the LSP.

      *  1: It indicates the sub-TLV is for the latency accumulation
         from sink to source node along the LSP.

   o  Length: length of the sub-TLV value in bytes.

   o  Accumulated Estimated Latency Value: a value indicates the sum of
      each links and nodes' latency along one direction of LSP.  It MUST
      be quantified in units of micro-seconds and encoded as an float
      point value.

   o  Accumulated Estimated Latency Variation Value: a value indicates
      the sume of each links and nodes' latency variation along one
      direction of LSP.  Since latecny variation is accumulated non-
      linearly.  Latency variation accumulatoin should be in a lower
      priority.  It MUST be quantified in units of nano-seconds and
      encoded as an float point value.

2.1.2.  Required Latency Object

   A required latency could be signaled by RSVP-TE message (i.e., Path
   and Resv).  This object is carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object of
   Path/Resv message, object that is defined in [RFC5420].  Intermediate
   nodes could reject the request (Path or Resv message) if the
   accumulated latency value exceeds required latency value in the
   Required Latency Object.

   If the accumulated latency is not achievable, there is no necessary
   to accumulate the latency for remaining domain or nodes.  In order to
   balance the load across network links more efficiently if the
   absolute minimum latency is not required, intermediate nodes could
   choose a cost-effective path if the requested latency could easily be
   met.  Note that this would apply inter-AS if the IGP is extended to
   advertise latency.

   o  Required Latency Value: The accumulated estimated latency value
      should not exceed this value.  It MUST be quantified in units of
      micro-seconds and encoded as an float point value.

   o  Required Latency Variation Value: The accumulated estimated
      latency variation value should not exceed this value.  It MUST be
      quantified in units of micro-seconds and encoded as an float point
      value.

2.1.3.  Signaling Procedures

   When the source node desires to accumulate (i.e., sum) the total
   latency of one end-to-end LSP, the "Latency Accumulating desired"
   flag (value TBD) should be set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object of Path/
   Resv message, object that is defined in [RFC5420].  If the source
   node makes the intermediate node have the capability to verify the
   accumulated latency, the "Latency Verifying desired" flag (value TBD)
   should be also set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object of Path/Resv message.

   A source node initiates latency accumulation for a given LSP by
   adding Latency Accumulation object to the Path message.  The Latency
   Accumulation object only includes one sub-TLV (sub-TLV type=0) where
   it is going to accumulate the latency value of each links and nodes
   along path from source to sink.  If latency verifying is desired, the
   source node also adds the Required Latency Object to the Path
   message.

   When the downstream node receives Path message and if the "Latency
   Accumulating desired" is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES, it accumulates
   the latency of link and node based on the accumulated latency value
   of the sub-TLV (sub-TLV type=0) in Latency Accumulation object before
   it sends Path message to downsteam.

   If the "Latency Verifying desired" is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES,
   downstream node will check whether the Accumulated Estimated Latency
   and Variation value exceeds the Required Latency and Variation value.
   If the accumulated latency is not achievable, there is no necessary
   to accumulate the latency for remaining domain or nodes.  It MUST
   generate a error message with a "Accumulated Latency couldn't meet
   the required latency" indication (TBD by IANA).

   If the intermediate node (e.g., entry node of one domain) couldn't
   support the latency accumulation function, it MUST generate a error
   message with a "Latency Accumulation unsupported" indication (TBD by
   IANA).

   If the intermediate node (e.g., entry node of one domain) couldn't
   support the latency verify function, it MUST generate a error message
   with a "Latency Verify unsupported" indication (TBD by IANA).

   When the sink node of LSP receives the Path message and the "Latency
   Accumulating desired" is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES, it copy the
   Accumulated Estimated Latency and Variation value in the Latency
   Accumulation sub-TLV (sub-TLV type=0) of Path message into the one of
   Resv message which will be forwarded hop by hop in the upstream
   direction until it arrives the source node.  Then source node can get
   the latency sum value from source to sink for unidirectional and

   bidirectional LSP.

   If the LSP is a bidirectional one and the "Latency Accumulating
   desired" is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES, it adds another Latency
   Accumulation sub-TLV (sub-TLV type=1) into the Latency Accumulation
   object of Resv message where latency of each links and nodes along
   path will be accumulated from sink to source into this sub-TLV.

   If the LSP is a bidirectional one and the "Latency Verifying desired"
   is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES, it copy the Required Latency and
   Variation value in the Required Latency Object of Path message into
   the Resv message.

   When the upstream node receives Resv message and if the "Latency
   Accumulating desired" is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES, it accumulates
   the latency of link and node based on the latency value in sub-TLV
   (sub-TLV type=1) before it continues to sends Resv message.

   If the "Latency Verifying desired" is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES, it
   will check whether the latency sum of Accumulated Estimated Latency
   and Variation value in each Latency Accumulation sub-TLV exceeds the
   Required Latency and Variation value.  If the accumulated latency is
   not achievable, there is no necessary to accumulate the latency for
   remaining domain or nodes.  It MUST generate a error message with a
   "Accumulated Latency couldn't meet the required latency" indication
   (TBD by IANA).

   After source node receive Resv message, it can get the total latency
   value of one way or round-trip from Latency Accumulation object.  So
   it can confirm whether the latency value meet the latency SLA or not.


3.  Performance SLA Parameters Conveying

   [CL-REQ] introduces Composite Link into MPLS network.  In order to
   assign the LSP to one of component links with different latency
   characteristics, RSVP-TE message MUST convey latency SLA parameter to
   the end points of Composite Links where it can select one of
   component links or trigger the creation of lower layer connection
   which MUST meet latency SLA parameter.

   One end-to-end LSP (e.g., in IP/MPLS or MPLS-TP network) may traverse
   a FA-LSP of server layer (e.g., OTN rings).  There will be some
   latency constraint requirement for server layer.  RSVP-TE message
   also needs to carry a indication for the FA selection or FA-LSP
   creation.

   The RSVP-TE message needs to carry a indication of request minimum

   latency, maximum acceptable latency value and maximum acceptable
   delay variation value.  The end point will take these parameters into
   account for selection or creation of component link, FA selection or
   FA-LSP.

3.1.  Signaling Extensions

   This document defines extensions to and describes the use of RSVP-TE
   [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473] to explicitly convey the latency SLA
   parameter for the selection or creation of component link or FA/
   FA-LSP.  Specifically, in this document, Latency SLA Parameters TLV
   are defined and added into ERO as a subobject.

3.1.1.  Latency SLA Parameters subobject

   A new OPTIONAL subobject of the EXPLICIT_ROUTE Object (ERO) is used
   to specify the latency SLA parameters including a indication of
   request minimum latency, request maximum acceptable latency value and
   request maximum acceptable latency variation value.  It can be used
   for the following scenarios.

   o  One end-to-end LSP may traverse a server layer FA-LSP.  This
      subobject of ERO can indicate that FA selection or FA-LSP creation
      shall be based on this latency constraint.  The boundary nodes of
      multi-layer will take these parameters into account for FA
      selection or FA-LSP creation.

   o  One end-to-end LSP may be across some Composite Links [CL-REQ].
      This subobject of ERO can indicate that a traffic flow shall
      select a component link with some latency constraint values as
      specified in this subobject.

   This Latency SLA Parameters ERO subobject has the following format.
   It follows a subobject containing the IP address, or the link
   identifier [RFC3477], associated with the TE link on which it is to
   be used.

   o  I bit: a one bit field indicates whether a traffic flow shall
      select a component link with the minimum latency value or not.  It
      can also indicate whether one end-to-end LSP shall select a FA or
      trigger a FA-LSP creation with the minimum latency value or not
      when it traverse a server layer.

   o  V bit: a one bit field indicates whether a traffic flow shall
      select a component link with the minimum latency variation value
      or not.  It can also indicate whether one end-to-end LSP shall
      select a FA or trigger a FA-LSP creation with the minimum latency
      variation value or not when it traverse a server layer.

   o  Request Maximum Acceptable Latency Value: a value indicates that a
      traffic flow shall select a component link with a maximum
      acceptable latency value.  It can also indicate one end-to-end LSP
      shall select a FA or trigger a FA-LSP creation with a maximum
      acceptable latency value when it traverse a server layer.  It MUST
      be quantified in units of micro-seconds and encoded as an float
      point value.

   o  Request Maximum Acceptable Latency Variation Value: a value
      indicates that a traffic flow shall select a component link with a
      maximum acceptable latency variation value.  It can also indicate
      one end-to-end LSP shall select a FA or trigger a FA-LSP creation
      with a maximum acceptable latency variation value when it traverse
      a server layer.  It MUST be quantified in units of nano-seconds
      and encoded as an float point value.

   Following is an example about how to use these parameters.  Assume
   there are following component links within one composite link.

   o  Component link1: latency = 50 ms, latency variation = 15 ns

   o  Component link2: latency = 100 ms, latency variation = 6 ns

   o  Component link3: latency = 200 ms, latency variation = 3 ns

   o  Component link4: latency = 300 ms, latency variation = 1 ns


   Assume there are following request information.

   o  Request minimum latency = FALSE

   o  Request minimum latency variation= FALSE

   o  Maximum Acceptable Latency Value= 150 ms

   o  Maximum Acceptable Latency Variation Value = 10 ns

   Only Component link2 could be qualified.


   o  Request minimum latency = FALSE

   o  Request minimum latency variation= FALSE

   o  Maximum Acceptable Latency Value= 350 ms

   o  Maximum Acceptable Latency Variation Value = 10 ns

   Component link2/3/4 could be qualified.  Which component link is
   selected depends on local policy.


   o  Request minimum latency = FALSE

   o  Request minimum latency variation= TRUE

   o  Maximum Acceptable Latency Value= 350 ms

   o  Maximum Acceptable Latency Variation Value = 10 ns

   Only Component link4 could be qualified.


   o  Request minimum latency = TRUE

   o  Request minimum latency variation= FALSE

   o  Maximum Acceptable Latency Value= 350 ms

   o  Maximum Acceptable Latency Variation Value = 10 ns

   Only Component link2 could be qualified.

      Request minimum latency = TRUE

      Request minimum latency variation= TRUE

      Maximum Acceptable Latency Value= 350 ms

      Maximum Acceptable Latency Variation Value = 10 ns

   In this case, there is no any qualified component links.  But
   priority may be used for latency and variation, so one of component

   links could be still selected.

3.1.2.  Signaling Procedure

   When a intermediate node receives a PATH message containing ERO and
   finds that there is a Latency SLA Parameters ERO subobject
   immediately behind the IP address or link address sub-object related
   to itself, if the node determines that it's a region edge node of FA-
   LSP or an end point of a composite link [CL-REQ], then, this node
   extracts latency SLA parameters (i.e.,request minimum, request
   maximum acceptable and request maximum acceptable latency variation
   value) from Latency SLA Parameters ERO subobject.  This node used
   these latency parameters for FA selection, FA-LSP creation or
   component link selection.

   If the intermediate node couldn't support the latency SLA, it MUST
   generate a PathErr message with a "Latency SLA unsupported"
   indication (TBD by IANA).  If the intermediate node couldn't select a
   FA or component link, or create a FA-LSP which meet the latency
   constraint defined in Latency SLA Parameters ERO subobject, it must
   generate a PathErr message with a "Latency SLA parameters couldn't be
   met" indication (TBD by IANA).  These errors SHOULD also be generated
   if the node or the link were in unusable state for that particular
   service parameter.
