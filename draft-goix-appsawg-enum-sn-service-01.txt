Internet-Draft        Enum Service SN registration            March 2012


1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, [RFC6116]) is a system that uses DNS
   (Domain Name Service, [RFC1034]) to translate telephone numbers, such
   as '+44 01632 960123', into URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
   [RFC3986], such as 'acct:user@example.com'.  ENUM exists primarily to
   facilitate the interconnection of systems that rely on telephone
   numbers with those that use URIs to identify resources.

   Social Networking (SN) services allow users to post and retrieve
   activities (e.g. status updates or media uploads) and related
   replies.  [I-D.jones-appsawg-webfinger] is proposing a generic URI to
   identify an SN service account for a particular resource: the 'acct:'
   URI scheme.

   This document registers an enumservice for advertising SN information
   associated with an E.164 number.

1.1.  Justification

   The requirement to map an SN account with an E.164 number is from the
   Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Mobile Social Networking Enabler Release
   [OMA-MobSocNet-ER].

   In Mobile networks, users are traditionally identified through a
   Mobile Subscriber ISDN (MSISDN) number.  In order to provide SN
   functionality to mobile subscribers identified by their MSISDN, a
   mapping is needed to identify a corresponding SN account and
   provider.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  IANA Registration

   As defined in [RFC6117], the following is a template covering
   information needed for the registration of the enumservice specified
   in this document:

3.  Examples

   The following is an example of the use of the enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record for phone number +44
   01632 960123.

   $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.0.4.4.e164.arpa.

   IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sn" "!^.*$!acct:john.doe@example.com!" .

4.  DNS Considerations

   If no "E2U+sn" NAPTR record exist for the requested number, the
   resolution process over issuing ENUM queries may be recursively
   performed over E.164 numbers identified by other NAPTR records for
   the requested number pointing to "tel" URIs [RFC3966].  Whilst this
   process is useful to support, amongst others, number portability as
   per [RFC4769], Section 4, this may also create potential loops in
   this resolution process.  As such ENUM clients performing such ENUM
   queries over "tel" URIs to identify "acct" URIs SHOULD understand the
   "enumdi" indicator defined in [RFC4759].  In particular, if the
   result of the query does not include "E2U+sn" NAPTR records, and
   includes a NAPTR resource record containing a "tel" URI that has the
   same E.164 number, or a "tel" URI with the "enumdi" parameter set,
   that client SHOULD NOT perform subsequent ENUM queries over such
   numbers and SHOULD consider that the original requested number cannot
   be mapped.

   Furthermore the client MAY stop performing subsequent ENUM queries
   after the fifth recursive query as suggested in [RFC6116] section
   5.2.1.


5.  Security Considerations

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Should
   implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any other
   publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining PSTN
   Enumservice data, this information would be visible to anyone
   anonymously.

   As noted earlier, carriers, service providers, and other users may
   choose not to publish such information in the public e164.arpa tree.
   They may instead simply publish this in an internal ENUM
   infrastructure that is only able to be queried by trusted elements of
   their network, thus limiting threats.

   Per se, this enumservice does not introduce specific security
   considerations beyond [RFC6116], section 7.  However, it has to be
   acknowledged that the proposed Enumservice could lead to the
   discovery or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
   if used in combination with the WebFinger protocol.  Please see
   [I-D.jones-appsawg-webfinger], section 8 for additional information
   regarding WebFinger security to avoid unwanted disclosure of
   information.

   Similar security concerns are associated with potential attacks
   against an underlying Social Networking system.  Unlike a traditional

   telephone number, and as per the indirect nature of SN communication
   (typically through an intermediary network element), the resource
   identified by an 'acct:' URI may not be subject to direct
   communication with other peers.  However (e.g. in case of private
   message exchange) it may require that peers provide cryptographic
   credentials for authentication and authorization before messages are
   exchanged.  For this reason, SN protocols should have a number of
   security requirements that call for authentication, integrity and
   confidentiality properties, and similar measures to prevent such
   attacks.

   [As such, any Social Networking protocol used in conjunction with the
   'acct:' URI scheme is required to meet these requirements.  Question:
   is it the right place to say this?]


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the IANA registration of the Enumservice with
   Type "sn" according to the definitions in this document, [RFC6116]
   and [RFC6117].

   Details of the registration are given in Section 2.
