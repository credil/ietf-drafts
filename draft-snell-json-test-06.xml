<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction"> 

  <t>
    This specification defines JSON Predicates, a JSON-based <xref target="RFC4627"/> 
    syntax for the description and serialization of logical boolean predicate 
    operations intended to be used in conjunction with other JSON-based 
    mechanisms, such as <xref target="RFC6902">JSON Patch</xref>, as a means of 
    incorporating conditional processing.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    JSON Predicates can be used, for instance, to extend a 
    <xref target="RFC6902">JSON Patch</xref> document to provide for a 
    broader range of conditional processing options not currently supported 
    by JSON Patch.
  </t>

        "c": "ABC!XYZ"
      }
    }
  }
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <figure><preamble>The following JSON Patch with JSON Predicates document

    }
  ]

  <t>
    It is important to note this specification does not define a 
    distinct JSON Predicates Document format. Rather, it is the intent
    for JSON Predicates to be used within other JSON-based document
    formats.
  </t>

  <t>
    In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", 
    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
    are to be  interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
  </t>

<section anchor="predicates" title="Predicate Objects">

  <t>
    A JSON Predicate is a JSON Object whose members describe 
    a testable condition that evaluates as either
    true or false.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    The essential components of a JSON Predicate include:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        A label identifying the predicate operation,
      </t>
      <t>
        A reference to the value being tested, and 
      </t>
      <t>
        The condition against which the referenced value 
        is to be evaluated.
      </t>
  </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    Predicate objects MUST have exactly one "op" member whose value
    indicates the type of predicate operation to perform. It's value 
    MUST be one of: "and", "contains", "contains-", "defined", "ends", "ends-", 
    "in", "in-", "less", "matches", "matches-", "more", "not", "or", "starts", 
    "starts-", "test", "test-", "type", or "undefined". The semantics for each 
    are defined in the sections that follow.
  </t>  
  
  <t>
    Note that the value of the "op" member is case-sensitive and that
    each of the operations listed are in lower-case. The value "Starts",
    for example, is not equivalent to "starts".
  </t>
  
  <t>
    If the "op" member specifies any value other than one of those 
    listed above, the evaluation of the predicate operation MUST cease
    and be handled as if a boolean value of "false" was returned. The 
    application processing the predicate operation MAY signal that an 
    error condition has occurred depending on the specific requirements
    of the application within which JSON Predicates are being used.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    The remaining structure of each predicate operation depends on the
    specific type. There are two basic types of predicates.
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>
        First Order Predicates that are used to test one name value pair 
        against a single condition, and
      </t>
      <t>
        Second Order Predicates that aggregate one or 
        more subordinate First or Second Order Predicates.
      </t>
  </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    In addition to the required "op" member, First Order Predicates 
    have exactly one "path" member whose value MUST be a string 
    containing a <xref target="RFC6901">JSON-Pointer</xref> value referencing 
    the name value pair that is to be tested. If the "path" 
    member is not specified within the predicate object, it's value is 
    assumed to be an empty string.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    Second Order Predicates MUST have exactly one "apply" member
    whose value is a JSON Array containing one or more First or 
    Second Order Predicate Objects.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    Additional members can be required depending on the specific 
    predicate operation. All other members not explicitly defined by
    this specification MUST be ignored.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    Note that the ordering of members in JSON objects is not significant;
    therefore the following operations are equivalent:
  </t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
{"op": "contains", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": "ABC"}
{"path": "/a/b/c", "op": "contains", "value": "ABC"}
{"value": "ABC", "path": "/a/b/c", "op": "contains"}
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <section anchor="context" title="Predicate Context">
    
    <t>
      All JSON Predicates are evaluated against a given base
      context. The nature of this context is dependent entirely
      on the application within which JSON Predicates is being 
      used. For instance, when used together with JSON Patch, 
      the JSON Predicate operations are evaluated relative to 
      the JSON document that is the target of the JSON Patch
      operation.
    </t>
      
    <t>
      Although Predicate Objects use JSON Pointer references
      to identify values against which a predicate operation 
      is evaluated, the base context is not required to be 
      a JSON object or array. In such cases, however, it is 
      the responsibility of the application implementation to 
      determine how to interpret the JSON Pointer reference
      relative to the base context.
    </t>

  <section anchor="first-order-predicates" title="First Order Predicates">
    
    <section anchor="contains" title="&quot;contains&quot; and &quot;contains-&quot;">
  
      <t>
        The "contains" predicate evaluates as true if the referenced element 
        is defined and has a value whose string representation contains the 
        exact sequence of characters given by the predicate object's "value" 
        member.

        <t>
          The Predicate Object specifies an unknown predicate operation, or

        <t>
          The Predicate Object specifies a JSON Pointer referencing

  <section anchor="json-patch" title="Using JSON Predicates within JSON Patch Documents">
    
    <t>While JSON Predicate objects can be used in a variety of applications, 
    the syntax has been specifically designed for compatibility with the 
    JSON Patch Document format. JSON Predicate objects MAY be used directly
    within a JSON Patch Document as tests to evaluate whether or not the 
    application of a set of patch operations should succeed or fail.</t>
    
    <t>Because of requirements defined by the JSON Patch specification, 
    when Second Order Predicates are used as patch test operations within 
    a JSON Patch document, the "path" member MUST be specified. The value 
    of the "path" member MAY be an empty string.</t>
    
    <figure><preamble>For example, given the following JSON document:</preamble>
    <artwork>
{
  "a": {
    "b": {
      "c": "123"
    }
  }
}
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <figure><preamble>The following JSON Patch + JSON Predicates document will 
      first test that the path "/a/b/c" references a string value matching the 
      given regular expression prior to replacing that value:</preamble><artwork>
[
  {
    "op": "and",
    "path": "/a/b/c",

    "path": "/a/b/c",
    "value": "ABC"
  }
]
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>When a JSON Predicate object within a JSON Patch document evaluates as 
    false, processing of the JSON Patch Document MUST be handled exactly the 
    same as an unsuccessful JSON Patch operation would be handled as defined 
    in <xref target="RFC6902">JSON-PATCH</xref>. Specifically, processing of 
    the JSON Patch document SHOULD terminate and application of the entire 
    patch document SHALL NOT be deemed successful.</t>
    
    <t>The MIME media type "application/json-patch-test" is used to identify 
    JSON Patch documents that contain predicates.</t>
  
    <t>For example:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  PATCH /some-document HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.org
  Content-Type: application/json-patch-test+json

      "op": "replace",
      "path": "/a/b/c",
      "value": "ABC"
    }
  ] 
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>JSON Patch implementations that do not implement or recognize
    JSON Predicate objects will treat them as unknown patch operations 
    that will cause evaluation of the Patch document to fail.</t>
    
    <section title="Conditional Patch Operations">
      
      <t>In addition to being included as top-level operations within
        a JSON Patch Document, Predicate objects can be used to make
        conditional JSON Patch Operations through the use of the 
        optional "if" and "unless" properties.</t>
        
      <t>For instance, in the following example, the value at path 
      "/a/b/0" is only removed if the value at path "/a/b" is an Array.</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
  PATCH /some-document HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.org
  Content-Type: application/json-patch-test+json
  
  [
    {
      "op": "remove",
      "path": "/a/b/0",
      "if": {
        "op": "type",
        "path": "/a/b",
        "value": "array"
      }
    }
  ]
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>Unlike a typical JSON Patch operation, however, the 
      processing of the complete Patch document does not 
      fail if the stated condition is not met. The operation
      is considered to be successful even if the stated
      modification is not performed and processing will continue.</t>
      
      <t>In the following example, the value at path "/a/b/0" is 
      removed unless the value at path "/a/b" is undefined and 
      missing.</t>
      
      <figure><artwork>
  PATCH /some-document HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.org
  Content-Type: application/json-patch-test
  
  [
    {
      "op": "remove",
      "path": "/a/b/0",

        "op": "undefined",
        "path": "/a/b"
      }
    }
  ]
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>In a normal JSON Patch document without using predicates, 
      processing of the "remove" operation would cease and an error
      would be reported. Using the "if" and "unless" properties, the 
      error condition can be avoided and compensated for using a 
      combination of operations. For instance, in the following example
      the patch document ensures that the "/a/b" path exists and is 
      an array before attempting to add new items. If the existing 
      value of "/a/b" is not an array, it's value is changed to an 
      array prior to adding items, ensuring that the second "add" 
      operation will succeed.</t>
