Internet-Draft               JSON Namespaces                October 2011


1.  Introduction

   JavaScript Object Notation [JSON] is a text format for the
   serialization of structured data, derived from the object literals of
   the JavaScript programming language.  Unlike the Extensible Markup
   Language [XML], JSON does not provide methods for qualifying variable
   names, as XML does for elements and attributes [XML-NAMES].  However,
   in certain circumstances such namespaces can be useful.  Therefore,
   this document defines a convention for namespaced variable names in
   JSON data.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Feedback is welcome on the apps-discuss@ietf.org mailing list.


2.  Namespace Convention

   Various approaches have been proposed to namespaces (or "distributed
   extensibility") in JSON, from a centralized registry of variable
   names to prefixing with the "reverse domain name" of the namespace
   owner (e.g., "com.example.foo").  All of these approaches are
   preferable to use of the "x-" prefix [XDASH] or a similar
   construction, since they provides attribution and traceability for
   each namespace.  The convention described here follows "Clark
   Notation" [CLARK] by preceding a variable name with a Uniform
   Resource Identifier [URI] enclosed in curly brackets ('{' and '}').
   The use of URIs provides improved re-use of data models across
   existing representations, especially with XML when qualified by XML
   namespaces.

   In JSON, a variable name that is namespaced in this way is the
   "string" production when appearing as the first part of the "member"
   production, as those productions are defined in [JSON].  An example
   follows.

        {http://example.com/foo}bar

   Namespace names MUST NOT include the characters '{' and '}'.


3.  When and How to Use JSON Namespaces

   The convention described here is not intended for use in "standalone"
   JSON objects, especially those defined by a JSON schema

   [JSON-SCHEMA].  Instead, it is intended for use when a particular
   variable is likely to be re-used or interleaved within data that
   represents other JSON objects.  The following example shows a
   namespaced variable name used within an OAuth access token [OAUTH].

        {
          "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
          "token_type":"example",
          "expires_in":3600,
          "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
          "{http://example.com/foo}bar":"baz"
        }

   Namespaces MUST NOT be used for core JSON attributes (such as 'char'
   and 'number').

   An application MUST ignore namespaced variables that it does not
   understand, where by "ignore" is meant "discard the data without
   acting upon it or returning an error to the sender".


4.  Security Considerations

   This convention introduces no security concerns beyond those
   described in [JSON].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no actions of the IANA.
