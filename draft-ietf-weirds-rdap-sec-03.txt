1.  Introduction

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is specified in multiple
   documents, including "Registration Data Access Protocol Lookup
   Format" [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query], "JSON Responses for the
   Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)"
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response], and "HTTP usage in the Registration
   Data Access Protocol (RDAP)" [I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http].

   One goal of RDAP is to provide security services that do not exist in
   the WHOIS [RFC3912] protocol, including authentication,
   authorization, availability, data confidentiality, and data
   integrity.  This document describes how each of these services is
   achieved by RDAP.  Where applicable, informational references to
   requirements for a WHOIS replacement service [RFC3707] are noted.

3.  Information Security Services and RDAP

   RDAP itself does not include native security services.  Instead, RDAP
   relies on features that are available in other protocol layers to
   provide needed security services including authentication,
   authorization, availability, data confidentiality, and data
   integrity.  A description of each of these security services can be
   found in "Internet Security Glossary, Version 2" [RFC4949].  No
   requirements have been identified for other security services.

3.1.  Authentication

   WHOIS does not provide features to identify and authenticate clients.
   As noted in section 3.1.4.2 of "Cross Registry Internet Service
   Protocol (CRISP) Requirements" [RFC3707], there is utility in
   allowing server operators to offer "varying degrees of access
   depending on policy and need".  Clients have to be identified and
   authenticated to provide that utility.

   RDAP MUST include an authentication framework that can accommodate
   anonymous access as well as verification of identities using a range
   of authentication methods and credential services.  To that end, RDAP
   clients and servers MUST implement the authentication framework
   specified in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access
   Authentication" [RFC2617].  The "basic" scheme can be used to send a
   client's user name and password to a server in plaintext,
   based64-encoded form.  The "digest" scheme can be used to
   authenticate a client without exposing the client's plaintext
   password.  If the "basic" scheme is used, HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818]
   MUST be used to protect the client's credentials from disclosure
   while in transit (see Section 3.4).

   The Transport Layer Security Protocol [RFC5246] includes an optional
   feature to identify and authenticate clients who possess and present

   a valid X.509 digital certificate [RFC5280].  Support for this
   feature is OPTIONAL.

   RDAP SHOULD be capable of supporting future authentication methods
   defined for use with HTTP.

3.1.1.  Federated Authentication

   The traditional client-server authentication model requires clients
   to maintain distinct credentials for every RDAP server.  This
   situation can become unwieldy as the number of RDAP servers
   increases.  Federated authentication mechanisms allow clients to use
   one credential to access multiple RDAP servers and reduce client
   credential management complexity.  RDAP MAY include a federated
   authentication mechanism that permits a client to access multiple
   RDAP servers in the same federation with one credential.

   Federated authentication mechanisms used by RDAP are OPTIONAL.  If
   used, they MUST be fully supported by HTTP.  OAuth, OpenID, and CA-
   based mechanisms are three possible approaches to provide federated
   authentication.

   The OAuth authorization framework [RFC6749] describes a method for
   users to access protected web resources without having to hand out
   their credentials.  Instead, clients supply access tokens issued by
   an authorization server with the permission of the resource owner.
   Using OAuth, multiple RDAP servers can form a federation and the
   clients can access any server in the same federation by providing one
   credential registered in any server in that federation.  The OAuth
   authorization framework is designed for use with HTTP and thus can be
   used with RDAP.

   OpenID [OpenID] is a decentralized single sign-on authentication
   system that allows users to log in at web sites with one ID instead
   of having to create multiple unique accounts.  An end user can freely
   choose which OpenID provider to use, and can preserve their
   Identifier if they switch OpenID providers.

   Section 7.4.6 of the Transport Layer Security Protocol [RFC5246]
   describes the specification of a client certificate.  Clients who
   possess and present a valid X.509 digital certificate, issued by an
   entity called "Certification Authority" (CA), could be identified and
   authenticated by a server who trusts the corresponding CA.  A
   certificate authentication method can be used to achieve federated
   authentication in which multiple RDAP servers all trust the same CAs
   and then any client with a certificate issued by a trusted CA can
   access any RDAP server in the federation.  This certificate-based
   mechanism is supported by HTTPS and can be introduced into RDAP.

3.2.  Authorization

   WHOIS does not provide services to grant different levels of access
   to clients based on a client's authenticated identity.  As noted in
   section 3.1.4.2 of "Cross Registry Internet Service Protocol (CRISP)
   Requirements" [RFC3707], there is utility in allowing server
   operators to offer "varying degrees of access depending on policy and
   need".  Access control decisions can be made once a client's identity
   has been established and authenticated (see Section 3.1).

   RDAP MUST include an authorization framework that is capable of
   providing granular (per registration data object) access controls
   according to the policies of the operator.  Server operators will
   offer varying degrees of access depending on policy and need in
   conjunction with the authentication methods described in Section 3.1.
   Some examples:

   -  Clients will be allowed access only to data for which they have a
      relationship.

   -  Unauthenticated or anonymous access status may not yield any
      contact information.

   -  Full access may be granted to a special group of authenticated
      clients.

   The type of access allowed by a server will most likely vary from one
   operator to the next.

3.3.  Availability

   An RDAP service has to be available to be useful.  There are no RDAP-
   unique requirements to provide availability, but as a general
   security consideration a service operator needs to be aware of the
   issues associated with denial of service.  A thorough reading of
   "Internet Denial-of-Service Considerations" [RFC4732] is advised.

   An RDAP service MAY use a throttling mechanism to limit the number of
   queries that a single client can send in a given period of time.  If
   used, the server SHOULD return a 429 response code as described in
   "Additional HTTP Status Codes" [RFC6585].  A client that receives a
   429 response SHOULD decrease its query rate, and honor the Retry-
   After header field if one is present.

3.4.  Data Confidentiality

   WHOIS does not provide the ability to protect data from inadvertent
   disclosure while in transit.  Web services such as RDAP commonly use



Hollenbeck & Kong       Expires October 31, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           RDAP Security Services               April 2013


   HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818] to provide that protection by encrypting all
   traffic sent on the connection between client and server.  It is also
   possible to encrypt discrete objects (such as command path segments
   and JSON-encoded response objects) at one endpoint, send them to the
   other endpoint via an unprotected transport protocol, and decrypt the
   object on receipt.  Encryption algorithms as described in "Internet
   Security Glossary, Version 2" [RFC4949] are commonly used to provide
   data confidentiality at the object level.

   There are no current requirements for object-level data
   confidentiality using encryption.  Support for this feature could be
   added to RDAP in the future.

   As noted in Section 3.1, the HTTP "basic" authentication scheme can
   be used to authenticate a client.  When this scheme is used, HTTP
   Over TLS MUST be used to protect the client's credentials from
   disclosure while in transit.  If the policy of the server operator
   requires encryption to protect client-server data exchanges (such as
   to protect non-public data that can not be accessed without client
   identification and authentication), HTTP Over TLS MUST be used to
   protect those exchanges.

3.5.  Data Integrity

   WHOIS does not provide the ability to protect data from modification
   while in transit.  Web services such as RDAP commonly use HTTP Over
   TLS [RFC2818] to provide that protection by using a keyed Message
   Authentication Code (MAC) to detect modifications.  It is also
   possible to sign discrete objects (such as command path segments and
   JSON-encoded response objects) at one endpoint, send them to the
   other endpoint via a transport protocol, and validate the signature
   of the object on receipt.  Digital signature algorithms as described
   in "Internet Security Glossary, Version 2" [RFC4949] are commonly
   used to provide data integrity at the object level.

   There are no current requirements for object-level data integrity
   using digital signatures.  Support for this feature could be added to
   RDAP in the future.

   The most specific need for this service is to provide assurance that
   HTTP 30x redirection hints [RFC2616] and response elements returned
   from the server are not modified while in transit.  If the policy of
   the server operator requires message integrity for client-server data
   exchanges, HTTP Over TLS MUST be used to protect those exchanges.

4.  IANA Considerations

Internet-Draft           RDAP Security Services               April 2013


   This document does not specify any IANA actions.  This section can be
   removed if this document is published as an RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   One of the goals of RDAP is to provide security services that do not
   exist in the WHOIS protocol.  This document describes the security
   services provided by RDAP and associated protocol layers, including
   authentication, authorization, availability, data confidentiality,
   and data integrity.  Non-repudiation services were also considered
   and ultimately rejected due to a lack of requirements.  There are,
   however, currently-deployed WHOIS servers that can return signed
   responses that provide non-repudiation with proof of origin.  RDAP
   might need to be extended to provide this service in the future.

   As an HTTP-based protocol RDAP is susceptible to code injection
   attacks.  Code injection refers to adding code into a computer system
   or program to alter the course of execution.  There are many types of
   code injection, including SQL injection, dynamic variable or function
   injection, include file injection, shell injection, and html-script
   injection among others.  Data confidentiality and integrity services
   provide a measure of defense against man-in-the-middle injection
   attacks, but vulnerabilities in both client-side and server-side
   software make it possible for injection attacks to succeed.

   Data integrity services are sometimes mistakenly associated with
   directory service operational policy requirements focused on data
   accuracy.  "Accuracy" refers to the truthful association of data
   elements (such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers) in the
   context of a particular directory object (such as a domain name).
   Accuracy requirements are out of scope for this protocol.
