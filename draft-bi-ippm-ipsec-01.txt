               Network Performance Measurement for IPsec
                       draft-bi-ippm-ipsec-01.txt

Abstract

   IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable
   implementations.  Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly
   gaining popularity in several deployment scenarios, not the least in
   what used to be solely areas of traditional telecommunication
   protocols.  Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods that
   enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and
   two-way network performance.  Unfortunately, however, standard IP
   performance measurement security mechanisms cannot be readily used
   with IPsec.  This document makes the case for employing IPsec to
   protect O/TWAMP and proposes a method which combines IKEv2 and
   O/TWAMP as defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively.  This
   specification aims, on the one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be
   secured, while on the other hand, it extends the applicability of
   O/TWAMP to networks that have already deployed IPsec.

Internet-Draft  Network Performance Measurement for IPsec  February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The active measurement protocols OWAMP [RFC4656] and TWAMP [RFC5357]
   can be used to measure network performance parameters, such as
   latency, bandwidth, and packet loss by sending probe packets and
   monitoring their experience in the network.  In order to guarantee
   the accuracy of network measurement results, security aspects must be
   considered, otherwise, attacks may occur and authenticity may be
   violated.  For example, if no protection is provided, an adversary in
   the middle may modify packet timestamps, thus altering the
   measurement results.

   Cryptographic security mechanisms, such as IPsec, have been
   considered during the early stage of working towards the definition
   of the two protocols mentioned above.  However, due to several
   reasons, it was preferred to avoid tying the development and
   deployment of O/TWAMP protocols to such security mechanisms.  In
   practice, for many networks, the issues listed in [RFC4656], Sec. 6.6
   with respect to IPsec are still valid.  However, we expect that in
   the near future IPsec will be deployed in many more hosts and
   networks than today.  For example, IPsec tunnels may be used to
   secure wireless channels.  In this case, what we are interested in is
   measuring network performance specifically for the traffic carried by
   the tunnel, not in general over of the wireless channel.  Therefore,
   in this document we attempt to make the case that for networks where
   wide deployment of IPsec and other security mechanisms is mandatory
   for a variety of reasons, there are increasingly more use cases in
   which IPsec and O/TWAMP protocols are needed simultaneously.  In
   other words, we argue that it is now time to specify how O/TWAMP can
   be used in a network environment where IPsec is already deployed.  In
   such an environment, measuring IP performance over IPsec tunnels with
   O/TWAMP is an important tool for operators.

   Another advantage of IPsec key exchange protocol may be that it is
   not necessary to use distinct keys in OWAMP-Control and OWAMP-Test
   layers.  One key for encryption and another for authentication is
   sufficient for both the Control and Test layers.  This obviates the
   need to generate two keys and could reduce the complexity of O/TWAMP
   protocols in this environment.  This observation comes from the fact
   that separate session keys in Control and Test layers are designed
   for preventing reflection attacks when employing the current
   mechanism.  Once IPsec is employed, such a potential threat is
   alleviated.  Note that this will be very useful in the environments
   where IPsec capability has been supported.

2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Motivation

   Let us first consider why the reasons originally listed in [RFC4656]
   Sec. 6.6 may not apply today in many cases.  First, the argument made
   is that partial authentication in O/TWAMP authentication mode is not
   possible with IPsec.  IPsec indeed cannot authenticate only a part of
   a packet.  However, in an environment where IPsec is already deployed
   and actively used, partial authentication of O/TWAMP contradicts the
   operational reasons dictating the use of IPsec.  At the same time,
   this limits the applicability and use of O/TWAMP in networks using
   IPsec.

   The second argument made is the need to keep separate deployment
   paths between O/TWAMP and IPsec.  In several currently deployed types
   of networks, IPsec is widely used to protect the data and signaling
   planes.  For example, in mobile telecommunication networks, the
   deployment rate of IPsec exceeds 95% with respect to the LTE serving
   network.  In older technology cellular networks, such as UMTS and
   GSM, IPsec use penetration is lower, but still quite significant.
   Additionally, there is a great number of IPSec-based VPN applications
   which are widely used in business applications to provide end-to-end,
   or host-to-host security over IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs.  At the same
   time, lots of standardized protocols make use of IPsec/IKE, including
   MIPv4/v6, HIP, SCTP, BGP, NAT and SIP, just to name a few.

   Third, with respect to the support of IPsec in lightweight embedded
   devices, nowadays, a large number of limited-resource and low-cost
   devices, such as Ethernet switches, DSL modems, and other such
   devices come with support for IPsec "out of the box".  Therefore
   concerns about implementation, although likely valid a decade ago,
   are not well founded today.

   Fourth, everyday use of IPsec applications by field technicians, on
   the one hand, and good understanding of the IPsec API by many
   programmers, on the other, should not be anymore a reason for
   concern.  On the contrary: By now, IPsec open source code is
   available for anyone who wants to use it.  Therefore, although IPsec
   does need a certain level of expertise to deal with it, in practice,
   most competent technical personnel and programmers have no problems
   using it on a daily basis.

   O/TWAMP actually consists of two inter-related protocols: O/TWAMP-
   Control and O/TWAMP-Test.  O/TWAMP-Control is used to initiate,
   start, and stop test sessions and to fetch their results, whereas
   O/TWAMP-Test is used to exchange test packets between two measurement
   nodes.  In the following subsections we consider security for each
   one separately and then make the case for using them over IPsec.

3.1.  O/TWAMP-Control Security

   O/TWAMP uses a simple cryptographic protocol which relies on AES-CBC
   for confidentiality and on HMAC-SHA1 truncated to 128 bits for
   message authentication.  Three modes of operation are supported:
   unauthenticated, authenticated, and encrypted.  The authenticated and
   encrypted modes require that endpoints possess a shared secret,
   typically a passphrase.  The secret key is derived from the
   passphrase using a password-based key derivation function PBKDF2
   (PKCS#5) [RFC2898].

   In the unauthenticated mode, the security parameters are left unused.
   In the authenticated and encrypted modes, security parameters are
   negotiated during the control connection establishment.  Before the
   client can send commands to a server, it has to establish a
   connection to the server.  Then, the client opens a TCP connection to
   the server on the well-known port number 861.  The server responds
   with a server greeting, which contains the Challenge, Mode, Salt and
   Count.  If the client wants to establish the connection, it responds
   with a Set-Up-Response message, wherein the KeyID, Token and Client
   IV are included.  The Token is the concatenation of a 16-octet
   challenge, a 16-octet AES Session-key used for encryption, and a 32-
   octet HMAC-SHA1 Session-key used for authentication.  The token
   itself is encrypted using AES in Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC).

   Encryption is performed using a key derived from the shared secret
   associated with KeyID.  In the authenticated and encrypted modes, all
   further communications are encrypted using the AES Session-key and
   authenticated with the HMAC Session-key.  The client encrypts
   everything it transmits through the just-established O/TWAMP-Control
   connection using stream encryption with Client-IV as the IV.
   Correspondingly, the server encrypts its side of the connection using
   Server-IV as the IV.  The IVs themselves are transmitted in
   cleartext.  Encryption starts with the block immediately following
   the block containing the IV.

   The AES Session-key and HMAC Session-key are generated randomly by
   the client.  The HMAC Session-key is communicated along with the AES
   Session-key during O/TWAMP-Control connection setup.  The HMAC
   Session-key is derived independently of the AES Session-key.

3.2.  O/TWAMP-Test Security

   The O/TWAMP-Test protocol runs over UDP, using sender and receiver IP
   and port numbers negotiated during the Request-Session exchange.  As
   with O/TWAMP-Control, O/TWAMP-Test has three modes: unauthenticated,
   authenticated, and encrypted.  All O/TWAMP-Test sessions that are
   spawned by an O/TWAMP-Control session inherit its mode.

   The O/TWAMP-Test packet format is the same in authenticated and
   encrypted modes.  The encryption and authentication operations are,
   however, different.  Similarly with the respective O/TWAMP-Control
   session, each O/TWAMP-Test session has two keys: an AES Session-key
   and an HMAC Session-key.  However, there is a difference in how the
   keys are obtained.  In the case of O/TWAMP-Control, the keys are
   generated by the client and communicated (as part of the Token)
   during connection setup through the Set-Up-Response message.  In the
   case of O/TWAMP-Test, the keys are derived from the O/TWAMP-Control
   keys and the session identifier (SID), as inputs of the key
   derivation function (KDF).  The O/TWAMP-Test AES Session-key is
   generated by using the O/TWAMP-Control AES Session-key, with the 16-
   octet session identifier (SID), for encrypting and decrypting the
   packets of the particular O/TWAMP-Test session.  The O/TWAMP-Test
   HMAC Session-key is generated by using the O/TWAMP-Control HMAC
   Session-key, with the 16-octet session identifier (SID), for
   authenticating the packets of the particular O/TWAMP-Test session.

3.3.  O/TWAMP Security Root

   As discussed above, the AES Session-key and HMAC Session-key used in
   the O/TWAMP-Test protocol are derived from the AES Session-key and
   HMAC Session-key which are used in O/TWAMP-Control protocol.  The AES
   Session-key and HMAC Session-key used in the O/TWAMP-Control protocol
   are generated randomly by the client, and encrypted with the shared
   secret associated with KeyID.  Therefore, the security root is the
   shared secret key.  Thus, key provision and management are
   complicated and need to be taken care of appropriately.
   Comparatively, a certificate-based approach in IKEv2/IPsec can
   automatically manage the security root and solve this problem.

3.4.  Co-existence of O/TWAMP and IPsec

   According to [RFC4656] "[t]he deployment paths of IPsec and OWAMP
   could be separate if OWAMP does not depend on IPsec."  The problem
   may occur in practice is that the security mechanism of O/TWAMP and
   IPsec cannot co-exist at the same time.  IPsec provides
   confidentiality and data integrity to IP datagrams.  Distinct
   protocols are provided: Authentication Header (AH), Encapsulating
   Security Payload (ESP) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE v1/v2).  Only

Internet-Draft  Network Performance Measurement for IPsec  February 2013


   integrity protection can be provided with AH.  Both integrity and
   encryption can be provided with ESP.  The IKE Protocol is used for
   dynamical key negotiation and automatic key management.

   When the sender and receiver implement O/TWAMP over IPsec, they need
   to agree on a shared key during the establishment of the IPsec
   tunnel; subsequently all IP packets sent by the sender are protected.
   If the AH protocol is used, IP packets are transmitted in plaintext.
   The authentication part covers the entire packet.  So all test
   information, such as UDP port number, and the test results will be
   visible to any attacker, which can intercept these test packets, and
   introduce errors or forge packets that may be injected during the
   transmission.  In order to avoid this attack, the receiver must
   validate the integrity of these packets with the negotiated secret
   key.  If ESP is used, IP packets are encrypted, and hence no other
   than the receiver can use the IPsec secret key and decrypt the IP
   packet, and then it can obtain the test data to assess the IP network
   performance based on the measurements.  So both the sender and
   receiver must support IPsec to generate the security secret key of
   IPsec.

   In the current implementation of O/TWAMP, after the test packets are
   received by the receiver, it cannot execute active measurement over
   IPsec.  That is because the receiver knows only the shared secret key
   but not the IPsec key, while the test packets are protected by the
   IPsec key ultimately.  Therefore, it needs to be considered how to
   measure IP network performance in an IPsec tunnel with O/TWAMP.
   Without this functionality, the use of OWAMP and TWAMP over IPsec is
   hindered.

   Of course, backward compatibility should be considered, as well.
   That is, the intrinsic security method based on shared key as
   specified in the O/TWAMP standards can also fit the other platforms.
   There should be no impact on the current security mechanisms defined
   in O/TWAMP for other use cases.  This document describes a possible
   solution to this problem which takes advantage of the secret key
   derived by IPsec, to provision the key needed in RFC 4656 and RFC
   5357.


4.   O/TWAMP over IPsec

   A security method based on a shared secret key has been defined in
   O/TWAMP [RFC4656][RFC5357].  In this section, in order to employ
   O/TWAMP over IPsec, a method of binding O/TWAMP and IKEv2 is
   described, for those both the sender and receiver supporting the
   IPsec protocols.  The shared key used in the security of O/TWAMP is
   derived from IPsec [RFC5996].  If the AH protocol is used, the IP



Cui, et al.              Expires August 29, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Network Performance Measurement for IPsec  February 2013


   packets are transmitted in plaintext.  All of O/TWAMP is integrity-
   protected by IPsec.  Even if the peers choose to opt for the
   unauthenticated mode, IPsec integrity protection is extended to
   O/TWAMP.  In the authenticated and encrypted modes, the shared secret
   can be derived from IKE SA or IPsec SA.  If the shared secret key is
   derived from IKE SA, SKEYSEED must be generated firstly.  SKEYSEED
   and its derivatives are computed as per [RFC5996], where prf is a
   pseudorandom function:

   SKEYSEED = prf(Ni | Nr, g^ir)

   Ni and Nr are nonces, negotiated during initial exchange. g^ir is the
   shared secret from the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange and is
   represented as a string of octets.  SKEYSEED can be used as the
   shared secret key directly, then the shared key is equal to SKEYSEED.
   Alternatively, the shared secret key can be generated as follows:

   Shared secret key=PRF{ SKEYSEED, Session ID}

   wherein the session ID is the SID agreed during the O/TWAMP-Test
   protocol.

   If the shared secret key is derived from IPsec SA, the shared secret
   key can be equal to KEYMAT, wherein

   KEYMAT = prf+(SK_d, Ni | Nr)

   The term "prf+" describes a function that outputs a pseudorandom
   stream based on the inputs to a prf [RFC5996]; or the shared secret
   key can be generated as follows:

   Shared secret key=PRF{ KEYMAT, Session ID}

   wherein the session ID is the SID agreed during the O/TWAMP-Test
   protocol.

   There are some cases for rekeying IKE SA and IPsec SA, after which
   the corresponding key of SA is updated.  Generally ESP and AH SAs
   always exist in pairs, with one SA in each direction.  If the SA is
   deleted, the key generated from the IKE SA or IPsec SA should also be
   updated.

   As discussed above, a binding association between the key generated
   from IPsec and the shared secret key needs to be considered.  SA can
   be identified by SPI and protocol uniquely for a given sender and a
   receiver.  So these parameters should be agreed upon during the
   O/TWAMP protocol.  When the sender and receiver execute O/TWAMP
   protocol to negotiate integrity key, the IPsec protocol and SPI

   should be checked.  Only if two parameters are matched with the
   information of IPsec, should the O/TWAMP connection be established.
   As illustrated in Fig. 1, the SPI and protocol type are included in
   the server greeting of the O/TWAMP-Control protocol.  After the
   client receives the greeting, it closes the connection if it receives
   a greeting with an erroneous SPI and protocol value.  Otherwise, the
   client responds with the following Set-Up-Response message and
   generates the shared secret key.  This message exchange flow is
   illustrated as Fig. 1.

   Figure 2.  The format of server greeting

   In ESP, when the IP packets are encrypted, no other than the receiver
   can use the IPsec key and decrypt the IP packets.  It gains the test
   data to process measurement IP performance.  In this case, the IPsec
   tunnel between the sender and receiver provides additional security.
   Even if the peers choose the unauthenticated mode, IPsec encryption
   and integrity protection is provided to O/TWAMP.  If the sender and
   receiver also want to use authenticated or encrypted mode, the shared
   secret can be also derived from IKE SA or IPsec SA.  The method of
   key generation and binding association is the same as AH protocol
   mode.

   Besides, there is encryption-only configuration in ESP, though not
   recommended due to its limitations.  Since it does not produce
   integrity key in this case, either encryption-only ESP should be
   prohibited for O/TWAMP, or a decryption failure should be
   distinguished due to possible integrity attack.

5.  Others

   The community may want to revisit the arguments listed in [RFC4656],
   Sec. 6.6.  Other widely-used Internet security mechanisms, such as
   TLS and DTLS, may also be considered for future use over and above of
   what is already specified in O/TWAMP.


6.  Security Considerations

   As the shared secret key is derived from IPsec, the key derivation
   algorithm strength and limitations are as per [RFC5996].  The
   strength of a key derived from a Diffie-Hellman exchange using any of
   the groups defined here depends on the inherent strength of the
   group, the size of the exponent used, and the entropy provided by the
   random number generator employed.  The strength of all keys and
   implementation vulnerabilities, particularly DoS attacks are as
   defined in [RFC5996].


7.  IANA Considerations

   There may be IANA considerations for allocating additional value for
   these options.  The values of the protocol field needed to be
   assigned from the numbering space.


8.  Acknowledgments

   We would like to thank Eric Chen and Yakov Stein for their comments,
   and Al Morton for pointing to previous work discussed in IPPM WG.
