    I2RS working group is chartered to define an interface to the routing
    system. This interface can be used to read topology and forwarding 
    information of the routing system. This document discusses the
    use cases of I2RS in IPv4/IPv6 transition scenario.

	<section title="I2RS use case for IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack network">
	  <t>
	    There are several different ways for IPv4/IPv6 transition. For example,
	    dual-stack is one popular technology to enable IPv4 to IPv6 transition.
	    In dual-stack network, every router has both IPv4 and IPv6 IP stack
	    running on it. The IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stack running on the 
	    dual-stack router normally work independently from each other
	    although they share the same physical resources in the dual-stack
	    router(CPU,memory etc). There are two different views of the dual-stack network 
	    from the IPv4 or IPv6 perspective. There are different set of routing information
	    base for IPv4 and IPv6. In most cases, the IPv4 and IPv6 network need to have
	    the same topology and forwarding state since they normally serves for the same
	    dusal-stack host.

	  <t>
	  	It is a big challenge for the operators to operate dual-stack network, there are 
	  	several reasons:
	  	1. The network operation and management team may not familiar with IPv6. They
	  	have to learn new knowledge and new tools for IPv6.
	  	2. There are two separate domains of the IPv4 and IPv6 network, the trouble shooting
	  	will become much more complex than single stack network.
	  	3. Since the IPv4 and IPv6 stack share a single physical router, the problem of one
	  	protocol stack may spread to the other stack.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  	With I2RS, it can help the network operator to maintain a consistent view of both the IPv4 and
	  	IPv6 network in real time. The network operator can even configure the IPv6 network based on
	  	the existing IPv4 network and make the IPv4 network and the IPv6 have the same topology and
	  	forwarding state. This will reduce the complexity of operation and management and help the
	  	network operator discovery the in-consistent between the IPv4 and IPv6 network quickly.
	  </t>

  <section title="I2RS use case in IPv4 and IPv6 translation scenario">
  	<t>
  		In IPv4 and IPv6 translation scenario, the IPv4/IPv6 network's packets will
  		be translated in to IPv4/IPv6 network's packets and vice versa. It is 
  		difficult for the network management system to get a consistent view of the
  		translated network.

  	<t>
  		It is difficult for the current network management system to get IPv4 and
  		IPv6 network topology and routing information simultaneously. With I2RS,
  		it can provide a flexible way to get both IPv4 and IPv6 network topology
  		and other information, hence it could be very useful for trouble shooting
  		and network management.
  	</t>
  </section>
  
  <section title="Requirement for I2RS from the use case">
  	<t>
  		From the above use case, the requirements for I2RS are:
  		
  		1. I2RS interface should support both IPv4 and IPv6. It should be able
  		to read both IPv4 and IPv6 routing information in a timely manner.
  		
  		2. I2RS interface should have enough security mechanism to protect the
  		data that read from the routing information base.
  		
  		3. I2RS interface should have data consistent protection mechanism to
  		protect the data in the routing information base.
  		
  		4. I2RS interface should allow injection of routing polices to the
  		routing forwarding table.
  	</t>
  </section>
</section>
     
<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
  <t> 
  	Routing information is very critical and sensitive information for
  	the operators. I2RS should provide strong security mechanism
  	to protect the routing information that it could not be accessed
  	by the un-authorised users. It should also protect the security and 
  	integrity protection of the routing data.
