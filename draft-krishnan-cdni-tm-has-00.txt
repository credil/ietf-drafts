                 1. Introduction

   HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is an umbrella term for various HTTP-
   based streaming technologies that allow a client to adaptively switch
   between multiple bitrates depending on current network conditions.  A
   defining aspect of HAS is that, since it is based on HTTP, it is a
   pull-based mechanism, with a client actively requesting content
   segments, instead of the content being pushed to the client by a
   server. The underlying protocol used by HTTP is TCP/IP. This document
   presents the challenges in CDNi interface bandwidth provisioning,
   given the heavy asymmetric usage of the network between peak and
   quiet hours. The document [I-D.brandenburg-cdni-has-03] recommends
   various models for adaptive streaming aware CDN interconnection. This
   document complements the above document by recommending traffic
   management techniques which can offer the best adaptive streaming
   performance over CDN interconnections during hours of congestion.

                 2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document reuses the terminology defined in:

      [I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-statement-06],

      [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements-03],

      [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework-00], and

      [I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases-08].

                 3. CDNi interface bandwidth challenges

   Typically, the interface between CDNs is a long-haul backbone network
   where bandwidth is premium. The bandwidth needs of HAS is directly
   proportional to the number of active end users who are streaming
   video. The bandwidth requirements of HAS are quite asymmetric, with
   the bandwidth usage during peak family hours is substantially higher
   as compared to the normal hours. Caching in the CDN-I alleviates this

   to a certain degree, but we could have network congestion in the
   following scenarios 1) During peak hours, in a pull model caching,
   the first copy of many HAS streams would be delivered. 2) Long-tail
   personalized content, which is not amenable to caching, is desired by
   the end user. A naive solution would be to dimension the CDNi
   bandwidth for the peak hour usage and projected user growth which can
   lead to an expensive backbone network infrastructure. By using
   traffic management techniques described below, this issue network
   congestion issue can be alleviated by to a great degree and the
   backbone network need not be dimensioned for peak usage.

                 4. CDNi interface traffic management

   The CDNi interface links, which are typically long haul, have much
   lower bandwidth as compared to the links in the CDN. As discussed in
   the previous section, there is potential for congestion in the CDNi
   interface links especially during peak hours. The underlying protocol
   used by HAS is TCP/IP. In the standard router configuration, the
   default   congestion avoidance behavior for TCP/IP traffic is tail
   drop. Tail drop causes global synchronization of TCP/IP hosts or in
   effect the end users of HAS. Global synchronization occurs as waves
   of congestion crest only to be followed by troughs during which the
   CDNi interface link(s) are not fully utilized. Global synchronization
   of TCP hosts, for example, can occur because packets are dropped all
   at once due to tail drop. Global synchronization manifests when
   multiple TCP hosts reduce their transmission rates in response to
   packet dropping, then increase their transmission rates once again
   when the congestion is reduced. This leads to poor adaptive streaming
   performance when the CDNi interface links are congested especially
   during peak hours.

   Enabling Random Early Discard (RED) [RFC2309] on the CDNi interface
   links for HAS traffic, results in better adaptive streaming
   performance when the CDNi interface links are congested especially
   during peak hours. The following explains the WRED behavior in
   detail. RED aims to control the average queue size by indicating to
   the end hosts when they should temporarily slow down transmission of
   packets. WRED takes advantage of the congestion control mechanism of
   TCP. By randomly dropping packets prior to periods of high
   congestion, RED tells the packet source to decrease its transmission
   rate. The packet source is using TCP, or in effect the HAS end user,
   will decrease its transmission rate until all the packets reach
   their destination, indicating that the congestion is cleared. TCP
   not only pauses, but it also restarts quickly and adapts its
   transmission rate to the rate that the network can support. RED

   distributes losses in time and maintains normally low queue depth
   while absorbing spikes.

   Weighted Random Early Discard (WRED) is an improved version of RED
   which provides separate queue thresholds for different traffic
   classes, enabling the provision of different qualities of service for
   different traffic classes [RFC2474]. Using WRED, low priority HAS
   traffic may be dropped more frequently than high priority HAS traffic
   during periods of congestion. The example below demonstrates how WRED
   can be configured to improve HAS performance and offer differentiated
   services for different types of HAS traffic.

4.1. WRED Configuration Example

   As depicted in Figure 1, both CDN-A and CDN-B establish
   interconnections with CDN-C that acts as a dCDN.  Thus, CDN-C will
   cache the content for CDN-A and CDN-B.  When both CDN provider A and
   CDN provider B have agreements with the same CSP for content
   delivery, CDN-C may be required by CDN-A and CDN-B separately to
   retrieve and cache the same content from the CSP. WRED is enabled on
   the CDNi interface between CDN-A <-> CDN-C and CDN-B <-> CDN-C. The
   router configuration is depicted below.

4.1.1. Router buffering and queueing recommendations

   Amount of buffers needed = Round Trip Time (RTT) x link capacity of
   bottleneck link; in this case, the bottleneck link is typically the
   CDNi link

   The is a separate queue per <output port, priority>; typically there
   are 8 priorities

4.1.2. IP DSCP and Queue size mapping for IPv4 traffic recommendations

   Map HAS traffic to a IP DSCP Assured Forwarding (AF) class, e.g.
   class 3 (IP precedence 3)

   High priority HAS traffic

      Marked with low drop precedence e.g. AF31

      Queue threshold to trigger random packet drop - high value

      Drop probability - low value

   Medium priority HAS traffic

      Marked with medium drop precedence e.g. AF32

      Queue threshold to trigger random packet drop - medium value

      Drop probability - medium value

   Low priority HAS traffic

      Marked with high drop precedence e.g. AF33

      Queue threshold to trigger random packet drop - low value

      Drop probability - high value
