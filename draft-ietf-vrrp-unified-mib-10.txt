Abstract

   This specification defines a portion of the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with SNMP-based network management.  In
   particular, it defines objects for configuring, monitoring, and
   controlling routers that employ the Virtual Router Redundancy
   Protocol Version 3 for both IPv4 and IPv6 as defined in RFC 5798.
   This memo obsoletes RFC 2787.

1.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.   Introduction

   This specification defines a portion of the Management Information
   Base (MIB) for use with SNMP-based network management.  In
   particular, it defines objects for configuring, monitoring, and
   controlling routers that employ the Virtual Router Redundancy
   Protocol Version 3 for both IPv4 and IPv6 as defined in RFC 5798
   [RFC5798].

3.   Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.   Relationship to RFC 2787

   This document obsoletes RFC2787 [RFC2787]. The major changes in this
   document reflect changes in VRRP protocol between RFC 2338 [RFC2338]
   and RFC 5798 [RFC5798]. This document is also updated to conform to
   current MIB conventions.

5.   Relation to Interface Group (IF-MIB)

   Since a router can be participating in VRRP on one or more
   interfaces, "ifIndex" is used as an index into the tables defined in
   the VRRP MIB. This MIB module imports ifIndex from the IF-MIB. At
   this time, the latest version of IF-MIB is from RFC2863 [RFC2863].

6.   Multi-Stack Implementations

   This MIB module is designed to support Multi-Stack implementations

   that run VRRP over IPv4 and IPv6. IP version, VRID and ifIndex are
   used to uniquely identify rows in a multi stack implementation.

7.   Interpretation of RFC5798

   During the review of this document, It emerged that there are
   different possible interpretations of [RFC5798]. The Authors of that
   document and the VRRP working group were unable to reach consensus on
   which interpretation is correct. This document makes the following
   assumption.

   IPv4 and IPv6 virtual routers are treated as two separate logical
   entities and represented as two separate entries in the
   vrrpv3OperationsTable. This is required due to the undefined behavior
   of the protocol in [RFC5798] in a Multi-Stack scenario.


8.   VRRP MIB Structure and Design

   This MIB module contains three tables:
   (1)  The vrrpv3OperationsTable, which contains objects that define
        the operational characteristics of a VRRP router.  Rows in this
        table correspond to instances of virtual routers.

   (2)  The vrrpv3StatisticsTable which contains the operating
        statistics for a VRRP router.

   (3)  The vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrTable, contains the addresses of the
        virtual router(s) that a given VRRP router is backing up.

   Tables are indexed on ifIndex, VRID and the IP version to uniquely
   identify a VRRP router.

   Notifications in this MIB module are controlled using the mechanisms
   defined in [RFC3413].



9.   VRRP Multistack Scenario

   The following section provides examples of how some of the objects in
   this MIB are instantiated.

   The labels in the following tables and diagrams correspond to the
   actual MIB objects as follows:

   if      = IfIndex
   AddrType= vrrpv3OperationsInetAddrType
   VrId    = vrrpv3OperationsVrId
   State   = vrrpv3OperationsStatus
   Prior   = vrrpOpeartionsPriority
   IpAddr  = vrrpv3OperationsMasterIpAddr

   The following figure shows a hypothetical network with two VRRP
   routers VR1 & VR2, configured with two virtual routers.  Addresses in
   '()' indicate the address of the default gateway for a given host, H1
   to H4 are IPv4 hosts and H5 to H8 are IPv6 hosts. A, B and C are IPv4
   addresses and X, Y and Z are IPv6 addresses. In the diagram,
   "Interface" is used in the context defined in IF-MIB.

   NOTES:

   1)  For "State": M = Master;   B = Backup.
   In the vrrpv3OperationsTable, a "priority" of 255 indicates that the
   respective router owns the IP address, e.g., this IP address is
   native to the router (i.e., "the IP Address Owner").

11.   Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The objects vrrpv3OperationsPriority, vrrpv3OperationsPrimaryIpAddr,
   vrrpv3OperationsAdvInterval, vrrpv3OperationsPreemptMode,
   vrrpv3OperationsAcceptMode, vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus and
   vrrpv3AssociatedIpAddrRowStatus possess the read-create attribute.
   Manipulation of these objects is capable of affecting the operation
   of a virtual router.

   Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to:

   o The vrrpv3OperationsRowStatus object which could be used to disable
   a virtual router. While there are other columns that, if changed,
   could disrupt operations, they can not be changed without first
   changing the RowStatus object.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator

   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.



12.   IANA Considerations

      The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------

           vrrpv3MIB           { mib-2 ZZZ }

      [Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): The IANA is
      requested to assign a value for "ZZZ" under the 'mib-2' subtree
      and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When
      the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
      "ZZZ" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value.

      This document obsoletes RFC 2787 and the IANA is requested to
      deprecate the value 68 under 'mib-2' assigned to VRRP-MIB.]
