1. Problem statement 

    

  Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a widely deployed service to facilitate hosting 
  servers (e.g., to host webcam and http server) at home premises. 
  There are a number of providers who offer a DDNS service, working in 
  a client and server mode. DDNS clients are generally implemented in 
  the user's router or computer, which once detects changes to its IP 
  address it automatically sends an update message to the DDNS server. 
  The communication between the client and the server is not 
  standardised, varying from one provider to another, although a few 
  standard web-based methods of updating have emerged over time. 

  When the network architecture evolves towards an IPv4 sharing 
  architecture during IPv6 transition, the DDNS Client will have to not 
  only inform the IP address updates if any, but also to notify the 
  changes of external port on which the service is listening, because a 
  well know port numbers, e.g. port 80 will no longer be available to 
  every web server. It will also require the ability to configuring 
  corresponding port forwarding on CGN devices, so that incoming 
  communications initiated from outside can be routed to the 
  appropriate server behind the CGN.  

  This document focuses on the problems encountered when using dynamic 
  DNS in address sharing contexts (e.g., DS-Lite, NAT64, A+P). Below 
  are listed the main challenges to us:

Internet-Draft            PCP DDNS updates                   July 2012 
 
 
  (1)      The DDNS service MUST be able to maintain an alternative port 
  number instead of the default port number.  

  (2)      Appropriate means to instantiate port mapping in the address 
  sharing device MUST be supported. 

  (3)      DDNS client MUST be triggered by the change of the external IP 
  address and the port number. Concretely, upon change of the external 
  IP address, the DDNS client MUST refresh the DNS records otherwise 
  the server won't be reachable from outside. This issue is event 
  exacerbated in the DS-Lite context because no IPv4 address is 
  assigned to the CPE.   

  This document describes solutions to counter the issues listed above 
  in the particular case of DS-Lite. 

  Note DDNS may be considered as an implementation of the Rendez-vous 
  service mentioned in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]. 

  "After creating a mapping for incoming connections, it is necessary 
  to inform remote computers about the IP address, protocol, and port 
  for the incoming connection.  This is usually done in an application-
  specific manner.  For example, a computer game might use a rendezvous 
  server specific to that game (or specific to that game developer), a 
  SIP phone would use a SIP proxy, and a client using DNS-Based Service 
  Discovery [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd] would use DNS Update 
  [RFC2136][RFC3007].  PCP does not provide this rendezvous function.  
  The rendezvous function may support IPv4, IPv6, or both.  Depending 
  on that support and the application's support of IPv4 or IPv6, the 
  PCP client may need an IPv4 mapping, an IPv6 mapping, or both." 

  Dynamic Updates in the standard Domain Name System (DNS UPDATE) 
  (RFC2136) is out of scope of this memo. 

   

2. Solution Space 

2.1. Locate a service port 

  At least two solutions can be used to associate a port number with a 
  service identified: 

  (1)      Use service URIs (e.g., FTP, SIP, HTTP) which embed an explicit 
     port number. Indeed, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) defined in 
     [RFC3986] allows to carry port number in the syntax (e.g., 
     mydomain.example:15687)

Internet-Draft            PCP DDNS updates                   July 2012 
 
 
  (2)      Use SRV records. Unfortunately, the majority of browsers do not 
     support this record type.  

   

  DDNS client and server are to be updated so that an alternative port 
  number is also signalled and stored by the server. Requesting remote 
  hosts will be then notified with the IP address and port number to 
  use to reach the server.  

2.2. Detect the changes

  First of all, PCP MUST be used to install the appropriate mapping in 
  the CGN so that incoming packets can be delivered to the appropriate 
  server.

  either be running on a Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) or be running

  on the host that is hosting some services, itself.  There are 
  possible ways to address the problems stated in section 1. 

   

  (1)      If the DDNS client is enabled, the host issues periodically (e.g., 
  1h) PCP MAP requests (e.g., messages 1 and 2 in Figure 1) with short 
  lifetime (e.g., 30s) for the purpose of enquiring external IP address 
  and setting. If the purpose is to detect any change of external port, 
  the host must issues a PCP mapping to install a mapping for the 
  internal server. Upon change of the external IP address, the DDNS 
  client updates the records (e.g., message 3 in Figure 1).  

   

  (2)      If the DDNS client is enabled, it checks the local mapping table 
  maintained by the PCP client. This process is repeated periodically 
  (e.g., 5mn, 30mn, 1h). If there is no PCP mapping caused by PCP 
  client losing states for example, it issues a PCP MAP request (e.g., 
  messages 1 and 2 in Figure 1) for the purpose of enquiring external 
  IP address and setting up port forwarding mappings for incoming 
  connections. Upon change of the external IP address, the DDNS client 
  updates the records in the DDNS server, e.g., message 3 in Figure 1. 

 
3. Implementation & Validation                            

  So far the topology of network has been implemented as Figure 1. Based 
  on the DS-Lite environment some new roles added into it such as DDNS. 
  It could be implemented by Apache or other applications which has 
  virtual host functions. The DDNS need to be configured as a virtual 
  host and redirect corresponding request to the pointed IPv4 address 
  and port number. It could be validated as Figure 2 shows.

    DDNS: Maintaining mappings between domain name and external IPv4 
  address: port. If a DNS request was sent to it, DDNS server could 
  resolve it to the AFTR which contains that IPv4 address and port 
  number. 

    AFTR: Responsible for mappings between internal IPv4 Address: port 
  and external IPv4 address: port. It maintains a table to restore 
  these data to keep state of every mapping. 

    B4 (CPE): An endpoint of IPv4-in-v6 tunnel, and PCP client also 
  runs on it. A package from Web Server is encapsulated into a 
  IPv4-in-v6 one and is sent to the AFTR. A package from AFTR will be 
  decapsulated to a normal IPv4 package and to their destination.

    Web Server: Web server was deployed in the DS-Lite network 
  environment. It just has private IPv4 address and with a mapping in 
  AFTR to the public network. Web server may offer Web, FTP, SIP 
  service and so on. And these services may not be set as their 
  specific port. (this also is the reason why introducing DDNS into DS-
  Lite environment) 
    
    If the DDNS client is enabled, the A/AAAA records of DNS (which 
  could be normal one as using on the Internet now) were set to point 
  the DDNS Server. DDNS is responsible for the translation between 
  public IPv4 address (address of DDNS) with specific port (E.g. web 
  with 80 port) and public IPv4 address (outside IPv4 address and port 
  number of mappings). Show as Figure 3.

    If a user of another client outside DS-Lite network wants to 
  access a Web Server behind AFTR, the role of DDNS started to become 
  important. Before that the following mappings should had been 
  configured well: 

      a. PCP mappings: private IPv4 address: port number <--> public 
  IPv4 address: port number 

      b. DDNS mappings: public IPv4 address: port number <--> domain 
  name 
 
 
      c. DNS Resolution: A/AAAA Records (point to the DDNS server) <--> 
  domain name 

  A domain resolution request is sent from host of customer who 
  asking service. The request is sent to the DNS server. And DNS server 
  would return a DNS response with A/AAAA records pointing to the DDNS 
  server. If the request is sent to the DDNS directly, it would 
  redirect the request to the pointed IPv4 address and port number 
  which has been configured in the mappings. 

  After redirection the request is routed to the AFTR. AFTR would 
  translate it from public IPv4 address and port number into private 
  IPv4 address and port. The request finished AFTR translation and is 
  encapsulated into a IPv4-in-IPv6 package until CPE. 

  At last the request would be decapsulated to an IPv4 package and 
  is sent to the service provider. And the Web response would return to 

  the customer as requested routine. The whole communication process is 
  finished successfully. 

  From the view of Web visitor, the location of Web Server is on 
 
  DDNS, just like a virtual host. It at least has three advantages.

  Firstly, hackers and other attackers couldn't reach the real host and  
  do something bad. The security is assured. Secondly, many domain name  
  or space ISPs also provide service of domain and port mapping. However, 
  some companies may use iframe or 301 redirection technology. Those 
  means could lead to lower speed and affect PR weights to the search 
  engine. Click-through rate and visits was 'stolen'. That could not be 
  introduced into Carrier Scale Network. Hence, generation of DDNS has 
  its unique meaning. Thirdly, DDNS solution could solve the problems 
  of IP address + port mapping almost perfectly. Under DS-Lite network 
  environment normal DNS resolution couldn't point a domain name to a 
  IP address and a port. Because of designing defect of traditional DNS 
  protocol a DNS request just could be resolve to be a A/AAAA record 
  (the services have their own specific port. Such as web is 80 and ftp 
  is 21, etc.). So DDNS as a supplementary was introduced into DS-Lite 
  to play a role of mapping between domain name and IP address and port 
  number.
