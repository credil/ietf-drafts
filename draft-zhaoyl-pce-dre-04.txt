     Protocol Extension Requirement for Cooperation between PCE and
            Distributed Routing Controller in GMPLS Networks
                        draft-zhaoyl-pce-dre-04

Abstract

   Path Computation Element (PCE) is proposed for path computation in
   multi-layer and multi-domain networks where PCE can be implemented in
   either centralized method or distributed method.  In the former case,
   PCE can serve tens or hundreds of nodes simultaneously, while in the
   later case, each node is equipped with a PCE, which can be regarded
   as a distributed routing controller (DRC) in GMPLS networks and each
   one of those provides similar path computation capability.  PCE and
   DRC have different advantages in path computation respectively.  PCE
   is suitable for cross-layer and cross-domain path computation,
   especially in multi-constraints environment.  But distributed routing
   controller is good at path computation in parallel ways and
   distributed network control in local domain.  A cooperative path
   computation architecture named Dual Routing Engine (DRE) is necessary
   to be used in the future networks, for it based on the ideas of the
   cooperation of these two types of path computation engines and can
   take the advantages of both centralized and distributed method by
   which the PCE is implemented.  The corresponding PCE communication
   protocol extension and other protocol requirements for cooperation
   between PCE and distributed routing controller are listed in this
   document to recommend the standard interfaces between different
   components in DRE architecture.

1.  Introduction

   Path Computation Element (PCE) is proposed to complete the
   constraint-based shortest path computation in Multi-protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) multi-layer and multi-
   domain networks [RFC4665].  And a series of Request for Comments
   (RFCs) related to PCE technology, such as requirements for PCE
   discovery, PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP), a backward recursive
   PCE-based computation procedure (BRPC) and so on, have been
   standardized.  Studies have been proving that PCE is suitable for
   cross-layer and cross-domain design of networks, capable of end-to-
   end path computation under multiple constraints [1-2] and could be
   potentially applied to resource assignment and routing optimization
   [3-4].  PCE can be implemented either in centralized method or
   distributed method.  In the former case, PCE can serve tens or
   hundreds of nodes simultaneously. while in the later case, each node
   is equipped with a PCE, which can be regarded as a distributed
   routing controller (DRC) in GMPLS networks and each one of them
   provides similar path computation capability.  DRC in GMPLS/ASON
   control plane is good at the path computation in parallel ways and
   distributed network control in local domain.  On the other hand, DRC
   can also be used in the management and configuration of resource in
   internal node.  Becaues of that the huge bandwidth requirement is
   emerging, links with the transmission capacity of Tbit/s and
   switching at Pbit/s are necessary for next generation optical
   networks.  According to the level of current photonics technology
   level, the node's architecture should to be very complicated with
   large power consumption.  Therefore, how to configure the switching
   architecture in the node will be a very important issue for the
   entire network performance.  On the other side, of course, PCE and
   DRC has corresponding disadvantages respectively.

   In order to optimize the performance of optical networks under
   different application scenarios, PCE and distributed routing
   controller are needed to cooperate with each other.  A cooperative
   path computation architecture named Dual Routing Engine (DRE) is
   proposed, which includes two types of path computation engines, i.e.
   PCE and distributed routing controller, and can combine advantages of
   both of them.  In this document, several different application
   scenarios are described.  And PCE communication protocol extension
   and other protocol extension requirements for cooperation between PCE
   and distributed routing controller are also listed here.

3.  General Assumptions

   PCE and distributed routing controller are two path computation
   engines which have been standardized by IETF working group.  They can
   both complete the path computation in GMPLS networks.  In order to
   show how the cooperative architecture based on PCE and distributed
   routing controller works, some assumptions as follows should be made
   before.

   o  Each GMPLS-based control node is equipped with a distributed
      routing controller which can complete the path computation in
      local domain and even the path computation and resource
      configuration in the internal node, and each domain is equipped
      with no less than one PCE which can not only complete the intra-
      domain path computation, but also complete the inter-domain path
      computation.

   o  The topology and TE information are updated as soon as any change
      occurs in the network, and the information kept at PCE and
      distributed routing controller are synchronized by OSPF-TE.

Internet-Draft       Cooperation between PCE and DRC          April 2012


   o  PCE and distributed routing controller can be selected arbitrary
      according to the local routing strategy.

   o  Constraints and strategies can be considered by PCE during the
      process of the intra-domain path computation and the inter-domain
      path computation.

   o  An end-to-end path which crosses domains or crosses layers can be
      completed by several PCEs or several DRCs or several PCEs and
      DRCs.  For example, the section of an end-to-end path in one
      domain may be computed by PCE, but the other section of this path
      in another domain may be computed by DRC.


4.  Cooperative Architecture based on PCE and Distributed Routing
    Controller

   As shown in Fig. 1, cooperative architecture consists of Path
   Computation Element (PCE) and distributed routing controller (DRC).
   Both of them maintain Traffic Engineering Databases (TEDs) to keep
   network topology and other status information within the scope of
   their respective functions.  There is a function module named Routing
   Engine Selector (RES) at each control node, which is responsible for
   managing the switchover to process between PCE and DRC,and choosing
   the right one when a LSP setup request is arriving.  RES,as well as
   posses the function of PCC when cooperating with PCE and DRC,can be
   implemented in Connection Controller (CC) module of GMPLS-based
   control plane.

4.1.  DRC

   DRC offers general routing functions based on GMPLS/ASON control
   plane which included linking state adverting, topology updating and
   path computation.  A typical DRC contains two essential modules that
   are topology analysis module and path computation module.  The former
   floods network topology and resource utilization information to
   synchronize TED maintained on each node.  The latter responds to a
   routing request from Connection Controller (CC), finds the optimized
   path solution and returns it to CC.  Besides these general routing
   functions, DRC can also complete the resource allocation and
   configuration, which refer to internal resource allocation, ports
   interconnection, and switch fabric configuration in the internal
   node.  This function is getting more and more important as well as
   the structure of the internal node is getting more and more complex.
   Details of DRC's operation are out of this document's scope.

4.2.  PCE

   PCE is of particular advantage of centralized path computation in
   multi-layer and multi-domain networks, especially in multi-
   constraints environment.  There is a Client/Server model between RES
   and PCE.  When RES sends a TE-LSP computation request to PCE, PCE
   would perform path computation and returns the results back to RES.

   As shown in Fig.2, RES chooses the best PCE based on a certain policy
   first.  It sends performance query requests to multiple related PCEs,
   each of which evaluates itself individually and then feeds back to
   the RES.  RES gathers performance status information from PCEs and
   decides which PCE is feasible.  Thus a combination of RES and PCE is
   founded.  Secondly PCE deals with the path computation requests
   coming from RES by using the message parser.  A request will be
   delivered towards path computation module if it carries path
   information after the message parsing , otherwise , if it carries
   policy information from RES, it should be firstlly interpreted by
   policy parser along with local policy settings and then loaded into
   path computation module.  Finally path computation module implements
   multi-constraint routing on the basis of the path information, policy
   information and TE information.  If path computation is successful,
   the details of the whole route will be returned to RES.  If it only
   gets an incomplete route, a new application for path computation
   request will be sent to the next hop RES.  Then another PCE or DRC
   will be selected to complement the incomplete route.

5.  Different Application Scenarios

   Cooperation between PCE and DRC is one of the key issues in the
   cooperative architecture, for it helps to achieve fast and exact
   routing due to the advantages of both PCE and DRC.  This section will
   list several typical application scenarios of cooperation between PCE

Internet-Draft       Cooperation between PCE and DRC          April 2012


   and DRC.

5.1.  Cross layers and cross domains

   It is necessary for PCE to collaborate with DRC when the requirements
   for path computation occur in multi-layer and multi-domain GMPLS
   networks.  PCE could be shared among several domains or layers and
   make the best use of the inter-domain and inter-layer network
   resources, obviously it is more suitable for inter-domain or inter-
   layer path computation.  In contrast to PCE, DRC usually runs to
   fulfill intra-domain or intra-layer routing.

5.2.  Independent coexistence

   Both PCE and DRC are working independently under this scenario.
   While one customer applies a TE-LSP computation, the respective RES/
   RESs could select PCE or DRC arbitrarily.  Of course each time only
   one path computation engine can be selected.  If a lot of
   applications for path computation arrive simultaneously, the burst
   computing load may also be balanced between them according to the
   implementation of RES.  The changing of topology and resource status
   information should be maintained in PCE and DRC in time although it
   is difficult to manage the information synchronization on both sides.

5.3.  Security backup

   The cooperation mechanisms among different engines make it possible
   that PCE and DRC backup each other to enhance the routing security
   and reliability, since they both satisfy the demands of path
   computation from customers.  When the working engine (e.g.  PCE)
   fails, computation tasks could be switched to another reserved engine
   (e.g.  DRC) as soon as possible.  In such, a case both PCE and DRC
   should maintain the accordant network topology and resource status
   information.

5.4.  Policy-enabled

   In order to compute the optimal path in consideration of traffic
   engineering, different policies are implemented, which means there
   are series of rules and actions from management plane or control
   plane.  PCE is obviously more suitable for policy-enabled path
   computation framework than DRC.  Tab.1 lists some typical policy
   application instances that may be exerted to the cooperative path
   computation architecture.  New scenarios could occur as well as the
   effective combinations of the above scenarios in the real networks.

5.5.  Constraint-based

   Constraint-based path computation is a basic function especially for
   TE-LSP establishment.  Available bandwidth, diversity, Shared Risk
   Link Group (SRLG), optical impairments, wavelength continuity and
   other constraints are likely to be considered.  However, it is
   difficult to compute an optimal path with these constraints under the
   condition of the general GMPLS/ASON routing architecture.  The
   centralized operation manner makes PCE easy to fulfill constraint-
   based path computation.

5.6.  Service-oriented

   PCEs can collaborate to finish constraint-based path computation
   without sharing TE information with each other, which are
   particularly useful when end-to-end constraints have to be taken into
   account because of protection and the diversity of path.  PCEs should
   play an important role in service-oriented applications such as Layer
   1 Virtual Private Network (L1 VPN), Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) and so
   on.  Based on GMPLS/ASON architecture, the advantages of PCE and
   service plane can be combined to implement the framework of service-
   oriented application.

5.7.  Cooperation between network level and node level

   In this application scenario, PCE maintains Traffic Engineering
   Databases (TEDs) to keep network topology, and DRC maintains Resource
   Information Databases (RIDs) to keep node internal topology and
   resource status.  Both of them maintain the status information within
   the scope of their functions.  Routing Engine Selector (RES) is

   responsible for managing the switchover to process between PCE and
   DRC and choosing the right one when a LSP setup request arrives.

   The interconnection between different nodes is becoming a general
   routing problem, which can be solved by PCE framework effectively,
   especially in multi-domain, multi-layer and multi-constraints
   scenarios, while the interconnection within the node is the problem
   of resource allocation and configuration, which refers to internal
   resource allocation, ports interconnection, and switch fabric
   configuration.  Through the cooperation of PCE and DRC, we can make
   resource configuration more effectively and improve the performance
   of the entire optical networks.


6.  PCEP Extension Requirements

   As an extension of PCC, RES can not only complete the communication
   between PCE and DRC, but also complete the cooperation between PCE
   and DRC.  There are some requirements of PCEP extension for the
   cooperative path computation architecture and the procedure.

6.1.  PCEP extension requirements for the communication between RES and
      PCE

   PCEP is the communication protocol between RES and PCE.  However,
   there is some extension requirements of PCEP in the cooperative path
   computation architecture.

   Firstly, an identification which appoints different application
   scenarios should be added to the path computation request
   messages(PCReq) from RES to PCE, and the corresponding data structure
   should be defined according to different identifications.  For
   example, in the policy-enabled scenario, a policy object is necessary
   to be defined in the message sent from RES to PCE, and PCE should be
   able to parse the different policies and conduct the corresponding
   operations during the procedure of path computation.

   Secondly, in the reply message from PCE to RES, some indication
   information should be contained besides the routes information, such
   as the inter-domain loose path or the intra-domain path, the complete
   end-to-end path or section path, some failure information and path
   computation engine switchover requests.

6.2.  PCEP extension requirement for the communication between RES and
      DRC

   DRC can complete the path computation in local domain in the
   distributed method, which is usually implemented in the OSPF-TE

   module of GMPLS-based control plane.  After the path computation, DRC
   returns the computation results to RES (CC) including the detailed
   routes or some failure or indication information.

   As another important application, DRC can complete the path
   computation, resource management and configuration in the internal
   node even the node structure is getting more and more complex.  In
   this application scenario, DRC has the function of routing and
   resource allocation.

   In all the application scenarios, DRC has all the analogous functions
   with PCE and some different extension functions, such as the
   functions above.  So there is a requirement for application scenarios
   identification in the communication message between RES and DRC.  The
   communication protocol between RES and DRC is necessary to be
   standardized because of that the function of control node is getting
   more and more complex.  Because RES and DRC are implemented in the
   same control node and DRC has similar functions with PCE, a
   simplified PCEP can be used as the communication protocol between RES
   and DRC, which can include the path computation request,
   identification and reply messages only.


7.  Other Protocol Extension Requirements

7.1.  OSPF-TE extension requirement for the cooperative architecture

   In the cooperative path computation architecture, the topology and TE
   information should be kept and synchronized at each control node and
   PCE in local domain, and should also be updated as soon as any change
   occurs.  Meanwhile, all the inter-domain links and TE information
   should be kept and synchronized at each PCE.  So there is an
   extension requirement for OSPF-TE to guarantee the information at
   each node synchronized in time.

   Besides the normal topology and TE information, some other
   constraints information may be necessary to be contained in the
   OSPF-TE protocol flooding in the entire networks, such as the
   physical impairment information.  Then there is an extension
   requirement for the OSPF-TE protocol to enable the synchronization of
   all the constraint information at each node, which is of great value
   for the path computation and resource allocation.

7.2.  RSVP-TE extension requirement for the cooperative architecture

   In different cooperation modes between PCE and DRC, an end-to-end
   path may be computed by several PCE and DRC, and then be setup by
   signaling from the source node to the destination node.  However,



Zhao, et al.            Expires October 23, 2012               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       Cooperation between PCE and DRC          April 2012


   sometimes an end-to-end path which crosses domains or layers may be
   computed and setup section by section.  Signaling should be triggered
   when a section path is gained.  The current RSVP-TE protocol is
   necessary to be extended to support this application scenario.

   Furthermore, as the scheme of path and resource allocation in the
   internal node is gained, the resource reservation and action of
   switches are need to be conducted by some protocol as the control
   node is getting more and more complex.  RSVP-TE is the optimal option
   for this need, and to be extended.


8.  Discussions

   According to the development of GMPLS networks, the cooperative
   architecture can be introduced in two steps.  First, PCE and DRC can
   cooperate with each other to complete the path computation of the
   entire networks at network level.  Second, PCE and DRC can cooperate
   with each other to complete the path computation at network level and
   resource computation and allocation at node level with the scale of
   network increasing and the structure of node getting more complex.


9.  Security Considerations

   The cooperation between PCE and DRC can enhance the security of
   networks because they can backup each other.  However, because the
   information is kept at both PCE and DRC, especially in the condition
   of the exchanging of information across domain boundaries is
   necessary in the multi-domain operations, there are some security and
   confidentiality risks, which can be minimized through the inheritance
   of the security requirement defined [RFC5440] and [RFC5376].
