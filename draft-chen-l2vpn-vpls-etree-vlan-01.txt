Internet-Draft     Automatic VLAN allocation in E-tree        March 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes to use automatically allocated VLAN ID to
   indicate E-Tree attribute.  For the E-Tree requirement, please refer
   to [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-etree-reqt] for detail.

   In order to achieve better compatibility and traffic optimization,
   this document also introduces extensions to existing VPLS protocols
   as described in the document.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.


3.  Approach

   In order to be compatible with IEEE defined E-Tree, the approach in
   this draft uses the VLAN ID to indicate Root/Leaf attribute of the
   frame.

   There are two ways to manipulate VLANs for an E-Tree in VPLS:
   o  Static configuring VLAN in IEEE, the Root/Leaf VLAN should co-
      ordinate manually or by management plane to be configured same on
      all the PEs in VPLS;
   o  Unlike static configuring VLAN in IEEE, VPLS PE has the capability
      to create VLAN ID automatically, e.g.  The VLAN ID can be derived
      from the PW type/AGI automatically via some algorithm;

   Regarding some VPLS PEs have single VLAN space without VLAN
   translation, and only support VLAN mapping to VPLS instance, and then
   if these PEs want to support VPLS E-tree, static configuring VLAN in
   IEEE would be used.

   Regarding some VPLS PEs support multiple VLAN spaces, then if these
   PEs want to support VPLS E-tree, an optimized approach would be used,
   which is automatic allocated VLAN.  Unlike static configuring VLAN ID
   in IEEE, VPLS PE has the capability to create VLAN ID automatically,
   e.g.  The VLAN ID can be derived from the PW type/AGI automatically
   via some algorithm.  As part of VLAN auto-derive procedure, operators
   only need to configure the AC Leaf/Root properties, and not necessary
   to care about the exact VLAN number.  One VLAN ID(Root VLAN ID) is
   used to indicate the frame originated from the Root AC and the other
   VLAN ID(Leaf VLAN ID) is used to indicate the frame originated from
   the Leaf AC between the pair of the PEs.

                                 Figure 1

   As shown in figure 1, the VPLS PE1 and PE2 can both be attached with
   root/leaf AC, the VLANs which is used to indicate the Root/leaf can
   be derived from the PW type/AGI automatically.

   When PE1 receives a frame via the Root AC, PE1 can add the Root VLAN
   ID.  When PE2 receives the frame from PE1 via the Ethernet PW, PE2
   knows the frame originated from the Root, so it can forward the frame
   to AC3(Root AC) and AC4 (Leaf AC).

   When PE1 receives a frame via the Leaf AC, PE1 can add the leaf VLAN
   ID.  When PE2 receives the frame from PE1 via the Ethernet PW, PE2
   knows the frame originated from the Leaf, so it can forward the frame
   to AC3 (Root AC) but it must not be forwarded to any Leaf AC.

   The approach allows the egress PE to make a decision whether the
   frame can be forwarded or dropped towards a leaf AC.  But in some
   special scenarios, e.g. one of the VPLS PE is attached with only
   leaves, some optimization should be done on the ingress PE to make a
   decision whether this frame should be forwarded or dropped.  Such
   kind of mechanism can improve the bandwidth efficiency.  The
   extension to VPLS for the PE attached with leaves only is defined in
   section 5.


4.  Allocation mechanism

   As part of VLAN auto-derive procedure, each PE can only need to
   configure the Leaf/Root properties for each AC.  Both the PWid FEC
   element and the Generalized PWid FEC Element can be used to set up
   the VPLS as defined in [RFC4762].  "MOD" operation is used to get
   Leaf/Root VLAN ID.  In some chips, one VLAN space will not support
   all VLANs from 0~4094, then in order to make automatic allocated

   Root/Leaf VLANs be within the VLAN space, so we define this
   opertation.
   o  Root ID = (ID) MOD (Maximum VLAN -Minimum VLAN)+Minimum VLAN + 1 +
      offset ;
   o  Leaf ID = (ID) MOD (Maximum VLAN -Minimum VLAN)+Minimum VLAN + 2 +
      offset

   For the PWid FEC element, PW type could be used as the ID, then every
   PE in all VPLS instances obtains one pair of VLANs indicate Root
   VLAN, Leaf VLAN respectively.

   For the Generalized PWid FEC, AGI/PW type is used as ID, and AGI is
   defined in [RFC5003].  AGI as a VPLS ID would be the same at a
   particular VPLS instance, and every PE uses the same "mod" operation
   to obtain Leaf/Root VLAN from the VPLS ID.  So every PE in the same
   VPLS instance obtains the same Root/Leaf VLAN.

   For the BGP-VPLS [RFC 4761], Import-RT+Export-RT could be used as ID.
   Import-RT+Export-RT would be same at a particular VPLS instance, and
   every PE uses the same "mod" operation to obtain Leaf/Root VLAN from
   the VPLS ID.  So every PE in the same VPLS instance obtains the same
   Root/Leaf VLAN.


5.   Extension to LDP-VPLS for E-tree support

   In addition to the signaling procedures for setting up PW as
   specified in RFC4447, one new PW interface parameter sub-TLV,the
   E-tree sub-TLV, is defined to use in E-Tree VPLS.

   The E-tree sub-TLV is defined as follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | E-tree (IANA) |    Length     |           Reserved          |P|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |          offset               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                 Figure 2

   In the above figure, reserved bit must be set to 0 when transmitting,
   and must be ignored upon receive.  P bit is used to flag the PE which
   is attached with only leaves as follows:

   o  P=1: the PE is attached with only leaves;
   o  P=0: the PE is attached with roots and leaves or is attached with
      only roots.

   For offset, it should be 16-bit.  It is configurable, if the operator
   uses different offset, it will lead some confusion.

   This TLV must be carried in label mapping message.  If a PE supports
   E-tree service, it must send this E-tree sub-TLV and include its
   local offset value.  A PE is attached with only leaves should set the
   P bit to 1.

   When a PE2 that received such a Label mapping message from its peer
   PE1, it knows that the PE1 has the E-tree capability.  PE2 should
   check if the local configure match the offset value that carried in
   the Label mapping message, and if PE1 is attached with only leaves.


6.  Extension to BGP-VPLS for E-tree support

   In addition to the signaling procedures for setting up PW as
   specified in [RFC4761], only a new extended community is defined to
   use in E-Tree VPLS.



                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                      |     Extended community type   |
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                      |          offset               |
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                      |   Reserved                  |P|
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                 Figure 3

   For offset, it should be 16-bit.  It is configurable, if the operator
   uses different offset, it will lead some confusion.

   P is a Leaf-only bit, it is set to 1 to indicate that the PE is
   attached with only leaves, and set to 0 otherwise.

   In figure 1, when a PE2 receives BGP UPDATE message with an E-Tree
   Extended Community from its peer PE1, it knows that the PE1 has the
   E-tree capability.PE2 should check if the local configure match the
   TPID value that carried in the E-Tree Extended Community, and if PE1
   is attached with only leaves.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new interface parameter sub-TLV types (E-tree
   sub-TLV) that is allocated by IANA, and a value of 0X18 is suggested
   for assignment with this sub-TLV.
