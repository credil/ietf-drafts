    <abstract>
      <t>In certain networks like financial information network (stock/commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications, Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet Loss is becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service providers. </t>
      <t><xref target="OSPF-TE-EXPRESS"/> and <xref target="ISIS-TE-EXPRESS"/> describes mechanisms with which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and ISIS respectively. The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. This document describes the extension to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as constraints for end to end path computation. </t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>Real time network performance is becoming a critical in the path computation in some networks. There exist mechanism described in <xref target="RFC6374"/> to measure latency, latency-variation and packet loss after the LSP has been established, which is inefficient. It is important that latency, latency-variation and packet loss are considered during path selection process, even before the LSP is set up.</t>
      <t>Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is populated with network performance information like link latency, latency variation and packet loss through <xref target="OSPF-TE-EXPRESS"/> or <xref target="ISIS-TE-EXPRESS"/>. Path Computation Client (PCC) can request Path Computation Element (PCE) to provide a path meeting end to end network performance criteria. This document extends Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/> to handle network performance constraint. </t>
      <t>PCE MAY use mechanism described in <xref target="MPLS-TE-EXPRESS-PATH"/> on how to use the link latency, latency variation and packet loss information for end to end path selection. </t>

    <section title="PCEP Requirements" toc="default">
      <t>End-to-end service optimization based on latency, latency-variation and packet loss is a key requirement for service provider. Following key requirements associated with latency, latency-variation and loss are identified for PCEP: 
</t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>PCE supporting this draft MUST have the capability to compute end-to-end path with latency, latency-variation and packet loss constraints. It MUST also support the combination of network performance constraint (latency, latency-variation, loss...) with existing constraints (cost, hop-limit...)</t>
          <t>PCC MUST be able to request for network performance constraint(s) in PCReq message as the key constraint to be optimized or to suggest boundary condition that should not be crossed. </t>
          <t>PCEs are not required to support service aware path computation. Therefore, it MUST be possible for a PCE to reject a PCReq message with a reason code that indicates no support for service-aware path computation.</t>
          <t>PCEP SHOULD provide a means to return end to end network performance information of the computed path in a PCRep message.</t>
          <t>PCEP SHOULD provide mechanism to compute multi-domain (e.g., Inter-AS, Inter-Area or Multi-Layer) service aware paths. </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>It is assumed that such constraints are only meaningful if used consistently: for instance, if the delay of a computed path segment is exchanged between two PCEs residing in different domains, consistent ways of defining the delay must be used.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="PCEP Extensions" toc="default">
      <t>This section defines PCEP extensions (see <xref target="RFC5440"/>) for requirements outlined in Section 3. The proposed solution is used to support network performance and service aware path computation. </t>
      <t> This document defines the following optional types for the METRIC object defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>. </t>
      <t>For explanation of these metrics, the following terminology is used and expanded along the way.</t>
      <t>- A network comprises of a set of N links {Li, (i=1...N)}.</t>
      <t>- A path P of a P2P LSP is a list of K links {Lpi,(i=1...K)}.</t>

        <t>- A Link delay metric of link L is denoted D(L).</t> 
	<t>- A P2P latency metric for the Path P = Sum {D(Lpi), (i=1...K)}. </t>
        <t>* T=13(IANA): Latency metric  </t>
        <t>PCC MAY use this latency metric in PCReq message to request a path meeting the end to end latency requirement. In this case B bit MUST be set to suggest a bound (a maximum) for the path latency metric that must not be exceeded for the PCC to consider the computed path as acceptable.  The path metric must be less than or equal to the value specified in the metric-value field. </t>
        <t>PCC MAY also use this metric to ask PCE to optimize latency during path computation, in this case B flag will be cleared. </t>
        <t>PCE MAY use this latency metric in PCRep message along with NO-PATH object in case PCE cannot compute a path meeting this constraint. PCE MAY also use this metric to reply the computed end to end latency metric to PCC. </t>

      </section>
      <section title="Mode of Operation" toc="default" >
        <t>As explained in <xref target="RFC5440"/>, the METRIC object is optional and can be used for several purposes. In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert one or more METRIC objects:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>To indicate the metric that MUST be optimized by the path computation algorithm (Latency, Latency-Variation or Loss)</t>
            <t>To indicate a bound on the path METRIC (Latency, Latency-Variation or Loss) that MUST NOT be exceeded for the path to be considered as acceptable by the PCC.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>In a PCRep message, the METRIC object MAY be inserted so as to provide the METRIC (Latency, Latency-Variation or Loss) for the computed path.  It MAY also be inserted within a PCRep with the NO-PATH object to indicate that the metric constraint could not be satisfied.</t>
        <t>The path computation algorithmic aspects used by the PCE to optimize a path with respect to a specific metric are outside the scope of this document.</t>
        <t>All the rules of processing METRIC object as explained in <xref target="RFC5440"/> are applicable to the new metric types as well. </t>
        <t>In a PCReq message, a PCC MAY insert more than one METRIC object to be optimized, in such a case PCE should find the path that is optimal when both the metrics are considered together.</t>
        <section title="Examples" toc="default">
          <t>Example 1: If a PCC sends a path computation request to a PCE where two metric to optimize are the latency and the packet loss, two METRIC objects are inserted in the PCReq message:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>First METRIC object with B=0, T=13 (TBA - IANA), C=1, metric-value=0x0000</t>
              <t>Second METRIC object with B=0, T=15 (TBA - IANA), C=1, metric-value=0x0000</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>PCE in such a case should try to optimize both the metrics and find a path with the minimum latency and packet loss, if a path can be found by the PCE and there is no policy that prevents the return of the computed metric, the PCE inserts first METRIC object with B=0, T=13 (TBA - IANA), metric-value= computed end to end latency and second METRIC object with B=1, T=15 (TBA - IANA), metric-value= computed end to end packet loss.</t>
          <t>Example 2: If a PCC sends a path computation request to a PCE where the metric to optimize is the latency and the packet loss must not exceed the value of M, two METRIC objects are inserted in the PCReq message:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>First METRIC object with B=0, T=13 (TBA - IANA), C=1, metric-value=0x0000</t>
              <t>Second METRIC object with B=1, T=15 (TBA - IANA), metric-value=M</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>If a path satisfying the set of constraints can be found by the PCE and there is no policy that prevents the return of the computed metric, the PCE inserts one METRIC object with B=0, T=13 (TBA - IANA), metric-value= computed end to end latency.  Additionally, the PCE may insert a second METRIC object with B=1, T=15 (TBA - IANA), metric-value= computed end to end packet loss.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC5623"/> provides a framework for PCE-Based inter-layer MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering. Lower-layer LSPs that are advertised as TE links into the higher-layer network form a Virtual Network Topology (VNT). The advertisement in higher-layer should include the network performance link properties based on the end to end metric of lower-layer LSP. Note that the new metric defined in this document are applied to end to end path computation, even though the path may cross multiple layers. </t>
