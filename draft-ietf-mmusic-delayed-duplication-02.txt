   Delayed Duplication Attribute in the Session Description Protocol
                draft-ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication-02

Abstract

   A straightforward approach to provide protection against packet
   losses due to network outages with a longest duration of T time units
   is to simply duplicate the original packets and send each copy
   separated in time by at least T time units.  This approach is
   commonly referred to as Time-shifted Redundancy, Temporal Redundancy
   or simply Delayed Duplication.  This document defines an attribute to
   indicate the presence of temporally redundant media streams and the
   duplication delay in the Session Description Protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Consider that a media sender transmits an original source packet and
   transmits its duplicate after a certain delay following the original
   transmission.  If a network outage hits the original transmission,
   the expectation is that the second transmission arrives at the
   receiver.  Alternatively, the second transmission may be hit by an
   outage and gets dropped, and the original transmission completes
   successfully.  On the receiver side, both transmissions can also
   arrive and in that case, the receiver (or the node that does the
   duplicate suppression) needs to identify the duplicate packets and
   discard them appropriately, producing a duplicate-free stream.

   Delayed duplication can be used in a variety of multimedia
   applications where there is sufficient bandwidth for the duplicated
   traffic and the application can tolerate the introduced delay.
   However, it must be used with care since it might easily result in a
   new series of denial-of-service attacks.  Furthermore, delayed
   duplication must not be used in cases where the primary cause of
   packet loss is congestion, rather than a network outage due to a
   temporary link or network element failure.  Duplication can make
   congestion only worse.

   One particular use case for delayed duplication is to improve the
   reliability of real-time video feeds inside a core IP network
   [IC2011].  Compared to other popular redundancy approaches such as

   Forward Error Correction (FEC) [RFC6363] and redundant data encoding
   (e.g., [RFC2198]), delayed duplication is quite easy to implement
   since it does not require any special type of encoding or decoding.

   For duplicate suppression, the receiver has to be able to identify
   the identical packets.  This is straightforward for media packets
   that carry one or more unique identifiers such as the sequence number
   field in RTP header [RFC3550].  In non-RTP applications, the receiver
   can use unique sequence numbers if available or other alternative
   approaches to compare the incoming packets and discard the duplicate
   ones.

   In this specification, we are not concerned about how the sender
   should determine the duplication delay.  We are not concerned about
   how the receiver can suppress the duplicate packets and merge the
   incoming streams to produce a hopefully loss-free and duplication-
   free output stream (a process commonly called stream merging),
   either.  These considerations are out of the scope for this
   specification.  Rather, our goal is to introduce a new attribute for
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] to indicate that a
   media stream is to be duplicated and transmitted two or more times,
   and also to indicate the relative delay for each additional
   duplication.

   In practice, more than two redundant streams are unlikely to be used
   since the additional delay and increased overhead are not easily
   justified.  However, we define the new attribute in a general way so
   that it could be used with more than two redundant streams (i.e.,
   multiple duplications), if needed.  While the primary focus in this
   specification is the RTP-based transport, the new attribute is
   applicable to both RTP and non-RTP streams.  Details on duplicating
   RTP streams are presented in [I-D.ietf-avtext-rtp-duplication].

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  The 'duplication-delay' Attribute

   The following ABNF [RFC5234] syntax formally describes the
   'duplication-delay' attribute:

   delaying-attribute     = "a=duplication-delay:" periods CRLF
   periods                = period *( SP period)
   period                 = 1*DIGIT ; in milliseconds

Internet-Draft    Delayed Duplication Attribute in SDP          May 2013


        Figure 1: ABNF syntax for the 'duplication-delay' attribute

   The 'duplication-delay' attribute is defined as both a media-level
   and session-level attribute.  It specifies the relative delay with
   respect to the previous stream for each duplication in milliseconds
   (ms) at the time of transmission.  The following rules apply:

   o  If used as a media-level attribute, it MUST be used with the
      'ssrc-group' attribute and "DUP" grouping semantics as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping].  When used as a media-
      level attribute, the relative delay value(s) it specifies SHALL
      apply to every Synchronization Source (SSRC)-based duplication
      grouping in the same media description.  In other words, one
      cannot specify different duplication delay values to different
      duplication groups in the same media description.

   o  If used as a session-level attribute, it MUST be used with 'group'
      attribute and "DUP" grouping semantics as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping].  When used as a session-
      level attribute, the relative delay value(s) it specifies SHALL
      apply to every duplication grouping in the same SDP description.
      In other words, one cannot specify different duplication delay
      values to different duplication groups in the same SDP
      description.  If one needs to specify different duplication delay
      values for different duplication groups, then one MUST use
      different SDP descriptions for each or MUST use the 'duplication-
      delay' attribute at media level.  In that case, the 'duplication-
      delay' attribute MUST NOT be used at the session level.

   o  For offer/answer model considerations, refer to
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping].

4.  SDP Examples

   In the first example below, the multicast stream consists of two RTP
   streams, each duplicated once, resulting in two sets of two-stream
   groups.  The same duplication delay of 100 ms is applied to each
   grouping.  The first set's streams have SSRCs of 1000 and 1010 and
   the second set's streams have SSRCs of 1020 and 1030.

        a=mid:Ch1



   Note that in actual use, SSRC values, which are random 32-bit
   numbers, could be much larger than the ones shown in this example.

   In the second example below, the multicast stream is duplicated
   twice.  50 ms after the original transmission, the first duplicate is
   transmitted and 100 ms after that, the second duplicate is
   transmitted.  In other words, the same packet is transmitted three
   times over a period of 150 ms.

        a=duplication-delay:50 100
        a=mid:Ch1



   In the third example below, the multicast UDP stream is duplicated
   with a duplication delay of 50 ms.  Redundant streams are sent in
   separate source-specific multicast (SSM) sessions so the receiving
   host has to join both SSM sessions if it wants to receive both
   streams.

5.  Security Considerations

   The 'duplication-delay' attribute is not believed to introduce any
   significant security risk to multimedia applications.  A malevolent
   third party could use this attribute to misguide the receiver(s)
   about the duplication delays and/or the number of redundant streams.
   For example, if the malevolent third party increases the value of the
   duplication delay, the receiver(s) will unnecessarily incur a longer
   delay since they will have to wait for the entire period.  Or, if the
   duplication delay is reduced by the malevolent third party, the
   receiver(s) might not wait long enough for the duplicated
   transmission and incur unnecessary packet losses.  However, these
   require intercepting and rewriting the packets carrying the SDP
   description; and if an interceptor can do that, many more attacks are
   also possible.

   In order to avoid attacks of this sort, the SDP description needs to
   be integrity protected and provided with source authentication.  This
   can, for example, be achieved on an end-to-end basis using S/MIME
   [RFC5652] [RFC5751] when SDP is used in a signaling packet using MIME
   types (application/sdp).  Alternatively, HTTPS [RFC2818] or the
   authentication method in the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974] could be used as well.

   Another security risk is due to possible software misconfiguration or
   a software bug where a large number of duplicates could be
   unwillingly signaled in the 'duplication-delay' attribute.
   Similarly, an attacker can use this attribute to start a denial-of-
   service attack by signaling and sending too many duplicated streams.
   In applications where this attribute is to be used, it is a good
   practice to put a hard limit both on the number of duplicate streams
   and the total delay introduced due to duplication regardless of what
   the SDP description specifies.
