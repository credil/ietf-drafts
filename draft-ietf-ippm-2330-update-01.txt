            Advanced Stream and Sampling Framework for IPPM
                     draft-ietf-ippm-2330-update-01

Abstract

   To obtain repeatable results in modern networks, test descriptions
   need an expanded stream parameter framework that also augments
   aspects specified as Type-P for test packets.  This memo proposes to
   update the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework with advanced
   considerations for measurement methodology and testing.  The existing
   framework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity, and that a
   single test stream will represent the characteristics of the path
   when it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and
   test stream descriptions must evolve with them, otherwise unexpected
   network features may dominate the measured performance.  This memo
   describes new stream parameters for both network characterization and
   support of application design using IPPM metrics.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group first created a
   framework for metric development in [RFC2330].  This framework has
   stood the test of time and enabled development of many fundamental
   metrics, while only being updated once in a specific area [RFC5835].

   The IPPM framework [RFC2330] generally relies on several assumptions,
   one of which is not explicitly stated but assumed: lightly loaded
   paths conform to the linear "delay = packet size / capacity"
   equation, being state/history-less (with some exceptions, firewalls
   are mentioned).  However, this does not hold true for many modern
   network technologies, such as reactive paths (those with demand-
   driven resource allocation) and links with time-slotted operation.
   Per-flow state can be observed on test packet streams, and such
   treatment will influence network characterization if it is not taken
   into account.  Flow history will also affect the performance of
   applications and be perceived by their users.

   Moreover, Sections 4 and 6.2 of [RFC2330] explicitly recommend
   repeatable measurement metrics and methodologies.  Measurements in
   today's access networks illustrate that methodological guidelines of
   [RFC2330] must be extended to capture the reactive nature of these
   networks.  Although the proposed extensions can support methodologies
   to fulfill the continuity requirement stated in section 6.2 of
   [RFC2330], there is no guarantee.  Practical measurements confirm
   that some link types exhibit distinct responses to repeated
   measurements with identical stimulus, i.e., identical traffic
   patterns.  If feasible, appropriate fine-tuning of measurement
   traffic patterns can improve measurement continuity and repeatability
   for these link types as shown in [IBD].

   We stress that this update of [RFC2330] does not invalidate or
   require changes to the analytic metric definitions prepared in the
   IPPM working group to date.  Rather, it adds considerations for
   active measurement methodologies and expands the importance of
   existing conventions and notions in [RFC2330], such as "packets of
   Type-P".

   Among the evolutionary networking changes is a phenomenon we call
   "reactive behavior", defined below.

1.1.  Definition: Reactive Path Behavior

   Reactive path behavior will be observable by the test packet stream
   as a repeatable phenomenon where packet transfer performance
   characteristics *change* according to prior observations of the
   packet flow of interest (at the reactive host or link).  Therefore,



Fabini & Morton          Expires April 18, 2014                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              Advanced Sampling               October 2013


   reactive path behavior is nominally deterministic with respect to the
   flow of interest.  Other flows or traffic load conditions may result
   in additional performance-affecting reactions, but these are external
   to the characteristics of the flow of interest.

   In practice, a sender may not have absolute control of the ingress
   packet stream characteristics at a reactive host or link, but this
   does not change the deterministic reactions present there.  If we
   measure a path and the arrival characteristics at the reactive host/
   link depend on both the sending characteristics and the transfer
   characteristics of intervening hosts and links, then the reaction
   will appear less deterministic owing to the noise in the pattern at
   the reactive host/link.

   Other than the size of the payload at the layer of interest and the
   header itself, packet content does not influence the measurement.
   Reactive behavior at the IP layer is not influenced by the TCP ports
   in use, for example.  Therefore, the indication of reactive behavior
   must include the layer at which measurements are instituted.

   Examples include links with Active/In-active state detectors, and
   hosts or links that revise their traffic serving and forwarding rates
   (up or down) based on packet arrival history.

   Although difficult to handle from a measurement point of view,
   reactive paths entities are usually designed to improve overall
   network performance and user experience, for example by making
   capacity available to an active user.  Reactive behavior may be an
   artifact of solutions to allocate scarce resources according to the
   demands of users, thus it is an important problem to solve for
   measurement and other disciplines, such as application design.


2.  Scope

   The scope of this memo is to describe useful stream parameters in
   addition to the information in Section 11.1 of [RFC2330] and
   described in [RFC3432] for periodic streams.  The purpose is to
   foster repeatable measurement results in modern networks by
   highlighting the key aspects of test streams and packets and make
   them part of the IPPM performance metric framework.


3.  New or Revised Stream Parameters

   There are several areas where measurement methodology definition and
   test result interpretation will benefit from an increased
   understanding of the stream characteristics and the (possibly



Fabini & Morton          Expires April 18, 2014                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              Advanced Sampling               October 2013


   unknown) network condition that influence the measured metrics.

   1.  Network treatment depends on the fullest extent on the "packet of
       Type-P" definition in [RFC2330], and has for some time.

       *  State is often maintained on the per-flow basis at various
          points in the path, where "flows" are determined by IP and
          other layers.  Significant treatment differences occur with
          the simplest of Type-P parameters: packet length.  Use of
          multiple lengths is RECOMMENDED.

       *  Payload content optimization (compression or format
          conversion) in intermediate segments.  This breaks the
          convention of payload correspondence when correlating
          measurements made at different points in a path.

   2.  Packet history (instantaneous or recent test rate or inactivity,
       also for non-test traffic) profoundly influences measured
       performance, in addition to all the Type-P parameters described
       in [RFC2330].

   3.  Access technology may change during testing.  A range of transfer
       capacities and access methods may be encountered during a test
       session.  When different interfaces are used, the host seeking
       access will be aware of the technology change which
       differentiates this form of path change from other changes in
       network state.  Section 14 of [RFC2330] treats the possibility
       that a host may have more than one attachment to the network, and
       also that assessment of the measurement path (route) is valid for
       some length of time (in Section 5 and Section 7 of [RFC2330]).
       Here we combine these two considerations under the assumption
       that changes may be more frequent and possibly have greater
       consequences on performance metrics.

   4.  Paths including links or nodes with time-slotted service
       opportunities represent several challenges to measurement (when
       service time period is appreciable):

       *  Random/unbiased sampling is not possible beyond one such link
          in the path.

       *  The above encourages a segmented approach to end to end
          measurement, as described in [RFC6049] for Network
          Characterization (as defined in [RFC6703]) to understand the
          full range of delay and delay variation on the path.
          Alternatively, if application performance estimation is the
          goal (also defined in [RFC6703]), then a stream with un-biased
          or known-bias properties [RFC3432] may be sufficient.

       *  Multi-modal delay variation makes central statistics
          unimportant, others must be used instead.

   Each of these topics is treated in detail below.

3.1.  Test Packet Type-P

   We recommend two Type-P parameters to be added to the factors which
   have impact on path performance measurements, namely packet length
   and payload type.  Carefully choosing these parameters can improve
   measurement methodologies in their continuity and repeatability when
   deployed in reactive paths.

3.1.1.  Multiple Test Packet Lengths

   Many instances of network characterization using IPPM metrics have
   relied on a single test packet length.  When testing to assess
   application performance or an aggregate of traffic, benchmarking
   methods have used a range of fixed lengths and frequently augmented
   fixed size tests with a mixture of sizes, or IMIX as described in
   [RFC6985].

   Test packet length influences delay measurements, in that the IPPM
   one-way delay metric [RFC2679] includes serialization time in its
   first-bit to last bit time stamping requirements.  However, different
   sizes can have a larger effect on link delay and link delay variation
   than serialization would explain alone.  This effect can be non-
   linear and change the instantaneous network performance when a
   different size is used, or the performance of packets following the
   size change.

   Repeatability is a main measurement methodology goal as stated in
   section 6.2 of [RFC2330].  To eliminate packet length as a potential
   measurement uncertainty factor, successive measurements must use
   identical traffic patterns.  In practice a combination of random
   payload and random start time can yield representative results as
   illustrated in [IRR].

3.1.2.  Test Packet Payload Content Optimization

   The aim for efficient network resource use has resulted in deployment
   of server-only or client-server lossless or lossy payload compression
   techniques on some links or paths.  These optimizers attempt to
   compress high-volume traffic in order to reduce network load.  Files
   are analyzed by application-layer parsers and parts (like comments)
   might be dropped.  Although typically acting on HTTP or JPEG files,
   compression might affect measurement packets, too.  In particular
   measurement packets are qualified for efficient compression when they



Fabini & Morton          Expires April 18, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              Advanced Sampling               October 2013


   use standard plain-text payload.

   IPPM-conforming measurements should add packet payload content as a
   Type-P parameter which can help to improve measurement determinism.
   Some packet payloads are more susceptible to compression than others,
   but optimizers in the measurement path can be out ruled by using
   incompressible packet payload.  This payload content could be either
   generated by a random device or by using part of a compressed file
   (e.g., a part of a ZIP compressed archive).

3.2.  Packet History

   Recent packet history and instantaneous data rate influence
   measurement results for reactive links supporting on-demand capacity
   allocation.  Measurement uncertainty may be reduced by knowledge of
   measurement packet history and total host load.  Additionally, small
   changes in history, e.g., because of lost packets along the path, can
   be the cause of large performance variations.

   For instance delay in reactive 3G networks like High Speed Packet
   Access (HSPA) depends to a large extent on the test traffic data
   rate.  The reactive resource allocation strategy in these networks
   affects the uplink direction in particular.  Small changes in data
   rate can be the reason of more than 200% increase in delay, depending
   on the specific packet size.

3.3.  Access Technology Change

   [RFC2330] discussed the scenario of multi-homed hosts.  If hosts
   become aware of access technology changes (e.g., because of IP
   address changes or lower layer information) and make this information
   available, measurement methodologies can use this information to
   improve measurement representativeness and relevance.

   However, today's various access network technologies can present the
   same physical interface to the host.  A host may or may not become
   aware when its access technology changes on such an interface.
   Measurements for paths which support on-demand capacity allocation
   are therefore challenging in that it is difficult to differentiate
   between access technology changes (e.g., because of mobility) and
   reactive path behavior (e.g., because of data rate change).

3.4.  Time-Slotted Randomness Cancellation

   Time-Slotted operation of path entities - interfaces, routers or
   links - in a network path is a particular challenge for measurements,
   especially if the time slot period is substantial.  The central
   observation as an extension to Poisson stream sampling in [RFC2330]



Fabini & Morton          Expires April 18, 2014                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              Advanced Sampling               October 2013


   is that the first such time-slotted component cancels unbiased
   measurement stream sampling.  In the worst case, time-slotted
   operation converts an unbiased, random measurement packet stream into
   a periodic packet stream.  Being heavily biased, these packets may
   interact with periodic behavior of subsequent time-slotted network
   entities[TSRC].

   Time-slotted randomness cancellation (TSRC) sources can be found in
   virtually any system, network component or path, their impact on
   measurements being a matter of the order of magnitude when compared
   to the metric under observation.  Examples of TSRC sources include
   but are not limited to system clock resolution, operating system
   ticks, time-slotted component or network operation, etc.  The amount
   of measurement bias is determined by the particular measurement
   stream, relative offset between allocated time-slots in subsequent
   path entities, delay variation in these paths, and other sources of
   variation.  Measurement results might change over time, depending on
   how accurately the sending host, receiving host, and time-slotted
   components in the measurement path are synchronized to each other and
   to global time.  If path segments maintain flow state, flow parameter
   change or flow re-allocations can cause substantial variation in
   measurement results.

   Practical measurements confirm that such interference limits delay
   measurement variation to a sub-set of theoretical value range.
   Measurement samples for such cases can aggregate on artificial
   limits, generating multi-modal distributions as demonstrated in
   [IRR].  In this context, the desirable measurement sample statistics
   differentiate between multi-modal delay distributions caused by
   reactive path behavior and the ones due to time-slotted interference.

   Measurement methodology selection for time-slotted paths depends to a
   large extent on the respective viewpoint.  End-to-end metrics can
   provide accurate measurement results for short-term sessions and low
   likelihood of flow state modifications.  Applications or services
   which aim at approximating path performance for a short time interval
   (in the order of minutes) and expect stable path conditions should
   therefore prefer end-to-end metrics.  Here stable path conditions
   refer to any kind of global knowledge concerning measurement path
   flow state and flow parameters.

   However, if long-term forecast of time-slotted path performance is
   the main measurement goal, a segmented approach relying on
   measurement of sub-path metrics is preferred.  Re-generating unbiased
   measurement traffic at any hop can help to reveal the true range of
   path performance for all path segments.

4.  Quality of Metrics and Methodologies

   [RFC6808] proposes repeatability and continuity as one of the metric
   and methodology properties to infer on measurement quality.
   Depending mainly on the set of controlled measurement parameters,
   measurements repeated for a specific network path using a specific
   methodology may or may not yield repeatable results.  Challenging
   measurement scenarios for adequate parameter control include
   wireless, reactive, or time-slotted networks as discussed earlier in
   this document.  This section presents an expanded definition of
   "repeatability" beyond the definition in [RFC2330] and an expanded
   examination of the [RFC2330] concept of "continuity" and its limited
   applicability.

4.1.  Repeatability

   [RFC2330] defines repeatability in a general way:

   "A methodology for a metric should have the property that it is
   repeatable: if the methodology is used multiple times under identical
   conditions, the same measurements should result in the same
   measurements."

   The challenge is to develop this definition further, such that it
   becomes an objective measurable criterion (and does not depend on the
   concept of continuity discussed below).  Fortunately, this topic has
   been treated in other IPPM work.  In BCP 176 [RFC6576], the criteria
   of equivalent results was agreed as the surrogate for
   interoperability when assessing metric RFCs for standards track
   advancement.  The criteria of equivalence were expressed as objective
   statistical requirements for comparison across same implementations
   and independent implementations in the test plans specific to each
   RFC evaluated ([RFC2679] in the test plan of [RFC6808]).

   The tests of [RFC6808] rely on nearly identical conditions to be
   present for analysis, but accept that these conditions cannot be
   exactly identical in the production network paths used.  The test
   plans allow some correction factors to be applied (some statistical
   tests are hyper-sensitive to differences in the mean of
   distributions), and recognize the original findings of [RFC2330]
   regarding excess sample sizes.

   One way to view the reliance on identical conditions is to view it as
   a challenge: how few parameters and path conditions need to be
   controlled and still produce repeatable methods/measurements?

   Although the [RFC6808] test plan documented numerical criteria for
   equivalence, we cannot specify the exact numerical criteria for



Fabini & Morton          Expires April 18, 2014                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              Advanced Sampling               October 2013


   repeatability *in general*.  The process in the BCP [RFC6576] and
   statistics in [RFC6808] have been used successfully, and the
   numerical criteria to declare a metric repeatable should be agreed by
   all interested parties prior to measurement.

   We revise the definition slightly, as follows:

   "A methodology for a metric should have the property that it is
   repeatable: if the methodology is used multiple times under identical
   conditions, the methods should produce equivalent measurement
   results."

4.2.  Continuity

   In the original framework [RFC2330], the concept of continuity was
   introduced to provide a relaxed criteria for judging repeatability,
   and was described in section 6.2 of [RFC2330] as follows:

   "...a methodology for a given metric exhibits continuity if, for
   small variations in conditions, it results in small variations in the
   resulting measurements."

   Although there are conditions where metrics may exhibit continuity,
   there are others where this criteria would fail for both user traffic
   and active measurement traffic.  Consider link fragmentation, and the
   non-linear increase in delay when we increase packet size just beyond
   the limit of a single fragment.  An active measurement packet would
   see the same delay increase when exceeding the fragment size.

   The Bulk Transfer Capacity (BTC) [RFC3148] gives another example at
   bottom of page 2:

   "There is also evidence that most TCP implementations exhibit non-
   linear performance over some portion of their operating region.  It
   is possible to construct simple simulation examples where incremental
   improvements to a path (such as raising the link data rate) results
   in lower overall TCP throughput (or BTC) [Mat98]."

   Clearly, the time-slotted network elements described in section 3.4
   above also qualifies as a new exception to the ideal of continuity.
   Therefore, we deprecate continuity as an alternate criterion on
   metrics, and prefer the more exact evaluation of repeatability
   instead.

4.3.  Actionable

   The IP Performance Metrics Framework [RFC2330] includes usefulness as
   a metric criterion:



Fabini & Morton          Expires April 18, 2014                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              Advanced Sampling               October 2013


   "...The metrics must be useful to users and providers in
   understanding the performance they experience or provide...".

   When considering measurements as part of a maintenance process,
   evaluation of measurement results for a path under observation can
   draw attention to potential performance problems "somewhere" on the
   path.  Anomaly detection is therefore an important phase and first
   step which already satisfies the usefulness criterion for many
   metrics.

   This concept of usefulness can be extended, becoming a sub-set of
   what we refer to as "actionable" criterion in the following.  Central
   to maintenance is the isolation of the root cause of reported
   anomalies down to a specific sub-path, link or host, and metrics
   should support this second step as well.  While detection of path
   anomaly may be the result of an on-going monitoring process, the
   second step of cause isolation consists of specific, directed on-
   demand measurements on components and sub-paths.  Metrics must
   support users in this directed search, becoming actionable:

   Metrics must enable users and operators to understand path
   performance and SHOULD help to direct corrective actions when
   warranted, based on the measurement results.

   Besides characterizing metrics, usefulness and actionable properties
   are also applicable to methodologies and measurements.

4.4.  Conservative

   [RFC2330] adopts the term "conservative" for measurement
   methodologies for which:

   "... the act of measurement does not modify, or only slightly
   modifies, the value of the performance metric the methodology
   attempts to measure."

   It should be noted that this definition of "conservative" in the
   sense of [RFC2330] depends to a large extent on the measurement
   path's technology and characteristics.  In particular, when deployed
   on reactive paths, sub-paths, links or hosts conforming to the
   definition in Section 1.1 of this document, measurement packets can
   originate capacity (re)allocations.  In addition, small measurement
   flow variations can result in other users on the same path perceiving
   significant variations in measurement results.

4.5.  Spatial and Temporal Composition

   Concepts related to temporal and spatial composition of metrics in
   Section 9 of [RFC2330] have been extended in [RFC5835].  [RFC5835]
   defines multiple new types of metrics, including Spatial Composition,
   Temporal Aggregation, and Spatial Aggregation.  So far, only the
   metrics for Spatial Composition have been standardized [RFC6049],
   providing the ability to estimate the performance of a complete path
   from subpath metrics.  Spatial Composition aligns with the finding of
   [TSRC], that unbiased sampling is not possible beyond the first time-
   slotted link within a measurement path.  In cases where measurement
   of subpaths is not feasible, restoring randomness of measurement
   samples when necessary is recommended as presented in [TSRC].

4.6.  Poisson Sampling

   Section 11.1.1 of [RFC2330] describes Poisson sampling, where the
   inter-packet send times have a Poisson distribution.  A path element
   with reactive behavior sensitive to flow inactivity could change
   state if the random inter-packet time is too long.  It is recommended
   to truncate the tail of Poisson distribution to avoid reactive
   element state changes.  Truncation has been used without issue to
   ensure that minimum sample sizes can be attained in a fixed test
   interval.


5.  Conclusions

   Safeguarding repeatability as a key property of measurement
   methodologies is highly challenging and sometimes impossible in
   reactive paths.  Measurements in paths with demand-driven allocation
   strategies must use a prototypical application packet stream to infer
   a specific application's performance.  Measurement repetition with
   unbiased network and flow states (e.g., by rebooting measurement
   hosts) can help to avoid interference with periodic network behavior,
   randomness being a mandatory feature for avoiding correlation with
   network timing.  Inferring the path performance between one
   measurement session or packet stream and other streams with alternate
   characteristics is generally discouraged with reactive paths because
   of the huge set of global parameters which have influence
   instantaneous path performance.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live paths are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and [RFC5357].
