Internet-Draft   RFC2544 Testing in Production Networks     October 2012


1.  Conventions used in the document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   This document considers the issues related to conducting tests
   similar to RFC2544 [RFC2544] in a prodcution network.


3.  Cautious of RFC2544 in Production Networks

   Some types of production network offer a high degree of assured
   issolation between the traffic of different users.  An example of a
   network technique that provides this issolation is a pseudowire
   [RFC3985].  Some types of network, known as transport networks
   [RFC5921] are traffic engineered to the point where there is normally
   no resource contention betwen user traffic.  The incautous use of
   unmodified RFC2544 testing is NOT RECOMMENDED [RFC2544].  However
   provided suitable approprate caution is applied the existing RFC2544
   tests may provide some useful information on the behaviour of such a
   network.

   When using unmodified RFC2544 tests on such a network the tester
   needs to be aware that the latency and latency variation will be
   significantly higher than in a laboratory environment, and that error
   rate and hence packet loss may be higher than in a laboratory
   environment.  It is therefore necessary to repeat tests a number of
   times to be confident of the results and to present the outcome in a
   statistical rather than definitive form.  It is also necessary to
   note that the results represent the behaviour of the system and
   network at the time of measurement and may not reperesent the
   behaviour at some other time in the past or in the future.

   Unmodified RFC2544 tests MUST NOT be conducted on a production
   network unless the tester is confident that the required degree of
   resource issolation is in place such that the tests will not be
   harmful to the network itself, other user traffic, or the performance
   applications using the network as a data path.


4.  Real World

   The following text does not seem useful as it is self evident and
   thus I propose to delete the section.

Internet-Draft   RFC2544 Testing in Production Networks     October 2012


   [2.  Real world

   In producing this document the authors attempted to keep in mind the
   requirement that apparatus to perform the described tests must
   actually be built.  We do not know of "off the shelf" equipment
   available to implement all of the tests but it is our opinion that
   such equipment can be constructed.]


5.  Test To Be Run

   The advice in [RFC2544] Section 3 regarding the applicability and
   usefulness of the tests applies to the situation considered in this
   document


6.  Evaluating the Results

   As noted in RFC2544 [RFC2544] Section 4 the test will produce a great
   deal of data, more so in the case when the tests are conducted on a
   production network, since it is advisable to repeat the tests to
   ensure that the results are statically representative of the
   behaviour of the devices and network path at the time of the test.
   In particular behavior such as latency variation or packet loss needs
   to be properly characterised.  Automation of the instumentation and
   improvements in display and visualization since RFC2544 was written
   should assist with this.

   As noted in RFC2544 the selection of the to be run and evaluation of
   the test data must therefore be done with an understanding of
   generally accepted testing practices regarding repeatability,
   variance, the tatistical significance of small numbers of trials and
   the nature of the production network.


7.  Requirements

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the MUST requirements for the protocols it implements.  An
   implementation that satisfies all the MUST and all the SHOULD
   requirements for its protocols is said to be "unconditionally
   compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST requirements but not all
   the SHOULD requirements for its protocols is said to be
   "conditionally compliant".

Internet-Draft   RFC2544 Testing in Production Networks     October 2012


8.  The Test Set Up

   There are two cases to be considered when setting up a test.  The
   first case is where the production network is providing an emulated
   physical or datalink serice such as a pseudowir, and this service is
   the subject of the test.  This is similar to the case shown in Figure
   2 of [RFC2544] , noting that either the service emulation will need
   to be put in loopback, or a second service will need to be provsioned
   to return the test traffic to the tester.

   The second case concerns where it is desired to determine the
   performance of a system that is handing off packets a packet
   equipment such as a Router (or a lable switched router (LSR)), such
   as when testing a virtual private network (VPN) service.  This is
   similar to the case shown in Figure 3 of RFC2544.

   In both cases it should be noted that measurements taken will be
   subject to imparement on both the outward path and the return path,
   and that it is not possible to easily determine the degree of
   imparement attributable to each path.  It will be the case that the
   path that is the subject of the test will, other than under
   pathalogical conditions, exhibit a performance that is at least as
   good as the measurements taken.


9.  DUT set up

   The advice in section 7 of [RFC2544] applies, with the exception that
   protocols and protocol modes not supported by the production network
   MUST NOT be configured or tested.  The protocol profile tested MUST
   be included or referenced in ant test report.


10.  Frame Formats

   The advice in Section 8 of [RFC2544]regarding Frame Formats applies.
   Given the evolution of network technology since 1999, some additional
   frame formats will be required, but these are out of scope for this
   document.


11.  Frame Sizes.

   The advice in Section 9 of [RFC2544] regarding frame size should be
   followed.

   Since the publication of RFC2544 the maximum packet size supported on
   Ethernet [anything else???] has increased with the introduction of



Bonica & Bryant          Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   RFC2544 Testing in Production Networks     October 2012


   jumbo frames.  The set of frame sizes tested SHOULD include the
   maxium size supported by the network.  The maximum size tested MUST
   be included in the test report.  This maximum size may be set by
   configuration, or may be determined by the tester automatically using
   a discovery technique.  Such a discovery technique should preferable
   be log n efficient such as a binary chop search.  The discovered
   maximum packet size should be verified a number of times (at least
   five times is RECOMMENDED) until a consistant result is achieved.


12.  Verifying received frames

   The advice in Section 10 of [RFC2544] SHOULD be followed regarding
   verification of frames


13.  Modifiers

   The advice in Section 10 of [RFC2544] SHOULD be followed regarding
   verification of frames

   [ We might want to update the following, although that really needs
   to be aligned with more modern advice on the lab version of this
   specification

   The rest of section 13 to be deleted

   It might be useful to know the DUT performance under a number of
   conditions; some of these conditions are noted below.  The reported
   results SHOULD include as many of these conditions as the test
   equipment is able to generate.  The suite of tests SHOULD be first
   run without any modifying conditions and then repeated under each of
   the conditions separately.  To preserve the ability to compare the
   results of these tests any frames that are required to generate the
   modifying conditions (management queries for example) will be
   included in the same data stream as the normal test frames in place
   of one of the test frames and not be supplied to the DUT on a
   separate network port.

   11.1 Broadcast frames

   In most router designs special processing is required when frames
   addressed to the hardware broadcast address are received.  In bridges
   (or in bridge mode on routers) these broadcast frames must be flooded
   to a number of ports.  The stream of test frames SHOULD be augmented
   with 1% frames addressed to the hardware broadcast address.  The
   frames sent to the broadcast address should be of a type that the
   router will not need to process.  The aim of this test is to



Bonica & Bryant          Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   RFC2544 Testing in Production Networks     October 2012


   determine if there is any effect on the forwarding rate of the other
   data in the stream.  The specific frames that should be used are
   included in the test frame format document.  The broadcast frames
   SHOULD be evenly distributed throughout the data stream, for example,
   every 100th frame.

   The same test SHOULD be performed on bridge-like DUTs but in this
   case the broadcast packets will be processed and flooded to all
   outputs.

   It is understood that a level of broadcast frames of 1% is much
   higher than many networks experience but, as in drug toxicity
   evaluations, the higher level is required to be able to gage the
   effect which would otherwise often fall within the normal variability
   of the system performance.  Due to design factors some test equipment
   will not be able to generate a level of alternate frames this low.
   In these cases the percentage SHOULD be as small as the equipment can
   provide and that the actual level be described in the report of the
   test results.

   11.2 Management frames

   Most data networks now make use of management protocols such as SNMP.
   In many environments there can be a number of management stations
   sending queries to the same DUT at the same time.

   The stream of test frames SHOULD be augmented with one management
   query as the first frame sent each second during the duration of the
   trial.  The result of the query must fit into one response frame.
   The response frame SHOULD be verified by the test equipment.  One
   example of the specific query frame that should be used is shown in
   Appendix C.

   11.3 Routing update frames

   The processing of dynamic routing protocol updates could have a
   significant impact on the ability of a router to forward data frames.
   The stream of test frames SHOULD be augmented with one routing update
   frame transmitted as the first frame transmitted during the trial.

   Routing update frames SHOULD be sent at the rate specified in
   Appendix C for the specific routing protocol being used in the test.
   Two routing update frames are defined in Appendix C for the TCP/IP
   over Ethernet example.  The routing frames are designed to change the
   routing to a number of networks that are not involved in the
   forwarding of the test data.  The first frame sets the routing table
   state to "A", the second one changes the state to "B".  The frames
   MUST be alternated during the trial.



Bonica & Bryant          Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   RFC2544 Testing in Production Networks     October 2012


   The test SHOULD verify that the routing update was processed by the
   DUT.

   11.4 Filters

   Filters are added to routers and bridges to selectively inhibit the
   forwarding of frames that would normally be forwarded.  This is
   usually done to implement security controls on the data that is
   accepted between one area and another.  Different products have
   different capabilities to implement filters.

   The DUT SHOULD be first configured to add one filter condition and
   the tests performed.  This filter SHOULD permit the forwarding of the
   test data stream.  In routers this filter SHOULD be of the form:

   forward input_protocol_address to output_protocol_address

   In bridges the filter SHOULD be of the form:

   forward destination_hardware_address

   The DUT SHOULD be then reconfigured to implement a total of 25
   filters.  The first 24 of these filters SHOULD be of the form:

   block input_protocol_address to output_protocol_address

   The 24 input and output protocol addresses SHOULD not be any that are
   represented in the test data stream.  The last filter SHOULD permit
   the forwarding of the test data stream.  By "first" and "last" we
   mean to ensure that in the second case, 25 conditions must be checked
   before the data frames will match the conditions that permit the
   forwarding of the frame.  Of course, if the DUT reorders the filters
   or does not use a linear scan of the filter rules the effect of the
   sequence in which the filters are input is properly lost.

   The exact filters configuration command lines used SHOULD be included
   with the report of the results.

   11.4.1 Filter Addresses

   Two sets of filter addresses are required, one for the single filter
   case and one for the 25 filter case.

   The single filter case should permit traffic from IP address
   198.18.1.2 to IP address 198.19.65.2 and deny all other traffic.

   The 25 filter case should follow the following sequence.

   deny aa.ba.1.1 to aa.ba.100.1 deny aa.ba.2.2 to aa.ba.101.2 deny
   aa.ba.3.3 to aa.ba.103.3 ... deny aa.ba.12.12 to aa.ba.112.12 allow

   aa.ba.14.14 to aa.ba.114.14 ... deny aa.ba.24.24 to aa.ba.124.24 deny
   all else

   All previous filter conditions should be cleared from the router
   before this sequence is entered.  The sequence is selected to test to
   see if the router sorts the filter conditions or accepts them in the
   order that they were entered.  Both of these procedures will result
   in a greater impact on performance than will some form of hash
   coding.]


14.  Protocol Addresses

   Where the test traffic is fully issolated from production traffic,
   for example when running over a PW, the advice in Section 12 of
   [RFC2544] MAY be followed.

   Where the test traffic shares the network with the production
   traffic, the addresses used MUST be those that are correctly routed
   to the designated test traffic receiver.  Correct routing of this
   traffic at a low data rate MUST be verified prior to running tests
   that subject the test receiver to a significant load.


15.  Route Set up

   Where the test traffic is fully issolated from production traffic,
   for example when running over a PW, the advice in Section 12 of
   [RFC2544] MAY be followed.

   Where the test traffic shares the network with production traffic,
   the existing routing protocols SHOULD be used to set up the routed
   path between the test traffic source and the test traffic
   destination.


16.  Bidirectional traffic

   The advice on traffic bidirectionality in Section 14 of [RFC2544]
   SHOULD be followed.


17.  Single Stream Path

   The advice on stream selection in Section 15 of [RFC2544] SHOULD be

Internet-Draft   RFC2544 Testing in Production Networks     October 2012


   followed.


18.  Multi-port

   The advice on exercising the ability of the DUT to concurrently
   receive packets for the same destination port giveb in Section 16 of
   [RFC2544] SHOULD be followed.


19.  Multiple Protocols

   The advice on multiple protocols given in Section 17 of [RFC2544]
   SHOULD be followed.


20.  Multiple frame sizes

   The advice on multiple frame sizes given in Section 18 of [RFC2544]
   SHOULD be followed.


21.  Testing performance beyond a single DUT.

   Section 19 of [RFC2544] discusses testing of multiple systems.  This
   is the normal case in a production network.  As noted in RFC2544 such
   tests require care in care in interpretation.  Unlike the laboratory
   benchmrk case however, the test will be exercising the network in the
   expected configuration, and thus is representive of the opertion of
   the system with the background traffic load of the time.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the test be repeated a number of times to guage the
   effect of variation of background traffic over both short and long
   term time frames.  The times of the test SHOULD be logged, and the
   results presented in such a way that the statistical nature of the
   test be clear to the reviewer.  It should be noted whether the type
   of production network was such that it would or not it would be
   anticipated that the test would be repeatable within the statistical
   significance of the measurements.


22.  Maximum frame rate

   The advice on maximum frame rate given in Section 20 of RFC2544
   [RFC2544] SHOULD be followed.

23.  Bursty Traffic

   The advice in Section 21 of [RFC2544] on bursty traffic SHOULD be
   followed.

   Editor's Note Do we need to recomemnd larger burst sizes?


24.  Rings

   [This is probably obselete now - suggest we delete the section

   Although it is possible to configure some token ring and FDDI
   interfaces to transmit more than one frame each time that the token
   is received, most of the network devices currently available transmit
   only one frame per token.  These tests SHOULD first be performed
   while transmitting only one frame per token.

   Some current high-performance workstation servers do transmit more
   than one frame per token on FDDI to maximize throughput.  Since this
   may be a common feature in future workstations and servers,
   interconnect devices with FDDI interfaces SHOULD be tested with 1, 4,
   8, and 16 frames per token.  The reported frame rate SHOULD be the
   average rate of frame transmission over the total trial period.]


25.  Trial description

   If the prodcution network is providing a layer 1 or layer 2 service,
   then the test may be conducted as described in Section 23 of
   [RFC2544].  If the production network is providing a layer 3 service
   care MUST be taken to ensure that any routes intruduced may be safely
   announced by the DUT without causing disruption to production
   traffic, and at such a volume that the route processors in the
   production network are not overloaded.


26.  Trial duration

   The advice in Section 24 of [RFC2544] on trial duration is
   applicable.


27.  Address resolution

   As stated in Section 25 of [RFC2544], the DUT SHOULD be able to
   respond to address resolution requests sent by the DUT wherever the
   protocol requires such a process.

28.  Benchmarking tests

28.1.  Throughput

   The throughput test described in Section 26.1 of [RFC2544]applies.
   However the reporting of a single number is NOT RECOMMENDED.  If a
   single is reported, it must be measured at a time during the busy
   period, and the value of the lower decile SHOULD be reported.

28.2.  Latency

   The latency testing described in Section 26.1 of [RFC2544] applies.
   Measurements SHOULD be carried out during the busy period.  The
   statistical averaging approach is for further study.

28.3.  Frame loss rate

   The frame loss proceedure described in Section 26.3 of [RFC2544] is
   modified as follows:

   The test should be repeated a number of times at each frame rate.
   The number of repeats SHOULD be configured by the tester and reported
   with the results.  The default value is 10 (pulled out of a hat).
   The exit criteria of loss free transmissions SHOULD be configured by
   the tester and reported with the results.  The default value is 10
   (also pulled out of a hat).

28.4.  Back-to-back frames

   The advice on back-to-back frames provided in Section 26.4 of
   [RFC2544] applies.

28.5.  System Recovery

   The advice on system recovery frames provided in Section 26.5 of
   [RFC2544] applies.

28.6.  Reset

   The advice provided in Section 26.6 of [RFC2544] on reset SHOULD be
   followed, except that the test MUST NOT be carried out on a DUT that
   is being used for production traffic unless a specific decision is
   made that disruption of the user traffic is acceptable.  This test
   MAY be carried out during the quiet period.

Appendix A.  Testing Considerations

   This Appendix will be deleted or updated in next version.  Text is a
   copy of Appendix A of [RFC2544]

   A.1 Scope Of This Appendix

   This appendix discusses certain issues in the benchmarking
   methodology where experience or judgment may play a role in the tests
   selected to be run or in the approach to constructing the test with a
   particular DUT.  As such, this appendix MUST not be read as an
   amendment to the methodology described in the body of this document
   but as a guide to testing practice.

   1.  Typical testing practice has been to enable all protocols to be
   tested and conduct all testing with no further configuration of
   protocols, even though a given set of trials may exercise only one

   protocol at a time.  This minimizes the opportunities to "tune" a DUT
   for a single protocol.

   2.  The least common denominator of the available filter functions
   should be used to ensure that there is a basis for comparison between
   vendors.  Because of product differences, those conducting and
   evaluating tests must make a judgment about this issue.

   3.  Architectural considerations may need to be considered.  For
   example, first perform the tests with the stream going between ports
   on the same interface card and the repeat the tests with the stream
   going into a port on one interface card and out of a port on a second
   interface card.  There will almost always be a best case and worst
   case configuration for a given DUT architecture.

   4.  Testing done using traffic streams consisting of mixed protocols
   has not shown much difference between testing with individual
   protocols.  That is, if protocol A testing and protocol B testing
   give two different performance results, mixed protocol testing
   appears to give a result which is the average of the two.

   5.  Wide Area Network (WAN) performance may be tested by setting up
   two identical devices connected by the appropriate short- haul
   versions of the WAN modems.  Performance is then measured between a
   LAN interface on one DUT to a LAN interface on the other DUT.

   The maximum frame rate to be used for LAN-WAN-LAN configurations is a
   judgment that can be based on known characteristics of the overall
   system including compression effects, fragmentation, and gross link
   speeds.  Practice suggests that the rate should be at least 110% of
   the slowest link speed.  Substantive issues of testing compression
   itself are beyond the scope of this document.]
