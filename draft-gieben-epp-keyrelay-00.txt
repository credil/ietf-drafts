       Key Relay Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol
                      draft-gieben-epp-keyrelay-00

Abstract

   This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
   extension mapping for the purpose of relaying DNSSEC key material
   from a one registrar to another.  The mapping introduces <keyrelay>
   as a new command in EPP.

   This command will help facilitating a transfer of a domain while
   keeping DNSSEC's chain of trust intact.

1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client, and
   "S:" represents lines returned by a protocol server.  "////" is used
   to note element values that have been shortened to better fit page
   boundaries.  Indentation and white space in examples is provided only
   to illustrate element relationships and is not a mandatory feature of
   this protocol.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   The term "key material" denotes one more DNSKEY resource records
   [RFC4034].

   In Section 1.2 of [I-D.koch-dnsop-dnssec-operator-change] the terms
   "losing DNS operator" and "gaining DNS operator" are defined.  With
   EPP a registry can only talk to its registrars, so in this document
   we will use the terms "loosing registrar" and "gaining registrar".

2.  Introduction

   Certain transactions for DNSSEC signed zones require an authenticated
   exchange of DNSSEC key material between DNS operators.  Often there
   is no direct secure channel or it is non-scalable.

Internet-Draft               EPP Key Relay                  January 2013


   One of such transactions is changing the DNS operator for DNSSEC
   signed zones ([I-D.koch-dnsop-dnssec-operator-change].  In this
   document we define a protocol extension for use in EPP that helps to
   implement and automate this transaction.  This protocol extension
   introduces a new command called "<keyrelay>".

3.  Relaying Key Material

   The "<keyrelay>" command uses the existing authenticated EPP channel
   with the registry.  Both registrars can securely talk to the registry
   and as such the registry can serve as a drop box for relaying key
   material between them (see Figure 1).

           +-------------------+  DNSKEY  +--------------------+
           |losing DNS operator| <~~~~~~~ |gaining DNS operator|
           +-------------------+          +--------------------+
                            ^              |
                            |              v
             +-----------------+          +-----------------+
             |current registrar|          |gaining registrar|
             +-----------------+          +-----------------+
                            ^              |
                   EPP poll |              | EPP keyrelay
                            |              V
                           +----------------+
                           |    registry    |
                           +----------------+

     The gaining and losing dns-operators should talk directly to each
     other (the ~ arrow) to exchange the DNSKEY, but often there is no
   trusted path between the two.  As both can securely interact with the
     registry through the registrar it can act as a relay for the key
                            material exchange.

                                Figure 1

   The "<keyrelay>" command uploads a new key to the registry.  This key
   material is then relayed to the current registrar's message queue.
   There is no need for the registry to store the relayed key in the
   registry system, although the registry MAY save the key for
   administrative purposes.

   The registrar may upload multiple keys in one "<keyrelay>" message.
   If keys are identical (Flags Field, Protocol Field, Algorithm Field
   and Public Key Field are equal), the duplicate keys MUST be dropped.

   There is no restriction on the type (for instance Key Signing Keys or
   Zone Signing Keys) of keys that can be put in the message.  It is up

   to the losing registrar to validate the correctness of the key
   material.

   If for some reason the registry can not process the "<keyrelay>"
   command an EPP error response MUST be returned.  If the registry does
   process the "<keyrelay>" command it MUST put all (discarding any
   duplicates) uploaded keys on to the losing registrars' message queue.

4.  Rational For a New Command

   The keyrelay command is different than the existing EPP commands,
   because it allows someone to manipulate data without actually being
   to owner of that data.  The EPP transfer command comes close with
   respect to this functionality.  We did not want to overload the
   transfer command for this purpose, because a keyrelay has nothing to
   do with that operation.

5.  Key Relay Interface

   The Key Relay Interface uses a "<keyrelay>" element for relay the key
   material.  It needs a maximum of three elements: a domain name, the
   key to upload and optionally a token which indicates a future
   transfer is imminent.

   The "<keyrelay>" element MUST contain the following child elements:

   o  A "<ext:name>" element that contains the domain name for which we
      upload the key.

   o  A "<ext:keyData>" element that contains the key material as
      described in [RFC5910], Section 4.2.

   And MAY contain:

   o  A "<ext:authInfo>" that contains an authorization token
      ([RFC5931], Section 3.2.4) This can be used as an extra indication
      that the losing and gaining registrar had prior contact and a
      possible, future transfer is authorized.

6.  Example Key Relay Interface

   The following is an example of the "<keyrelay>" command:

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in RFC 3688 [RFC3688].

   Two URI assignments must be completed by the IANA.

   Registration request for the extension namespace:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:keyrelay-1.0
   
   Registrant Contact: IESG
   
   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the extension XML schema:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:keyrelay-1.0
   
   Registrant Contact: IESG
   
   XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

12.  Security Considerations

   The "<keyrelay>" EPP extension does not allow for any object
   transformations.

   Any registrar can use this mechanism to put key material on the
   message queue of another registrar, thus mounting a denial of service
   attack.  However this can, and should be detected by the registry.
   The "<ext:authInfo>" element can be used as an indication that
   putting the key material on the losing registar's message queue is
   allowed.

   Communication between a registrar and registry is mostly done over
   EPP, but communication between dns-operators, registrants or
   registrars mostly is not.  If EPP is not used between these entities,
   relaying the key between a dns-operator and registrar should be
   adequately authenticated for the complete relay channel to remain
   secure.  It's out of scope for this document to describe how to
   authenticate other methods than EPP.
