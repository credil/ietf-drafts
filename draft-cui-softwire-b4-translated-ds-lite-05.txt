        Lightweight 4over6: An Extension to DS-Lite Architecture
              draft-cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite-05

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to DS-Lite called lightweight
   4over6.  This mechanism moves the translation function from the
   tunnel concentrator (AFTR) to initiators (B4s), and hence reduces the
   mapping scale on the concentrator to per-subscriber level.  To
   delegate the NAT function to the initiators, port-restricted IPv4
   addresses are allocated to the initiators.

1.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite technique (DS-Lite, [RFC6333]) provides IPv4 access
   over an IPv6 network relying on two functional elements: B4 and AFTR.
   The B4 element establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to an AFTR and
   encapsulates IPv4 packets in IPv6 packets.  When the AFTR receives
   theses IPv6 packets, it decapsulates them and then performs NAT44
   [RFC3022].  This procedure allows AFTR to dynamically assign port
   numbers to requesting users; hence, increases port-sharing ratio and
   utilization (see [RFC6269]).  There is a trade-off, though: the AFTR
   is required to maintain active NAT sessions.  In the centralized
   deployment model where one AFTR serves thousands of users, the large
   numbers of NAT sessions may become a performance bottleneck.  First,
   maintaining active NAT sessions requires AFTR constantly creating and
   purging NAT sessions.  Second, a large NAT table demands more
   processing power for searching and consumes more memory space.

   To address these issues, this document proposes an extension to DS-
   Lite technique.  The extension is designed to simplify the AFTR
   element by distributing NAT function among B4 elements.  The B4
   element is provisioned with an IPv6 address, an IPv4 address and a
   port-set.  The IPv6 address is used to create the Softwire, while the
   IPv4 address and port-set is used for NAT44 in the home gateway
   (CPE).  The CPE performs NAPT on end user's packets with the IPv4
   address and port-set.  IPv4 packets are forwarded between the CPE and
   the AFTR using IPv6 encapsulation.  The AFTR maintains a mapping
   entry with the CPE's IPv6 address, IPv4 address and port-set per
   subscriber.  For inbound IPv4 packets received on AFTR, it uses the
   IPv4 destination address and port to match the IPv6 encapsulation
   destination in the mapping table.  The AFTR does not maintain any NAT
   session entry.  Therefore, this extension removes the NAT module from
   the AFTR and significantly reduce the AFTR's mapping table size, and
   it also relaxes the requirement to create a log entry per active NAT
   session.  In fact, the mechanism is an extended case which covers
   addressing sharing for [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6].

   Compared to stateless solutions with port-set allocation such as
   MAP[I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port], this mechanism is
   suitable for operators who prefer to keep IPv6 and IPv4 addressing
   separated.  For example, an operator may want to provide IPv4 with an
   on-demand way in its IPv6 network when subscriber requested, the
   dynamic allocation of IPv4 address and port-set makes more efficient
   usage of IPv4 resource.  Another example is an operator may only have
   many small and discontinuous IPv4 blocks available to provide IPv4
   over IPv6, rather than few large IPv4 blocks.  This mechanism
   preserves the dynamic feature of IPv4/IPv6 address binding as in DS-
   Lite, so it won't require to administrate and manage many MAP domains
   in the network and mapping rules in the CPEs.

3.  Terminology

   The document defines the following terms:

   o  Lightweight 4over6: lightweight 4over6 is an IPv4-over-IPv6 hub
      and spoke mechanism, which supports address sharing [RFC6269] and
      performs the IPv4 translation (NAT44) on the initiator (spoke)
      side.

   o  Lightweight 4over6 initiator (or "initiator" for short): the
      tunnel initiator in lightweight 4over6 mechanism.  The lightweight
      4over6 initiator may be a host directly connected to an IPv6
      network, or a dual-stack CPE connecting an IPv4 local network to
      an IPv6 network.  It is collocated with a NAT44 function in
      addition to IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation and de-capsulation
      functions.

   o  Lightweight 4over6 concentrator (or "concentrator" for short): the
      tunnel concentrator in lightweight 4over6 mechanism.  The
      lightweight 4over6 concentrator tunnels IPv4 packets to the IPv4
      Internet over an IPv6 network.  It provides IPv4-in-IPv6
      encapsulation and decapsulation functions but not NAT function.

   o  Port-restricted IPv4 address: A public IPv4 address with
      restricted port-set.  In lightweight 4over6, multiple initiators
      may share the same IPv4 address, while the port-sets must be non-
      overlapping.  Source ports of IPv4 packets sent by the initiator
      must belong to the assigned port-set.

4.  Lightweight 4over6 Overview

   Lightweight 4over6 initiators and a lightweight 4over6 concentrator
   are connected through an IPv6-enabled network.  Both use IPv4-in-IPv6
   encapsulation scheme to deliver IPv4 connectivity services.  An
   initiator uses port-restricted IPv4 address for IPv4 services
   provisioned by the network.  This address may be provisioned via PCP,
   DHCPv4, DHCPv6, PPP IPCP, etc.(See Section 5 for further detail).
   The concentrator keeps the mapping between the initiator's IPv6
   address and the allocated IPv4 address + port-set.

5.  Port-Restricted IPv4 Address Allocation

   In lightweight 4over6, an initiator needs to be provisioned with the
   public address and port-set.  Different mechanisms can be used here
   for port-restricted IPv4 address provisioning, e.g., DHCPv4, DHCPv6,
   PCP, PPP IPCP, and even manual configuration.

   Below are listed examples of implementing the provisioning through
   the above mechanisms.  They are not mandatory requirements, and the
   specific protocol extensions is out of scope in this document.

   o  DHCPv4: the DHCPv4 protocol should be extended to support port-set
      allocation [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign].  Besides, the DHCP message
      should send to the concentrator over IPv6.  The concentrator can
      be the DHCP server or DHCP relay
      agent[I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6].

   o  PCP[I-D.ietf-pcp-base]: an initiator can launch multiple PCP
      requests simultaneously to acquire a number ports within the same
      IPv4 address, or use [I-D.tsou-pcp-natcoord] for one-time port-set
      allocation.

   o  DHCPv6: the DHCPv6 protocol should be extended to support port-set
      allocation [I-D.boucadair-dhcpv6-shared-address-option].

   o  IPCP: IPCP should be extended to carry the port-set.  [RFC6431]
      gives an example.

   When using dynamic provisioning mechanism such as DHCP or PCP, the
   initiator gets the IPv4 address and port-set allocated dynamically
   from the concentrator.  While provisioning the initiator, the
   concentrator records the dynamic mapping rule between the IPv4
   address, port-set and the IPv6 address simultaneously.  The port-
   restricted address allocation in lightweight 4over6 does not couple
   with IPv6 addressing.  Hence, there is no requirement for IPv4-IPv6
   mapping relationship such as IPv4 address encoding, IPv6 prefix
   length, multiplexing ratio, etc.

6.  Lightweight 4over6 Initiator Behavior

   A lightweight 4over6 initiator must discover the concentrator's IPv6
   address.  This IPv6 address can be learned through a variety of
   mechanisms, ranging from an out-of-band mechanism, manual
   configuration, DHCPv6, etc.  The mechanism is out of scope in this
   document.

   A lightweight 4over6 initiator should support dynamic port-restricted
   IPv4 address provisioning, by means of implementing the appropriate
   mechanism (e.g., DHCP, PCP, etc.).  The mechanism must be align
   between the initiator and the concentrator (i.e. the PCP Server,
   DHCPv4 server, etc.), which may be co-located with the concentrator.

   The data plane functions of the initiator include address translation
   (NAT44) and encapsulation/de-capsulation.  The initiator runs a
   standard NAT44 [RFC3022] using the allocated port-restricted address
   as external IP and port numbers.  Internal connected hosts source
   IPv4 packets with a [RFC1918] address.  When the initiator receives
   the IPv4 packet, it performs NAT44 function on the source address and
   port by using the public IPv4 address and a port number from the
   allocated port-set.  Then, it encapsulates the packet.  The
   destination IPv6 address is the concentrator's IPv6 address and the
   source IPv6 address is the initiator's IPv6 address.  Finally, the
   initiator forwards the encapsulated packet to the configured
   concentrator.  When the initiator receives an IPv4-in-IPv6 packet
   from the concentrator, it de-capsulates the IPv6 packet to retrieve
   the embedded IPv4 packet.  Then it performs NAT44 function and
   translates the destination address and port based on the available
   information in its local NAPT44 table.

   If the initiator is acting as a CPE, it is responsible for performing
   ALG functions (e.g., SIP, FTP), and other NAT traversal mechanisms
   (e.g., UPnP, NAT-PMP, manual mapping configuration, PCP) for the
   connected hosts.  This is the same requirement for typical NAT44
   gateways available today.

   If the initiator is collocated in the host, the host will be
   provisioned with the public IPv4 address and port-set directly.  Some
   applications relies on the socket API to allocate IPv4 source port,
   the API will randomly allocate an available port to the application.
   To ensure the port is from the provisioned port-set, the host should
   either implement a local NAT to map the randomly generated port by
   the API to the restricted port-set or modify the API to return a port
   from the restricted port-set.  Both options enable the host to source
   IPv4 packet using the restricted port-set without modifying the IPv4
   applications.

7.  Lightweight 4over6 Concentrator Behavior

   The lightweight 4over6 concentrator must create a table in which each
   entry contains a public IPv4 address, a port-set and an initiator's
   IPv6 address.  The concentrator MUST synchronize the port-restricted
   address provisioning process such as DHCP and PCP used by the
   Initiator.  This synchronization is deployment-specific (e.g., embed
   PCP Server, DHCP relay or Server, RADIUS, etc.)  When the IPv4
   address and port-set is successfully provisioned to the Initiator,
   the concentrator simultaneously creates a map entry in its table.
   This entry contains the public IPv4 address, the port-set and the
   initiator's IPv6 address.  The lifetime is determined by the
   provisioning mechanism.  The IPv6 address in the map entry is used as
   the index for encapsulating inbound packets.  This map entry will be
   deleted when the lifetime expires.  The lifetime of the map entry
   should be refreshed when the initiator renews/extends the allocation.

   The data plane functions of the concentrator are encapsulation and
   de-capsulation.  When the concentrator receives an IPv4-in-IPv6
   packet from an initiator, it de-capsulates the IPv6 header and
   verifies the source port and address in the table.  If the source
   port and address matches the Initiator's IPv6 address in the table,
   the concentrator forwards the packet to the IPv4 destination.  If
   not, the concentrator must discard the packet.

   When the concentrator receives an IPv4 packet from the Internet, it
   uses the destination address and port to lookup the destination
   initiator's IPv6 address in the table.  If a match is found, the
   concentrator encapsulates the IPv4 Packet.  The source is the
   concentrator's IPv6 address and the destination is the initiator's
   IPv6 address.  Then, the concentrator forwards the packet to the
   initiator natively over the IPv6 network.  When no match is found,
   the concentrator must discard the packet.

10.  ICMP processing

   ICMP does not work through NAT44 [RFC6269]).  When implementing
   lightweight 4over6, ICMP Identifier MUST be treated as port number
   for UDP/TCP.  Therefore, when the initiator generates an ICMP packet,
   it MUST use an available port from its port-set as the ICMP
   identifier.  When the concentrator receives an ICMP reply packet from
   the IPv4 network, it must use the identifier as the port number and
   search its table.  If a match is found, it must forward the ICMP
   reply packet to the initiator stored in the entry.  The lookup
   process is identical to normal TCP/UDP lookup.  For inbound ICMP
   request packet, the concentrator may be configured in two modes:

   o  Forward the request to the appropriate initiator using the
      Identifier field when a mapping entry is found; if not the ICMP
      request is silently dropped.

   o  Discard all inbound ICMP requests.

   The ICMP policy is determined by service providers.

11.  Mechanism Analysis

   Compared with original DS-Lite, lightweight 4over6 move the
   translation function from the concentrator and distribute it to
   initiators.  This reduces states on the concentrator from per-session
   level down to per-subscriber level.  This potentially reduces the
   concentrator complexity to manage a relatively large NAT table.  In
   theory, the concentrator should scale better and serve more
   subscribers on the same hardware platform.

   The initiator is provisioned with a public IPv4 address and port-set,
   and translation is performed only once, so it is a single NAT
   architecture.

   When the initiator acts as a CPE, it is required to implement ALG and
   NAT referral problem.  These problems are solved today by combination
   of UPnP, NAT-PmP, etc.  Many existing CPEs have already implemented
   these functionalities.  So lightweight 4over6 initiator can leverage
   these existing mechanisms to address the same problems.

   When the AFTR performs per-session log, the volume could increase
   rapidly because each new session may create a new log entry.  Some
   optimization has been discussed to reduce log volume
   [I-D.donley-behave-deterministic-cgn].  When the concentrator
   performs per-subscriber tunnel log, each subscriber creates only one
   log.  This is identical to logging subscriber by IPv4 address.  This
   mechanism is widely used today.  Service providers can re-use the
   same mechanism with minor modification.

   Lightweight 4over6 does not couple port-restricted address and the
   IPv6 addressing.  No specific IPv6 address format is required.  IPv4
   and IPv6 addressing and routing remain separated.  The service
   provider can provide IPv4 in a flexible, on-demand way, as well as
   manage the native IPv6 network without the influence of IPv4-over-
   IPv6 requirements.  This would ease to achieve future adjustment of
   IPv4 address pool.

   The trade-offs of lightweight 4over6 are possibility of lower IPv4
   address utilization ratio and extra signaling behavior for
   provisioning.  When compared to stateless solutions, lightweight
   4over6 still keeps subscriber-level states rather than becoming
   purely stateless.

12.  Security Consideration

   As the port space for a subscriber shrinks significantly due to the
   address sharing, the randomness for the port numbers of the
   subscriber is decreased significantly.  In other words, it is more
   easier for an attacker to guess the port number used, which results
   in attacks ranging from throughput reduction to broken connections or
   data corruption.  Here the port-set for a subscriber can be a bulk of
   contiguous ports or non-contiguous ports.  Contiguous port-set can't
   help the situation, while with non-contiguous port-set (which may be
   generated in a pseudo-random way [RFC6431]), the randomness of the
   port number is improved, provided that the attacker is outside the
   lightweight 4over6 domain and hence doesn't know the port-set
   generation algorithm.

   More considerations of IP address sharing discussed in Section 13 of
   [RFC6269] are applicable to this solution.
