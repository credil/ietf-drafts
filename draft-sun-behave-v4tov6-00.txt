      The Approach for IPv4-only users to access IPv6-only Content
                       draft-sun-behave-v4tov6-00

Abstract

   Current approaches can not solve the scenario that the users from
   IPv4 Internet to access IPv6-only content.  When IPv6 content are
   becoming more and more popular, it is important to ensure that IPv6-
   only content can be reachable from legacy IPv4-only clients via some
   IPv4-only network.  This document proposes two approaches for IPv4-
   only users to access IPv6-only content.  It is designed to cover the
   Scenario 2 in [RFC6144].

Internet-Draft      IPv4 user to access IPv6 Content           July 2013


1.  Introduction

   In [RFC6144], Scenario 2 is an important use case.  Not only could
   servers move directly to IPv6 without trudging through a difficult
   transition period, but they could do so without risk of losing
   connectivity with the IPv4-only Internet.

   Existing solutions have not solved this scenario well.  NAT-
   PT[RFC2766]can be used in this scenario, but it requires a tightly
   coupled DNS Application Level Gateway (ALG) in the translator, and
   have been deprecated by the IETF [RFC4966].  The stateless
   translation solution [RFC6219] can work too, but since each IPv6
   server will consume one IPv4 public address, it is not suitable to
   deploy in situation that operators are running out of IPv4 address.
   [RFC6156] can be used for IPv4 client to communicate with IPv6
   client.  But this requires the IPv4 client and IPv6 client to
   implement a TURN client.  Therefore, it is not suitable for
   C-S(Client-Server) and B-S (Browser-Server) mode.

   [I-D.rfvlb-behave-v6-content-for-v4-clients] can work for IPv4-only
   user to access IPv6 content.  But since it uses private IPv4 address
   to mapping the IPv6 server, it can only be used for IPv4 network to
   reach IPv6 network.

   This document is designed for IPv4 Internet to reach IPv6 network.
   There are several requirements in this design:

      1.Considering IPv4 address has been a scarce resource, the amount
      of public IPv4 addresses consumed by the translator should be less
      than that the number of IPv6 servers in the IPv6 network.

      2.  It should not require extra modifications on the server, e.g.
      by using a dynamic port number, implementing TURN client, etc.

   In this document, we propose two approaches for this scenario.  The
   first one requires modification on the DNS server, but introduces no
   application-layer functionality.  The second one can use the current
   DNS infrastructure, but would require to implement a redirect server.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terminology defined in [RFC6144] is used extensively in this
   document.  Besides, this document uses the following terminologies:

   IPv6-converted addresses: IPv4 addresses used to represent IPv6 nodes
   in an IPv4 Internet.  They have an explicit mapping relationship to
   IPv6 addresses.

   NAT46: a stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation functionality.  It is
   consistent with IP/ICMP translation [RFC6145], and can also support
   IPv6-converted address selection and binding table maintenance.


3.  The NAT46 translator for IPv4 Internet to access IPv6 network

   The NAT46 solution is used for IPv4 clients in IPv4 Internet to reach
   IPv6 servers (depicted in Figure 1).

       Figure 1: Overall solution for IPv4 Internet to IPv6 network

   In order to achieve the translation initiated from IPv4 side, two
   addresses need to be determined by NAT46 translator.  The first one
   is the IPv6-converted address of the IPv6 server, which is is
   selected from the IPv4 address pool configured in NAT46.  The second
   one is the IPv4-converted address for the IPv4 client, which can be
   synthetized using the stateless approach defined in [RFC6052].

   In our approach, since no extra modifications (e.g. changing the port
   number, etc. ) can be taken to existing sever , only source address
   and destination address can be used as an index in the mapping table.
   Therefore, the mapping table includes client's IPv4 address, server's

   IPv6-converted address, client's IPv4-converted address, server's
   IPv6 address and the lifetime (as depicted in Figure1).  For upstream
   traffic from the IPv4 client, the source address and destination
   address is the client's IPv4 address and the server's IPv6-converted
   address, while for downstream traffic of the IPv6 server, the source
   address and destination address is the Server's IPv6 address and the
   client's IPv4-converted address respectively.

3.1.  IPv6-converted Address Selection

   To achieve translation from IPv4 Internet to IPv6 network, the
   client's IPv4 address and server's IPv6 address has been known in
   advance.  Therefore, the key point is to determine the IPv6-converted
   address for the IPv6 server.

   Considering IPv4 address has been a scarce resource, the following
   rule is defined to select IPv6-converted address from the IPv4
   address pool:

      If NAT46 has already created a mapping entry for the IPv4 client,
      a new IPv6-converted address for which the client is not being
      used in the current mapping table MUST be selected from the IPv4
      address pool.  In other words, different servers can share one
      IPv6-converted address by different clients.

      If there is still no mapping for a certain IPv4 client in the
      mapping-table, a previous used IPv4 address can be selected for
      this client.

   Example: if there have been two mapping entries in the mapping table.

+----------+-----------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
|   No.    |   Client  | IPv6-converted | IPv4-converted    |  Server   |
|          | IPv4 Addr |    Address     |    Address        | IPv6 Addr |
+----------+-----------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
|   1      |23.0.0.1   | 210.0.0.1      |2001:c68::23.0.0.1 |2001:c61::1|
+----------+-----------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
|   2      |23.0.0.2   | 210.0.0.2      |2001:c68::23.0.0.2 |2001:c61::2|
+----------+-----------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+

                    Figure 2: Example of Existing Table

   Then user3 arrives with the source address 23.0.0.3, the IPv6-
   converted address can reuse an existing IPv6-converted address in the
   mapping table, e.g. 210.0.0.2.  However, if user2 arrives again with
   the same source address 23.0.0.2 to visit a new IPv6 server, a
   different IPv6-converted address other than 210.0.0.2 in the above
   example has to be selected from the address pool (e.g. 210.0.0.1 or

Internet-Draft      IPv4 user to access IPv6 Content           July 2013


   210.0.0.3, etc).

   With this rule, the number of public IPv4 addresses consumed by the
   translator equals to the number of the destination addressses that
   one client is connecting at the same time (or within a certain
   period).  Since the number of destination addresses consumed by one
   client in a short time is usually limited, this can greatly reduce
   the number of public IPv4 addresses that needs to be configured in
   the address pool.

   Besides, since each mapping entry has a lifetime, one can further
   control the amount of consumed address by adjusting the mapping
   lifetime.  See more detailed discussion on dynamic IPv6-converted
   address issue in section 7.


4.  Approach 1: DNS46-based solution

   This approach is designed for situation when DNS46 functionality is
   able to deploy in the network.  It is independent of translated
   protocol.  For applications without DNS process can not be solved by
   this approach.  The overall solution is depicted in Figure 3.

   It consists of several functionalities:

   1.NAT46: This functionality achieves the translation between IPv4
   packet and IPv6 packet.  It is consistent with [RFC6145].  Besides,
   it should also support IPv6-converted address selection (as defined
   in section 4.)

   2.DNS46: A DNS translator that translates AAAA record to A record.
   It should also have an interface with NAT46 to retrieve IPv6-
   converted on demand.

   The workflow of this apporach is as follows:

                Figure 4: Workflow of DNS46-based approach

   1.  An IPv4 client initiates a DNS query for A record (e.g.
   ipv6.example.com).

   2.  DNS46 receives the query.  If there is no existing A record, it
   initiates an AAAA query for ipv6.example.com.

   3.  On receiving the IPv6 address for this domain name, it initiates
   a request to get IPv6-converted address from NAT46.  The sepecific
   protocol for the request is out of scope.

   4.  NAT46 selects IPv6-converted address from its IPv4 address pool
   using IPv6-converted address selection mechanism (see section 3.1).
   It creates the mapping table to be used in subsequent IPv4 traffic
   translation.

   5.  NAT46 returns the IPv6-converted address to DNS46 and DNS46 in
   turn returns A record to the IPv4 client.

   6.  IPv4 client sends IPv4 traffic with the returned IPv6-converted
   address as the destination address.  The traffic will be routed to
   NAT46, and NAT46 translates the IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet according
   to [RFC6145].

   able to be upgraded to support DNS46 functionality.  This approach
   can only be used for HTTP-based application.  The overall solution is

   a different IPv6-converted address.

   The workflow of this apporach is as follows:

                 Figure 6: Workflow of Proxy-lite Approach

   1.  An IPv4 client initiates a DNS query for A record (e.g.
   ipv6.example.com).

   2.  In DNS server, the address of the redirect server is configured
   as the A record for ipv6.example.com and returns to the IPv4 client.

   3.  The IPv4 client sends HTTP GET request.  The domain name (e.g.
   ipv6.example.com) is carried in HOST field.

   4.  The redirect server interprets the domain name, and sends the
   request to get IPv6-converted address to NAT46 (carrying the address
   of IPv4 client).  The specific protocol for the request is now out of
   scope.

   5.  NAT46 selects IPv6-converted address from its IPv4 address pool
   using IPv6-converted address selection mechanism (see section 3.1).
   It creates the mapping table to be used in subsequent IPv4 traffic
   translation.

   6.  NAT46 returns the IPv6-converted address to redirect server and
   the redirect server in turn returns IPv6-converted address in HTTP

   redirect packet with HTTP error "302 not found".

   7.  IPv4 client replaces the destination IPv4 address with the
   returned IPv6-converted address.  The IPv4 traffic is routed to the
   NAT46 and the NAT46 translates the IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet
   according to [RFC6145].


6.  The Dynamic IPv6-converted Address Issue

   The major feature in the above two approaches is that the IPv6-
   converted address for destination IPv6 server is now dynamically
   determined by NAT46.  In this way, IPv4 address sharing can been
   achieved, however, it will also bring some issues.  In this section,
   some issues raised by the dynamic IPv6-converted address are analyzed
   and some guidelines for implemention are proposed.

6.1.  DNS cache problem

   In practice, DNS cache is widely used in local DNS server and end-
   host's operating system.  This might cause problem when the mapping
   entry has expired in NAT46 but the records still exist in DNS cache
   or end-host.  For example, when a user has finished visiting a
   website (v61.example.com) and the lifetime of the mapping entry has
   expired.  Then the same user re-opens the same website later.  He
   might not initiate further DNS requests if the operating system still
   stores the previous A record which is no long effective anymore.

   Possible solution:

   This problem can be solved by carrying the DNS TTL value equals to
   the lifetime of the mapping entry in the NAT46.  DNS46 SHOULD also
   return the TTL value to the user so that the operating system will
   not cache the DNS record when DNS TTL has expired.

6.2.  Mapping entry's lifetime problem before session finished

   In NAT46, each mapping entry has a corresponding lifetime, which
   means this mapping will be deleted after the lifetime has expired.
   However, when there is no DNS requests for subsequent traffic, the
   mapping can not been created dynamically without knowing the
   destination IPv6 address for each session.  Therefore, unfinished
   sessions can not be translated successfully.

   Possible solution:

   To solve this problem, the status of the mapping entry can be further
   introduced, including active and inactive.  If there is traffic for

   this mapping within a certain period, the mapping's status should
   keep in active and the lifetime of the mapping entry should be
   prolonged before it expires.  Only inactive mapping entries for which
   there is no traffic in a certain period can be deleted when the
   lifetime expires.

6.3.  Address Reusability Problem

   In NAT46, the IPv4 address can be released when the mapping has been
   deleted.  But if a user has finished surfing a website (which means
   the mapping has been deleted in NAT46) and turns to a new website,
   but does not close the previous webpage, the released IPv4 address
   might be assigned to the new website in NAT46.  When the user turns
   back to the previous webpage again after a long time, there might be
   no DNS requests as the application thought it has ready got the
   destination address before.  But this time, this address will lead to
   a new site.

   Possible solutions:

   The problem can be alleviated if NAT46 will select a new IPv4 address
   rather than a newly released one for the same user.  But it will
   still happen eventually when the address pool has been exhausted.

   In reality, this problem is not severe since the user will not get
   the correct content with a wrong request.  For example, in HTTP GET
   request, a wrong server will not response correctly if it does not
   have the content as the client is asking for.  On receiving an error
   report, the user can would refresh the website manually and so the
   DNS process will be re-initiated.  Actually, in current situation, a
   user will normally refresh a website that has not been visited for a
   long time.

   No requirement on IANA.
