                      PCP Unsupported Family Error
                  draft-cheshire-pcp-unsupp-family-00

Abstract

   The Port Control Protocol allows clients to request mappings in NAT
   gateways and firewalls.  The PCP UNSUPP_FAMILY error code enables PCP
   servers to inform clients when the requested external address family
   is not supported.

Internet-Draft              PCP UNSUPP_FAMILY                   May 2013


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The Port Control Protocol [RFC6887] allows clients to request
   mappings in NAT gateways and firewalls.  A client can request a
   mapping to an external IPv4 address or to an external IPv6 address.
   The client signifies which family of external address it desires by
   the type of address it puts into the Suggested External Address
   field.

   If the client wants an external IPv4 address, then it populates the
   Suggested External Address field with an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   (the first 80 bits set to zero, the next 16 set to one).  This
   includes the case of the all-zeros IPv4 address (::ffff:0:0).

   If the client wants an external IPv6 address, then it populates the
   Suggested External Address field with a native IPv6 address.  This
   includes the case of the all-zeros IPv6 address (::).

   However, some devices may not be able to provide the requested
   external address family.  For example, an IPv4-only NAT cannot
   provide an external IPv6 address.

   In the event that the device cannot provide the requested external
   address family, it MUST return a PCP error reply containing the
   UNSUPP_FAMILY error code.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should allocate the following PCP Result Code:

   14 UNSUPP_FAMILY: Unsupported external address family, e.g., IPv6 in
      a NAT that handles only IPv4.  This is a long lifetime error.


4.  Security Considerations

   This new error code leaks no sensitive information and creates no new
   security vulnerabilities.
