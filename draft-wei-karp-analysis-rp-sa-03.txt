1.  Introduction

   The karp (Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols) working
   group aims to secure the packets on the wire of the routing protocol
   exchanges.  This work has been divided into two phases, (1) Enhance
   the routing protocol's current authentication mechanism; (2) Develop
   an automated keying framework [ietf-karp-design-guide].  Currently,
   there are a variety of routing protocols.  Many routing protocols (or
   groups of protocols) have already defined security association (SA)
   for cryptographic message authentication and integrity protection,
   which are listed in the appendix.  SA is the basis for protecting the
   packet of routing protocol; it may also affect the design of key
   management protocol (KMP) and framework of the karp.  As a start, it
   is desirable to analyze existing security associations of routing
   protocols.

   The main idea of this document is as follows:

   1.  Briefly overview of existing SA of routing protocols.

   2.  Compare those typical fields in routing protocol SA one by one,
   and identify potential issues.

   3.  Discuss the possible methods for that problem.

2.  Analysis of security associations for current routing protocols

   This section considers the security associations of the following
   routing protocols: RIPv2, OSPFv2, ISIS, BFD, OSPFv3, PCE, LDP, LMP,
   MSDP, RSVP-TE, PIM, and BGP.

   Among the above routing protocols, BGP [RFC5925], PCE [RFC5440], LDP
   [RFC5036], and MSDP [RFC3618], use TCP-AO as protection, hence lack
   the definition of SA as other routing protocols especially those
   using IPsec as protection.  We may consider the attributes of TCP-AO
   as parameters of SA for those routing protocols listed in this
   paragraph.

2.1.  Summary for security associations of current routing protocols

   The security associations of current routing protocols are summarized
   as follows:

   o The RIPv2 SA [RFC4822] includes the following information: key
   identifier, cryptographic algorithms, key length, sequence number,
   and life time of SA.

   o The OSPFv2 SA [RFC5709] includes the following information: key
   identifier, cryptographic algorithms, key length, and life time of
   SA.

   o The ISIS SA [RFC5310] includes the following information: key
   identifier, cryptographic algorithms, key length.

   o The BFD SA [draft-bhatia-bfd-crypto-auth] includes the following
   information: key identifier, cryptographic algorithms, key.

   o The RSVP-TE SA [RFC2747] includes the following information: key
   identifier, cryptographic algorithms, algorithm mode, key, life time
   of the key, sequence number.

   o The BGP, PCE, LDP, MSDP SA includes the following
   information[RFC5925]: key identifier, cryptographic algorithms,
   master key, key derivation function (KDF), sequence number, etc.

   o The OSPFv3, LMP, PIM, RSVP-TE (when using IPsec as its security
   protocol) SA includes the following information[RFC4301]: Security
   Parameter Index, Sequence Number Counter, Sequence Counter Overflow,
   Anti-Replay Window, AH Authentication algorithm and key, ESP
   Encryption algorithm and key and mode, ESP integrity algorithm and
   keys, ESP combined mode algorithms and key, Lifetime, IPsec protocol
   mode, Stateful fragment checking flag, Bypass DF bit, DSCP values,
   Bypass DSCP, Path MTU, Tunnel header IP source and destination
   address.

   The details of these SAs are listed in the appendix.

2.2.  Analysis of security associations of current routing protocols

   The fields in the above security associations are analyzed as
   follows:

   o Key identifier: Key identifier (Key ID) is used to uniquely
   identify a SA.  All SAs used in routing protocols specify this field
   as listed in table 1.

                Table 1 Key Identifier Field of SAs
   +--------------/-----------------/------------------+
   | SA of Routing|  Name of Key ID | Length of Key ID |
   | Protocol     |                 |                  |
   ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
   | RIPv2        |  Key Identifier | 8 bits           |
   ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
   | OSPFv2       |  Key Identifier | 8 bits           |
   ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
   | ISIS         |  Key Identifier | 2 octets         |
   ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
   | BFD          |  Authentication | 2 octets         |
   |              |  Key Identifier |                  |
   ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
   | RSVP-TE      |  Key Identifier | 48 bits          |
   ---------------|-----------------|-------------------
   | TCP-AO       |  KeyID          | 8 bits           |
   ---------------|-----------------|------------------|
   |IPSEC         |  SPI            | 32 bits          |
   +--------------\-----------------\------------------+

   The key identifier maybe manually be configured or generated by
   automated key management protocol (KMP) which is one ongoing work in
   karp.  One obvious distinction among these routing protocols' SA is
   that the length of key ID is different.  If KMP generates key ID
   according to specific routing protocol, the design of KMP will be
   complex and bound to underlying routing protocol.

   o Cryptographic algorithms and key: For the purpose of authentication
   and integrity protection, the algorithms and keys are used to produce
   message authentication code (MAC), which is used to protect the
   packet on the wire.  Typically, key length is related to a specific
   algorithm as listed in table 2.

   Note: The IPSEC integrity algorithms are taken from Transform Type 3,
   section 3.3.2 of RFC4306.

   The cryptographic algorithms used in routing protocol are almost the

   same except for the protection of BGP, which is based on TCP-AO.
   This case also shows that manual configuration or KMP are also
   required to differentiate underlying routing protocol, which makes
   them complex.

   o Lifetime: It specifies whether the SA is valid or not.  For
   example, OSPFv2 SA [RFC5709] uses four fields (Key Start Accept, Key
   Start Generate, Key Stop Generate, Key Stop Accept) to control the
   lifetime of the SA as listed in table 3.
            Table 3 Lifetime
   +---------------/--------------------+
   | SA of Routing | Fields             |
   | Protocols     |                    |
   |---------------|--------------------|
   | RIPv2         | Start Time         |
   |               | Stop Time          |
   |---------------|--------------------|
   | OSPFv2        | Key Start Accept   |
   |               | Key Start Generate |
   |               | Key Stop Generate  |
   |               | Key Stop Accept    |
   |---------------|--------------------|
   | ISIS          | None               |
   |---------------|--------------------|
   | BFD           | None               |

   | RSVP-TE       | key lifetime       |

   | TCP-AO        |  None              |
   |---------------|--------------------|
   | IPSEC         | time or byte count |
   +---------------\--------------------+

   It can be seen that some routing protocols' SA define lifetime,
   others do not.  This implies that underlying routing protocol does
   not exhibit unified interface to upper layer.  In some cases, a
   rekeying mechanism is used to trigger the lifetime of SA.  However,
   current routing protocol SA does not specify what to do when the key
   expires.

   o Sequence number: Sequence number is typically defined to avoid
   replay attacks.  The sequence number fields of current routing
   protocols are listed below.

   |-------------------------------------|
   | IPSEC         |  64bits             |
   +---------------\---------------------+

   The lengths of most underlying routing protocols' sequence number
   above are 32 bits, and others' are 64 bits.  This case also shows
   that manual configuration or KMP are also required to differentiate
   underlying routing protocol, which makes them complex.

2.3.  Discussion of generic security association

   As shown in Section 2.2, each routing protocol has its own SA with
   parameters different from others.  We may call it diversity of
   routing protocol SA.  If we want a KMP work for most if not all
   routing protocols with enhanced security, we need to deal with the
   diversity issue, and the following should be considered.

   1.  Identify the full definition of SA for routing protocols.

   2.  Fulfill or extend the SA for routing protocols if it has not
   reach full definition.

   3.  Identify how to process SA when both IPsec and TCP-AO are in use
   together.

   4. ...

   The advantages to have a KMP like this are as follows:

   1.  It provides a unified interface to manual configuration or KMP

5.  Appendix: Existing SA definition

   This section is for information.  It can be safely removed in the
   future.

5.1.  RIPv2 SA

   RIPv2 Security Association[RFC4822]:

   KEY-IDENTIFIER (KEY-ID) - The unsigned 8-bit KEY-ID value is used to
   identify the RIPv2 Security Association in use for this packet.

   AUTHENTICATION ALGORITHM - This specifies the cryptographic algorithm
   and algorithm mode used with the RIPv2 Security Association.

   AUTHENTICATION KEY - This is the value of the cryptographic
   authentication key used with the associated Authentication Algorithm.

   SEQUENCE NUMBER - This is an unsigned 32-bit number.

   START TIME - This is a local representation of the day and time that
   this Security Association first becomes valid.

   STOP TIME - This is a local representation of the day and time that
   this Security Association becomes invalid.

5.2.  OSPFv2 SA

   OSPFv2 Security Association [RFC5709]:




Wei, et al.              Expires April 27, 2012                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                    RP SA                     October 2011


   Key Identifier (KeyID) - This is an 8-bit unsigned value used to
   uniquely identify an OSPFv2 SA and is configured either by the router
   administrator (or, in the future, possibly by some key management
   protocol specified by the IETF).  The receiver uses this to locate
   the appropriate OSPFv2 SA to use.  The sender puts this KeyID value
   in the OSPF packet based on the active OSPF configuration.

   Authentication Algorithm - This indicates the authentication
   algorithm (and also the cryptographic mode, such as HMAC) to be used.
   This information SHOULD never be sent over the wire in cleartext
   form.  At present, valid values are Keyed-MD5, HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-
   256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512.

   Authentication Key - This is the cryptographic key used for
   cryptographic authentication with this OSPFv2 SA.

   Key Start Accept - The time that this OSPF router will accept packets
   that have been created with this OSPF Security Association.

   Key Start Generate - The time that this OSPF router will begin using
   this OSPF Security Association for OSPF packet generation.

   Key Stop Generate - The time that this OSPF router will stop using
   this OSPF Security Association for OSPF packet generation.

   Key Stop Accept - The time that this OSPF router will stop accepting
   packets generated with this OSPF Security Association.

5.3.  ISIS SA

   An IS-IS Security Association contains a set of parameters shared
   between any two legitimate IS-IS speakers.  Parameters associated
   with an IS-IS SA[RFC5310]:

   Key Identifier (Key ID) - This is a two-octet unsigned integer used
   to uniquely identify an IS-IS SA, as manually configured by the
   network operator.  The receiver determines the active SA by looking
   at the Key ID field in the incoming PDU.  The sender, based on the
   active configuration, selects the Security Association to use and
   puts the correct Key ID value associated with the Security
   Association in the IS-IS PDU.  If multiple valid and active IS-IS
   Security Associations exist for a given outbound interface at the
   time an IS-IS PDU is sent, the sender may use any of those Security
   Associations to protect the packet.

   Authentication Algorithm - This signifies the authentication
   algorithm to be used with the IS-IS SA.  At present, the following
   values are possible: HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-224, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-

   SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512.

   Authentication Key - This value denotes the cryptographic
   authentication key associated with the IS-IS SA.  The length of this
   key is variable and depends upon the authentication algorithm
   specified by the IS-IS SA.

5.4.  BFD SA

   The BFD protocol does not include an in-band mechanism to create or
   manage BFD Security Associations (BFD SA).  A BFD SA contains a set
   of shared parameters between any two legitimate BFD routers.
   Parameters associated with a BFD SA[draft-bhatia-bfd-crypto-auth]:

   Authentication Key Identifier (Key ID) - This is a two octet unsigned
   integer used to uniquely identify the BFD SA, as manually configured
   by the network operator (or, in the future, possibly by some key
   management protocol specified by the IETF).  The receiver determines
   the active SA by looking at this field in the incoming packet.  The
   sender puts this Key ID in the BFD packet based on the active
   configuration.

   Authentication Algorithm - This indicates the authentication
   algorithm to be used with the BFD SA.  The following values are
   possible: Keyed MD5, Keyed SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-
   384 and HMAC-SHA-512.

   Authentication Key - This indicates the cryptographic key associated
   with this BFD SA.  The length of this key is variable and depends
   upon the authentication algorithm specified by the BFD SA.

5.5.  RSVP-TE SA

   RSVP-TE Security Association [RFC2747]:

   Key Identifier - An unsigned 48-bit number that MUST be unique for a
   given sender.  Locally unique Key Identifiers can be generated using
   some combination of the address (IP or MAC or LIH) of the sending
   interface and the key number.  The combination of the Key Identifier
   and the sending system's IP address uniquely identifies the security
   association.

   Sequence Number - An unsigned 64-bit monotonically increasing, unique
   sequence number.  Sequence Number values may be any monotonically
   increasing sequence that provides the INTEGRITY object [of each RSVP
   message] with a tag that is unique for the associated key's lifetime.

   Authentication algorithm and algorithm mode being used.

   Key used with the authentication algorithm.

   Lifetime of the key.

   Associated sending interface and other security association selection
   criteria [REQUIRED at Sending System].

   Source Address of the sending system [REQUIRED at Receiving System].

   Latest sending sequence number used with this key identifier
   [REQUIRED at Sending System].

   List of last N sequence numbers received with this key identifier
   [REQUIRED at Receiving System].

5.6.  BGP

   BGP uses TCP-AO as its security mechanim.

   A Master Key Tuple (MKT) describes TCP-AO properties to be associated
   with one or more connections.  It is composed of the
   following[RFC5925]:

   IDs - The values used in the KeyID or RNextKeyID of a TCP-AO option;
   used to differentiate MKTs in concurrent use (KeyID), as well as to
   indicate when MKTs are ready for use in the opposite direction
   (RNextKeyID).  Each MKT has two IDs - a SendID and a RecvID.  The
   SendID is inserted as the KeyID of the TCP-OP option of outgoing
   segments, and the RecvID is matched against the KeyID of the TCP-AO
   option of incoming segments.  MKT IDs MUST support any value, 0-255
   inclusive.  There are no reserved ID values.

   Master key - A byte sequence used for generating traffic keys, this
   may be derived from a separate shared key by an external protocol
   over a separate channel.

   Implementations are advised to keep master key values in a private,
   protected area of memory or other storage.

   Key Derivation Function (KDF) - Indicates the key derivation function
   and its parameters, as used to generate traffic keys from master
   keys.

   Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm - Indicates the MAC
   algorithm and its parameters as used for this connection.

5.7.  ospfv3

   Ospfv3 uses IPSEC as its security mechanism.  The IPSEC SA is defined
   in [RFC4301]:

   Security Parameter Index (SPI)- a 32-bit value selected by the
   receiving end of an SA to uniquely identify the SA.  In an SAD entry
   for an outbound SA, the SPI is used to construct the packet's AH or
   ESP header.  In an SAD entry for an inbound SA, the SPI is used to
   map traffic to the appropriate SA.

   Sequence Number Counter - a 64-bit counter used to generate the
   Sequence Number field in AH or ESP headers. 64-bit sequence numbers
   are the default, but 32-bit sequence numbers are also supported if
   negotiated.

   Sequence Counter Overflow - a flag indicating whether overflow of the
   sequence number counter should generate an auditable event and
   prevent transmission of additional packets on the SA, or whether
   rollover is permitted.  The audit log entry for this event SHOULD
   include the SPI value, current date/time, Local Address, Remote
   Address, and the selectors from the relevant SAD entry.

   Anti-Replay Window - a 64-bit counter and a bit-map (or equivalent)
   used to determine whether an inbound AH or ESP packet is a replay.

   AH Authentication algorithm, key, etc - This is required only if AH
   is supported.

   ESP Encryption algorithm, key, mode, IV, etc - If a combined mode
   algorithm is used, these fields will not be applicable.

   ESP integrity algorithm, keys, etc - If the integrity service is not
   selected, these fields will not be applicable.  If a combined mode
   algorithm is used, these fields will not be applicable.

   ESP combined mode algorithms, key(s), etc - This data is used when a
   combined mode (encryption and integrity) algorithm is used with ESP.
   If a combined mode algorithm is not used, these fields are not
   applicable.

   Lifetime of this SA - a time interval after which an SA must be
   replaced with a new SA (and new SPI) or terminated, plus an
   indication of which of these actions should occur.  This may be
   expressed as a time or byte count, or a simultaneous use of both with
   the first lifetime to expire taking precedence.  A compliant
   implementation MUST support both types of lifetimes, and MUST support
   a simultaneous use of both.  If time is employed, and if IKE employs

   X.509 certificates for SA establishment, the SA lifetime must be
   constrained by the validity intervals of the certificates, and the
   NextIssueDate of the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) used in the
   IKE exchange for the SA.

   IPsec protocol mode - tunnel or transport.  Indicates which mode of
   AH or ESP is applied to traffic on this SA.

   Stateful fragment checking flag - Indicates whether or not stateful
   fragment checking applies to this SA.

   Bypass DF bit (T/F) - applicable to tunnel mode SAs where both inner
   and outer headers are IPv4.  DSCP values - the set of DSCP values
   allowed for packets carried over this SA.  If no values are
   specified, no DSCP-specific filtering is applied.  If one or more
   values are specified, these are used to select one SA among several
   that match the traffic selectors for an outbound packet.  Note that
   these values are NOT checked against inbound traffic arriving on the
   SA.

   Bypass DSCP (T/F) or map to unprotected DSCP values (array) if needed
   to restrict bypass of DSCP values - applicable to tunnel mode SAs.
   This feature maps DSCP values from an inner header to values in an
   outer header, e.g., to address covert channel signaling concerns.

   Path MTU - any observed path MTU and aging variables.

   Tunnel header IP source and destination address - both addresses must
   be either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  The version implies the type of IP
   header to be used.  Only used when the IPsec protocol mode is tunnel.

5.8.  PCE

   PCEP uses TCP-AO as its message authentication mechanism, as
   discussed in [RFC5440].

5.9.  LDP

   LDP uses TCP-AO as its message authentication mechanism, as discussed
   in [RFC5036].

5.10.  LMP

   LMP uses IPsec as its message authentication mechanism, as discussed
   in [RFC4204].

5.11.  MSDP

   MSDP uses TCP-AO as its message authentication mechanism, as
   discussed in [RFC3618].

5.12.  RSVP-TE

   The RSVP-TE protocol is defined in [RFC3209].  It poses no security
   exposures over and above the base RSVP protocol defined in [RFC2205].
   The RSVP protocol uses IPSEC as its message authentication mechanism,
   as discussed in [RFC2205].

5.13.  PIM

   PIM uses IPSEC as its message authentication mechanism, as discussed
   in [RFC4601].
