Internet-Draft   Link Relation Registrations for OAuth 2   February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the link relation type [RFC5988] registrations
   for the OAuth 2 [RFC6749] authentication framework and for OAuth 1.0a
   [RFC5849].  These link relation types are used during the discovery
   process by clients needing to discover the entry points for OAuth
   authorization, token, and initiation for a service or site.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms used in the OAuth
   2 and OAuth 1.0a specifcations.  OAuth uses the term "endpoint"
   instead of "entry point", this document will generlaly use the term
   "entry point" unless an OAuth specific term is needed.

3.  OAuth 2 Link Relation Types

   OAuth 2 [RFC6749] defines two entry points which a site or domain
   might need to advertize.  These are the user authorization endpoint
   (usually expected to be a web page the user interacts with) and the
   token endpoint used for obtaining tokens used to access protected
   resources.  These are described in detail in Section 3 of the OAuth 2
   specification.

3.1.  The "oauth2-authorize" Link Relation Type

   This link type indicates a resource that provides an OAuth 2
   authorization endpoint to be used for user authentication/
   authorization to grant access to a protected resource.

3.2.  The "oauth2-token" Link Relation Type

   The OAuth 2 token endpoint to be used for obtaining tokens to access
   protected services.  This link type has two link-extensions:



      grant-types:  A space separated list of OAuth 2 grant types (see
         section 4 of [RFC6749]) that can be used at the token endpoint
         to obtain a token.  This is not an exclusive list, it provides
         a hint to the application of what SHOULD be valid.  A token
         endpoint MAY support additional grant types not advertised by a
         discovery service.  The client MAY use this to determine the
         grant types available for use.

      token-types:  A space separated list of OAuth 2 token types (see
         section 7.1 of [RFC6749]) that may be issued by the token
         endpoint.  It is possible for a token endpoint to issue
         multiple tokens, and types may vary based on scope or other
         factors.  This is not an exclusive list, it provides a hint to
         the application of what SHOULD be valid, and it MAY be used by
         a client to determine if the client supports one or more of the
         token type(s) available.

4.  OAuth 1.0a Link Relation Types

   The OAuth 1.0a [RFC5849] protocol defines three entry points that a
   site supporting OAuth 1.0a might advertize: the request initiation
   endpoint, the authorization endpoint, and the token endpoint.  These
   are descibed in detail in Section 2 of the OAuth 1.0a specification.

4.1.  The "oauth-initiate" Link Relation Type

   The OAuth 1.0a entry point used to initiate the sequence, this short
   lived request is what the user approves to grant access to the
   resource.

4.2.  The "oauth-authorize" Link Relation Type

   The OAuth 1.0a authorization entry point used to approve an access
   request.  This is expected to be a user facing web interface.

4.3.  The "oauth-token" Link Relation Type

   The OAuth 1.0a token API entry point used to exchange an approved
   access request for a token, used by the client once the resource
   owner has approved the access request.

   registries, and as such has no security properties to discuss.
