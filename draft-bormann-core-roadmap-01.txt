                     draft-bormann-core-roadmap-01

Abstract

   The CoRE set of protocols, in particular the CoAP protocol, is
   defined in draft-ietf-core-coap in conjunction with a number of
   specifications that are currently nearing completion.  There are also
   several dozen more individual Internet-Drafts in various states of
   development, with various levels of WG review and interest.

   Today, this is simply a bewildering array of documents.  Beyond the
   main four documents, it is hard to find relevant information and
   assess the status of proposals.  At the level of Internet-Drafts, the
   IETF has only adoption as a WG document to assign status - too crude
   an instrument to assess the level of development and standing for
   anyone who does not follow the daily proceedings of the WG.

   With a more long-term perspective, as additional drafts mature and
   existing specifications enter various levels of spec maintenance, the
   entirety of these specifications may become harder to understand,
   pose specific implementation problems, or be simply inconsistent.

   The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents as
   well as provide specific advice how to use these specifications in
   combination.  In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even
   corrections to the specifications referenced.

   This guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress, i.e. a long-
   lived Internet-Draft, to be updated whenever new information becomes
   available and new consensus on how to handle issues is formed.
   Similar to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC 4815, it might be
   published as an RFC at some future time later in the acceptance curve
   of the specifications.

   This document does not describe a new protocol or attempt to set a
   new standard of any kind - it mostly describes good practice in using
   the existing specifications, but it may also document emerging
   consensus where a correction needs to be made.

   The current version -00 of this document is an early draft that is
   intended to spark the further collection of relevant information.

1.  Introduction

   (To be written - for now please see the Abstract.)

1.1.  Terminology

   This document is a guide.  However, it might evolve to make specific
   recommendations on how to use standards-track specifications.
   Therefore: The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119.  They indicate requirement levels for compliant CoRE
   implementations [RFC2119].  Note that these keywords are not only
   used where a correction or clarification is intended; the latter are
   explicitly identified as such.

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

2.  The Main Four

   The main component of the CoRE architecture is the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP).  It aims to provide a RESTful transfer
   service, not unlike HTTP, but radically simplified for the use on
   constrained devices on constrained networks.  REST is the
   architectural style that informed the design of HTTP [REST].  The
   terms "constrained device" and "constrained network" refer to
   limited-capability devices such as sensors operating on networks such
   as the IEEE 802.15.4 based 6LoWPAN [RFC4919].
   [I-D.bormann-lwig-guidance] provides a more detailed discussion of
   what we mean by these terms.

2.1.  The CoAP protocol

   The CoAP protocol is defined in three specifications:

   o  [I-D.ietf-core-coap]

   o  [I-D.ietf-core-block]

   o  [I-D.ietf-core-observe]

   The first specification, [I-D.ietf-core-coap], provides the core
   transfer protocol, including the means to provide communication
   security using the DTLS protocol [RFC6347] (compare this to the way
   [RFC2616] and [RFC2818] define HTTP and HTTPS).  The protocol is
   structured into a message layer, which provides duplicate detection
   and optional message reliability on top of UDP, and a request/
   response layer, which provides the usual REST operations GET, PUT,
   POST, and DELETE.  A highly efficient protocol encoding carries the
   4-byte base header, a sequence of _Options_, and the payload (body)
   of a message.  The main extension points of CoAP are its Options,
   similar to the way new header fields are used to extend HTTP.

   Since CoAP is a very simple protocol based on UDP, it is limited in
   its transfer size by the datagram sizes provided by UDP.  As a
   further constraint, many constrained networks do not provide good
   reliability of delivery once their small frame sizes are exceeded and
   the adaptation layer is forced to fragment [WEI].  This may lead to a
   practical limitation to payload sizes as small as 64 bytes.
   [I-D.ietf-core-block] extends the base CoAP protocol with three
   options that enable _blockwise_ transfer, i.e., splitting up a larger
   transfer into a sequence of smaller transactions, as well as the
   early determination of the overall size of the resource
   representation.

   In HTTP, transactions are always client initiated, and it is the



Bormann                  Expires October 8, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    CoRE Roadmap and Implementation Guide       April 2012


   responsibility of the client to perform GET operations again and
   again (polling) if it wants to stay up to date about the status of a
   resource.  This "pull model" becomes expensive in an environment with
   limited power, limited network resources, and nodes that sleep most
   of the time.  Some more or less savory workarounds have been
   developed for HTTP [RFC6202], but, as a new protocol, CoAP can do
   better.  [I-D.ietf-core-observe] extends the base CoAP protocol with
   an option that a client can use to indicate its interest in further
   updates from a resource.  If the server accepts this option, the
   client becomes an _Observer_ of this resource and receives an
   asynchronous notification message each time it changes.  Each such
   notification message is identical in structure to the response to the
   initial GET request.

   While the "Block" and "Observe" specifications are optional additions
   to the CoAP protocol (just as the core specification already defines
   14 options most of which will not need to be used in every message),
   they together form what is now generally considered to be the CoAP
   protocol.  All three CoAP specifications are, at the time of this
   writing, in Working-Group Last-Call [RFC2418], a prerequisite to
   submitting them to the IESG for publication as a Standards-Track RFC.
   The specifications, together with link-format (below), have been
   widely implemented in highly interoperable implementations: the
   recent ETSI "plugtest" event was attended by 15 organizations with 20
   implementations; in over 3000 tests performed only about 6 % failed.

2.2.  Discovery

   The fourth specification in the main set now nearing completion does
   not extend the CoAP protocol but addresses a different problem.

   In the Web, a number of methods for discovery of resources are
   common.  Initially, Web discovery was just performed by humans based
   on an entry resource to a server (e.g., "/index.html").  This
   resource then includes links that directly or indirectly allow a
   human to reach the other Web resources that make up the Web site.

   Web discovery can be performed by machines if standardized interfaces
   and resource descriptions are available.  Among the component
   mechanisms for Web discovery that are standardized in the IETF are
   the well-known resource path "/.well-known/..."  [RFC5785] and the
   HTTP link header [RFC5988].  Several related techniques are in common
   use today.

   Clearly, in the machine-to-machine environments that will be typical
   of CoAP applications, it is important to enable devices to discover
   each other and their resources.  Autonomous devices and embedded
   systems necessitate uniform, interoperable resource discovery.



Bormann                  Expires October 8, 2012                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    CoRE Roadmap and Implementation Guide       April 2012


   A basic component for this is provided by a standardized description
   format for the resources a server provides, the _link-format_.
   Unless other methods of discovery are available, CoAP servers should
   provide such a description via the well-known URI
   "/.well-known/core", available for access via a GET request on that
   URI.  (More advanced resource discovery schemes might make the same
   description available by other means, e.g. by posting it to a
   resource directory.)

   The description format has been adapted from the format used in the
   HTTP link header [RFC5988], which is simple and easy to parse.  In
   contrast to the HTTP specification, link-format is specified as an
   Internet media type (what used to be called "MIME type") and intended
   to be carried around in the payload [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].

   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format] has passed Working-Group Last-Call and
   was submitted to the IESG and started IETF last-call on 2012-02-14.
   With several very good comments received during the IETF-wide review
   process, another revision is expected before publication as a
   Standards-Track RFC, but there will be few implications on the
   interoperability of current implementations.

2.3.  Further reading

   A recent article provides a more detailed overview over the CoRE
   documents nearing completion [SB].

   While the specification documents themselves have to go into
   meticulous details on every aspect of their protocols, they are the
   ultimate reference source and are the recommended reading if this
   basic overview is not sufficient.

3.  Informational Drafts

3.1.  Implementation

   In the IETF, a separate working group is working on informational
   documents concerning guidance in lightweight implementation of
   protocols, the LWIG working group.  LWIG has several drafts pertinent
   here:

   [I-D.bormann-lwig-guidance] is the main working document of the WG.
   It contains some discussion about CoAP implementation in its section
   3.4.2, including the efficient representation of managing duplicate
   detection state.

   [I-D.castellani-lwig-coap-separate-responses] contains some examples
   for message exchanges, focusing on elaborating exchanges involving
   separate responses.

3.2.  Multicast and Group Communication

   As it is based on UDP, CoAP easily supports the use of IP multicast
   to confer messages.  However, there are difficult issues around
   making the desirable multicast applications actually work well.

   This led to an additional milestone on the CoRE charter:

   Nov 2012:  Using CoAP for group communications to IESG as
      Informational

   The WG draft [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] is still in an explorative
   mode and will require additional investigation before conclusive
   results become available.

3.3.  Security

   Several individual drafts analyze the issues around the security of
   constrained devices in constrained networks.

   | draft-garcia-core-security         | 2012-03-26 |
   | draft-sarikaya-core-sbootstrapping | 2011-10-31 |

                                 Figure 1

   The approach favored by the latter draft is extended towards pre-
   shared keys (PSK, symmetric cryptography) in
   [I-D.ohba-core-eap-based-bootstrapping].

   draft-yegin-coap-security-options-00 was more of a trial balloon to

Internet-Draft    CoRE Roadmap and Implementation Guide       April 2012


   explore one approach that is not actively pursued.

   [I-D.hartke-core-codtls] looks specifically into the use of DTLS in
   constrained networks.  It raises issues that pertain both to the LWIG
   and CoRE working groups of the IETF.

3.4.  Intermediaries

   [I-D.castellani-core-http-mapping] discusses some ideas about what
   HTTP/CoAP intermediaries could do beyond the basic mapping defined in
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  In the IETF83 WG meeting, it was discussed to
   evolve this draft into one document describing best practices for
   mapping between HTTP and CoAP (beyond what is already described in
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap]), and one document that describes usages that
   serve as additional useful examples for more advanced forms of
   mapping.

   ([I-D.moritz-core-proxy-encode] is one proposal to add an option to
   influence the behavior of such intermediaries.)

4.  CoAP over X

   [I-D.becker-core-coap-sms-gprs] shows how to run CoAP over cellular
   SMS and in mixed SMS/GPRS environments.

   [I-D.hartke-core-coap-xmpp] discusses interfacing to XMPP
   (colloquially known as the Jabber protocol).

Internet-Draft    CoRE Roadmap and Implementation Guide       April 2012


5.  Optional components of CoRE

   Additional sub-protocols are being discussed in the IETF that may
   become optional protocols in CoREs.

   This document will track these sub-protocols and be amended once the
   sub-protocols reach formal status in the IETF.

   Since the WG is cautious in adopting additional work while the main
   specifications near completion, none of the additional protocols
   proposed have become WG documents yet.

5.1.  CoAP-misc

   One draft is a little different from the other drafts in this
   category: [I-D.bormann-coap-misc] is a running document capturing
   CoAP extensions that are in various states of being cooked.

   Some of these extensions may finally be adopted for the WG documents
   and then vanish from CoAP-misc.  For other extensions, we may decide
   that they are not very good ideas.  Instead of deleting them from
   CoAP-misc, they are moved to an appendix.  This documents the
   approach, the best implementation of that approach that was reached,
   and the reasons why it was not adopted.  This documentation should
   spare the WG and its contributors from the continuous reinvention of
   bad ideas.

   Small extensions documented in CoAP-misc that might become part of
   the WG documents soon and that are not mentioned elsewhere, currently
   include:

   o  vendor-specific option (Section 3)

5.2.  Patience, Leisure, Pledge, or: Timing extensions

   Several proposals intend to extend the amount of information
   available during an exchange about the timing requirements of the
   participants.

   | draft-li-core-coap-patience-option | 2012-02-27 |

                                 Figure 2

   Another discussion is in Section 4 of [I-D.bormann-coap-misc].

   The question of whether some of this functionality should be
   introduced into the main WG documents now is currently also the
   subject of an active issue tracker ticket [CoRE204].

5.3.  Extending Observe

5.3.1.  gap-free data monitoring

   Observe, as defined, attempts to achieve eventual consistency only
   (as an extension of "data retrieval").  In other words, not every
   intermediate state of a resource is guaranteed to be captured by a
   client ("data monitoring").

   [I-D.loreto-core-coap-streaming] appears to be extending Observe
   towards more comprehensive data monitoring, in this case for e.g.
   streaming camera data.  For this, the sequence number information
   contained in the Observe option is interpreted similar to the
   sequence number in an RTP packet [RFC3550].

5.3.2.  more control for the client

   Observe is not trying to create another one of those complex publish-
   subscribe architectures, CoAP effectively provides a minimal
   enhancement to the REST model: just adding the well-known Observer
   pattern.  The server is in total control of when the updates are
   sent.

   Several proposals have been made to provide more control to the
   client.  Obviously, the URI can be used to relay specific information
   such as thresholds and time spans.  A proposal to add CoAP options
   for this is:

   | draft-li-core-conditional-observe | 2012-03-12 |

                                 Figure 3

5.4.  Service discovery

   Basic service discovery is defined in [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].  A
   JSON representation of the same information is defined in
   [I-D.bormann-core-links-json].  The intention is to make this
   information available in an equivalent format that is more accessible
   to classic Web servers, both as a file format (Internet media type)
   and as a format that can be used in e.g. a JavaScript API.

   [I-D.shelby-core-interfaces] provides additional semantics that can
   be used to make resource descriptions more directly machine-
   interpretable.  This ties in to a more general discussion about CoRE
   profiles that has only just begun.

   [I-D.arkko-core-dev-urn] defines a new Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   namespace that can be used to provide hardware device identifiers in

Internet-Draft    CoRE Roadmap and Implementation Guide       April 2012


   resource descriptions.

5.5.  Server discovery, Naming, etc.

   On the boundary between service and server discovery, resource
   directory servers provide a way to collect resource descriptions from
   multiple servers into one accessible location.

   [I-D.bormann-core-simple-server-discovery] provides a basic way to
   discover such servers in a constrained node/network without
   necessarily having to resort to multicast.

   [I-D.shelby-core-resource-directory] defines protocol elements that
   can be used for setting up such a resource directory.

   [I-D.nieminen-core-service-discovery] extends this discussion towards
   Constrained Application Autoconfiguration.

   Additional drafts include:

   | draft-ma-core-dhcp-pd         | 2012-03-12 |
   | draft-cao-core-pd             | 2012-03-12 |
   | draft-he-core-energy-aware-pd | 2011-10-24 |

                                 Figure 4

   An attempt to merge mDNS/DNS-SD-based discovery (colloquially known
   as zeroconf or Bonjour), including recent approaches to extend these
   for constrained networks, into the picture is documented in
   [I-D.vanderstok-core-dna].

5.6.  More support for sleepy nodes

   The basic communication model of CoAP was imported from the Web. This
   applies well to some communication requirements in constrained node/
   networks, but leaves some other requirements open.

   The assumption underlying the current set of WG documents is that the
   communication layers below the application provide support functions
   for sleeping nodes.  Adding support at the application layer might be
   able to further reduce the power requirements of nodes that can sleep
   most of the time.  A number of drafts aim to extend the CoAP
   communication model towards more support for sleepy nodes.

   This is currently a very active subject of discussion in the WG; it
   is clear that there is a high level of interest in the WG in

6.  Replaced drafts

   Internet-Drafts often get replaced by merged drafts or get promoted
   to WG drafts.  As the relationships between drafts are not always
   accurately captured by the secretariat tools, this table provides a
   mapping from current drafts to any previous drafts they are
   replacing:

   +---------------------------------+--------------------------------+
