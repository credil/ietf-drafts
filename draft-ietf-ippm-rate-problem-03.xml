    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There are many possible rate measurement scenarios. This memo
      describes one rate measurement problem and presents a rate-measurement
      problem statement for test protocols to measure IP Performance Metrics
      (IPPM).</t>

      <t>When selecting a form of access to the Internet, subscribers are
      interested in the performance characteristics of the various
      alternatives. Standardized measurements can be a basis for comparison
      between these alternatives. There is an underlying need to coordinate
      measurements that support such comparisons, and test control protocols
      to fulfill this need. The figure below depicts some typical measurement
      points of access networks.</t>

      <t><figure>

 Device  ----- Copper -------  Access Node -|--- Infrastructure --- GW
 or Host ------ Radio -------  Access Node / 
]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>The access-rate scenario or use case has received wide-spread
      attention of Internet access subscribers and seemingly all Internet
      industry players, including regulators. This problem is being approached
      with many different measurement methods.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The scope and purpose of this memo is to define the measurement
      problem statement for test protocols conducting access rate measurement
      on production networks. Relevant test protocols include <xref
      target="RFC4656"/> and <xref target="RFC5357"/>, but the problem is
      stated in a general way so that it can be addressed by any existing test
      protocol, such as <xref target="RFC6812"/>.</t>

      <t>This memo discusses possibilities for methods of measurement, but
      does not specify exact methods which would normally be part of the
      solution, not the problem.</t>

      <t>We are interested in access measurement scenarios with the following
      characteristics:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The Access portion of the network is the focus of this problem
          statement. The user typically subscribes to a service with
          bi-directional access partly described by rates in bits per second.
          The rates may be expressed as raw capacity or restricted capacity as
          described in <xref target="RFC6703"/>. These are the quantities that
          must be measured according to one or more standard metrics, and for
          which measurement methods must also be agreed as a part of the
          solution.</t>

          <t>Referring to the reference path defined in <xref
          target="I-D.morton-ippm-lmap-path"/>, possible measurement points
          include a Subscriber's host, the access service demarcation point,
          Intra IP access where a globally routable address is present, or the
          gateway between the measured access network and other networks.
          <figure align="center">

              <postamble>GRA = Globally Routable Address, GW =
              Gateway</postamble>
            </figure></t>

          <t>Rates at some links near the edge of the provider's network can
          often be several orders of magnitude less links in than aggregation
          and core portions of the network.</t>

          <t>Asymmetrical access rates on ingress and egress are
          prevalent.</t>

          <t>Extremely large scale of access services requires low complexity
          devices participating at the user end of the path.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This problem statement assumes that the most-likely bottleneck device
      or link is adjacent to the remote (user-end) measurement device, or is
      within one or two router/switch hops of the remote measurement
      device.</t>

      <t>Other use cases for rate measurement involve situations where the
      packet switching and transport facilities are leased by one operator
      from another and the link capacity available cannot be directly
      determined (e.g., from device interface utilization). These scenarios
      could include mobile backhaul, Ethernet Service access networks, and/or
      extensions of layer 2 or layer 3 networks. The results of rate
      measurements in such cases could be employed to select alternate
      routing, investigate whether capacity meets some previous agreement,
      and/or adapt the rate of traffic sources if a capacity bottleneck is
      found via the rate measurement. In the case of aggregated leased
      networks, available capacity may also be asymmetric. In these cases, the
      tester is assumed to have a sender and receiver location under their
      control. We refer to this scenario below as the aggregated leased
      network case.</t>

      <t>Support of active measurement methods will be addressed here,
      consistent with the IPPM working group's traditional charter. Active
      measurements require synthetic traffic dedicated to testing, and do not
      make measurements on user traffic.</t>

      <t>As noted in <xref target="RFC2330"/> the actual traffic handling may
      influence the rate measurement results for some forms of access, as it
      may differ between user and test traffic if the test traffic has
      different characteristics, primarily in terms of the packets themselves
      (see section 13 of <xref target="RFC2330"/> for the considerations on
      packet type, or Type-P).</t>

      <t>There are several aspects of Type-P where user traffic may be
      examined and selected for special treatment that may affect transmission
      rates. Without being exhaustive, the possibilities include:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Packet length</t>

          <t>IP addresses</t>

          <t>Transport protocol (where TCP packets may be routed differently
          from UDP)</t>

          <t>Transport Protocol port numbers</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This issue requires further discussion when specific
      solutions/methods of measurement are proposed, but for this problem
      statement it is sufficient to identify the problem and indicate that the
      solution may require an extremely close emulation of user traffic, in
      terms of one or more factors above.</t>

      <t>Although the user may have multiple instances of network access
      available to them, the primary problem scope is to measure one form of
      access at a time. It is plausible that a solution for the single access
      problem will be applicable to simultaneous measurement of multiple
      access instances, but treatment of this scenario is beyond the current
      scope this document.</t>

      <t>A key consideration is whether active measurements will be conducted
      with user traffic present (In-Service testing), or not present
      (Out-of-Service testing), such as during pre-service testing or
      maintenance that interrupts service temporarily. Out-of-Service testing
      includes activities described as "service commissioning", "service
      activation", and "planned maintenance". Opportunistic In-Service testing
      when there is no user traffic present throughout the test interval is
      essentially equivalent to Out-of-Service testing. Both In-Service and
      Out-of-Service testing are within the scope of this problem.</t>

      <t>It is a non-goal to solve the measurement protocol specification
      problem in this memo.</t>

      <t>It is a non-goal to standardize methods of measurement in this memo.
      However, the problem statement will mandate support for one or more
      categories of rate measurement methods in the test protocol and adequate
      control features for the methods in the control protocol (assuming the
      control and test protocols are separate).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Active Rate Measurement">
      <t>This section lists features of active measurement methods needed to
      measure access rates in production networks.</t>

      <t>Coordination between source and destination devices through control
      messages and other basic capabilities described in the methods of IPPM
      RFCs <xref target="RFC2679"/><xref target="RFC2680"/>, and assumed for
      test protocols such as <xref target="RFC5357"/> and <xref
      target="RFC4656"/>, are taken as given.</t>

      <t>Most forms of active testing intrude on user performance to some
      degree. One key tenet of IPPM methods is to minimize test traffic
      effects on user traffic in the production network. Section 5 of <xref
      target="RFC2680"/> lists the problems with high measurement traffic
      rates, and the most relevant for rate measurement is the tendency for
      measurement traffic to skew the results, followed by the possibility of
      introducing congestion on the access link. In-Service testing MUST
      respect these traffic constraints. Obviously, categories of rate
      measurement methods that use less active test traffic than others with
      similar accuracy are preferred for In-Service testing.</t>

      <t>On the other hand, Out-of-Service tests where the test path shares no
      links with In-Service user traffic have none of the congestion or skew
      concerns, but these tests must address other practical matters such as
      conducting measurements within a reasonable time from the tester's point
      of view. Out-of-Service tests where some part of the test path is shared
      with In-Service traffic MUST respect the In-Service constraints.</t>

      <t>The **intended metrics to be measured** have strong influence over
      the categories of measurement methods required. For example, using the
      terminology of <xref target="RFC5136"/>, a it may be possible to measure
      a Path Capacity Metric while In-Service if the level of background
      (user) traffic can be assessed and included in the reported result.</t>

      <t>The measurement *architecture* MAY be either of one-way (e.g., <xref
      target="RFC4656"/>) or two-way (e.g., <xref target="RFC5357"/>), but the
      scale and complexity aspects of end-user or aggregated access
      measurement clearly favor two-way (with low-complexity user-end device
      and round-trip results collection, as found in <xref
      target="RFC5357"/>). However, the asymmetric rates of many access
      services mean that the measurement system MUST be able to evaluate
      performance in each direction of transmission. In the two-way
      architecture, it is expected that both end devices MUST include the
      ability to launch test streams and collect the results of measurements
      in both (one-way) directions of transmission (this requirement is
      consistent with previous protocol specifications, and it is not a unique
      problem for rate measurements).</t>

      <t>The following paragraphs describe features for the roles of test
      packet SENDER, RECEIVER, and results REPORTER.</t>

      <t>SENDER:</t>

      <t>Generate streams of test packets with various characteristics as
      desired (see Section 4). The SENDER may be located at the user end of
      the access path, or may be located elsewhere in the production network,
      such as at one end of an aggregated leased network segment.</t>

      <t>RECEIVER:</t>

      <t>Collect streams of test packets with various characteristics (as
      described above), and make the measurements necessary to support rate
      measurement at the receiving end of an access or aggregated leased
      network segment.</t>

      <t>REPORTER:</t>

      <t>Use information from test packets and local processes to measure
      delivered packet rates, and prepare results in the required format.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Measurement Method Categories">
      <t>The design of rate measurement methods can be divided into two
      phases: test stream design and measurement (SENDER and RECEIVER), and a
      follow-up phase for analysis of the measurement to produce results
      (REPORTER). The measurement protocol that addresses this problem MUST
      only serve the test stream generation and measurement functions.</t>

      <t>For the purposes of this problem statement, we categorize the many
      possibilities for rate measurement stream generation as follows;<list
          style="numbers">
          <t>Packet pairs, with fixed intra-pair packet spacing and fixed or
          random time intervals between pairs in a test stream.</t>

          <t>Multiple streams of packet pairs, with a range of intra-pair
          spacing and inter-pair intervals.</t>

          <t>One or more packet ensembles in a test stream, using a fixed
          ensemble size in packets and one or more fixed intra-ensemble packet
          spacings (including zero spacing, meaning that back-to-back burst
          ensembles and constant rate ensembles fall in this category).</t>

          <t>One or more packet chirps, where intra-packet spacing typically
          decreases between adjacent packets in the same chirp and each pair
          of packets represents a rate for testing purposes.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>For all categories, the test protocol MUST support:</t>

      <t><list style="letters">
          <t>Variable payload lengths among packet streams</t>

          <t>Variable length (in packets) among packet streams or
          ensembles</t>

          <t>Variable IP header markings among packet streams</t>

          <t>Choice of UDP transport and variable port numbers, OR, choice of
          TCP transport and variable port numbers for two-way architectures
          only, OR BOTH.</t>

          <t>Variable number of packets-pairs, ensembles, or streams used in a
          test session</t>
        </list>The items above are additional variables that the test protocol
      MUST be able to identify and control. The ability to revise these
      variables during an established test session is OPTIONAL, as multiple
      test sessions could serve the same purpose.</t>

      <t>The test protocol SHALL support test packet ensemble generation
      (category 3), as this appears to minimize the demands on measurement
      accuracy. Other stream generation categories are OPTIONAL.</t>

      <t>For measurement systems employing TCP Transport protocol, the ability
      to generate specific stream characteristics requires a sender with the
      ability to establish and prime the connection such that the desired
      stream characteristics are allowed. See Mathis' work in progress for
      more background <xref
      target="I-D.mathis-ippm-model-based-metrics"/>.</t>

      <t>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</t>

      <t>The general requirement statements needed to describe an "open-loop"
      TCP sender require some additional discussion. It may be necessary to
      defer specification of the details required to configure and control a
      TCP SENDER for future work.</t>

      <t>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</t>

      <t>It may also be useful to specify a control for Bulk Transfer Capacity
      measurement with fully-specified TCP senders and receivers, as
      envisioned in <xref target="RFC3148"/>, but this would be a brute-force
      assessment which does not follow the conservative tenets of IPPM
      measurement <xref target="RFC2330"/>.</t>

      <t>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</t>

      <t>Measurements for each UDP test packet transferred between SENDER and
      RECEIVER MUST be compliant with the singleton measurement methods
      described in IPPM RFCs <xref target="RFC2679"/><xref target="RFC2680"/>
      (these could be listed later, if desired). The time-stamp information or
      loss/arrival status for each packet MUST be available for communication
      to the protocol entity that collects results.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Test Protocol Control &amp; Generation Requirements">
      <t>Essentially, the test protocol MUST support the measurement features
      described in the sections above. This requires:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Communicating all test variables to the Sender and Receiver</t>

          <t>Results collection in a one-way architecture</t>

          <t>Remote device control for both one-way and two-way
          architectures</t>

          <t>Asymmetric packet size and/or pseudo-one-way test capability in a
          two-way measurement architecture (along with symmetric packet size
          tests in common use)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The ability to control packet size on the tested path and enable
      asymmetrical packet size testing in a two-way architecture are REQUIRED.
      This allows both the conventional symmetric packet size testing and
      asymmetrical packet size testing to employed to solve various aspects of
      rate measurement: real-time communications often have symmetrical
      streams, while file transfers have highly asymmetrical streams in the
      data and acknowledgement traffic directions.</t>

      <t>The test protocol SHOULD enable measurement of the <xref
      target="RFC5136"/> Capacity metric, either Out-of-Service, In-Service,
      or both. Other <xref target="RFC5136"/> metrics are OPTIONAL.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
      live networks are relevant here as well. See <xref target="RFC4656"/>
      and <xref target="RFC5357"/>.</t>

      <t>There may be a serious issue if a proprietary Service Level Agreement
      involved with the access network segment provider were somehow leaked in
      the process of rate measurement. To address this, test protocols SHOULD
      NOT convey this information in a way that could be discovered by
      unauthorized parties.</t>
