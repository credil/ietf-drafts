             PMIPv6 and Network Mobility Problem Statement
                draft-bernardos-netext-pmipv6-nemo-ps-02

Abstract

   The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6
   enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across
   gateways without changing the IP address.

   Current PMIPv6 specification does only support the movement of hosts
   within the localized mobility domain.  A mobile network (commonly
   referred to as a NEMO, NEtwork that MOves) can also benefit from the
   network-based localized mobility support provided by PMIPv6
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pd-pmip], but with some limitations.  This I-D
   describes what can be done with current standardized protocols, and
   describes the problem statement of fully supporting network mobility
   in Proxy Mobile IPv6.

Internet-Draft              PMIPv6 & NEMO PS                  March 2012


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in [RFC5213], provides network-
   based mobility management to hosts connecting to a PMIPv6 domain.
   PMIPv6 introduces two new functional entities, the Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA) and the Mobility Access Gateway (MAG).  The MAG is the
   first layer three hop detecting Mobile Node (MN) attachment and
   providing IP connectivity.  The LMA is the entity assigning one or
   more Home Network Prefixes (HNPs) to the MN and is the topological
   anchor for all traffic from/to the MN.

   The network-based localized mobility support provided by PMIPv6 was
   designed for hosts, so a mobile host can freely roam within the
   PMIPv6 domain, without changing its IP address.  An interesting
   scenario -- which is not supported by current standards (as we will
   explain later in this document) -- is the following: let's consider a
   scenario in which users move around a large area (e.g., an airport,
   an exhibition site, a fairground or even a metropolitan area covered
   by different public transportation systems).  In these areas,
   attachment points to the Internet might be available both in fixed
   locations (such as coffee shops, airport terminals or train stations)
   or in mobile platforms, such as vehicles (e.g., buses that move
   between pavilions at a fair or a train that moves from one terminal
   to another at an airport).  Users demand the ability to keep their
   ongoing communications while changing their point of attachment to
   the network as they move around (e.g., when a user leaves a coffee
   shop and gets on a bus).

   While PMIPv6 [RFC5213] is the solution specified to provide network-
   based localized mobility support (which nicely fits the requirements
   related to providing Internet access in a large area, such as in the
   use cases described above), and the NEMO Basic Support Protocol
   [RFC3963] is the solution to provide transparent network mobility
   support to a set of nodes moving together (which nicely fits the
   requirements related to providing Internet access to users in mobile
   platforms, such in the use cases described above), these two
   solutions cannot fully cope -- neither working standalone nor in a
   combined fashion -- with the kind of use case introduced above.  We
   need therefore a solution -- which may be for example based on
   extending NEMO mechanisms, extending PMIPv6 or both -- to address
   this scenario.  We next explain with a bit more detail the problem
   statement of combining PMIPv6 with network mobility support and
   explain why current IETF standards are not able to fully tackle this
   problem.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms defined in
   [RFC5213], [RFC3753] and [RFC4885].  In addition, the following terms
   are used in the context of this problem statement:

   MR/MAG

      We use this term to refer to the router providing connectivity to
      a set of nodes moving together.  We do not use the term Mobile
      Router (MR) to avoid confusion with its well accepted meaning in
      the context of the NEMO Basic Support protocol (i.e. we do not
      assume nor prevent the MR/MAG to implement the MR functionality
      specified in [RFC3963]).  Analogously, since the nodes attached to
      the MR/MAG are expected to obtain network-based localized mobility
      support, it might be tempting to refer to this entity as a MAG,
      but an RFC 5213-compliant MAG cannot move (i.e. change its point
      of attachment within the PMIPv6 domain).

   Network Mobility

      Within the scope of this document, we refer to network mobility as
      the capacity of a set of nodes -- attached to an MR/MAG -- to move
      together _within_ the PMIPv6 domain (similarly as done in
      [I-D.ietf-netext-pd-pmip]).  We do not consider the case of mobile
      networks that may roam across PMIPv6 domains (i.e. global
      mobility).  Although this scenario might be also interesting,
      current PMIPv6 does not support inter-domain mobility, thus we
      limit the scope of the problem statement to the same of PMIPv6.


3.  PMIPv6 and Network  Mobility Problem Statement

   Figure 1 shows an example of the use case scenario described in
   Section 1.  Let's consider a very simple PMIPv6 domain composed of
   one LMA and two MAGs: MAG 1 and MAG 2.  There are three MNs: MN 1, MN
   2 and MN 3.  Additionally, there is also an MR/MAG: MER/MAG 1.  The
   goal is to enable any MN to freely roam within the PMIPv6 domain,
   without changing its IP address -- and without requiring any mobility
   support nor involvement from the MN -- even if the MN moves between
   the mobile network and the fixed access network (i.e. the MN changes
   its point of attachment from the MR/MAG 1 to the MAG 1 or MAG 2).

3.1.  Applicability of existing standards

   This section briefly analyzes how the use of current standards fails
   to fully support the scenario described in this problem statement:

   1.  PMIPv6 only.  By using PMIPv6 only, a single host (i.e. an MN)
       would be able to freely roam between fixed points of attachment
       (MAG 1 and MAG 2 in Figure 1).  By enabling bridging on an MR/MAG
       attaching to a fixed MAG, some very limited kind of network
       mobility support could be achieved (if the Per-MN-Prefix model
       [RFC5213] is used).  [I-D.ietf-netext-pd-pmip] specifies
       extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 to support network mobility.
       However, none of these approaches do support a mobile node
       leaving the mobile network and attaching to another MAG (or MR/

       MAG) without changing IP address of the mobile node.

   2.  NEMO Basic Support (NEMO B.S.) only.  In this case, MAG 1 and MAG
       2 in the example of Figure 1 would only play the role of plain
       IPv6 Access Routers.  If NEMO B.S is enabled on the MR/MAG (and a
       Home Agent is deployed in the network), a set of nodes would be
       able to freely roam within the domain .  However, an MN would not
       be able to move between the mobile network and the fixed access
       network (because the addresses that nodes may use while connected
       to the MR/MAG would belong to the Mobile Network Prefix -- MNP --
       of the network, which is different from the prefixes provided by
       the LMA within the PMIPv6 domain).  Additionally, this scenario
       requires the deployment of a NEMO B.S. Home Agent (for example at
       the location where the LMA is placed in Figure 1) and involves
       the NEMO B.S. signaling every time the MR/MAG moves.

   3.  NEMO B.S. + PMIPv6: by enabling NEMO B.S. on the MR/MAG and
       deploying PMIPv6 in the domain, we would achieve the same level
       of functionality as the previous case, but saving the NEMO
       signaling required every time the MR/MAG moves, since its Care-of
       Address (CoA) would not change while it is roaming within the
       domain (the address the MR/MAG uses as CoA is anchored at the LMA
       and does not change despite of the MR/MAG movements, thanks to
       the PMIPv6 support).  In this scenario, NEMO B.S. HA and the
       PMIPv6 LMA could be collocated.

   The previous compilation of potential approaches does not consider
   the use of Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] on the MNs, since this would not
   meet the fundamental feature of network-based localized mobility
   solutions (such as PMIPv6): not to involve the MN on the signaling
   nor on the management of its own mobility.

   As shown, with existing standards, there is no way of achieving the
   level of functionality required in our scenario.  It is therefore
   required to work on new solutions/extensions to existing protocols
   (either to the NEMO B.S., to PMIPv6 or to both when working in a
   combined way).


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations regarding the MR/MAG would be needed.  It
   might be safe to assume that the MR/MAG has the same level of trust/

   security that the MAGs of the network, but this may depend on the
   particular solution.
