      Modification to Default Values of SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT
                draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-solmaxrt-update-04

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 3315 by redefining the default values for
   SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT, and defining options through which a
   DHCPv6 server can override the client's default value for SOL_MAX_RT
   and INF_MAX_RT with new values.

1.  Introduction

   Section 5.5 of the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315] defines the default
   values of SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT to be 120 seconds.  In some
   circumstances, these defaults will lead to an unacceptably high
   volume of aggregated traffic at a DHCPv6 server.

   The change to SOL_MAX_RT is in response to DHCPv6 message rates
   observed at a DHCPv6 server in a deployment in which many DHCPv6
   clients are sending Solicit messages but the DHCPv6 server has been
   configured not to respond to those Solicit messages.  While no
   explicit observations of traffic due to INF_MAX_RT have been
   conducted, this document updates INF_MAX_RT for consistency with
   SOL_MAX_RT.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Updates to SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT in RFC 3315

   This document changes section 5.5 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315] as follows:

   OLD:
      SOL_MAX_RT      120 secs  Max Solicit timeout value

   NEW:

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 SOL_MAX_RT Option          September 2013


      SOL_MAX_RT     3600 secs  Max Solicit timeout value

   OLD:
      INF_MAX_RT      120 secs  Max Information-request timeout value

   NEW:
      SOL_MAX_RT     3600 secs  Max Information-request timeout value


   With this change, a DHCPv6 client that does not receive a
   satisfactory response will send Solicit or Information-request
   messages with the same initial frequency and exponential backoff as
   specified in sections 17.1.2 and 18.1.5 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315].
   However, the long term behavior of these DHCPv6 clients will be to
   send a Solicit or Information-request message every 3600 seconds
   rather than every 120 seconds, significantly reducing the aggregated
   traffic at the DHCPv6 server.

4.  SOL_MAX_RT option

   A DHCPv6 server sends the SOL_MAX_RT option to a client to override
   the default value of SOL_MAX_RT.  The value of SOL_MAX_RT in the
   option replaces the default value defined in Section 3.  One use for
   the SOL_MAX_RT option is to set a longer value for SOL_MAX_RT, which
   reduces the Solicit traffic from a client that has not received a
   response to its Solicit messages.

   The format of the SOL_MAX_RT option is:

5.  INF_MAX_RT option

   A DHCPv6 server sends the INF_MAX_RT option to a client to override
   the default value of INF_MAX_RT.  The value of INF_MAX_RT in the
   option replaces the default value defined in Section 3.  One use for
   the INF_MAX_RT option is to set a longer value for INF_MAX_RT, which
   reduces the Information-Request traffic from a client that has not
   received a response to its Information-Request messages.

   The format of the INF_MAX_RT option is:

6.  Updates for SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT options to RFC 3315

   Update to RFC 3315 [RFC3315], section 17.1.3:




   OLD:

   The client MUST ignore any Advertise message that includes a Status
   Code option containing the value NoAddrsAvail, with the exception
   that the client MAY display the associated status message to the
   user.

   NEW:

   The client MUST ignore any Advertise message that includes a Status
   Code option containing the value NoAddrsAvail, with the exception
   that the client MUST process an included SOL_MAX_RT option and MUST
   process an included INF_MAX_RT option and MAY display the associated
   status message to the user.




   Update to RFC 3315 [RFC3315], section 17.2.2:



   OLD:

   If the server will not assign any addresses to any IAs in a
   subsequent Request from the client, the server MUST send an
   Advertise message to the client that includes only a Status Code
   option with code NoAddrsAvail and a status message for the user, a
   Server Identifier option with the server's DUID, and a Client
   Identifier option with the client's DUID.

   NEW:

   If the server will not assign any addresses to any IAs in a
   subsequent Request from the client, the server MUST send an
   Advertise message to the client that includes only a Status Code
   option with code NoAddrsAvail and a status message for the user, a
   Server Identifier option with the server's DUID, a Client
   Identifier option with the client's DUID and (optionally)

   SOL_MAX_RT and/or INF_MAX_RT options.




   Add text to the end of section 14, clarifying client behavior while
   waiting for a response from a server:



   NEW:

   A client is not expected to listen for a response during the entire
   period between transmission of Solicit or Information-Request
   messages.




7.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   A DHCPv6 client MUST include the SOL_MAX_RT option code in any Option
   Request option [RFC3315] it sends as required by RC 3315.

   A DHCPv6 client MUST include the INF_MAX_RT option code in any Option
   Request option [RFC3315] it sends as required by RFC 3315.

   A DHCPv6 client MUST silently ignore any SOL_MAX_RT or INF_MAX_RT
   option values that are less than 60 or more than 86400.

   If a DHCPv6 client receives a message containing a SOL_MAX_RT option
   containing a valid value for SOL_MAX_RT, the client MUST set its
   internal SOL_MAX_RT parameter to the value contained in the
   SOL_MAX_RT option.  This value of SOL_MAX_RT is then used by the
   retransmission mechanism defined in sections 17.1.2 and 14 of RFC
   3315 [RFC3315].

   If a DHCPv6 client receives a message containing a INF_MAX_RT option
   containing a valid value for INF_MAX_RT, the client MUST set its
   internal INF_MAX_RT parameter to the value contained in the
   INF_MAX_RT option.  This value of INF_MAX_RT is then used by the
   retransmission mechanism defined in sections 18.1.5 and 14 of RFC
   3315 [RFC3315].

8.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Sections 17.2.2 and 18.2 of [RFC3315] govern server operation in
   regards to option assignment.  As a convenience to the reader, we

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 SOL_MAX_RT Option          September 2013


   mention here that the server will send option SOL_MAX_RT and
   INF_MAX_RT only if configured with specific values for them and the
   client requested those options using Option Request Option.

   The DHCPv6 server MAY include the SOL_MAX_RT option in any response
   it sends to a client that has included the SOL_MAX_RT option code in
   an Option Request option.  The SOL_MAX_RT option is sent in the main
   body of the message to client, not as a encapsulated option in, e.g.,
   an IA_NA, IA_TA [RFC3315] or IA_PD [RFC3633] option.

   The DHCPv6 server MAY include the INF_MAX_RT option in any response
   it sends to a client that has included the INF_MAX_RT option code in
   an Option Request option.  The INF_MAX_RT option is sent in the main
   body of the message to client, not as a encapsulated option in, e.g.,
   an IA_NA, IA_TA [RFC3315] or IA_PD [RFC3633] option.

9.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior Text

   There are no additional requirements for relays.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces one security consideration beyond those
   described in RFC 3315 [RFC3315].  A malicious DHCPv6 server might
   cause a client to set its SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT parameters to an
   arbitrarily high value with the SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT options,
   which may cause an undue delay in a client completing its DHCPv6
   protocol transaction in the case no other valid response is
   received..  Assuming the client also receives a response from a valid
   DHCPv6 server, large values for SOL_MAX_RT and INF_MAX_RT will not
   have any effect.

11.  Acknowledgments

   Tomek Mrugalski edited the text for compliance with draft-ietf-dhc-
   option-guidelines [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines] and added
   important details to the Security Considerations section.

12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign one option code each for
   OPTION_SOL_MAX_RT and OPTION_INF_MAX_RT from the "DHCP Option Codes"
   table of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
   Registry.
