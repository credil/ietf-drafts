           Text Encodings of Some Security Related Structures
                    draft-josefsson-pkix-textual-00

Abstract

   This document describe and discuss the text encodings of Public-Key
   Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates, PKIX Certificate
   Revocation Lists (CRLs), PKCS #10 Certificate Request Syntax, PKCS #7
   structures, and Attribute Certificates.  The text encodings are well-
   known, implemented by several applications and libraries, and is
   widely deployed.  This document is intended to articulate the de-
   facto rules that existing implementations operate by, and to give
   recommendations that will promote interoperability going forward.

Internet-Draft       Security-Related Text Encodings        January 2012


1.  Introduction

   Several security-related standards used on the Internet define data
   formats that are normally encoded using Distinguished Encoding Rules
   (DER) [CCITT.X690.2002], which is a binary data format.  This
   document is about text encodings of some of these formats.  In
   particular, we describe text encodings for the following formats.

   1.  Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and
       Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile [RFC5280], for both
       Certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
   2.  PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax [RFC2986].
   3.  PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax [RFC2315].
   4.  An Internet Attribute Certificate Profile for Authorization
       [RFC5755].

   One motivation for a text encoding is that a binary data format has
   the disadvantage that it cannot be interchanged in textual
   transports, such as e-mail or text documents.  One advantage with
   text encodings is that they are easy to modify without special-
   purpose tools; for example, using a text editor you may concatenate
   several certificates to form a certificate chain.

   The exact history of the text encodings are unknown to the author of
   this document, however the tradition within the RFC series can be
   traced back to PEM [RFC1421] and OpenPGP [RFC2015].  These text
   encodings are sometimes referred to as "PEM encodings".  Peter
   Gutmann's X.509 Style Guide [X509SG] contains a section "base64
   Encoding" that describe the formats and contains suggestions similar
   to what is in this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].


2.  General Considerations

   The structure of a text encoding is such that they begin with a line
   starting with "-----BEGIN" and end with a line starting with
   "-----END".  Between these markers are Base64 [RFC4648] encoded data.
   Data before the "-----BEGIN" and after the "-----END" marker are
   permitted and MUST NOT cause parsers to malfunction.  Further,
   parsers MUST ignore whitespace and other non-alphabetic characters
   and MUST handle different newline conventions.

   The type of data encoded is labeled depending on the type label in



Josefsson                 Expires July 30, 2012                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Security-Related Text Encodings        January 2012


   the "-----BEGIN" line.  For example, the line may be "-----BEGIN
   CERTIFICATE-----" to indicate that the content is a PKIX Certificate
   (see further below).  Generators MUST put the same label on the
   "-----END" line as the corresponding "-----BEGIN" line.  Parses MAY
   disregard the label on the "-----END" lines instead of signalling an
   error if there is a label mismatch.

   The label type is not a guarantee that the encoded data follows the
   implied syntax.  Parsers MUST handle non-conforming data gracefully.

   Files MAY contain multiple instances of the text encoded
   representation.  This is used, for example, when a file contains
   several certificates.  Whether the instances are ordered or unordered
   depends on the context.

   Generators MUST wrap the base64 encoded lines so that each line
   consists of exactly 64 characters except for the final line which
   will encode as much data is left (within the 64 character line
   boundary).  Parser MAY handle other line sizes.


3.  Text Encoding of PKIX Certificate

   PKIX Certificates are encoded using the "CERTIFICATE" label.  The
   encoded data MUST be a DER encoded ASN.1 "Certificate" structure as
   described in section 4 of [RFC5280].

                       Figure 1: Certificate Example

   Historically the label "X509 CERTIFICATE" and also, less common,
   "X.509 CERTIFICATE" have been used.  Generators conforming to this
   document MUST generate "CERTIFICATE" labels and MUST NOT generate
   "X509 CERTIFICATE" or "X.509 CERTIFICATE" labels.  Parsers are NOT

   RECOMMENDED to treat "X509 CERTIFICATE" or "X.509 CERTIFICATE" as
   equivalent to "CERTIFICATE", but a valid exception may be for
   backwards compatibility (potentially together with a warning).


4.  Text Encoding of PKIX CRLs

   PKIX CRLs are encoded using the "X509 CRL" label.  The encoded data
   MUST be a DER encoded ASN.1 "CertificateList" structure as described
   in section 5 of [RFC5280].

                           Figure 2: CRL Example

   Historically the label "CRL" have been used, but today it is not
   common and several popular tools do not understand the label.
   Generators conforming to this document MUST generate "X509 CRL"
   labels and MUST NOT generate "CRL" labels.  Parsers are NOT
   RECOMMENDED to treat "CRL" as equivalent to "X509 CRL".


5.  Text Encoding of PKCS #10 Certification Request Syntax

   PKCS #10 Certification Requests are encoded using the "CERTIFICATE
   REQUEST" label.  The encoded data MUST be a DER encoded ASN.1
   "CertificationRequest" structure as described in [RFC2986].

                        Figure 3: PKCS #10 Example

   The label "NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST" is also in wide use.  Generators
   conforming to this document MUST generate "CERTIFICATE REQUEST"
   labels.  Parsers MAY treat "NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST" as equivalent to
   "CERTIFICATE REQUEST".


6.  Text Encoding of PKCS #7 Cryptographic Message Syntax

   PKCS #7 Cryptographic Message Syntax structures are encoded using the
   "PKCS7" label.  The encoded data MUST be a DER encoded ASN.1
   "ContentInfo" structure as described in [RFC2315].

   -----BEGIN PKCS7-----

   -----END PKCS7-----

                         Figure 4: PKCS #7 Example

   The label "CERTIFICATE CHAIN" has been in use to denote a
   degenerative PKCS #7 structure that contains only a list of
   certificates.  Several modern tools do not support this label.
   Generators MUST NOT generate the "CERTIFICATE CHAIN" label.  Parsers
   are NOT RECOMMENDED to treat "CERTIFICATE CHAIN" as equivalent to
   "PKCS7".


7.  Text Encoding of Attribute Certificates

   Attribute certificates are encoded using the "ATTRIBUTE CERTIFICATES"
   label.  The encoded data MUST be a DER encoded ASN.1
   "AttributeCertificate" structure as described in [RFC5755].

8.  Non-comforming Examples

   This section contains examples for the non-recommended label variants
   described earlier in this document.  As discussed earlier, supporting
   these are not required and sometimes discouraged.  Still, they can be
   useful for interoperability testing and for easy reference.

9.  Security Considerations

   Data in this format is often originating from untrusted sources, thus
   parsers must be prepared to handle unexpected data without causing
   security vulnerabilities.

Internet-Draft       Security-Related Text Encodings        January 2012


   By having more than one canonical encoding of the same data, an
   ambiguity is introduced.  The first one is introduced by permitting
   the text encoded representation instead of the binary DER encoding,
   but further ambiguities arise when multiple labels are treated as
   similar.  Even further, variations of whitespace and non-base64
   alphabetic characters can further create ambiguities.
   Implementations that rely on canonical representation or the ability
   to fingerprint a particular data format will need to take this into
   account.  Data encoding ambiguities also create opportunities for
   side channels.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document implies no IANA Considerations.


11.  Acknowledgements

   Peter Gutmann suggested to document labels for Attribute Certificates
   and PKCS #7 messages, and to add examples for the non-standard
   variants.
