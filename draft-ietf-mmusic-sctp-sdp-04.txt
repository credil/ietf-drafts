                   Session Description Protocol (SDP)
                     draft-ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp-04

Abstract

   SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a transport protocol
   used to establish associations between two endpoints.  This document
   describes how to express media transport over SCTP in SDP (Session
   Description Protocol).  This document defines the 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS'
   and 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifiers for SDP.

Internet-Draft    The SCTP protocol identifier for SDP         June 2013


1.  Introduction

   SDP (Session Description Protocol) [RFC4566] provides a general-
   purpose format for describing multimedia sessions in announcements or
   invitations.  TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4145] specifies a general mechanism for describing
   and establishing TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) streams.
   Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4572]
   extends RFC4145 [RFC4145] for describing TCP-based media streams that
   are protected using TLS (Transport Layer Security) [RFC5246].

   This document defines three new protocol identifiers:

   SCTP :  to describe SCTP-based [RFC4960] media streams.

   SCTP/DTLS :  to allow the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
      Security (DTLS) [RFC4347] protocol over SCTP, as specified in
      [RFC6083], using SDP.  DTLS over SCTP provides communications
      privacy for applications that use SCTP as their transport
      protocol.

   DTLS/SCTP :  to allow the usage of SCTP on top of the Datagram
      Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol, as defined in
      [I-D.tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps], using SDP.  SCTP over DTLS is
      used by the RTCWeb protocol suite for transporting non-media data
      between browsers.

   The authentication certificates are interpreted and validated as
   defined in RFC4572 [RFC4572].  Self-signed certificates can be used
   securely, provided that the integrity of the SDP description is
   assured as defined in RFC4572 [RFC4572].

   TLS is designed to run on top of a byte-stream oriented transport
   protocol providing a reliable, in-sequence delivery like TCP.  Since
   no-one so far has implemented SCTP over TLS, due to some serious
   limitations described in [RFC6083], this document does not make use
   of TLS over SCTP as described in RFC3436 [RFC3436].

   Additionally, this document specifies the use of the 'setup' and
   'connection' SDP attributes to establish SCTP associations.  These
   attributes were defined in RFC4145 [RFC4145] for TCP.  This document
   discusses their use with SCTP.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",



Loreto & Camarillo       Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    The SCTP protocol identifier for SDP         June 2013


   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Protocol Identifier

   The following is the format for an 'm' line, as specified in RFC4566
   [RFC4566]:

       m=<media> <port> <proto> <fmt> ...

   This document defines three new values for the 'proto' field: 'SCTP',
   'SCTP/DTLS' and 'DTLS/SCTP'.

   The 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS' and 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifiers are
   similar to both the 'UDP' and 'TCP' protocol identifiers in that they
   only describe the transport protocol and not the upper-layer
   protocol.

   Media described using an 'm' line containing the 'SCTP' protocol
   identifier are carried using SCTP [RFC4960].

   The 'SCTP/DTLS' protocol identifier indicates that the media
   described will use the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   [RFC4347] over SCTP as specified in [RFC6083].

   The 'DTLS/SCTP' protocol identifier indicates that the media
   described will use SCTP on top of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol as specified in
   [I-D.tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].  The actual layer below DTLS can
   be plain UDP or what ICE agrees on (in the case ICE is used to
   negotiate the actual transport flow).  The lower layer used is
   identified from the elements present inside the m= line block.

   An 'm' line that specifies 'SCTP' or 'SCTP/DTLS' or 'DTLS/SCTP' MUST
   further qualify the application-layer protocol using an fmt
   identifier.

   An 'm' line that specifies 'SCTP/DTLS' or 'DTLS/SCTP' MUST further
   provide a certificate fingerprint.  An SDP attribute (an 'a' line) is
   used to transport and exchange end point certificate.  The
   authentication certificates are interpreted and validated as defined
   in [RFC4572].

4.  Media Formats

   The SDP specification, [RFC4566], states that specifications defining
   new proto values, like the SCTP, SCTP/DTLS and DTLS/SCTP proto values
   defined in this RFC, must define the rules by which their media
   format (fmt) namespace is managed.  Use of an existing MIME subtype
   for the format is encouraged.  If no MIME subtype exists, it is
   RECOMMENDED that a suitable one is registered through the IETF
   process [RFC4288] [RFC4289] by production of, or reference to, a
   standards-track RFC that defines the transport protocol for the
   format.

4.1.  Media Descriptions

   The media description change slightly depending on the actual
   <proto>.

   If the <proto> sub-field is 'SCTP' or 'SCTP/DTLS'

      the <port> is the SCTP transport port and follows the same active/
      passive offer/answer model described in Section 4.1 of [RFC4145];

      the <fmt> sub-field carries the same port number value specified
      in the <port> and the mandatory "a=sctpmap:" attribute contains
      the actual media format within the protocol parameter.



              m=application 54111 SCTP/DTLS 54111
              a=sctpmap:54111 t38 1


   Running SCTP over DTLS make possible to have multiple SCTP
   associations on top of the same DTLS connection; each SCTP
   association make use of a distinct port number that is mainly used to
   demultiplex the associations.

   If the <proto> sub-field is 'DTLS/SCTP'

      the <port> is the UDP transport port;

      the <fmt> sub-field carries the SCTP port number and the mandatory
      "a=sctpmap:" attribute contains the actual media format within the
      protocol parameter.

   When a list of port number identifiers is given, this implies that
   all of these associations MUST run on top of the same DTLS
   connection.  For the payload type assignments the "a=sctpmap:"

Internet-Draft    The SCTP protocol identifier for SDP         June 2013


   attribute (see Section 5.1) SHOULD be used to map from a port number
   to a media encoding name that identifies the payload format
   transported by the association or the actual application protocol
   running on top of it.


              m=application 54111 DTLS/SCTP 5000 5001 5002
              c=IN IP4 79.97.215.79
              a=sctpmap:5000 webrtc-datachannel 16
              a=sctpmap:5001 bfcp 2
              a=sctpmap:5002 t38 1



5.  Media attributes

5.1.  sctpmap Attribute

   The sctpmap attribute maps from a port number (as used in an "m="
   line) to an encoding name denoting the payload format to be used on
   top of the SCTP association or the actual protocol running on top of
   it.  It also can provide the number of streams to be supported by the
   association.  If this attribute is not present, the implementation
   should provide a default, with a suggested value of 16.


       sctpmap-attr        =  "a=sctpmap:" sctpmap-number  protocol  [streams]
       sctpmap-number      =  1*DIGIT
       protocol            =  labelstring
         labelstring         =  text
         text                =  byte-string
       streams      =  1*DIGIT



6.  The Setup and Connection Attributes and Association Management

   The use of the 'setup' and 'connection' attributes in the context of
   an SCTP association is identical to the use of these attributes in
   the context of a TCP connection.  That is, SCTP endpoints MUST follow
   the rules in Sections 4 and 5 of RFC 4145 [RFC4145] when it comes to
   the use of the 'setup' and 'connection' attributes in offer/answer
   [RFC3264] exchanges.

   The management of an SCTP association is identical to the management
   of a TCP connection.  That is, SCTP endpoints MUST follow the rules
   in Section 6 of RFC 4145 [RFC4145] to manage SCTP associations.
   Whether to use the SCTP ordered or unordered delivery service is up

Internet-Draft    The SCTP protocol identifier for SDP         June 2013


   to the applications using the SCTP association.


7.  Multihoming

   An SCTP endpoint, unlike a TCP endpoint, can be multihomed.  An SCTP
   endpoint is considered to be multihomed if it has more than one IP
   address.  A multihomed SCTP endpoint informs a remote SCTP endpoint
   about all its IP addresses using the address parameters of the INIT
   or the INIT-ACK chunk (depending on whether the multihomed endpoint
   is the one initiating the establishment of the association).
   Therefore, once the address provided in the 'c' line has been used to
   establish the SCTP association (i.e., to send the INIT chunk),
   address management is performed using SCTP.  This means that two SCTP
   endpoints can use addresses that were not listed in the 'c' line but
   that were negotiated using SCTP mechanisms.

   During the lifetime of an SCTP association, the endpoints can add and
   remove new addresses from the association at any point [RFC5061].  If
   an endpoint removes the IP address listed in its 'c' line from the
   SCTP association, the endpoint SHOULD update the 'c' line (e.g., by
   sending a re-INVITE with a new offer) so that it contains an IP
   address that is valid within the SCTP association.

   In some environments, intermediaries performing firewall control use
   the addresses in offer/answer exchanges to perform media
   authorization.  That is, policy-enforcement network elements do not
   let media through unless it is sent to the address in the 'c' line.

   In such network environments, the SCTP endpoints can only exchange
   media using the IP addresses listed in their 'c' lines.  In these
   environments, an endpoint wishing to use a different address needs to
   update its 'c' line (e.g., by sending a re-INVITE with a new offer)
   so that it contains the new IP address.

   It is worth to underline that when using SCTP on top of DTLS, only
   single homed SCTP associations can be used, since DTLS does not
   expose any address management to its upper layer.


8.  Network Address Translation (NAT) Considerations

   SCTP specific features (not present in UDP/TCP), such as the checksum
   (CRC32c) value calculated on the whole packet (not just the header)
   or its multihoming capabilities, present new challenges for NAT
   traversal.  [I-D.ietf-behave-sctpnat] describes an SCTP specific
   variant of NAT, which provides similar features of Network Address
   and Port Translation (NAPT).



Loreto & Camarillo       Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    The SCTP protocol identifier for SDP         June 2013


   Current NATs do not typically support SCTP.  As an alternative to
   design SCTP specific NATs, Encapsulating SCTP into UDP [RFC6951]
   makes it possible to use SCTP in networks with legacy NAT and
   firewalls not supporting SCTP.

   At the time of writing, the work on NAT traversal for SCTP is still
   work in progress.  Additionally, no extension has been defined to
   integrate ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) [RFC5768] with
   SCTP and its multihoming capabilities either.  Therefore, this
   specification does not define how to describe SCTP-over-UDP streams
   in SDP or how to establish and maintain SCTP associations using ICE.
   Should these features be specified for SCTP in the future, there will
   be a need to specify how to use them in an SDP environment as well.


9.  Examples

   The following examples show the use of the 'setup' and 'connection'
   SDP attributes.  As discussed in Section 6, the use of these
   attributes with an SCTP association is identical to their use with a
   TCP connection.  For the purpose of brevity, the main portion of the
   session description is omitted in the examples, which only show 'm'
   lines and their attributes (including 'c' lines).

9.1.  Actpass/Passive

   An offerer at 192.0.2.2 signals its availability for an SCTP
   association at SCTP port 54111.  Additionally, this offerer is also
   willing to initiate the SCTP association:

              m=application 54111 SCTP 54111
              c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
              a=setup:actpass
              a=connection:new
              a=sctpmap:54111 t38 1

                                 Figure 1

   The endpoint at 192.0.2.1 responds with the following description:

              m=image 54321 SCTP 54321
              c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
              a=setup:passive
              a=connection:new
              a=sctpmap:t54321 t38 1

                                 Figure 2

Internet-Draft    The SCTP protocol identifier for SDP         June 2013


   This will cause the offerer (at 192.0.2.2) to initiate an SCTP
   association to port 54321 at 192.0.2.1.

9.2.  Existing Connection Reuse

   Subsequent to the exchange in Section 9.1, another offer/answer
   exchange is initiated in the opposite direction.  The endpoint at
   192.0.2.1, which now acts as the offerer, wishes to continue using
   the existing association:

              m=application 54321 SCTP *
              c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
              a=setup:passive
              a=connection:existing

                                 Figure 3

   The endpoint at 192.0.2.2 also wishes to use the existing SCTP
   association and responds with the following description:

              m=application 54111 SCTP *
              c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
              a=setup:active
              a=connection:existing

                                 Figure 4

   The existing SCTP association between 192.0.2.2 and 192.0.2.1 will be
   reused.

9.3.  SDP description for SCTP over DTLS Connection

   This example shows the usage of SCTP over DTLS.

   An offerer at 192.0.2.2 signals the availability of a T.38 fax
   session over SCTP/DTLS.  The DTLS connection runs on top of port
   54111.

           m=image 54111 DTLS/SCTP 5000
           c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
           a=setup:actpass
           a=connection:new
           a=fingerprint:SHA-1 \
             4A:AD:B9:B1:3F:82:18:3B:54:02:12:DF:3E:5D:49:6B:19:E5:7C:AB
           a=sctpmap:5000 webrtc-DataChannel 16
           a=webrtc-DataChannel:5000 stream:1;label="channel 1";subprotocol="chat";
           a=webrtc-DataChannel:5000 stream:2;label="channel 2";subprotocol="file transfer"

10.  Security Considerations

   See RFC 4566 [RFC4566] for security considerations on the use of SDP
   in general.  See RFC 3264 [RFC3264], RFC 4145 [RFC4145] and RFC 4572
   [RFC4572] for security considerations on establishing media streams
   using offer/answer exchanges.  See RFC 4960 [RFC4960] for security
   considerations on SCTP in general and [RFC6083] for security
   consideration using DTLS on top of SCTP.  This specification does not
   introduce any new security consideration in addition to the ones
   discussed in those specifications.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines three new proto values: 'SCTP', 'SCTP/DTLS' and
   'DTLS/SCTP'.  Their formats are defined in Section 3.  These proto
   values should be registered by the IANA under "Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters" under "proto".

   This document defines two SDP session and media-level attributes:

      'sctpmap'.  Its format is defined in Section 5.1.  This attribute
      should be registered by IANA under "Session Description Protocol
      (SDP) Parameters" under "att-field" (both session and media
      level)".
