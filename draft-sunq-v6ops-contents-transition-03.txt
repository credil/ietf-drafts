        Practice of IPv4/IPv6 transition system for data center
                draft-sunq-v6ops-contents-transition-03

Abstract

   This document describes deployment practice of IPv4/IPv6 translation
   technologies for data center transition, aiming at rapidly increasing
   the amount of IPv6 accessible contents for users from IPv6 Internet
   while preserving the continuity of IPv4 service delivery.  System
   based on this design has been deployed in production network to
   provide transition service for several ICP websites.

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition                March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Facing the pressure of IPv4 address shortage, the operators may like
   to provide services through IPv6 by upgrade their IP infrastructure
   to support IPv6.  As part of the Infrastructure, Data center (in
   short, IDC) is the main faculty to house service system that provides
   services and contents.  It is obvious that data center also plays an
   important role in IPv6 transition in accordance with the transition
   of IP network.  Dual-stack is the basic transition strategy for most
   data centers, as well as IP transport network.  However, in our
   practices, we found that dual-stack alone is not enough to meet the
   transition demand of ICPs(in short, ICP) in data centers.  The reason
   behind this is that providing IPv6 services requires the service
   software of ICP, i.e., website system, database system, supporting
   system, etc., should be IPv6-aware and can deal with IPv6-related
   information.  Upgrading the service system to support IPv6 is
   technological-complicated and financially costly, especially for some
   small and medium-sized ICPs, which is the main reason that the IPv6
   transition on the ICP sides moves even more slowly than the readiness
   of operators' IP network.  The lack of IPv6-reachable contents
   becomes one of the main obstacles.  On the other hand, some
   progressive ICPs who are willing to setup an IPv6-only system also
   would like to offer IPv4 continuity for end-users.

   Under such circumstances, we propose to deploy IDC transition system
   in data center, aiming at aiding CP/SP to provide IPv6 services
   rapidly and smoothly.  Another purpose of our approach is to increase
   the amount of IPv6 accessible contents for users from IPv6 Internet.
   It can also keep the IPv4 continuity for IPv6-only contents.

   This document describes our current experiences on two deployment
   models for the transition of data center based on the approaches
   specified by IETF (e.g., NAT64 [RFC6146], Dual-Stack [RFC4213],
   IVI[RFC6219], etc.), targeting different use cases or conditions.
   Based on these models, an IDC transition system was designed and
   developed by China Telecom to provide transition services to ICPs in
   data centers.  Some issues and considerations were also identified
   from the actual deployment.

3.  Motivations

   As mentioned above, IDC's transition is closely related to the IPv6
   service provisioning of ICPs.  There have been statements from
   several popular ICPs that they have turned on IPv6 (no matter by
   which means), which do have a beneficial effect on encouraging end
   users' transition to IPv6.  However, given the operational cost, it
   is still difficult for most ICPs (especially the great many ones of
   small-to- medium size) to immediately make their publically-facing
   services accessible through both IPv4 and IPv6 natively.  It will
   involve a lot of workload for upgrading numerous application systems
   and the supporting systems in ICPs.  On the other hand, from the
   users' perspective, the IPv6 reachability of resources required for
   their daily lives is one of the foremost concerns when making the
   decision on whether or not to access Internet using IPv6.  It is a
   chicken or egg dilemma, but the two perspectives are interdependent.
   If the transition of one side passes the point of inflexion, the
   other side will be speeded up after.  So, more efforts are needed to
   encourage the IPv6 adoption and reach the point.

   Moreover, some progressive ICPs are willing to maintain a separated
   IPv6-only system, which will lower the risk of the potential impact
   on their existing wildly used IPv4 system in the early phase.
   Besides, single-stack system is also easy for operation, management
   and troubleshooting.  There are no duplicated policies need to be
   applied, including e.g.  ACL control, accounting, authentication,
   etc.  In this case, it is also the requirement to offer IPv4
   continuity to IPv6-only contents.

   Therefore, the transition system provided by operators in data
   centers will not only help promote ICP transition in a step-by-step
   way, but also break out the chicken or egg dilemma for the whole IPv6
   industry.

3.1.  Transition As A Service

   In China Telecom, we have deployed a transition platform in our IDC
   network.  It can be regarded as transition services offered by the
   operators, to small-to-medium size ICPs (e.g., those who rent servers
   from the operators).

   The ICPs can choose to take different approaches according to their
   scenarios and business strategies.  For the conservative ones, the
   IPv4 services can be still offered natively, and the IPv6 services
   can be offered by the stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation [RFC6146].
   While for progressive ones and newly incomers, the stateless IVI
   [RFC6219], [RFC6052] can be employed to offer native IPv6 services
   reachable via IPv4.

3.2.  Guiding the traffic to IPv6 network

   IPv4 address shortage has driven some network providers began to run
   IPv6 in part or the whole network.  However, even if IPv6 is ready in
   the IP network, most ICPs in IDC have not been ready to provide IPv6
   services.  As a result, almost all the traffic is still IPv4-based,
   which makes the IPv6 network nearly empty.  With this in mind, IPv4/
   IPv6 translation system deployed in IDC can translate the IPv4
   packets sourced from the existing servers into IPv6 packets, and
   forward them into IPv6 network, which is equal to move the traffic
   from IPv4 network to IPv6 network. and encourage the customers to use
   IPv6 from the beginning.  Furthermore, only translation will be
   performed on the edge of the network and it is independent of user-
   side transition mechanisms.


4.  Deployment practice one: Communication from IPv6 users to IPv4
    server

4.1.  Deployment scenario

   We have deployed transition service gateway in the exit of our IDCs.
   It is a shared platform which can serve multiple servers
   simultaneously.  It can be integrated with existing network element
   of our IDC, e.g. egress router, load balancer, etc., or can be
   deployed as a new standalone device.  The integrated deployment
   scenario would have little impact on existing network topology;
   however, it is highly coupled with existing devices.  The standalone
   deployment scenario would be easier to implement on existing network
   incrementally.  However, it will result in extra cost for new
   devices.

   The egress router of our IDC is IPv6-reachable, however, either the
   content servers or the whole IDC infrastructure have been upgraded to
   IPv6 directly.  With the help of transition gateway, we can provide
   IPv6 reachable content to customers in a quick manner.  Our
   deployment model is depicted in the following picture.

   Figure 1: Deployment Model 1

   In this deployment model, the Stateful NAT64 is performed to
   translate IPv6 packets to IPv4 and vice versa.  The guidance in
   [RFC6146] should be followed.  The communications are initiated from
   the IPv6 side.  When an IPv6 packet arrives, a lookup of the mapping
   table will be carried out to get the IPv4 address used for the
   translation.  If there is no one matched, a new entry will be
   created.

   The server-side deployment model is independent of user-side
   transition When a dual-stack user gets both A and AAAA records for a
   remote server, it will be encouraged to reach IPv4 content via IPv6
   connectivity through the only NAT64 gateway along the path.  So even
   if there are some other CGNs deployed in the customer-side, IPv6
   traffic will be forwarded in a traditional way.  Therefore, there
   will be no double-translation problems around here.

   Up to now, there are 8 sites including the official website of China
   Telecom have been upgrading to IPv6 with this mechanism.  More than
   15 thousands different IPv6 users ever accessing the above eight ICPs
   through the transition box totally, with 4000 to 6000 active users
   every day. www.voc.com.cn is the most popular one accessed by more
   than 4000 IPv6 users daily, and www.chinatelecom.com.cn (the official
   website of china telecom) has amounts of access from 1200 IPv6 users
   on average every day.

4.2.  Mapping and Addressing

   The Stateful NAT64 can support the following two mapping modes:

   o  1:1, one IPv6 address is mapped to one IPv4 address (exclusively
      for given lifetime);

   o  N:1, each of the IPv4 addresses (i.e.  IPv4 address pool) will be
      shared by multiple IPv6 users from Internet.

   To save global IPv4 addresses which has become scarce resource,
   private blocks, for instance 10.0.0.0/8 may be used for the Stateful
   NAT64.  This private address block can only be seen within the IDC
   network.

   Considering the scale of traffic in the foreseeable future, the 1:1
   Mapping Mode with private blocks (one IPv6 address mapped to one
   private IPv4 address within 10.0.0.0/8) is selected as the default mode
   for the Stateful NAT64.  In this mode, there is only address-layer
   mapping and no TCP/UDP session maintenance anymore.  By this mean,
   the efficiency of stateful operations could be improved and the



Xie, et al.            Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition                March 2012


   problems introduced by the address sharing could be alleviated (for
   example, the burden of logging will be reduced in this mode).

   However, there may be conflicts if the same private space is used
   internally for the interconnection of servers (e.g. multiple servers
   for load balancing).  In this case, N:1 mode with public blocks can
   be used.  In order to reduce state management burden in N:1 stateful
   NAT64 gateway as well as logging system, a bulk of ports can be
   allocated for each subscriber.  In this port-set based mapping mode,
   one IPv6 address will be mapped to the same IPv4 address and a given
   port-set.

   In addition, an IPv6 prefix is used to serve the IPv4 servers in the
   IDC, and the route of the prefix has been advertised to the IPv6
   Internet.  The IPv4 address of the server can be embedded in the IPv6
   prefix following the algorithm specified in [RFC6052].

4.3.  DNS

   To make sure the addresses of servers can be retrieved by IPv6 users
   before initiating sessions, the AAAA records which formed through
   IPv4-translated addresses have been added directly on the domain's
   authoritative DNS, or upgrade authoritative DNS to support DNS64.  In
   this way, the AAAA records under one domain name could be retrieved
   by IPv6 users around the world.

   Please note that if the authoritative DNS of given ICPs' domain names
   are maintained by some third-party DNS Providers but not by
   themselves or the operator from whom this transition service (i.e.
   the deployment model of Stateful NAT64 discussed herein) is
   purchased, the ICPs must make sure the authoritative AAAA records can
   be added.

4.4.  Fragmentation

   Basically, the processing of packets carrying fragments follows the
   guidance specified in [RFC6145] and [RFC6146] with exceptions that
   fragmented IPv4/IPv6 packets will be firstly reassembled to an
   integrated packet before doing packet translation and so on.

4.5.  Logging

   The logging is essential for tracing back specific users in stateful
   NAT64.  In 1:1 mode, only per-user logging events need to be recorded
   as {IPv6 address, IPv4 address, timestamp}.  For N:1 mode, in order
   to reduce the number of sessions need to be logged, we adopt port-set
   based mechanism to assign a bulk of ports to each subscriber.
   Therefore, one subscriber will only create one corresponding log

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition                March 2012


   report, e.g. {IPv4 address, IPv6 address, port-set, timestamp}.

4.6.  Geographically aware services

   Since converted IPv4 address would not represent any geographical
   feature anymore, applications that assume such geographic information
   may not work as intended.

   Two solutions were designed and implemented, one is to maintain the
   above logging information in geographic server as well, and offer an
   open API to ICPs to retrieve its original IPv6 address when
   necessary.  It will have little impact on NAT64 gateway since there
   is no application-layer procedure.  However, due to the transmission
   and computational latency in geographic servers, it is more suitable
   for ICPs to retrieve IPv6 users' source address offline.  Another way
   is to embed user's source IPv6 address in x-forward field of user's
   request when it traverses NAT64 gateway.  This involves application-
   layer process which will bring extra burden on NAT64 gateway.  So
   only for ICPs who really need online users' source address will be
   offered with this additional service.

4.7.  ALG issues

   Since the types of applications are relatively limited due to the
   deployment policy, it would be easier to solve the ALG issue compared
   to client-side deployment.  For example, Web-based ICPs might be
   introduced in the first stage, and so specific ALGs can be applied
   accordingly.

   Since video traffic constitutes a great portion of the whole Internet
   traffic, we have implemented HTTP AGLs for video traffic in
   particular.

   In our test for TOP100 Websites in China, there are basically three
   types of HTTP ALGs for video traffic.

      HTTP/1.1 302 Found: This is a common way of performing a
      redirection.  Usually, IPv4 address literals for redirected server
      will be embedded in Location header.

      HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently: This is also a redirect way
      indicating the requested resource has been assigned a new
      permanent place, and the IPv4 address literals for redirected
      server will also be embedded in Location header.

      HTTP/1.1 200 ok: This code means the request has succeeded.
      However, some ICPs will still embed the IPv4 address literals to
      indicate the redirected server in the following communication, and



Xie, et al.            Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition                March 2012


      they will use a great variety of keywords.  For example,
      www.sina.com.cn uses the keyword "CDATA[http://" followed by a
      list of IPv4 addresses, and v.6.cn use "watchip" as its keyword.

   Since the first two types occupy the great majority of existing ALGs
   for HTTP-based videos traffic, we have implemented the ALG for the
   first two cases to synchronize an IPv4-translated address if the
   server of the embedded IPv4 address is located within the NAT64
   region.

4.8.  High Availability

   In general, there are two mechanisms to achieve high reliability,
   i.e. cold-standby and hot-standby.  In cold-standby mode, the NAT64
   states are not replicated from the Primary NAT64 gateway to the
   Backup NAT64 gateway.  When the Primary NAT64 gateway fails, all the
   existing established sessions will be flushed out.  The hosts are
   required to re-establish sessions with the external hosts.  Another
   high availability option is the hot standby mode.  In this mode the
   NAT64 gateway keeps established sessions while failover happens.  The
   1:1 mapping mode will greatly reduce the amount of sessions needed to
   be replicated on-the-fly from the Primary NAT64 gateway to the Backup
   gateway.  Another option is to deploy an Anycast NAT64 prefix.  This
   is similar to cold-standby that NAT64 states are not replicated
   between Primary gateway and Backup gateway, except that the heartbeat
   line is not needed anymore.

4.9.  Security

   The security issues and considerations discussed in [RFC6146] apply
   to the deployment model described in this document.  However, when
   deploying stateful NAT64 in server side, it is hard to apply source-
   based filtering policy.  As a result, we have introduced alarming
   mechanism to report the current status of state-consuming speed in
   NAT64 gateway.

   Besides, both 1:1 mapping mode and port-set based N:1 mapping mode
   can guarantee that one IPv6 source address will be mapped to a single
   IPv4 address.  Therefore, the ICP can identify a single subscriber
   either by IPv4 source address in 1:1 mapping, or IPv4 source address
   plus port-set in N:1 mapping.

4.10.  Deployment practices

   Up to now, there are 8 sites including the official website of China
   Telecom have been upgrading to IPv6 with this mechanism.  More than15
   thousands different IPv6 users ever accessing the above eight Content
   Providers through the transition box totally, with 4000 to 6000

   active users every day. www.voc.com.cn is the most popular one
   accessed by more than 4000 IPv6 users daily, and
   www.chinatelecom.com.cn (the official website of china telecom) has
   amounts of access from 1200 IPv6 users on average every day.


5.  Deployment practice two: communications from IPv4 users to IPv6
    server

5.1.  Deployment scenario

   Considering in the foreseeable future, IPv6 will be a widely accepted
   protocol in the Internet, some ICPs, especially newcomers, will setup
   IPv6-only servers, to reduce the operation and maintenance
   complexity.  When the server in question itself is IPv6-
   capable,communications initiated from IPv6 users will not encounter
   any transition problem.  What we are concerned is the communications
   initiated from IPv4 users.  To mitigate this problem, IPv4/IPv6
   translation is utilized in the IDC that the server resides.  In this
   scenario, the IPv4 node will firstly get A/AAAA records of the server
   from DNS, and then the communication will follow the path to NAT64
   Gateway.  When an IPv4 packet arrives at NAT64 Gateway, it would be
   translated to an IPv6 packet based on stateless 1:1 mapping algorithm
   [RFC6219].

5.2.  Mapping and Addressing

   To eliminate the state management burden, we adopted stateless
   transition gateway to do the Interworking between IPv4 Internet and
   IPv6-only server within IDC, IPv6-only server should be configured
   with an IPv4-translatable address.  Then both source address and
   destination address are applied with 1:1 mapping to keep the
   simplicity and transparency.

   In addition, an IPv4 address within the range of a given IPv4 prefix
   is used to represent the IPv6 server, and the route of the IPv4



Xie, et al.            Expires September 13, 2012              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition                March 2012


   prefix has been advertised to the IPv4 Internet.  An IPv6 prefix will
   be assigned to the IDC to represent the whole IPv4 Internet, when
   IPv4 packet traverse the transition gateway, IPv6 addresses, e.g.,
   source address and destination address, will be formed by combine the
   IPv4 address with a IPv6 prefix following the algorithm specified in
   [RFC6052].  In this way, the server can be reachable from IPv4
   Internet without mapping states in transition gateway.

5.3.  DNS

   To make sure that addresses of servers can be retrieved by IPv4 users
   before initiating sessions, the A records which are extracted from
   IPv4-translated addresses should be added directly on the domain's
   authoritative DNS, or upgrade authoritative DNS to support DNS64.
   Other considerations are actually the same with Section 4.

5.4.  Logging

   There is no logging issue in stateless transition solution.

5.5.  Geographically aware services

   When a ICP gets an IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses with a pre-defined
   Prefix, it should extract the embedded IPv4 address which would
   reflects its original geographical information.

5.6.  ALG issues

   ALG issues would be the same with section 4.6.

5.7.  High Availability

   Since there is no state maintained in the transition gateway, state
   replication or re-establishment encountered in the HA of the first
   deployment model will not exist in the second one.

5.8.  Security

   IPv4/IPv6 translators which can be modeled as special routers, are
   subject to the same risks, and can implement the same mitigations.
   (The discussion of generic threats to routers and their mitigations
   is beyond the scope of this document.)  There is, however, a
   particular risk that often happens in IPv4 Internet: address
   spoofing.

   An attacker could use a faked IPv4 address as the source address of
   malicious packets.  After translation, the packets will appear as
   IPv6 packets from the specified source, and the attacker may be hard

   to track.  If left without mitigation, the attack would allow
   malicious IPv4 nodes to spoof arbitrary IPv4 addresses.

   The mitigation is to implement reverse path checks and to verify
   throughout the network that packets are coming from an authorized
   location.

5.9.  Deployment practices

   The following IPv6-only websites has been setup to provide native
   IPV6 service to IPv6 users, all of them are hosted in a dual-stack
   IDC.

      http://iptv.bupt.edu.cn

      http://www.mayan.cn

      http://www.ivi.buptnet.edu.cn

   In order to accommodate the access of great volume of existing IPv4-
   only users, stateless transition gateway was deployed to provide
   translation in the exit of the IDC.  Currently, the peak of the
   traffic is around 900Mbps.
