                 Using PCP to Reveal a Host behind NAT
                   draft-boucadair-pcp-nat-reveal-01

Abstract

   This document describes how to use PCP to retrieve the identity of a
   host behind a NAT.  Two use cases are discussed and the PCP
   applicability is analyzed.  This document extends PCP with a new
   OpCode called QUERY Opcode.

   The proposed mechanism is valid for all NAT flavors including NAT44,
   NAT64 or NPTv6.

1.  Introduction

   As reported in [RFC6269], several issues are encountered when an IP
   address is shared among several subscribers.  These issues are
   encountered in various deployment contexts: e.g., Carrier Grade NAT
   (CGN), application proxies or A+P [RFC6346].

   This document extends Port Control Protocol [RFC6887] to identify a
   host among those sharing the same IP address in certain scenarios.

   The proposed technique can be used independently or combined with the
   host identifier, denoted as HOST_ID defined in
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis].

   Additional scenarios requiring host identification are listed in
   [I-D.boucadair-intarea-host-identifier-scenarios].

   The main involved functional elements are:

   o  UE (User Equipment) is a mobile node.

   o  Policy and Charging Rule Function (PCRF) which is responsible for
      determining which policy and charging control rules are to be
      applied [TS.23203].

   o  Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) which performs
      policy enforcement (e.g., Quality of Service (QoS)) and flow-based
      charging [TS.23203].

   o  Application Function (AF) is an element offering applications that
      require dynamic policy and/or charging control [TS.23203].

   o  Access Network Gateway (ANG), Base Station (BS) and Border Router
      (BR) are defined in [RFC6342].

   Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 explain the encountered problems to
   identify individual UEs when a NAT is involved in the data path.  The
   use of PCP to solve those problems is analyzed in Section 4.

3.2.  NAT between the PCEF and AF

   Figure 2 shows a scenario where a NAT function is located between the
   PCEF and AF.

                     Figure 2: NAT between PCEF and AF

   The main issue in this case is that PCEF, PCRF and AF all receive
   information bound to the same UE but cannot correlate between the
   piece of data visible for each entity.  Concretely,

   o  PCEF is aware of the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber
      Identity) and an internal IP address assigned to the UE.

   o  AF receives an external IP address and port as assigned by the NAT
      function.

   o  PCRF is not able to correlate between the external IP address/port
      assigned by the NAT and the internal IP address and IMSI of the
      UE.  For instance, the offered QoS on internal IPv4 address and
      the (shared) external IPv4 address may need to be correlated for
      accounting purposes.

   o  The IP address seen by the AF is shared among multiple UEs using
      NAT, the PCRF needs to be able to inspect the NAT binding to
      disambiguate among the individual UEs.  AF will not be able to
      treat UE traffic based on policy provided by PCRF.

3.3.  NAT before PCEF

   Figure 4 shows an alternative scenario in which a NAT function is
   located before PCEF.  The main issue is that PCEF and AF are only
   aware of the external IP address and the external port number
   assigned by the NAT function.  PCEF/AF will fail to identify each UE
   behind NAT since multiple UEs share the same external IP address and
   thus are unable to treat incoming connections differently.

4.  PCP Applicability

   This section discusses how PCP can be used to solve the problems
   described in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3.

4.1.  NAT between the PCEF and AF

   A solution to solve the problem discussed in Section 3.2 is to enable
   a PCP Server to control the NAT and enable a PCP Client in the PCRF
   (see Figure 6).

   o  The PCP server controlling the NAT is configured to accept PCP
      requests with THIRD_PARTY Option from authorized PCP clients
      (i.e., PCRF).

   o  PCRF is configured with the IP address of the PCP Server.

   o  The PCRF is aware of the following 5-tuple of each flow {Internal
      IP address of UE, Internal Port, Protocol, Remote Peer IP address,
      Remote Port number} learnt from PCEF.  PCRF is also aware of the
      following 5-tuple of each flow {External IP address, External
      Port, Protocol, Remote Peer IP address, Remote Port number} learnt
      from AF.

   o  The PCRF generates PCP PEER request with THIRD_PARTY option which
      has Internal IP Address set to the UE's Internal IP address
      provided by the PCEF.

      *  The Internal Port, Protocol, Remote Peer Port, Remote Peer IP
         Address fields of the PEER request are set by the PCRF
         according to the 5-tuple flow information provided by PCEF.

      *  Suggested External Port and Suggested External IP Address are
         set to zero.

      *  Requested Lifetime field is set to a very low value (see
         Section 12.3 of [RFC6887]).

   o  Upon the receipt of the PEER response, the PCRF compares the
      External IP Address and Port learnt with the 5-tuple flow
      information provided by the AF to correlate external IP address/
      port associated with the mapping and the internal IP address/port
      of the flow.

   o  PCRF notifies PCEF/AF to enforce relevant policies for the UE.

4.2.  NAT before PCEF

   A solution to solve the problem discussed in Section 3.3 is to extend
   PCP with a new OpCode called QUERY (see Section 5).

                         Figure 7: NAT before PCEF

   The updated interaction between PCRF, PCEF and AF is detailed below:

   o  The PCP server controlling the NAT is configured to accept QUERY
      requests Section 5 from authorized PCP clients such as PCRF.
      Query requests must not be received in the Internet-facing
      interface but from an internal interface (e.g., dedicated
      management interface).

   o  PCRF generates a PCP QUERY request with External IP Address,
      External Port, Remote Peer IP address, Remote Peer Port and
      Protocol fields for the flow learnt from PCEF or AF.

   o  PCRF learns the internal IP address and internal port number in
      the QUERY response.  This correlation is used by the PCRF to
      retrieve the UE's policy to be passed to the PCEF.

   Figure 8 shows an example of the use of QUERY OpCode.  In this
   example, an HTTP connection is initiated by the UA (192.0.2.1:33041)
   to an HTTP server (198.51.100.2:80).  The NAT assigns 198.51.100.1/
   23432 as external IP Address/Port.  PCRF learns Internal IP Address
   and Port associated with the NAT mapping using PCP QUERY request/
   response.

5.  QUERY OpCode

   This section defines a new PCP OpCode which can be used to query PCP-
   aware NAT to retrieve the Internal IP Address and Internal Port of a
   given mapping.

   The PCP Server MUST provide a configuration option to allow
   administrators to enable/disable QUERY OpCode.

Internet-Draft      PCP to Reveal a Host behind NAT             May 2013


   PCP QUERY request is used by an authorized third party PCP client
   that is only aware of the 5-tuple {External IP address and Port,
   Protocol, Remote Peer IP address and Port} and needs to learn the
   Internal IP address and Port associated with the NAT mapping.  The
   request MUST contain non-zero values of Protocol, External Port,
   Remote Peer Port, External IP address and Remote Peer IP address.
   The Requested Lifetime MUST be set to zero.

5.4.  Processing a QUERY Request

   This section describes the operation of a PCP server when processing
   a QUERY request.

   For EIM/EIF port-mapping NAT, the processing of the QUERY request is
   as follows:

   o  If any of the values Protocol, External Port and External IP
      address are equal to zero, the request is invalid and the PCP
      server MUST return a MALFORMED_REQUEST to the client.

   o  If Protocol, External Port and External IP address do not match
      any existing implicit dynamic mapping, then the PCP server MUST
      return NONEXIST_MAP error response (also needed in
      [I-D.boucadair-pcp-failure]).

   o  If Protocol, External Port and External IP address match an
      existing implicit dynamic mapping, then the PCP server MUST build
      a QUERY response with the Internal IP address, Internal Port and
      the lifetime associated with the mapping.

   For EDM port-mapping NAT, the processing of the QUERY request is as
   follows:

   o  If any of the values Protocol, External Port, Remote Peer Port,
      External IP address and Remote Peer IP Address are zero, the
      request is invalid and PCP server MUST return a MALFORMED_REQUEST
      to the client.

   o  If Protocol, External Port, Remote Peer Port, External IP address
      and Remote Peer IP address do not match any existing implicit
      dynamic mapping then the PCP server MUST return NONEXIST_MAP error
      response (also needed in [I-D.boucadair-pcp-failure]).

   o  If Protocol, External Port, Remote Peer Port, External IP address
      and Remote Peer IP address matches an existing implicit dynamic
      mapping then the PCP server builds a QUERY response with the
      Internal IP address, Internal Port and the lifetime associated
      with the mapping.

Internet-Draft      PCP to Reveal a Host behind NAT             May 2013


   PCP QUERY requests received on the Internet-facing interface MUST be
   silently drooped.

   In DS-Lite context [RFC6333], the Internal IP address returned in the
   QUERY response MUST be the IPv6 address of the remote tunnel endpoint
   and not the internal private IPv4 address.

5.5.  Processing a QUERY Response

   After performing common PCP response processing by the PCP Client,
   the response is further matched with a previously-sent QUERY request
   by comparing the QUERY Nonce, External IP Address, External Port and
   Protocol.  On a SUCCESS response, the PCP Client can use the Internal
   IP Address and Port in the QUERY response as needed.

6.  Applicability Scope of QUERY OpCode

   The PCP-Reveal solution is designed for needs within one single
   administrative domain (i.e., the PCP Client and PCP Server are
   managed by the same entity).  Considerations related to the
   activation of the PCP-Reveal solution in an inter-domain context is
   out of scope of this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Authors of this document request IANA to assign the following OpCode:

   o  QUERY

   The following error code is requested:

   o  NONEXIST_MAP

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [RFC6887] are to be taken into
   account.  In particular, QUERY OpCode MUST NOT be implemented or used
   unless the network on which the PCP QUERY messages are to be sent is
   fully trusted.  For example if Access Control Lists (ACLs) are
   installed on the PCP server, and the network between the PCP client
   and the PCP server, so those ACLs allow only communications from a
   trusted PCP client to the PCP server.

   QUERY OpCode may be generated by non legitimate PCP Clients; the PCP
   Server MUST enforce some policies such as rate limit QUERY messages.
   QUERY requests received from non legitimate PCP Clients are silently
   dropped.
