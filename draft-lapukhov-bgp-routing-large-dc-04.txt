           Using BGP for routing in large-scale data centers
                 draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc-04

Abstract

   Some service providers build and operate data centers that support
   over 100,000 servers.  In this document, such data centers are
   referred to as "large-scale" to differentiate them from smaller
   infrastructures.  The environments of this scale have a unique set of
   network requirements, with emphasis on operational simplicity and
   network stability.

   This document summarizes ideas and experience of many people involved
   in designing and operating large scale data centers using BGP as the
   only control-plane protocol.  The intent here is to report a proven
   and stable routing design that could be leveraged by others in the
   industry.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a practical routing design that can be used
   in large-scale data centers.  Such data centers, also known as hyper-
   scale or warehouse-scale data centers, have a unique attribute of
   supporting over a 100,000 end hosts.  In order to accommodate
   networks of such scale, operators are revisiting networking designs
   and platforms to address this need.

   This design described in this document is based upon the operational
   experience with data centers built to support online applications,
   such as Web search engines.  The primary requirement in such
   environments is operational simplicity and network stability, in
   order to allow for a small group of people to support large network
   infrastructure.

   After experimentation and extensive testing, the final design
   decision was made to use fully routed option with BGP as the control-
   plane protocol.  This is in contrast with more traditional data
   center designs, which rely heavily on extending Layer 2 domains
   across multiple network devices.  This document elaborates the
   network design requirements that led to this choice and presents
   detailed aspects of the BGP routing design.

2.  Document structure

   The remaining of this document is organized as following.  First, the
   document gives a quick overview of the more traditional data center
   network designs, and analyzes reasons that often made designers
   ignore using BGP for data center routing in the past.  Next, the
   design requirements for large scale data centers are presented and
   briefly discussed.  Following this, the document gives an overview of
   Clos network topology and its properties.  After that, the arguments
   for selecting BGP as the routing protocol for data center are
   presented.  Finally, the document discusses the design in more
   details and covers specific BGP features used for the network
   configuration, as well as analyzes some properties of the proposed
   design.

3.  Traditional data center designs

   This section provides an overview of two types of traditional data
   center designs - Layer 2 and fully routed Layer 3 topologies.

3.1.  Layer 2 designs

   In the networking industry, a common design choice for data centers
   is to use a mix of Ethernet-based Layer 2 technologies.  Network
   topologies typically look like a tree with redundant uplinks and
   three levels of hierarchy commonly named Core , Aggregation and
   Access layers (see Figure 1).  To accommodate bandwidth demands,
   every next level has higher port density and bandwidth capacity,
   moving upwards in the topology.  To keep terminology uniform, in this
   document these topology layers will be referred to as "tiers", e.g.
   Tier-1, Tier-2 and Tier-3 instead of Core, Aggregation or Access
   layers.

   IP routing is normally used only at the upper layers in the topology,
   e.g.  Tier-1 or Tier-2.  Some of the reasons for introducing such
   large (sometimes called stretched) Layer 2 domains are:

Internet-Draft    draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc         April 2013


   o  Supporting legacy applications that may require direct Layer 2
      adjacency or use non-IP protocols

   o  Seamless mobility for virtual machines, to allow the preservation
      of IP addresses when a virtual machine moves across physical hosts

   o  Simplified IP addressing - less IP subnets is required for the
      data center

   o  Application load-balancing may require direct Layer 2 reachability
      to perform certain functions such as Layer 2 Direct Server Return
      (DSR)

3.2.  Fully routed network designs

   Network designs that leverage IP routing down to the access layer
   (Tier-3) of the network have gained popularity as well.  The main
   benefit of such designs is improved network stability and
   scalability, as a result of confining L2 broadcast domains.  A common
   choice of routing protocol for data center designs would be an IGP,
   such as OSPF or ISIS.  As data centers grow in scale, and server
   count exceeds tens of thousands, such fully routed designs become
   more attractive.

   Although BGP is the de-facto standard protocol for routing on the
   Internet, having wide support from both the vendor and service
   provider communities, it is not generally deployed in data centers
   for a number of reasons:

   o  BGP is perceived as a "WAN only protocol only" and not often
      considered for enterprise or data center applications.

   o  BGP is believed to have a "much slower" routing convergence than
      traditional IGPs.

   o  BGP deployment within an Autonomous System (iBGP mesh) is assumed
      to have a dependency on the presence of an IGP, which assists with
      recursive next-hop resolution.

   o  BGP is perceived to require significant configuration overhead and
      does not support any form of neighbor auto-discovery.

   In this document we demonstrate a practical approach for using BGP as
   the single routing protocol for data center networks.

4.  Network design requirements

   This section describes and summarizes network design requirement for
   a large-scale data center.

4.1.  Traffic patterns

   The primary requirement when building an interconnection network for
   large number of servers is to accommodate application bandwidth and
   latency requirements.  Until recently it was quite common to see
   traffic flows mostly entering and leaving the data center (also known
   as north-south traffic) There were no intense highly meshed flows or
   traffic patterns between the machines within the data center.  As a
   result, traditional "tree" topologies were sufficient to accommodate
   such flows, even with high oversubscription ratios in network
   equipment.  If more bandwidth was required, it was added by "scaling
   up" the network elements, e.g.  by upgrading the switch line-cards or
   fabrics.

   In contrast, large-scale data centers often host applications that
   generate significant amount of server to server traffic, also known
   as "east-west" traffic.  Examples of such applications could be
   compute clusters such as Hadoop or live virtual machine migrations.
   Scaling up traditional tree topologies to match these bandwidth
   demands becomes either too expensive or impossible due to physical
   limitations.

4.2.  CAPEX minimization

   The cost of the network infrastructure alone (CAPEX) constitutes
   about 10-15% of total data center expenditure (see [GREENBERG2009]).
   However, the absolute cost is significant, and there is a need to
   constantly drive down the cost of networking elements themselves.
   This can be accomplished in two ways:

   o  Unifying all network elements, preferably using the same hardware
      type or even the same device.  This allows for bulk purchases with
      discounted pricing.

   o  Driving costs down using economic principles, by introducing
      multiple network equipment vendors.

   In order to allow for vendor diversity, it is important to minimize
   the software feature requirements for the network elements.
   Furthermore, this strategy provides maximum flexibility of vendor
   equipment choices while enforcing interoperability using open
   standards

4.3.  OPEX minimization




Lapukhov & Premji       Expires October 10, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc         April 2013


   Operating large scale infrastructure could be expensive, provided
   that larger amount of elements will statistically fail more often.
   Having a simpler design and operating using a limited software
   feature-set ensures that failures will mostly result from hardware
   malfunction and not software issues.

   An important aspect of OPEX minimization is reducing size of failure
   domains in the network.  Ethernet networks are known to be
   susceptible to broadcast or unicast traffic storms that have dramatic
   impact on network performance and availability.  The use of a fully
   routed design significantly reduces the size of the data-plane
   failure domains (e.g.  limits them to Tier-3 switches only).
   However, such designs also introduce the problem of distributed
   control-plane failures.  This observation calls for simpler control-
   plane protocols that are expected to have less chances of network
   meltdown.

4.4.  Traffic Engineering

   In any data center, application load-balancing is a critical function
   performed by network devices.  Traditionally, load-balancers are
   deployed as dedicated devices in the traffic forwarding path.  The
   problem arises in scaling load-balancers under growing traffic
   demand.  A preferable solution would be able to scale load-balancing
   layer horizontally, by adding more of the uniform nodes and
   distributing incoming traffic across these nodes

   In situation like this, an ideal choice would be to use network
   infrastructure itself to distribute traffic across a group of load-
   balancers.  A combination of features such as Anycast prefix
   advertisement [RFC4786] along with Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP)
   functionality could be used to accomplish this goal.  To allow for
   more granular load-distribution, it is beneficial for the network to
   support the ability to perform controlled per-hop traffic
   engineering.  For example, it is beneficial to directly control the
   ECMP next-hop set for Anycast prefixes at every level of network
   hierarchy.

5.  Requirement List

   This section summarizes the list of requirements, based on the
   discussion so far:

   o  REQ1: Select a network topology where capacity could be scaled
      "horizontally" by adding more links and network switches of the
      same type, without requiring an upgrade to the network elements
      themselves.

Internet-Draft    draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc         April 2013


   o  REQ2: Define a narrow set of software features/protocols supported
      by a multitude of networking equipment vendors.

   o  REQ3: Among the network protocols, choose the one that has a
      simpler implementation in terms of minimal programming code
      complexity.

   o  REQ4: The network routing protocol should allow for explicit
      control of the routing prefix next-hop set using built-in protocol
      mechanics.

6.  Network topology

   This section describes the most common choice for horizontally
   scalable topology in large scale data centers.

6.1.  Clos topology overview

   A common choice for a horizontally scalable topology is a folded Clos
   topology, sometimes called "fat-tree" (see, for example, [INTERCON]
   and [ALFARES2008]).  This topology features odd number of stages
   (sometimes known as dimensions) and is commonly made of the same
   uniform elements, e.g.  switches with the same port count.
   Therefore, the choice of Clos topology satisfies both REQ1 and REQ2.
   See Figure 2 below for an example of a folded 3-stage Clos topology:

                  Figure 2: 3-Stage Folded Clos topology

   In the networking industry, a topology like this is sometimes
   referred to as "Leaf and Spine" network, where "Spine" is the name
   given to the middle stage of the Clos topology (Tier-1) and "Leaf" is
   the name of input/output stage (Tier-2).  However, for uniformity, we
   will continue to refer to these layers using the "Tier-n" notation.

6.2.  Clos topology properties

   The following are some key properties of the Clos topology:

   o  Topology is fully non-blocking (or more accurately: non-
      interfering) if M >= N and oversubscribed by a factor of N/M
      otherwise.  Here M and N is the uplink and downlink port count
      respectively, for Tier-2 switch, as shown on Figure 2

   o  Implementing Clos topology requires a routing protocol supporting
      ECMP with the fan-out of M or more

   o  Every Tier-1 device has exactly one path to every end host
      (server) in this topology

   o  Traffic flowing from server to server is naturally load-balanced
      over all available paths using simple ECMP behavior

6.3.  Scaling Clos topology

   A Clos topology could be scaled either by increasing network switch
   port count or adding more stages, e.g.  moving to a 5-stage Clos, as
   illustrated on Figure 3 below:

                                  Tier1

                      Figure 3: 5-Stage Clos topology

   The topology on Figure 3 is built from switches with port count of 4
   and provides full bisection bandwidth to all connected servers.  We
   will refer to the collection of directly connected Tier-2 and Tier-3
   switches along with their attached servers as a "cluster" in this
   document.  For example, devices A, B, C, and D on Figure 3 form a
   cluster along with the servers they connect to.

   In practice, the Tier-3 level of the network (typically top of rack
   switches, or ToRs) is where oversubscription is introduced to allow
   for packaging of more servers in data center.  The main reason to
   limit oversubscription at a single layer of the network is to
   simplify application development that would otherwise need to account
   for two bandwidth pools: within the same access switch (e.g.  rack)
   and outside of the local switch.  Since oversubscription itself does
   not have any effect on the routing design, we will not be discussing
   it further in this document

6.4.  Managing the size of Clos topology tiers

   If the data-center network size is small, it is possible to reduce
   the number of devices in Tier-1 or Tier-2 of Clos topology by a
   factor of two, four or any other power of two.  To understand how
   this could be done, let's take Tier-1 as example.  Notice that every
   Tier-2 switch connects to a single group of Tier-1 switches.  Imagine
   that half of the ports on each of Tier-1 switch is not being used.
   Then, it is possible to reduce the number of Tier-1 switches by half,
   and simply map two uplinks from a Tier-2 device to the same Tier-1
   device - those uplinks were previously mapped to different Tier-1
   devices.  This technique maintains the same bisection bandwidth, but
   reduces the size of Tier-1 layer, thus saving on CAPEX.  The
   tradeoff, naturally, is reduction of maximum data-center size in
   terms of server count by half, if Tier-1 size is reduced in this
   manner.

   As a result of this transformation, Tier-2 switches will be using two
   or more parallel links to connect to each Tier-1 switch.  If one of
   these links fails, the other one will pick up all traffic of the
   failed link, possible resulting in heavy congestion and quality of
   service degradation.  To avoid this situation, the parallel links
   could be grouped in link aggregation groups (LAGs) with the
   configuration setting that takes the whole bundle down, upon a single
   link failure.  Any equivalent technique that enforces "fate sharing"
   on the parallel links could be used in place of LAGs to achieve the
   same effect.  As a result of such fate-sharing, traffic from two or
   more failed links will be re-balanced over the multitude of remaining
   paths, which is normally much higher than two, as it equals to the
   number of Tier-1 switches.

7.  Routing design

   This section discusses the motivation for choosing BGP as the routing
   protocol and BGP configuration for routing in Clos topology.

7.1.  Choosing the routing protocol

   The set of requirements discussed earlier call for a single routing
   protocol (REQ2) to reduce complexity and interdependencies.  While it
   is common to rely on an IGP in this situation, the document proposes
   the use of BGP only.  The advantages of using BGP are discussed
   below.

   o  BGP inherently has less complexity within its protocol design -
      internal data structures and state-machines are simpler when
      compared to a link-state IGP, such as OSPF.  For example, instead
      of implementing adjacency formation, adjacency maintenance and/or
      flow-control, BGP simply relies on TCP as the underlying
      transport.  This fulfills REQ1 and REQ2.

   o  BGP information flooding overhead is less when compared to link-
      state IGPs.  Indeed, since every BGP router typically re-
      calculates and propagates best-paths only, a network failure is
      masked as soon as the BGP speaker finds an alternate path, which
      often exists in highly symmetric topologies, such as Clos.  In
      contrary, the event propagation scope of a link-state IGP is
      single flooding domain, regardless of the failure type.
      Furthermore, even though this does not cause any significant
      impact on the modern routers, it is worth mentioning that all
      well-known link-state IGPs feature periodic refresh updates, while
      BGP does not expire routing state.

   o  BGP supports third-party (recursively resolved) next-hops.  This
      allows for ECMP or forwarding based on application-defined



Lapukhov & Premji       Expires October 10, 2013               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc         April 2013


      forwarding paths, by establishing an eBGP multi-hop peering
      session with the application "controller".  This satisfied REQ4
      stated above.  Some IGPs, such as OSPF, support similar
      functionality using concepts such as "Forwarding Address", but do
      not satisfy other requirement, e.g.  protocol simplicity.

   o  It is easy to lay down BGP ASN allocation scheme such that "BGP
      path hunting" is well-controlled, and complex unwanted paths are
      ignored.  See below Section 7.2 for an example of such ASN
      allocation scheme.  Such policy could not be enforced on a link-
      state IGP, and in result, under certain failure conditions, it may
      pick up unwanted lengthy paths, e.g.  traverse multiple Tier-2
      devices.

   o  Plain BGP configuration, without routing policies, is easier to
      troubleshoot for network reachability issues.  For example, it is
      straightforward to dump contents of BGP Loc-RIB and compare it to
      the router's RIB and, possibly, FIB.  Furthermore, every BGP
      neighbor has corresponding Adj-RIB-In and Adj-RIB-Out structures
      with incoming/outgoing NRLI information that could be easily
      correlated on both sides of the BGP peering session.  Thus, BGP
      fully satisfies REQ3.

7.2.  BGP configuration for Clos topology

   Clos topologies that have more than 5 stages are very uncommon due to
   the large numbers of interconnects required by such a design.
   Therefore, the examples below are made with regards to the 5 stage
   Clos topology (unfolded).

7.2.1.  BGP Autonomous System numbering layout

   The diagram below illustrates suggests BGP Autonomous System Number
   (BGP ASN) allocation scheme.  The following is a list of guidelines
   that can be used:

   o  All BGP peering sessions are external BGP (eBGP) established over
      direct point-to-point links interconnecting the network nodes.

   o  16-bit (two octet) BGP ASNs are used, since these are widely
      supported and have better vendor interoperability (e.g.  no need
      to support BGP capability negotiation).

   o  Private BGP ASNs from the range 64512-64534 are used so as to
      avoid ASN conflicts.  The private ASN stripping feature can be
      leveraged as a result (see below).

   o  A single BGP ASN is allocated to the Clos topology's middle stage
      ("Tier-1"), e.g.  ASN 64534 as shown in Figure 4

   o  Unique BGP ASN is allocated per each group of "Tier-2" switches
      (e.g.  aggregation switches).

   o  Unique BGP ASN is allocated to every Tier-3 switch (e.g.  ToR) in
      this topology.

7.2.2.  Non-unique private BGP ASN's

   The use of private BGP ASNs limits to the usable range of 1022 unique
   numbers.  Since it is very likely that the number of network switches
   could exceed this number, a workaround is required.  One approach
   would be to re-use the private ASN's assigned to the Tier-3 switches
   across different clusters.  For example, private BGP ASN's 65001,
   65002 ...  65032 could be used within every individual cluster and
   assigned to Tier-3 switches.

   To avoid route suppression due to AS PATH loop detection mechanism in
   BGP, upstream eBGP sessions on Tier-3 switches must be configured
   with the "AllowAS In" feature that allows accepting a device's own
   ASN in received route advertisements.  Introducing this feature does
   not create an opportunity for routing loops under misconfiguration
   since the AS PATH is always incremented when routes are propagated
   between topology tiers.

   Another solution to this problem would be to using four-octet
   (32-bit) BGP ASNs.  However, there are no reserved private ASN range
   in the four-octet numbering scheme although efforts are underway to
   support this, see [I-D.mitchell-idr-as-private-reservation].  This
   will also require vendors to implement specific policy features, such
   as four-octet private AS removal from AS-PATH attribute.

7.2.3.  Prefix advertisement

   A Clos topology features a large number of point-to-point links and
   associated prefixes.  Advertising all of these routes into BGP may
   create FIB overload conditions in the network devices.  There are two
   possible solutions that can help prevent such FIB overload:

   o  Do not advertise any of the point-to-point links into BGP.  Since
      eBGP peering changes the next-hop address anyways at every node,
      distant networks will automatically be reachable via the
      advertising eBGP peer

   o  Advertising point-to-point links, but summarizing them on every
      advertising device.  This requires proper address allocation, for
      example allocating a consecutive block of IP addresses per Tier-1
      and Tier-2 device to be used for point-to-point interface
      addressing.

   Server facing subnets on Tier-3 switches must be announced into BGP
   without using route aggregation on Tier-2 and Tier-1 switches.
   Summarizing subnets in a Clos topology will result in route black-
   holing under a single link failure (e.g.  between Tier-2 and Tier-3
   switch) and hence must be avoided.  The use of peer links within the
   same tier to resolve the black-holing problem by providing "bypass
   paths" is undesirable due to O(N^2) complexity of the peering mesh
   and waste of ports on the switches.  However, see the section
   Section 8 below for a method of performing route summarization in
   Clos networks and associated trade-offs.

7.2.4.  External connectivity

   A dedicated cluster (or clusters) in the Clos topology could be used
   for the purpose of connecting to the Wide Area Network (WAN) edge



Lapukhov & Premji       Expires October 10, 2013               [Page 14]

   devices, or WAN Routers.  Tier-3 switches in such a cluster would be
   replaced with WAN Routers, and eBGP peering would be used again,
   though WAN routers are likely to belong to a public ASN.

   The Tier-2 devices in such a dedicated cluster will be referred to as
   "Border Routers" in this document.  These devices have to perform a
   few special functions:

   o  Hide network topology information when advertising paths to WAN
      routers, i.e.  remove private BGP ASNs from the AS-PATH attribute.
      This is typically done to avoid BGP ASN number collisions between
      different data centers.  A BGP policy feature called "Remove
      Private AS" is commonly used to accomplish this.  This feature
      strips a contiguous sequence of private ASNs found in AS-PATH
      attribute prior to advertising the path to a neighbor.  This
      assumes that all BGP ASN's used for intra data center numbering
      are from the private ASN range.

   o  Originate a default route to the data center devices.  This is the
      only place where default route could be originated, as route
      summarization is highly undesirable for the "scale-out" topology.
      Alternatively, Border Routers may simply relay the default route
      learned from WAN routers.  Notice that advertising the default
      route from Border Routers requires that all Border Routers to be
      fully connected to the WAN Routers upstream, to provide resistance
      to a single-link failure.

7.2.5.  Route aggregation at the network edge

   It is often desirable to aggregate network reachability information,
   prior to advertising it to the WAN network.  The reason being high
   amount of IP prefixes originated from within the data center with
   fully routed network design.  For example, a network with 2000 Tier-3
   switches will have 2000 servers subnets advertised into BGP.
   However, as discussed before, the proposed network design does not
   allow for route aggregation due to the lack of peer links inside
   every tier.

   However, it is possible to lift this restriction for the Border
   Routers, by devising a different connectivity model for these
   devices.  There are two options possible:

   o  Interconnect the Border Routers using a full-mesh of physical
      links or by using additional aggregation switches, forming hub-
      and-spoke topology.  Next, build a full-mesh of iBGP sessions
      between all Border Routers to allow for sharing of specific
      network prefixes.  Notice that in this case the interconnecting
      peer links need to be appropriately sized depending on the amount



Lapukhov & Premji       Expires October 10, 2013               [Page 15]

      of traffic that is planned to be taken in case of a device or link
      failure underneath the Border Routers.

   o  Tier-1 devices may have additional physical links running toward
      the Border Routers (which are Tier-2 devices in essence).
      Specifically, if a protection from a single node/link failure is
      desired, each Tier-1 devices would have to connect to at least two
      Border Routers.  This puts additional requirements on the port
      count for Tier-1 devices and Border Routers, likely requiring the
      use of a different router model for Border Routers.

   If any of the above option is implemented, it is possible to perform
   route aggregation at the Border Routers toward the WAN network core,
   without risking routing black-hole condition under a single link
   failure.  Both of those options would result in non-uniform topology,
   as additional links have to be provisioned on some network devices.

7.3.  ECMP Considerations

   This section covers the Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) functionality for
   Clos topology and discusses a few special requirements.

7.3.1.  Basic ECMP

   ECMP is the fundamental load-sharing mechanism used by a Clos
   topology.  Effectively, every lower-tier switch will use all of its
   directly attached upper-tier devices to load-share traffic destined
   to the same IP prefix.  Number of ECMP paths between any two Tier-3
   switches in Clos topology equals to the number of the switches in the
   middle stage (Tier-1).  For example, Figure 5 illustrates the
   topology where Tier-3 device A has four paths to reach servers X and
   Y, via Tier-2 devices B and C and then Tier-1 devices 1, 2, 3, and 4
   respectively.

               Figure 5: ECMP fan-out tree from A to X and Y

   The ECMP requirement implies that the BGP implementation must support
   multi-path fan-out for up to the maximum number of devices directly
   attached at any point in the topology in upstream or downstream
   direction.  Normally, this number does not exceed half of the ports
   found on a switch in the topology.  For example, an ECMP max-path of
   32 would be required when building a Clos network using 64-port
   devices.  However, the Border Routers may need to have wider fan-out,
   to be able to connect to multitude of Tier-1 devices, if router
   summarization at Border Router level is provided as described above.
   If the device's hardware does not support wider ECMP, logical link-
   grouping (link-aggregation at layer 2) could be used to provide
   "hierarchical" ECMP (Layer 3 ECMP followed by Layer 2 ECMP) to
   compensate for fan-out limitations.  Such approach, however,
   increases the risk of flow polarization, as less entropy will be
   available to the second stage of ECMP.

   Most BGP implementations declare paths to be equal from ECMP
   perspective if they match up to and including step (e)
   Section 9.1.2.2 of [RFC4271].  In the proposed network design there
   is no underlying IGP, so all IGP costs are automatically assumed to
   be zero (or otherwise the same value across all paths).  Loop
   prevention is assumed to be handled by the BGP best-path selection
   process, specifically by comparing the AS_PATH lengths.

7.3.2.  BGP ECMP over multiple ASN

   For application load-balancing purposes it is desirable to have the
   same prefix advertised from multiple Tier-3 switches.  From the
   perspective of other devices, such a prefix would have BGP paths with
   different AS PATH attribute values, while having the same AS PATH
   attribute lengths.  Therefore, the BGP implementations must support
   load-sharing over above-mentioned paths.  This feature is sometimes
   known as "AS PATH multipath relax" and effectively allows for ECMP to
   be done across different neighboring ASNs.

7.3.3.  Weighted ECMP

   It may be desirable for the network devices to implement weighted
   ECMP, to be able to send more traffic over some paths in ECMP fan-
   out.  This could be helpful to compensate for failures in the network
   and send more traffic over paths that have more capacity.  The
   prefixes that require weighted ECMP are to be injected using remote
   BGP speaker (central agent) over an eBGP multihop or iBGP session
   (see Section 7.5 for more information on third-party route injection.
   Sigaling wise, the weight-distribution for multiple BGP paths could
   be done using the technique described in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-link-bandwidth].

7.4.  BGP convergence properties

   This section reviews routing convergence properties of BGP in the
   proposed design.  A case is made that sub-second convergence is
   achievable provided that implementation supports fast BGP peering
   session deactivation upon failure of an associated link.

7.4.1.  Fault detection timing

   BGP typically relies on an IGP to route around link/node failures
   inside an AS, and implements either a polling based or an event-
   driven mechanism to obtain updates on IGP state changes.  The
   proposed routing design does not use an IGP, so the only mechanisms
   that could be used for fault detection are BGP keep-alive process (or
   any other type of keep-alive mechanism) and link-failure triggers.

   Relying solely on BGP keep-alive packets may result in high
   convergence delays, in the order of multiple seconds (commonly, the
   minimum recommended BGP hold timer value is 3 seconds).  However,
   many BGP implementations can shut down local eBGP peering sessions in
   response to the "link down" event for the outgoing interface used for
   BGP peering.  This feature is sometimes called as "fast fail-over".
   Since the majority of the links in modern data centers are point-to-
   point fiber connections, a physical interface failure if often
   detected in milliseconds and subsequently triggers a BGP re-
   convergence.

Internet-Draft    draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc         April 2013


   Furthermore, popular link technologies, such as 10Gbps Ethernet, may
   support a simple form of OAM for failure signaling such as
   [FAULTSIG10GE], which makes failure detection more robust.
   Alternatively, as opposed to relying on physical layer for fault
   signaling, some platforms may support Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection (BFD) ([RFC5880]) to allow for sub-second failure detection
   and fault signaling to the BGP process.  This presents additional
   requirements to vendor software and possibly hardware, and may
   contradict REQ1.

7.4.2.  Event propagation timing

   Firstly, the impact of BGP Minimum Route Advertisement Interval
   (MRAI) timer (See section 9.2.1.1 of [RFC4271]) needs to be
   considered.  It is required for BGP implementations to space out
   consecutive BGP UPDATE messages by at least MRAI seconds, which is
   often a configurable value.  Notice that BGP UPDATE messages carrying
   withdrawn routes are common not affected by this timer.  The MRAI
   timer may present significant convergence delays if a BGP speaker
   "waits" for the new path to be learned from peers and has no local
   backup path information.

   However, in a Clos topology each BGP speaker has either one path only
   or N paths for the same prefix, where N is a significantly large
   number, e.g.  N=32.  Therefore, if a path fails there is either no
   backup at all, or the backup is readily available in BGP Loc-RIB.  In
   the first case, the BGP withdrawal announcement will propagate un-
   delayed and trigger re-convergence on affected devices.  In the
   second case, only the local ECMP group needs to be changed.

7.4.3.  Impact of Clos topology fan-outs

   Clos topology has large fan-outs, which may impact the "Up->Down"
   convergence in some cases, as described further.  Specifically,
   imagine a situation when a link between Tier-3 and Tier-2 device
   fails.  The Tier-2 device will send BGP WITHDRAW message to all
   upstream Tier-1 devices, and Tier-1 devices will, in turn, relay this
   message to all downstream Tier-2 devices.  Notice now, that a Tier-2
   device other than the one originating the WITHDRAW, should wait for
   ALL adjacent Tier-1 devices to send WITHDRAW message, before it
   removes the affected prefixes and sends WITHDRAW down to downstream
   Tier-3 devices.  If the original Tier-2 device or the relaying Tier-1
   devices introduce some delay into their announcements, the result
   could be WITHDRAW message "dispersion", that could be as much as
   multiple seconds.  In order to avoid such behavior, BGP
   implementation must support the so-called "UPDATE groups", where BGP
   message is built once for a group of neighbors that must receive this
   update, and then advertised synchronously to all neighbors.

Internet-Draft    draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc         April 2013


   The impact of such "dispersion" grows with the size of topology fan-
   out, and could become more noticeable under network convergence
   churn.

7.4.4.  Failure impact scope

   A network is declared to converge in response to a failure once all
   devices within the failure impact scope are notified of the event and
   have re-calculated their RIB's and consequently FIB's.  Larger
   failure impact scope normally means slower convergence, since more
   devices have to be notified, and additionally results in less stable
   network.  In this section we demonstrate that with regards to failure
   impact scope, BGP has some advantages over link-state routing
   protocols when implemented in a Clos topology.

   BGP is inherently a distance-vector protocol, and as such some of
   failures could be masked if the local node can immediately find a
   backup path.  The worst case is that ALL devices in data center
   topology would have to either withdraw a prefix completely, or update
   the ECMP groups in the FIB.  However, many failures will not result
   in such wide impact.  There are two main failure types where impact
   scope is reduced.

   o  Failure of a link between Tier-2 and Tier-1 devices.  In this
      case, Tier-2 device will simply have to update its ECMP group,
      removing the failed link.  There is no need to send new
      information to the downstream Tier-3 devices.  The affected Tier-1
      device will lose the only path available to reach a particular
      cluster and will have to withdraw the affected prefixes.  Such
      prefix withdrawal process will only affect Tier-2 switches
      directly connected to the affected Tier-1 device.  In turn, the
      Tier-2 devices receiving BGP UPDATE message withdrawing prefixes
      will simply have to update their ECMP groups for affected
      prefixes.  The Tier-3 devices will not be involved in re-
      convergence process.

   o  Failure of a Tier-1 device.  In this case, all Tier-2 devices
      directly attached to the failed node will have to update their
      ECMP groups for all IP prefixes from non-local cluster.  The
      Tier-3 devices are once again not involved in the re-convergence
      process.

   Even though it may seem that in case of such failures multiple IP
   prefixes will have to be reprogrammed in the FIB, it is worth noting
   that ALL of these prefixes share single ECMP group on Tier-2 device.
   Thus, in case of a hierarchical FIB only a single change has to be
   made to the FIB.

Internet-Draft    draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc         April 2013


   Even though BGP offers some failure scope reduction, reduction of the
   fault domain using summarization is not always possible with the
   proposed design, since using this technique may create route black-
   holing issues as mentioned previously.  Thus, the worst control-plane
   failure impact scope is the network as a whole, e.g.  in a case of a
   link failure between Tier-2 and Tier-3 switches.  However, the amount
   of affected prefixes in this case would be much less, as compared to
   a failure in the upper layers of a Clos network topology.  Finally,
   it is worth pointing that the property of having such large failure
   scope is not a result of choosing BGP, but rather a result of using
   the "scale-out" Clos topology.

7.4.5.  Routing micro-loops

   When a downstream device, e.g.  Tier-2 switch, loses a path to the
   prefix, it normally has the default route pointing toward the
   upstream device, e.g.  Tier-1 switch.  As a result, it is possible to
   get in the situation when Tier-2 loses a prefix, but Tier-1 still has
   the path: this results in transient micro-loop, since Tier-1 switch
   will keep passing packets to the affected prefix back to Tier-2
   device, and Tier-2 will bounce it once again using the default route.
   This will form a micro-loop, for the duration of time it takes the
   upstream device to fully update its forwarding tables.

   To minimize impact of the micro-loops, Tier-2 and Tier-1 switches
   should be configured with static "discard" routes that will override
   the use of default route for the duration of network convergence.
   For Tier-2 devices, such discard route should be an aggregate route,
   covering all server subnets of the underlying Tier-3 switches.  For
   Tier-1 devices, the discard route should be an aggregate covering the
   server IP address subnet allocated for the whole data-center.  Those
   discard routes will only take precedence for the duration of network
   convergence, until the device learns more specific prefix via a new
   path.

7.5.  Third-party route injection

   BGP allows for a third-party BGP speaker (not necessarily directly
   attached to the network devices) to inject routes anywhere in the
   network topology.  This could be achieved by peering an external
   speaker using an eBGP multi-hop session with some or even all devices
   in the topology.  Furthermore, BGP diverse path distribution
   [I-D.ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist] could be used to inject
   multiple next-hop for the same prefix to facilitate load-balancing,
   or using the BGP Add-Path extension (see [I-D.walton-bgp-add-paths])
   if supported by the implementation.

Internet-Draft    draft-lapukhov-bgp-routing-large-dc         April 2013


   For example, a third-party BGP speaker may peer with Tier-3 and
   Tier-1 switches, injecting the same prefix, but using a special set
   of BGP next-hops for Tier-1 devices.  Those next-hops are assumed to
   resolve recursively via BGP, and could be, for example, IP addresses
   on Tier-3 switches.  The resulting forwarding table programming could
   provide desired traffic proportion distribution among different
   clusters.

8.  Adding route aggregation to Clos topology

   As mentioned previously, route aggregation is not possible in
   "native" Clos topology, since it makes network susceptible to route
   black-holing under a single link failure.  The main problem is
   limited number of parallel paths between network elements, for
   example only a single path between any pair of Tier-1 and Tier-3
   switches.  However, some operators may find route aggregation
   desirable to improve network control plane stability.

   With this said, it is possible to change the network topology design
   and allow for route aggregation, though the trade-off would be
   reduced size of the total network, and network congestion under
   specific failures.  This approach is very similar to the techique
   described above, to allow Border Routers to summarize the data-center
   address space.

8.1.  Collapsing Tier-1 switches layer

   In order to add more paths between Tier-1 and Tier-3 switches,
   imagine that we group Tier-2 switches in pairs, and connect the pair
   to the same group of Tier-1 switches.  This is logically equivalent
   to "collapsing" Tier-1 switches into a group of half size, merging
   the links on the "collapsed" devices.  The result is illustrated on
   the figure Figure 6 below.  For example, in this topology DEV C and
   DEV D connect to the same set of Tier-1 devices (DEV 1 and DEV 2),
   whereas before there connecting to different groups of Tier-1
   devices.

                      Figure 6: 5-Stage Clos topology

   With this design, Tier-2 devices may not advertise a default route
   only down to Tier-3 devices.  If a link between Tier-2 and Tier-3
   fails, the traffic will be re-routed via the second available path
   known to Tier-2 switch.  It is still not possible to advertise a
   summary route covering prefixes for a single cluster from Tier-2
   devices, since each of them has only a single path down to this
   prefix.  It would require dual-homed servers to accomplish that.
   Also note that this design is only resilient to single link failure -
   it is possible for a double link failure to isolate Tier-2 device
   from all paths toward a select Tier-3 device, thus causing routing
   black-hole.

8.2.  Implications of the network design change

   As mentioned already, a result of proposed topology modification
   would be reduction of Tier-1 switches port capacity.  This will limit
   the maximum number of attached Tier-2 devices and, therefore, the
   maximum data-center network size.  A larger network would require
   different Tier-1 devices, with higher port count to implement this
   change.

   Another problem is traffic re-balancing under link failures.  Since
   three are two paths from Tier-1 to Tier-3, a failure of the link
   between Tier-1 and Tier-2 switch would result in all traffic that was
   taking the failed link to switch to the remaining path.  This will
   result in doubling of link utilization on the remaining link.

9.  Security Considerations

   The design does not introduce any additional security concerns.  For
   control plane security, BGP peering sessions could be authenticated
   using TCP MD5 signature extension header [RFC2385].  Furthermore, BGP
   TTL security [I-D.gill-btsh] could be used to reduce the risk of
   session spoofing and TCP SYN flooding attacks against the control
   plane.
