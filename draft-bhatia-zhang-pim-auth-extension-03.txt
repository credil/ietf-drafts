  In-Band Authentication Extension for Protocol Independent Multicast
                draft-bhatia-zhang-pim-auth-extension-03

Abstract

   Existing security mechanisms for the Protocol Independent Multicast -
   Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) routing protocol mandates the use of IPsec to
   provide message authenticity and integrity.  This draft proposes an
   embedded authentication mechanism to facilitate data origin
   authentication and integrity verification for PIM packets in the
   cases where IPsec cannot be applied.

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM          March 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5796] describes the methods of using the IP security (IPsec)
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] or the Authentication
   Header (AH) [RFC4302] (which is optional) to protect the authenticity
   and integrity of the link-local messages of Protocol Independent
   Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)[RFC4601].  [RFC5796] mandates the
   application of manual key management mechanisms and provide optional
   support for an automated group key management mechanism.  However,
   the procedures for implementing automated group key management are
   not specified.

   It has been clarified in [I-D.bhatia-karp-pim-gap-analysis] that
   without the support of automated group key management mechanisms, the
   PIM packets protected by IPsec will be vulnerable to both inter-
   session and inner-session replay attacks.  In addition, the poor
   scalability of manual keying may cause deployment issues in many
   typical scenarios.  This document proposes few changes in the PIM
   header which helps in carrying authentication data along with the
   usual PIM packet.  The PIM packet contains all the essential
   inforamtion for data origin authentication and message integrity
   verification without the support of IPsec.

   In this solution, it is assumed that manual keying is performed while
   the automatic key management mechanisms are not precluded.  A
   strictly increasing sequence number is adopted to address the replay
   attack issues.  However, the work of addressing the scalability
   issues imposed by manual keying is out of scope of this draft.


2.  Proposed Solution

   This document adds some more fields in PIM packet to carry the
   authentication information.  Figure 1 illustrates the format of a PIM
   packet that carries authentication information.

   Figure 1.  Format of a PIM packet carrying authentication information

      PIM Ver: PIM Version number is 2.

      Type: Types for specific PIM messages.  PIM types are defined in
      [RFC4601].

      Auth bit: If 'Auth' bit is 1, it means the PIM packet is carrying
      authentication information.  If 'Auth' bit is 0, it means the PIM
      packet is not carrying authentication information and such a
      packet should be handled as specified in [RFC4601].

      Reserved: Set to zero on transmission.  Ignored upon receipt.

      PIM Message Length: A 16-bit field that contains the length of the
      PIM message.  This length does not include the length of the PIM
      header, PIM auth header and authentication data.

      Key ID: A 16-bit field that identifies the secret key and the
      algorithm used to create the authentication data.

      Auth Data Len: A 16-bit field that identifies the length of the
      trailing authentication data field.

      Cryptographic Sequence Number: A 64-bit strictly increasing
      sequence number that is used to guard against replay attacks.  The
      64-bit sequence number MUST be incremented for every PIM packet
      carrying authentication.  Upon reception, the sequence number MUST



Bhatia, et al.         Expires September 29, 2013               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM          March 2013


      be greater than the sequence number in the last PIM packet
      accepted from the PIM router sending the packet.  Otherwise, the
      PIM packet is considered a replayed packet and dropped.  PIM
      routers implementing this specification SHOULD use available
      mechanisms to preserve the sequence number's strictly increasing
      property for the deployed life of the PIM router (including cold
      restarts).  Techniques such as sequence number space partitioning
      and non-volatile storage preservation can be used but are beyond
      the scope of this specification.

      PIM Message: PIM message as specified in [RFC4601].

      Authentication Data: Variable length authentication data.  This
      field carries the digest for the protocol packet.

   A PIM packet carrying authentication information does not need
   checksum for integrity check.  So 'checksum' field has been replaced
   with 'PIM Message Length' in a PIM packet carrying authentication
   information.


3.  PIM Security Association

   A PIM Security Association (SA) consists of a set of parameters for
   PIM routers to correctly generate or verify PIM packets carrying
   authentication information.  In manual keying, it is the
   responsibility of network operators to generate and deploy PIM SAs
   amongst PIM routers appropriately to ensure the routers can exchange
   PIM messages.

   The parameters associated with a PIM SA:

   o  Key Identifier (Key ID) : A 16-bit unsigned integer which is used
      to uniquely identify a PIM SA within a PIM domain.

   o  Authentication Algorithm: This parameter is used to indicate
      authentication algorithm to be used with the PIM SA.  The value of
      this parameter can be implementation specific.  The following
      algorithms SHOULD be supported: HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-
      SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512.

   o  Key: The value of this parameter denotes the cryptographic key
      associated with the key ID.  The length of this key is determined
      by the algorithm specified in the PIM SA.

   o  Key Start Accept: The time after which a PIM router will accept a
      packet if it is created with this PIM SA.

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM          March 2013


   o  Key Start Generate: The time after which a PIM router will begin
      using this PIM SA for PIM packet generation.

   o  Key Stop Generate: The time after which a PIM router will stop
      using this PIM SA for PIM packet generation.

   o  Key Stop Accept: The time after which a PIM router will refuse to
      accept a packet if it is generated with this PIM SA.


4.  PIM Packet Processing

4.1.  Cryptographic Aspects

   In the algorithm description below, the following nomenclature, which
   is consistent with [FIPS-198], is used:

   H is the specific hashing algorithm (e.g.  SHA-256).

   K is the Authentication Key for the PIM security association.

   Ko is the cryptographic key used with the hash algorithm.

   B is the block size of H, measured in octets rather than bits.

   Note that B is the internal block size, not the hash size.

   For SHA-1 and SHA-256: B == 64

   For SHA-384 and SHA-512: B == 128

   L is the length of the hash, measured in octets rather than bits.

   XOR is the exclusive-or operation.

   Opad is the hexadecimal value 0x5c repeated B times.

   Ipad is the hexadecimal value 0x36 repeated B times.

   Apad is a value which is the same length as the hash output or
   message digest.  If the packet is transported upon IPv6, the first 16
   octets contain the IPv6 source address followed by the hexadecimal
   value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L-16)/4 times.  If the packet is
   transported upon IPv4, the first 4 octets contain the IPv4 source
   address followed by the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L-4)/4
   times.

   1.  Preparation of the Key



Bhatia, et al.         Expires September 29, 2013               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM          March 2013


      In this application, Ko is always L octets long.

      If the Authentication Key (K) is L octets long, then Ko is equal
      to K. If the Authentication Key (K) is more than L octets long,
      then Ko is set to H(K).  If the Authentication Key (K) is less
      than L octets long, then Ko is set to the Authentication Key (K)
      with zeros appended to the end of the Authentication Key (K) such
      that Ko is L octets long.

   2.  First Hash

      First, the PIM packet's Authentication Data field is filled with
      the value Apad.

      Then, a First-Hash, also known as the inner hash, is computed as
      follows:

      If the PIM packet is a Register packet

      First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (PIM Packet - Data Part))

      else

      First-Hash = H(Ko XOR Ipad || (PIM Packet))

      The digest length for SHA-1 is 20 octets; for SHA-256, 32 octets;
      for SHA-384, 48 octets; and for SHA-512, 64 octets.

   3.  Second Hash

      Then a second hash, also known as the outer hash, is computed as
      follows:

      Second-Hash = H(Ko XOR Opad || First-Hash)

   4.  Result

      The resulting Second-Hash becomes the authentication data that is
      added in the PIM packet.  The length of the authentication data is
      always identical to the message digest size of the specific hash
      function H that is being used.

4.2.  Outbounding Packet Processing

   If embedded authentication is enabled, sender first finds an
   appropriate PIM security association (SA) to be used for this packet.
   Following processing is done:

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM          March 2013


   o  It first prepares the PIM header and PIM auth header as follows:

      *  PIM version is set to 2

      *  Type field is set to the PIM message type that is being sent.

      *  Auth bit is set to 1.

      *  Reserved field is set to 0.

      *  Key ID is set to the key-id from PIM SA

      *  Auth Data Len is set to the length of the Authentication Data
         field which is determined based on the algorithm specified in
         the selected SA.

      *  The sequence number for the selected SA is increased and the
         new value is inserted into the Sequence Number field.

   o  It then populates the PIM message that is to be sent out.  As
      length of the PIM message is now known, it is updated in the PIM
      header.

   o  The Authentication Data field is set to Apad and then sender
      generates the authentication data as described in Section 4.1 for
      the PIM packet.  Calculate authentication data is inserted in the
      Authentication data field.

   After this PIM packet is sent out on the idenfitied interface.

4.3.  Inbounding Packet Processing

   A router identifies a received PIM packet is carrying authentication
   data by examining the 'Auth' bit in the PIM header.  If the 'Auth'
   bit is 1, it means the PIM packet is carrying embedded authentication
   information.  Following processing is done:

   o  Find the PIM SA for the Key ID available in PIM auth header in the
      PIM packet.  If no valid PIM SA is found for this packet or the
      PIM SA is not in its valid period, receiver MUST discard the
      packet and SHOULD log an error event.

   o  If the cryptographic sequence number of the packet is less than or
      equal to the last sequence number received from the same PIM
      router, receiver MUST discard the packet and SHOULD log an error
      event.





Bhatia, et al.         Expires September 29, 2013               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Authentication Extension for PIM          March 2013


   o  Find the Auth data len expected from the PIM SA and compare it
      against the Auth Data Len in the packet.  If the two do not match,
      receiver MUST discard the packet and SHOULD log an error event.

   o  Calculate the PIM message length using total packet length from IP
      header and Auth Data Len from PIM Auth Header.  Compare it with
      the PIM message length in PIM header.  If the two do not match,
      receiver MUST discard the packet and SHOULD log an error event.

   o  Receiver stores the Authentication Data from packet locally.  It
      then fills the Authentication Data field with Apad.  Then the
      receiver calculates the authentication data for the PIM packet as
      described in Section 4.1.  The calculated authentication data is
      then compared with the received authentication data in PIM packet.
      If the two do not match, reciever MUST discard the packet and
      SHOULD log an error event.  If the two matches, PIM message is
      passed for further processing.


5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Register packet processing

   The solution proposed in this draft only intends to secure PIM
   singaling packets.  The efforts for protecting data packets
   transported among PIM routers is out of scope.  Therefore, for a
   register packet, only PIM header, PIM Auth Header, the B field and
   the N field are secured while the Multicast data packet part is not
   protected.

5.2.  Inter-Session Replay Attack Issue

   When a router is rebooted, the sequence number will be re-
   initialzed.  This will cause a problem.  When a PIM router receive a
   hello message with a changed GenID and an re-inialized sequence
   number, it is difficult for the receiver to distinguish this message
   from a replay attack.  The soltuion proposed in this document is
   subject to this problem.  However, the experience in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying] can be used to
   address this problem.  In the solution proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying], there is a reboot
   counter maintained in non-volatile memory which is increased by 1
   after every reboot.  The reboot count value is set into the first 32
   bits of the sequence number.  Therefore, even after a restart, the
   sequence number will still be increased.
