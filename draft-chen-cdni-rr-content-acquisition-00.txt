Internet-Draft   Request Routing and Content Acquisition       June 2012


1.  Introduction

   The scope of CDNi work is described in [I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-
   statement]:

   - As illustrated in Figure 1, the acquisition of content between
   interconnected CDNs is out of scope for CDNI, which deserves some
   additional explanation.  The consequence of such a decision is that
   the CDNI problem space described in this document is focused on only
   defining the control plane for CDNI; and the CDNI data plane (i.e.,
   the acquisition and distribution of the actual content objects) is
   out of scope.

   It can be implied that the delivery process of the actual content
   object requested by the end user from uCDN to dCDN is outside the
   scope of CDNi work.  However, in the cache miss case, i.e., the dCDN
   receives end user's request redirected by the uCDN and does not find
   the corresponding content in the cache, the dCDN needs to determine
   toward which uCDN it should initiate the content acquisition
   procedure.  And this should be covered within CDNi's scope.

   This document illustrates the mechanism of request routing and
   content acquisition between uCDN and dCDN on the basis of Content
   Identification.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document reuses the terminology defined in:

   [I-D.draft-ietf-cdni-problem-statement-06],

   [I-D.draft-ietf-cdni-requirements-03],

   [I-D.draft-ietf-cdni-framework-00], and

   [I-D.draft-ietf-cdni-use-cases-08].


2.  Prerequisite

2.1.  CDN Interconnection Framework

   In the CDNi framework, the process of end user's content request from
   the uCDN first, and then the content delivery by the dCDN can be

   further divided into two sub-procedures: Request Routing and Content
   Acquisition.  The method used in [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] is that
   the CDN operators pre-agree for using 'distinguished' CDN-domains and
   embed them in URLs that end users request.  The example used is a
   CDN-domain peer-a.op-b.net that will be used as the target of
   redirections from uCDN to dCDN and a CDN-domain op-b-acq.op-a.net
   that will be used for inter-CDN acquisition of CSP's content from
   uCDN by dCDN.

   When the CDNi framework has even complex topology, i.e., in the case
   of cascaded CDNs, in order to record the redirection route of the
   request message, all the redirection routing information is required
   to be included in the URL, which would result in a very long URL.
   Limited by the length and format of URL, such approach would cause
   serious delay and waste of resources, and it would be difficult to
   implement this.  In addition, in the process of request message
   redirection, there is possibility that the URL is modified by a CDN
   which may lead to inaccuracy of the redirection and content
   acquisition information.

   This document introduces a content identification parameter called
   'UniContentID' to uniquely identify acontent item, the details of
   which are illustrated in Section 2.2.  This document also makes use
   of static configuration mechanism, i.e., every CDN provides a fixed
   URL or IP address for other CDN to download content from.  This fixed
   URL or IP address is valid to all CDNs and all request messages sent
   to this address is considered as content downloading request.  By
   doing this the change of request URL during multiple redirection
   processes can be avoided, and it would also accelerate the process of
   locatingcorresponding uCDN and the content item requested by the end
   user.  This method is easy to implement and can be used in cascaded
   CDNs scenario.

   Editor's Note: The mechanism for using dynamic mechanism to acquire
   the URL or IP address of uCDN for content downloading is FFS.

2.2.  UniContentID

   Given that the CDN needs to support the requirements for ingesting
   content to multi-screen for the same CMS (as described in ITU-T
   Y.1910 IPTV Functional Architecture), we need to define a two-tuple,
   i.e., the parameter of UniContentID to identify uniquely different
   CMSs.

   UniConentID is defined by a two-tuple as (ProviderID, ContentID),
   which can uniquely identify only one content item in the CDN.  Here
   the parameter ContentID denotes only one content item in a specific
   domain of a CMS.  The parameter ProviderID is defined as the provider
   for specific domain and is only for a specific CMS in a specific
   domain.  We define the configuration table in the CDN which needs to
   be used in the request routing as follows:

   * CMSID: denotes the DNS name or IP address of the CMS.

   * Domain: denotes the different mark for IPTV services, PC service
   and mobile service etc.  For example, we define 0 for IPTV service, 1
   for PC service, 2 for mobile service and 3 for reserved other
   service.

   * ProviderID: denotes the mark of specific domain content provider,
   which is singular in this configuration table.  For the same

Internet-Draft   Request Routing and Content Acquisition       June 2012


   parameter of CMSID, different parameter of Domain indicates different
   parameters of ProviderID.

   * ProviderType: denotes the provider type as B2B service or B2C
   service.  For example, we define 1 for B2B and 2 for B2C.

   * PlaybackURLprefix: denotes the prefix of the specific content
   service URL of the portal.  There is a one-to-one relationship
   between PlaybackURLpredix and ProviderID.  For example, the URL is
   http://video.netitv.com/01234567890123456789012345678900?..., then
   the PlaybackURLpredix is video.netitv.com.

   * ContentURLParseRule: denotes resolution rule for the parameter of
   URL and ContentID, which is a regular expression.



      +-------------------------------------------------------------+
      |CMS| Domain| ProviderID| Provider Type| Playback | ContentURL|

      +-------------------------------------------------------------+

      Figure 2 The Configuration Table

   Example 1: the parameter of ProviderID matched through the parameter
   of CMSID and Domain

   In the configuration table for IPTV service of specific CMS, we set
   the parameter of ProviderID is iptv.netitv.com and the parameter of
   CMSID is '10.17.45.233'.  Then one content is ingested to the CDN and
   the parameter of ContentID is '01234567890123456789012345678900'.
   Domain is '0'.  The two tuple of UniContentID is
   ('iptv.netitv.com','01234567890123456789012345678900').

   In the website portal, the URL for the content serving is 'RTSP RR
   IP:PORT/ ContentID?CMSID=XXX &Domain=XXX...'.  When the streaming
   server received the URL, it analyses the parameter of ProviderID is
   'iptv.netitv.com' through looking up the configuration table.  Then
   the two tuple UniContentID is('iptv.netitv.com',
   '01234567890123456789012345678900').  We can request the content in
   the local cache when cache hit or relay the content from the uCDN
   when the cache is not hit.

   Example 2: the parameter of ProviderID matched for mobile service

   In the configuration table for mobile service of specific CMS, we set
   the parameter of ProviderID is mobile.netitv.com and the parameter of
   PlaybackURLPrefix is 'mobile.netitv.com'.  Then one content is

   ingested to the CDN and the parameter of ContentID is
   '01234567890123456789012345678900'.  Domain is '2'.  The two tuple of
   UniContentID is ('mobile.netitv.com',
   '01234567890123456789012345678900').

   In the website portal, the URL for the content serving is 'RTSP://
   mobile.netitv.com/01234567890123456789012345678900?...'.  When the
   streaming server received the URL, it analyses the parameter of
   PlaybackURLprefix is 'mobile.netitv.com' and finds the parameter of
   ProviderID is 'mobile.netitv.com' through looking up the
   configuration table.  Then the two tuple UniContentID is
   ('mobile.netitv.com', ' 01234567890123456789012345678900').  We can
   request the content in the local cache when cache hit or relay the
   content from the uCDN when the cache is not hit.

   Example 3: ProviderID matched for PC service

   In the configuration table for mobile service of specific CMS, we set
   the ProviderID is pc.netitv.com and PlaybackURLPrefix is
   'video.netitv.com'.  Then one content is ingested to the CDN and the
   ContentID is '01234567890123456789012345678900'.  Domain is '1'.  The
   two tuple of UniContentID is ('pc.netitv.com',
   '01234567890123456789012345678900').

   In the website portal, the URL for the content serving is 'http://
   video.netitv.com/01234567890123456789012345678900?...'.  When the
   streaming server received the URL, it analyses the parameter of
   PlaybackURLprefix is 'video.netitv.com' and finds the parameter of
   ProviderID is 'pc.netitv.com' through looking up the configuration
   table.  Then the two tuple UniContentID is ('pc.netitv.com', '
   01234567890123456789012345678900').  We can request the content in
   the local cache when cache hit or relay the content from the uCDN
   when the cache is not hit.

           Figure 3 Message Exchange for Request Routing

   1.  A Request Router of uCDN processes the RTSP or HTTP request and
   recognizes that the end-user is best served by another CDN.  It
   returns the IP address of dCDN.

   2. uCDN returns a 302 redirection message for a new URL including the
   IP address of dCDN.

   3.  The end-user then sends the request to the Request Router of dCDN
   (i.e. dCDN RR). dCDN RR returns the IP address of corresponding
   delivery node.

   4. dCDN RR returns a new URL including the IP address of dCDN DN.
   Note that, since the name of the delivery node was already obtained
   from dCDN (i.e. dCDN DN), there should not be any further redirection
   here.

   5.  The end-user requests the content from dCDN's delivery
   node,potentially resulting in a cache miss.  In the case of cache
   miss, the content needs to be acquired from uCDN (not the CSP), which
   is described in the following section.

         Figure 4 Message Exchange for Content Acquisition

   1.  The request router of dCDN processes the request from the end-
   user and forwards the request to the request router of mCDN.  Note
   that the dCDN needs to obtain the ProviderID information by looking
   up the configuration table.  The ProviderID and ContentID information
   can identify a unique content.

   2.  The request router of mCDN finds a cache miss case in the
   delivery nodes of mCDN.  It forwards the request to the request
   router of uCDN for the content.

   3.  The request router of uCDN finds that the content is cached in
   the delivery node of uCDN, then the delivery node of uCDN delivers
   the content to the delivery node of mCDN.

   4.  The delivery node of mCDN delivers the content to the delivery
   node of dCDN.

   5.  The delivery node of dCDN delivers the content to the end-user.

   Note: The content acquisition interface in step 3~5 needs to be
   standardized.
