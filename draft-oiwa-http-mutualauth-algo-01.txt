1.  Introduction

   This document specifies some algorithms for Mutual authentication
   protocol for Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (HTTP)
   [I-D.oiwa-http-mutualauth].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The terms "encouraged" and "advised" are used for suggestions that do
   not constitute "SHOULD"-level requirements.  People MAY freely choose
   not to include the suggested items regarding [RFC2119], but complying
   with those suggestions would be a best practice; it will improve the
   security, interoperability, and/or operational performance.

   The term "natural numbers" refers to the non-negative integers
   (including zero) throughout this document.

   This document treats target (codomain) of hash functions to be
   natural numbers.  The notation OCTETS(H(s)) gives a usual octet-
   string output of hash function H applied to string s.


2.  Authentication Algorithms

   This document specifies only one family of the authentication
   algorithm.  The family consists of four authentication algorithms,
   which only differ in their underlying mathematical groups and
   security parameters.  The algorithms do not add any additional
   fields.  The tokens for these algorithms are

   o  iso-kam3-dl-2048-sha256: for the 2048-bit discrete-logarithm
      setting with the SHA-256 hash function.

   o  iso-kam3-dl-4096-sha512: for the 4096-bit discrete-logarithm
      setting with the SHA-512 hash function.

   o  iso-kam3-ec-p256-sha256: for the 256-bit prime-field elliptic-
      curve setting with the SHA-256 hash function.

   o  iso-kam3-ec-p521-sha512: for the 521-bit prime-field elliptic-
      curve setting with the SHA-512 hash function.

   For discrete-logarithm settings, the underlying groups are the 2048-

   bit and 4096-bit MODP groups defined in [RFC3526], respectively.  See
   Appendix A for the exact specifications of the groups and associated
   parameters.  The hash functions H are SHA-256 for the 2048-bit group
   and SHA-512 for the 4096-bit group, respectively, defined in FIPS PUB
   180-2 [FIPS.180-2.2002].  The representation of the parameters kc1,
   ks1, vkc, and vks is base64-fixed-number.

   For the elliptic-curve settings, the underlying groups are the
   elliptic curves over the prime fields P-256 and P-521, respectively,
   specified in the appendix D.1.2 of FIPS PUB 186-3 [FIPS.186-3.2009]
   specification.  The hash functions H, which are referenced by the
   core document, are SHA-256 for the P-256 curve and SHA-512 for the
   P-521 curve, respectively.  The representation of the parameters kc1,
   ks1, vkc, and vks is hex-fixed-number.

   Note: This algorithm is based on the Key Agreement Mechanism 3 (KAM3)
   defined in Section 6.3 of ISO/IEC 11770-4 [ISO.11770-4.2006] with a
   few modifications/improvements.  However, implementers should use
   this document as the normative reference, because the algorithm has
   been changed in several minor details as well as major improvements.

2.1.  Support Functions and Notations

   The algorithm definitions use several support functions and notations
   defined below:

   The integers in the specification are in decimal, or in hexadecimal
   when prefixed with "0x".

   The two functions named octet() and OCTETS() are those defined in the
   core specification [I-D.oiwa-http-mutualauth].

   Note: The definition of OCTETS() is different from the function
   GE2OS_x in the original ISO specification, which takes the shortest
   representation without preceding zeros.

   All of the algorithms defined in this specification use the default
   functions defined in the core specification for computing the values
   pi, VK_c and VK_s.

2.2.  Functions for Discrete-Logarithm Settings

   In this section, an equation (x / y mod z) denotes a natural number w
   less than z that satisfies (w * y) mod z = x mod z.

   For the discrete-logarithm, we refer to some of the domain parameters
   by using the following symbols:

   o  q: for "the prime" defining the MODP group.

   o  g: for "the generator" associated with the group.

   o  r: for the order of the subgroup generated by g.

   The function J is defined as

   J(pi) = g^(pi) mod q.

   The value of K_c1 is derived as

   K_c1 = g^(S_c1) mod q,

   where S_c1 is a random integer within range [1, r-1] and r is the
   size of the subgroup generated by g.  In addition, S_c1 MUST be
   larger than log(q)/log(g) (so that g^(S_c1) > q).

   The value of K_c1 SHALL satisfy 1 < K_c1 < q-1.  The server MUST
   check this condition upon reception.

   Let an intermediate value t_1 be

   t_1 = H(octet(1) | OCTETS(K_c1)),

   the value of K_s1 is derived from J(pi) and K_c1 as:

   K_s1 = (J(pi) * K_c1^(t_1))^(S_s1) mod q

   where S_s1 is a random number within range [1, r-1].  The value of
   K_s1 MUST satisfy 1 < K_s1 < q-1.  If this condition is not held, the
   server MUST retry using another value for S_s1.  The client MUST
   check this condition upon reception.

   Let an intermediate value t_2 be

   t_2 = H(octet(2) | OCTETS(K_c1) | OCTETS(K_s1)),

   the value z on the client side is derived by the following equation:

   z = K_s1^((S_c1 + t_2) / (S_c1 * t_1 + pi) mod r) mod q.

   The value z on the server side is derived by the following equation:

   z = (K_c1 * g^(t_2))^(S_s1) mod q.

2.3.  Functions for Elliptic-Curve Settings

   For the elliptic-curve setting, we refer to some of the domain
   parameters by the following symbols:

   o  q: for the prime used to define the group.

   o  G: for the defined point called the generator.

   o  r: for the order of the subgroup generated by G.

   The function P(p) converts a curve point p into an integer
   representing point p, by computing x * 2 + (y mod 2), where (x, y)
   are the coordinates of point p.  P'(z) is the inverse of function P,
   that is, it converts an integer z to a point p that satisfies P(p) =
   z.  If such p exists, it is uniquely defined.  Otherwise, z does not
   represent a valid curve point.  The operator + indicates the
   elliptic-curve group operation, and the operation [x] * p denotes an
   integer-multiplication of point p: it calculates p + p + ... (x
   times) ... + p.  See the literatures on elliptic-curve cryptography
   for the exact algorithms used for those functions (e.g.  Section 3 of
   [RFC6090], which uses different notations, though.) 0_E represents
   the infinity point.  The equation (x / y mod z) denotes an natural
   number w less than z that satisfies (w * y) mod z = x mod z.

   The function J is defined as

   J(pi) = [pi] * G.

   The value of K_c1 is derived as

   K_c1 = P(K_c1'), where K_c1' = [S_c1] * G,

   where S_c1 is a random number within range [1, r-1].  The value of
   K_c1 MUST represent a valid curve point, and K_c1' SHALL NOT be 0_E.
   The server MUST check this condition upon reception.

   Let an intermediate integer t_1 be

   t_1 = H(octet(1) | OCTETS(K_c1)),

   the value of K_s1 is derived from J(pi) and K_c1' = P'(K_c1) as:

   K_s1 = P([S_s1] * (J(pi) + [t_1] * K_c1')),

   where S_s1 is a random number within range [1, r-1].  The value of
   K_s1 MUST represent a valid curve point and satisfy [4] * P'(K_s1) <>
   0_E. If this condition is not satisfied, the server MUST retry using

   another value for S_s1.  The client MUST check this condition upon
   reception.

   Let an intermediate integer t_2 be

   t_2 = H(octet(2) | OCTETS(K_c1) | OCTETS(K_s1)),

   the value z on the client side is derived by the following equation:

   z = P([(S_c1 + t_2) / (S_c1 * t_1 + pi) mod r] * P'(K_s1)).

   The value z on the server side is derived by the following equation:

   z = P([S_s1] * (P'(K_c1) + [t_2] * G)).


3.  IANA Considerations

   Four tokens iso-kam3-dl-2048-sha256, iso-kam3-dl-4096-sha512,
   iso-kam3-ec-p256-sha256 and iso-kam3-ec-p521-sha512 shall be
   allocated and registered according to the provision of the core
   documentation when this document is promoted to an RFC.

   Note: More formal declarations will be added in the future drafts to
   meet the RFC 5226 requirements.


4.  Security Considerations

   Refer the corresponding section of the core specification for
   algorithm-independent, generic considerations.

   o  All random numbers used in these algorithms MUST be at least
      cryptographically computationally secure against forward and
      backward guessing attacks.

   o  Computation times of all numerical operations on discrete-
      logarithm group elements and elliptic-curve points MUST be
      normalized and made independent of the exact values, to prevent
      timing-based side-channel attacks.
