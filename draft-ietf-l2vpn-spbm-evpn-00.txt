            Shortest Path Bridging, MAC mode Support over EVPN 
                       draft-ietf-l2vpn-spbm-evpn-00 


Abstract 


   This document describes how Ethernet Shortest Path Bridging MAC mode 
   (802.1aq) can be combined with EVPN in a way that interworks with 
   PBB-PEs as described in the PBB-EVPN solution. This is achieved via   
   operational isolation of each Ethernet network subtending an EVPN 
   core while supporting full interworking between the different 
   variations of Ethernet networks.

1. Introduction 

   This document describes how Ethernet Shortest Path Bridging MAC mode 
   (802.1aq) along with PBB-PEs and PBBNs (802.1ah) can be supported by 
   EVPN such that each island is operationally isolated while providing 
   full L2 connectivity between them. Each island can use its own 
   control plane instance and multi-pathing design, be it multiple ECT 
   sets, or multiple spanning trees. 

   The intention is to permit both past, current and emerging future 
   versions of Ethernet to be seamlessly integrated to permit large 
   scale, geographically diverse numbers of Ethernet end systems to be 
   fully supported with EVPN as the unifying agent.

4. Solution Overview 

The EVPN solution for 802.1aq SPBM incorporates control plane 
interworking in the PE to map ISIS-SPB [RFC6329] information elements 
into the EVPN NLRI information and vice versa. This requires each PE to 
act both as an EVPN BGP speaker and as an ISIS-SPB edge node. Associated 
with this are procedures for configuring the forwarding operations of 
the PE such that an arbitrary number of EVPN subtending SPBM islands may 
be interconnected without any topological or multipathing dependencies. 
This model also permits PBB-PEs as defined in 0to be seamlessly 
communicate with the SPB islands.

Each EVPN is identified by a route target. The route target identifies 
the set of SPBM islands and PBB-PEs that are allowed to communicate. 
Each SPBM island is administered to have an associated Ethernet Segment 
ID (ESI) associated with it. This manifests itself as a set of Ethernet 
segments, where each ESI is unique within the route target. 
BGP acts as a common repository of the I-SID attachment points for the 
set of subtending PEs/SPBM islands. This is in the form of B-MAC 
address/I-SID/Tx-Rx-attribute tuples. BGP filters leaking I-SID 
information into each SPBM island on the basis of locally registered 
interest. If an SPBM island has no BEBs registering interest in an I-
SID, information about that I-SID from other SPBM islands, PBB-PEs or 
PBBNs will not be leaked into the local ISIS-SPB routing system. 
For each B-VID in an SPBM island, a single SPBM-PE is elected the 
designated forwarder for the B-VID. An SPBM-PE may be a DF for more than 
one B-VID. This is described further in section 4.2. The SPBM-PE 
originates IS-IS advertisements as if it were an IB-BEB that proxies for 
the other SPBM islands and PBB PEs in the EVPN defined by the route 
target, but the PE typically will not actually host any I-components. 
An SPBM-PE that is a DF for a B-VID strips the B-VID tag information 
from frames relayed towards the EVPN. The DF also inserts the 
appropriate B-VID tag information into frames relayed towards the SPBM 
island on the basis of the local I-SID/B-VID bindings advertised in 
ISIS-SPB. 
                                   
5. Elements of Procedure 

5.1. PE Configuration 

   At SPBM island commissioning a PE is configured with: 

   1) The route target for the service instance. Where a route target 
      is defined as identifying the set of SPBM islands, PBBNs and PBB-
      PEs to be interconnected by the EVPN. 

   2) The unique ESI for the SPBM island. Mechanisms for deriving a 
      unique ESI for the SPBM island are for further study. 

   And the following is configured as part of commissioning an ISIS-SPB 
   node: 

   1) A Shortest Path Source ID (SPSourceID) used for algorithmic 
      construction of multicast DA addresses. Note this is required for 
      SPBM BEBs independent of the EVPN operation.

Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-l2vpn-spbm-evpn-00          October 2013 
 

   2) The set of VLANs (identified by B-VIDs) used in the SPBM island 
      and multi-pathing algorithm IDs to use. The set of B-VIDs and 
      multi-pathing algorithms used may be different in different 
      domains and the B-VID itself is removed for frames carried over 
      the IP/MPLS network. 

   A type-1 Route Distinguisher for the node can be auto-derived. This 
   will be described in a future version of the document.  

5.2. DF Election 

   PEs self appoint in the role of DF for a B-VID for a given SPBM 
   island. The procedure used is as per section 9.5 of [EVPN] 
   "Designated Forwarder election". 
   A PE that assumes the role of DF for a given DF is responsible for 
   originating specific information into BGP from ISIS-SPB and vice 
   versa. A PE that ceases to perform the role of DF for a given B-VID 
   is responsible for withdrawing the associated information from BGP 
   and ISIS-SPB respectively. The actual information exchanged is 
   outlined in the following sections. 
    
5.3. Control plane interworking ISIS-SPB to EVPN 

   When a PE receives an SPBM service identifier and unicast address 
   sub-TLV as part of an ISIS-SPB MT capability TLV it checks if it is 
   the DF for the B-VID in the sub-TLV. 

   If it is the DF, and there is new or changed information then a MAC 
   advertisement route NLRI is created for each new I-SID in the sub-
   TLV. 

   - the Route Distinguisher is set to that of the PE. 

   - the ESI is that of the SPBM island. 

   - the Ethernet tag ID contains the I-SID (including the Tx/Rx 
     attributes). The encoding of I-SID information is as per figure 2. 

 
       0                   1                   2                   3

         Figure 2: I-SID encoding in the Ethernet tag-ID field 

   - the MAC address is copied from the sub-TLV 

   - an locally assigned MPLS label  

   Similarly in the scenario where a PE became elected DF for a B-VID in 
   an operating network, the IS-IS database would be processed in order 
   to construct the NLRI information associated with the new role of the 
   PE. 

   If the BGP database has NLRI information for the I-SID, and this is 
   the first instance of registration of interest in the I-SID from the 
   SPB island, the NLRI information with that tag is processed to 
   construct an updated set of SPBM service identifier and unicast 
   address sub-TLVs to be advertised by the PE. 

   The ISIS-SPB information is also used to keep current a local table 
   indexed by I-SID to indicate the associated B-VID for processing of 
   frames received from EVPN. When an I-SID is associated with more than 
   one B-VID, only one entry is allowed in the table. Rules for 
   preventing this are out of scope of this memo.  

5.4. Control plane interworking EVPN to ISIS-SPB 

   When a PE receives a BGP NLRI that is new information, it checks if 
   it is the elected DF to communicate this information into ISIS-SPB by 
   checking if the I-SID in the Ethernet Tag ID locally maps to the B-
   VID it is an elected DF for. Note that if no BEBs in the SPB island 
   have advertised any interest in the I-SID, it will not be associated 
   with any B-VID locally, and therefore not of interest. If the I-SID 
   is of local interest to the SPBM island and the PE is the DF for the 
   B-VID that that I-SID is locally mapped to, a SPBM service identifier 
   and unicast address sub-TLV is constructed/updated for advertisement 
   into ISIS-SPB. 

   The NLRI information advertised into ISIS-SPB is also used to locally 
   populate a forwarding table indexed by B-MAC+I-SID that points to the 
   label stack to impose on the SPBM frame. The bottom label being that 
   offered in the NLRI. 

5.5. Data plane Interworking 802.1aq SPBM island or PBB-PE to EVPN 

   When an PE receives a frame from the SPBM island in a B-VID for which 
   it is a DF, it looks up the B-MAC/I-SID information to determine the 
   label stack to be added to the frame for forwarding in the EVPN. The

Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-l2vpn-spbm-evpn-00          October 2013 
 

   PE strips the B-VID information from the frame, adds the label 
   information to the frame and forwards the resulting MPLS packet. 

5.6. Data plane Interworking EVPN to 802.1aq SPBM island 

   When a PE receives a packet from the EVPN it may infer the B-VID to 
   overwrite in the SPBM frame from the I-SID or by other means (such as 
   via the bottom label in the MPLS stack).  

   If the frame has a local multicast DA, it overwrites the SPsourceID 
   in the frame with the local SPsourceID. 

5.7. Data plane interworking EVPN to 802.1ah PBB-PE 

   A PBB-PE actually has no subtending PBBN nor concept of B-VID so no 
   frame processing is required. 

   A PBB-PE is required to accept SPBM encoded multicast DAs as if they 
   were 802.1ah encoded multicast DAs. The only information of interest 
   being that it is a multicast frame, and the I-SID encoded in the 
   lower 24 bits. 

5.8. Multicast Support 

   Refer to "mLDP extensions for integrating EVPN and multicast"[mLDP]. 

6. Other Aspects 

6.1. Flow Ordering 

   When per I-SID multicast is implemented via PE replication, a stable 
   network will preserve frame ordering between known unicast and 
   broadcast/unknown/multicast traffic (e.g. race conditions will not 
   exist). This cannot be guaranteed when multicast is used in the EVPN. 

6.2. Transit 

   Any PE that does not need to participate in the tandem calculations 
   at the B-MAC layer may use the IS-IS overload bit to exclude SPBM 
   tandem paths and behave as pure interworking platform.
