This document specifies the requirements iSCSI and its related
infrastructure should satisfy and the design considerations guiding
the iSCSI protocol development efforts.  In the interest of timely
adoption of the iSCSI protocol, the IPS group has chosen to focus
the first version of the protocol to work with the existing SCSI
architecture and commands, and the existing TCP/IP transport layer.
Both these protocols are widely-deployed and well-understood.  The
thought is that using these mature protocols will entail a minimum
of new invention, the most rapid possible adoption, and the greatest
compatibility with Internet architecture, protocols, and equipment.
