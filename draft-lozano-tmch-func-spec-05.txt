1.  Introduction

   Domain Name Registries may operate in special modes within certain
   periods of time to facilitate registration of domain names.

   Along with the upcoming introduction of new generic Top Level Domains
   (gTLD), two special modes will come into effect:

   o  Sunrise Period

   o  Trademark Claims Period

   The Sunrise and Trademark Claims Periods are defined in the gTLD
   Applicant Guidebook [ICANN-GTLD-AGB-20120604].

   This document describes the requirements, the architecture and the
   interfaces between the Trademark Clearing House (TMCH) and Domain
   Name Registries as well as between the TMCH and Domain Name
   Registrars for the provisioning and management of domain names during
   the Sunrise and Trademark Claims Periods.

   After the Terminology (Section 2) the Glossary (Section 3) is listed,
   followed by the architecture (Section 4) and the different process
   descriptions (Section 5).  Afterwards, in Section 6, the necessary
   Data Formats are defined, followed by their formal syntax
   (Section 7).

   For any date and/or time indications, Coordinated Universal Time
   (UTC) applies.

1.1.  Discussion

   Any interested parties are invited to contribute to the discussion of
   this draft and provide feedback.  The discussion currently takes
   place on the tmch-tech discussion list <tmch-tech@icann.org>.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming

   implementation.

   "tmNotice-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:tmNotice-1.0".  The XML namespace prefix
   "tmNotice" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.


3.  Glossary

   In the following the most common terms are briefly explained:

   o  Effective allocation: A DN is considered effectively allocated
      when the DN object for the DN has been created in the SRS of the
      Registry and has been assigned to the effective user.  A DN object
      in status "pendingCreate" or any other status that precedes the
      first time a DN is assigned to an end-user is not considered an
      effective allocation.  A DN object created internally by the
      Registry for subsequent delegation to another Registrant is not
      considered an effective allocation.

   o  Backend Registry Operator: Entity that manages (a part of) the
      technical infrastructure for a Registry Operator.  The Registry
      Operator may also be the Backend Registry Operator.

   o  CA: Certificate Authority, see [RFC5280] and [RFC6818]

   o  CSV: Comma-Separated Values, see [RFC4180]

   o  CNIS, Claims Notice Information Service: This service provides
      trademark claims notices to Registrars.

   o  CRC32, Cyclic Redundancy Check: algorithm used in the ISO 3309
      standard and in section 8.1.1.6.2 of ITU-T recommendation V.42.

   o  CRL: Certificate Revocation List, see [RFC5280] and [RFC6818].

   o  Date and time, datetime: Date and time are specified following the
      standard "Date and Time on the Internet specification", see
      [RFC3339].

   o  DN: Domain Name, see [RFC1034]

   o  DNS: Domain Name System, see [RFC1034]

   o  DNL, Domain Name Label: A label as specified in [RFC1035].  For
      IDNs the A-Label is used [RFC5890].

Internet-Draft       TMCH functional specifications           April 2013


   o  DNL List: A list of DNL that are covered by a PRM.

   o  EPP: Extensible Provisioning Protocol, see [RFC5730].

   o  FQDN: Fully Qualified Domain Name (e.g. myname.example.com)

   o  HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol, see [RFC2616]

   o  HTTPS: HTTP over TLS (Transport Layer Security), [RFC5246].

   o  ICANN-CA: ICANN's Certificate Authority (CA); Trust Anchor for the
      SMD PKI model.

   o  IDN: Internationalized Domain Name, see [RFC5890]

   o  LORDN, List of Registered Domain Names: This is the list of
      effectively allocated domain names matching a DNL of a PRM.
      Registries will upload this list to the TMDB (during the NORDN
      process).

   o  Lookup Key: A random string of up to 51 chars from the set [a-zA-
      Z0-9/] to be used as the lookup Key by Registrars to obtain the
      claims notice using the CNIS.  Lookup Keys are unique and are
      related to one DNL only.

   o  NORDN, Notification of Registered Domain Names: The process by
      which Registries upload their recent LORDN to the TMDB.

   o  PGP: Pretty Good Privacy, see [RFC4880]

   o  PKI: Public Key Infrastructure, see [RFC5280] and [RFC6818]

   o  PRM, Pre-registered mark: Mark that has been pre-registered with
      the TMCH.

   o  Registrant: Person or Organization registering a Domain Name via a
      Registrar.

   o  Registrar, Domain Name Registrar: Entity that registers Domain
      Names with the Registry on behalf of the Registrant.

   o  Registry, Registry Operator, Domain Name Registry: Entity that
      accepts Domain Name registrations from Registrars, maintains the
      central Database of Registered Domains.  A Registry Operator is
      the contracting party for the TLD.

   o  SMD, Signed Mark Data: A cryptographically signed token issued by
      the TMV to the TMH to be used in the Sunrise Period to apply for a

      Domain Name that matches a DNL of a PRM; see also
      [I-D.lozano-tmch-smd]

   o  SMD File: A file containing the SMD (see above) and some human
      readable data.  The latter is usually ignored in the processing of
      the SMD File.  See also Section 6.4.

   o  SMDM, SMD Manager: A entity managing the SMDs, mainly maintaining
      lists of revoked SMDs; see also [I-D.lozano-tmch-smd]

   o  SMD revocation list: The SMD revocation list is used by Registries
      (and optionally by Registrars) during the Sunrise Period to ensure
      that an SMD is still valid (i.e. not revoked).  The SMD revocation
      list has a similar function as CRLs used in PKI.

   o  SRS: Shared Registration System, see also
      [ICANN-GTLD-AGB-20120604].

   o  Sunrise Period: During this period Domain Names matching a DNL of
      a PRM can be exclusively obtained by the respective mark holders.
      For domain names matching a PRM, a special process applies to
      ensure a TMH gets informed on the effective allocation of a domain
      name matching his/her PRM.  Every launch of a new gTLD Registry
      starts with a Sunrise Period, followed by a Trademark Claims
      Period.

   o  TLD: Top Level Domain Name, see [RFC1591]

   o  Trademark, mark: Marks are used to claim exclusive properties of
      products or services.  A mark is typically a name, word, phrase,
      logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements.
      For the scope of this document only textual marks are relevant.

   o  Trademark Claims, Claims: Provides information to enhance the
      understanding of the Trademark rights being claimed by the
      Trademark Holder.

   o  Trademark Claims Notice, Claims Notice, Trademark Notice, TCN: A
      Trademark Claims Notice consist of one or more Trademark Claims
      and are provided to prospective Registrants of Domain Names.

   o  Trademark Claims Notice Identifier, TCNID: An element of the
      Trademark Claims Notice (see above), identifying said Claims
      Notice.  The Trademark Claims Notice Identifier is specified in
      the element <tmNotice:id>.

   o  Trademark Claims Period: During this period, a special process
      applies to DNs matching the DNL list, to ensure a TMH gets

Internet-Draft       TMCH functional specifications           April 2013


      informed of a domain name matching his PRM.  For DNs matching the
      DNL list, Registrars show a Trademark Claims Notice to prospective
      Registrants that has to be acknowledged before effective
      allocation.

   o  TMCH, Trademark Clearinghouse: The Trademark Clearinghouse is an
      ICANN central repository for information to be authenticated,
      stored, and disseminated, pertaining to the rights of trademark
      holders.  The Clearinghouse is split into two functions TMV and
      TMDB (see below).  There could be several entities performing the
      TMV function, but only one entity performing the TMDB function.

   o  TMDB, Trademark Clearinghouse Database: Serves as a database of
      the TMCH to provide information to the new gTLD Registries and
      Registrars to support Sunrise or Trademark Claims Services.  There
      is only one TMDB in the TMCH that concentrates the information
      about the "verified" Trademark records from the TMVs.

   o  TMH, Trademark Holder: The person or organization owning rights on
      a Trademark.

   o  TMV, Trademark Validator, Trademark validation organization: An
      entity authorized by ICANN to authenticate and validate
      registrations in the TMDB ensuring the marks qualify as registered
      or are court-validated marks or marks that are protected by
      statute or treaty.  This entity would also be asked to ensure that
      proof of use of marks is provided, which can be demonstrated by
      furnishing a signed declaration and one specimen of current use.

   o  UTC: Coordinated Universal Time, as maintained by the Bureau
      International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM); see also [RFC3339].

4.3.  Interfaces

   In the sub-sections below follows a short description of each
   interface to provide an overview of the architecture.  More detailed
   descriptions of the relevant interfaces follow further below
   (Section 5).

4.3.1.  hv

   The TMH registers a mark with a TMV via the hv interface.

   After the successful registration of the mark, the TMV makes
   available a SMD (Signed Mark Data) file (see also Section 6.4) to the
   TMH to be used during the Sunrise Period.

   The specifics of the hv interface are beyond the scope of this
   document.

4.3.2.  vd

   After successful mark registration, the TMV ensures the TMDB inserts
   the corresponding DNLs and mark information into the database via the
   vd interface.

   The specifics of the vd interface are beyond the scope of this
   document.

4.3.3.  dy

   Not used during the Sunrise Period.

4.3.7.  yd

   During the Sunrise period the Registry notifies the TMDB at least
   daily via the yd interface of all domain names effectively allocated.

   During the Trademark Claims period, the Registry notifies at least
   daily the TMDB via the yd interface of all domains effectively
   allocated that matched an entry in the Registry's DNL during the
   creation of the domain name.

   The protocol used on the yd interface is HTTPS.

4.3.8.  dv

   The TMDB notifies via the dv interface to the TMV of all domains
   effectively allocated that match a mark registered by that TMV.

   The specifics of the dv interface are beyond the scope of this
   document.

5.2.2.  DN Registration by Registries

   Registries MUST perform a minimum set of checks for verifying DN
   registrations during Sunrise Period upon reception of a registration
   request over the ry interface (Section 4.3.5).  If any of these
   checks fails the Registry MUST abort the registration.  Each of these
   checks MUST be performed before the DN is effectively allocated.

   In case of asynchronous registrations (e.g. auctions), the minimum
   set of checks MAY be performed when creating the intermediate object
   (e.g. a domain name application) used for DN registration.  If the
   minimum set of checks is performed when creating the intermediate
   object (e.g. a domain name application) a Registry MAY effective
   allocate the DN without performing the minimum set of checks again.
   However, the validation of the SMD compared to the moment of
   effective allocation of the DN MUST NOT be older than a period of
   time, i.e., the SMD-validation validity period that is defined in the
   RPM requirements document referenced in Specification 7 of the gTLD
   Applicant Guidebook [ICANN-GTLD-AGB-20120604].

   Performing the minimum set of checks Registries MUST verify that:

   1.  A SMD has been received from the Registrar along with the DN
       registration.

   2.  The certificate of the TMV has been correctly signed by the
       ICANN-CA.  (The certificate of the TMV is contained within the
       SMD.)

   3.  The validity period of the TMV certificate is within the allowed
       range.

   4.  The certificate of the TMV is not be listed in the CRL file
       specified in the CRL distribution point of the TMV certificate.

   5.  The signature of the SMD (signed with the TMV certificate) is
       valid.

   6.  The validity period of the SMD is within the allowed range (<smd:
       notBefore> and <smd:notAfter> elements).

   7.  The SMD has not been revoked, i.e., is not contained in the SMD
       revocation list.

   8.  The leftmost DNS label (A-label in case of IDNs) of the DN being
       effectively allocated matches one of the labels (<mark:label>)
       elements in the SMD.

   These procedure apply to all DN effective allocations at the second
   level as well as to all other levels subordinate to the TLD that the
   Registry accepts registrations for.

5.2.3.  TMCH Sunrise Services for Registries

5.2.3.1.  SMD Revocation List

   A new SMD revocation list MUST be published by the SMDM twice a day,
   by 00:00:00 and 12:00:00 UTC.

   Registries MUST refresh the latest version of the SMD revocation list
   at least once every 24 hours.

   Note: the SMD Revocation List will be the same regardless of the TLD.
   If a Backend Registry Operator manages the infrastructure of several
   TLDs, the Backend Registry Operator could refresh the SMD Revocation
   List once every 24 hours, the SMD Revocation List could be used for
   all the TLDs managed by the Backend Registry Operator.

5.2.3.2.  Certificate Revocation List

   Registries MUST refresh their local copy of the CRL at least every 24
   hours using the CRL distribution point specified in the TMV
   certificate.

   Operationally, the CRL file and CRL distribution point is the same
   for all TMVs and (at publication of this document) located at
   < http://crl.icann.org/tmch.crl >.

   Note: the CRL file will be the same regardless of the TLD.  If a
   Backend Registry Operator manages the infrastructure of several TLDs,
   the Backend Registry Operator could refresh the CRL file once every
   24 hours, the CRL file could be used for all the TLDs managed by the
   Backend Registry Operator.

5.2.3.3.  Notice of Registered Domain Names

   The Registry MUST send a LORDN file containing DNs effectively
   allocated to the TMDB (over the yd interface, Section 4.3.7).

   The registration of a DN MUST be reported by the Registry to the TMDB
   within 26 hours of the effective allocation.

   The Registry SHOULD upload at least two LORDN files per day to the
   TMDB.

   The Registry SHOULD NOT upload more than eight LORDN files per day to
   the TMDB.

   The Registry SHOULD upload a LORDN file only if the previous LORDN
   LOG file has been downloaded from the TMDB.

   The Registry MUST send LORDN files for DNs effectively allocated
   during Sunrise or Claims period.

   The yd interface (Section 4.3.7) MAY support up to 10 concurrent
   connections from each IP address registered by a Registry Operator to
   access the service.

   The TMDB MUST process each uploaded LORDN file within 30 minutes of
   the finalization of the upload and have the response indicating the
   errors and warnings to the Registry.

5.3.2.  DN registration by Registries

   During Trademark Claim Periods, Registries perform two main
   functions:

   o  Registries MUST provide Registrars (over the ry interface,
      Section 4.3.5) the Lookup Key used to retrieve the Trademark
      Claims for domain names that match the DNL list.

   o  Registries MUST provide the Lookup Key only when queried about a
      specific DN.

   o  For any DN matching a DNL of a PRM, Registries MUST perform a
      minimum set of checks for verifying DN registrations during
      Trademark Claims Period upon reception of a registration request
      over the ry interface (Section 4.3.5).  If any of these checks
      fails the Registry MUST abort the registration.  Each of these
      checks MUST be performed before the DN is effectively allocated.

   o  In case of asynchronous registrations (e.g. auctions), the minimum
      set of checks MAY be performed when creating the intermediate
      object (e.g. a domain name application) used for DN effective
      allocation.  If the minimum set of checks is performed when
      creating the intermediate object (e.g. a domain name application)
      a Registry MAY effective allocate the DN without performing the
      minimum set of checks again.  However, the acknowledgement of the
      Trademark Notice compared to the moment of effective allocation of
      the DN MUST NOT be older than a period of time, i.e., the TCN-Ack
      validity period that is defined in the RPM requirements document
      referenced in Specification 7 of the gTLD Applicant Guidebook
      [ICANN-GTLD-AGB-20120604].

   o  Performing the minimum set of checks Registries MUST verify that:

      1.  The Trademark Claims Notice Identifier, expiration datetime
          and acceptance datetime of the Trademark Notice, have been
          received from the Registrar along with the DN registration.

             If the three elements mentioned above are not provided by
             the Registrar for a DN matching a DNL of a PRM, but the DNL
             was inserted (or re-inserted) for the first time into DNL
             list less than 24 hours ago, the registration MAY continue
             without this data and the tests listed below are not
             required to be performed.

      2.  The claim notice has not expired (according to the expiration
          datetime sent by the Registrar).

Internet-Draft       TMCH functional specifications           April 2013


      3.  The acceptance datetime is no more than 48 hours in the past.

      4.  Using the leftmost DNS label (A-label in the case of IDNs) of
          the DN being registered, the expiration datetime provided by
          the registrar, and the TMDB Notice Identifier extracted from
          the Trademark Claims Notice Identifier provided by the
          registrar compute the TM Notice Checksum.  Verify that the
          computed TM Notice Checksum match the TM Notice Checksum
          present in the Trademark Claims Notice Identifier (see, <
          xref="procDescClaimsNotice" />).

   These procedures apply to all DN registrations at the second level as
   well as to all other levels subordinate to the TLD that the Registry
   accepts registrations for.

5.3.3.  Trademark Claims Services for Registries

5.3.3.1.  Domain Name Label (DNL) List

   A new DNL list MUST be published by the TMDB twice a day, by 00:00:00
   and 12:00:00 UTC.

   Registries MUST refresh the latest version of the DNL list at least
   once every 24 hours.

   Update DNL list

                                 Figure 8

   Note: the DNL List will be the same regardless of the TLD.  If a
   Backend Registry Operator manages the infrastructure of several TLDs,
   the Backend Registry Operator could refresh the DNL List once every
   24 hours, the DNL List could be used for all the TLDs managed by the
   Backend Registry Operator.

5.3.3.2.  Notice of Registered Domain Names

   The NORDN process during the Trademark Claims Period is almost the
   same as during Sunrise Period as defined in Section 5.2.3.3 with the
   difference that only registrations subject to a Trademark Claim
   (i.e., at registration time the name appeared in the current DNL list
   downloaded by the Registry) are included in the LORDN.

   If reporting the LORDN of the day when the Registry transition from
   the Sunrise Period to Trademark Claims Period, the TMDB MUST support

   receiving two LORDN files for the same date.  A Registry MAY submit
   two LORDN files, for Sunrise and Claims, respectively.

5.3.4.  DN Registration by Registrars

   For any DN matching a DNL of a PRM, Registrars MUST perform the
   following steps:

   1.  Use the Lookup Key received from the Registry to obtain the
       Claims Notice from the TMDB using the dr interface
       (Section 4.3.6) Registrars MUST only query for the Lookup Key of
       a DN that is available for registration.

   2.  Present the Claims Notice to the Registrant as described in
       [ICANN-GTLD-AGB-20120604].

   3.  Ask Registrant for acknowledgement, i.e. the Registrant MUST
       consent with the Claims Notice, before any further processing.
       (The transmission of a Trademark Claims Notice Identifier to the
       Registry over the ry interface, Section 4.3.5 implies that the
       Registrant has expressed his consent with the Claims Notice.)

   4.  Perform the minimum set of checks for verifying DN registrations.
       If any of these checks fails the Registrar MUST abort the DN
       registration.  Each of these checks MUST be performed before the
       registration is sent to the Registry.  Performing the minimum set
       of checks Registrars MUST verify that:

       1.  The claim notice has not expired (using expiration date
           (<tmNotice:notAfter>).

       2.  The claim notice validity based on the (<tmNotice:
           notBefore>).

       3.  The leftmost DNS label (A-label in case of IDNs) of the DN
           being effectively allocated matches the label (<tmNotice:
           label>) element in the Trademark Claim Notice.

       4.  The Registrant has acknowledged (expressed his consent with)
           the Claims Notice.

   5.  Record the date and time when the registrant acknowledged the
       trademark claims notice.

   6.  Send the registration to the Registry (ry interface,
       Section 4.3.5) and include the following information:

       *  Trademark Claims Notice Identifier (<tmNotice:id>)

       *  Expiration date of the claims notice (<tmNotice:notAfter>)

       *  Acceptance datetime of the trademark claims notice.

   Claims notices are generated twice a day.  The expiration date
   (<tmNotice:notAfter>) of each claims notice MUST be set to 48 hours
   in the future, allowing the implementation of a cache by Registrars
   and enough time for acknowledging the TM notice.  Registrars SHOULD
   implement a cache of claims notices to minimize the number of queries
   sent to the TMDB.  A cached TM Notice MUST be removed from the cache
   after the expiration date of the TM notice as defined by <tmNotice:
   notAfter>.  The TMDB MAY implement rate-limiting as one of the
   protection mechanisms to mitigate the risk of performance
   degradation.

5.3.5.  Trademark Claims Services for Registrars

5.3.5.1.  Claims Notice Information Service

   The Trademark Claims Notices are provided by the TMDB online and are
   fetched by the Registrar via the dr interface (Section 4.3.6).

   To get access to the Trademark Claims Notices, the Registrar needs
   the credentials provided by the TMDB (Section 5.1.2.1) and the Lookup
   Key received from the Registry via the ry interface (Section 4.3.5).
   The dr interface (Section 4.3.6) uses HTTPS with Basic access
   authentication.

   The dr interface (Section 4.3.6) MAY support up to 10 concurrent
   connections from each Registrar.

   The URL of the dr interface (Section 4.3.6) is:

      < https://<tmdb-domain-name>/cnis/<lookupkey>.xml >

   Note that the "lookupkey" may contain SLASH characters ("/").  The
   SLASH character is part of the URL path and MUST NOT be escaped when
   requesting the Trademark Claims Notice.

   The TLS certificate (HTTPS) used on the dr interface (Section 4.3.6)
   MUST be signed by a well-know public CA.  Registrars MUST perform the
   Certification Path Validation described in Section 6 of [RFC5280].
   Registrars will be authenticated in the dr interface using HTTP Basic
   access authentication.  The dr (Section 4.3.6) interface MUST support
   HTTPS keep-alive and MUST maintain the connection for up to 30
   minutes.

6.  Data Format Descriptions

6.1.  DNL List file

   This section defines format of the list containing every Domain Name
   Label (DNL) that matches a Pre-Registered Mark (PRM).  The list is
   maintained by the TMDB and downloaded by Registries in regular
   intervals (see Section 5.3.3.1).  The Registries use the DNL list
   during the Trademark Claims period to check whether a requested DN
   matched a DNL of a PRM.

   The DNL list is contained in a CSV-like formatted file that has the
   following structure:

   o  first line: <version>,<DNL list creation datetime>

         Where:

         +  <version>, version of the file.  Version 1 MUST always be
            present.

         +  <DNL list creation datetime>, date and time in UTC that the
            DNL was created.

   o  second line: a header line as specified in [RFC4180]

         With the header names as follows:

         DNL,lookup-key,insertion-datetime

   o  One or more lines with: <DNL>,<lookup key>,<DNL insertion
      datetime>

         Where:

         +  <DNL>, a domain label covered by a trademark.

         +  <lookup key>, lookup key that the registry MUST provide to
            the registrar.  The lookupkey has the following format:
            <YYYY><MM><DD><vv>/<X>/<X>/<X>/<Random bits><Sequential
            number>, where:

            -  YYYY: year that the claims notice was generated.

            -  MM: zero-padded month that the claims notice was
               generated.

            -  DD: zero-padded day that the claims notice was generated.

            -  vv: version of the claims notice, possible values are 00
               and 01.

            -  X: one hexadecimal digit [0-9A-F].  This is the first,
               second and third hexadecimal digit of encoding the
               <Random bits> in base16 as specified in [RFC4648].

            -  Random bits: 144 random bits encoded in base64url as
               specified in [RFC4648].

            -  Sequential number: zero-padded natural number in the
               range 0000000001 to 2147483647.

         +  <DNL insertion datetime>, datetime in UTC that the DNL was
            first inserted into the DNL.  The possible two values of
            time for inserting a DNL to the DNL list are 00:00:00 and
            12:00:00 UTC.

6.2.  SMD revocation list

   This section defines format of the list of SMDs that have been
   revoked.  The list is maintained by the SMDM and downloaded by
   Registries (and optionally by Registrars) in regular intervals (see
   Section 5.2.3.1).  The SMD revocation list is used during the Sunrise
   Period to validate SMDs received.  The SMD revocation list has a
   similar function as CRLs used in PKI [RFC5280] / [RFC6818].

   The SMD revocation list is contained in a CSV-like formatted file
   that has the following structure:

   o  first line: <version>,<SMD revocation list creation datetime>

         Where:

         +  <version>, version of the file.  Version 1 MUST always be
            present.

         +  <SMD revocation list creation datetime>, datetime in UTC
            that the SMD revocation list was created.

   o  second line: a header line as specified in [RFC4180]

         With the header names as follows:

         smd-id,insertion-datetime

   o  One or more lines with: <smd-id>,<revoked smd datetime>

         Where:

         +  <smd-id>, identifier of the SMD that was revoked.

         +  <revoked smd datetime>, revocation datetime in UTC of the
            SMD.  The possible two values of time for inserting a DNL to
            the DNL list are 00:00:00 and 12:00:00 UTC.

   To provide integrity protection, the SMD revocation list is PGP
   [RFC4880] signed by the TMDB with the private key of the TMDB (see
   also Section 5.1.1.4).  The SMD revocation list is provided by the
   TMDB with extension .csv.  The PGP signature of the SMD revocation
   list can be found in the similar URI but with extension .sig as shown
   below.

6.3.  LORDN File

   This section defines the format of the List of Registered Domain
   Names (LORDN), which is maintained by each Registry and uploaded at
   least daily to the TMDB.  Every time a DN matching a DNL of a PRL
   said DN is added to the LORDN along with further information related
   to its registration.

   The URI of the dy interface (Section 4.3.3) used to upload the LORDN
   file is:

   o  Sunrise LORDN file:

         < https://<tmdb-domain-name>/LORDN/<TLD>/sunrise >

   o  Claims LORDN file:

         < https://<tmdb-domain-name>/LORDN/<TLD>/claims >

   The dy interface (Section 4.3.3) returns the following HTTP status
   codes after a HTTP POST request method is received:

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/202 status code if the interface was
      able to receive the LORDN file, the syntax of the LORDN file is
      correct and the LORDN file will be processed later.

         The interface provides the LORDN Transaction Identifier in the
         HTTP Entity-body that would be used by the Registry to download
         the LORDN Log file.  The LORDN Transaction Identifier is a
         natural number zero-padded in the range 0000000000000000001 to
         9223372036854775807.

         The HTTP Location header field contains the URI where the LORDN
         Log file could be retrieved later, for example:

            202 Accepted

            Location: https://<tmdb-domain-name>/LORDN/example/sunrise/
            0000000000000000001/result

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/400 if the request is incorrect or
      the syntax of the LORDN file is incorrect.  The TMDB MUST return a
      human readable message in the HTTP Entity-body regarding the
      incorrect syntax of the LORDN file.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/401 status code if the credentials
      provided does not authorize the Registry Operator to upload a
      LORDN file.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/500 status code if the system is
      experiencing a general failure.

   For example, to upload the Sunrise LORDN file for TLD "example", the
   URI would be:

      < https://<tmdb-domain-name>/LORDN/example/sunrise >

   The LORDN is contained in a CSV-like formatted file that has the
   following structure:

   o  For Sunrise Period:

      *  first line: <version>,<LORDN creation datetime>,<Number of
         lines>

            Where:

            -  <version>, version of the file.  Version 1 MUST always be
               present.

            -  <LORDN creation datetime>, date and time in UTC that the
               LORDN was created.

            -  <Number of lines>, number of domain names allocated on
               the reporting date <date of registration>.

      *  second line: a header line as specified in [RFC4180]

            With the header names as follows:

            roid,domain-name,SMD-id,registrar-id,registration-
            datetime,application-datetime

      *  One or more lines with: <roid>,<DN registered>,<smd-id>, <IANA
         registrar id>,<datetime of registration>,<datetime of
         application creation>

            Where:

            -  <roid>, Repository Object IDentifier (ROID) in the SRS.

            -  <DN registered>, domain name that was allocated.

            -  <SMD-id>, SMD ID used when the domain was allocated.

            -  <IANA registrar ID>, IANA registrar ID.

6.3.1.  LORDN Log File

   After reception of the LORDN File, the TMDB verifies its content for
   syntactical and semantical correctness.  The output of the LORDN File
   verification is retrieved using the dy interface (Section 4.3.3).

   The URI of the dy interface (Section 4.3.3) used to retrieve the
   LORDN Log File is:

   o  Sunrise LORDN Log file:

         < https://<tmdb-domain-name>/LORDN/<TLD>/sunrise/
         <lordn-transaction-identifier>/result >

   o  Claims LORDN Log file:

         < https://<tmdb-domain-name>/LORDN/<TLD>/claims/
         <lordn-transaction-identifier>/result >

   A Registry Operator MUST NOT send more than one request per minute
   per TLD to download a LORDN Log file.

   The dy interface (Section 4.3.3) returns the following HTTP status
   codes after a HTTP GET request method is received:

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/200 status code if the interface was
      able to provide the LORDN Log file.  The LORDN Log file is
      contained in the HTTP Entity-body.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/204 status code if the LORDN
      Transaction Identifier is correct, but the server has not
      finalized processing the LORDN file.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/400 status code if the request is
      incorrect.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/401 status code if the credentials
      provided does not authorize the Registry Operator to download the
      LORDN Log file.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/404 status code if the LORDN
      Transaction Identifier is incorrect.

   o  The interface provides a HTTP/500 status code if the system is
      experiencing a general failure.

         +  <LORDN Log creation datetime>, date and time in UTC that the
            LORDN Log was created.

         +  <LORDN file creation datetime>, date and time in UTC of
            creation for the LORDN file that this log file is referring
            to.

         +  <LORDN Log Identifier>, unique identifier of the LORDN Log
            provided by the TMDB.  This identifier could be used by the
            Registry Operator to unequivocally identify the LORDN Log.
            The identified will be a string of a maximum LENGTH of 60
            characters from the Base 64 alphabet.

         +  <Status flag>, whether the LORDN file has been accepted for
            processing by the TMDB.  Possible values are "accepted" or
            "rejected".

         +  <Warning flag>, whether the LORDN Log has any warning result
            codes.  Possible values are "no-warnings" or "warnings-
            present".

         +  <Number of lines>, number of DNs effective allocations
            processed in the LORDN file.

6.3.1.1.  LORDN Log Result Codes

   In Figure 14 the classes of result codes (rc) are listed.  Those
   classes in square brackets are not used at this time, but may come
   into use at some later stage.  The first two digits of a result code
   denote the result code class, which defines the outcome at the TMDB:

   o  ok: Success, domain name line accepted

   o  warn: a warning is issued, domain name line accepted

   o  err: an error is issued, LORDN file rejected

   In case of a LORDN file is rejected, the DN lines with error result
   codes (45xx and 46xx) will be reported in the LORDN Log file.  The DN
   lines that are syntactically valid will be reported with a 2001
   result code.  A 2001 result code means that the DN line is
   syntactically valid, however the DN line was not processed because
   the LORDN file was rejected.

         Domain Name line successfully processed.

   2001  OK but not processed
         Domain Name line is syntactically correct but the
         LORDN file was rejected.

   3601  TCN Acceptance Date after Registration Date
         TCN Acceptance Date in Domain Name is newer than the
         Registration Date.

   3602  Duplicate DN Line
         This DN Line is an exact duplicate of another line in same
         file, DN line ignored.

   3603  ROID Notified Earlier
         Same ROID has been notified earlier, DN line ignored.

   3604  TM Notice Checksum invalid
         Based on the DN allocated, the TMC-ID and
         the expiration date of the linked TM notice, the
         TM Notice Checksum is invalid.

   3605  TMC-ID Expired
         Trademark Claim Notice Identifier was expired
         when accepted, but still accepted.
         In case of an asynchronous registration, this may refer
         to the date of the application creation.

   3606  Wrong TMC-ID used
         The TMC-ID used for the registration was not valid
         for this DN.

   3607  SMD-Validation too old
         The validation of the SMD was done outside of the
         SMD-validation validity period, and still was used for
         registration.

   3608  TCN-Acknowledgement too old
         The Acknowledgement of the TCN was done outside of the
         TCN-Ack validity period, and still was used for registration.

   3609  Invalid SMD used
         The SMD used for registration was not valid. In case of
         an asynchronous registration, this may refer to the date of
         the application creation.

   3610  DN reported outside of the time window
         The DN was reported outside of the required 26 hours

         reporting window.

   4501  Syntax Error in DN line
         Syntax Error in Domain Name line.

   4601  Invalid TLD used
         The TLD in the DN line does not match what is expected
         for this LORDN.

   4602  Registrar ID Invalid
         Registrar ID in DN line is not valid (ICANN-Accredited
         Registrar).

   4603  Registration Date in the future
         Registration Date in the DN line is in the future.

   4604  Sunrise DN / application reported for TLD in Claims
         The DN datetime of registration / application creation
         datetime was reported in Sunrise LORDN when the TLD was
         in Claims.

   4605  Claims DN / application reported for TLD in Sunrise
         The DN datetime of registration / application creation
         datetime was reported in Claims LORDN when the TLD was
         in Sunrise.

   4606  TLD not in Sunrise or Claims
         The DN datetime of registration / application creation
         datetime was reported in LORDN when the TLD was not in
         Sunrise or Claims.

6.4.  SMD File

   This section defines the format of the SMD File.  After a successful
   registration of a mark, the TMV returns an SMD File to the TMH.  The
   SMD file can then be used for registration of one or more DNs covered
   by the PRM during the Sunrise Period of a TLD.

   Two encapsulation boundaries are defined for delimiting the
   encapsulated base64 encoded SMD: i.e. "-----BEGIN ENCODED SMD-----"
   and "-----END ENCODED SMD-----".  Only data inside the encapsulation
   boundaries MUST be used by Registries and Registrars for validation
   purposes, i.e. any data outside these boundaries as well as the
   boundaries themselves MUST be ignored for validation purposes.

   The structure of the SMD File is as follows:

   o  Marks: <marks>

   o  smdID: <smd-ID>

   o  U-labels: <comma separated list of U-labels>

   o  notBefore: <begin validity>

   o  notAfter: <end validity>

   o  -----BEGIN ENCODED SMD-----

   o  <encoded SMD (see [I-D.lozano-tmch-smd])>

   o  -----END ENCODED SMD-----

6.5.  Trademark Claims Notice

   The TMDB MUST provide the Trademark Claim Notice to Registrars in XML
   format as specified below.

   An enclosing element <tmNotice:notice> that describes the Trademark
   Notice to a given label.

   The child elements of the <tmNotice:notice> element include:

   o  A <tmNotice:id> element that contains the unique identifier of the
      Trademark Notice.  This element contains the the Trademark Claims
      Notice Identifier.

         The Trademark Claims Notice Identifier is a string
         concatenation of a TM Notice Checksum and the TMDB Notice
         Identifier.  The first 8 characters of the Trademark Claims
         Notice Identifier is a TM Notice Checksum.  The rest is the
         TMDB Notice Identifier, which is a zero-padded natural number
         in the range of 0000000000000000001 to 9223372036854775807.

         Example of a Trademark Claims Notice Identifier:

            370d0b7c9223372036854775807.

         Where:

         +  TM Notice Checksum=370d0b7c

         +  TMDB Notice Identifier=9223372036854775807

         The TM Notice Checksum is a 8 characters long Base16 encoded
         output of computing the CRC32 of the string concatenation of:
         label + unix_timestamp(<tmNotice:notAfter>) + TMDB Notice
         Identifier

         TMDB MUST use the Unix time conversion of the <tmNotice:
         notAfter> in UTC to calculate the TM Notice Checksum.  Unix
         time is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed
         since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z not counting leap seconds.  For
         example, the conversion to Unix time of 2010-08-16T09:00:00.0Z
         is shown:

            unix_time(2010-08-16T09:00:00.0Z)=1281949200

         The TMDB uses the <tmNotice:label> and <tmNotice:notAfter>
         elements from the Trademark Notice along with the TMDB Notice
         Identifier to compute the TM Notice Checksum.

Internet-Draft       TMCH functional specifications           April 2013


         A registry MUST use the leftmost DNS label (A-label in case of
         IDNs) of the DN being registered, the expiration datetime of
         the Trademark Notice and the TMDB Notice Identifier extracted
         from the Trademark Claims Notice Identifier provided by the
         Registrar to compute the TM Notice Checksum.  For example the
         DN "foo.bar.example" being effectively allocated, the left most
         label would be "foo".

         Example of computation of the TM Notice Checksum:

            CRC32(example-one12819492009223372036854775807)=370d0b7c

   o  A <tmNotice:notBefore> element that contains the start of the
      validity date and time of the TM notice.

   o  A <tmNotice:notAfter> element that contains the expiration date
      and time of the TM notice.

   o  A <tmNotice:label> elements that contain the DNS label (A-label in
      case of IDNs) form of the label that correspond to the DN covered
      by a PRM.

   o  One or more <tmNotice:claim> elements that contain the claim.  The
      <tmNotice:claim> element contains the following child elements:

      *  A <tmNotice:markName> element that contains the mark text
         string.

      *  One or more <tmNotice:holder> elements that contains the
         information of the holder of the mark.  An "entitlement"
         attribute is used to identify the entitlement of the holder,
         possible values are: owner, assignee and licensee.

      *  Zero or more OPTIONAL <tmNotice:contact> elements that contains
         the information of the representative of the mark registration.
         A "type" attribute is used to identify the type of contact,
         possible values are: owner, agent or thirdparty.

      *  A <tmNotice:jurDesc> element that contains the name (in
         English) of the jurisdiction where the trademark is protected.
         A jurCC attribute contains the two-character code of the
         jurisdiction where the trademark was registered.  This is a
         two-character code from [WIPO.ST3].

      *  Zero or more OPTIONAL <tmNotice:classDesc> element that
         contains the description (in English) of the Nice
         Classification as defined in [WIPO-NICE-CLASSES].  A classNum
         attribute contains the class number.

         registration document.
