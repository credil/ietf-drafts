Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2012      

1.  Introduction

   Two main Quality of Service (QoS) architectures have been specified 
   by the IETF. These are the Integrated Services (Intserv) [RFC1633]
   architecture and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture
   ([RFC2475]).

   Intserv provides methods for the delivery of end-to-end Quality of 
   Service (QoS) to applications over heterogeneous networks. One of the 
   QoS signaling protocols used by the Intserv architecture is the 
   Resource reServation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205], which can be used by
   applications to request per-flow resources from the network. These 
   RSVP requests can be admitted or rejected by the network.
   Applications can express their quantifiable resource requirements 
   using Intserv parameters as defined in [RFC2211] and [RFC2212]. The 
   Controlled Load (CL) service [RFC2211] is a quality of service (QoS) 
   closely approximating the QoS that the same flow would receive from a 
   lightly loaded network element. The CL service is useful for 
   inelastic flows such as those used for real-time media. 

   The DiffServ architecture can support the differentiated treatment of 
   packets in very large scale environments. While Intserv and RSVP 
   classify packets per-flow, Diffserv networks classify packets into 
   one of a small number of aggregated flows or "classes", based on the
   Diffserv codepoint (DSCP) in the packet IP header. At each Diffserv
   router, packets are subjected to a "per-hop behavior" (PHB), which is
   invoked by the DSCP.  The primary benefit of Diffserv is its
   scalability, since the need for per-flow state and per-flow
   processing, is eliminated. 

   However, DiffServ does not include any mechanism for communication
   between applications and the network.  Several solutions have been
   specified to solve this issue. One of these solutions is Intserv over 
   Diffserv [RFC2998] including resource-based admission control, 
   policy-based admission control, assistance in traffic 
   identification/classification, and traffic conditioning.  
   Intserv over Diffserv can operate over a statically provisioned 
   Diffserv region or RSVP aware. When it is RSVP aware, several 
   mechanisms may be used to support dynamic provisioning and topology-
   aware admission control, including aggregate RSVP reservations, per-
   flow RSVP, or a bandwidth broker.  
   [RFC3175] specifies aggregation of Resource ReSerVation 
   Protocol (RSVP) end-to-end reservations over aggregate RSVP 
   reservations. In [RFC3175] the RSVP aggregated reservation is 
   characterized by a RSVP SESSION object using the 3-tuple <source IP 
   address, destination IP address, Diffserv Code Point>.

   Several scenarios require the use of multiple generic aggregate 
   reservations that are established for a given PHB from a given source 
   IP address to a given destination IP address, see [RFC4860], 
   [SIG-NESTED].

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2012      

   For example, multiple generic aggregate reservations 
   can be applied in the situation that multiple e2e reservations using 
   different preemption priorities need to be aggregated through a PCN-
   domain using the same PHB. By using multiple aggregate reservations 
   for the same PHB allows enforcement of the different preemption 
   priorities within the aggregation region. This allows more efficient 
   management of the Diffserv resources, and in periods of resource 
   shortage, this allows sustainment of a larger number of E2E 
   reservations with higher preemption priorities. In particular, 
   [SIG-NESTED] discusses in detail how end-to-end RSVP reservations can 
   be established in a nested VPN environment through RSVP aggregation.

   [RFC4860] provides generic aggregate reservations by extending    
   [RFC3175] to support multiple aggregate reservations for the same 
   source IP address, destination IP address, and PHB (or set of PHBs).
   In particular, multiple such generic aggregate reservations can be 
   established for a given PHB from a given source IP address to a given 
   destination IP address. This is achieved by adding the concept of a 
   Virtual Destination Port and of an Extended Virtual Destination Port 
   in the RSVP SESSION object. In addition to this, the RSVP SESSION 
   object for generic aggregate reservations uses the PHB Identification 
   Code (PHB-ID) defined in [RFC3140], instead of using the Diffserv 
   Code Point (DSCP) used in [RFC3175]. The PHB-ID is used to identify 
   the PHB, or set of PHBs, from which the Diffserv resources are to be 
   reserved.  

   The main objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to support 
   the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv 
   domain in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion. Two mechanisms are 
   used: admission control, to decide whether to admit or block a new 
   flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances) flow termination to 
   decide whether to terminate some of the existing flows. To achieve 
   this, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the 
   PCN-domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain
   configured rates are exceeded.  These configured rates are below the
   rate of the link thus providing notification to PCN-boundary-nodes
   about incipient overloads before any congestion occurs (hence the
   "pre" part of "pre-congestion notification"). The level of marking
   allows decisions to be made about whether to admit or terminate PCN-
   flows.

   The PCN-egress-nodes measure the rates of differently marked 
   PCN-traffic in periodic intervals and report these rates to the 
   decision points for admission control and flow termination, based on 
   which they take their decisions. The decision points may be 
   collocated with the PCN-ingress-nodes or their function may be 
   implemented in a centralized node. For more details see [RFC5559], 
   [RFC6661], [RFC6662]. In this document it is considered that the 
   decision point is collocated with the PCN-ingress-node.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2012      

   This document follows the PCN signaling requirements defined in 
   [RFC6663] and specifies the 
   extensions to the Generic Aggregated RSVP [RFC4860] for the support 
   of PCN edge behaviors as specified in [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. 
   Moreover, this document specifies how RSVP aggregation can be used to 
   setup and maintain: (1) Ingress Egress Aggregate (IEA) states at 
   Ingress and Egress nodes and (2) generic aggregation of RSVP end-to-
   end RSVP reservations over PCN (Congestion and Pre-Congestion 
   Notification) domains. 
   
   This document, and according to [RFC4860] MAY also be used end-to-end 
   directly by end-systems attached to a Diffserv network.
   Furthermore, this document and according to [RFC4860], in absence of 
   e2e RSVP flows, a variety of policies (not defined in this document) 
   can be used at the Aggregator to set the DSCP of packets passing into 
   the aggregation region and how they are mapped onto generic aggregate
   reservations. These policies are not described in this document but 
   are a matter of local configuration.

   In this document it is considered that the PCN-nodes MUST be able to 
   support the functionality specified in [RFC5670], [RFC5559], 
   [RFC6660], [RFC6661], [RFC6662]. Furthermore, the PCN-boundary-nodes 
   MUST support the RSVP generic aggregated reservation procedures 
   specified in [RFC4860] which are augmented with procedures specified 
   in this document.

1.1.  Terminology 

   This document uses terms defined in [RFC4860], [RFC3175], [RFC5559], 
   [RFC5670], [RFC6661], [RFC6662].

   For readability, a number of definitions from [RFC3175] as well as
   definitions for terms used in [RFC5559], [RFC6661], and [RFC6662] are 
   provided here, where some of them are augmented with new meanings:

   Aggregator       This is the process in (or associated with) the
                    router at the ingress edge of the aggregation region
                    (with respect to the end-to-end RSVP reservation)
                    and behaving in accordance with [RFC4860].  In this
                    document, it is also the PCN-ingress-node and the 
                    decision point.

   Deaggregator     This is the process in (or associated with) the
                    router at the egress edge of the aggregation region
                    (with respect to the end-to-end RSVP reservation)
                    and behaving in accordance with [RFC4860].  In this
                    document, it is also the PCN-egress-node.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2012      

   E2E Reservation  This is an RSVP reservation such that:

                    (i)   corresponding RSVP Path messages are initiated
                          upstream of the Aggregator and terminated
                          downstream of the Deaggregator, and

                    (ii)  corresponding RSVP Resv messages are initiated
                          downstream of the Deaggregator and terminated
                          upstream of the Aggregator, and

                    (iii) this RSVP reservation is aggregated over an
                          Ingress Egress Aggregate (IEA) between the 
                          Aggregator and Deaggregator. 
                    An E2E RSVP reservation may be a per-flow
                    reservation, which in this document is only 
                    maintained at the PCN-ingress-node and PCN-egress-
                    node. Alternatively, the E2E reservation may itself 
                    be an aggregate reservation of various types (e.g., 
                    Aggregate IP reservation, Aggregate IPsec
                    reservation, see [RFC4860]).  As per regular RSVP 
                    operations, E2E RSVP  reservations are 
                    unidirectional.

   PHB-ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code)
                     A 16-bit field containing the Per Hop Behavior 
                     Identification Code of the PHB, or of the set of 
                     PHBs, from which Diffserv resources
                     are to be reserved.  This field MUST be encoded as 
                     specified in Section 2 of [RFC3140].

   VDstPort (Virtual Destination Port)

                     A 16-bit identifier used in the SESSION that 
                     remains constant over the life of the generic 
                     aggregate reservation.

   Extended vDstPort (Extended Virtual Destination Port)

                     An identifier used in the SESSION that remains 
                     constant over the life of the generic aggregate 
                     reservation. The length of this idenitifier is 32-
                     bits when IPv4 addresses are used and 128 bits when 
                     IPv6 addresses are used. A sender(or Aggregator) 
                     that wishes to narrow the scope of a SESSION to the 
                     sender-receiver pair (or Aggregator-Deaggregator 
                     pair) SHOULD place its IPv4 or IPv6 address here as 
                     a network unique identifier. A sender (or 
                     Aggregator) that wishes to use a common session 
                     with other senders (or Aggregators) in order to use 
                     a shared reservation across senders (or 
                     Aggregators) MUST set this field to all zeros. In 
                     this document, the Extended vDstPort SHOULD contain 
                     the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the Aggregator.

                    uses the PCN mechanisms to carry PCN-traffic, and 
                    the corresponding packets are PCN-packets.  
                    The same network will carry traffic of other 
                    Diffserv BAs.  The PCN-BA is

                    address, destination address, protocol id, and 
                    source port, destination port (where applicable).

  e2e microflow     a microflow where its associated packets are being 
                    forwarded on an E2E path.

   PCN-flow:        the unit of PCN-traffic that the PCN-boundary-node 
                    admits (or terminates); the unit could be a single 
                    e2e microflow (as defined in [RFC2474]) or some 
                    identifiable collection of microflows.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2012      

RSVP generic aggregated reservation: an RSVP reservation that is  
                    identified by using the RSVP SESSION object 
                    for generic RSVP aggregate reservation. This RSVP 
                    SESSION object is based on the RSVP SESSION object 
                    specified in [RFC4860] augmented with the following 
                    information:

                    o) the IPv4 DestAddress, IPv6 DestAddress SHOULD be 
                       set to the IPv4 or IPv6 destination addresses, 
                       respectively, of the Deaggregator (PCN-egress-
                       node)

                    o) PHB-ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code) 
                       SHOULD be set equal to PCN-compatible Diffserv 
                       codepoint(s).

                    o) Extended vDstPort SHOULD be set to the IPv4 or 
                       IPv6 destination addresses, of the Aggregator 
                       (PCN-ingress-node)

  Ingress-egress-aggregate (IEA): 
                    The collection of PCN-packets from all PCN-flows 
                    that travel in one direction between a specific pair 
                    of PCN-boundary-nodes. An ingress-
                    egress-aggregate is identified by the 
                    combination of (1) fields), (2) IP addresses of the 
                    specific pair of PCN-boundary-nodes used by a 
                    ingress-egress-aggregate. In this document one RSVP 
                    generic aggregated reservation is mapped to only one 
                    ingress-egress-aggregate, while one ingress-egress-
                    aggregate is mapped to either one or to more than 
                    one RSVP generic aggregated reservations. 

   PCN-admission-state
                    The state ("admit" or "block") derived by the 
                    Decision Point for a given ingress-egress-aggregate 
                    based on statistics about PCN-packet marking.  The 
                    Decision Point decides to admit or block new flows 
                    offered to the aggregate based on the current value 
                    of the PCN-admission-state.  

   Congestion level estimate (CLE)
                    The ratio of PCN-marked to total PCN-traffic 
                    (measured in octets) received for a given ingress-
                    egress-aggregate during a given measurement period.  
                    The CLE is used to derive the PCN-admission-state  
                    and is also used by the report suppression procedure    
                    if report suppression is activated.


   t_meas
                   A configurable time interval that defines the 
                   measurement period over which the PCN-egress-node 
                   collects statistics relating to PCN-traffic marking.

  t_maxsuppress
                   A configurable time interval after which the 
                   PCN-egress-node MUST send a report to the Decision 
                   Point for a given ingress-egress-aggregate regardless 
                   of the most recent values of the CLE.  This
                   mechanism provides the Decision Point with a periodic 
                   confirmation of liveness when report suppression is 
                   activated.  

   t_fail
                   An interval after which the Decision Point concludes 
                   That communication from a given PCN-egress-node has 
                   failed if it has received no reports from the 
                   PCN-egress-node during that interval.

   t_crit
                    A configurable interval used in the calculation of 
                    T_fail.  

   t-recvFail

                    An ingress-egress-aggregate timer that is used at 
                    The Decision point (in this document at the PCN-
                    ingress-node) which when expires raises an alarm to 
                    management, and activates the PCN-ingress-node to 
                    block the admission of new PCN-flows. This timer 
                    expires when it value is equal to T-fail and is 
                    reset when a report, i.e., RSVP aggregated RESV 
                    message, is received for a RSVP generic aggregated 
                    reservation (which is matched to one 
                    ingress-egress-aggregate).

2.  Overview of RSVP extensions and Operations 

2.1 Overview of RSVP Aggregation Procedures in PCN domains

   The PCN-boundary-nodes, see Figure 1, can support RSVP SESSIONS for 
   generic aggregated reservations {RFC4860], which are depending on 
   ingress-egress-aggregates. In particular, one RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservation matches to only one ingress-egress-aggregate. 
   However, one ingress-egress-aggregate matches to either 
   one or to more than one RSVP generic aggregated reservations. 
   In addition, in this document it is considered that the PCN-boundary
   nodes are able to distinguish and process (1) RSVP SESSIONS for 
   generic aggregated sessions and their messages according to 
   [RFC4860], (2) e2e RSVP sessions and messages according to [RFC2205].     
   Furthermore, it is considered that the PCN-interior-nodes are not 
   able to distinguish neither RSVP generic aggregated sessions and 
   their associated messages [RFC4860], nor e2e RSVP sessions and their 
   associated messages [RFC2205].

               in PCN domains, based on [RFC4860]

   Moreover, each Aggregator and Deaggregator (i.e., PCN-boundary-nodes)  
   MUST support policies to initiate and maintain for each pair of 
   PCN-boundary-nodes of the same PCN-domain (1) one ingress-egress-
   aggregate and (2) either one or more RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservations.  Note that one RSVP generic aggregated reservation 
   matches to only one ingress-egress-aggregate, while one ingress-
   egress-aggregate matches to either one or to more than one RSVP 
   generic aggregated reservations. This can be accomplished by using 
   for the different RSVP generic aggregated reservations the same 
   combinations of ingress and egress identifiers, but with a different 
   PHB-ID value (see [RFC4860]). 
   Depending on a policy the Aggregator SHOULD be able to decide whether 
   an e2e microflow (i.e., PCN-flow) can be mapped into (1) one RSVP 
   generic aggregated reservation and (2) one ingress-egress-aggregate 
   maintained by the Aggregator (i.e., PCN-ingress-node). Note that each 
   RSVP generic aggregated reservation is identified by using the RSVP 
   SESSION object [RFC4860]. The RSVP SESSION object for generic 
   aggregate reservations is based on the RSVP SESSION object specified 
   in [RFC4860] augmented with the following information:

    o) the IPv4 DestAddress, IPv6 DestAddress SHOULD be set to the IPv4 
       or IPv6 destination addresses, respectively, of the Deaggregator 
      (PCN-egress-node)

    o) PHB-ID (Per Hop Behavior Identification Code) SHOULD be set equal 
       to PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint(s).

    o) Extended vDstPort SHOULD be set to the IPv4 or IPv6 destination 
       addresses, of the Aggregator (PCN-ingress-node)

2.1.1   PCN Marking and encoding and transport of pre-congestion 
        information

   The method of PCN marking within the PCN domain is based on 
   [RFC5670]. In addition, the method of encoding and transport of pre-
   congestion information is based [RFC6660]. The PHB-ID (Per Hop 
   Behavior Identification Code) used, SHOULD be set equal 
   to PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint(s).

2.1.2.  Traffic Classification Within The Aggregation Region

   The PCN-traffic is marked using PCN-marking and is classified using 
   The PCN-BA (i.e., combination of the DSCP and ECN fields). 
   The PCN-traffic (e.g., e2e microflows) belonging to an ingress-
   egress-aggregate can be classified only at the PCN-boundary-nodes 
   using the combination of (1) PCN-BA (i.e., combination of the DSCP 
   and ECN fields), (2) IP addresses of the specific pair of PCN-
   boundary-nodes used by a ingress-egress-aggregate. 
   The method of classification and traffic conditioning of PCN-traffic  
   and non-PCN traffic and PHB configuration is described in [RFC6661] 
   and [RFC6662]. Moreover, the PCN-traffic (e.g., e2e microflows) 
   belonging to a RSVP generic aggregated reservation can be classified 
   only at the PCN-boundary-nodes (i.e., Aggregator and Deaggregator) by 
   using the RSVP SESSION object for RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservations, see [RFC4860].

2.1.3.  Deaggregator (PCN-egress-node) Determination

   In this document it is considered that for the determination of the 
   Deaggregator, the same methods can be used as the ones described in 
   [RFC4860].  

2.1.4.  Mapping E2E Reservations Onto Aggregate Reservations

   In this document it is considered that for the mapping of e2e 
   reservations onto aggregate reservations, the same methods can be 
   used as the ones described in [RFC4860], augmented by the following 
   rules:

   o) PCN-ingress-node MUST use one or more policies to estimate whether 
      an e2e RSVP reservation session associated with an e2e Path 
      message that arrives at the external interface of the PCN-ingress-
      node can be mapped onto an existing RSVP generic aggregation 
      reservation state.

2.1.5.  Size of Aggregate Reservations

   In this document it is considered that for the determination of the 
   size of the RSVP generic aggregate reservations, the same methods can 
   be used as the ones described in [RFC4860].

   In this document it is considered that for the update of the e2e Path 
   ADSPEC, the same methods can be used as the ones described in 
   [RFC4860].

2.1.7.  Intra-domain Routes

   The PCN-interior-nodes are neither maintaining e2e RSVP nor RSVP   
   generic aggregation states and reservations. Therefore, intra-domain 
   route changes will not affect intra-domain reservations since such 
   reservations are not maintained by the PCN-interior-nodes. 

2.1.8.  Inter-domain Routes

   In this document it is considered that for the solving the issues 
   caused by the inter-domain route changes, the same methods can be 
   used as the ones described in [RFC4860].


2.1.9.  Reservations for Multicast Sessions

   PCN does not consider reservations for multicast sessions. 

2.1.10.  Multi-level Aggregation

   PCN does not consider multi-level aggregations within the PCN domain. 

2.1.11.  Reliability Issues

   In this document it is considered that for solving possible 
   reliability issues, the same methods can be used as the ones 
   described in [RFC4860].

2.1.12.  Message Integrity and Node Authentication

   In this document it is considered that for message integrity and node 
   authentication, the same methods can be used as the ones described in 
   [RFC4860] and [RFC5559].

3. Elements of Procedure

   This section describes the procedures used to implement the 
   aggregated RSVP procedure over PCN. 

3.1.  Receipt of E2E Path Message By PCN-ingress-node (aggregating
      router)

   When the e2e RSVP message arrives at the exterior interface of the 
   Aggregator, i.e., PCN-ingress-node, then standard RSVP generic 
   aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used, augmented with the 
   following rules:


Karagiannis, et al.   Expires April 12, 2013                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2012      

     o) The e2e RSVP reservation session associated with an e2e Path 
        message that arrives at the external interface of the PCN-
        ingress-node is mapped/matched onto an existing RSVP generic 
        aggregation reservation state.

     o) If the timer t-recvFail expires for a given PCN-egress-node, the 
        Decision Point (i.e., PCN-ingress-node) SHOULD NOT  
        allow the e2e microflow (i.e., PCN-flow) to be admitted to that 
        RSVP generic aggregated reservation (which is matched to one 
        ingress-egress-aggregate). The admission or rejection procedure 
        of a PCN-flow into the PCN-domain is defined in detail in: 
        [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. 
        If the Aggregator is not able to admit the e2e microflow it 
        SHOULD then generate an e2e PathErr message using standard e2e 
        RSVP procedures [RFC4495]. This e2e PathErr message is sent to 
        the originating sender of the e2e Path message. A new error code  
        "PCN-domain rejects e2e reservation" MUST be augmented to the 
        RSVP error codes to inform the sender that a PCN domains rejects 
        the e2e reservation request.

     o) If the timer t-recvFail does NOT expire for a given PCN-egress-
        node, then: 

         o) If (1) the PCN-admission state for the ingress-egress-
            aggregate associated with the received e2e Path and (2) the 
            state for the selected RSVP generic aggregated reservation, 
            see [RFC4860], are "admit", the Decision Point (i.e., PCN-
            ingress-node) SHOULD allow the new flow to be admitted to 
            that RSVP generic aggregated reservation. The e2e Path 
            message is then forwarded towards destination.

         o) If for the same ingress-egress-aggregated and the same RSVP 
            generic aggregated reservation then (1) the PCN-admission-
            state and/or (2) the state for the RSVP generic aggregated 
            reservation are/is "block", the flow SHOULD NOT be 
            admitted by the Aggregator and an e2e PathErr message SHOULD 
            be generated, using standard e2e RSVP procedures  
            [RFC4495]. This e2e PathErr message is sent to the 
            originating sender of the e2e Path message, using standard 
            e2e RSVP procedures [RFC2205], [RFC4495]. A new error code 
            "PCN-domain rejects e2e reservation" MUST be augmented to 
            the RSVP error codes to inform the sender that a PCN domains 
            rejects the e2e reservation request.

   The way of how the PCN-admission-state is maintained is specified in
   [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]. The way of how the RSVP generic aggregated 
   reservation state is maintained is specified in [RFC4860]. 

3.2.  Handling Of E2E Path Message By Interior Routers

   The e2e Path messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-nodes.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2012      

   The PCN-interior-nodes receive the e2e Path message on an interior 
   interface and forward it on another interior interface. The e2e Path 
   messages are simply forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 

3.3.  Receipt of E2E Path Message By PCN-egress-node (deaggregating
      router)

   When receiving the e2e Path message the PCN-egress-node  
   (Deaggregator) performs main regular [RFC4860] procedures, augmented 
   with the following rules, see also [draft-lefaucheur-rsvp-ecn-01]: 

      o) The PCN-egress-node MUST NOT perform the RSVP-TTL vs IP TTL-
         check and MUST NOT update the ADspec Break bit. This is because 
         the whole PCN-domain is effectively handled by e2e RSVP as a 
         virtual link on which integrated service is indeed supported 
         (and admission control performed) so that the Break bit MUST 
         NOT be set.

    The PCN-egress-nodes forwards the e2e Path message towards the 
    receiver.

3.4.  Initiation of new Aggregate Path Message By PCN-ingress-node 
      (Aggregating Router)

   In this document it is considered that for the initiation of the new 
   RSVP aggregated Path message by the PCN-ingress-node (Aggregator), 
   the same methods can be used as the ones described in [RFC4860]. 

3.5.  Handling Of new Aggregate Path Message By Interior Routers

   The Aggregate Path messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-nodes. 
   The PCN-interior-nodes receive the e2e Path message on an interior 
   interface and forward it on another interior interface. The 
   Aggregated Path messages are simply forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 

3.6.  Handling of E2E Resv Message by Deaggregating Router

   When the e2e Resv message arrives at the exterior interface of the 
   Deaggregator, i.e., PCN-egress-node, then standard RSVP 
   aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used.

3.7.  Handling Of E2E Resv Message By Interior Routers

   The e2e Resv messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-nodes. The 
   PCN-interior-nodes receive the e2e Resv message on an interior 
   interface and forward it on another interior interface. The e2e Resv 
   messages are simply forwarded as normal IP datagrams. 

3.8.  Initiation of New Aggregate Resv Message By Deaggregating Router

   In this document it is considered that for the initiation of the new 
   RSVP aggregated Resv message by the PCN-ingress-node (Aggregator), 
   the same methods can be used as the ones described in [RFC4860] 
   augmented with the following rules:

     o) At the end of each t-meas measurement interval, or less 
        frequently if "optional report suppression" is activated, see 
        [RFC6661], and [RFC6662], the PCN-egress-node MUST include the 
        new PCN object that will be sent to the associated Decision 
        Point (i.e., PCN-ingress-node). The PCN object is specified in 
        this document and is used for the report of the data measured by 
        the PCN-egress-node, for a particular ingress-egress-aggregate, 
        see [RFC6661], and [RFC6662]. The address of the PCN-ingress-
        node is the one specified in the same ingress-egress-aggregate.

3.9.  Handling of Aggregate Resv Message by Interior Routers

   The Aggregated Resv messages traverse zero or more PCN-interior-
   nodes. The PCN-interior-nodes receive the Aggregated Resv message on 
   an interior interface and forward it on another interior interface. 
   The Aggregated Resv messages are simply forwarded as normal IP 
   datagrams. 

3.10.  Handling of E2E Resv Message by Aggregating Router

   When the e2e Resv message arrives at the interior interface of the 
   Aggregating router, i.e., PCN-ingress-node, then standard RSVP 
   aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used.

3.11.  Handling of Aggregated Resv Message by Aggregating Router

   When the Aggregated Resv message arrives at the interior interface of 
   the Aggregating router, i.e., PCN-ingress-node, then standard RSVP 
   aggregation [RFC4860] procedures are used, augmented with the 
   following rules: 

     o) the Decision Point (i.e., the PCN-ingress-node) SHOULD use the 
        information carried by the PCN objects as specified in 
        [RFC6661], [RFC6662]. When the Aggregator (i.e., 
        PCN-ingress-node) needs to terminate an amount of traffic 
        associated to one ingress-egress-aggregate (see bullet 2 in 
        Section 3.3.2 of [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]), then several 
        procedures of terminating e2e microflows can be deployed. The 
        default procedure of terminating e2e microflows (i.e., 
        PCN-flows) is as follows, see e.g., [RFC6661]. For the same 
        ingress-egress-aggregate, select a number of e2e microflows 
        to be terminated in order to decrease the total incoming amount 
        of bandwidth associated with one ingress-egress-aggregate by the 
        amount of traffic to be terminated, see above. 
        In this situation the same mechanisms for terminating an e2e 
        microflow can be followed as specified in [RFC2205]. 
        However, based on a local policy, the Aggregator could use 
        other procedures of terminating microflows.

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2012      

        For example, for the same ingress-egress-aggregate, select a 
        number of e2e microflows to be terminated or to reduce their  
        reserved bandwidth in order to decrease the total incoming 
        amount of bandwidth associated with one ingress-egress-aggregate 
        by the amount of traffic to be terminated. In this 
        situation the same mechanisms for terminating an e2e microflow 
        or reducing bandwidth associated with an e2e microflow can be 
        followed as specified in [RFC4495].

3.12.  Removal of E2E Reservation

   In this document it is considered that for the removal of e2e 
   reservations, the same methods can be used as the ones described in 
   [RFC4860] and [RFC4495].

3.13.  Removal of Aggregate Reservation

   In this document it is considered that for the removal of RSVP 
   generic aggregated reservations, the same methods can be used as the    
   ones described in [RFC4860].

3.14.  Handling of Data On Reserved E2E Flow by Aggregating Router

   The handling of data on the reserved e2e Flow by Aggregating Router 
   is using the procedures described in [RFC4860] augmented with:

   o)  Regarding, PCN marking and traffic classification the procedures 
       defined in Section 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 of this document are used.

3.15.  Procedures for Multicast Sessions

   In this document no multicast sessions are considered.
   
4.  Protocol Elements

   The protocol elements in this document are using the protocol 
   Elements defined in [RFC4860], augmented with the following rules:

   o) A PCN-egress-node (i.e., Deaggregator) SHOULD send periodically 
      and at the end of each t-meas measurement interval, or less 
      frequently if "optional report suppression" is activated, an 
      (refresh) aggregated RSVP message to the PCN-ingress-node (i.e. 
      aggregator).

   o) the DSCP value included in the SESSION object, SHOULD be set equal 
      to a PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint. 

   o) An aggregated Resv message MUST carry one or more C-type PCN 
      objects, see Section 4.1, to report the data measured by an 
      PCN-egress-node (i.e., Deaggregator).

Internet-Draft       Aggregated RSVP over PCN           October 2012      

   o) As described in [RFC6661], [RFC6663], PCN reports  
      from the PCN-egress-node (Deaggregator) to the decision point may 
      contain flow identifiers for individual flows within an 
      ingress-egress-aggregate that have recently experienced 
      excess-marking. Hence, the PCN report messages used by the PCN CL 
      edge behavior MUST be capable of carrying sequences of octet 
      strings constituting such identifiers. When the PCN CL edge 
      behavior is used, the individual flow identifiers need to be 
      included in specific PCN objects, see Section 4.1 
      (C-Type = RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-CL-FLIDs,  
              = RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-CL-FLIDs)

4.1 PCN object

   The PCN object reports data measured by an PCN-egress-node. PCN 
   objects are defined for different PCN edge behavior drafts. This
   document defines several types of PCN objects.

   o) Single Marking (SM) PCN object, when IPv4 addresses are used:
      Class = PCN
      C-Type = RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv4-PCN-SM

      o) Length (1 byte): the length of the 
         RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-CL-FLIDs object in units of 40 bytes. 
         This field is used to specify the number of flow IDs carried by 
         this object. Each flow ID is represented by the combination of 
         each subsequent 5 tuple fields:
         Source address, Destination address, Source Port, 
         Destination Port and Protocol number.
         If Length is 0 then the RSVP-AGGREGATE-IPv6-PCN-CL-FLIDs object 
         is empty.
  
      o) Source address (16 bytes):  The IPv6 source address. 

      o) Destination address (16 bytes): The IPv6 destination address.

      o) Protocol (1 byte):  The IP protocol number. It refers to the 
          true upper layer protocol carried by the packets.

      o) Source Port (2 bytes): contains the source port number.

      o) Destination Port (2 bytes): contains the destination port 
         number.
    
5.  Security Considerations 
    
   The same security considerations specified in [RFC4860] and [RFC5559] 
   apply also to this document. 
    
    
6.  IANA Considerations  
    
   This document makes the following requests to the IANA: 
      o allocate a new Object Class (PCN Object), see Section 4.1. 

      o allocate a "PCN-domain rejects e2e reservation" Error Code that 
        may appear only in e2e PathErr messages, see Section 3.1.
