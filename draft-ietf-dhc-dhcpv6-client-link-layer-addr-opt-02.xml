    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification defines an optional mechanism and the related
      DHCPv6 option to allow first hop DHCPv6 relay agent directly connected
      to the client to populate client link-layer address in the DHCPv6
      messages being sent towards the server.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Problem Background and Scenario">
      <t>DHCPv4 protocol specification <xref target="RFC2131"/> provides a way
      to specify the client hardware address in the DHCPv4 message header.
      DHCPv4 message header has 'htype' and 'chaddr' fields to specify client
      hardware address type and hardware address respectively. The client
      hardware address thus learnt can be used by DHCPv4 server and relay in
      different ways. In some of the deployments DHCPv4 servers use 'chaddr'
      as a customer identifier and a key for lookup in the client lease
      database.</t>

      <t>With the incremental deployment of IPv6 to existing IPv4 networks,
      effectively an enablement of dual-stack, there will be devices that act
      as both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients. In service provider deployments, a
      typical DHCPv4 implementation will use the client hardware address as
      one of the keys to build DHCP client lease database. In dual stack
      scenarios it is desirable for the operator to associate DHCPv4 and
      DHCPv6 messages as belonging to the same client interface based on an
      identifier that is already used by that operator such as the client
      hardware address.</t>

      <t>Currently, the DHCPv6 protocol specification <xref target="RFC3315"/>
      does not define a way for DHCP clients to specify client link-layer
      address in the DHCPv6 message sent towards DHCPv6 Server. Similarly
      DHCPv6 Relay or Server cannot glean client link-layer address from the
      contents of DHCPv6 message received. DHCPv6 protocol specification
      mandates all clients to prepare and send DUID as the client identifier
      option in all the DHCPv6 message exchange. However none of these methods
      provide a simple way to extract client's link-layer address. This
      presents a problem to an operator who is using an existing DHCPv4 system
      with the client hardware address as the customer identifier, and desires
      to correlate DHCPv6 assignments using the same identifier. Modifying the
      system to use DUID based correlation across DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 is
      possible, but it requires a modification of the DHCPv4 system and
      associated back-ends.</t>

      <t>Providing an option in DHCPv6 relay forward messages to carry client
      link-layer address explicitly will help above mentioned scenarios. For
      e.g. it can be used along with other identifiers to associate DHCPv4 and
      DHCPv6 messages from a dual stack client. Further, having client
      link-layer address in DHCPv6 will help in proving additional information
      in event debugging and logging related to the client at relay and
      server. The proposed option may be used in wide range of networks, two
      notable deployment models are service provider and enterprise network
      environments.</t>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior">
      <t>DHCPv6 Relay agents which receive messages originating from clients
      (for example Solicit and Request, but not, for example, Relay Forward or
      Advertise) MAY include the link-layer source address of the received
      DHCPv6 message in Client Link-layer Address option in relayed DHCPv6
      Relay Forward messages. The DHCPv6 Relay agent behavior can depend on
      configuration that decides whether Client Link-layer Address option
      needs to be processed and included.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>If DHCPv6 Server is configured to store or use client link-layer
      address, it SHOULD look for the client link-layer address option in the
      RELAY-FORW DHCP message of the DHCPv6 Relay agent closest to the client.
      This specification does not specify the mechanism for DHCPv6 Server to
      find out link-layer address of the directly connected clients as a DHCP
      option as it can obtain it directly from the received message.</t>

      <t>There is no requirement that a server return this option and its data
      in a downstream DHCP message.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to assign an option code to
      OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR from the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options"
      registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-
      parameters.xml).</t>
