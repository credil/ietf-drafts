	<section title="Introduction">
        <t>
        This draft describes the Management Information Base (MIB) module 
        for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
        Specifically, the MIB for managing Locator/ID Separation Protocol 
        (LISP) devices is described.
        </t>
        <t>
        LISP <xref target="LISP" /> specifies a network-based architecture 
        and mechanisms that implement a new semantic for IP addressing 
        using two separate name spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), used 
        within sites, and Routing Locators (RLOCs), used on the transit 
        networks that make up the Internet infrastructure.  To achieve this 
        separation, LISP defines protocol mechanisms for mapping from EIDs
        to RLOCs. 
        </t>
        <t>
        From a data plane perspective, LISP traffic is handled exclusively 
        at the network layer by devices performing Ingress Tunnel Router 
        (ITR) and Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) LISP functions.  Data plane 
        operations performed by these devices are described in 
        <xref target="LISP" />.  Additionally, data plane interworking 
        between legacy (Internet) and LISP sites is implemented by devices 
        performing Proxy ITR (PITR) and Proxy ETR (PETR) functions.  The 
        data plane operations of these devices is described in 
        <xref target="INTERWORK" />.
        </t>
        <t>
        From a control plane perspective, LISP employs mechanisms related 
        to creating, maintaining, and resolving mappings from EIDs to 
        RLOCs. LISP ITRs, ETRs, PITRs, and PETRs perform specific control 
        plane functions, and these control plane operations are described 
        in <xref target="LISP" />. Additionally, LISP infrastructure 
        devices supporting LISP control plane functionality include 
        Map-Servers and Map-Resolvers, and the control plane operations of 
        these devices are described in <xref target="LISP-MS" />.  Finally, 
        while not specifically required, this document assumes the 
        existence of a database to store and propagate those mappings 
        globally.

        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol 
        (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms 
        defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This 
        memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which 
        is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"></xref>, 
        STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"></xref> and STD 58,

    <section title="Definition of Terms">
    <t>
    <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Endpoint ID (EID):">a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit 
        (for IPv6) value used in the source and destination address fields 
        of the first (inner-most) IP header of a LISP packet.  A source EID 
        is allocated to a host from an EID-prefix block associated with the 
        site where the host is located.  A host determines a destination 
        address in the same way that it determines a destination address 
        today, for example through a DNS lookup or SIP exchange.
        </t>
        <t hangText="Routing Locator (RLOC):">a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 
        128-bit (for IPv6) value used in the source and destination address 
        fields of the second (outer-most) IP header of a LISP packet.  RLOC 
        addresses are allocated to an egress tunnel router (ETR) and 
        numbered from topologically-aggregatable blocks assigned to a site 
        at each point to which it attaches to the global Internet.
        </t>
        <t hangText="EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache:">a short-lived, on-demand table 
        maintained locally in an ITR or PITR that stores, tracks, and is 
        responsible for timing-out and otherwise validating EID-to-RLOC 
        mappings.  This table is distinct from the full "database" of 
        EID-to-RLOC mappings in that it is dynamic and relatively small. 
        At a given moment in time, it consists only of entries for those 
        sites to which the ITR or PITR is currently communicating or has 
        communicated with within the configured TTL period. 
        </t>
        <t hangText="EID-to-RLOC Mapping-Database:">a global distributed 
        database that contains all known EID-to-RLOC mappings.  Each 
        potential ETR typically contains a small piece of the database 
        consisting of only the EID-to-RLOC mappings for the EID prefix(es) 
        for which the ETR is "authoritative" and the RLOC(s) by which those 
        EID prefix(es) are reachable from the global Internet.
        </t>
        <t hangText="Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR):">a router that accepts 
        an IP packet with a single IP header (more precisely, an IP packet 
        that does not contain a LISP header), treats this "inner" 
        IP destination address as an EID and performs an EID-to-RLOC mapping 
        lookup, and then prepends an "outer" IP header with one of its own 
        globally-routable RLOCs in the source address field and the RLOC 
        resulting from the mapping lookup in the destination address field. 
        That is, in general an ITR receives an IP packet from site 
        end-systems on one side and sends a LISP-encapsulated IP packet 
        toward the Internet on the other side.
        </t>
        <t hangText="Egress Tunnel Router (ETR):">a router that accepts an 
        IP packet where the destination address in the "outer" IP header is 
        one of its own RLOCs, strips the "outer" header, and forwards the 
        packet based on the next IP header found.  That is, in general an 
        ETR receives LISP-encapsulated IP packets from the Internet on one 
        side and sends decapsulated IP packets toward site end-systems on 
        the other side.
        </t>
        <t hangText="xTR:">a term of general reference to an ITR or ETR 
        when direction of data flow is not part of the context description. 
        xTR refers to the router that is the tunnel endpoint and performs 
        both ITR and ETR functionality.  For example, "An xTR can be 
        located at the Customer Edge (CE) router," meaning both ITR and 
        ETR functionality is activated at the CE router.
        </t>
        <t hangText="Proxy ITR (PITR):">a router that acts like an ITR but 
        does so on behalf of non-LISP sites which send packets to 
        destinations at LISP sites.  The PITR, also known as a PTR, is 
        defined and described in <xref target="INTERWORK" />.
        </t>
        <t hangText="Proxy ETR (PETR):">a router that acts like an ETR but 
        does so on behalf of LISP sites which send packets to destinations 
        at non-LISP sites.  The PETR is defined and described in 
        <xref target="INTERWORK" />.
        </t>
        <t hangText="LISP Site:">a set of routers in an edge network 
        that are under a single technical administration.  LISP routers 
        which reside in the edge network are the demarcation points to 
        separate the edge network from the core network.
        </t>
        <t hangText="Map-Server:">a LISP network infrastructure component 
        which learns EID-to-RLOC mapping entries from an authoritative 
        source such as an ETR though static configuration, or another 
        out-of-band mechanism.  A Map-Server advertises these mappings 
        into the distributed mapping database. 
        </t>
        <t hangText="Map-Resolver:">a LISP network infrastructure component 
        which accepts LISP Encapsulated Map-Requests, typically from an 
        ITR, and quickly determines whether or not the destination IP 
        address is part of the EID namespace. If it is, the Map-Resolver 
        finds the appropriate EID-to-RLOC mapping by consulting the 
        distributed mapping database.  If it is not, a Negative Map-Reply 
        is immediately returned.
        </t>
        <t hangText="Map-Request:">a LISP Map-Request message type sent 
        by an ITR or PITR to a Map-Resolver when it needs a mapping for 
        an EID, wants to test an RLOC for reachability, or wants to 
        refresh a mapping before TTL expiration.
		</t>
        <t hangText="Map-Reply:">a LISP Map-Reply message type returned in 
        response to a Map-Request for a destination EID that exists in the 
        mapping database and contains the locator-set and associated policy 
        for the queried EID. Information returned in a Map-Reply is stored 
        in the EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache.
		</t>
        <t hangText="Negative Map-Reply:">a LISP Map-Reply message type 
        that contains an empty locator-set. Returned in response to a 
        Map-Request if the destination EID does not exist in the mapping 
        database. Typically, this means that the "EID" being requested is 
        an IP address connected to a non-LISP site. Information returned 
        in a Negative Map-Reply is stored in the EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache.

	<section title="LISP MIB Objectives">
        <t>
        The objectives for defining this LISP MIB module are as follows:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t> 
            Provide a means for obtaining a list of enabled LISP features
            and the current status of configuration attributes related to
            those features.  As an example, LISP capabilities which could
            be enabled include ITR, ETR, PITR, PETR, MS or MR support for 
            IPv4 or IPv6 address families.  Other examples include, 
            indicating whether rloc-probing is enabled, and indicating 
            the configured map-cache limit value. 
            </t>
            <t> 
            Provide a means for obtaining the current attributes of 
            various LISP tables, such as the EID-to-RLOC policy data 
            contained in the Map-Cache, or the local EID-to-RLOC policy 
            data contained in the Mapping-Database. 
            </t>
            <t> 
            Provide a means for obtaining the current operational 
            statistics of various LISP functions, such as the number of 
            packets encapsulated and decapsulated by the device.  Other 
            counters of operational interest, depending on LISP function, 
            include things like the current number of map-cache entries, 
            and the total number and rate of map-requests received and 
            sent.

LispAddressType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "39a"
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "LISP architecture can be applied to a wide variety of
         address-families. This textual-convention is a
         generalization for representing addresses that belong to those 
         address-families. For convenience, this document refers to any 
         such address as a LISP address. LispAddressType 
         textual-convention consists of the following four-tuple:
          1. IANA Address Family Number: A field of length 2-octets, 
             whose value is of the form following the assigned 
             AddressFamilyNumbers textual-convention described in 
             [IANA]. The enumerations are listed in [IANA].  Note that 
             this list of address family numbers is maintained by IANA.
          2. Length of LISP address: A field of length 1-octet, whose 
             value indicates the octet-length of the next (third) field 
             of this LispAddressType four-tuple.
          3. LISP address: A field of variable length as indicated in 
             the previous (second) field, whose value is an address of 
             the IANA Address Family indicated in the first field of 
             this LispAddressType four-tuple.  Note that any of the 
             IANA Address Families can be represented. Particularly 
             when the address family is LISP Canonical Address Format
             (LCAF) [LCAF] with IANA assigned Address Family Number 
             16387, then the first octet of this field indicates the 
             LCAF type, and the rest of this field is same as the 
             encoding format of the LISP Canonical Address after the 
             length field, as defined in [LCAF].
          4. Mask-length of address: A field of length 1-octet, whose 
             value is the mask-length to be applied to the LISP 
             address specified in the previous (third) field.

          To illustrate the use of this object, consider the LISP MIB 
          Object below entitled lispMapCacheEntry. This object begins 
          with the following entities:

          lispMapCacheEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
             lispMapCacheEidLength          INTEGER,
             lispMapCacheEid                LispAddressType,
              ... [skip] ...

          Example 1: Suppose that the IPv4 EID prefix stored is
          10.10.10.0/24. In this case, the values within
          lispMapCacheEntry would be:

             lispMapCacheEidLength  = 8
             lispMapCacheEid = 1, 4, 10.10.10.0, 24
             ... [skip] ...

          where 8 is the total length in octets of the next
          object (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType). Then,
          the value 1 indicates the IPv4 AF (per [IANA]), the
          value 4 indicates that the AF is 4-octets in length,
          10.10.10.0 is the IPv4 address, and the value 24 is the
          mask-length in bits. Note that the lispMapCacheEidLength
          value of 8 is used to compute the length of the fourth
          (last) field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet - as
          computed by 8 - (2 + 1 + 4) = 1.

          Example 2: Suppose that the IPv6 EID prefix stored is
          2001:db8:a::/48. In this case, the values within
          lispMapCacheEntry would be:

             lispMapCacheEidLength  = 20
             lispMapCacheEid = 2, 16, 2001:db8:a::, 48
             ... [skip] ...

          where 20 is the total length in octets of the next
          object (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType). Then,
          the value 2 indicates the IPv4 AF (per [IANA]), the
          value 16 indicates that the AF is 16-octets in length,
          2001:db8:a:: is the IPv6 address, and the value 48 is the
          mask-length in bits. Note that the lispMapCacheEidLength
          value of 20 is used to compute the length of the fourth
          (last) field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet - as
          computed by 20 - (2 + 1 + 16) = 1.

          Example 3: As an example where LCAF is used, suppose
          that the IPv4 EID prefix stored is 10.10.10.0/24 and it
          is part of LISP Instance ID 101. In this case, the values
          within lispMapCacheEntry would be:

             lispMapCacheEidLength  = 11
             lispMapCacheEid = 16387, 7, 2, 101, 1, 10.10.10.0, 24
             ... [skip] ...

          where 11 is the total length in octets of the next object
          (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType). Then, the value
          16387 indicates the LCAF AF (see [IANA]), the value 7
          indicates that the LCAF AF is 7-octets in length in this
          case, 2 indicates that LCAF Type 2 encoding is used (see
          [LCAF]), 101 gives the Instance ID, 1 gives the AFI (per
          [IANA]) for an IPv4 address, 10.10.10.0 is the IPv4
          address, and 24 is the mask-length in bits. Note that the
          lispMapCacheEidLength value of 11 octets is used to compute
          the length of the last field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet,
          as computed by 11 - (2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4) = 1."

        <section title="MIB modules required for IMPORTS"> 
        <t>
        <!-- reference the IANA address family numbers MIB -->
        The LISP MIB imports the textual-convention AddressFamilyNumbers 
        from the IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB [IANA].
        </t>
        </section>
    </section>


    <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
    There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that 
    have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  As 
    long as these MIB modules are implemented correctly, there are 
    no risks that any management objects of this MIB module can 
    modify device settings via direct SNMP SET operations.
    </t>
    <t>
    There are no readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects 
    with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) that are considered 
    sensitive. 
    </t> 
    <t> 
    SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
    Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
    there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to 
    access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in 
    this MIB module.
    </t> 
    <t> 
    It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
    as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
    including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
    authentication and privacy).
    </t> 
    <t> 
    Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
    RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
    enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
    responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
    instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give access
    to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
    rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
    </t> 
    </section>

	<section title="IANA Considerations">
    <t>
    The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
    <figure>
    <preamble></preamble><artwork>
           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value

           lispMib            { mib-2 XXX }
    </artwork>
    <postamble></postamble>
    </figure>
    [Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
    requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
    to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
    assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
    (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
    this note.]
