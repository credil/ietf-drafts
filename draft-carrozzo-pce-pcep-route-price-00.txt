     PCEP extensions for the computation of route offers with price
                 draft-carrozzo-pce-pcep-route-price-00

Abstract

   The PCE defined in RFC4655 is a functional entity generally confined
   in the control plane to elaborate explicit optimal routes with
   related costs to be installed as [G]MPLS tunnels/LSPs.  The resulting
   route cost(s)/metric(s) are Traffic Engineering indicators used by
   the network administrator (carrier) to optimize the usage of its
   network resources.

   In this document a framework for the usage of PCE in cooperation with
   the Network Service and Business Plane (NSBP) is proposed, along with
   related PCEP extensions.  The NSBP invokes this extended PCE (service
   PCE) to trigger the computation of network service offers with
   related price information.  The price of a network connectivity
   service generally depends on strategic factors, but it could also be
   influenced by the amount of mobilized network resources (along the
   route), the ingress/egress interfaces/PoPs, etc.  Therefore, it could
   be provided by an extended service-PCE as an additional route
   information.

   This document focuses on the extensions to the PCEP protocol in
   support of the computation of route prices for intra- and inter-
   domain network connectivity services.  Mechanisms for elaborating and
   retrieving price information in the PCE are vendor-specific and out
   of the scope of this document.

1.  Introduction

   Carriers usually deploy traffic engineering (TE) technologies coupled
   with network control plane (CP) protocol suites, such as the Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS), to
   offer value added network connectivity services to their customers.

   The constraint-based route computation is a key function for these
   connectivity services, and it is executed by the Path Computation
   Element (PCE) functional entity.  The PCE architecture is defined in
   [RFC4655] and allows the computation of network routes based on a
   network graph; the graph is derived from the controlled network with
   various means (e.g.  IGP/EGP, other proprietary interfaces, etc.),
   and can contain multi-domain, multi-region/multi-layer topology
   information.

   In general, the PCE function is completely confined in the control
   plane to compute optimal inter-domain constrained explicit routes
   (ERO) for (G)MPLS TE LSPs/tunnels.  However, the computation and
   instantiation of these tunnels in the Transport Plane (TP) is
   preceded by mandatory phases of service/product offering, offer
   composition and negotiation, which involve the service supplier(s)
   and the final service end-customer (see TMF IPSPHERE Framework
   [IPSPHERE]).  These service phases are generally handled at the
   management and business planes (OSS/BSS) only.  However, control
   plane functionalities like the PCE ones can definitely support in the
   definition/specification of network connectivity offers within a
   carrier network domain.

   This document briefly introduces a framework for the usage of a PCE
   for route offers (Service-PCE) and describes some extensions to the
   PCEP protocol that allow the Network Service and Business Plane
   (NSBP) to request the Service-PCE for the computation of network
   service offers with related price information.

   Mechanisms for elaborating and retrieving price information in the
   Service-PCE are assumed to be vendor-specific and out of the scope of
   this I-D.

   BSS:  Business Support System.

   Control Plane (CP):  The CP performs the basic functions of
      signaling, routing and resource discovery.  These are essential
      operations which allow for the automation of higher-level network
      functions like connection establishment (i.e., path computation,
      resource availability, verification and connection set-up and
      tear-down), reconfiguration of signaled connections, and
      connection restoration.

   FCAPS:  Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security
      management.

   GMPLS:  Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   Management Plane:  The network management plane performs functions
      like alarm reporting, system configuration and connection
      provisioning for the network data and network control planes.  The
      complexity of the network management plane strongly depends on the
      capabilities of the network control plane.  In general the network
      management plane performs FCAPS functionalities (Fault,
      Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security management).
      Where applicable the network management plane follows the TMN
      architecture as described in [ITU-T M.3010].

   NMS:  Network Management System.

   Network Service and Business Plane (NSBP):  This plane refers to
      functions related to the management and handling of network
      product offerings, service specifications and service instances.
      This can range from service specification and offer creation, to
      their publishing, service instance request and handling.
      Functions of this plane may also include customer-relationship
      management and various functions related to operations support.

   OSS:  Operation Support System.

   Parent PCE:  As per [I-D.ietf-pce-hierarchy-fwk], a PCE responsible
      for selecting a path across a parent domain and any number of
      child domains by coordinating with child PCEs and examining a
      topology map that shows domain inter-connectivity.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

Internet-Draft               PCEP PRICE INFO                  March 2012


   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol.

   Service PCE:  A parent PCE interfaced to the NSBP for the computation
      of route offers with price information.  PCEP protocol is used to
      implement the interface between NSBP and the Service PCE.

   TE:  Traffic Engineering.

   TED:  Traffic Engineering Database.

   Transport Plane (TP):  The transport plane performs various framing,
      forwarding or switching, and the transportation of data blocks to
      specific destinations.  This plane identifies the set of data
      bearing transport resources (possibly grouped into domains on a
      policy or technology basis).


3.  Service-PCE framework

   The NSBP includes all the functions related to the management and
   handling of network connectivity product offers, service
   specifications and service instances from an operational and business
   perspective ([IPSPHERE] [ETICS]).  In particular, the NSBP controls/
   coordinates the service specification and offer creation, publishes
   these product offers, composes different offers for an end-to-end
   service, and eventually triggers the instantiation and operation of
   the final service

   The constraint-based route computation functions provided by a PCE
   can be very useful for the network connectivity offer creation.  In
   fact, the PCE can implement constraint-based route selection
   procedures providing the requesting client also with route price
   information tight to the route to be followed, the ingress/egress
   endpoints, some policy data, etc.

   A Path Computation Client (PCC) could be integrated in the NSBP, to
   request route offer computation either on-demand (i.e. connectivity
   offer tailored to a specific customer request at the NSBP interfaces)
   or in-advance (i.e. pre-computation of a connectivity offer to be
   stored in a catalogue-like function of the NSBP).

   The standard PCE route request/response mechanisms based on PCEP is
   applied in the Service- PCE as per [RFC4655] and [RFC5440].

   Moreover, the Service-PCE better adapts to extend the concept and
   functionalities of a parent PCE ([I-D.ietf-pce-hierarchy-fwk]), as it
   can be used for a group of child technological/administrative domains
   within a carrier/Autonomous System, and the produced route offers can
   be in the form of sparse multi-domain EROs.

3.1.  Route cost vs. route price

   The route cost(s)/metric(s) are Traffic Engineering indicators used
   by the network administrator (carrier) to optimize the usage of its
   network resources.

   The route price is a different information with respect to the route
   cost, as it refers to the customer-supplier interaction at the
   business level for offering, negotiating and, eventually,
   instantiating a network connectivity service (e.g. a [G]MPLS LSP).
   The price of a network connectivity service generally depends on
   strategic factors, but it could also be influenced by the amount of
   mobilized network resources (along the route), the ingress/egress
   interfaces/PoPs, etc.

   Therefore, it could be provided by an extended PCE (i.e. the Service-
   PCE) as an optional route information, by using a mix of topology
   data, explicit route and policy data (both local and external to the
   service-PCE).


4.  PCEP protocol extensions

   The procedures and encoding adopted by a PCC and a service-PCE to
   handle the route offer computation with price information are
   described in this section.

   Two different set of extensions are defined for the PCEP for route
   offer computations: one for the PCEP Request (PCReq) message, and
   another for the PCEP Reply (PCRep) message.

4.1.  Price Request bit

   The format of a PCReq message for the request of a route offer
   computation is unchanged with respect to [RFC5440] and subsequent
   extensions.

                            <path-key-expansion> ::= <PATH-KEY>


   The route offer computation is identified by a new flag in the RP
   Object, the Price Request bit (P) (to be assigned by IANA,
   recommended bit 2).  The PCC requesting the PCE for a route offer
   computation will set the P bit in the corresponding RP object in the
   PCReq.

   Since all the other PCReq objects and parameters are left unchanged,
   the route offer computation constraints and parameters are similar to
   the ones defined for standard path computations.

        Figure 2: Modified RP object with P bit (Price Request bit)

4.1.1.  Processing rules

   A PCC sets the Price Request bit in the PCReq RP object to inform the
   PCE that the incoming PCReq message is requesting for a price
   computation.  On the other hand, when a PCE receives a PCReq message
   it checks the Price Request bit in the RP object to distinguish
   between a price computation and a standard path computation.

   When the Price Request bit is set, the PCE computes a set of route
   offers for the given endpoints by also calculating the respective
   route prices according to the constraints specified by the PCC in
   terms of end points, bandwidth, metrics, load balancing, etc. and the
   policies configured within the PCE.  In case the Price Request bit is
   set, but the PCE does not support the price computation function, it
   must return a PCErr message with Error-Type "Capability not
   supported" as per [RFC5440].

4.2.  PRICE-INFO Object

   The price computation performed by the PCE is delivered to the PCC in
   a new defined optional object, the PRICE-INFO object, carried in the
   path attribute-list section of the PCRep message.  The PRICE-INFO
   object, when present, encodes the set of route offers computed by the
   PCE for the end-to-end connectivity service requested by the PCC.
   More PRICE-INFO objects can be included in a PCRep message to provide
   more than one price for the same service.

   EDITOR NOTE: Usage of TLVs within PRICE-INFO could be considered, e.g
    to make the object more flexible and/or add multiple caps.  For the
   applicability to inter-carrier frameworks one cap is commonly enough,
       and usage of TLVs would just increase overhead on the object.

Internet-Draft               PCEP PRICE INFO                  March 2012


4.2.1.  Processing rules

   In case of successful route offers computation, the requested PCE
   replies to the requesting PCC with a PCRep message that must include
   at least one PRICE-INFO object.  Multiple PRICE-INFO objects can be
   included in the PCReq when more than one route offer is identified by
   the PCE for the requested end-to-end connectivity service.  In
   particular each PRICE-INFO object identifies a specific route offer:
   for instance, for the same carrier connectivity services two
   different route offers could be identified by the PCE, one for a with
   a Flat Price Model, and another with a Pay-as-you-go Price Model.
   All the PRICE-INFO objects carried in the PCReq message refer to the
   same ERO computed by the PCE: the ERO object, as a mandatory PCEP
   object, is always included in the PCReq message and along with the
   route offers identification build the extended PCReq path section in
   case of price computation (ref.  Figure 3).  On the other hand, in
   the case of unsuccessful price computation, the PCRep message must
   not carry any PRICE-object, while a NO-PATH object is included as
   specified in [RFC5440] for the standard path computation procedure.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  PRICE INFO Object

   IANA manages the PCEP Objects code point registry (see [RFC5440]).
   This is maintained as the "PCEP Objects" sub-registry of the "Path
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry.  This document
   defines a new PCEP object, the PRICE-INFO object, to be carried in
   PCRep messages.

   IANA should make the following allocation for PRICE-INFO object:

6.2.  RP Object Flag

   A new flag of the RP object (specified in [RFC5440]) is defined in
   this document.  IANA maintains a registry of RP object flags in the
   "RP Object Flag Field" sub-registry of the "Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry.

   IANA should make the following allocation:

            ------------------------------------------------
            2       Supply PRICE INFO on response     This Doc



7.  Security Considerations

   PCEP security mechanisms are described in [RFC5440] and are used to
   secure entire PCEP messages.  Nothing in this document changes the
   message flows or introduces any new messages; therefore, the security
   mechanisms set out in [RFC5440] continue to be applicable.  This
   document introduces a single new object that may optionally be
   carried on PCEP messages and will be automatically secured using the
   mechanisms described in [RFC5440].  If a PCEP message is vulnerable
   to attack (for example, because the security mechanisms are not
   used), then the price request bit in RP and the PRICE-INFO object
   could be used as part of an attack; however, it is likely that other
   objects will provide far more significant ways of attacking a PCE or
   PCC in this case.
