             Network Architecture with Recursive Addressing
                          draft-dykim-nara-00

Abstract

   A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed.
   The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being
   a collection of nodes.  Each site is named by a site address drawn
   from a global number space while each node is named by a node address
   drawn from a number space local to each site.  Routing among sites
   depends solely on site addresses while that within each site on node
   addresses.  Flat routing to render inherent mobility as well as
   mapped routing to additionally cope with table size are proposed.
   The model can recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in
   the network, enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-
   planetary as well as body area networks.

1.  Introduction

   Scalability of the Internet has long been recognized as one of its
   major problems.  Explosion of DFZ(Default Free Zone) routing tables,
   one aspect of the problem, has resulted from the Internet's inability
   of efficient multi-homing, for which semantic overloading of IP
   address has been blamed.  This semantic overloading, that IP
   addresses are used as both identifiers(IDs) and Locators(Locs) for
   nodes, has also been perceived as against the naming and addressing
   principles[IEN0001][IEN0019][RFC1498] and so as the main obstacle
   hindering the Internet from providing fast mobility and multihoming.

   A considerable number of new protocols based on the Loc/ID
   Separation(LIS) architecture have been proposed thus far.  Some of
   them are host-based solutions [RFC4423][GSE][ILNP][IEEE-MCOM]while
   others are router-based[LISP][IRON][Ivip].  Most such proposals share
   one thing; IDs and Locs are global.

   This document proposes an architecture, named NARA, based on local
   addressing in its strict sense.  Local addresses, for nodes, are
   never exploited in DFZ (called exterior in this document) routing.  A
   collection of nodes under an autonomous administration is called a
   site, and only site addresses identifying them are used for exterior
   routing.  That way, the global network is split into two rather
   orthogonal tiers.

   NARA is very close to the ideas proposed in ENCAPS and
   hIPv4[RFC1955][RFC6306].  The latter two, however, name node
   interfaces (or point of attachment: PoA) with either global IP
   addresses (in ENCAPS) or local Endpoint Locators (in hIPv4), whereas
   node themselves are named by local addresses in NARA.

   Node addresses in NARA are semantically overloaded.  They are used
   for end-to-end connections as well as for routing.  This is a stark
   contrast to prevalent arguments of LIS.  Semantic overloading is not
   seen as an evil in NARA, but is rather positively exploited to
   provide fast mobility and seamless multihoming.

   Although this document describes NARA in two tier networks, the same
   addressing and routing principle can be recursively repeated inwards
   and outwards off a given network tier.  In this respect, NARA can be
   considered as one of recursive network architectures.

   Following sections describe the architecture of NARA and associated
   routing, along with implementation choices for a better chance of
   deployability.  Consequences of the proposal are provided before
   concluding the document.

2.  Architecture

   The Internet is modeled as a networked collection of autonomous
   sites.  A site is a collection of nodes, also called either
   hosts(leaf node) or routers(relay nodes).  A subset of hosts and an
   associated router forms a subnet.  Therefore, a site can also be
   considered as a networked collection of subnets.  A site itself can
   be a leaf or a transit.

                  Figure 1: Operational overview of NARA

   The Internet is therefore governed by two-tier administration, i.e.,
   the global authority and site authorities.

   A site is named by a global site address while a node by a node
   address local to a given site.  Now that each subnet is associated
   with a router, it can be identified by a router address.

   Exterior routing among sites is done solely on site addresses while
   interior routing on node addresses.  Node addresses are not used in
   exterior routing.  That is, exterior and interior routings are
   orthogonal to each other.

   Transport connections are also associated with node addresses.  In
   this sense, it can be said that node addresses are semantically
   overloaded.  In this proposed network architecture, semantic
   overloading of addresses is not considered harmful; it is considered
   rather natural and even desirable.

   Neither node- nor site-addresses bear topological significance; they
   each consume separate flat number spaces.  Node addresses don't
   change while nodes are moving around within a site.  Site addresses
   also don't change at migration between upstream network providers as
   well as at multi-homing.

   Node names are global.  A name server provides mapping between a node
   name and a {node address, site address} tuple.  If the site address
   is local, packets are delivered to the target interior node by use of
   an interior routing.  If it is foreign, packets are delivered to one
   of exterior routers, aka gateways, interfacing with other sites.

3.  INTERIOR ROUTING

   Packets in the site tier, interior to sites, are routed solely on
   node addresses.  Site addresses don't come into play in interior
   routing.  Any protocols including OSPF and ISIS can be applied to
   this interior routing.

3.1.  Flat-Address Routing

   In a scenario of flat-address routing, node addresses are directly
   used in routing and forwarding decisions.  Each router maintains a
   table of {target node address, target router address, next-hop router
   address} tuples.  Tables are updated through routing information
   exchange between routers.

   Hosts may not involve themselves directly with such routing tables.
   It is up to routers to route packets exiting nodes.

   When a node moves from one subnet to another, such a membership
   change is broadcast to all other routers in the site by the previous
   and/or newly visited subnet router(s).  Host mobility provided
   directly by routers in this way can hence be fast.

   When a subnet moves along with the associated router, such a move
   will be perceived as a topological change of the network and will be
   reflected in the routing tables at the speed of associated link-state

   updates.  Henceforth, (subnet) network mobility is provided also as
   an inherent feature of the routing.

3.2.  Mapped-Address Routing

   In a scenario of mapped-address routing, a common mapping server
   inside a given site is used in order to shrink the table size of each
   routers. {target node address, target router address} tuples are
   maintained by the mapping server whereas router tables will keep only
   {target node address, next-hop router address} tuples as with usual
   router activities.  At reception of the first packet from a node
   after a given inactive interval, the router will consult the mapping
   server for the associated target router address.  The associated
   next-hop router will then be determined by a given routing algorithm.
   Acquired {target node address, target router address} tuples may be
   cached at routers but will be short-lived lest stale information be
   used for mobile hosts.

   Hosts themselves need not be aware of existence of the mapping
   server.  They will continue to involve themselves only with node
   addresses, for source and target, and rely on routers for path
   finding.  They will behave themselves the same way as they do with
   flat routing.

   This scenario of mapped-address routing is very similar to the
   related operation of cellular networks.  This might rather be
   considered as a merit, for cellular networks are known for their fast
   mobility.

4.  EXTERIOR ROUTING

   Packets in the global tier, exterior to sites, are routed solely on
   site addresses.  Node addresses are not advertised into the global
   tier.  Any protocols, BGP, OSPF or ISIS, can be applied to this
   exterior routing.

   Each transit-sites can be considered to correspond, in a generic
   network graph, to relay nodes(routers) whereas leaf sites to leaf
   nodes(hosts).  Therefore, symmetry of network architecture repeats
   itself at each tier.

4.1.  Flat-Address Routing

   In a scenario of flat-address routing, site addresses are directly
   used in routing and forwarding decisions.  Each transit gateway
   maintains a table of {target site address, target transit-site
   address, next-hop transit-site address} tuples.  Tables are updated
   through routing information exchange between transit gateways.  For
   multi-homed target sites, multiple entries for the same target site

   may exist with different next-hop transit-site addresses.

   Leaf gateways may not involve themselves directly with such routing
   tables.  It is up to transit gateways to route packets exiting leaf
   sites.

4.2.  Virtual-Address Routing

   In a scenario of virtual-address routing, aggregatable addresses are
   used in order to shrink the routing table size.  Transit gateways may
   use PA(provider-aggregatable) prefixes as virtual addresses for
   routing instead of site addresses.  Each site address will then be
   associated with one or more (for multi-homing) PA prefixes, with such
   mapping maintained by a mapping server in the global tier.  A site
   address will be converted by an upstream transit gateway to a PA
   prefix at entering that upstream provider, and the PA prefix will
   subsequently be converted back to the site address at leaving the
   upstream provider into the downstream target site.

   Leaf gateways themselves need not be aware of existence of such PA
   prefixes.  They will continue to involve themselves only with site
   addresses, for source and target, and hence behave themselves the
   same way as they do with flat routing.

5.  IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES

   Although the proposed network architecture of NARA is described in a
   generic way, it can be tailored for smooth and incremental deployment
   in the existing Internet.

5.1.  Node Address

   In principle, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be used for local node
   addresses.  However, since 32-bit might be more than enough for most
   sites, use of IPv4 addresses might be more appealing.

   Use of IPv4 addresses ensures minimal changes to existing vast
   population of IPv4 hosts.  Also, transition to IPv6 addresses will
   not be a requisite anymore, but a luxurious option at most.

   It is to be noted that IP addresses adopted as such do not name
   interfaces anymore but name nodes themselves.  That is, although IP
   addresses will continue to be used, interpretation of their context
   will be changed.

5.2.  Site Address

   32-bit IP addresses can be used for site addresses.  The uniqueness
   of the site addresses will be maintained by the distribution
   authorities like ICANN.

   One might wonder where to carry site addresses.  It is proposed to
   carry them in the IPv4 option field of length 32 bits.  It is long
   enough to accommodate a considerable number of sites that may
   additionally come into being in the global Internet.

   Another option is to follow the scheme proposed in hIPv4.  That is,
   node addresses and site addresses can be swapped by gateways (called
   Locator Swap Router in hIPv4) at exiting and entering given sites.

5.3.  Name Servers

   In the two-tier model described here, names are globally unique.  DNS
   can continue to be used with a bit of extension; to return {node
   address, site address} pairs instead of {IP address}.

   The scope of names can be an issue in recursive repetition of this
   network architecture.  If the tiers would recurse without bound
   inwards and/or outwards, demanding uniqueness of names in the entire
   resultant network may not be feasible because of excessive length of
   the names.

Internet-Draft                    NARA                          May 2012


   Name resolution can also be done recursively.  For example, if a
   remote node wants to get a body temperature of a human node, an
   application message "get body temperature" may first be targeted to
   the human node of an address pair (node, site), for which a name
   server as in Fig. 1 has done the mapping.  Then, the content of the
   message may be used to consult another name server encompassing the
   tier pair one level deeper, that is the tier where the human body
   belongs and another covering the nodes inside the human body.  This
   name server can then return an address pair (in-human node, human
   node) to continue address swapping to reach the final thermometer.
   That is to say, context-awareness may ensure recursive name service.

5.4.  Routing Protocols

   OSPF or ISIS can be used for interior routing.  A difference is that
   IP addresses (as node addresses) now points to nodes instead of
   interfaces.  Changes to OSPF coding should be minimal.  ISIS might be
   better suited in this sense because it inherently deals with node
   addresses.

   Although other protocols, in principle, could also be used for
   exterior routing, BGP4 with some modification with virtual-address
   routing might be a choice more acceptable as a start to most existing
   ISPs and large transit sites.

6.  DEPLOYABILITY

6.1.  Distribution of Site Addresses

   The first step towards to introduction of NARA is that site addresses
   be distributed and managed by naming and numbering authorities like
   ICANN and regional Internet registries.

6.2.  Changes to DNS

   DNS shall be recoded or reconfigured to deal with {node address, site
   address} pairs in place of only {IP address}.  Necessary changes
   would be trivial and so could be done in a global scale with minimal
   pains.

6.3.  Changes to Hosts

   As far as transport connections are concerned, nothing changes for
   hosts.

   The only change would be reconfigure and enable hosts to put the site
   address acquired from DNS into the IP option field.  There'll be rare
   need to look into the site address in received packets since it is
   not associated with transport connections at all; the node address
   only will be.

6.4.  Changes to Routers

   If flat-address routing is used, a new column has to be added to the
   routing table to house target node addresses.  Also, membership
   change of children nodes per each router should be added to link-
   state update messages.

   A potential concern about the flat-address routing is that the number
   of table entries will considerably increase to accommodate all
   possible active nodes in a given site.  This may be seen as too much
   a burden for large sites, although it may be quite manageable for
   small sites.  The resultant table size could be economically
   affordable even for larger sites, considering the current memory
   technology.  Another issue might be the lookup speed for such large
   tables, for which there might be an ample number of smart
   implementation techniques.

   Benefits from this large flat tables is, however, huge.  Mobility,
   for both hosts and subnets, is provided as an inherent function of
   routing.  No extra infrastructural element is needed, and the
   provided mobility is very fast, i.e., at the speed of broadcast
   packet propagation.

Internet-Draft                    NARA                          May 2012


   If mapped-address routing should be used, the table to be managed by
   each router will be the same as with usual routing; {target node
   address, next-hop router address}.  Only extra action to be taken is
   consult an in-site server for {target node address, target router
   address} mapping, to be cached for persistent continuation of smooth
   packet flow for an ongoing session.  Necessary code changes will be
   minimal.

6.5.  Use of IP Option Field

   Hosts and routers will have to be ready to use IP option fields.  It
   is asserted by a lot of experts that use of the IP option field is
   not going to work since most routers today, interior as well as
   exterior, are configured by network operators simply to ignore any IP
   options.

   However, as long as the problem is non-use of an available facility
   rather than lack of its implementation, it would highly be encouraged
   to reconfigure the nodes to respond to option fields to switch to the
   operational mode proposed by NARA.

   Another side effect of the use of the IP option field is increasing
   the packet size by 64-bits; 32 bits for each source and target site
   addresses.  This should, however, be a minimal burden in view of the
   benefits from the new architecture as well as compared to other new
   network architectural proposals most of which inevitably increase the
   packet size.

6.6.  Introduction of Extra Servers

   If mapped-address interior routing is to be used, a mapping server
   has to be installed inside each site.  If virtual-address exterior
   routing is to be used, another mapping server has to be installed in
   the exterior (global) tier.  Installation and management of such
   servers involve only central management authorities, not every client
   nodes or sites, and hence any cost or pains should be confined to a
   small number of entities.

7.  CONSEQUENCES

7.1.  Recursive Internet

   In NARA, the network architectures of the interior (in-site) and the
   exterior (global) tiers are symmetric, basically the same.
   Therefore, the same generic architecture can be repeated without
   bound outwards as well as inwards.  For example, in the design of an
   inter-planetary Internet, the same architecture can be placed on top
   of the global Internet.  Also, in accommodating edge networks like
   body area networks which by themselves may each consist of a huge
   number of internal nodes(e.g. in the case of intelligent robots),
   repetition of the same architecture might significantly reduce the
   complexity of the whole-scale networking.

   The Internet modeled as with NARA can be asserted to be scalable and
   expandable without bound.

7.2.  No Address Depletion

   Since the global Internet is split into two tiers of manageable size,
   there'd be no danger of address depletion.  The 32-bit length for
   node addresses will be more than enough for most sites' need.  The
   same should be true of the 32-bit site address length.  In fact,
   migration to IPv6 is not a requirement anymore, but merely a
   luxurious option.

7.3.  No Inadvertent Internet Governance

   Since sites don't have to buy node address spaces from any
   authorities, the impact of the Internet governance will reduce only
   to a minimal necessity.

7.4.  Fast Mobility

   Host mobility inside a site is provided as default.  Transport
   connections are associated with node addresses which don't change
   while nodes are moving inside a given site.  Transport connections
   don't break at in-site host mobility.  And since such mobility is
   directly provided by link-state routing, with periodic link-state
   updates augmented by immediate event broadcast, host mobility is as
   fast as the speed of broadcast packet propagation.

   Network(subnet) mobility is also provided as an inherent feature of
   interior routing.  Renumbering of mobile subnets is not necessary
   since each subnet is identified by the associated router address
   which, being itself a node address, does not change inside a given
   site.

Internet-Draft                    NARA                          May 2012


   Mobility across sites poses a number of challenges.  In order to
   continue communication in a newly visited site, node authentication
   will have to take place before anything.  Such authentication process
   may take a considerable number of seconds, if not minutes, hard to
   guarantee non-breakage of transport connections.

   Even if authentication may be swift enough to guarantee sustaining
   mobile connections, reflection of site changes onto the name server
   might take at least tens of seconds to converge.  If this time lag is
   not to be borne, the gateway of the previous site might continue
   redirecting the incoming packets to the newly visited site, just long
   enough for name servers to converge.  Engineering techniques employed
   by cellular networks might enlighten the detailed design of fast
   cross-site mobility in NARA.

7.5.  Site Multi-homing and Migration

   Site addresses also don't change at migration to new upstream transit
   sites.  Therefore, there's no need for refreshing DNS for nodes
   inside migrating sites.  The only action might be to update the
   entries for migrating sites in the {site address, PA prefix} mapping
   server, yet only in the case of virtual-address routing.

   Site multi-homing with flat exterior routing is not a problem,
   either.  The same site address of a multi-homed site will simply be
   seen simultaneously in gateway routing tables of involved upstream
   transit sites.  In the case of virtual-address routing, multiple
   entries will exist in the mapping server for the same multi-homed
   site, a {site address, PA prefix} pair for each upstream transit
   sites.

7.6.  Host Multi-homing

   Host multi-homing can also be supported.  If a host is multi-homed on
   multiple sites, there'd be multiple return values {node address, site
   address} for the same name.  Transport connections through different
   sites would be considered as different ones.  If there's need to
   converge these multiple connections to be presented as a single
   virtual transport connection to a given application, some sort of
   session management function might be exploited on top of the
   transport layer as is done with MPTCP[RFC6182].

7.7.  Traffic Engineering

   Gateways of a multi-homed sites can control inbound traffic according
   to the remote site addresses.  Interior routers can also choose exit
   gateways in accordance with target site addresses.

Internet-Draft                    NARA                          May 2012


   If traffic engineering in the granularity of a node is desired, nodes
   may involve themselves in informing the subnet routers of their
   preferred site address of a given remote multi-homed site or even the
   preferred site address of a given remote multi-homed node.  The same
   can be done for preference about the exiting gateway.

   MPTCP can additionally be employed with no impact on the normal NARA
   operation, to benefit from its implicit traffic engineering
   capability, too.

7.8.  No Renumbering

   Since node addresses are local, no renumbering of nodes is necessary
   at site migration or multi-homing.

7.9.  Semantic Overloading

   The current proposal implicitly suggests that semantic overloading of
   an address may not be seen as a fatal problem to a network
   architecture.  The addresses, of nodes and sites, are used both for
   identification and routing in NARA.  This contextual malleability of
   addresses is seen as rather a virtue than an evil.  It can also be
   argued that whatever separation one might engineer, semantic
   overloading would inevitably result in one way or another and so
   should rather be received as a natural phenomenon of networking.

8.  CONCLUSIONS

   A network architecture based on local and recursive addressing is
   introduced.  The Internet is seen as a collection of sites, each
   being itself a collection of nodes.  Addresses local to a given sites
   name nodes whereas global addresses do sites.  Mobility, of both
   hosts and subnets, is very fast because it is provided directly by
   routers as one of their inherent features.  Frozen site- as well as
   node- addresses guarantee seamless site migration and multi-homing
   with no need of renumbering.  Address depletion is not an issue
   anymore and the Internet governance reduces to a minimal necessity.
   The proposed network model can repeat itself outwards as well as
   inwards, enabling its applicability to inter-plenary Internet as well
   as to body area networks.
