        7. Acknowledgments......................................                                                                 10 
         
     1. Introduction 
         
        Within Energy Management there are terms that may seem 
        obvious to a casual reader but in fact require a rigorous 
        and sourced definition.  To avoid any confusion in terms 
        among the working group drafts, one glossary / lexicon of 
        terms should exist that all drafts can refer to. This will 
        avoid a review of terms multiplied across drafts.   
         
        This draft will contain a glossary of definitions of terms 
        that can be agreed upon by the working group outside of the 
        context of drafts and then included in or sourced to this 
        draft.  
         
        Each term will contain a definition(s), a normative or 
        informative reference, an optional example, an optional 
        comment(s) listed a note(s).   
         
        All terms should be rooted with a well-known reference. If 
        a definition is taken verbatim from a reference then the 
        source is listed in square brackets. If a definition is 
        derived from a well-known reference then the source is 
        listed as "Adapted from" with the reference listed in 
        square brackets. If a defined term is newly defined here 
        the reference will indicate as such by stating "herein" and 
        if applicable list any composing terms from this document.   
      
        The terms are listing in an order that aids in reading 
        where terms may build off a previous term as opposed to an 
        alphabetical ordering. Some terms that are common in 
        electrical engineering or that describe common physical 
        items use a lower case notation. 
         
     2. Terminology 
         
        $ Energy Management 
          Energy Management is a set of functions for measuring, 
          modeling, planning, and optimizing networks to ensure

          that the network and network attached devices use energy 
          efficiently and appropriately for the nature of the 
          application and the cost constraints of the organization.  
           
          Reference: Adapted from [ITU-T-M-3400] 
           
          NOTES:  
          1. Energy management refers to the activities, methods, 
          procedures and tools that pertain to measuring, modeling, 
          planning, controlling and optimizing the use of energy in 
          networked systems [NMF]. 
           
          2. Energy Management is a management domain which is 
          congruent to any of the FCAPS areas of management in the 
          ISO/OSI Network Management Model [TMN]. Energy Management 
          for communication networks and attached devices is a 
          subset or part of an organization's greater Energy 
          Management Policies. 
         
        $ Energy Management System (EnMS) 
          An Energy Management System is a combination of hardware 
          and software used to administer a network with the 
          primary purpose of energy management. 
           
          Reference: Adapted from [1037C] 
           
          NOTES: 
          1. An Energy Management System according to [ISO50001] 
          (ISO-EnMS) is a set of systems or procedures upon which 
          organizations can develop and implement an energy policy, 
          set targets, action plans and take into account legal 
          requirements related to energy use.  An ISO-EnMS allows 
          organizations to improve energy performance and 
          demonstrate conformity to requirements, standards, and/or 
          legal requirements.   
           
          2. Example ISO-EnMS:  Company A defines a set of policies 
          and procedures indicating there should exist multiple 
          computerized systems that will poll energy from their 
          meters and pricing / source data from their local 
          utility. Company A specifies that their CFO should 
          collect information and summarize it quarterly to be sent 
          to an accounting firm to produce carbon accounting 
          reporting as required by their local government.  
           
          3. For the purposes of EMAN, the definition from [1037C] 
          is the preferred meaning of an Energy Management System 
          (EnMS). The definition from [ISO50001] can be referred to 
          as ISO Energy Management System (ISO-EnMS).
