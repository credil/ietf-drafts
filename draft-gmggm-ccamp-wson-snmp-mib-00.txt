       A SNMP MIB to manage GMPLS TED with WSON specific support
                   draft-gmggm-ccamp-wson-snmp-mib-00

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for GMPLS based
   networks.

   In particular in the context Wavelength Switching Optical Network
   (WSON) two sets of information were defined: a general constrains set
   (reusable by other technologies) and a WSON specific set.  This
   document defines a MIB module for supporting GMPLS WSON specific
   information.

Internet-Draft               GMPLS WSON MIB                    July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in GMPLS networks.

   Extentions to current GMPLS to support Wavelength Switched Optical
   Networks (WSON) [RFC6163] include new objects with specific protocol
   extentions.  Some information where selected as a generic constrains
   since they could be easily apply to other technologies than WSON.  As
   such this [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-general-constraints-ospf-te] OSPF-TE
   was proposed and those information will be managed through a
   separated MIB [ref required].

   In case of WSON some technology specific information are required and
   defined through [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-info] and
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signal-compatibility-ospf].  This MIB module
   will defines objects related to WSON specific informaton.

   [EDITOR NOTE] Very early draft to start MIB activity on GMPSL-WSON
   related extentions and collect feedback from working group.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] In
   the description of OIDs the convention: Set (S) Get (G) and Trap (T)
   conventions will describe the action allowed by the paramenter.

Internet-Draft               GMPLS WSON MIB                    July 2012


4.  Overview

   This MIB module should be used in conjunction with
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ted-mib] since it only defineds additional
   parmaters to GMPLS TED MIB.


5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  tedWsonNodeTable

5.1.1.  tedWsonResourceBlockInformation

5.1.2.  tedWsonResourcePoolAccessibility

5.1.3.  tedWsonResourceBlockWavelengthConstraints

5.1.4.  tedWsonResourcePoolState

5.1.5.  tedWsonBlockSharedAccessWavelengthAvailability


6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the [TEMPLATE TODO] MIB

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS


7.  Definitions


   [TEMPLATE TODO]: put your valid MIB module here.
   A list of tools that can help automate the process of
   checking MIB definitions can be found at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-review-tools.html


8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

Internet-Draft               GMPLS WSON MIB                    July 2012


   o

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


9.  IANA Considerations

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"

Internet-Draft               GMPLS WSON MIB                    July 2012


   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
   draft MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in an internet draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
