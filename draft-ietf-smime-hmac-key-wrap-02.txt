        RFC 3537

        Title:      Wrapping a Hashed Message Authentication Code
                    (HMAC) key with a Triple-Data Encryption Standard
                    (DES) Key or an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
                    Key

This document defines two methods for wrapping an HMAC (Hashed Message
Authentication Code) key.  The first method defined uses a Triple DES
(Data Encryption Standard) key to encrypt the HMAC key.  The second
method defined uses an AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) key to
encrypt the HMAC key.  One place that such an algorithm is used is for
the Authenticated Data type in CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax).

This document is a product of the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group of
the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
