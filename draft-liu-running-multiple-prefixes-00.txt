Internet-Draft         Running Multiple Prefixes             June 2013




1. Introduction

   IP protocols have been widely spread. More and more services are
   relying on IP technology. As the evolution of network application,
   the IP network architecture/functions are becoming more and more
   sophisticated.

   One aspect is the requirement of multiple prefixes. There are several
   motivations of multiple prefixes, as the following:

   - Multiple network provisioning, including multihoming and semantic
   prefixes (as described in section 2.4) etc;

   - Multiple logic planes, VPN/OAM .etc.

   In IPv6, multiple prefixes feature is naturally well-supported.
   Standard IPv6 stack supports multiple-address-per-interface as
   default; there is a standard address selection algorithms (RFC6724)
   defined for multiple prefixes purpose. It is one of the most
   important difference and also a advantage from IPv4 to IPv6.

   This document introduces several multiple prefixes use cases in IPv6
   that might be beneficial to the network use. And some operational
   considerations are given, as while as some current gaps for
   supporting running multiple prefixes.

2. Multiple Prefixes Use cases

2.1. Multihoming

   When a network is multihomed, the multiple upstream networks would
   assign prefixes respectively. If a network for some reason neither
   acquire a PI (Provider Independent) space nor deploies IPv6 NAT, then
   the multihoming would resulting in hosts with multiple PA (Provider
   Aggregated) IPv6 addresses with different prefixes.

   This approach in IPv4 has rarely been used, since the IPv4 doesn't
   support multiple addresses/prefixes well. But it is quite practical
   in IPv6. This approach allows the SMEs to do multihoming without
   burden from running PI address space or running IPv6 NAT. Furthermore,
   multiple PA spaces don't have the poteincial global routing system
   scalable issue as the PI does [RFC4894].

   However, multihoming with multiple PA spaces has some operational
   issues which mainly include address selection, next-hop selection,

   and exit-router selection. Especially for the exit-router selection,
   it seems there has not been any practical solution yet.

2.2. ULA+PA

   Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) are defined in [RFC4193] as provider-
   independent prefixes. Since there is a 40 bits pseudo random field in
   the ULA prefix, there is no practical risk of collision (please refer
   to section 3.2.3 in [RFC4193] for more detail).

   For either home networks or enterprise networks, the main purpose of
   using ULA along with GUA is to provide a logically local routing
   plane separated from the globally routing plane. The benefit is to
   ensure stable and specific local communication regardless of the ISP
   uplink failure or change. This benefit is especially meaningful for
   the home network or private OAM function in an enterprise.

   In some special cases such as renumbering, enterprise administrators
   may want to avoid the need to renumber their internal-only, private
   nodes when they have to renumber the PA addresses of the whole
   network because of changing ISPs, ISPs restructure their address
   allocations, or whatever reasons. In these situations, ULA is an
   effective tool for the internal-only nodes.

2.3. Make-before-break renumbering

   [RFC4192] describes a procedure that can be used to renumber a
   network from one prefix to another smoothly through a "make-before-
   break" transition.

   In the transition period, both the old and new prefixes are available,
   it is a very good use of multiple prefixes that could avoid the
   session outage issue in most of the situations when renumbering a
   network.

2.4. Semantic Prefixes

   [I-D.jiang-semantic-prefix] describes a framework to embed some
   parameters into the IPv6 prefix segment. The parameters might contain
   user types, service types, applications, security requirements,
   traffic identity types, quality requirements and other criteria may
   also be relevant parameters which a network operator may wish to use
   to treat packets differently and efficiently.

   With this approach, for example, the ISPs could provision one
   subscriber multiple addresses/prefixes to access different services.

3. Basic operational considerations

   There might be some argument/worry that in practice running multiple
   prefixes would makes terrible operational complexity. It is
   apprehensible that most of the administrators are not be accustomed
   to this model, since it is quite different with that in IPv4.

   But considering running multiple prefixes in IPv6 might be very
   common, administrators need to adapt this new operational model
   regardless of personal prefer.

   Following sub-sections summarize several important operational
   considerations that try to eliminate the FUD of the administrators.

3.1. Multiple prefix provisioning

   - Multiple provisioning domains: considering current DHCP
   architecture does not fit multiple provisioning domain well, the
   administrators should avoid that multiple provisioning domain all
   directly configuring the host through DHCP, since it might cause
   confusion for the host.

   - Multiple provisioning mechanisms: if administrators applied
   DHCP/SLAAC co-exist in one network, then they need to learn that
   there might be some issues, which are reported in [I-D.liu-bonica-
   dhcpv6-slaac-problems].

3.2. Multiple addresses in one interface

   - Current implementations support this feature very well, normally
   this wouldn't be a problem

   - But current IPAM/NMS applications might have not ready for this
   multiple mappings management

3.3. Address selection

   This is probably the most error prone problematic issue in running
   multiple prefixes.

   [RFC5220] reported various potential problems with address selection
   in deployment. Some of them have been handled in the updated standard
   address selection mechanism [RFC6724].

   (Editor's Note: to be filled with more detail in this topic.)

3.4. DNS relevant

   Normally, one SP only allows only its users to look at DNS records of
   the service. So in multiple network provisioning scenarios, each DNS
   query from a host must be forwarded to a suitable DNS server. Hosts
   normally are not able to select a DNS server for each DNS query
   target.

   [RFC6731] is developed for this purpose, it defined DHCPv4/v6 options
   to deliver the DNS selection policies for hosts.

4. Current Gaps

   o Not all IPAM/NMS tools are be able to handle one interface and
      multiple addresses mappings.

   o ULA+IPv4 selection

   There is a special case that needs to be noticed, which is described
   in section 2.2.2 of [RFC5220]. When an enterprise has IPv4 Internet
   connectivity but does not yet have IPv6 Internet connectivity, and
   the enterprise wants to provide site-local IPv6 connectivity, a ULA
   is the best choice for site-local IPv6 connectivity. Each employee
   host will have both an IPv4 global or private address and a ULA. Here,
   when this host tries to connect to an outside node that has
   registered both A and AAAA records in the DNS, the host will choose
   AAAA as the destination address and the ULA for the source address
   according to the IPv6 preference of the default address selection
   policy. This will clearly result in a connection failure.

   Although with Happy Eyeballs [RFC6555] this connection failure
   problem could be solved, but unwanted timeouts would obviously lower
   the user experience. One possible approach of eliminating the
   timeouts is configuring IPv4 preference on the hosts, and not
   including DNS A records but only AAAA records for the internal nodes
   in the internal DNS server, then outside nodes have both A and AAAA
   records could be connected through IPv4 as default and internal nodes
   could be always connected through IPv6. But since IPv6 preference is
   default, changing the default in all nodes is not easy.Security
   Considerations

   o Multiple PA exit-router selection

   In multiple PA multihoming networks, if the ISPs enable ingress
   filtering at the edge, then the administrators need to deal with the
   the exit router selection issues. Currently there is no well-used

   solution, so the administrator might need to communicate with the ISP
   for not filtering the prefixes.

5. Security Considerations

   TBD.

6. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not request any IANA actions.
