Internet-Draft          NVO3 Use Case                         June 2012


1. Introduction

   This document provides the use cases for Network Virtualization
   Overlay, i.e. NVO3, which is driven by Data Center Networks. These
   use cases are intended to help validate the framework and
   requirements as along with the development of the solutions.

   The advent of the hypervisor eliminated the tight coupling of an
   endpoint from the physical computer on which it ran.  This change
   has allowed the physical computer to become a service point rather
   than a client.  The goal of NVO3 is to no longer treat the physical
   computer as a client of the network but as a native service point of
   the network.

   Although overlay networks have been around for many years,
   hypervisor-aware overlay networks have certain characteristics that
   are suited for the Data Center (DC) environment.  The main
   differences between other overlay network technologies and NVO3 is
   that the client edges, of the NVO3 network, are individual
   virtualized hosts and not network sites, and the hosts and the
   network edge may be on the same physical device. Other
   differentiating characteristics may include (1) virtual host access
   and mobility which causes association between hosts to NVo3 edge
   nodes to be non-fixed (2) Less chance for loop among VMs attached to
   NVo3 edge due to simple topology.

   NVO3 use cases can be highly varied.  This document outlines some
   basic scenarios and groups them into three sets.

   One set of use cases is to connect many tenant end systems in one
   Data Center and form an L2 or L3 communication domain. Overlay
   tenant virtual networks segregate tenant traffic and allow
   individual tenants having its own address space and isolating the
   space from DC infrastructure. In addition, they allow VM moves from
   one server to another.

   The second set of NVO3 use cases is for a DC provider to offer a
   secure DC service to an enterprise customer. In these cases, the
   enterprise customer may use a VPN provided by a carrier or IPsec
   over Internet connecting to an overlay virtual network offered by a
   Data Center provider.

   The third set of NVO3 use cases is to enable the designs of various
   DC applications using the service applications, compute, storage,
   and networking. In this case, NVO3 provides the networking functions
   for the applications.

Internet-Draft          NVO3 Use Case                         June 2012

   The document uses the reference model and terminologies defined in
   [NVo3FRWK] to describe the use cases.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminologies defined in [NVO3FRWK],
   [RFC4364]. Some additional terms used in the document are listed
   here.

   VNIF: VNI Interconnection Interface on an NVE

   L2 VNI: L2 Virtual Network Instance

   L3 VNI: L3 Virtual Network Instance

   ARP: Address Resolution Protocol

   DNS: Domain Name Service

   DMZ: DeMilitarized Zone

   NAT: Network Address Translation

3. Virtual Network in One Data Center

   A tenant virtual network may exist in one DC. The virtual network
   interconnects many tenant end systems that run as a closed use group.

   Figure 1 depicts this case. NVE1 and NVE2 are two network virtual
   edges that may exist on a server or ToR. Each NVE may be configured
   with multiple virtual network instances that have different
   topologies. In this illustration, three virtual network instances
   with VN context Ta, Tn, and Tm are shown. VNIa terminates on both
   NVE1 and NVE2; VNIn terminates on NVE1 and VNIm at NVE2 only. Each
   NVE has one overlay module to perform frame
   encapsulation/decapsulation and tunneling initiation/termination. In
   this scenario, a tunnel between NVE1 and NVE2 is necessary for the
   virtual network Ta.

  A VNI terminated on an NVE may locally associate to one or more VAPs
  each of which may associate with one or more TESs. It is possible
  that the VNI does not attach to any VAP (see section 5).  One VAP
  associates to one VNI terminated on an NVE. One tenant virtual
  network instance may terminate on many NVEs and interconnect several
  thousands of TESs, the ability of supporting a large number of TESs
  per tenant instance and TES mobility is critical for NVO3 solution.

   Individual virtual network instances may use its own address space
   and the space is isolated from DC infrastructure. This eliminates
   the route changes in the DC underlying network when VMs move. Note:
   the NVO3 solutions still have to address VM move in overlay network.

   When a DC operator creates a VM on a server, he/she has a plan which
   VN the VM belongs to and assigns the VM to the VN via an
   administration system such as vCenter. When a VM is alive/off, i.e.
   power-on/off, or relocated to another server, its associated NVE
   should be notified. NVO3 solution is necessary to support these
   features.[TESNVE][SV2NVE]

   If a tenant virtual network spans across multiple DC sites, one
   design is to allow the corresponding NVO3 instance seamlessly span
   across those sites without DC gateway routers' termination. In this
   case, the tunnel may in turn be tunneled over other intermediate
   tunnels over the Internet or other WANs, or the intra DC and inter
   DC tunnels are stitched together to form an end-to-end tunnel
   between two NVEs.

4. Interconnection between DC Virtual Network and External Users

   In this scenario, the customers (an enterprise or individuals)
   utilize the DC provider's compute and storage resources to run its
   applications, and the DC provider allows the customer to access his
   hosted end systems through a Carrier WAN or Internet. Three cases
   are described here.

4.1. One Virtual Network Method for DC Connectivity

   If both the DC Provider and Carrier use the same encapsulation and
   tunneling technology, it is possible to configure one overlay
   virtual network instance across DC networks and Carrier networks.
   For example, if both DC provider and Carrier use existing MPLS-based
   VPN solutions [RFC4364] and GRE Tunnel, the NVE in DC and the PE in
   WAN can be members of one VN instance. Figure 2 illustrates this
   scenario. The left side of the figure presents an NVE (NVE1) in DC
   Provider site connecting to tenant end-systems; the right side shows
   Provider Edge (PE1) in a WAN network connecting to Customer Edge (CE)
   at an Enterprise site. The CE is often a network site and contains
   routers and/or switches and terminal systems.

   In this case, an L3 VNI and L3VPN instance are configured on NVE1
   and PE1, respectively. If the MPLS label is used as VN context/VPN
   identifier and GRE tunnel (IPsec)[RFC4023] is established between
   NVE1 and PE1, the configuration will provide the L3 connectivity
   between a TES and CE.  The MPLS label for the L3 VNI identifier (Ta)
   on NVE1 can be different from the MPLS label for the L3VPN
   identifier (VPNID) on PE1 since MPLS labels are locally significant.
   Although the figure shows Overlay Module on NVE1 and Encap/Decap
   (Encapsulation/Decapsulation) on PE1, both perform the same
   functions; it is just a matter of using different terminologies in
   NVO3 framework [NVO3FRWK] and L3VPN [RFC4364].

   The DC and WAN networks may belong to different ASs. Control plane
   or management plane protocols can facilitate the VN configuration.
   Note: If an NVE is on a server and TESs are VMs on the server, it is
   no need any routing protocol between NVE and TESs; TES-NVE
   association is configured by DC operators. When a VM is "power-on",
   the NVE populates it in the forwarding table; When the VM is "power-
   off", the NVE removes it from the table. The forwarding between the
   NVE and TESs is simply an internal table lookup and delivery process
   on the server. If an NVE is on ToR, TESs may be either non-
   virtualized servers or VMs on virtualized servers. For the latter
   the routing between NVE and TESs may use Petro's proposal [ESYS] or
   a routing protocol such as OSPF per VN. The forwarding between two

   is like CE-PE's. Routing and forwarding between NVE1 and PE1 and
   between PE1 and CE in Figure 2 are as specified in RFC4364 [RFC4364].

4.2. NVO3 and VPN Interconnection at DC Gateway

   The DC Provider and Carrier may build a tenant VN and VPN for an
   enterprise customer independently and interconnect the two together
   at the DC GW. Figure 3 depicts this case. The GW supports both NVE
   and PE capability. Here an L3 VN instance is built between NVE1 and
   the NVE on DC GW and an L3VPN instance is configured on the PE of DC
   GW and PE1, respectively. The NVE on DC GW performs L3 VNI functions,
   NVO3 encapsulation, and tunneling toward the DC; it also performs
   L3VPN functions toward the WAN. Both L2 tunnel and LSP Tunnel
   terminate at the DC GW. The packets are processed at the L3 VNI on
   DC GW. Operators may choose use of one routing table for both
   instances as shown in the figure or they can choose one for each.

   This implementation is more complex than the one in figure 2.
   However it provides DC network and WAN network demarcation clearly
   and allows each network use of different VN implementations, which
   is necessary in some situations. Note: the nvo3 solution can be

   simpler than L3VPN [RFC4364] due to TES and NVE functionality.
   Furthermore, two VNs may use different address spaces and let DC GW
   to perform the address translation.

   The alternative of this case is to physically split the gateway
   function on to DC GW and WAN PE devices. In this case, the tenant
   instance is terminated on the DC GW and the L3VPN instance
   terminates at a PE in the WAN. An Ethernet interface is used to
   physically connect to the DC GW and PE devices and an Ethernet VLAN
   is configured on both devices for interconnecting two instances,
   which will be the same as VRF-Lite [VRF-LITE]

   Such interconnection may also apply to across multiple DC sites.
   During the migration process, it is possible that some portion of a
   DC site may be able to support NVE and the other may not. Such
   gateway function may be used to interconnect a tenant instance and a
   regular underlying VPN that provides the connectivity to the VMs
   belonging to the same tenant.

4.3. Connecting a DC Virtual Network via Internet

   A user may want to connect to a DC virtual network via Internet but
   securely. Figure 4 illustrates this case. A L3 virtual network is
   configured on NVE1 and NVE2 and two NVEs are connected via a L2
   tunnel in the Data Center. A set of tenant end systems attach to
   NVE1. The NVE2 connects to one (may be more) TES that runs the VN
   gateway and NAT applications. A user can access the VN via Internet
   by using IPsec.[RFC4301]  The encrypted tunnel is used between the
   VN GW and the user. The VN GW provides authentication scheme and
   encryption.

Internet-Draft          NVO3 Use Case                         June 2012

5. DC Applications Using NVO3

   NVO3 brings DC operators the flexibility to design different
   applications for DC operation purpose and/or DC customers. DC
   operators may build several virtual networks and interconnect them
   directly to form a tenant network. They may allocate some VMs to run
   tenant applications and some to run service applications such as
   Firewall, DNS for the tenant.[NVGRE] Two use cases are given in this
   section.

5.1. Tenant Network with Bridging/Routing and Internet Access

   Figure 5 depicts two DC sites. The site A constructs an L2VN that
   terminates on NVE1, NVE2, and GW1. The L2VN provides a simple LAN
   among TESs and the VNIF on GW1. It also configures an L3VNI on GW1
   to attach to TESs that run Firewall/NAT/SSLVPN and interconnect with
   GW2 in the site Z. GW1 is the members of the L2VN and L3VN; two VNs
   internally are interconnected on GW1 via Virtual Network
   Interconnection Interface (VNIF). The site Z has the similar
   configuration. Note that both the L2VN and L3VN in the figure are
   carried by the tunnels supported by the underlying networks which
   are not shown in the figure.

   This configuration provides a private cloud network in/across Data
   Center site A and Z and consists of three virtual networks. Within
   each Data Center, the L2VN provides the L2 connectivity to all the
   associated TESs and the GW. The GW1 or GW2 terminates the L2VN
   traffic and forwards the packets as IP packets to remote DC, which
   forms a private cloud network among all the TESs. The GW1 or GW2
   also forwards/receives the IP packets from TESs running
   firewall/NAT/SSLVPN; the TESs connect to Internet via DC underlying
   network. This lets the cloud network connecting to Internet in a
   secure way. DC operator can choose an address space for the cloud
   network and rely on the NAT application to perform address
   translation. This configuration allows a VM move within the L2VN but
   not across DCs due to different IP subnet on each GW.

5.2. Virtual Data Center

   Enterprise DC's today may often use several routers, switches, and
   service devices to construct its internal network, DMZ, and external
   network access. A DC Provider may offer a virtual DC to an
   enterprise customer to run enterprise applications such as
   website/emails. Instead of using many hardware devices, with the
   overlay and virtualization technology of NVO3, DC operators can
   build them on top of a common network infrastructure for many
   customers and run service applications per customer basis. The
   service applications may include firewall, gateway, DNS, load
   balancer, NAT, etc.

   Figure 6 below illustrates this scenario. For the simple
   illustration, it only shows the L3VN or L2VN as virtual and overlay
   routers or switches. In this case, DC operators construct several L2
   VNs (L2VNx, L2VNy, L2VNz in figure 6) to group the end tenant
   systems together per application basis, create an L3VNa for the
   internal routing. A server or VM runs firewall/gateway applications
   and connects to the L3VNa and Internet. A VPN tunnel is also built
   between the gateway and enterprise router. The design runs
   Enterprise Web/Mail/VoIP applications at the provider DC site; lets
   the users at Enterprise site to access the applications via the VPN

   tunnel and Internet via a gateway at the Enterprise site; let
   Internet users access the applications via the gateway in the
   provider DC. The enterprise operators can also use the VPN tunnel or
   IPsec over Internet to access the vDC for the management purpose.
   The firewall/gateway provides application-level and packet-level
   gateway function and/or NAT function.

   The Enterprise customer decides which applications are accessed by
   intranet only and which by both intranet and extranet; DC operators
   then design and configure the proper security policy and gateway
   function. DC operators may further set different QoS levels for the
   different applications for a customer.

   This application requires the NVO3 solution to provide the DC
   operator an easy way to create NVEs and VNIs for any design and to
   quickly assign TESs to a VNI, and easily configure policies on an
   NVE.

Internet-Draft          NVO3 Use Case                         June 2012

6. OAM Considerations

   NVO3 brings the ability for a DC provider to segregate tenant
   traffic. A DC provider needs to manage and maintain NVO3 instances.
   Similarly, the tenant needs to be informed about tunnel failures
   impacting tenant applications.

   Various OAM and SOAM tools and procedures are defined in [IEEE
   802.1ag, ITU-T Y.1731, RFC4378, ITU-T Y.1564] for L2 and L3
   networks, and for user, including continuity check, loopback, link
   trace, testing, alarms such as AIS/RDI, and on-demand and periodic
   measurements. These procedures may apply to tenant overlay networks
   and tenants not only for proactive maintenance, but also to ensure
   support of Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   As the tunnel traverses different networks, OAM messages need to be
   translated at the edge of each network to ensure end-to-end OAM.

   It is important that failures at lower layers which do not affect
   NVo3 instance are to be suppressed.

7. Summary

   The document intends to illustrate some basic potential use cases.
   The combination of these cases should give operators flexibility and
   power to design more sophisticated cases for various purposes.

   The main differences between other overlay network technologies and
   NVO3 is that the client edges of the NVO3 network are individual and
   virtualized hosts and not network sites or LANs. NVO3 no longer
   treats the physical computer as a client of the network but as a
   native service point of the network. The same operator manages both
   NVO3 network and its clients.

   NVO3 lets individual virtual network instances use their own address
   space and isolates the space from the network infrastructure. The
   approach not only segregates the traffic from multi tenants on a
   common infrastructure but also makes VM dynamic placement easier.

   DC applications are about providing virtual processing/storage,
   applications, and networking in a secured and virtualized manner, in
   which the NV03 is just a portion of an application. NVO3 decouples
   the applications and DC network infrastructure.

   NVO3's underlying network provides the tunneling between NVEs so
   that two NVEs appear as one hop to each other. Many tunneling
   technologies can serve this function. The tunneling may in turn be

   tunneled over other intermediate tunnels over the Internet or other
   WAN.  It is also possible that intra DC and inter DC tunnels are
   stitched together to form an end-to-end tunnel between two NVEs.

   A DC virtual network may be accessed via an external network in a
   secure way. Many existing technologies can achieve this.

   The key requirements for NVO3 are 1) traffic segregation; 2) support
   a large scale number of TESs in a virtual network; 3) VM mobility 4)
   auto or easy to construct a NVE and its associated TES; 5) Security
   6) NVO3 Management.

8. Security Considerations

   Security is a concern. DC operators need to provide a tenant a
   secured virtual network, which means the tenant traffic isolated
   from other tenant's and non-tenant VMs not placed into the tenant
   virtual network; they also need to prevent DC underlying network
   from any tenant application attacking through the tenant virtual
   network or one tenant application attacking another tenant
   application via DC networks. For example, a tenant application
   attempts to generate a large volume of traffic to overload DC
   underlying network. The NVO3 solution has to address these issues.
