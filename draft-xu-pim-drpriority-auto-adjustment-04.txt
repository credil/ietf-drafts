Internet-Draft     PIM-SM DR Priority Auto-Adjustment        June 2013 
 
Abstract 

   This document defines some mechanisms for automatically adjusting the 
   Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Designed Router (DR) priority 
   according to the status of the tracked interface. This approach can 
   be used to realize DR auto-switchover in case the DR loses the route 
   to multicast source or Rendezvous Point (RP).

Internet-Draft     PIM-SM DR Priority Auto-Adjustment        June 2013 
 
    
1. Problem Statement 

   In the Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) 
   specification [RFC4601], a Designated Routers (DR) plays a very 
   important role on the shared-media LAN like Ethernet which may have 
   more than one PIM-SM speaking routers and one or more hosts. One of 
   the PIM-SM speaking routers is designated aka elected (per interface) 
   to send (a) PIM join/prune messages upon receiving Internet Group 
   Management Protocol (IGMP) [RFC3376] membership report/leave messages 
   from multicast receivers/hosts, or (b) PIM Register packets to a 
   Rendezvous Point (RP) on behalf of the multicast senders. DR election 
   happens on all interfaces, LAN or otherwise. 

   To achieve DR redundancy, multiple PIM routers are usually deployed 
   in a shared-media LAN like Ethernet. As depicted in the following 
   figure, two PIM routers R1, R2 are connected to the same LAN where a 
   multicast receiver is located. Assume R1 is elected as the DR for 
   that LAN. Now R1's upstream link to the outside network is down, as a 
   result, R1 will lose the reachability to the multicast senders and/or 
   RPs. If R1 doesn't quit the DR role, the multicast service for the 
   receiver will be broken even though R2 may still have reachability to 
   the multicast senders and/or RPs.              

               |   +-----+    +------------------+ 
               +---+ R1  +----+                  | 
               |   +-----+    |                  | 
  +--------+   |              |                  |  +-------+ 
  |Receiver+---+              | Outside Network  +--+Sender | 
  +--------+   |              |   (Run PIM-SM)   |  +-------+ 
               |   +-----+    |                  | 
               +---+ R2  +----+                  | 
               |   +-----+    +------------------+ 
                 

   In most cases, the recovery of the multicast forwarding tree is 
   dependent on the unicast route convergence. However, in a topology 
   such as the one illustrated above, the (LAN) interface between R1 and 
   R2 is treated passive from the routing protocol perspective for 
   obvious reasons (flooding, scale, spoofing etc.), mooting the unicast 
   routing convergence applicability.  

   While it is possible that a failover static route can be configured 
   on these two routers instead of running IGP, that's to say, each PIM 
   router is configured with a default route with its next-hop pointed 
   to the opposite side, and this default route will not take effect 
   until the reachability to the outside network is lost. However, this 
   approach has a few side-effects. Assume these two routers are

   connected to the same Internet Service Provider (ISP) network via 
   different links, once the default route learnt from the ISP is 
   withdrawn, the forwarding loop will occur between them upon receiving 
   a packet whose best route is the configured default route. Another 
   side-effect with this approach is when the upstream link to the 
   outside network recovers (from down to up), the RPF interface will 
   change. As a result, the transient forwarding interruption due to 
   SPT/RPT rebuilding will occur. Although this transient interruption 
   issue due to the unicast route change can be alleviated by using some 
   make-before-break mechanism (e.g., by borrowing some ideas from RPT-
   >SPT switch mechanism, the old upstream link will not be pruned until 
   the stream is received from the new upstream link.), the cost is 
   relatively high for this scenario. 

2. DR Priority Auto-adjustment Mechanism 

   A PIM router could exactly cease the DR role by decreasing its DR 
   priority once it loses routes to the RPs or multicast sources. Since 
   the addresses of the RPs or the multicast sources may not be known to 
   it, the PIM router could simply determine whether or not it has lost 
   the route to the RPs or multicast sources just by tracking the status 
   of its upstream link. This approach is much similar to the interface 
   tracking mechanism of the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) 
   [RFC2338]. Taken the above scenario as an example, R1 will track its 
   upstream link to the outside network, once the upstream link is down, 
   its PIM DR priority will be reduced automatically so as to cease the 
   DR role. As a result, R2 will take over the DR role. To speed up the 
   DR switchover further, as soon as the DR priority adjustment occurs, 
   a new hello message containing the current DR priority will be 
   triggered. 

   In most cases, two last-hop routers each with an upstream link are 
   enough for redundancy purpose. In case there are more than one 
   upstream links on a PIM router, all of these interfaces should be 
   tracked for the DR priority adjustment. As long as there is a route 
   to the outside network, it is not necessary for the DR switchover to 
   take place. However, if the number of uplink interfaces is large, the 
   network administrator can actually choose part of uplinks which are 
   to be tracked for the DR adjustment. 

   Once the failed upstream link on R1 recovers (from down to up), its 
   DR priority can be either recovered to the original value or not 
   according to the pre-configured preemption policy. If preemption is 
   not allowed, its DR priority will remain unchanged so as to avoid 
   unnecessary DR switchover. As a result, the transient multicast 
   forwarding interruption due to multicast forwarding tree rebuilding 
   can be avoided. Once the current DR fails or its DR priority changes,

   the non-DRs SHOULD restore theirs DR priorities to their original 
   value provided they have got route to the uplinks for competing in a 
   new round of DR election.  

   In fact, if VRRP is run on the PIM routers and the VRRP has enabled 
   the upstream link tracking mechanism, the PIM DR failover mechanism 
   could be coupled with the VRRP so as to reuse the upstream link 
   tracking mechanism of VRRP. One option is to synchronize the PIM DR 
   priority value to the VRRP priority value always. In this way, the 
   PIM DR and the VRRP master will always run on an identical router if 
   the VRRP Preempt_Mode is set to True. Another option is to make the 
   PIM DR and the VRRP master run on an identical router anyway (i.e., 
   regardless whether or not the VRRP Preempt_Mode is True). To achieve 
   this goal, the PIM DR priority of the VRRP master router SHOULD 
   always be set to a higher fixed value than that of the VRRP slave 
   router automatically.  

   Note that these approaches are fully compatible with the current PIM 
   specification. There is no need to change the PIM protocol on wire at 
   all since they are just internal implementations.  

   Although the PIM router could cease the DR role by declaring its 
   death directly, e.g., sending a hello message with a zero HoldTime, 
   or keeping silent till it times out, this approach has a few 
   limitations in some specific scenarios. Taking the above scenario as 
   an example, assume there is another multicast sender directly 
   connected to R1 via another interface. Since the receiver and this 
   sender are connected to the same PIM router, the receiver ought to be 
   able to receive the multicast stream from this sender. However, in 
   case there is another multicast source in the outside network using 
   the same address (i.e., in anycast source scenario), a problem due to 
   PIM assert failure will occur since join/prune or assert messages 
   from a non-neighbor will be discarded silently according to the PIM 
   specification. 

3. Security Considerations 

   The DR priority auto-adjustment mechanisms described in this document 
   does not introduce any new security risk. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   There is no IANA consideration for this document.
