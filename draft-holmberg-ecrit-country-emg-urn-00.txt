Internet-Draft     country specific emergency services     February 2013


1.  Introduction

   Table 1 shows the policy for registration of sub-services of the
   service URN with the 'sos' service type as defined in RFC 5031
   [RFC5031] section 4.2.

   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an  |
   | immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the  |
   | government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services |
   | can be added after expert review and must be of general public    |
   | interest and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is      |
   | designated by the ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in      |
   | their absence, the IESG.  The expert review should only approve   |
   | emergency services that are offered widely and in different       |
   | countries, with approximately the same caller expectation in      |
   | terms of services rendered.  The 'sos' service is not meant to    |
   | invoke general government, public information, counseling, or     |
   | social services.                                                  |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

                Table 1: Excerpt from RFC 5031 section 4.2.

   Some existing emergency services are offered in one country only.
   Examples are the "Reporting spies" emergency service offered in South
   Korea and the "GAULA (anti-kidnapping)" emergency service offered in
   Colombia according to
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number

   Moreover, emergency services to be defined in future can initially be
   introduced in one country only.

   The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with
   the 'sos' service type as shown in Table 1 which requires the
   emergency service to be "offered widely and in different countries,
   with approximately the same caller expectation in terms of services
   rendered" cannot be not fulfilled for the emergency services
   identified above.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft     country specific emergency services     February 2013


3.  Definitions

   Country specific emergency service: an emergency service offered in
   one country only.


4.  Problem statement

   The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with
   the 'sos' service type as defined in RFC 5031 [RFC5031] prevents
   registration of a sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos'
   service type for the country specific emergency service.


5.  Requirement

   REQ-1: It MUST be possible to register with IANA a sub-service of the
   service URN with the 'sos' service type as defined in RFC 5031
   [RFC5031] for the country specific emergency service.


6.  Solution

6.1.  Service URN assignment

   A country specific emergency service is identified by the service URN
   with the 'sos' service type as defined in RFC 5031 [RFC5031] with:
   o  the first sub-service set to 'country-specific';
   o  the second sub-service identifying the country where the emergency
      service is deployed.  The format of second sub-service is an ISO
      3166-1 alpha-2 code as specified in ISO 3166-1; and
   o  the third sub-service uniquely identifying the emergency service
      in the country where the emergency service is deployed.  The value
      of the third sub-service is assigned by the public safety
      answering point (PSAP) offering the country specific emergency
      service.

   Example: urn:service:sos.country-specific.xy.567 can identify an
   emergency service identified by an emergency number 567 in a country
   identified by "xy" ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code as specified in ISO
   3166-1.

6.2.  IANA Considerations

6.2.1.  'country-specific' sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos'
        service type

   urn:service:sos.country-specific This service identifier has the same

Internet-Draft     country specific emergency services     February 2013


   semantic as the urn:service:sos.

   Note: this sub-service is added to enable different registration
   policies for the country specific emergency services.

6.2.2.  country identifying sub-service of the service URN with the
        'sos' service type and with the 'country-specific' sub-service

   service URN with the 'sos' service type, with the 'country-specific'
   first sub-service and with second sub-service indicating the country
   identified by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code as specified in ISO 3166-1 has
   the same semantic as the urn:service:sos.  IANA is requested to
   register URN for each country identified by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code
   as specified in ISO 3166-1.

   Note: this sub-service is added to ensure uniqueness of URNs for the
   country specific emergency services.

6.2.3.  service URN for country specific emergency service

   A sub-service identifying a country specific emergency service can be
   added to the service URN with the 'sos' service type, with the
   'country-specific' first sub-service and with country identifying
   second sub-service.

   The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with
   the 'sos' service type, with the 'country-specific' first sub-service
   and with country identifying second sub-service is "Expert Review" as
   defined in RFC 5226 [RFC5226].

   The expert review should only approve emergency service that is
   offered by a public safety answering point (PSAP) in the country
   identified by the second sub-service of the service URN being
   registered.  The emergency service is not required to be "offered
   widely and in different countries, with approximately the same caller
   expectation in terms of services rendered".

   The expert is designated by the ECRIT working group, its successor,
   or, in their absence, the IESG.
