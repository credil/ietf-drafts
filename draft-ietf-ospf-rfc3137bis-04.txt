                     draft-ietf-ospf-rfc3137bis-04

Abstract

   This document describes a backward-compatible technique that may be
   used by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implementations to advertise
   a router's unavailability to forward transit traffic, or to lower the
   preference level for the paths through such a router.

   This document obsoletes [RFC3137].

1.  Introduction

   In some situations, it may be advantageous to inform routers in a
   network not to use a specific router as a transit point, but still
   route to it.  Possible situations include the following:

   o  The router is in a critical condition (for example, has very high
      CPU load or does not have enough memory to store all Link State
      Advertisements (LSAs) or build the routing table).

   o  Graceful introduction and removal of the router to/from the
      network.

   o  Other (administrative or traffic engineering) reasons.

Internet-Draft       OSPF Stub Router Advertisement           April 2013


   Note that the solution introduced in this document does not remove
   the router from the topology view of the network (as could be done by
   just flushing that router's router-LSA), but discourages other
   routers from using it for transit routing, while still routing
   packets to the router's own IP addresses, i.e., the router is
   announced as a stub.

   It must be emphasized that the solution provides real benefits in
   networks designed with at least some level of redundancy so that
   traffic can be routed around the stub router.  Otherwise, traffic
   destined for the networks reachable through such a stub router may
   still be routed through it.

2.  Solutions

   The solution introduced in this document solves two challenges
   associated with the outlined problem.  In the description below,
   router X is the router announcing itself as a stub.

   1)  Making other routers prefer routes around router X while
      performing the Dijkstra calculation.

   2)  Allowing other routers to reach IP prefixes directly connected to
      router X.

   Note that it would be easy to address issue 1) alone by just flushing
   router X's router-LSA from the domain.  However, it does not solve
   problem 2), since other routers will not be able to use links to
   router X in Dijkstra (no back link), and because router X will not
   have links to its neighbors.

   To address both problems, router X announces its router-LSA to the
   neighbors with the costs of all non-stub links (links of the types
   other than 3) set to MaxLinkMetric (defined in Section 3).

   The solution above applies to both OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3
   [RFC5340].

2.1.  OSPFv3-only Solution

   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] introduced additional options to provide similar
   control of the forwarding topology; the R-bit provides an indication
   of whether a router is active and should be used for transit traffic.

   It is left to network operators to decide which technique to use in
   their network.  See Section 4 for more details.

3.  Maximum Link Metric

   Section 2 refers to the cost of all non-stub links as MaxLinkMetric,
   which is a new fixed architectural value introduced in this document.

   MaxLinkMetric
      The metric value indicating that the link described by an LSA
      should not be used as transit.  Used in router-LSAs (see
      Section 2).  It is defined to be the 16-bit binary value of all
      ones: 0xffff.

4.  Deployment Considerations

   When using MaxLinkMetric, some inconsistency may be seen if the
   network is constructed of routers that perform intra-area Dijkstra
   calculation as specified in [RFC1247] (discarding link records in
   router-LSAs that have a MaxLinkMetric cost value) and routers that
   perform it as specified in [RFC1583] and higher (do not treat links
   with MaxLinkMetric cost as unreachable).  Note that this
   inconsistency will not lead to routing loops, because if there are
   some alternate paths in the network, both types of routers will agree
   on using them rather than the path through the stub router.  If the
   path through the stub router is the only one, the routers of the
   first type will not use the stub router for transit (which is the
   desired behavior), while the routers of the second type will still
   use this path.

   On the other hand, clearing the R-bit will consistently result in the
   router not being used as transit.

   The use of MaxLinkMetric or the R-bit in a network depends on the
   objectives of the operator.  One of the possible considerations for
   selecting one or the other is in the desired behavior if the path
   through the stub router is the only one available.  Using
   MaxLinkMetric allows for that path to be used, while the R-bit
   doesn't.

5.  Security Considerations

   The technique described in this document does not introduce any new
   security issues into the OSPF protocol.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Changes from RFC3137

   This document obsoletes [RFC3137].

   In addition to editorial updates, this documents defines a new
   architectural constant (MaxLinkMetric in Section 3) to eliminate any
   confusion about the interpretation of LSInfinity.  It also
   incorporates and explains the use of the R-bit [RFC5340] as a
   solution to the problem addressed in the text.

Appendix B.  Change Log

   This section should be removed by the RFC Editor before publication.
