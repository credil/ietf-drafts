   1. Introduction

   Content Providers (CP) are experiencing significant growth in demand
   for all types of internet-based content. A single "over-the-top" CP
   would require significant resources to deliver content that could be
   requested from anywhere in the world. Service Providers (SP) are
   taking advantage of this situation by forming Content Distribution
   Network (CDN) Federations for the purpose of distributing content on

   behalf of Content Providers (CP). There are several advantages to
   such CDN Federations:

   o  CPs can simply contract with one or more SPs in a CDN Federation
      for delivery of their content. This enables CPs to concentrate on
      their main objective - creation of content.

   o  SPs can expand their geographic reach via distribution agreements
      with Federation members without developing costly resources
      outside their local territories.

   Multicast-based delivery mechanisms are a natural fit for content
   distribution in the proposed CDN Federations. The scope of this
   document is strictly focused on the interactions between CDN
   Federation members to support multicast-based content distribution.
   The purpose of this document is the detailed examination of
   applicable multicast techniques and the identification of detailed
   data/metadata/parameters that will have to be exchanged by CDN
   Federation members to enable multicast-based content distribution.

   2. CDN Nomenclature and High Level Overview

   Terminology utilized to describe end-to-end user requests is
   described as follows.

   There are many entities involved in distribution of the content from
   the CP all the way to the End User (EU). Figure 1 is a diagram
   depicting the basic logical relationships among the various roles
   involved in content delivery. Besides the CP and EU, the two
   remaining major entities are the two members of a CDN Federation -
   the Primary CDN Provider (P-CDN) and the Supporting CDN Provider (S-
   CDN) [A-0200003]. The relationships between these entities are as
   follows - see Figure 1.

   1. The Content Provider owns the content and specifies conditions of
      delivery and use. The End User interacts with the CP (link 1 in
      the figure) for authentication and authorization, and to reach an
      agreement to obtain specific content (content selection, content
      purchase, acknowledgement of conditions of use). The CP has the
      legal right to distribute content and specify conditions for
      distribution.

   2. The CP has an agreement and interacts with the P-CDN for deploying
      content (link 2). The content is assumed to be retrieved by the P-
      CDN from the CP Origin server.

   3. The P-CDN in turn has an agreement with an S-CDN for deploying and
      distributing content (link 3).

   4. The End User is attached to S-CDN for access and obtains the
      content from the S-CDN (link 4). The End User also interacts with
      the CP (link 1) as indicated above.

         +---------+     +---------+     +---------+     +---------+

               Figure 1 - Relationships in a CDN Federation

   Note that all SPs in the CDN Federation can play the role of P-CDN
   (active relationship with a CP) as well as an S-CDN (attach EUs and
   distribute content from P-CDN to EUs).

   Using the above nomenclature, a CDN Federation is assumed to comprise
   multiple SPs that agree to function as CDN Providers and distribute
   content to End Users on behalf of CPs. The term 'SP' in this context
   is synonymous with the term 'CDN Provider' for the purpose of this
   document. A CP is assumed to have a contract with one or more SPs for
   the purpose of content delivery. A high level content request flow is
   described as follows:

     o  An End User discovers a specific content on a CP website and
        requests delivery of the same. The CP selects one CDN Provider
        with whom it has contracts for content delivery. The rules for
        CDN Provider selection are part of the CP . CDN Provider
        contract and are out of scope for this document. The selected
        CDN Provider functions as the P-CDN.

     o  The P-CDN then determines the mode of content delivery - either
        cache/unicast or multicast depending on the type of content and
        its own capabilities and resources. It then determines whether
        to deliver the content directly to the End User or utilize
        another CDN Provider based on rules such as proximity, available
        resources, common delivery methods (e.g., multicast), etc. These
        selection rules are out of scope of this document. In case
        another CDN Provider is selected, then that entity assumes the
        role of the S-CDN.

     o  The P-CDN then initiates the delivery process via the S-CDN's
        domain - the S-CDN acts as the "point of delivery" to the End
        User.

   The simple scenario described here is common to both delivery
   mechanisms - cache/unicast as well as multicast. The purpose of this
   document is to address all multicast related aspects in support of
   multicast-based content delivery.

   3. Multicast Use Cases for a CDN-I Federation

   Use cases involving multicast methods for distributing content in a
   CDN Federation have been described in [A-0200004].

   3.1. Native Multicast Architectural Use Case

      -------------------               -------------------

   | | CS |------>|  BR  |-|---------|->|  BR  |-------------|--->| EU |

    \                     /           \                     /
     \                   /             \                   /
      -------------------               -------------------

   CS = Content Multicast Source (assumes that the Content Source
      retrieves content from CP Origin)
   BR = Border Router
   I1 = P-CDN and S-CDN Multicast Interconnection (MBGP or BGMP)
   I2 = S-CDN and EU Multicast Connection

   This case assumes that both CDN Providers as well as the
   interconnection between them and the connection between the EU and S-
   CDN are all multicast enabled.

   3.2. A variation of this "pure" Native Multicast case is when the
      interconnection I1 between the CDNs is multicast enabled via a
      Generic Routing Encapsulation Tunnel (GRE) [RFC2784] and
      encapsulating the multicast protocols across the interface.
      Automatic Multicast Tunneling Architectural Use Cases

   In reality, the initial introduction of multicast may not be fully
   multicast enabled resulting in "Multicast Islands" requiring
   Automatic Multicast Tunnels (AMT) for enabling multicast connections
   between them [IETF-ID-AMT].

   3.2.1. AMT Interconnection Between P-CDN and S-CDN

      -------------------               -------------------
     /       P-CDN       \             /       S-CDN       \
    / (Multicast Enabled) \           / (Multicast Enabled) \
   /                       \         /                       \
   | +----+                |         |                       |
   | |    |       +------+ |         |  +------+             |    +----+
   | | CS |------>|  AR  |-|---------|->|  AG  |-------------|--->| EU |
   | |    |       +------+ |   I1    |  +------+             | I2 +----+
   \ +----+                /         \                       /
    \                     /           \                     /
     \                   /             \                   /
      -------------------               -------------------

   AR = AMT Relay
   AG = AMT Gateway
   I1 = AMT Interconnection between P-CDN and S-CDN
   I2 = S-CDN and EU Multicast Connection

          Figure 3 - AMT Interconnection between P-CDN and S-CDN

   This configuration assumes both CDN Providers are multicast enabled.
   Only the interconnection between them is not multicast enabled and
   hence, an AMT tunnel is established between them as shown in Figure
   3.

   3.2.2. AMT Tunnel Connecting S-CDN and EU

   /                       \         /                       \

   CS = Content Server
   BR = Border Router
   AR = AMT Relay
   I1 = P-CDN and S-CDN Multicast Interconnection (MBGP or BGMP)
   I2 = AMT Connection between S-CDN and EU

               Figure 4 - AMT Tunnel Connecting S-CDN and EU

   This case involves EU devices that are not multicast enabled. Hence
   an AMT Tunnel is established between the S-CDN AMT Relay and the EU
   device. This implies one tunnel per EU - potentially several AMT
   tunnels may need to be setup.
   Note that there could be configurations involving both situations
   described in 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.

   3.2.3. AMT Tunnel Connecting EU to P-CDN Through Non-Multicast S-CDN

   This Use Case assumes that EU attached to the non-multicast enabled
   S-CDN has a device populated with a client that establishes an AMT
   tunnel to the AMT Relay in the P-CDN.

   This configuration is needed when the S-CDN is not multicast-enabled.
   This is the most "extreme" AMT case as the length of the tunnels as
   well as the number of tunnels can be large.

   4. Content Types Suitable for Multicast-based CDN

   This section highlights applications and content types that are
   suitable for multicast-based delivery in a CDN Federation. Any unique
   aspects of specific applications/content types that require special
   attention are duly noted.

   Note: Suggest we put in content types in tabular form followed by
   this text:

   For the purpose of this document, live streaming is chosen as a
   typical multicast application for content distribution via a CDN
   Federation. Note that a definition of live streaming needs to be
   provided.



   5. Evaluation of Existing Multicast Protocols to Support CDN-I

   Use Case 3.1 describes Native Multicast configurations. This is the
   "simplest" multicast case in that a single standard set of protocols
   supports end-to-end content delivery from the CP to EU via two or
   more fully multicast-enabled CDN Providers. It also provides for
   efficient use of bandwidth and resources.

Internet-Draft  Multicast Considerations in Support of CDN-I    October
2012


   Use Case 3.2.1 does deploy an AMT Tunnel for interconnecting two CDN
   Providers; the rest of the configuration is Native Multicast - this
   assumes that the EU devices are also multicast-enabled.

   Thus existing Multicast capabilities need to be examined to determine
   their ability to fully support content distribution in a CDN
   Federation. A list of issues requiring examination is as follows:

   o  Delivery - Identification and communication of {Source, Group}
      information and DNS information for provisioning across CDNs.
      Details to be provided.

   o  Routing/Peering - Identification and acknowledgement of external
      IP addresses particularly when utilizing a GRE Tunnel for
      interconnecting CDNs. Details to be provided.

   o  Back-Office Functions - Identification of appropriate
      data/metadata collected by Native Multicast to support usage of
      content for billing, settlements, logging, etc. Details to be
      provided.

   o  Security - Determine ability of Native Multicast to deal with
      security risks such as bot attacks, denial of service, etc.
      Details to be provided.  Also,  EU authentication and
      authorization

   o  Others - To Be Determined

5.1. Use Case 3.1

   In this Use Case, with E-T-E multicast connectivity, the P-CDN
   provides source, routing and reporting functionality.  The S-CDN
   provides routing and reporting functions.

   Though the CP is the origin the interface between the origin and the
   MC source is out of scope.


   Issues:

   -what about performance and reliability "tricks" that may be employed
   do we address here?

   -Moving from network to network?  Addressed in separate RFC

   -IPv4 to IPv6 (assumption) not addressed or in scope - need to
   reference a standard if there is one

   -expand definition of S-CDN???



5.1.1. Delivery

   1) If there exists end to end multicast between the EU and the MC
     Source, then IGMP/MLD,  PIM and MBGP protocols will ensure the
     content stream is delivered to the requesting EU.

   2) The (S,G) and in fact all parameters required by the application
     related to the requested stream can be obtained by the client
     application in a number of ways.  None of which affects the MC
     protocols and generally neither are the delivery mechanisms of the
     parameters mutually exclusive.  Examples are:

        a.  Upon selecting (clicking a link) on a web page for MC
          content a file (Manifest file) is delivered via unicast to
          the EU from the web page

        b.  An HTTP reply from the web page to the EU request may
          contain the required parameters

        c.  An application may be "programmed" with the (S,G) and other
          parameters.  This method would require that the parameters
          remain fairly static/stable.

        d.  An application may even require an EU to enter the (S,G) and
          other parameters manually

   3) There are a number of ways to control and communicate parameters
     to the EU that direct the EU to the appropriate MC source.  Eg.

        a.  The (S,G) can be FQDNs in which case DNS can be used to
          select specific (S,G) address set.

        b.  When the EU selects the stream from the web page the
          parameters forwarded back to to the EU can be selected based
          on criteria related to the EU such as source IP,  EU SP.
          Decisions are driven by

            i. Business relationship to the EU and/or EU CDN

           ii. Geographic location of SP

          iii. On-net or off-net EU

           iv. MC network conditions

            v. TOD

           vi. Etc

        c.  In ETE MC any intervening (transit) network or SP should not
          make any attempt to change parameters forwarded to the EU
          from the serving CDN.

            i. Only a selected and participating S-CDN SP should,  if
               required,  intercept and change any MC parameters
               forwarded to the EU.  There should be agreement between
               the participating CDNs that this is permissible.

           ii. If the S-CDN changes parameters this should be recorded
               and reported to the upstream (P-CDN) CDN.

                  1. Generally reporting to the P-CDN will not be
                    required in real time

                  2. TBD  = situations where it should be Real Time or
                    near RT

          iii. An S-CDN should generally avoid unilaterally intercepting
               and changing parameters values sent from an upstream
               participating CDN (e.g. P-CDN)because this may cause
               problems such as the following examples:

                  1. Performance issues in delivery to the EU

                  2. Conflicting/erroneous parameter values

                  3. Conflicting/erroneous authentication, authorization
                    or accounting



   4) The MC Source application, which in the case of ETE is the P-CDN,
     should employ techniques to ensure reliable deliver of the content
     to the UE.  The methodology or combination of methodologies will
     often depend on the content type being delivered. There are

     several effective methods currently available, of which a few
     examples are described below:

        a.  Carrouselling

        b.  FEC

        c.  Parallel streaming

        d.  Grid or burst severs

        e.  Unicast fallback



5.1.2. Routing and Peering

   1) Routing between CDNi federation participants should be on a pair-
     wise agreement and implementation

   2) Route/peering preferences of the S-CDN should be communicated to
     the P-CDN - how can this be done??????  How necessary is it?

        a.  Allow S-CDN to have some ability to balance peering traffic

        b.  Route around congestion.

   3) CDNi participants must ensure that advertisement of the Source IP
     address is provided across the peering interface.

        a.  If an Anycast address is to be used for the Source, then
          participants must coordinate use of the Anycast address
          space.

        b.  Coordination of the address space should be spelled out in
          the participating members business arrangement/agreement

        c.  Coordination can occur in a pair-wise manner,  but each CDN
          with multiple arrangements must ensure that there are no
          conflicts introduced into any individual arrangement.

   4) If the peering interface is not multicast enabled a GRE tunnel
     should be provisioned between the CDNi participants

        a.  Source IP must be advertised across the GRE tunnel

        b.  The GRE tunnel may be provisioned to be terminated on
          participants border routers

        c.  Alternatively, the P-CDN may desire to terminate the GRE
          directly to the Source.  This will allow the P-CDN to have a
          separate IP address for external and internal EUs.

   5) Is there a way a P-CDN can instruct a S-CDN router to not
     broadcast its IGMP group memberships across its subnet?????

        a.  How is that communicated to the router

        b.  Is it a provisioning only option

        c.  Or can it be interactively done via some protocol message?



5.1.3. Back Office Functions



5.1.4. Security



5.2. Use Case 3.2.1 (AMT only across the peering interface)

5.2.1. Delivery

   All the recommended practices of 5.1.1 are applicable,  plus the
   following additional:

   1) The P-CDN and S-CDN should each deploy and provision an AMT Relay
     at their respective peering interface(s)

   2) These AMT Relay must also include and AMT Gateway (GW) function

   3) The P-CDN and S-CDN must have an agreement that allows the S-CDN
     to advertise the Source IP address across the S-CDN multicast
     enabled network.

   4) If the AMT interface fails or is out of service the P-CDN and S-
     CDN interface agreement should include provision for unicast
     failover.

5.2.2. Routing and Peering

   1) The GW function in the S-CDN AMT Relay can be provisioned with the
     proper address (this may be an Anycast address) of the P-CDN AMT
     Relay with connectivity to the source.  Alternatively, if the MC
     source IP (or Anycast address) is not provisioned then a mechanism
     for the GW function to find the P-CDN Relay with connectivity to
     the source must be available

        a.  A recommended mechanism for the GW to find the correct Relay
          is documented in "the RFC draft being constructed"

        b.  The P-CDN and S-CDN agreements should cover the methodology
          used

        c.  The agreement should specify how notification of MC Source
          IP is communicated (including timing)
