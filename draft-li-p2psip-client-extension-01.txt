Internet-Draft           RELOAD Client Extension            October 2011


1.  Introduction

   RELOAD base draft [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] has defined the client
   behavior and two ways to route message to client.  One way is using
   the responsible peer of client's Node ID's as access peer, the other
   way is using arbitary peer as access peer.  Using arbitary peer
   allows client to choose a access peer better than its responsible
   peer in terms of RTT, load.  If a node wants to send RELOAD message
   to a client using arbitary peer as access peer, the node must know
   both the client's node ID and the client's access peer's node ID.
   SIP usage draft [I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip] defines how SIP application
   publishes and obtains the route to SIP user's node (peer or client).
   However, some client related mechanisms are not described or detailed
   in these drafts.  This draft describes the mechanisms of multiple
   access peers, backup access peer and switching access peer.  This
   draft also proposes additional ways to route message to client.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   We use the terminology and definitions from the RELOAD base protocol
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] extensively in this document.


3.  Multiple Access Peers

   Mutiple access peers allow load sharing and avoid single point of
   failure.  If a sender (say node A) wants to send message to the
   client, it first obtains the client's node ID and access peer list
   via some kind of mechanism.  For example, the client stores its
   access peer list and node ID in the overlay using some kind of usage,
   and A fetches the list from overlay.  Then A sends message to next
   hop with destination list containing a chosen access peer's node ID
   and the client's node ID.

   The access peer in destination list may be chosen from access peer
   list randomly or based on some kind of criterion like the capacity of
   access peer, the distance from sender's node ID to access peer's node
   ID, etc.  If sending fails due to the failing of an access peer,
   sender can choose another access peer's node ID to reconstruct
   destination list and send the message again.  An example of using
   multiple access peers is shown in the figure below.

4.  Backup Access Peer

4.1.  Using Responsible Peer as Access Peer

   A client may attachs to both its responsible peer and responsible
   peer backup.  The responsible peer backup is the peer would be
   responsible for the client's node ID, if the client's current
   responsible peer fails.  If the RELOAD overlay uses CHORD algorithm,
   the responsible peer backup is the successor of responsible peer.  As
   shown in the figure below, with this backup mechanism, messages
   destinated to the client can be automatically sent to the client via
   responsible peer backup if responsible peer fails.

4.2.  Using Arbitrary Peer as Access Peer

   In RELOAD base draft, a client's access peer is located via access
   peer's ID if the client using arbitrary peer as its access peer.
   This document proposes to locate an access peer with a resource ID
   named access resource ID.  Client uses the response peer of access
   resource ID as access peer, and attaches to the backup response peer
   of access resource ID, which acts as the client's backup access peer.
   With a destination list containing a client's access resource ID and
   the client's node ID, messages can be routed to the client.  If
   current access peer fails, messages sent to the client still be
   routed by its backup access peer.
                                                            E        Z

 |                    |                     |               | Attach |

 |------------------->|                     |               |        |
 |Dest=D(as res ID),Z |                    \|/              |        |
 |                    |-------------------->X               |        |
 |                    |Dest=D(as res ID),Z / \              |        |
 |                    |                                     |        |
 |                    |------------------------------------>|        |
 |                    |         Dest=D(as res ID),Z         |        |
 |                    |                                     |------->|
 |                    |                                     | Dest=Z |

   An example is shown in above figure.  In this example, the RELOAD
   overlay uses CHORD algorithm, and client Z's access peer is node D.
   Client Z publishes its node ID and access resource ID D, which is
   equal to node D's node ID.  Messages sent to Z are all routed via
   node D unless D fails.  If node D fails, messages sent to Z will be
   routed via node D's backup node E.


5.  Direct Routing to Client or Access Peer

   As shown in the figure below, if a client is publicly accessible,
   messages can be routed from the sender to the client directly.  To
   send messages to the client, the sender first obtains the client's IP
   address via some kind of mechanism.  For example, the client stores
   its IP address and node ID in the overlay using some kind of usage,
   and the sender fetches them from overlay.  Then the sender sends
   RELOAD messages to the client directly.

   As shown in the figure below, if a client's access peer is publicly
   accessible, messages can be routed from the sender to the client's
   access peer directly, and the client's access peer route messages to
   the client .  To send messages to the client, the sender first
   obtains the client's access peer's IP address via some kind of
   mechanism.  For example, the client stores its access peer's IP
   address and node ID in the overlay using some kind of usage, and the
   sender fetches them from overlay.  Then the sender sends RELOAD
   messages to the client's access peer directly.
