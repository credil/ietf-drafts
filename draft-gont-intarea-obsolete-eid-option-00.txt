            Obsoleting the Endpoint Identifier (EID) Option
               draft-gont-intarea-obsolete-eid-option-00

Abstract

   This document formally obsoletes the IPv6 Endpoint Identification
   (EID) option (hex value 0x8a), thus cleaning up the corresponding
   IANA registry, and possibly serving as a basis for providing advice
   about the filtering of packets containing this option.

Internet-Draft          Obsoleting the EID Option             April 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Endpoint Identification option (hex value 0x8a) [EID-OPTION] was
   meant to be used with the Nimrod routing architecture [NIMROD-DOC],
   but has never seen widespread deployment.  Therefore, this document
   instructs IANA to change the "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop
   Options" registry [IANA-IPV6-PARAMETERS] accordingly, marking option
   0x8a as "Obsolete".

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to mark option 0x8a in the "Destination Options and
   Hop-by-Hop Options" registry [IANA-IPV6-PARAMETERS] as "Deprecated",
   with a reference to this RFC.
