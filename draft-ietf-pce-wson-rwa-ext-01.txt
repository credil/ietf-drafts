Abstract

   This document provides the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength
   Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON).
   Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength
   assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation perspective,
   wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength
   can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing
   constraint to optical light path computation.

1. Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655], and
   [RFC5440].

2. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



3. Introduction

   [RFC4655] defines a PCE based path computation architecture and
   explains how a Path Computation Element (PCE) may compute Label
   Switched Paths (LSP) in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic
   Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks at the
   request of Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  A PCC is said to be any
   network component that makes such a request and may be, for
   instance, an Optical Switching Element within a Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (WDM) network.  The PCE, itself, can be located
   anywhere within the network, and may be within an optical switching
   element, a Network Management System (NMS) or Operational Support
   System (OSS), or may be an independent network server.

   The PCE communications Protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol
   used between a PCC and a PCE, and may also be used between
   cooperating PCEs.  [RFC4657] sets out the common protocol
   requirements for PCEP.  Additional application-specific requirements
   for PCEP are deferred to separate documents.

   Optical Networks (WSON) based on the requirements specified in [PCE-
   RWA].

   WSON refers to WDM based optical networks in which switching is
   performed selectively based on the wavelength of an optical signal.
   In this document, it is assumed that wavelength converters require
   electrical signal regeneration. Consequently, WSONs can be
   transparent (A transparent optical network is made up of optical
   devices that can switch but not convert from one wavelength to
   another, all within the optical domain) or translucent (3R
   regenerators are sparsely placed in the network).

   A LSC Label Switched Path (LSP) may span one or several transparent
   segments, which are delimited by 3R regenerators (typically with
   electronic regenerator and optional wavelength conversion). Each
   transparent segment or path in WSON is referred to as an optical
   path. An optical path may span multiple fiber links and the path
   should be assigned the same wavelength for each link. In such case,
   the optical path is said to satisfy the wavelength-continuity
   constraint. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between a LSC LSP
   and transparent segments (optical paths).

   Note that two optical paths within a WSON LSP need not operate on
   the same wavelength (due to the wavelength conversion capabilities).
   Two optical paths that share a common fiber link cannot be assigned
   the same wavelength.  To do otherwise would result in both signals
   interfering with each other. Note that advanced additional
   multiplexing techniques such as polarization based multiplexing are
   not addressed in this document since the physical layer aspects are

   wavelength on a lightpath is an essential requirement in the optical
   path computation process.

   When a switching node has the ability to perform wavelength
   conversion, the wavelength-continuity constraint can be relaxed, and
   a LSC Label Switched Path (LSP) may use different wavelengths on
   different links along its route from origin to destination. It is,
   however, to be noted that wavelength converters may be limited due
   to their relatively high cost, while the number of WDM channels that
   can be supported in a fiber is also limited. As a WSON can be
   composed of network nodes that cannot perform wavelength conversion,
   nodes with limited wavelength conversion, and nodes with full
   wavelength conversion abilities, wavelength assignment is an
   additional routing constraint to be considered in all lightpath
   computation.

   For example (see Figure 1), within a translucent WSON, a LSC LSP may
   be established between interfaces I1 and I2, spanning 2 transparent
   segments (optical paths) where the wavelength continuity constraint
   applies (i.e. the same unique wavelength MUST be assigned to the LSP
   at each TE link of the segment). If the LSC LSP induced a Forwarding
   Adjacency / TE link, the switching capabilities of the TE link would
   be [X X] where X < LSC (PSC, TDM, ...).

   This document aligns with GMPLS extensions for PCEP [PCEP-GMPLS] for
   generic property such as label, label-set and label assignment
   noting that wavelength is a type of label. Wavelength restrictions
   and constraints are also formulated in terms of labels per [GEN-
   ENCODE].

   The optical modulation properties, which are also referred to as
   signal compatibility, are already considered in signaling in [RWA-
   Encode] and [WSON-OSPF]. In order to improve the signal quality and
   limit some optical effects several advanced modulation processing
   are used. Those modulation properties contribute not only to optical
   signal quality checks but also constrain the selection of sender and
   receiver, as they should have matching signal processing
   capabilities. This document includes signal compatibility
   constraints as part of RWA path computation. That is, the signal
   processing capabilities (e.g., modulation and FEC) must be
   compatible between the sender and the receiver of the optical path
   across all optical elements.

   This document, however, does not address optical impairments as part
   of RWA path computation. See [WSON-Imp] and [RSVP-Imp] for more
   information on optical impairments and GMPLS.

4. Encoding of a RWA Path Request

   Figure 2 shows one typical PCE based implementation, which is
   referred to as the Combined Process (R&WA). With this architecture,
   the two processes of routing and wavelength assignment are accessed
   via a single PCE. This architecture is the base architecture from
   which the requirements have been specified in [PCE-RWA] and the PCEP
   extensions that are going to be specified in this document based on
   this architecture.

4.1. Wavelength Assignment (WA) Object

   Wavelength allocation can be performed by the PCE by different
   means:

   (a) By means of Explicit Label Control, in the sense that one (or
   two) allocated labels MAY appear after an interface route subobject.
   (b) By means of a Label Set, containing one or more allocated Labels,
   provided by the PCE.

   Option (b) allows distributed label allocation (performed during
   signaling) to complete wavelength assignment.

   Additionally, given a range of potential labels to allocate, the
   request SHOULD convey the heuristic / mechanism to the allocation.

   The format of a PCReq message after incorporating the WA object is
   as follows:

   <PCReq Message> ::= <Common Header>

                          [<svec-list>]

   If the WA object is present in the request, it MUST be encoded after
   the ENDPOINTS object.

   The following new flags SHOULD be set

     . M (Mode - 1 bit): M bit is used to indicate the mode of
        wavelength assignment. When M bit is set to 1, this indicates
        that the label assigned by the PCE must be explicit. That is,
        the selected way to convey the allocated wavelength is by means
        of Explicit Label Control (ELC) [RFC4003] for each hop of a
        computed LSP. Otherwise, the label assigned by the PCE needs
        not be explicit (i.e., it can be suggested in the form of label
        set objects in the corresponding response, to allow distributed
        WA. In such case, the PCE MUST return a Label Set object as
        described in Section 2.2 of [Gen-Encode] in the response.

     . O (Order - 3 bits): O bit is used to indicate the wavelength
        assignment constraint in regard to the order of wavelength
        assignment to be returned by the PCE. This case is only applied
        when M bit is set to "explicit." The following indicators
        should be defined:

         000 - Reserved

         001 - Random Assignment

         010 - First Fit (FF) in descending Order

         011 - First Fit (FF) in ascending Order

         100 - Last Fit (LF) in ascending Order

         101 - Last Fit (LF) in descending Order

         110 - Unspecified

         111 - Reserved

4.2. Wavelength Restriction Constraint TLV

   For any request that contains a wavelength assignment, the requester
   (PCC) MUST be able to specify a restriction on the wavelengths to be
   used. This restriction is to be interpreted by the PCE as a
   constraint on the tuning ability of the origination laser
   transmitter or on any other maintenance related constraints. Note
   that if the LSP LSC spans different segments, the PCE MUST have
   mechanisms to know the tunability restrictions of the involved
   wavelength converters / regenerators, e.g. by means of the TED
   either via IGP or NMS. Even if the PCE knows the tunability of the
   transmitter, the PCC MUST be able to apply additional constraints to
   the request.

    The TLV type is TBD, recommended value is TBD. This TLV MAY appear
   more than once to be able to specify multiple restrictions.

   The TLV data is defined as follows:



   <Wavelength Restriction Constraint> ::=

                  <Action> <Count> <Reserved>

4.3. Signal processing capability restrictions

   Path computation for WSON include the check of signal processing
   capabilities, those capability MAY be provided by the IGP, however
   this is not a MUST.  Moreover, a PCC should be able to indicate
   additional restrictions for those signal compatibility, either on
   the endpoint or any given link.

   The supported signal processing capabilities are the one described
   in [RWA-Info]:

      .  Optical Interface Class List

      .  Bit rate

      .  Client signal

   The Bit-rate restriction is already expressed in [PCEP-GMPLS] in the
   GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object.

   The client signal information can be expressed using the REQ-ADAP-
   CAP object from the [PCEP-Layer].

Internet-Draft       PCEP Extension for WSON RWA              July 2013


   In order to support the Optical Interface Class information a new
   TLV is introduced as endpoint-restriction in the END-POINTS type
   Generalized endpoint:

      .  Optical Interface Class List TLV

   The END-POINTS type generalized endpoint is extended as follows:

   <endpoint-restrictions> ::= <LABEL-REQUEST>

                               <Wavelength Restriction Constraint>

                               [<signal-compatibility-restriction>...]



Where

   signal-compatibility-restriction ::=

                    <Optical Interface Class List>

   The encoding for Optical Interface Class List is described in
   Section 5.2 of [RWA-Encode].



        4.3.1. Signal Processing Exclusion XRO Sub-Object

   The PCC/PCE should be able to exclude particular types of signal
   processing along the path in order to handle client restriction or
   multi-domain path computation.

   In order to support the exclusion a new XRO sub-object is defined:
   the signal processing exclusion:

       0                   1                   2                   3

               Figure 5 Signaling Processing XRO Sub-Object

   The Attribute field indicates how the exclusion sub-object is to be
   interpreted. The Attribute can only be 0 (Interface) or 1 (Node).

   The sub-sub objects are encoded as in RSVP signaling definition
   [WSON-Sign].

        4.3.2. IRO sub-object: signal processing inclusion

   Similar to the XRO sub-object the PCC/PCE should be able to include
   particular types of signal processing along the path in order to
   handle client restriction or multi-domain path computation.

   This is supported by adding the sub-object "processing" defined for
   ERO in [WSON-Sign] to the PCEP IRO object.



5. Encoding of a RWA Path Reply

   The ERO is used to encode the path of a TE LSP through the network.
   The ERO is carried within a given path of a PCEP response, which is
   in turn carried in a PCRep message to provide the computed TE LSP if
   the path computation was successful. The preferred way to convey the
   allocated wavelength is by means of Explicit Label Control (ELC)
   [RFC4003].

   In order to encode wavelength assignment, the Wavelength Assignment
   (WA) Object needs to be employed to be able to specify wavelength
   assignment. Since each segment of the computed optical path is
   associated with wavelength assignment, the WA Object should be
   aligned with the ERO object.

   Encoding details will be provided further revisions and will be
   aligned as much as possible with [WSON-Sign] and [LSPA-ERO]


5.1. Error Indicator

   To indicate errors associated with the RWA request, a new Error Type
   (TDB) and subsequent error-values are defined as follows for
   inclusion in the PCEP-ERROR Object:

   A new Error-Type (TDB) and subsequent error-values are defined as
   follows:

Internet-Draft       PCEP Extension for WSON RWA              July 2013


      .  Error-Type=TBD; Error-value=1: if a PCE receives a RWA request
         and the PCE is not capable of processing the request due to
         insufficient memory, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a
         PCEP-ERROR Object (Error-Type=TDB) and an Error-value(Error-
         value=1).  The PCE stops processing the request.  The
         corresponding RWA request MUST be cancelled at the PCC.

      .  Error-Type=TBD; Error-value=2: if a PCE receives a RWA request
         and the PCE is not capable of RWA computation, the PCE MUST
         send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object (Error-Type=TDB)
         and an Error-value (Error-value=2). The PCE stops processing
         the request.  The corresponding RWA computation MUST be
         cancelled at the PCC.




5.2. NO-PATH Indicator


   To communicate the reason(s) for not being able to find RWA for the
   path request, the NO-PATH object can be used in the corresponding
   response.  The format of the NO-PATH object body is defined in
   [RFC5440].  The object may contain a NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV to provide
   additional information about why a path computation has failed.

   One new bit flag are defined to be carried in the Flags field in the
   NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carried in the NO-PATH Object.

      .  Bit TDB: When set, the PCE indicates no feasible route was
         found that meets all the constraints (e.g., wavelength
         restriction, signal compatibility, etc.) associated with RWA.



6. Manageability Considerations

   Manageability of WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) with
   PCE must address the following considerations:

6.1. Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following
   PCEP session parameters on a PCC:



Lee & Casellas          Expires January12,2014                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       PCEP Extension for WSON RWA              July 2013


      .  The ability to send a WSON RWA request.

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following
   PCEP session parameters on a PCE:

      .  The support for WSON RWA.

      .  A set of WSON RWA specific policies (authorized sender,
         request rate limiter, etc).


   These parameters may be configured as default parameters for any
   PCEP session the PCEP speaker participates in, or may apply to a
   specific session with a given PCEP peer or a specific group of
   sessions with a specific group of PCEP peers.


6.2. Information and Data Models, e.g. MIB module

   Extensions to the PCEP MIB module defined in [PCEP-MIB] should be
   defined, so as to cover the WSON RWA information introduced in this
   document. A future revision of this document will list the
   information that should be added to the MIB module.

6.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in section 8.3 of [RFC5440].


6.4. Verifying Correct Operation

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   section 8.4 of [RFC5440]


6.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   The PCE Discovery mechanisms ([RFC5089] and [RFC5088]) may be used
   to advertise WSON RWA path computation capabilities to PCCs.

6.6. Impact on Network Operation

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new network
   operation requirements in addition to those already listed in
   section 8.6 of [RFC5440].



7. Security Considerations

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models
   within PCEP [PCEP]. However the additional information distributed
   in order to address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of
   network capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private.
   Consideration should be given to securing this information.



8. IANA Considerations

   A future revision of this document will present requests to IANA for
   codepoint allocation.

   The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of
   any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be
   claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology
   described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license
   under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it
   represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any
   such rights.

   Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF
   Secretariat and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or
   the result of an attempt made to obtain a general license or
   permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or
   users of this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line
   IPR repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement
   any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please
   address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org.
