  Test Plan and Results for Advancing RFC 2680 on the Standards Track
                 draft-morton-ippm-testplan-rfc2680-01

Abstract

   This memo proposes to advance a performance metric RFC along the
   standards track, specifically RFC 2680 on One-way Loss Metrics.
   Observing that the metric definitions themselves should be the
   primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo
   describes the test procedures to evaluate specific metric requirement
   clauses to determine if the requirement has been interpreted and
   implemented as intended.  Two completely independent implementations
   have been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2680.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   The IETF (IP Performance Metrics working group, IPPM) has considered
   how to advance their metrics along the standards track since 2001.

   A renewed work effort sought to investigate ways in which the
   measurement variability could be reduced and thereby simplify the
   problem of comparison for equivalence.

   There is consensus [I-D.ietf-ippm-metrictest] that the metric
   definitions should be the primary focus of evaluation rather than the
   implementations of metrics, and equivalent results are deemed to be
   evidence that the metric specifications are clear and unambiguous.
   This is the metric specification equivalent of protocol
   interoperability.  The advancement process either produces confidence
   that the metric definitions and supporting material are clearly
   worded and unambiguous, OR, identifies ways in which the metric
   definitions should be revised to achieve clarity.

   The process should also permit identification of options that were
   not implemented, so that they can be removed from the advancing
   specification (this is an aspect more typical of protocol advancement
   along the standards track).

   This memo's purpose is to implement the current approach for
   [RFC2680].

   In particular, this memo documents consensus on the extent of
   tolerable errors when assessing equivalence in the results.  In
   discussions, the IPPM working group agreed that test plan and
   procedures should include the threshold for determining equivalence,
   and this information should be available in advance of cross-
   implementation comparisons.  This memo includes procedures for same-
   implementation comparisons to help set the equivalence threshold.

   Another aspect of the metric RFC advancement process is the
   requirement to document the work and results.  The procedures of
   [RFC2026] are expanded in[RFC5657], including sample implementation
   and interoperability reports.  This memo follows the template in
   [I-D.morton-ippm-advance-metrics] for the report that accompanies the
   protocol action request submitted to the Area Director, including
   description of the test set-up, procedures, results for each
   implementation and conclusions.

1.1.  RFC 2680 Coverage

   This plan, in its first draft version, does not cover all critical
   requirements and sections of [RFC2680].  Material will be added as it



Ciavattone, et al.        Expires July 19, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          Stds Track Tests RFC2680            January 2012


   is "discovered" (not all requirements use requirements language).


2.  A Definition-centric metric advancement process

   The process described in Section 3.5 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-metrictest]
   takes as a first principle that the metric definitions, embodied in
   the text of the RFCs, are the objects that require evaluation and
   possible revision in order to advance to the next step on the
   standards track.

   IF two implementations do not measure an equivalent singleton or
   sample, or produce the an equivalent statistic,

   AND sources of measurement error do not adequately explain the lack
   of agreement,

   THEN the details of each implementation should be audited along with
   the exact definition text, to determine if there is a lack of clarity
   that has caused the implementations to vary in a way that affects the
   correspondence of the results.

   IF there was a lack of clarity or multiple legitimate interpretations
   of the definition text,

   THEN the text should be modified and the resulting memo proposed for
   consensus and advancement along the standards track.

   Finally, all the findings MUST be documented in a report that can
   support advancement on the standards track, similar to those
   described in [RFC5657].  The list of measurement devices used in
   testing satisfies the implementation requirement, while the test
   results provide information on the quality of each specification in
   the metric RFC (the surrogate for feature interoperability).


3.  Test configuration

   One metric implementation used was NetProbe version 5.8.5, (an
   earlier version is used in the WIPM system and deployed world-wide).
   NetProbe uses UDP packets of variable size, and can produce test
   streams with Periodic [RFC3432] or Poisson [RFC2330] sample
   distributions.

   The other metric implementation used was Perfas+ version 3.1,
   developed by Deutsche Telekom.  Perfas+ uses UDP unicast packets of
   variable size (but supports also TCP and multicast).  Test streams
   with periodic, Poisson or uniform sample distributions may be used.

      upper diagram emphasizes the VLAN connectivity and geographical
    location.  The lower diagram shows example flows traveling between
    two measurement implementations (for simplicity, only two flows are

                                 Figure 1

   The testing employs the Layer 2 Tunnel Protocol, version 3 (L2TPv3)
   [RFC3931] tunnel between test sites on the Internet.  The tunnel IP
   and L2TPv3 headers are intended to conceal the test equipment
   addresses and ports from hash functions that would tend to spread

   different test streams across parallel network resources, with likely
   variation in performance as a result.

   At each end of the tunnel, one pair of VLANs encapsulated in the
   tunnel are looped-back so that test traffic is returned to each test
   site.  Thus, test streams traverse the L2TP tunnel twice, but appear
   to be one-way tests from the test equipment point of view.

   The network emulator is a host running Fedora 14 Linux
   [http://fedoraproject.org/] with IP forwarding enabled and the
   "netem" Network emulator as part of the Fedora Kernel 2.6.35.11 [http
   ://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/netem]
   loaded and operating.  Connectivity across the netem/Fedora host was
   accomplished by bridging Ethernet VLAN interfaces together with
   "brctl" commands (e.g., eth1.100 <-> eth2.100).  The netem emulator
   was activated on one interface (eth1) and only operates on test
   streams traveling in one direction.  In some tests, independent netem
   instances operated separately on each VLAN.

   The links between the netem emulator host and router and switch were
   found to be 100baseTx-HD (100Mbps half duplex) as reported by "mii-
   tool"when the testing was complete.  Use of Half Duplex was not
   intended, but probably added a small amount of delay variation that
   could have been avoided in full duplex mode.

   Each individual test was run with common packet rates (1 pps, 10pps)
   Poisson/Periodic distributions, and IP packet sizes of 64, 340, and
   500 Bytes.

   For these tests, a stream of at least 300 packets were sent from
   Source to Destination in each implementation.  Periodic streams (as
   per [RFC3432]) with 1 second spacing were used, except as noted.

   As required in Section 2.8.1 of [RFC2680], packet Type-P must be
   reported.  The packet Type-P for this test was IP-UDP with Best
   Effort DCSP.  These headers were encapsulated according to the L2TPv3
   specifications [RFC3931], and thus may not influence the treatment
   received as the packets traversed the Internet.

   With the L2TPv3 tunnel in use, the metric name for the testing
   configured here (with respect to the IP header exposed to Internet
   processing) is:

   Type-IP-protocol-115-One-way-Packet-Loss-<StreamType>-Stream

   With (Section 3.2.  [RFC2680]) Metric Parameters:

   + Src, the IP address of a host (12.3.167.16 or 193.159.144.8)

Internet-Draft          Stds Track Tests RFC2680            January 2012


   + Dst, the IP address of a host (193.159.144.8 or 12.3.167.16)

   + T0, a time

   + Tf, a time

   + lambda, a rate in reciprocal seconds

   + Thresh, a maximum waiting time in seconds (see Section 2.8.2 of
   [RFC2680]) and (Section 3.8.  [RFC2680])

   Metric Units: A sequence of pairs; the elements of each pair are:

   + T, a time, and

   + L, either a zero or a one

   The values of T in the sequence are monotonic increasing.  Note that
   T would be a valid parameter to the *singleton* Type-P-One-way-
   Packet-Loss, and that L would be a valid value of Type-P-One-way-
   Packet Loss (see Section 2 of [RFC2680]).

   Also, Section 2.8.4 of [RFC2680] recommends that the path SHOULD be
   reported.  In this test set-up, most of the path details will be
   concealed from the implementations by the L2TPv3 tunnels, thus a more
   informative path trace route can be conducted by the routers at each
   location.

   When NetProbe is used in production, a traceroute is conducted in
   parallel with, and at the outset of measurements.

   Perfas+ does not support traceroute.

   It was only possible to conduct the traceroute for the measured path
   on one of the tunnel-head routers (the normal trace facilities of the
   measurement systems are confounded by the L2TPv3 tunnel
   encapsulation).


4.  Error Calibration, RFC 2680

   An implementation is required to report calibration results on clock
   synchronization in Section 2.8.3 of [RFC2680] (also required in
   Section 3.7 of [RFC2680] for sample metrics).

   Also, it is recommended to report the probability that a packet
   successfully arriving at the destination network interface is
   incorrectly designated as lost due to resource exhaustion in Section
   2.8.3 of [RFC2680].

4.1.  Clock Synchronization Calibration

   First, we look at clock synchronization.  Sections 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8
   of [RFC2679] give the detailed formulation of the errors and
   uncertainties for calibration.  In summary, Section 3.7.1 of
   [RFC2679] describes the total time-varying uncertainty as:

   Esynch(t)+ Rsource + Rdest




Ciavattone, et al.        Expires July 19, 2012                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Stds Track Tests RFC2680            January 2012


   where:

   Esynch(t) denotes an upper bound on the magnitude of clock
   synchronization uncertainty.

   Rsource and Rdest denote the resolution of the source clock and the
   destination clock, respectively.

   Further, Section 3.7.2 of [RFC2679] describes the total wire-time
   uncertainty as

   Hsource + Hdest

   referring to the upper bounds on host-time to wire-time for source
   and destination, respectively.

   Section 3.7.3 of [RFC2679] describes a test with small packets over
   an isolated minimal network where the results can be used to estimate
   systematic and random components of the sum of the above errors or
   uncertainties.  In a test with hundreds of singletons, the median is
   the systematic error and when the median is subtracted from all
   singletons, the remaining variability is the random error.

   The test context, or Type-P of the test packets, must also be
   reported, as required in Section 3.8 of [RFC2679] and all metrics
   defined there.  Type-P is defined in Section 13 of [RFC2330] (as are
   many terms used below).

4.1.1.  NetProbe Clock Error

   In general, NetProbe clock error is dependent on the specific version
   and installation details.

   NetProbe operates using host time above the UDP layer, which is
   different from the wire-time preferred in [RFC2330], but can be
   identified as a source of error according to Section 3.7.2 of
   [RFC2679].

   Accuracy of NetProbe measurements is usually limited by NTP
   synchronization performance (which is typically taken as ~+/-1ms
   error or greater), although the installation used in this testing
   often exhibits errors much less than typical for NTP.  The primary
   stratum 1 NTP server is closely located on a sparsely utilized
   network management LAN, thus it avoids many concerns raised in
   Section 10 of[RFC2330] (in fact, smooth adjustment, long-term drift
   analysis and compensation, and infrequent adjustment all lead to
   stability during measurement intervals, the main concern).

   The resolution of the reported results is 1us (us = microsecond) in
   the version of NetProbe tested here, which contributes to at least
   +/-1us error.

   NetProbe implements a time-keeping sanity check on sending and
   receiving time-stamping processes.  When the significant process
   interruption takes place, individual test packets are flagged as
   possibly containing unusual time errors, and are excluded from the
   sample used for all "time" metrics.

   We performed a NetProbe calibration of the type described in Section
   3.7.3 of [RFC2679], using 64 Byte packets over a cross-connect cable.
   The results estimate systematic and random components of the sum of
   the Hsource + Hdest errors or uncertainties.  In a test with 300
   singletons conducted over 30 seconds (periodic sample with 100ms
   spacing), the median is the systematic error and the remaining
   variability is the random error.  One set of results is tabulated
   below:

4.1.2.  Perfas Clock Error

   Perfas+ is configured to use GPS synchronisation and uses NTP
   synchronization as a fall-back or default.  GPS synchronisation
   worked throughout this test with the exception of the calibration
   stated here (one implementation was NTP synchronised only).  The time
   stamp accuracy typically is 0.1 ms.

   The resolution of the results reported by Perfas+ is 1us (us =
   microsecond) in the version tested here, which contributes to at
   least +/-1us error.

4.2.  Packet Loss Determination Error

   Since both measurement implementations have resource limitations, it
   is theoretically possible that these limits could be exceeded and a
   packet that arrived at the destination successfully might be
   discarded in error.

   In previous test efforts [I-D.morton-ippm-advance-metrics], NetProbe
   produced 6 multicast streams with an aggregate bit rate over 53
   Mbit/s, in order to characterize the 1-way capacity of a NISTNet-
   based emulator.  Neither the emulator nor the pair of NetProbe
   implementations used in this testing dropped any packets in these
   streams.

   The maximum load used here between any 2 NetProbe implementations was
   be 11.5 Mbit/s divided equally among 3 unicast test streams.  We
   conclude that steady resource usage does not contribute error
   (additional loss) to the measurements.


5.  Pre-determined Limits on Equivalence

   In this section, we provide the numerical limits on comparisons
   between implementations, in order to declare that the results are
   equivalent and therefore, the tested specification is clear.

   A key point is that the allowable errors, corrections, and confidence
   levels only need to be sufficient to detect mis-interpretation of the
   tested specification resulting in diverging implementations.

   Also, the allowable error must be sufficient to compensate for
   measured path differences.  It was simply not possible to measure
   fully identical paths in the VLAN-loopback test configuration used,
   and this practical compromise must be taken into account.

   For Anderson-Darling K-sample (ADK) comparisons, the required
   confidence factor for the cross-implementation comparisons SHALL be
   the smallest of:

   o  0.95 confidence factor at 1ms resolution, or

   o  the smallest confidence factor (in combination with resolution) of
      the two same-implementation comparisons for the same test
      conditions.

   A constant time accuracy error of as much as +/-0.5ms MAY be removed
   from one implementation's distributions (all singletons) before the
   ADK comparison is conducted.



Ciavattone, et al.        Expires July 19, 2012                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          Stds Track Tests RFC2680            January 2012


   A constant propagation delay error (due to use of different sub-nets
   between the switch and measurement devices at each location) of as
   much as +2ms MAY be removed from one implementation's distributions
   (all singletons) before the ADK comparison is conducted.

   For comparisons involving the mean of a sample or other central
   statistics, the limits on both the time accuracy error and the
   propagation delay error constants given above also apply.


6.  Tests to evaluate RFC 2680 Specifications

   This section describes some results from production network (cross-
   Internet) tests with measurement devices implementing IPPM metrics
   and a network emulator to create relevant conditions, to determine
   whether the metric definitions were interpreted consistently by
   implementors.

   The procedures are similar contained in Appendix A.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metrictest] for One-way Delay.

   Note that there are only five instances of the requirement term
   "MUST" in [RFC2680] outside of the boilerplate and [RFC2119]
   reference.

6.1.  One-way Loss, ADK Sample Comparison - Same & Cross Implementation

   This test determines if implementations produce results that appear
   to come from a common packet loss distribution, as an overall
   evaluation of Section 3 of [RFC2680], "A Definition for Samples of
   One-way Packet Loss".  Same-implementation comparison results help to
   set the threshold of equivalence that will be applied to cross-
   implementation comparisons.

   This test is intended to evaluate measurements in sections 2 and 3 of
   [RFC2680].

   By testing the extent to which the distributions of one-way packet
   loss ratios from two implementations of [RFC2680] appear to be from
   the same distribution, we economize on comparisons, because comparing
   a set of individual summary statistics (as defined in Section 5 (?)
   of [RFC2680]) would require another set of individual evaluations of
   equivalence.  Instead, we can simply check which statistics were
   implemented, and report on those facts.

   1.  Configure an L2TPv3 path between test sites, and each pair of
       measurement devices to operate tests in their designated pair of
       VLANs.



Ciavattone, et al.        Expires July 19, 2012                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          Stds Track Tests RFC2680            January 2012


   2.  Measure a sample of one-way packet loss singletons with 2 or more
       implementations, using identical options and network emulator
       settings (if used).

   3.  Measure a sample of one-way packet loss singletons with *four*
       instances of the *same* implementations, using identical options,
       noting that connectivity differences SHOULD be the same as for
       the cross implementation testing.

   4.  Apply the ADK comparison procedures (see Appendix C of
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-metrictest]) and determine the resolution and
       confidence factor for distribution equivalence of each same-
       implementation comparison and each cross-implementation
       comparison.

   5.  Take the coarsest resolution and confidence factor for
       distribution equivalence from the same-implementation pairs, or
       the limit defined in Section 5 above, as a limit on the
       equivalence threshold for these experimental conditions.

   6.  Apply constant correction factors to all singletons of the sample
       distributions, as described and limited in Section 5 above.

   7.  Compare the cross-implementation ADK performance with the
       equivalence threshold determined in step 5 to determine if
       equivalence can be declared.

   The common parameters used for tests in this section are:

   o  IP header + payload = 64 octets

   o  Periodic sampling at 1 packet per second

   o  Test duration = 300 seconds (March 29)

   The netem emulator was set for 100ms average delay, with uniform
   delay variation of +/-50ms.  In this experiment, the netem emulator
   was configured to operate independently on each VLAN and thus the
   emulator itself is a potential source of error when comparing streams
   that traverse the test path in different directions.

   In the result analysis of this section:

   o  All comparisons used 1 microsecond resolution.

   o  No Correction Factors were applied.

   o  The 0.95 confidence factor (1.960 for paired stream comparison)
      was used.

6.1.1.  NetProbe Same-implementation results

   A single same-implementation comparison

6.1.2.  Perfas Same-implementation results

   All pair comparisons pass the ADK criterion.

6.1.3.  One-way Packet Loss, Cross-Implementation ADK Comparison

   The cross-implementation results are compared using a combined ADK
   analysis [ref], where all NetProbe results are compared with all
   Perfas results after testing that the combined same-implementation
   results pass the ADK criterion.

6.1.4.  Conclusions on the ADK Results for One-way Packet Loss

   Similar testing was repeated many times ...

   We conclude that the two implementations are capable of producing
   equivalent one-way packet loss distributions based on their
   interpretation of [RFC2680] .

6.2.  One-way Loss, Delay threshold

   This test determines if implementations use the same configured
   maximum waiting time delay from one measurement to another under
   different delay conditions, and correctly declare packets arriving in
   excess of the waiting time threshold as lost.

   See Section 2.8.2 of [RFC2680].

   1.  configure an L2TPv3 path between test sites, and each pair of
       measurement devices to operate tests in their designated pair of
       VLANs.

   2.  configure the network emulator to add 1.0 sec one-way constant
       delay in one direction of transmission.

   3.  measure (average) one-way delay with 2 or more implementations,
       using identical waiting time thresholds (Thresh) for loss set at
       3 seconds.

   4.  configure the network emulator to add 3 sec one-way constant
       delay in one direction of transmission equivalent to 2 seconds of



Ciavattone, et al.        Expires July 19, 2012                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          Stds Track Tests RFC2680            January 2012


       additional one-way delay (or change the path delay while test is
       in progress, when there are sufficient packets at the first delay
       setting)

   5.  repeat/continue measurements

   6.  observe that the increase measured in step 5 caused all packets
       with 2 sec additional delay to be declared lost, and that all
       packets that arrive successfully in step 3 are assigned a valid
       one-way delay.

   The common parameters used for tests in this section are:

   o  IP header + payload = 64 octets

   o  Poisson sampling at lambda = 1 packet per second

   o  Test duration = 900 seconds total (March 21)

   The netem emulator was set to add constant delays as specified in the
   procedure above.

6.2.1.  NetProbe results for Loss Threshold

   In NetProbe, the Loss Threshold is implemented uniformly over all
   packets as a post-processing routine.  With the Loss Threshold set at
   3 seconds, all packets with one-way delay >3 seconds are marked
   "Lost" and included in the Lost Packet list with their transmission
   time (as required in Section 3.3 of [RFC2680]).  This resulted in 342
   packets designated as lost in one of the test streams (with average
   delay = 3.091 sec).

6.2.2.  Perfas Results for Loss Threshold

   Perfas uses a fixed Loss Threshold which was not adjustable during
   this study.  The Loss Threshold is approximately one minute, and
   emulation of a delay of this size was not attempted.  However, it is
   possible to implement any delay threshold desired with a post-
   processing routine and subsequent analysis.  Using this method, 195
   packets would be declared lost (with average delay = 3.091 sec).

6.2.3.  Conclusions for Loss Threshold

   Both implementations assume that any constant delay value desired can
   be used as the Loss Threshold, since all delays are stored as a pair
   <Time, Delay> as required in [RFC2680].  This is a simple way to
   enforce the constant loss threshold envisioned in [RFC2680] (see
   specific section reference above).  We take the position that the



Ciavattone, et al.        Expires July 19, 2012                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          Stds Track Tests RFC2680            January 2012


   assumption of post-processing is compliant, and that the text of the
   RFC should be revised slightly to include this point.

6.3.  One-way Loss with Out-of-Order Arrival

   Section 3.6 of [RFC2680] indicates that implementations need to
   ensure that reordered packets are handled correctly using an
   uncapitalized "must".  In essence, this is an implied requirement
   because the correct packet must be identified as lost if it fails to
   arrive before its delay threshold under all circumstances, and
   reordering is always a possibility on IP network paths.

6.4.  Poisson Sending Process Evaluation

   Section 3.7 of [RFC2680] indicates that implementations need to
   ensure that their sending process is reasonably close to a classic
   Poisson distribution when used.

6.5.  Implementation of Statistics for One-way Delay

   We check which statistics were implemented, and report on those
   facts, noting that Section 4 of [RFC2680] does not specify the
   calculations exactly, and gives only some illustrative examples.

   live networks are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and
