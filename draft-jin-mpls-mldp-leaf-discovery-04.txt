               draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery-04.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for a root node to discover the
   leaf nodes of an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  Such kind of function
   could be used for multiplexing/aggregating root initiated and leaf
   initiated application which will use mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.
   Examples of root initiated applications are P2MP PW
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw], VPLS multicast [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast],
   L3VPN multicast [RFC6513].  And examples of leaf initiated
   applications are statically configured mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP,
   mLDP in-band signaling [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling].

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery           May 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a mechanism for a root node to discover the
   leaf nodes of an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  Such kind of function
   could be used for multiplexing/aggregating root initiated and leaf
   initiated application which will use mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.
   Examples of root initiated applications are P2MP PW
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw], VPLS multicast [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast],
   L3VPN multicast [RFC6513].  And examples of leaf initiated
   applications are statically configured mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP,
   mLDP in-band signaling [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling].

   This draft provides a discovery mechanism based on a signaling
   session between each leaf and root node.  Each leaf node would signal
   the leaf node information to root node through this session.  There
   are two signaling protocols to be used for root initiated
   application, targeted LDP [RFC5036] or BGP auto-discovery using BGP
   Multiprotocol Extensions [RFC4760].  In order to reuse the signaling
   protocol of root initiated application, this document introduces both
   signaling protocols for mLDP leaf discovery.


2.  Motivation and problem statement

   The leaf initiated application mLDP in-band signaled P2MP LSP will
   trigger the leaf node to join from leaf node, which means none of the
   members belonging to a P2MP/MP2MP LSP topology knows all the other
   members of the P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  This means that the root node cannot
   get the whole P2MP/MP2MP LSP membership information.  This problem
   may cause some limitation for multiplexing/aggregation root initiated
   applications using mLDP LSPs.

   Multicast VPLS [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast] is a root initiated
   application.  When setting up a inclusive P-Multicast tunnel, BGP A-D
   is used to do the VPLS membership auto-discovery.  The mLDP based
   P2MP/MP2MP LSP will be set up when receiving auto-discovery routes
   through BGP A-D.  The root node will only know the mLDP LSP leaf node
   information which is triggered by the specific BGP A-D mechanism.
   Let's assume that a mLDP in-band signaling P2MP/MP2MP LSP_a (setup by
   leaf initiated application) already exist on the root node, and that
   LSP_a has the same leaf nodes as the P2MP LSP that VPLS multicast BGP
   A-D tries to set up.  The root node does not know LSP_a leaf node
   information, and will set up mLDP based LSP_b triggered by BGP A-D
   with same root and leaf nodes.

   This causes mLDP based LSP resources waste in the network as it may
   not be necessary to setup two mLDP LSPs with the same root and leaves
   in the same network.

   The introduction of a leaf discovery mechanism for mLDP based P2MP/
   MP2MP LSP will enable leaf initiated applications to share one P2MP/
   MP2MP LSP with root initiated application of P2MP/MP2MP LSP by
   multiplexing/aggregating mechanism.


3.  Terminology

   mLDP: Multicast LDP.

   T-LDP: Target LDP.

   P2MP LSP: An LSP that has one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress
   LSRs.

   MP2MP LSP: An LSP that connects a set of nodes, such that traffic
   sent by any node in the LSP is delivered to all others.

   Bud LSR: An LSR that is an egress but also has one or more directly
   connected downstream LSRs.

   Ingress LSR: Source of the P2MP LSP, also referred to as root node.

   Egress LSR: One of potentially many destinations of an LSP, also
   referred to as leaf node in the case of P2MP and MP2MP LSPs.

   Transit LSR: An LSR that has one or more directly connected
   downstream LSRs.

   Leaf node: A Leaf node can be either an Egress or Bud LSR when
   referred in the context of a P2MP LSP.  In the context of a MP2MP
   LSP, an LSR is both Ingress and Egress for the same MP2MP LSP and can
   also be a Bud LSR.

   P2MP FEC: The P2MP FEC Element consists of the address of the root of
   the P2MP LSP and an opaque value.

   MP2MP FEC: MP2MP FEC consists of MP2MP downstream FEC and upstream
   FEC Element.

   MP FEC: Includes both P2MP FEC and MP2MP FEC.


4.  Leaf discovery mechanism

   It would be beneficial if the mLDP leaf discovery mechanism can reuse
   the same signaling session as the root initiated application, without
   requiring additional session overload.  This document defines two

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery           May 2012


   leaf discovery mechanisms, one is based on T-LDP, the other is based
   on MP-BGP.  Generally, the root initiated application with LDP as the
   main signaling mechanism, e.g, P2MP PW [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw], would
   use leaf discovery mechanism based on T-LDP, while application with
   MP-BGP as main signaling mechanism, e.g, VPLS
   Multicast[I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast], L3VPN Multicast [RFC6513] may
   use leaf discovery mechanism based on MP-BGP.

4.1.  Leaf discovery mechanism based on T-LDP

   This section will introduce the discovery mechanism based on T-LDP
   session.  Each leaf node will report the leaf node information to
   root through this T-LDP session.  It is required that there is a
   T-LDP session existed between each leaf node and root node. mLDP leaf
   discovery function will share the same mLDP P2MP capability described
   in section 2.1 of [RFC6388]

   A LDP Label mapping message on the T-LDP session to the root with the
   MP FEC Element is used to convey the addition of the leaf membership
   to the root.  The implicit NULL label is used to indicate that the
   mapping is from a leaf node.  The Label Withdraw message is used to
   convey the deletion of the leaf membership to the root.

4.1.1.  Node operation

   The mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP leaf discovery mechanism can be
   operated as follows.

   For every leaf node, there will be a T-LDP session to be setup
   between root and leaf node.  This T-LDP session can be setup
   automatically or manually, which depends on specific implementation.

   When the leaf node is triggered to join one P2MP/MP2MP LSP, by
   various applications, the leaf node sends label mapping message to
   its upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends LDP label map message with MP FEC to its root node.  When
   the root node receives the LDP label map message over T-LDP session
   with MP FEC, it will store the leaf node information associated with
   the specified P2MP/MP2MP LSP locally.

   When the leaf node is triggered to leave one P2MP/MP2MP LSP, by
   various applications, the leaf node sends label withdraw message to
   its upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends LDP label withdraw message with MP FEC to its root node.
   When the root node receives the LDP label withdraw message over T-LDP
   with MP FEC, it will delete the leaf node information associated with
   the specified P2MP/MP2MP LSP locally.

4.2.  Leaf discovery mechanism based on MP-BGP

   This section will introduce the discovery mechanism based on MP-
   BGP[RFC4760].  Each leaf node will report the leaf node information
   to root through this BGP session.

4.2.1.  mLDP leaf NLRI

   This document defines a new BGP NLRI, called mLDP leaf NLRI.
   Following is the format of the mLDP leaf NLRI:


                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |   mLDP MP FEC Element Length (1 octet)    |
                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |      mLDP MP FEC Element (Variable)       |
                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |    Leaf Node Address Length (1 octet)     |
                   +-------------------------------------------+
                   |        Leaf Node Address (Variable)       |
                   +-------------------------------------------+

                                 Figure 1

   mLDP MP FEC Element may either contain P2MP FEC or MP2MP FEC element.
   Leaf Node Address field contains the leaf node IP address, and the
   value of length is 32 if it is IPv4 address, or 128 if it is IPv6
   address.  The NLRI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI is
   a mLDP MP FEC Element attached with Leaf Node Address.  The mLDP leaf
   NLRI is advertised in BGP UPDATE messages using the MP_REACH_NLRI and
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes [RFC4760].  The [AFI, SAFI] value pair
   used to identify this NLRI is (AFI=26(AFI for MPLS Multicast,
   pending, IANA allocation), SAFI=8(SAFI for mLDP leaf discovery,
   pending IANA allocation)).

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange mLDP leaf NLRI, they must
   use BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure that they both are
   capable of properly processing such NLRI.  This is done as specified
   in [RFC4760], by using capability code 1 (multiprotocol BGP) with an
   AFI of 26 and an SAFI of mLDP leaf discovery.

   The Next Hop field of MP_REACH_NLRI attribute shall be interpreted as
   an IPv4 address, whenever the length of the NextHop address is 4
   octets, and as a IPv6 address, whenever the length of the NextHop
   address is 16 octets.

4.2.2.  Node operation

   The mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP leaf discovery mechanism can be
   operated as follows.

   When the leaf node is triggered to join one P2MP/MP2MP LSP, by
   various applications, the leaf node sends label mapping message to
   its upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends BGP UPDATE messages with MP_REACH_NLRI to its root node.
   The mLDP leaf NLRI will set Leaf Node Address to leaf node IP
   address, and next hop field to leaf node identifier.  When the root
   node receives BGP UPDATE messages with MP_REACH_NLRI, it will store
   the leaf node information associated with the specified P2MP/MP2MP
   LSP locally.

   When the leaf node is triggered to leave one P2MP/MP2MP LSP, by
   various applications, the leaf node sends label withdraw message to
   its upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends BGP UPDATE messages with MP_UNREACH_NLRI to its root node.
   The mLDP leaf NLRI will set Leaf Node Address to leaf node IP
   address, and next hop field to leaf node identifier.  When the root
   node receives BGP UPDATE messages with MP_UNREACH_NLRI, it will
   delete the leaf node information associated with the specified P2MP/
   MP2MP LSP locally.

   To constrain distribution of the mLDP leaf NLRI to the AS of the
   advertising PE the BGP Update message originated by the advertising
   PE SHOULD carry the NO_EXPORT Community [RFC1997].


5.  Scalability

   As recommended in section 4, leaf discovery will reuse the same
   signaling session as application, and will not setup additional
   sessions.  For the application that uses T-LDP to do leaf discovery,
   all the leaf nodes have to setup T-LDP session to root node.  There
   may be too many T-LDP sessions that have to be setup on the root node
   in the network, which will cause some scalability problem.  This
   problem is caused by the application and out of scope of this draft.


6.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for the multicast LDP
   specification, as described in [I-D. draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp], and
   MP-BGP, as described in [RFC4760].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  MP-BGP

   This document requires allocation of a new BGP AFI and SAFI.

   A new AFI is allocated for MPLS Multicast function, the requested
   value has been pre-allocated as 26.

   A new BGP SAFI for "Network Layer Reachability Information used for
   mLDP leaf discovery" from the IANA "Subsequence Address Family
   Identifiers (SAFI)" registry.  The requested value has been pre-
   allocated as 8.
