                         DHCPv6 through Tunnels
                  draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-tunnel-00.txt

Abstract

   The host configuration protocol DHCPv6 [RFC3315] relies on link-local
   addressing and multicast to function.  However, most of the existing
   6over4 tunnel link types (e.g., 6rd [RFC5969] ) don't support IPv6
   link-local addresses and even IPv6 multicast addresses.  Taking 6rd
   as an example, this document specifies how DHCPv6 can be used across
   such tunnel links .

1.  Introduction

   As specified in the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315], "...The client
   MUST use a link-local address assigned to the interface for which it
   is requesting configuration information as the source address in the
   header of the IP datagram." and "...Unless otherwise specified in
   this document, or in a document that describes how IPv6 is carried
   over a specific type of link (for link types that do not support
   multicast), a client sends DHCP messages to the
   All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers".

   However, link-local addresses and even multicast addresses are not
   supported over most of the existing 6over4 tunnel link types. 6rd as
   described in [RFC5969] is a real example.

   Taking 6rd as an example, this document describes how DHCPv6 service
   can be provided across such tunnel links .


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  DHCPv6 over 6rd links

   There are two problems to be solved with regards to providing DHCPv6
   service over a 6rd link:
   o  A DHCPv6 client uses an IPv6 link-local address as the source
      address when requesting configuration information [RFC3315].
      Link-local addressing is not supported on an 6rd link.
   o  A DHCPv6 client sends a request to the
      All_DHCP_Relay_Agent_and_Servers multicast address. 6rd as
      specified in [RFC5969] does not support IPv6 multicast.

   The first problem can be solved by changing the DHCPv6 protocol to
   allow for a global address to be used as the source address in

   requests.  Another solution that does not require protocol changes,
   is to send DHCPv6 requests via a local DHCPv6 relay on the 6rd CE.

   The 6rd CE MUST support a local DHCPv6 client and relay.  The DHCPv6
   client running on the 6rd CE's virtual tunnel interface MUST send
   DHCPv6 messages through a local DHCPv6 relay that encapsulates the
   client message and forwards it to a DHCPv6 server or relay using one
   of the 6rd CE's global unicast addresses as the source address.

   The 6rd CE DHCPv6 relay agent SHOULD use the 6rd BR IPv6 anycast
   address as the destination address, section 20 of [RFC3315].  If the
   6rd link supports multicast [I-D.ietf-mboned-auto-multicast] the 6rd
   CE DHCPv6 relay MAY use the All_DHCP_Servers [RFC3315] as the
   destination address of Relay-forward messages.

   The 6rd BRs in the 6rd domain must be configured as DHCPv6 relays or
   servers on their 6rd virtual interfaces.

   The 6rd CE SHOULD behave according to
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router].  In particular it operates a DHCPv6
   client on the WAN side (6rd virtual) interface and as a DHCPv6 server
   on the LAN-side interface(s).
