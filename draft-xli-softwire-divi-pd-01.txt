  dIVI-pd: Dual-Stateless IPv4/IPv6 Translation with Prefix Delegation
                     draft-xli-softwire-divi-pd-01

Abstract

   This document presents the address specifications and deployment
   considerations of address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6
   translation with prefix delegation (dIVI-pd).  The dIVI-pd keeps the
   features of stateless, end-to-end address transparency and
   bidirectional-initiated communications of the original stateless
   IPv4/IPv6 translation, while it can utilize the IPv4 addresses more
   effectively.  In addition, it does not require the DNS64 and ALG, and
   can be used with prefix delegation.

1.  Introduction

   The experiences for the IPv6 deployment in the past 10 years strongly
   indicate that for a successful transition, the communication between
   IPv4 and IPv6 address families should be supported.

   Recently, the stateless and stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation methods
   are developed and became the IETF standards.  The original stateless
   IPv4/IPv6 translation (stateless 1:1 IVI) is scalable, maintains the
   end-to-end address transparency and support both IPv6 initiated and
   IPv4 initiated communications [RFC6052], [RFC6144], [RFC6145],
   [RFC6147], [RFC6219].  But it can not use the IPv4 addresses
   effectively.  The stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation can share the IPv4
   addresses among IPv6 hosts, but it only supports IPv6 initiated
   communication [RFC6052], [RFC6144], [RFC6145], [RFC6146], [RFC6147].
   In addition, both stateless and stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation
   technologies require the application layer gateway (ALG) for the
   applications which embed IP address literals.  Furthermore, in ADSL
   and 3G environment, it requires the prefix delegation (assigning an
   IPv6 /64 or shorter) to the customer router/L3-device rather than
   assigning a single IPv4-translatable address to the customer device
   defined in [RFC6052].

   In this document, we present address specifications and deployment
   considerations for address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6
   translation with prefix delegation (dIVI-pd), which is based on basic
   dIVI model [I-D.xli-behave-divi] with the support of prefix
   delegation.  The dIVI-pd can solve the IPv4 address sharing, the ALG
   and prefix delegation problems mentioned above, though still keeps
   the stateless, end-to-end address transparency and supporting of both
   IPv6 initiated and IPv4 initiated communications.

   Due to the introduction of the second translation and the prefix
   delegation, the dIVI-PD is 4-6-4 model and there is a strong
   correlation to the stateless encapsulation approach
   [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd].  This document uses the address format,
   the port mapping algorithm and DHCP options defined in
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option], which are the joint design works
   of stateless encapsulation and dual stateless translation.


2.  Applicability

   The address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with prefix
   delegation (dIVI-pd) can be used in ADSL or 3G environment when
   prefix delegation is required.  An ADSL example is shown in the
   following figure.

   Where the ISP's backbone network is dual stack, as well as part of
   the metro-area network.  The core IPv4/IPv6 translator (XLAT1) is
   performing the IPv4 address-sharing stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation
   and connects the dual-stack part and the IPv6-only part of the metro-
   area networks.  The access network is IPv6-only and multiple IPv4/
   IPv6 translators (XLAT2.x) are connected to the access network and
   provide dual-stack access to the customer devices.  Each dual-stack
   customer get a whole IPv6 /64 (or shorter) and a fractional public
   IPv4 address.

   The data path of this user case are: The IPv6 packets from customer
   devices and the IPv6 Internet are not translated, while the IPv4
   packets from customer devices and the IPv4 Internet are translated
   twice via stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation technology.  Due to the
   stateless nature, the dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation is almost
   equivalent to tunneling with header compression.

   There are two address assignment processes: (1) From BRAS to CPE is
   via IPv6CP and DHCPv6 prefix delegation; (2) From CPE to customer
   device, the IPv6 is via SLAAC and the IPv4 is via DHCP.  Note that if
   more than one customer device requires IPv4 addresses, a built-in
   NAT44 in each CPE can be used to translate a fractional IPv4 address

3.  Terminologies

   This document uses the terminologies defined in
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].

   This document uses the terminologies defined in [RFC6144].

   Since [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port] is used for both
   encapsulation and stateless translation, the equivallent
   terminologies in [RFC6144] are:

   MAP Border Relay (BR) Address:  The MAP Border Relay (BR) Address is
      the IPv4-converted address defined in [RFC6144] and in [RFC6052].

   MAP Customer Edge (CE) Address:  The MAP Customer Edge (CE) Address
      is the IPv4-translatable address defined in [RFC6144] and in
      [RFC6052].

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  Port Mapping Algorithm and Address Format

   The port mapping algorithm and address format are defined in
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].

4.1.  Port Mapping Algorithm

   Port mapping algorithm is defined in Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].

   For given sharing ratio (R) and the maximum number of continue ports
   (M), the generalized modulus algorithm is defined as

   1.  The port number (P) of a given PSID (K) is composed of

       P = R*M*j + M*K + i

       Where
       o PSID: K=0 to R-1
       o Port range index: j = (1024/M)/R to ((65536/M)/R)-1, if the
       well-known port numbers (0-1023) are excluded.
       o Port continue index: i=0 to M-1

   2.  The PSID (K) of a given port number (P) is determined by

       K = (floor(P/M)) % R

       Where
       o % is modular operator
       o floor(arg) is a function returns the largest integer not
       greater than arg

4.2.  Basic Mapping Rule (BMR)

   Basic mapping rule is used for IPv4 prefix, address or port set
   assignment.

   The Embedded Address bits (EA bits) are unique per end user within a
   Domain IPv6 prefix.  The EA bits encode the CE specific IPv4 address
   and port information.  The EA bits can contain a full or part of an
   IPv4 prefix or address, and in the shared IPv4 address case contains
   a Port Set Identifier (PSID).

   Forwarding Mapping Rule (FMR) is used for forwarding, whcih has
   similar address format to BMR.  Specifying forwarding mapping rule
   determines the prefix of the IPv4-translatable addresses for other
   CEs, which results in different routing behaviors (Hubs and Spokes or
   Mesh).

4.3.  Default Mapping Rule (DMR)

   The Defualt mapping rule defines an IPv6 prefix (BR's IPv6 prefix).
   The full destination IPv4 address must be encoded in the IPv6
   address.

4.4.  Address Specifications

   Based on the above discussion, the addresses are defined in the
   following figure.

   [RFC6145].

   Special MTU and fragmentation actions must be taken in the case of
   dual translation.

6.  Dual Stateless Translation

   When dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation is deployed, its behavior
   is similar to tunneling.  Tunneling do not require DNS64 and ALG.,
   because the communication occurs in same address family.  Dual
   translation don't need DNS64 and ALG as well, even in each translator
   the communication occurs between different address families.
   However, there are following differences:

   o  Scalability.  Dual stateless translation is based on routing,
      there is nothing needed to maintain in the translator, operator's
      management loads are minimum compared with tunneling scheme, which
      has to maintain tunnel states.

   o  Low OPEX.  Dual stateless translation can do traffic engineering
      and flow analysis without decapsulation which is a must in tunnel
      case.

   o  Header Compression.  The dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation does
      not need to do encapsulation and 12 octets header overhead are
      reduced.

   o  Transparent transition to IPv6.  The dual stateless translation
      can be treated as a special case of single stateless translation,
      the first XLAT performances exactly the same function, no matter
      there is a XLAT.x or not.  Hence it is a unified approach, rather
      than special setup for the coexistence and transition.  This is to
      say that the ISP can deploy IPv6-only network with XLAT, so the
      IPv6-only hosts can communicate with both the IPv6 Internet and
      the IPv4 Internet.  However, if for some reason a specific ALG
      cannot be supported, and for users, who need that specific
      application, can deploy XLAT.x.  When the application is updated,
      the XLAT.x can be removed.  There is nothing to change to XLAT.
      with more and more contents and users move to IPv6, the working
      load of XLAT will be less and less, and eventually can be removed.
      The whole process is transparent, smooth and incremental.

   Due to the differences between the IPv4 header and the IPv6 header,
   the dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation cannot be entirely lossless
   [RFC6145], for example the IPv4 options are lost.  The experimental
   data shows that the IPv4 packets which contain options are very few
   (10e-6) and causes no harm.  Another corner case is the fragmetation
   handling.  For IPv4 packets with DF=1 and MF=1, the dual stateless
   translation will results in DF=0.  The experimental data shows that
   the IPv4 packets with DF=1 and MF=1 are very few (10e-5) and causes
   no harm.

   IPv4 to IPv6) and decapsulation (from IPv6 to IPv4) defined by
   [RFC2473] can be implemented in the translators.  In this case, the
   dual stateless translation processes are entirely lossless, it still
   has the operation and management conveniences of the dual stateless
   translation in layer 3, but the control in layer 4 is lost.


7.  Deployment Considerations

   Given:

   1.  The total number of CEs in this domain.

   2.  The sharing ratio R.

   3.  The port continue parameter M.

   4.  The customer prefix length.

   5.  The ISP's IPv6 prefix.

   6.  The ISP's IPv4 prefix.

   7.  The BR IPv6 prefix.

   Other dIVI-PD configuration parameters can be derived using the port
   mapping algorithm and address format defined in this document.


8.  CE Configuration via DHCP Option

   Based on the address format and the port mapping algorithm defined in
   this document, the CE needs to get the corresponding parameters via
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315][RFC3633] or others signaling scheme.  These
   parameters are:

   1.  The IPv6 prefix

   2.  The IPv6 prefix length

   3.  The IPv4 prefix

   4.  The IPv4 prefix length

   5.  The sharing ratio (R)

   6.  The maximum number of continue ports (M)

9.  Experimental Evaluation

   The basic stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation (IVI) has been deployed
   since 2007.  It connects [CERNET] and [CNGI-CERNET2].

   The dual stateless translation with IPv4 address sharing (dIVI) has
   been deployed in [CERNET] and [CNGI-CERNET2] since 2009.  The design
   and implementation results are presented in [I-D.xli-behave-divi].

   The dIVI has also been tested in China Telecom.  The
   [I-D.sunq-v6ops-ivi-sp] summarizes the testing results.

   The dIVI-pd presented in this document has been running in [CERNET]
   and [CNGI-CERNET2] since Jan. 2011.  The experimental results
   indicate that the CPE index coding, the suffix coding and port-set ID
   mapping algorithm work for existing applications without any problem.


10.  Security Considerations

   See security considerations presented in [RFC6052] and [RFC6145].


11.  IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.
