               draft-tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-prpolicies-00.txt

Abstract

   This document defines policies for the Partial Reliability Extension
   of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (PR-SCTP) allowing to
   limit the number of retransmissions or to prioritize user messages
   for more efficient send buffer usage.

Internet-Draft         Additional PR-SCTP Policies         February 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   The SCTP Partial Reliability Extension (PR-SCTP) defined in [RFC3758]
   provides a generic method for senders to abandon user messages.  The
   decision to abandon a user message is sender side only and the exact
   condition is called a PR-SCTP policy.  [RFC3758] also defines one
   particular PR-SCTP policy, called Timed Reliability.  This allows the
   sender to specify a timeout for a user message after which the SCTP
   stack abandons the user message.

   This document specified two additional PR-SCTP policies:

   Limited Retransmission Policy:  Allowing to limit the number of
      retransmissions.

   Priority Policy:  Allowing to discard lower priority messages if
      space for higher priority messages is needed in the send buffer.

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Additional PR-SCTP Policies

2.1.  Limited Retransmissions Policy

   Using the Limited Retransmission Policy allows the sender of a user
   message to specify an upper limit for the number retransmissions for
   each DATA chunk of the given user messages.  The sender MUST abandon
   a user message if the number of retransmission of any of the DATA
   chunks of the user message would exceed the provided limit.  Please
   note that the number of retransmissions includes the fast and the
   timer based retransmissions.

   Limiting the number of retransmissions to 0 is allowed.  This
   provides a service similar to UDP, which also doesn't do any
   retransmissions.

   The Limited Retransmissions Policy is used for data channels in the
   RTCWeb protocol stack.  See [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel] for more
   information.

2.2.  Priority Policy

   Using the Priority Policy allows the sender of a user message to
   specify a priority.  When storing a user message in the send buffer
   and there is not enough available space, the SCTP stack MAY abandon
   other user messages with a priority lower than the provided one.

   This allows to transfer message with high priority without blocking
   the send() call, if it is acceptable to abandon lower priority
   messages.

   The Priority Policy can be used in the IPFIX protocol stack.  See
   [RFC5101] for more information.


3.  Socket API Considerations

   This section describes how the socket API defined in [RFC6458] is
   extended to support the newly defined PR-SCTP policies.

   Please note that this section is informational only.

   As specified in [RFC6458], the PR-SCTP policy is configured by using
   the following sctp_prinfo structure:

   struct sctp_prinfo {
     uint16_t pr_policy;
     uint32_t pr_value;
   };

   When the Limited Retransmission Policy described in Section 2.1 is
   used, pr_policy has the value SCTP_PR_SCTP_RTX and the number of
   retransmissions is given in pr_value.

   For using the Priority Policy described in Section 2.2, pr_policy has
   the value SCTP_PR_SCTP_PRIO.  The priority is given in pr_value.  The
   value of zero is the highest priority and larger numbers in pr_value
   denote lower priorities.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions from IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add any additional security considerations in

   addition to the ones given in [RFC4960], [RFC3758], and [RFC6458].
