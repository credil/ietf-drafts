      <t>IPv6 facilitates network routing over an incredibly vast address space, but abuse
        mitigation resolving to underlying structures of routes or blocks of prefixes would be
        highly disruptive due to collateral effects. Use of domains minimizes unintended
        coincidental blocking while offering the consolidation necessary to facilitate connection
        management. Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be identified by an
        authenticated domain.</t>
      <t>DKIM is independent of intended recipients and domains accountable for having sent email.
        SPF normally requires several text based responses imposing high overhead to query various
        locations. These locations can be constructed by email-address local-part macros which can
        flood caches or leverage DNS name compression to further increase network DDoS
        amplifications when receivers' attempt to verify message sources which may then only offer
        authorization, not authentication of accountable domains. Most email abuse, including what
        might be imposed by SPF, is prevented with comprehensive mapping of the address space, but
        such mapping is impractical with IPv6.</t>
      <t>An effective authenticated domain name alternative is needed to provide a basis for
        assessing and reacting to abusive behavior. For most high scale protocols, this involves
        cryptography. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There are currently 18,209,211,661,910,032 /64 equivalent IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"/>
        prefixes routed. <xref target="v6-BGP-Rpts"/>. In comparison, for IPv4 there are
        2,614,711,792 IP addresses routed. While IPv4 is reaching its maximum, IPv6 has about 0.1%
        of the available /64 prefix routed and continues to grow rapidly. Unlike IPv4, there is no
        practical means to scan reverse DNS namespace within IPv6 since each /64 prefix may contain
        any number of PTR records ranging up to 184,000,000,000,000,000,000.</t>
      <t>A technique commonly employed to automate IPv4 address categorization of suitable hosts is
        to check whether reverse PTR records appear to represent valid hostnames. Those that
        represent 4 decimal numbers are often considered unacceptable, for example. Our processing
        of reverse DNS namespace in cooperation with network providers now exclude about 38%, or
        about 1,000,000,000 IPv4 addresses. Comparing IPv6 /64 prefixes with the remainder of
        rout-able IPv4 addresses shows there are 11.3 million times more IPv6 /64 prefixes needing
        categorization that also happen to lack a practical means for facilitating this effort.</t>
      <t>Management of either a list of names or a list of numbers involves logging the associated
        connections for subsequent review. Often limits are imposed over some period to constrain
        overall log growth when establishing behavior. When based on currently routed IPv6 /64
        prefixes, storing just a single bit per rout-able prefix requires 6 million billion bytes or
        5,650 Terra-bytes of storage just to track simple use. Storage requirements for simple
        address use is likely to grow another seven fold as more providers adopt IPv6.
        Categorization of this use will require additional bits to retain counts and indexes further
        multiplying storage needs.</t>
      <t>Some suggest there will not be a significant increase in the number of servers running over
        IPv6 and since the overall number should be comparable, email should be dealing with a
        similar number of IP addresses. Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not constrain the number of IP
        addresses assigned to a network interface. This feature allows each connection from a server
        to originate from a different IP address over the life of its operation while also having an
        ability to effortlessly change /64 prefixes. The increase may prove explosive.</t>
      <t>Extending IP address reputation to IPv6 would also indicate which mailboxes are used to
        detect abuse and afford malefactors a means to wash mailing lists to sidestep enforcement of
        subscription policies. Detection of unsolicited commercial email is a fundamental element in
        email reputation. Traditional address reputation techniques with IPv6 will not retain
        effective detection. Even if detection were practical, no scheme can distribute highly
        sparse IP address information quickly enough to counter an IPv6 source's agility at evading
        IP address based mitigation.</t>
      <t>Checking reverse DNS entries per SMTP connection requires queries against the entire IP
        address. For IPv6, reverse DNS checks by SMTP servers may inadvertently induce DDoS effects
        against DNS while also consuming the server's connection resources waiting for reverse DNS
        responses. Prior IPv4 mapping of reverse DNS avoided a sizable waste of resources while
        defending open services. However, prior mapping of reverse DNS is not practical with IPv6
        making it impossible to defend against DDoS effects or excessive resource loss while
        checking the reverse namespace.</t>
      <t>Alternatively, costs related to blocking port 25 by Customer-Premises Equipment should be
        negligible. Network providers should offer different services to isolate residential from
        commercial use, in a manner analogous to IPv4 reverse PTR records designating dynamic and
        static assignments. Residential systems sending email to SMTP's public port 25, for the most
        part, represent compromised systems. Blocking this category of traffic would be much safer
        than expecting recipients to check the reverse namespace. Windows, OS X, and iOS employ the
        IPv6 privacy extensions <xref target="RFC4941"/> where any problematic IP address is likely
        to be reassigned different addresses regularly and remain valid beyond the reassignment
        interval.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Maintaining Trust">
      <t>Not every subsystem or protocol layer should be expected to repeat previous security
        checks, however critical checks should not be assumed, especially those that involve a
        trivial amount of effort. With high levels of abuse resulting from email's open nature,
        delegating checks in a structured manner better conserves essential resources. However,
        email's highly distributed store and forward protocol could not function if rigid message
        structures were enforced by the transport. New authentication or presentation requirements
        may involve small structural adjustments. For example, internationalization introduced a
        format negotiation not assured to survive beyond the next hop.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Responding to Defects and Exploitation">
      <t>With the advent of aviation, the world marveled at the skill and intellect taking us to
        ever greater heights. With aviation, faults threatening security, that when found, demanded
        our attention and diligence to effect repair. As with aviation, the success of email has
        risen to great heights. Email has become an integral component in general commerce and the
        maintenance of security such as reporting system failures, break-in attempts, and
        facilitating account access recovery.</t>
      <t>Reporting or predicting failure should not be viewed as exhibiting a lack of respect for
        achieved accomplishments. Noting and repairing faults only signify the importance of email's
        prominent role. As with most security related protocols, responding to noted defects is
        fairly common. Not responding to discovered defects in a security related protocol would be
        shocking.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="SMTP Can't">
      <t>SMTP <xref target="RFC5321"/> recommends against rejecting messages based upon perceived
        defects in the message structure. This liberal acceptance permits evolutionary changes in
        message specifications starting at <xref target="RFC0822"/> that was based on <xref
          target="RFC0733"/> replaced by <xref target="RFC2822"/> and again by <xref
          target="RFC5322"/>, <xref target="RFC6152"/>, <xref target="RFC6532"/>, and <xref
          target="RFC6854"/>; the second to last paragraph in section 3 of <xref target="RFC5321"/>
        provides a definitive statement messages should not be rejected due to perceived defects in
        the <xref target="RFC0822"/> message structure. The initial reference to <xref
          target="RFC0822"/> in this paragraph offers two foot notes with the second referencing the
        latest version of <xref target="RFC0822"/> which is <xref target="RFC5322"/> which itself
        has recently been updated. The impact of initially removing text specifically indicating
        which header fields are not to repeat is unknown. This information was implied within the
        then-new ABNF notation. Clarifying text for this requirement did not return until the <xref
          target="RFC0822"/> revision 19 years later which also indicates this specification's
        success at providing a foundation that allowed email to flourish.</t>
      <t>Expecting SMTP to validate message formats to protect against vulnerabilities pertaining to
        protocols such as DKIM does not scale. The general use of DKIM permits signature checks
        subsequent to acceptance where only the status of signatures determines internal placement.
        As such, it becomes critical to ensure a valid signature is never declared having malformed
        header field stacks. To accomplish this, the DKIM specification must change.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="DKIM Vulnerability">
      <t>DKIM permits a vulnerability by not checking the message header field stack for invalid
        repeats when signing or verifying a signature. The DKIM signature process must walk both
        down and then up the header field stack while selecting the header fields to be included in
        the hash process of the signature. The DKIM process will even ignore prefixed From header
        fields which is the only header field always included.</t>
      <t>The WG concluded that the "listing non-existent header fields as signed" hack added in
        non-normative language together with opinions that checking for invalid repeated header
        fields is to be considered SMTP's problem. This issue was expressed as not an attack against
        the trust DKIM intends to convey, and thus not a concern for DKIM. Nevertheless, improperly
        formed messages may display only the first of multiple header fields that, as a result of
        erroneous assumptions of there being no invalid repeated header fields, the prefixed header
        fields are likely to be displayed in lieu of those signed while not impacting DKIM's
        signature validity.</t>
      <t>DKIM incorrectly assumed the header field stack's starting conditions, which itself is best
        able to determine. This is likely to astonish most recipients that DKIM failed to make a
        robust effort to maintain the trust it is attempting to convey. As such, DKIM Signers may
        sign malformed messages (e.g., violate <xref target="RFC5322"/>). In addition, receivers
        will verify these messages as having valid signatures despite multiple instances of a header
        field only permitted to occur once. See addendum for examples.</t>
      <t>Use of DKIM on such messages exposes a vulnerability in the evaluation process. Rather
        ensuring essential checks are made prior to producing a result, a wasteful hack was later
        suggested where extra non-existent header fields could be included in the list of signed
        header fields. Any pre-pended header field added after signing would thereby change
        resulting hashes and invalidate the signature. Not all domains are attempting to achieve the
        same level of trust and may be more sensitive to incurring incremental storage requirements.
        Some domains may even inadvertently sign invalid repeated header fields because this check
        had not been required in the DKIM process. These same DKIM domains are also likely to
        establish themselves as being Too Big To Block. These TBTB domains can then be used to spoof
        other domains that may have otherwise established a high level of trust by implementing the
        hack where, due to this defect in DKIM, can still do nothing in their defense from the
        perspective of now deceived recipients.</t>
      <t>This vulnerability in DKIM represents an exploit allowing serious attacks caused by
        erroneous assumptions made in DKIM's signature process. There is also a header field, which
        because of its label, may potentially mislead recipients into believing it contains valid
        "Authentication-Results" <xref target="RFC5451"/>. Common phrases such as
        "Authentication-Results", "pass", and "fail", rather than use of result codes belies
        introductory claims this header is not intended for direct human consumption.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Barriers to an Authenticated Domain">
      <t>Many advocate either SPF or DKIM as a means to obtain domain references based on the
        increased prevalence of these protocols. DKIM is independent of the domain actually sending
        the message and the recipient by design. Unfortunately, DKIM also does not attempt to
        protect against likely abuses that are also beyond the control of the signing domain in
        which DKIM signature validity conveys no assurance pre-fixed header fields have not changed
        what recipients see. As such, DKIM signing domains can not be held accountable for incidents
        of abuse appearing to violate subscription policies or that spoof other domains.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Mail From Parameter and SPF">
      <t>Access to outbound SMTP servers may or may not restrict the Mail Parameter use. A strategy
        used to control abuse might rely upon rate limits and denial of access subsequent to abuse
        reports. Reasons for publishing SPF records might be to mitigate backscatter based on
        records that offer Non-Delivery-Notifications (NDNs) authorization by the Mail From
        parameter where the loss of some of these notifications is considered acceptable. This
        mechanism does not offer a positive basis for identification. Its intent is to constrain the
        number of invalid NDNs being returned when someone spoofs their domain. Evidence of this
        intent might be denoted by SPF record's ending or providers overriding them with "?all".</t>
      <t>SPF failure rates of even a few percent are too high for it to offer a solid basis for
        either acceptance or rejection. There are some policy strategies for specific domains that
        attempt to combine SPF and DKIM where when either of their related domains manage to pass,
        only then is the message to be placed in the in-box.</t>
      <t>Domains that reference SPF resource records should not be considered authenticated because
        the SPF process authorized the SMTP client. Often an SMTP client is shared by many domains.
        As such, it would be incorrect to assume SPFv1 records that authorize a provider by way of
        the Mail Parameters is only permitted by authenticated accounts from that domain.</t>
      <t>As a result, no domain information in SPF or DKIM, under current circumstances, can be used
        as a domain reference for either acceptance or reputation.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="IPv6 and SPF with PTR or local-part Macros">
      <t>When IPv6 becomes more commonly used, some will attempt white-listing IP addresses as a
        practical albeit non-scalable method to deal with the highly increased address range
        confronted when dealing with IPv6. There are currently no practical solutions able to scale
        to the challenging range of IP addresses that might be controlled by malefactors.</t>
      <t>Unlike most DNS resources that segregate IPv4 and IPv6 datasets, SPF consolidates both IPv4
        and IPv6 addresses into a common list comprised of a chain of DNS transactions. In addition
        to explicit chaining, SPF expects receivers to process the first SPF resource record which
        may contain 10 SPF mechanisms. Each mechanism may then require an additional 10 DNS
        transactions to resolve the mechanism's status. According to <xref target="spf-all.com"/>
        out of 112,311,175 domains, 24,073,182 (21.4 %) publish SPF records where only 12,768
        (0.053%) employ macros. Even the 0.053% figure overstates use since many represent
        questionable server farm deployments. These are questionable since many major providers do
        not process SPF records that contain macros. Non-implementation of macros is very good from
        a security and reliability perspective, but problematic for email's integrity when used.</t>
      <section title="Problems with Macros">
        <t>Ask a group of email providers about SPF, and you'll likely hear SPF is used to identify
          IP addresses used by a domain to send email. With this information, they can check these
          addresses against popular reputation services to determine where there are problems.
          Silent discard or placement into spam folders reduces delivery status integrity and makes
          supporting unreliable delivery difficult. When SPF was first introduced, AOL claimed they
          used SPF to create IP address white-lists based upon domains with whom they collaborate.
          White-listing would be less effective if macros were used in SPF records to change
          results.</t>
        <t>SPF also includes macros run by recipients that can expand the local-part of the Mail
          From parameter or the IP address of the SMTP client into labels used in subsequent DNS
          queries. Expressing an IPv6 address using the SPF macro in the reverse order nibble form
          can comprise a query containing more than 32 labels. If local-part macros are used to
          locate 10 MX records, the combined targets for these MX records can comprise a set of 100
          separate hostnames. Local-part macros can also be used to chain SPF record sets making
          forensic review difficult. The latest <xref target="I-D.ietf-spfbis-4408bis"/> offers a
          "(do not use)" statement for the PTR mechanism and the {%p} macro. Because macros pose a
          serious interchange risk when relied upon, all macros should be listed as "(do not use)".
          In the case of the PTR mechanism, the {%p} and {%l} macros should include the statement
          "(do not use and do not implement)."</t>
        <t>The use of the PTR mechanism may place a burden on the DNS servers offered by the
          sender's network provider. The use of {%l} macro can potentially place a sizeable burden
          on ANY network at little cost to malefactors. The change in this version of SPF that
          limits the number of NX Domain responses will constrain attacks to being against any
          wildcard resource. Unfortunately, synthetic domains have become a popular alternative to
          the use of Web cookies.</t>
        <t>It should also be pointed out use of macros may not function when <xref target="RFC6531"
          /> permits international email addresses which includes both local-part and domain
          portions of the email address. Tests and comments by large email providers show an
          understandable reluctance to process SPF macros where often they simply do not implement
          the macro portion of SPF. </t>
        <t>The SPF review documented in <xref target="RFC6686"/> failed to provide a breakdown on
          macro use. SPF's macros can prove hazardous, especially with IPv6. Rather than permitting
          receivers to decide their acceptance methods, an SPF resource record based on the Mail
          From parameter can induce 100 DNS transactions using labels constructed from random
          strings found in the message local-part. While recent changes made in the current version
          of SPF recommends against its use, to process the reverse namespace may place an extreme
          burden on DNS, its cache, and the SMTP server's connection resources. Too bad unrelated
          DNS providers where not afforded similar consideration.</t>
        <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-spfbis-4408bis"/> purports to be documenting current use. It
          dropped the SPF resource record (99) due to sparse use and recommends against reverse PTR
          use. If a similar threshold were applied, all the SPF macro expansion aspects of this
          protocol would be removed as well. Several large providers have offered their assurance
          that their SPF libraries had these macros removed. Any effort hoping to define current use
          MUST carefully reconsider the inclusion of this ill-considered macro feature. Otherwise,
          it can not be suggested SPF-bis simply documents current use.</t>
        <t>Danger imposed by the use of the local-part macro is inherent in the query required to
          support both an IPv6 expansion, in conjunction with the expansion of local-part macros
          induced by possibly cached SPF records. The local-part, along with a range of IP addresses
          made readily possible by IPv6, can be manipulated to induce a flurry of large DNS
          transactions directed toward any otherwise uninvolved domain, all directed by cached DNS
          records that contain active content.</t>
        <t>It is never a good idea to allow free attacks enabled through foreign scripts. The SPF
          local-part macro would allow a cached DNS record to be repeatedly exploited by a spam
          campaign with an attacker consuming little of their resources beyond what they already use
          in the campaign. In this case, their recipients change the domains queried on behalf of
          the attackers based upon the same SPF resource record. High levels of amplification still
          apply if SPF specifications are not changed and resulting implementation are then assumed
          part of some greater security requirement and are no longer deemed experimental. The SPF
          macro DOS overview demonstrated in 2006 <xref target="otis-spf-dos-exploit"/> did not
          consider IPv6 use which offers higher gain, where the gain achieved sending a single 1KB
          message to a single recipient offered a 1:156 reflected gain over IPv4 that can never be
          filtered or blocked by using BCP38 <xref target="RFC2827"/>. When made against a wildcard
          record, even higher gains can be achieved.</t>
        <t>Logically, local-part macros would not safely provide positive results without the query
          being combined with an IP address list of SMTP clients in some form. A list structure
          would need to be repeated for each user. Rcpt To using schemes like BATV provides an
          expedient way where the purported sender determines whether a NDN can be returned without
          the risk associated with active content placed within DNS resource records. Several
          parsers ignore local-part macro expansion since they rarely play any role in providing
          positive results.</t>
        <t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-spfbis-4408bis"/> Addendum E indicates a possible use of SPF
          macros such as exists:{%l}._spf.{%d} or exists:{%i}_spf.{%d} can be used in "specialized"
          DNS servers able to understand encrypted local-parts or react to inordinate query rates
          which suggests use of resource records having extremely short TTLs. Such an approach can
          add a sizeable burden on recipients and targeted DNS servers. Such a scheme represents a
          poor alternative to providing authenticated domain identifiers. The general intent and
          purpose of SPF is to offer Non-Delivery Notification authorization where no macros are
          required and by most practical measure are not being used.</t>
        <t>The Purported Responsible Address (PRA) alternative attempted to overcome the relatively
          high path registration failure rates normally experienced with SPF. Neither scheme offered
          authenticated domain identifiers and left recipients prone to being spoofed by relying on
          authorizations. DKIM was intended to help solve these related spoofing issues, but failed
          as currently specified.</t>

    <section title="Domains as a Basis for Managing Traffic">
      <t>A manageable basis for assessments can leverage a smaller number of related domains,
        compared to IPv6 or even IPv4 addresses. Although technically the domain name space can be
        larger than the massively large IPv6 address space, in practice it is not. One hundred
        thousand domains control 90% of Internet traffic out of approximately 100 million domains
        active each month. The top 150 domains control 50% of the traffic, and the top 2,500 domains
        control 75%. This level of domain consolidation permits effective fast-path white-listing.
        Improvements achieved using domains to consolidate the threat landscape can easily justify
        added cryptographic authentication burdens. Even APL resource records <xref target="RFC3123"
        /> can authenticate EHLO using a single DNS transaction, but this would not allow IPv6 email
        to be more easily managed, which cryptographic technology can offer.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="XMPP Shows the Way Forward">
      <t>In addition to SMTP <xref target="RFC5321"/> using StartTLS <xref target="RFC3207"/> XMPP
          <xref target="RFC6122"/> uses StartTLS <xref target="RFC6120"/> over a different port with
        many of the features used by web servers such as <xref target="RFC2560"/> as one means to
        increase scalability. It seems plausible that by defining SMTP access over port 465 is where
        a new authentication and international requirements can be resolved together.</t>
      <t>Many administrators overlook a serious problem made much worse by chatty protocols that
        impose processing delays. Examining server logs will not reveal any problem either, because
        the limited resource being consumed is the number of outstanding connections TCP is able to
        support. Reaching this limit will prevent new connections from being instantiated but this
        is not logged as an event. Over time administrators may hear complaints email is not being
        delivered or just see an ever growing percentage of spam.</t>
