Internet-Draft              PCP DHCP Options               February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document defines DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options
   which can be used to provision PCP Server [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] names.
   Motivations for expressing the PCP option as a textual string rather
   than a 32 or 128-bit binary address are discussed in Appendix A.

   In order to make use of these options, this document assumes
   appropriate name resolution means (e.g., Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123])
   are available on the host client.

   The use of DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment scenario.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  PCP Server denotes a functional element which receives and
      processes PCP requests from a PCP Client.  A PCP Server can be co-
      located with or be separated from the function (e.g., NAT,
      Firewall) it controls.  Refer to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].
   o  PCP Client denotes a PCP software instance responsible for issuing
      PCP requests to a PCP Server.  Refer to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].
   o  DHCP refers to both DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315].
   o  DHCP client (or client) denotes a node that initiates requests to
      obtain configuration parameters from one or more DHCP servers.
   o  DHCP server (or server) refers to a node that responds to requests
      from DHCP clients.
   o  Name is a UTF-8 [RFC3629] string that can be passed to getaddrinfo
      (Section 6.1 of [RFC3493]), such as a DNS name, address literals,
      etc.  The name MUST NOT contain spaces or nulls.  A name may be a
      fully qualified domain name (e.g., "myservice.example.com."), IPv4
      address in dotted-decimal form (e.g., 192.0.2.33) or textual
      representation of an IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:db8::1)
      [RFC4291][RFC5952].


3.  DHCPv6 PCP Server Option

   This DHCPv6 option conveys a name to be used to retrieve the IP
   addresses of PCP Server(s).  Appropriate name resolution queries
   should be issued to resolve the conveyed name.

3.1.  Format

   The format of the DHCPv6 PCP Server option is shown in Figure 1.

                  Figure 1: PCP Server Name DHCPv6 Option

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   o  Option-code: OPTION_PCP_SERVER (TBA, see Section 8.1)
   o  Option-length: includes total length of all following option data
      in octets.
   o  Name-length (one-octet field): Includes the length of the PCP
      Server Name, in octets.
   o  PCP Server Name (variable): The name of the PCP Server to be used
      by the PCP Client.  The name is encoded as a UTF-8 [RFC3629]
      string.

   The OPTION_PCP_SERVER option can include multiple PCP Server names;
   each name is treated as a separate PCP Server.  When several names
   are to be included, "Name-length" and "PCP Server Name" fields are
   repeated.

3.2.  Client Behavior

   To discover a PCP Server [I-D.ietf-pcp-base], the DHCPv6 client MUST
   include an Option Request Option (ORO) requesting the DHCPv6 PCP
   Server Name option as described in Section 22.7 of [RFC3315] (i.e.,
   include OPTION_PCP_SERVER on its OPTION_ORO).

   If the DHCPv6 client receives an OPTION_PCP_SERVER option from the
   DHCPv6 server, it extracts the name(s) conveyed in the
   OPTION_PCP_SERVER option.  A name is considered as valid if it is a

   legal UTF-8 string which does not contain any spaces or nulls.  Below
   are listed some additional validation rules:

   o  The trailing dot is optional when a domain name is conveyed in the
      option.

   o  IPv6 addresses MUST NOT be enclosed in brackets.

   o  A domain name is structured as one or more labels concatenated
      with dots.  A label MUST have no more than 63 characters.

   The DHCPv6 client MUST silently ignore invalid names.

   Once each name conveyed in the OPTION_PCP_SERVER option is validated,
   the DHCPv6 client MUST follow the procedure specified in Section 5.


4.  DHCPv4 PCP Option

4.1.  Format

   The PCP Server Name DHCPv4 option can be used to configure a name to
   be used by the PCP Client to contact a PCP Server.  The format of
   this option is illustrated in Figure 2.

               Option- Name-
          Code length length    PCP Server Name

         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--


                  Figure 2: PCP Server Name DHCPv4 Option

   The description of the fields is as follows:
   o  Code: OPTION_PCP_SERVER (TBA, see Section 8.2);
   o  Option-length: includes total length of all following option data
      in octets.  The maximum length is 255 octets.
   o  Name-length (one-octet field): Includes the length of the PCP
      Server Name, in octets.
   o  PCP Server Name (variable): The name of the PCP Server to be used
      by the PCP Client when issuing PCP messages.  The name is encoded
      as a UTF-8 [RFC3629] string.

   The OPTION_PCP_SERVER option can include multiple PCP Server names;
   each name is treated as a separate PCP Server.  When several names
   are to be included, "Name-length" and "PCP Server Name" fields are
   repeated.

Internet-Draft              PCP DHCP Options               February 2013


   The OPTION_PCP_SERVER DHCPv4 option is a concatenation-requiring
   option.  As such, the mechanism specified in [RFC3396] MUST be used
   if the PCP Server Name option exceeds the maximum DHCPv4 option size
   of 255 octets.

4.2.  Client Behavior

   DHCPv4 client expresses the intent to get OPTION_PCP_SERVER by
   specifying it in Parameter Request List Option [RFC2132].

   If the DHCPv4 client receives an OPTION_PCP_SERVER option from the
   DHCPv4 server, it extracts the name(s) conveyed in the option.  A
   name is considered as valid if it is a legal UTF-8 string which does
   not contain any spaces or nulls.  Below are listed some additional
   validation rules:

   o  The trailing dot is optional when a domain name is conveyed in the
      option.

   o  A domain name is structured as one or more labels concatenated
      with dots.  A label MUST have no more than 63 characters.

   The DHCPv4 client MUST silently discard non valid names.

   Once each name conveyed in the OPTION_PCP_SERVER option is validated,
   the DHCPv4 client MUST follow the procedure specified in Section 5.


5.  Use of PCP Server Names

   Each configured PCP Server Name is passed to the name resolution
   library (e.g., Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123] or [RFC6055]) to retrieve
   the corresponding IP address(es) (IPv4 or IPv6).  It is out of scope
   of this document to specify how the PCP Client selects the PCP
   Server(s) to contact.

   Multiple PCP Server Names may be configured to a PCP Client in some
   deployment contexts such as multi-homing.  It is out of scope of this
   document to enumerate all deployment scenarios which require multiple
   Names to be configured.

   A host may have multiple network interfaces (e.g, 3G, WiFi, etc.);
   each configured differently.  Each PCP Server learned MUST be
   associated with the interface via which it was learned.

Internet-Draft              PCP DHCP Options               February 2013


6.  Dual-Stack Hosts

   In some deployment contexts, the PCP Server may be reachable with an
   IPv4 address but DHCPv6 is used to provision the PCP Client.  In such
   scenarios, a plain IPv4 address or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address can be
   configured to reach the PCP Server.

   A Dual-Stack host may receive OPTION_PCP_SERVER via both DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6.  The content of these OPTION_PCP_SERVER options may refer to
   the same or distinct PCP Servers.  This is deployment-specific and as
   such it is out of scope of this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC3315] and
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] are to be considered.


8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  DHCPv6 Option

   Authors of this document request the following DHCPv6 option code:

                                Option Name Value
                          ----------------- -----
                          OPTION_PCP_SERVER TBA

8.2.  DHCPv4 Option

   Authors of this document request the following DHCPv4 option code:

                                Option Name Value

Appendix A.  Rationale

   The pcp WG consensus is to define a DHCP option which contains a
   string that can be passed to APIs (e.g., getaddrinfo()).  In
   particular, the option should be designed to include a name (e.g.,
   domain name [RFC2181]) or IP address literal string.  In such design,
   DHCP clients are expected to pass the conveyed string to any
   supported name resolution library (DNS is a name resolution service
   among others).  The underlying name resolution library is responsible
   for validating the name.

   Distinct IP-Address and Name DHCP options have been considered in
   early stages of this specification.  This flexibility aims to let
   service providers make their own engineering choices and use the most
   convenient option according to their deployment context.
   Nevertheless, the DHC WG's position is this flexibility has some
   drawbacks such as inducing errors (See Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines]).  Therefore, only the Name option
   is maintained within this document.

   This choice is motivated by operational considerations: In
   particular, some Service Providers are considering two levels of

   redirection:

   (1)  The first level is national-wise and undertaken by DHCP: a
        regional-specific Name will be returned;
   (2)  The second level is done during the resolution of the regional-
        specific Name to redirect the customer to a regional PCP server
        among a pool deployed regionally.

   Distinct operational teams are responsible for each of the above
   mentioned levels.  A clear separation between the functional
   perimeter of each team is a sensitive task for the maintenance of the
   offered services.  Regional teams will require to introduce new
   resources (e.g., new PCP-controlled devices such as Carrier Grade
   NATs (CGNs, [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements])) to meet an increase
   in customer base.  Operations related to the introduction of these
   new devices (e.g., addressing, redirection, etc.) are implemented
   locally.  Having this regional separation provides flexibility to
   manage portions of network operated by dedicated teams.  This two-
   level redirection can not be met by the IP Address option.

   In addition to the operational considerations:
   o  The use of the Name for NAT64 [RFC6146] might be suitable for
      load-balancing purposes;
   o  For the DS-Lite case [RFC6333], if the encapsulation mode is used
      to send PCP messages, an IP address may be used since the AFTR
      selection is already done via the AFTR_NAME DHCPv6 option
      [RFC6334].  Of course, this assumes that the PCP Server is co-
      located with the AFTR function.  If these functions are not co-
      located, conveying the Name would be more convenient.

A.1.  Dependency on Name Resolution

   The approach adopted in this document allows for an IP address or a
   Name to be returned in the specified DHCP option.  In particular, a
   server can resolve first the name and return in the option the
   resolved IP address(es).  For deployments where this is not possible,
   the server can return a name which will be resolved by the host
   embedding the client.  This document does not have any requirement on
   the underlying name resolution library (in particular, DNS is not
   assumed as the only available name resolution service).

   Returning a Name requires the host to embed a name resolution
   service.  Some may present this as an argument against defining a
   Name option.  Nevertheless, this argument may be objected as
   implementing a name resolution library (e.g., embed a DNS resolver)
   is cheap and devices which don't embed DNS resolver are uncommon.
