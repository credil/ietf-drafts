           Military Message Handling System (MMHS) over SMTP
                     draft-melnikov-mmhs-profile-00

Abstract

   A Miltary Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal messages
   ensuring release, distribution, security, and timely delivery across
   national and international strategic and tactical networks.  The MMHS
   Elements of Service are defined as a set of extensions to the ITU-T
   X.400 (1992) international standards and are specified in STANAG 4406
   Edition 2 or ACP 123.  This document specifies how a comparable
   messaging service can be provided using SMTP and its extensions.
