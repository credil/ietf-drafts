INTERNET DRAFT    E-VPN OAM Requirements and Framework      July 3, 2013


1  Introduction

   This document specifies the requirements and defines a reference
   framework for Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) Operations, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM, [RFC6291]). In this context, we use the term E-VPN
   OAM to loosely refer to the OAM functions required for and/or
   applicable to [E-VPN], [PBB-EVPN] as well as [TRILL-EVPN].

   E-VPN introduces an L2VPN solution for multipoint Ethernet services,
   with advanced multi-homing capabilities, using BGP for distributing
   customer/client MAC address reach-ability information over the core
   MPLS/IP network.

   PBB-EVPN combines Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) [802.1ah] with E-
   VPN in order to reduce the number of BGP MAC advertisement routes,
   provide client MAC address mobility using C-MAC aggregation and B-MAC
   sub-netting, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active
   flows, offer per site policies and avoid C-MAC address flushing on
   topology changes.

   TRILL-EVPN provides a solution for interconnecting TRILL [TRILL]
   networks over an MPLS/IP network using E-VPN, with two key
   characteristics: C-MAC address transparency on the hand-off point and
   control-plane isolation among the interconnected TRILL networks.

   This document focuses on the fault management and performance
   management aspects of E-VPN OAM.

1.1 Relationship to Other OAM Work

   This document leverages concepts and draws upon elements defined
   and/or used in the following documents:

   [RFC6136] specifies the requirements and a reference model for OAM as
   it relates to L2VPN services, pseudowires and associated Public
   Switched Network tunnels. This document focuses on VPLS and VPWS
   solutions and services.

   [RFC4379] defines mechanisms for detecting data plane failures in
   MPLS LSPs, including procedures to check the correct operation of the
   data plane, as well as mechanisms to verify the data plane against
   the control plane. 

   [802.1Q] specifies the Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
   protocol, which defines the concepts of Maintenance Domains,
   Maintenance End Points, and Maintenance Intermediate Points.

   [Y.1731] extends Connectivity Fault Management in the following

   areas: it defines fault notification and alarm suppression functions
   for Ethernet.  It also specifies mechanisms for Ethernet performance
   management, including loss, delay, jitter, and throughput
   measurement.

1.2  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3 Terminology

   This document uses the following terminology defined in [RFC6136]:

   MEP         Maintenance End Point is responsible for origination and
               termination of OAM frames for a given MEG.

   MIP         Maintenance Intermediate Point is located between peer
               MEPs and can process and respond to certain OAM frames
               but does not initiate or terminate them.

   Maintenance Domain  OAM Domain represents a region over which OAM 
                       frames can operate unobstructed.

2 E-VPN OAM Framework

2.1 OAM Layering

   Multiple layers come into play for implementing an L2VPN service
   using the E-VPN family of solutions:

   - The Service Layer runs end to end between the sites, or Ethernet
   Segments, that are being interconnected by the E-VPN solution. It can
   be either Ethernet (as in [E-VPN], [PBB-EVPN] and [SPB-EVPN]) or
   TRILL (as in [TRILL-EVPN]).

   - The Network Layer extends in between the E-VPN PE nodes and is
   mostly transparent to the core nodes (except where Flow Entropy comes
   into play). It leverages MPLS for service (i.e. EVI) multiplexing and
   Split-Horizon functions.

   - The Transport Layer is dictated by the networking technology of the
   PSN. It may be either based on MPLS LSPs or IP.

   - The Link Layer is dependent upon the physical technology used.
   Ethernet is a popular choice for this layer, but other alternatives
   are deployed (e.g. POS, DWDM etc...).

   This layering extends to the set of OAM protocols that are involved
   in the ongoing maintenance and diagnostics of E-VPN networks. The
   figure below depicts the OAM layering, and shows which devices have
   visibility into what OAM layer(s).

                      Figure 2: E-VPN OAM Example

2.2 E-VPN Service OAM

   The E-VPN Service OAM protocol depends on what service layer
   technology is being interconnected by the E-VPN solution. In case of
   [E-VPN] and [PBB-EVPN], the service layer is Ethernet; hence, the
   corresponding service OAM protocol is Ethernet Connectivity Fault
   Management (CFM) [802.1Q]. Whereas, in the case of [TRILL-EVPN], the
   service layer is TRILL and the associated service OAM protocol is
   TRILL OAM [TRILL-OAM].

   E-VPN service OAM is visible to the CEs and E-VPN PEs, but not to the
   core (P) nodes. This is because the PEs operate at the Ethernet MAC
   layer in [E-VPN][PBB-EVPN], or the TRILL RBridge layer in [TRILL-
   EVPN], whereas the P nodes do not.

   The E-VPN PE MUST support MIP functions in the applicable service OAM
   protocol (Ethernet CFM or TRILL OAM). 

   The E-VPN PE SHOULD support MEP functions in the applicable service
   OAM protocol.

2.3 E-VPN Network OAM

   E-VPN Network OAM is visible to the PE nodes only. This OAM layer is
   analogous to VCCV [RFC5085] in the case of VPLS/VPWS. It provides
   mechanisms to check the correct operation of the data plane, as well
   as a mechanism to verify the data plane against the control plane.
   This includes the ability to perform fault detection and diagnostics
   on:

   - the MP2P tunnels used for the transport of unicast traffic between
   PEs. E-VPN allows for three different models of unicast label

   assignment: label per EVI, label per <ESI, Ethernet Tag> and label
   per MAC address. In all three models, the label is bound to an E-VPN
   Unicast FEC. 

   E-VPN Network OAM MUST provide mechanisms to check the operation of
   the data plane and verify that operation against the control plane
   view for the E-VPN Unicast FEC.

   - the MP2P tunnels used for aliasing unicast traffic destined to a
   multi-homed Ethernet Segment. The three label assignment models,
   discussed above, apply here as well. In all three models, the label
   is bound to an E-VPN Aliasing FEC. E-VPN Network OAM MUST provide
   mechanisms to check the operation of the data plane and verify that
   operation against the control plane view for the E-VPN Aliasing FEC.

   - the multicast tunnels (either MP2P or P2MP) used for the transport
   of broadcast, unknown unicast and multicast traffic between PEs. In
   the case of ingress replication, a label is allocated per EVI or per
   <EVI, Ethernet Tag> and is bound to an E-VPN Multicast FEC. In the
   case of LSM, and more specifically aggregate inclusive trees, again a
   label may be allocated per EVI or per <EVI, Ethernet Tag> and is
   bound to an E-VPN Multicast FEC. 

   E-VPN Network OAM MUST provide mechanisms to check the operation of
   the data plane and verify that operation against the control plane
   view for the E-VPN Multicast FEC.

   - the correct operation of the ESI split-horizon filtering function.
   In E-VPN, a label is allocated per multi-homed Ethernet Segment for
   the purpose of performing the access split-horizon enforcement. The
   label is bound to an E-VPN Ethernet Segment FEC. 

   E-VPN Network OAM MUST provide mechanisms to check the operation of
   the data plane and verify that operation against the control plane
   view for the E-VPN Ethernet Segment FEC.

   - the correct operation of the DF filtering function. 

   E-VPN Network OAM MUST provide provide mechanisms to check the
   operation of the data plane and verify that operation against the
   control plane view for the DF filtering function.

   E-VPN network OAM mechanisms MUST provide in-band management
   capabilities. As such, OAM messages MUST be encoded so that they
   exhibit identical entropy characteristics to data traffic.

2.4 Transport OAM for E-VPN

INTERNET DRAFT    E-VPN OAM Requirements and Framework      July 3, 2013


   The transport OAM protocol depends on the nature of the underlying
   transport technology in the PSN. MPLS OAM mechanisms
   [RFC4379][RFC6425] as well as ICMP [RFC792] are applicable, depending
   on whether the PSN employs MPLS or IP transport, respectively.

2.5 Link OAM

   Link OAM depends on the data link technology being used between the
   PE and P nodes. For e.g., if Ethernet links are employed, then
   Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] Clause 57 may be used.

2.6 OAM Inter-working

   When inter-working two networking domains, such as native Ethernet
   and E-VPN to provide an end-to-end emulated service, there is a need
   to identify the failure domain and location, even when a PE supports
   both the Service OAM mechanisms and the E-VPN Network OAM mechanisms.
   In addition, scalability constraints may not allow running proactive
   monitoring, such as Ethernet Continuity Check Messages (CCMs), at a
   PE to detect the failure of an EVI across the E-VPN domain. Thus, the
   mapping of alarms generated upon failure detection in one domain
   (e.g. native Ethernet or E-VPN network domain) to the other domain is
   needed. There are also cases where a PE may not be able to process
   Service OAM messages received from a remote PE over the PSN even when
   such messages are defined, as in the Ethernet case, thereby
   necessitating support for fault notification message mapping between
   the E-VPN Network domain and the Service domain.

   OAM inter-working is not limited though to scenarios involving
   disparate network domains. It is possible to perform OAM inter-
   working across different layers in the same network domain. In
   general, alarms generated within an OAM  layer, as a result of
   proactive fault detection mechanisms, may be injected into its client
   layer OAM mechanisms. This allows the client layer OAM to trigger
   event-driven (i.e. asynchronous) fault notifications. For example,
   alarms generated by the Link OAM mechanisms may be injected into the
   Transport OAM layer, and alarms generated by the Transport OAM
   mechanism may be injected into the Network OAM mechanism, and so on.

   E-VPN OAM MUST support inter-working between the Network OAM and
   Service OAM mechanisms. E-VPN OAM MAY support inter-working among
   other OAM layers.

3 E-VPN OAM Requirements

   This section discusses the E-VPN OAM requirements pertaining to Fault
   Management and Performance Management.

INTERNET DRAFT    E-VPN OAM Requirements and Framework      July 3, 2013


3.1 Fault Management Requirements

3.1.1 Proactive Fault Management Functions

   Proactive fault management functions are configured by the network
   operator to run periodically without a time bound, or are configured
   to trigger certain actions upon the occurrence of specific events.

3.1.1.1 Fault Detection (Continuity Check)

   Proactive fault detection is performed by periodically monitoring the
   reachability between service endpoints, i.e. MEPs in a given MA,
   through the exchange of Continuity Check messages. The reachability
   between any two arbitrary MEPs may be monitored for:

   - a specified path taken by a particular user data flow. This enables
   per flow monitoring between MEPs. E-VPN Network OAM MUST support
   fault detection with per user flow granularity. E-VPN Service OAM MAY
   support fault detection with per user flow granularity.

   - a representative path. This enables liveness check of the nodes
   hosting the MEPs but does not conclusively indicate liveness of the
   path(s) taken by user data traffic. This enables node failure
   detection but not path failure detection, through the use of a test
   flow. E-VPN Network OAM and Service OAM MUST support fault detection
   using test flows.

   - all paths. For MPLS/IP networks with ECMP, monitoring of all
   unicast paths between MEPs may not be possible, since the per-hop
   ECMP hashing behavior may yield situations where it is impossible for
   a MEP to pick flow entropy characteristics that result in exercising
   the exhaustive set of ECMP paths. Monitoring of all ECMP paths
   between MEPs is not a requirement for E-VPN OAM.

   The fact that MPLS/IP networks do not enforce congruency between
   unicast and multicast paths means that the proactive fault detection
   mechanisms for E-VPN MUST provide procedures to monitor the unicast
   paths independently of the multicast paths. This applies to E-VPN
   Service OAM and Network OAM.

3.1.1.2 Defect Indication

   E-VPN Service OAM MUST support event-driven defect indication upon
   the detection of a connectivity defect. Defect indications can be
   categorized into two types: forward and reverse defect indications.

3.1.1.2.1 Forward Defect Indication

INTERNET DRAFT    E-VPN OAM Requirements and Framework      July 3, 2013


   This is used to signal a failure that is detected by a lower layer
   OAM mechanism. Forward Defect indication is transmitted by a server
   MEP (i.e. an actual or virtual MEP) in a direction that is away from
   the direction of the failure (refer to Figure 2 below).

   Forward defect indication may be used for alarm suppression and/or
   for purpose of inter-working with other layer OAM protocols. Alarm
   suppression is useful when a transport/network level fault translates
   to multiple service or flow level faults. In such a scenario, it is
   enough to alert a network management station (NMS) of the single
   transport/network level fault in lieu of flooding that NMS with a
   multitude of Service or Flow granularity alarms. E-VPN PEs SHOULD
   support Forward Defect Indication in the Service OAM mechanisms.

3.1.1.2.2 Reverse Defect Indication (RDI)

   RDI is used to signal that the advertising MEP has detected a loss of
   continuity (LoC) defect. RDI is transmitted in the direction of the
   failure (refer to Figure 3).

   monitored service. E-VPN PEs SHOULD support Reverse Defect Indication
   in the Service OAM mechanisms.

3.1.2 On-Demand Fault Management Functions

   On-demand fault management functions are initiated manually by the
   network operator and continue for a time bound period. These
   functions enable the operator to run diagnostics to investigate a
   defect condition.

3.1.2.1 Connectivity Verification

   E-VPN Network OAM MUST support on-demand connectivity verification
   mechanisms for unicast and multicast destinations. The connectivity
   verification mechanisms SHOULD provide a means for specifying and
   carrying in the messages:

   - variable length payload/padding to test MTU related connectivity
   problems.

   - test frame formats as defined in Appendix C of [RFC2544] to detect
   potential packet corruption.

   E-VPN Network OAM MUST support connectivity verification at per flow
   granularity. This includes both user flows (to test a specific path
   between PEs) as well as test flows (to rest a representative path
   between PEs). 

   E-VPN Service OAM MUST support connectivity verification on test
   flows and MAY support connectivity verification on user flows.

   For multicast connectivity verification, E-VPN Network OAM MUST
   support reporting on:

   - the DF filtering status of specific port(s) or all the ports in a
   given bridge-domain.

   - the Split Horizon filtering status of specific port(s) or all the
   ports in a given bridge-domain.

3.1.2.2 Fault Isolation

   E-VPN OAM MUST support an on-demand fault localization function. This
   involves the capability to narrow down the locality of a fault to a
   particular port, link or node. The characteristic of forward/reverse
   path asymmetry, in MPLS/IP, renders fault isolation into a direction-
   sensitive operation. That is, given two PEs A and B, localization of
   connectivity faults between them requires running fault isolation

   procedures from PE A to PE B as well as from PE B to PE A.

   E-VPN Service OAM mechanisms only have visibility to the PEs but not
   the MPLS/IP P nodes. As such, they can be used to deduce whether the
   fault is in the customer's own network, the local CE-PE segment or
   remote CE-PE segment(s). E-VPN Network and Transport OAM mechanisms
   can be used for fault isolation between the PEs and P nodes.

3.2 Performance Management

   Performance Management functions can be performed both proactively
   and on-demand. Proactive management involves a scheduling function,
   where the performance management probes can be triggered on a
   recurring basis. Since the basic performance management functions
   involved are the same, we make no distinction between proactive and
   on-demand functions in this section.

3.2.1 Packet Loss

   E-VPN Network OAM SHOULD provide mechanisms for measuring packet loss
   for a given service.

   Given that E-VPN provides inherent support for multipoint-to-
   multipoint connectivity, then packet loss cannot be accurately
   measured by means of counting user data packets. This is because user
   packets can be delivered to more PEs or more ports than are necessary
   (e.g. due to broadcast, un-pruned multicast or unknown unicast
   flooding). As such, a statistical means of approximating packet loss
   rate is required. This can be achieved by sending "synthetic" OAM
   packets that are counted only by those ports (MEPs) that are required
   to receive them. This provides a statistical approximation of the
   number of data frames lost, even with multipoint-to-multipoint
   connectivity.

3.2.2 Packet Delay

   E-VPN Service OAM SHOULD support measurement of one-way and two-way
   packet delay and delay variation (jitter) across the E-VPN network.
   Measurement of one-way delay requires clock synchronization between
   the probe source and target devices. Mechanisms for clock
   synchronization are outside the scope of this document. Note that
   Service OAM performance management mechanisms defined in [Y.1731] and
   [TRILL-LOSS-DELAY] can be used.

   E-VPN Network OAM MAY support measurement of one-way and two-way
   packet delay and delay variation (jitter) across the E-VPN network.

   E-VPN OAM must provide mechanisms for:

   - Preventing denial of service attacks caused by exploitation of the
   OAM message channel.

   - Optionally authenticate communicating endpoints (MEPs and MIPs)

   - Preventing OAM packets from leaking outside of the E-VPN network or
   outside their corresponding Maintenance Domain. This can be done by
   having MEPs implement a filtering function based on the Maintenance
   Level associated with received OAM packets.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.
