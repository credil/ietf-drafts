      Retransmission for Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) Sessions
              draft-begen-avtext-retransmission-for-ssm-00

Abstract

   This document describes RTP retransmission for source-specific
   multicast (SSM) architectures with unicast feedback.  RTP payload
   format for retransmissions has been defined in RFC 4588, whereas the
   RTP profile an RTP receiver could use to issue RTP Control Protocol
   (RTCP) feedback messages and the format of these feedback messages
   have been defined in RFC 4585.  RFC 5760 defines the operation for
   SSM architectures with unicast feedback.

   First, we document potential issues that could arise when providing a
   retransmission service using RTP retransmission (RFC 4588 and RFC
   4585) for RFC 5760 architectures based on rules described in the
   relevant RFCs.  We then present solutions that allow to avoid
   unnecessary feedback suppression, provide enhanced retransmission
   services and address congestion control for retransmission in an SSM
   environment.  These solutions specify certain rules that apply to the
   distribution source, feedback target(s), retransmission source(s) and
   RTP receivers.

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


1.  Introduction

   The RTP toolkit is used to deliver a variety services over IP
   multicast.  [RFC5760] defines a source-specific multicast (SSM)
   architecture with one or several Media Senders, a Distribution Source
   (DS) (sourcing the SSM), one or several Feedback Targets (FT) that
   may or may not be co-joint with the DS and RTP receivers (RTP_Rx)
   that send unicast feedback to a FT.  This document explores the
   complications one might face when adding one or more Retransmission
   Sources (RSo) in this architecture for reliable multicast
   distribution.

   In this specification, we assume that FT and RSo logical entities are
   combined in a single physical entity and they share state.  In the
   remainder of the text, the term Retransmission Server (RS) is used
   whenever appropriate, to refer to this single physical entity.  As in
   [RFC6285], the RS receives the RTP packets sent in an SSM session (as
   a normal RTP_Rx), and buffers these packets for a certain time for
   retransmission purposes.

   The term RAMS (Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Sessions) will be used
   to refer to the protocol and architecture defined in [RFC6285].  The
   RAMS specification presents a method in which an RTP_Rx can rapidly
   acquire reference information transported in an SSM session.  This is
   enabled by having the RTP_Rx retrieve a unicast burst of data from an
   RS, formatted as RTP retransmission packets prior to joining the SSM
   session.  While the present document will include some requirements
   and observations expressed in [RFC6285], it will particularly focus
   on the impact of packet loss events experienced in an SSM
   distribution, and how the elements in the SSM architecture interact
   best to ensure impacted RTP_Rx's are provided with appropriate RTP
   retransmissions.

   A packet loss event in an SSM session, will in general trigger one or
   multiple interactions between the RTP_Rx and the FT/RS/DS entities:

   o  The RTP_Rx sending an RTCP NACK message to the FT ([RFC4585])

   o  The RTP_Rx receiving RTP retransmission(s) from the RS

   o  The RTP_Rx receiving an RTCP feedback message from the DS

   This document describes the behavior for all entities defined in an
   SSM architecture with unicast feedback as described in [RFC5760] (DS,
   FT, RS and RTP_Rx) addressing feedback implosion (avoidance),
   retransmission efficacy and congestion concerns.

   One application that can benefit from this document is IPTV.  In many

   IPTV deployments, streams are transported over SSM.  Transporting
   this data over SSM enables a packet loss recovery by means of RTP
   retransmissions and/or forward error correction (FEC)
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-dvb-al-fec].  This document focuses on
   retransmission.  Note that Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) forum has
   specified an RTP retransmission solution for its managed Linear Media
   Broadcast (LMB) service, and which references most of the relevant
   RTP specifications.  An overview of this solution is provided in
   Section 9.

3.  Definitions

   This document uses some acronyms and definitions which have been
   introduced [RFC6285] as the baseline.  Some of these definitions have
   been slightly retailored to fit the restricted scope of this
   document.

   (Primary) SSM (or Multicast) Session:  The multicast session to which
   RTP_Rx's can join at a random point in time.  A primary SSM session
   can carry multiple RTP streams.

   Primary Multicast RTP Session:  The multicast RTP session that is of
   interest to an RTP receiver.  It comprises the primary multicast RTP
   stream(s) and an associated unicast RTCP feedback stream to a
   Feedback Target.

   Primary Multicast (RTP) Streams:  The RTP stream(s) carried in the
   primary multicast RTP session.

   Source Filtering Group Management Protocol (SFGMP):  Following the
   definition in [RFC4604], SFGMP refers to the Internet Group
   Management Protocol (IGMP) version 3 [RFC3376] and the Multicast
   Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD) version 2 [RFC3810] in the IPv4 and
   IPv6 networks, respectively.  In the remainder of this document,
   SFGMP will refer to any group management protocol that has Join and
   Leave functionalities.

   Feedback Target (FT):  Unicast RTCP feedback target as defined in
   [RFC5760].  FT_Ap denotes a specific feedback target running on a

   particular address and port.

   Retransmission Packet:  An RTP packet that is formatted as defined in
   Section 4 of [RFC4588].  The payload of a retransmission packet
   comprises the retransmission payload header followed by the payload
   of the original RTP packet.

   (Unicast) Retransmission RTP Session:  The unicast RTP session used
   to send one or more unicast retransmission RTP streams and their
   associated RTCP messages.  This session is setup as described in
   [RFC6284].

   Retransmission Server (RS):  The RTP/RTCP endpoint that can generate
   the retransmission packets.

   New definitions introduced in this document are:

   Solicited Retransmission:  Retransmission packet(s) that are received
   by an RTP_Rx which have been explicitly requested by this RTP_Rx by
   means of one or more RTCP NACKs.

   Unsolicited Retransmission:  Retransmission packet(s) that are
   received by an RTP_Rx which have not been explicitly requested by
   this RTP_Rx by means of an RTCP NACK.

   Feedback Implosion/Storm:  The situation where multiple RTP receivers
   start sending (quasi-) simultaneously (RTCP) feedback, often
   triggered by an upstream packet loss event in the SSM tree impacting
   a large set of RTP receivers.


4.  Feedback Suppression and Retransmission for SSM: Applicable
    Specifications

   In this section we first look at the various specifications in place
   that describe the architecture for SSM with unicast feedback and
   determine how feedback suppression and retransmission are
   accomplished.

4.1.  RTCP Feedback Suppression in RFC 4585

   [RFC4585] defines an RTP profile for an RTP receiver that wishes to
   provide fast feedback by means of RTCP feedback messages, such as is
   applicable to an RTP retransmission scenario.  [RFC4585] defines the
   timing rules by which such RTCP feedback messages can be transmitted
   both in unicast and multicast/multi-party sessions, and it also
   defines the general format of RTCP feedback messages, as well as some
   specific feedback messages.  One of the transport-layer feedback

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


   messages that is particularly relevant here is the RTCP NACK message
   through which an RTP receiver can report missing packets.  The
   missing packets are identified by means of an SSRC identifier
   (associated with the primary multicast stream for which the DS uses
   this SSRC as media sender) and an RTP sequence number (SN).  The RS
   receiving such an RTCP NACK message can respond by sending
   retransmission packets whose format has been described in [RFC4588].
   An important aspect covered by [RFC4585] is feedback suppression for
   RTP receivers involved in a multi-party session in order to avoid
   feedback implosion.  To that extent, the RTP receiver waits for a
   (short) random dithering interval to check whether it sees a feedback
   message from any other RTP receiver reporting the same event.  If
   such a feedback message is received, the RTP receiver refrains from
   sending the feedback message and continues to follow the regular RTCP
   transmission schedule.  Note that a feedback message from one RTP
   receiver is typically not visible to other RTP receivers, so the FT
   might need to provide information to the RTP receivers.  We will
   investigate the implications of this feedback suppression rule for
   SSM architectures with unicast feedback as defined in [RFC5760],
   where one or multiple RS's are deployed.  To that extent we first
   provide an overview of how RTCP feedback messages transmitted by the
   RTP receivers are handled in the SSM architecture as specified by
   [RFC5760].

4.2.  RTCP Feedback Message Distribution in RFC 5760

   Two models in terms of DS behavior have been defined in [RFC5760]:

   o  In Feedback Summary Model, the unicast RTCP receiver report
      messages from the RTP_Rx's are by default aggregated at the DS and
      their information is transmitted as Receiver Summary Information
      (RSI) messages in the SSM session.  The RTCP feedback messages are
      by default terminated by the DS.  However, the DS might also
      aggregate or forward RTCP feedback messages and transmit them in
      the SSM session, when this is explicitly signaled.  Note that from
      the RTP perspective, the DS is an RTP_Rx generating its own RTCP
      receiver reports as well as other RTCP packets and sending them to
      the receiver group and media senders.

   o  In Simple Feedback Model, the DS reflects all RTCP messages
      (including RTCP feedback) received in unicast via the FT from the
      RTP_Rx's.  Note that many network topologies have a high degree of
      fanout, and also have a constrained link between the FT and the
      RTP_Rx's, so that reflecting all of the feedback messages is often
      not feasible.

   The communication between DS and disjoint FT(s) occurs as follows:




Begen & VanCaenegem     Expires February 11, 2013               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


   [RFC5760] indicates that for the Simple Feedback Model where the
   FT(s) are disjoint from the DS, the FT must forward all RTCP packets
   to the DS.

   [RFC5760] indicates the following for the Feedback Summary Model
   where the FT(s) are disjoint from the DS:

   o  The FTs may simply forward all RTCP packets incoming from the
      RTP_Rx's to the DS.

   o  The FTs may also perform aggregation of incoming RTCP packets and
      send only aggregated information to the DS.

   o  If the FT performs summarization functions, it must also act as a
      receiver and choose a unique SSRC for its own reporting towards
      the DS.

4.3.  RAMS

   Assume now that the FT is combined with an RSo, constituting together
   the RS, which provides retransmissions in response to unicast RTCP
   NACK messages received from RTP_Rx's.  Such architecture is described
   in [RFC6285] where the FT is co-joint with a Burst/Retransmission
   Source (BRS).

   Figure 1 shows the main entities involved in SSM with retransmission
   enabled.  They are

   o  Distribution Source

   o  Feedback Target (FT)

   o  Retransmission Source (RSo)

   o  RTP Receiver (RTP_Rx)

   The figure also shows the various RTP/RTCP flows and associated
   sessions.  The difference with RAMS is that the Burst/Retransmission
   Source (BRS) is replaced with a Retrasmission Source (RSo).  Another
   difference - not shown in the figure - is that next to the primary
   multicast session, there might also be a (source-specific) multicast
   retransmission session that can be sourced by the same DS entity
   (acting as an RS itself) or by the same RS that provides the unicast
   retransmissions.  This is discussed in more detail in Section 6.3.
   The unicast retransmission session must be established as per
   [RFC6284].  Note that when RAMS and retransmissions are provided for
   the same SSM session, a single unicast retransmission session is
   established.  The RAMS specification puts a constraint on the RS/FT,



Begen & VanCaenegem     Expires February 11, 2013               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


   stating that an FT (identified by means of IP address and port, and
   referred to as FT_Ap) must be associated with only a single RTP
   session.  This constraint was put in place, because an RTP_Rx using
   the RAMS service may not necessarily know the media sender SSRC a
   priori.  However, an RTP_Rx using the retransmission service can of
   course learn the SSRC by inspecting the SSRC identifier field in the
   RTP packets, and furthermore the SSRC field needs to be correctly
   filled out in the RTCP NACK message.  Thus, while we do not have this
   constraint on FTs when only the retransmission service is enabled,
   the contraint still applies when both RAMS and retransmission
   services are enabled.

5.  Pitfalls When Combining RTCP Feedback Handling and Retransmission
    Using RFC 5760 Rules

   In this section, we investigate a number of scenarios in terms of SSM
   topology and behavior of the DS with respect to the forwarding/
   termination of RTCP feedback messages received from RTP_Rx's.  In the
   first two scenarios, we assume there is only one FT.  Note that the
   DS could be joint with the FT or disjoint from the FT.

5.1.  Case of DS Forwarding/Reflecting All RTCP NACKs

   The forwarding of RTCP feedback messages is one option allowed for by
   the Feedback Summary Model of [RFC5760], where reflection is what the
   DS must do based on the Simple Feedback Model of RFC 5760.  In this
   case, RTP_Rx's applying the [RFC4585]suppression rule will result in
   the following:  when an RTP_Rx X reports a packet loss to the FT by
   sending an RTCP NACK, this message is distributed, via the FT and, by
   the DS via the SSM to all other RTP_Rx's.  If an RTP_Rx Y, different
   from RTP_Rx X, detected the same packet loss, but prior to sending
   out a NACK, this receiver Y gets the NACK message originally sent by
   X, it will refrain from sending a NACK, following [RFC4585].  The
   forwarding/reflection of RTCP NACK messages effectively results in
   feedback suppression, but obviously this is at the expense of limited
   visibility to the RS on which RTP_Rx suffered packet loss.  In
   general this will result in a decreased quality at the service layer
   for any RTP_Rx X, because the SSM receiver does not even get an
   opportunity to report its packet loss by means of an RTCP NACK.  Note
   that for packet losses upstream of the DS and which subsequently
   impact all RTP_Rx's, the DS does not need to be informed by each
   individual RTP_Rx about this packet loss.  When the DS is capable of
   recovering the lost packet in due time, it may send an unsolicited
   retransmission to all RTP_Rx's.  The reduced visibility to the RS of
   packet losses taking place downstream of the DS, could be compensated
   for by having the RS sending an unsolicited retransmission, whenever
   an RTCP NACK is received.  This will increase the chance on network
   congestion and will also consume RS processing resources when
   retransmissions are provided over unicast.  The conclusion is that
   reflection/forwarding of RTCP NACK messages by the DS is not (always)
   the "right" thing to do.

5.2.  Case of DS Terminating All RTCP NACKs

   Not forwarding and hence terminating RTCP feedback messages is the
   alternative option for a DS behaving in [RFC5760] Feedback Summary
   Model.  In this case every RTP_Rx that detects a packet loss event,
   will also transmit an RTCP NACK (assuming no congestion is sensed by
   the receiver, see Section 6.4.2 ).  We look at two example scenarios
   resulting in different consequences:  As a first example:  two or



Begen & VanCaenegem     Expires February 11, 2013              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


   multiple RTP_Rx's detect the same packet loss, which was caused by
   two or multiple un-related packet loss events taking place (quasi-)
   simultaneously.  This could be caused by link transmission errors,
   such as on xDSL links or in cable networks.  In this case, the RS
   will receive the NACKs from all impacted receivers, and can act
   accordingly by sending a unicast (solicited) retransmission to the
   impacted receivers.  As a second example, take the case considered
   previously where a packet loss event took place on the link between a
   media sender and the DS.  Because, even though the transmissions
   could be dispersed in a time frame Delta T, when a very large number
   of SSM receivers are impacted by the single packet loss event, a
   feedback implosion might occur.  This may load the network link(s)
   downstream of the RS and the RS itself, beyond its processing
   capabilities.  Clearly, this is a case where the feedback suppression
   rule of [RFC4585] would be useful.  The conclusion is that
   termination of RTCP NACK messages by the DS is not (always) the
   "right" thing to do.

5.3.  Case of Multiple FTs

   A specific case of SSM with unicast feedback, is where there are
   multiple FTs, disjoint from the DS.  Similar as before, in the
   considered architectures, each FT is combined with a retransmission
   source, constituting a retransmission server.  Note that the RS are
   generally not positioned in the direct SSM path between the DS and
   the RTP_Rx's, i.e., an RS is typically a leaf of the SSM tree.  This
   architecture provides a scalable solution for SSM with a large
   population of receivers, because it is able to distribute RTCP
   feedback processing loads across different entities in different
   parts of the network.  It is an architecture that is well suited for
   IPTV networks, where the DS is the head-end sourcing the SSM that
   carries video broadcast streams over IP.  Note that we again assume
   that the RTP_Rx's behave compliant to [RFC4585], inclusive
   conformance to the feedback suppression rule.  The previous
   discussions on feedback suppression (or absence of feedback
   suppression) and its consequences on retransmissions for the SSM with
   single FT topology remains applicable and valid for the SSM with
   multiple (disjoint) FTs topology.  A distributed FT architecture
   brings in an additional aspect that should be addressed, and a
   dedicated example packet loss event use case visualizes this.  The
   considered topology is a DS with two disjoint FT/RS entities, FT/RS 1
   and FT/RS 2 , where each FT receives RTCP messages from a separate
   group of RTP_Rx's.  The assumption is that

   o  An RTP packet (with RTP sequence number N) in the primary SSM got
      dropped in the network upstream of the FT 1 and upstream of the
      SSM receivers that report to FT 1.




Begen & VanCaenegem     Expires February 11, 2013              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


   o  The FT 2 and the SSM receivers reporting to FT 2 are not impacted
      by the packet loss event impacting FT 1.  This is because the FT 2
      and its reporting SSM receivers do not get the original SSM
      packets from the DS via the router where the packet loss impacting
      FT 1 took place.

   The FT 1 and its reporting SSM receivers experience a situation that
   is discussed in a previous section.  Because the packet loss event
   impacts all SSM receivers reporting to FT 1, it is important that
   those receivers in general suppress sending an RTCP NACK.  Hence
   having the FT 1 forwarding the first received RTCP NACK(s) from an
   RTP_Rx to the DS which then reflects/forwards the NACK over the
   original SSM, is the correct thing to do from that point of view.
   However, the reflection /forwarding of the NACK by the DS means that
   also the RTP_Rx's reporting to the FT 2 will suppress sending an RTCP
   NACK for packet N in the SSM.  As a consequence, a packet loss event
   involving an RTP packet with SN N impacting a single RTP_Rx reporting
   to FT 2 / RS 2 -e.g. due to a link transmission error- will not be
   reported by this RTP_Rx to RS 2.

   This means there is a discrepancy between the network reach of the
   suppression (covering all SSM receivers) and the actual network
   domain that was commonly impacted by the packet loss.  The RS 2 will
   in general not know whether there are any SSM receivers (reporting to
   FT 2) that missed RTP packet with RTP SN N. Note also that an
   unsolicited retransmission by RS 1 optionally following the loss
   detection for packet with SN N -can remain confined to the subdomain
   impacted by the loss, when the FT is co-located with the RS (using
   either unicast retransmission sessions or a multicast retransmission
   session sourced by the RS).

   SSM with multiple disjoint unicast FTs hence may result in efficient
   feedback storm suppression across all RTP_Rx's, but this also
   prevents any RTP_Rx from sending an RTCP NACK for detected packet
   loss, even when no feedback storm was imminent for the subdomain
   covered by a particular FT.  A solution for maximizing the
   retransmission service fulfillment may be for the DS to also act as
   RS and always send retransmissions requested by a particular FT, over
   a separate retransmission SSM to all RTP_Rx's.  However, this
   unnecessarily loads the network and requires all the SSM RTP
   receivers to join both a primary SSM and the multicast retransmission
   session.

5.4.  Takeaways

   The general conclusion from these three scenarios is that feedback
   suppression enabled by having the DS forwarding/reflecting RTCP
   Messages received from the RTP_Rx's or (disjoint) FTs is sometimes

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


   the right thing to do, but sometimes feedback suppression is not
   appropriate and interferes in a negative way with the packet loss
   reporting and retransmission service.


6.  Rules for SSM with Retransmissions

6.1.  Feedback Suppression Behavioral Requirements for DS, FT and
      RTP_Rx's

   The combination of the [RFC4585] suppression rule imposed on RTP_Rx's
   and the behavior of the DS and the FT(s) -when disjoint from the DS-
   as specified in [RFC5760], does result in non-ideal situations when
   deploying an SSM RTP session with Retransmission Server(s),
   especially for a large group of receivers.  In this section we
   provide some rules for DS and FT on the one hand and RTP_Rx's on the
   other hand, which impose a deviation respectively from rules defined
   in [RFC5760] and [RFC4585] , and which results in:

   o  All RTP_Rx's offering the opportunity to report detected packet
      loss by means of RTCP NACK when there is no risk on feedback
      implosion

   o  RTCP NACK suppression (only) when RTCP NACK implosion is imminent

   o  A better retransmission efficacy

   The rules apply to the transmission and handling of RTCP NACK
   messages by RTP_Rx's and FT, but similar rules may be applicable for
   other RTCP feedback messages that may or may not trigger dedicated
   service actions.

   Note that in the context of this document, the FT is part of a
   Retransmission Server, which is an RTP_Rx on its own.  In the
   remainder of this text, the term 'RTP_Rx' always refers to any RTP
   receiver reporting to a FT/RS and which does not host a FT/RS
   functionality, unless mentioned otherwise.

   The rules are:

   1.  A FT/RS that is disjoint from the DS MUST NOT forward nor reflect
       RTCP NACK messages received from the RTP_Rx's, to the DS.

       This behavior for a FT operating in an SSM enabled with
       retransmission is different from the behavior prescribed by
       [RFC5760] for a FT with a primary SSM operating in Simple
       Feedback mode.This rule will prevent feedback suppression at the
       RTP_Rx's directly triggered by RTCP feedback messages sent by



Begen & VanCaenegem     Expires February 11, 2013              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


       other RTP_Rx's.

   2.  A disjoint FT MAY send either an RTCP NACK or a 3rd party loss
       RTCP feedback message, each time using its own SSRC, to the DS.

       Note :  The third party loss message format is defined in
       [RFC6642].

       This behavior for a FT operating in an SSM enabled with
       retransmission is different from the behavior prescribed by
       [RFC5760] for a FT with a primary SSM operating in Simple
       Feedback mode.

       This rule will enable feedback suppression in the group of
       RTP_Rx's reporting to this FT (see recommendation 5).

       The FT/RS will send an RTCP NACK or 3rd party loss message
       depending on the location of the packet loss event:

       *  The FT/RS SHOULD send an RTCP NACK to the DS -using its own
          SSRC- when it detected packet loss itself (with the FT/RS
          acting as an RTP_Rx).

       *  The FT/RS SHOULD send an RTCP NACK or a third party loss
          message to the DS -using its own SSRC- when it did not detect
          packet loss itself, but there is a risk on feedback implosion.


       Feedback implosion risk detection by the FT without detecting
       directly packet loss, can be based on monitoring the amount of
       arriving RTCP NACKs from RTP_Rx's reporting the same packet loss,
       and setting a threshold as function of the known amount of RTP
       SSM receivers reporting to this FT/RS.

   3.  A DS MUST forward/reflect any RTCP NACK or RTCP third party loss
       feedback message received from FT entities on the primary SSM RTP
       session

   4.  When capable of detecting packet loss in the RTP streams received
       from the media senders, the DS MUST send an RTCP NACK using its
       own SSRC on the primary SSM RTP session and to the media senders

   5.  An RTP_Rx receiving a third party loss message or RTCP NACK in
       the primary SSM RTP session MUST conform to the following
       behavior:

       If the SSRC identifier in the 'packet sender SSRC' field in the
       received RTCP feedback message matches either



Begen & VanCaenegem     Expires February 11, 2013              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


       *  the SSRC of the (primary SSM) DS (this is the 'media sender
          SSRC')

       *  or the SSRC that is used by the FT/RS entity to which the
          RTP_Rx reports (see next section)

       the RTP_Rx MUST follow the feedback suppression rule defined in
       [RFC4585], i.e. it abstains from sending an RTCP NACK for the
       same SN.

       If there is no match with these SSRC values, the RTP_Rx SHOULD
       NOT apply the [RFC4585] feedback suppression rule

       This behavior is different from [RFC4585], and prevents feedback
       suppression when there is no risk on feedback implosion.

       If the RTP_Rx does not know the value of the SSRC that is used by
       the FT/RS entity -in its role towards the DS- to which the
       receiver reports, it MAY still send its own RTCP feedback
       message, when having detected the same packet loss, but
       respecting the [RFC4585]timing rules.

       RTP_Rx's that do not know the value of the SSRC that is used by
       its FT/RS entity in its primary SSM role and abstain from sending
       an RTCP NACK message when receiving such a message, implement
       feedback suppression and behave as defined in [RFC4585].

       The next section describes how an RTP_Rx knows the value of the
       SSRC that is used by the FT/RS entity to which the receiver
       reports

6.2.  Informing RTP_Rx's with the SSRC Value of FT/RS

   There are different SSRC values that can be associated to the FT/RS:

   o  As described in [RFC5760], in summary feedback model, the FT must
      act as a receiver and choose a unique SSRC for its own reporting
      towards the Distribution Source.  If a FT acts strictly according
      to the Simple Feedback Model of [RFC5760], it does not need a
      unique SSRC.  However, with the recommendation '2' of the previous
      section, the FT acts rather as translator when sending its own
      RTCP NACK or Third Party Loss message to the DS.  The FT selects a
      SSRC value in its role as translator between the RTP_Rx's and the
      DS.

   o  The FT is part of the RS and the RS will typically also act as
      RTP_Rx, being the most efficient way for obtaining and caching
      copies of RTP packets that are transmitted down the primary SSM



Begen & VanCaenegem     Expires February 11, 2013              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


      and providing retransmission from that RS.  The RS selects a SSRC
      value in its role as RTP_Rx as well, when reporting to the DS.
      Nothing prevents this SSRC value to be the same as the SSRC value
      used by the FT entity.

   o  An RS also takes a role as RTP sender towards each of the RTP_Rx's
      that established a unicast retransmission session.  In this
      unicast retransmission session, the SSRC used by the RS is the
      same as the SSRC value used by the DS in the primary SSM RTP
      session, as per [RFC4588].

   Note that the CNAME of the FT/RS associated with all these SSRC
   identifier values is one and the same.

   It is the SSRC value used by the FT acting as receiver/translator in
   the SSM with unicast feedback topology, that will be present in the
   'Packet Sender SSRC' field of the RTCP NACK or Third Party Loss
   message forwarded by the DS to the RTP_Rx's.  There can be several
   ways by which an RTP_Rx learns this SSRC value:

   1.  In-band :  applies only for the Feedback Summary Model, where by
       means of a new RSI "FT SSRC list" message, the DS provides a
       listing of all deployed FT_Ap's with the corresponding SSRC for
       each of these FTs/RSs.  FTs/RSs are identified by means of their
       IPv4/IPv6 address, optional port, and optional CNAME.  The DS can
       learn the SSRC value chosen by a FT/RS by inspecting RTCP
       messages received from the FT.  The DS sends regularly the RSI
       "FT SSRC list" message down the primary SSM, to give every RTP_Rx
       joining the SSM at a random time a chance to learn this SSRC
       value.

   2.  Application-specific :  a specific extension can be defined for
       the RAMS-I message that signals the SSRC value associated with
       the FT in its role as reporter to the DS.  This RAMS-I message is
       transferred in the Burst/Retransmission Session.

   3.  Out-of-band for either the Feedback Summary or Simple Feedback
       Model of SSM operation, by advertising the FT's SSRC as a media
       attribute for the FT in the SSM RTP session description
       [RFC5576].

   The out-of-band signaling mechanism requires the application
   signaling to know/learn the SSRCs deployed by the FTs prior to
   signaling this information to the RTP_Rx's.

6.3.  Unsolicited Retransmissions

   The method of providing an (unsolicited) RTP retransmission packet to
   a set of RTP_Rx's enables loss recovery for packet loss events
   impacting a large set of receivers without risk for feedback
   implosion.  Unsolicited retransmissions can be provided over each of
   the established unicast retransmission sessions or only once in a
   single multicast retransmission session, sourced either by the DS or
   by the RS.  Providing (unsolicited) retransmissions over a separate
   multicast retransmission RTP session has the following advantages:

   o  The retransmission packet is transmitted by the DS/RS only once,
      saving both network and server resources.

   o  The multicast retransmission packet is less likely to be blocked
      by any intermediate gateway or a middlebox on the path between the
      DS/RS and RTP_Rx.

   o  An RTP_Rx that joins the multicast retransmission RTP session via
      SFGMP, implicitly indicates it is willing to accept unsolicited
      retransmissions.

   The rules related to the feedback suppression in Section 6.1 do not
   impose an RS/DS implementation to provide (support for) unsolicited
   retransmissions.  In this document, we assume that whenever the FT/
   RS/DS supports solicited retransmission and it actively suppresses
   feedback by sending a RTCP NACK or 3rd party loss message, it might
   try to provide one or more subsequent unsolicited retransmissions.
   However, as it is the case with any RTP retransmission, such
   unsolicited retransmissions may or may not arrive at their
   destinations.

   The requirements for unsolicited retransmissions are:

   1.  Unsolicited retransmissions MAY be provided over a separate
       multicast retransmission that is sourced by the RS that also acts
       as retransmission server for the unicast retransmission sessions
       or by the DS that also sources the primary SSM session.

   2.  An RS SHOULD only send unsolicited retransmissions when it knows
       with a minimum certainty that the receiver has implemented
       feedback suppression for this specific packet (unicast
       retransmission) or a majority of the receivers have implemented
       feedback suppression (multicast retransmission).

   The same retransmission of a packet originally transmitted in the
   primary SSM can be sent in both a unicast retransmission session and
   multicast retransmission session.  The RTP_Rx will handle these two

   (solicited or unsolicited) packets as duplicate packets.

   Editor's note:  Should we define a means by which an RTP_Rx can
   indicate it does not want to receive unsolicited retransmissions in
   the unicast retransmission session?

6.4.  Congestion Control Considerations

6.4.1.  Congestion Control in RFC 4585 and in RAMS

   The RAMS document indicates that an RTP SSM distribution equipped
   with a retransmission/burst server can work reliably in both
   engineered and best-effort networks.  However, there is a difference
   in the core operation of RAMS and the core operation of a
   Retransmission-enabled SSM in terms of congestion risk and avoidance:

   1.  In RAMS, retransmission packets, constituting a burst from the
       RAMS server, are requested by an RTP_Rx prior to the moment the
       receiver joins the SSM session.  The Retransmission server bursts
       the retransmission packets to the receiver and instructs the
       receiver when to join the SSM, which will take place near the end
       of this burst.  The congestion control for the bursting process
       can hence be decoupled from the SSM distribution (and any
       congestion control taking place on the SSM).  RAMS discusses in
       more detail how to limit the risk on congestion for the RAMS
       bursts, especially in a best effort environment.

   2.  When using retransmission service for an SSM, retransmission
       packets are transmitted to and received by an RTP_Rx, while the
       RTP_Rx also receives simultaneously the SSM RTP session.  When
       used in best effort networks, packet losses can be caused by
       congestion or (access) transmission link errors.  If packets in
       the SSM are dropped because of congestion, there is a good chance
       that a subsequent retransmission will actually exaggerate the
       congestion situation (this will depend on the relative
       positioning of the congestion, the RS and the RTP_Rx in the
       considered SSM topology).

   [RFC4588] section 7 states:  'In a best-effort environment, the
   sender SHOULD NOT send retransmission packets without reducing the
   packet rate and bitrate of the original stream (for example, by
   encoding the data at a lower rate).'  In the context of SSM, some
   RTP_Rx's may observe packet loss (caused by congestion), other
   receivers receiving the same SSM may not.  As the DS transmits a
   single original stream to all SSM receivers, the recommendation from
   [RFC4588] for the DS to adapt its packet rate whenever an RTP_Rx is
   reporting packet loss, will impact all SSM receivers.  This would
   make SSM with retransmission service practically infeasible in best



Begen & VanCaenegem     Expires February 11, 2013              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


   effort networks.  It is also important to note that the
   retransmission server/sender may be different from the DS sending the
   original stream, especially in large-scale SSM applications.  Hence,
   to a large extent the SSM path from DS to an SSM receiver may be
   decoupled from the network path between RS and SSM receiver.  I.e. it
   is quite possible that the congestion on the SSM does not impact the
   network path taken by the retransmission packet(s).  For these
   reasons, a different recommendation is in place in terms of
   congestion handling when retransmission is applied in SSM with
   unicast feedback.

6.4.2.  Congestion Handling for SSM with Retransmissions

   In this section we formulate a set of rules for the RS in order to be
   cautious that retransmissions will not contribute to enhanced
   congestion situations on the SSM path between DS and RTP_Rx, but
   without imposing an explicit role to the RS to assist in (helping to)
   relieve any (potential) congestion between DS and RTP_Rx.  This
   results in a congestion control mechanism for an RS operating in an
   SSM deployment that is decoupled from the behavior of the DS which
   may use its own congestion control.

   Note:  in this section only congestion on the path from the RS
   towards the RTP_Rx is considered.  Congestion on the upstream path
   towards the FT/RS has been discussed in the context of feedback
   implosion risk and avoidance in the previous sections.

   Case:  Unmanaged Networks

   The general requirement is that for unmanaged networks, an RTP
   retransmission server for an SSM RTP session SHOULD keep track, on a
   per RTP_Rx basis, of the recent retransmission request pattern for
   that RTP_Rx.  The RS then behaves as follows:

   o  Initially and when an RTP_Rx sends a retransmission request for
      the first time to the FT/RS, the RS SHOULD assume there is no
      congestion between the DS and the RTP_Rx, unless the RS has
      information deduced or received not by way of RTCP NACKs through
      which it can assume the SSM path is likely congested.

      Such non-RTCP feedback information can be information coming from
      RTCP RR, other RTCP messages or any out-of-band signaling from the
      receiver or other network elements.

   o  An RS MAY respond to a retransmission request with one or more
      retransmission packets when the path from the DS to the RTP_Rx
      originating the request is assumed to be congestion free.

Internet-Draft       Retransmission for SSM Sessions         August 2012


   o  When an RS observes an increasing amount of retransmission
      requests from a single receiver, while having serviced all or most
      retransmission requests from that receiver, or the server receives
      information in a way different from RTCP NACKs which predicts or
      indicates that congestion may likely occur, it SHOULD stop
      responding to retransmission requests from that receiver.
      Equally, the RS SHOULD NOT send unicast unsolicited
      retransmissions to such receiver.

   o  When no other information is available, an RS MAY assume absence
      of congestion for an RTP_Rx when it has not received
      retransmission requests for a minimum duration of time.

   o  An RS sending unsolicited retransmissions over a dedicated
      retransmission multicast SHOULD only do so when it knows this will
      not cause or contribute to congestion on the primary SSM path for
      the large majority of primary SSM receivers.

   Detailed algorithms by which a RS can declare an RTP_Rx in a
   congestion state, or free from congestion, are not elaborated further
   upon in this document.

   Note 1:  an RS may correlate information it has on RTP_Rx's to make a
   judgement on congestion or congestion-free state of the SSM paths to
   other RTP_Rx's using the same RS.

   Note 2:  any congestion handling policy is orthogonal to any other
   policy maintained at the RS having to do with retransmission service
   access control e.g. using access control lists, IP anti-spoofing
   measures, authentication, etc.

   Note 3:  an algorithm similar to the one described above for
   congestion handling, but to handle a denial of service attack MAY be
   considered for the RS implementation, next to the other security
   considerations related to retransmission as discussed in section 12
   in [RFC4588].

   Equivalent requirements are formulated for an RTP_Rx in an unmanaged
   network, where retransmission is enabled:

   o  An RTP_Rx which senses that the net throughput of the combination
      of original RTP packets and retransmission packets decreases over
      time with increasing amount of retransmission requests and
      subsequent retransmissions, SHOULD cease making retransmission
      requests.

   o  An RTP_Rx may re-start sending out retransmission requests once
      the original SSM session is received with close-to-zero packet

      loss, and where any optional sporadic packet loss can be assumed
      to be attributed to link transmission errors.

   Case:  Managed Networks

   For managed networks congestion should not happen on the SSM path or
   otherwise be a rare event.  [RFC4588] states :  'If enhanced service
   is used, it should be made sure that the total bitrate and packet
   rate do not exceed that of the requested service.  It should be
   further monitored that the requested services are actually
   delivered.'

   Note:  The total bitrate and packet rate is the original data (or
   primary data) and retransmission data.

   This means that the network is engineered to make sure that the
   combined SSM packets and retransmission packets on the network paths
   to any RTP_Rx will not be impacted by congestion.

   An alternative approach is to engineer the network for the
   congestion-free transmission of the primary SSM data, where-as
   retransmissions are delivered without dedicated bandwidth engineering
   provisions or otherwise with limited engineering provisions, in a
   sense that up to a certain maximum rate and up to certain maximum
   burst size, the retransmission traffic can be delivered on a
   congestion-free path.

   In the engineered case for SSM where retransmissions are not taken
   into account for the bandwidth provisioning, the chance on having
   congestion in the retransmission session for SSM enabled with
   retransmission-only service is expected to be smaller compared to an
   SSM enabled with RAMS service.  This is because a single RAMS-R
   request results in a burst of packets in the retransmission session
   whereas retransmissions requests typically results in the
   transmission of only one or several retransmission packets, with
   retransmission requests being sporadic.

9.  RTP Retransmission Service in DVB IPTV

   RTP retransmission for linear IPTV streams has been specified in
   Annex D of [DVB-IPTV].  This ETSI document, produced by the DVB
   Technical Module on IP-Infrastructure (TM-IPI) specifies the
   interface of a managed IPTV service client, commonly called the Home
   Network End Device or HNED in DVB IPTV terms.  The DVB IPTV RTP
   retransmission solution in Annex D references [RFC3550], [RFC4585],
   [RFC4588] and the [RFC5760].  Its solution is hence very well aligned
   with the IETF RTP specifications and addresses feedback implosion and
   feedback suppression in a similar way as described in this document:

   o  The DVB Linear Media Broadcast (LMB) services are delivered over
      an RTP SSM that operates according to the summary feedback model
      defined in [RFC5760]

   o  RTCP NACK messages transmitted by HNEDs towards the FT('s) are not
      forwarded over the primary RTP SSM.

   o  An HNED enables feedback suppression when receiving an RTCP
      Feedforward message from the network.  This RTCP Feedforward (FF)
      message has the same format as an RTCP NACK message.

   o  The RTCP FF message stems from a 'so-called' upstream reporter
      (having its own SSRC identifier, signaled to the HNEDs in a DVB
      IPTV specific way) , which represents the Retransmission Server in
      its role as primary RTP_Rx.  Alternatively the RTCP FF message is
      transmitted by the RS acting as RTP translator when the RS assumes
      a packet loss event took place that is impacting many HNEDs, but
      not the RS (as RTP_Rx) itself.

   o  This RTCP FF message may be sent in the primary RTP SSM but may
      also be sent in a dedicated RTP SSM sourced by the Retransmission
      Server.

   o  In order to better control and allow the Retransmission Server to
      better recognize potential feedback implosion situations, an

      optional feature has been defined.  A subset of RTP_Rx can act as
      immediate reporters (which do not follow the dithering
      transmission timing rules from [RFC4585]), and will send an RTCP
      NACK message immediately upon packet loss detection.  Whether an
      HNED acts as immediate reporter or not is determined by whether
      its randomly chosen SSRC identifier value maps to a pre-defined
      SSRC mask/pattern that is signaled to all HNEDs.
