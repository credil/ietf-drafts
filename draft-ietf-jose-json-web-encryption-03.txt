Internet-Draft                     JWE                         July 2012


1.  Introduction

   JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is a compact encryption format intended for
   space constrained environments such as HTTP Authorization headers and
   URI query parameters.  It represents this content using JavaScript
   Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] data structures.  The JWE
   cryptographic mechanisms encrypt and provide integrity protection for
   arbitrary sequences of bytes.

   Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this
   specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)
   [JWA] specification.  Related digital signature and MAC capabilities
   are described in the separate JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS]
   specification.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   JSON Web Encryption (JWE)  A data structure representing an encrypted
      message.  The structure consists of four parts: the JWE Header,
      the JWE Encrypted Key, the JWE Ciphertext, and the JWE Integrity
      Value.

   Plaintext  The bytes to be encrypted - a.k.a., the message.  The
      plaintext can contain an arbitrary sequence of bytes.

   Ciphertext  An encrypted representation of the Plaintext.

   Content Encryption Key (CEK)  A symmetric key used to encrypt the
      Plaintext for the recipient to produce the Ciphertext.

   Content Integrity Key (CIK)  A key used with a MAC function to ensure
      the integrity of the Ciphertext and the parameters used to create
      it.

   Content Master Key (CMK)  A key from which the CEK and CIK are
      derived.  When key wrapping or key encryption are employed, the
      CMK is randomly generated and encrypted to the recipient as the
      JWE Encrypted Key. When key agreement is employed, the CMK is the
      result of the key agreement algorithm.

Internet-Draft                     JWE                         July 2012


   JWE Header  A string representing a JSON object that describes the
      encryption operations applied to create the JWE Encrypted Key, the
      JWE Ciphertext, and the JWE Integrity Value.

   JWE Encrypted Key  When key wrapping or key encryption are employed,
      the Content Master Key (CMK) is encrypted with the intended
      recipient's key and the resulting encrypted content is recorded as
      a byte array, which is referred to as the JWE Encrypted Key.
      Otherwise, when key agreement is employed, the JWE Encrypted Key
      is the empty byte array.

   JWE Ciphertext  A byte array containing the Ciphertext.

   JWE Integrity Value  A byte array containing a MAC value that ensures
      the integrity of the Ciphertext and the parameters used to create
      it.

   Encoded JWE Header  Base64url encoding of the bytes of the UTF-8
      [RFC3629] representation of the JWE Header.

   Encoded JWE Encrypted Key  Base64url encoding of the JWE Encrypted
      Key.

   Encoded JWE Ciphertext  Base64url encoding of the JWE Ciphertext.

   Encoded JWE Integrity Value  Base64url encoding of the JWE Integrity
      Value.

   Header Parameter Name  The name of a member of the JSON object
      representing a JWE Header.

   Header Parameter Value  The value of a member of the JSON object
      representing a JWE Header.

   JWE Compact Serialization  A representation of the JWE as the
      concatenation of the Encoded JWE Header, the Encoded JWE Encrypted
      Key, the Encoded JWE Ciphertext, and the Encoded JWE Integrity
      Value in that order, with the four strings being separated by
      period ('.') characters.

   AEAD Algorithm  An Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
      (AEAD) [RFC5116] encryption algorithm is one that provides an
      integrated content integrity check.  AES Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
      is one such algorithm.

   Base64url Encoding  For the purposes of this specification, this term
      always refers to the URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding
      described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], Section 5, with the (non URL-
      safe) '=' padding characters omitted, as permitted by Section 3.2.
      (See Appendix C of [JWS] for notes on implementing base64url
      encoding without padding.)

   Collision Resistant Namespace  A namespace that allows names to be
      allocated in a manner such that they are highly unlikely to
      collide with other names.  For instance, collision resistance can
      be achieved through administrative delegation of portions of the
      namespace or through use of collision-resistant name allocation
      functions.  Examples of Collision Resistant Namespaces include:
      Domain Names, Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined in the ITU-T
      X.660 and X.670 Recommendation series, and Universally Unique
      IDentifiers (UUIDs) [RFC4122].  When using an administratively
      delegated namespace, the definer of a name needs to take
      reasonable precautions to ensure they are in control of the
      portion of the namespace they use to define the name.

   StringOrURI  A JSON string value, with the additional requirement
      that while arbitrary string values MAY be used, any value
      containing a ":" character MUST be a URI [RFC3986].


3.  JSON Web Encryption (JWE) Overview

   JWE represents encrypted content using JSON data structures and
   base64url encoding.  The representation consists of four parts: the
   JWE Header, the JWE Encrypted Key, the JWE Ciphertext, and the JWE
   Integrity Value.  In the Compact Serialization, the four parts are
   base64url-encoded for transmission, and represented as the
   concatenation of the encoded strings in that order, with the four
   strings being separated by period ('.') characters.  (A JSON
   Serialization for this information is defined in the separate JSON
   Web Encryption JSON Serialization (JWE-JS) [JWE-JS] specification.)

   JWE utilizes encryption to ensure the confidentiality of the
   Plaintext.  JWE adds a content integrity check if not provided by the
   underlying encryption algorithm.

3.1.  Example JWE with an Integrated Integrity Check

   This example encrypts the plaintext "Live long and prosper." to the
   recipient using RSAES OAEP and AES GCM.  The AES GCM algorithm has an
   integrated integrity check.

   The following example JWE Header declares that:

Internet-Draft                     JWE                         July 2012


   o  the Content Master Key is encrypted to the recipient using the
      RSAES OAEP algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key,

   o  the Plaintext is encrypted using the AES GCM algorithm with a 256
      bit key to produce the Ciphertext, and

   o  the 96 bit Initialization Vector (IV) with the base64url encoding
      "48V1_ALb6US04U3b" was used.

   {"alg":"RSA-OAEP","enc":"A256GCM","iv":"48V1_ALb6US04U3b"}

   Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWE
   Header yields this Encoded JWE Header value (with line breaks for
   display purposes only):

   NlVTMDRVM2IifQ

   The remaining steps to finish creating this JWE are:

   o  Generate a random Content Master Key (CMK)

   o  Encrypt the CMK with the recipient's public key using the RSAES
      OAEP algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key

   o  Base64url encode the JWE Encrypted Key to produce the Encoded JWE
      Encrypted Key

   o  Concatenate the Encoded JWE Header value, a period character
      ('.'), and the Encoded JWE Encrypted Key to create the "additional
      authenticated data" parameter for the AES GCM algorithm.

   o  Encrypt the Plaintext with AES GCM, using the IV, the CMK as the
      encryption key, and the "additional authenticated data" value
      above, requesting a 128 bit "authentication tag" output

   o  Base64url encode the resulting Ciphertext to create the Encoded
      JWE Ciphertext

   o  Base64url encode the resulting "authentication tag" to create the
      Encoded JWE Integrity Value

   o  Assemble the final representation: The Compact Serialization of
      this result is the concatenation of the Encoded JWE Header, the
      Encoded JWE Encrypted Key, the Encoded JWE Ciphertext, and the
      Encoded JWE Integrity Value in that order, with the four strings
      being separated by three period ('.') characters.

   The final result in this example (with line breaks for display

   See Appendix A.1 for the complete details of computing this JWE.

3.2.  Example JWE with a Separate Integrity Check

   This example encrypts the plaintext "Now is the time for all good men
   to come to the aid of their country." to the recipient using RSAES-
   PKCS1-V1_5 and AES CBC.  AES CBC does not have an integrated
   integrity check, so a separate integrity check calculation is
   performed using HMAC SHA-256, with separate encryption and integrity
   keys being derived from a master key using the Concat KDF with the
   SHA-256 digest function.

   The following example JWE Header (with line breaks for display
   purposes only) declares that:

   o  the Content Master Key is encrypted to the recipient using the
      RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5 algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key,

   o  the Plaintext is encrypted using the AES CBC algorithm with a 128
      bit key to produce the Ciphertext,

   o  the JWE Integrity Value safeguarding the integrity of the
      Ciphertext and the parameters used to create it was computed with
      the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm, and

   o  the 128 bit Initialization Vector (IV) with the base64url encoding
      "AxY8DCtDaGlsbGljb3RoZQ" was used.

   {"alg":"RSA1_5","enc":"A128CBC","int":"HS256","iv":"AxY8DCtDaGls
   bGljb3RoZQ"}

   Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWE
   Header yields this Encoded JWE Header value (with line breaks for
   display purposes only):

Internet-Draft                     JWE                         July 2012


   The remaining steps to finish creating this JWE are like the previous
   example, but with an additional step to compute the separate
   integrity value:

   o  Generate a random Content Master Key (CMK)

   o  Encrypt the CMK with the recipient's public key using the RSAES-
      PKCS1-V1_5 algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key

   o  Base64url encode the JWE Encrypted Key to produce the Encoded JWE
      Encrypted Key

   o  Use the Concat key derivation function to derive Content
      Encryption Key (CEK) and Content Integrity Key (CIK) values from
      the CMK

   o  Encrypt the Plaintext with AES CBC using the CEK and IV to produce
      the Ciphertext

   o  Base64url encode the resulting Ciphertext to create the Encoded
      JWE Ciphertext

   o  Concatenate the Encoded JWE Header value, a period character
      ('.'), the Encoded JWE Encrypted Key, a second period character,
      and the Encoded JWE Ciphertext to create the value to integrity
      protect

   o  Compute the HMAC SHA-256 of this value using the CIK to create the
      JWE Integrity Value

   o  Base64url encode the resulting JWE Integrity Value to create the
      Encoded JWE Integrity Value

   o  Assemble the final representation: The Compact Serialization of
      this result is the concatenation of the Encoded JWE Header, the
      Encoded JWE Encrypted Key, the Encoded JWE Ciphertext, and the
      Encoded JWE Integrity Value in that order, with the four strings
      being separated by three period ('.') characters.

   The final result in this example (with line breaks for display
   purposes only) is:

4.  JWE Header

   The members of the JSON object represented by the JWE Header describe
   the encryption applied to the Plaintext and optionally additional
   properties of the JWE.  The Header Parameter Names within this object
   MUST be unique; JWEs with duplicate Header Parameter Names MUST be
   rejected.  Implementations MUST understand the entire contents of the
   header; otherwise, the JWE MUST be rejected.

   There are two ways of distinguishing whether a header is a JWS Header
   or a JWE Header.  The first is by examining the "alg" (algorithm)
   header value.  If the value represents a digital signature or MAC
   algorithm, or is the value "none", it is for a JWS; if it represents
   an encryption or key agreement algorithm, it is for a JWE.  A second
   method is determining whether an "enc" (encryption method) member
   exists.  If the "enc" member exists, it is a JWE; otherwise, it is a
   JWS.  Both methods will yield the same result.

   There are three classes of Header Parameter Names: Reserved Header
   Parameter Names, Public Header Parameter Names, and Private Header
   Parameter Names.

4.1.  Reserved Header Parameter Names

   The following header parameter names are reserved with meanings as
   defined below.  All the names are short because a core goal of JWE is
   for the representations to be compact.

   Additional reserved header parameter names MAY be defined via the
   IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters registry
   [JWS].  As indicated by the common registry, JWSs and JWEs share a
   common header parameter space; when a parameter is used by both
   specifications, its usage must be compatible between the

   specifications.

4.1.1.  "alg" (Algorithm) Header Parameter

   The "alg" (algorithm) header parameter identifies the cryptographic
   algorithm used to encrypt or reach agreement upon the Content Master
   Key (CMK).  The algorithm specified by the "alg" value MUST be
   supported by the implementation and there MUST be a key for use with
   that algorithm associated with the intended recipient or the JWE MUST
   be rejected.  The "alg" value is case sensitive.  Its value MUST be a
   string containing a StringOrURI value.  This header parameter is
   REQUIRED.

   A list of defined "alg" values for use with JWE is presented in
   Section 4.1 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification.
   "alg" values SHOULD either be registered in the IANA JSON Web
   Signature and Encryption Algorithms registry [JWA] or be a URI that
   contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.

4.1.2.  "enc" (Encryption Method) Header Parameter

   The "enc" (encryption method) header parameter identifies the
   symmetric encryption algorithm used to encrypt the Plaintext to
   produce the Ciphertext.  The algorithm specified by the "enc" value
   MUST be supported by the implementation or the JWE MUST be rejected.
   The "enc" value is case sensitive.  Its value MUST be a string
   containing a StringOrURI value.  This header parameter is REQUIRED.

   A list of defined "enc" values is presented in Section 4.2 of the
   JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification. "enc" values SHOULD
   either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption
   Algorithms registry [JWA] or be a URI that contains a Collision
   Resistant Namespace.

4.1.3.  "int" (Integrity Algorithm) Header Parameter

   The "int" (integrity algorithm) header parameter identifies the
   cryptographic algorithm used to safeguard the integrity of the
   Ciphertext and the parameters used to create it.  The "int" parameter
   uses the MAC subset of the algorithm values used by the JWS "alg"
   parameter.  The "int" value is case sensitive.  Its value MUST be a
   string containing a StringOrURI value.  This header parameter is
   REQUIRED when an AEAD algorithm is not used to encrypt the Plaintext
   and MUST NOT be present when an AEAD algorithm is used.

   A list of defined "int" values is presented in Section 4.3 of the
   JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification. "int" values SHOULD
   either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption

   Algorithms registry [JWA] or be a URI that contains a Collision
   Resistant Namespace.

4.1.4.  "kdf" (Key Derivation Function) Header Parameter

   The "kdf" (key derivation function) header parameter identifies the
   cryptographic algorithm used to derive the CEK and CIK from the CMK.
   The "kdf" value is case sensitive.  Its value MUST be a string
   containing a StringOrURI value.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL
   when an AEAD algorithm is not used to encrypt the Plaintext and MUST
   NOT be present when an AEAD algorithm is used.

   When an AEAD algorithm is not used and no "kdf" header parameter is
   present, the "CS256" KDF [JWA] SHALL be used.

   A list of defined "kdf" values is presented in Section 4.4 of the
   JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification. "kdf" values SHOULD
   either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption
   Algorithms registry [JWA] or be a URI that contains a Collision
   Resistant Namespace.

4.1.5.  "iv" (Initialization Vector) Header Parameter

   The "iv" (initialization vector) value for algorithms requiring it,
   represented as a base64url encoded string.  This header parameter is
   OPTIONAL, although its use is REQUIRED with some "enc" algorithms.

4.1.6.  "epk" (Ephemeral Public Key) Header Parameter

   The "epk" (ephemeral public key) value created by the originator for
   the use in key agreement algorithms.  This key is represented as a
   JSON Web Key [JWK] value.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL,
   although its use is REQUIRED with some "alg" algorithms.

4.1.7.  "zip" (Compression Algorithm) Header Parameter

   The "zip" (compression algorithm) applied to the Plaintext before
   encryption, if any.  If present, the value of the "zip" header
   parameter MUST be the case sensitive string "DEF".  Compression is
   performed with the DEFLATE [RFC1951] algorithm.  If no "zip"
   parameter is present, no compression is applied to the Plaintext
   before encryption.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL.

4.1.8.  "jku" (JWK Set URL) Header Parameter

   The "jku" (JWK Set URL) header parameter is a URI [RFC3986] that
   refers to a resource for a set of JSON-encoded public keys, one of
   which corresponds to the key used to encrypt the JWE; this can be

   used to determine the private key needed to decrypt the JWE.  The
   keys MUST be encoded as a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) [JWK].  The
   protocol used to acquire the resource MUST provide integrity
   protection; an HTTP GET request to retrieve the certificate MUST use
   TLS [RFC2818] [RFC5246]; the identity of the server MUST be
   validated, as per Section 3.1 of HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818].  This
   header parameter is OPTIONAL.

4.1.9.  "jwk" (JSON Web Key) Header Parameter

   The "jwk" (JSON Web Key) header parameter is a public key that
   corresponds to the key used to encrypt the JWE; this can be used to
   determine the private key needed to decrypt the JWE.  This key is
   represented as a JSON Web Key [JWK].  This header parameter is
   OPTIONAL.

4.1.10.  "x5u" (X.509 URL) Header Parameter

   The "x5u" (X.509 URL) header parameter is a URI [RFC3986] that refers
   to a resource for the X.509 public key certificate or certificate
   chain [RFC5280] corresponding to the key used to encrypt the JWE;
   this can be used to determine the private key needed to decrypt the
   JWE.  The identified resource MUST provide a representation of the
   certificate or certificate chain that conforms to RFC 5280 [RFC5280]
   in PEM encoded form [RFC1421].  The certificate containing the public
   key of the entity that encrypted the JWE MUST be the first
   certificate.  This MAY be followed by additional certificates, with
   each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the
   previous one.  The protocol used to acquire the resource MUST provide
   integrity protection; an HTTP GET request to retrieve the certificate
   MUST use TLS [RFC2818] [RFC5246]; the identity of the server MUST be
   validated, as per Section 3.1 of HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818].  This
   header parameter is OPTIONAL.

4.1.11.  "x5t" (X.509 Certificate Thumbprint) Header Parameter

   The "x5t" (X.509 Certificate Thumbprint) header parameter provides a
   base64url encoded SHA-1 thumbprint (a.k.a. digest) of the DER
   encoding of the X.509 certificate [RFC5280] corresponding to the key
   used to encrypt the JWE; this can be used to determine the private
   key needed to decrypt the JWE.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL.

   If, in the future, certificate thumbprints need to be computed using
   hash functions other than SHA-1, it is suggested that additional
   related header parameters be defined for that purpose.  For example,
   it is suggested that a new "x5t#S256" (X.509 Certificate Thumbprint
   using SHA-256) header parameter could be defined by registering it in
   the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters registry

   [JWS].

4.1.12.  "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Header Parameter

   The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) header parameter contains the
   X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain [RFC5280]
   corresponding to the key used to encrypt the JWE; this can be used to
   determine the private key needed to decrypt the JWE.  The certificate
   or certificate chain is represented as an array of certificate
   values.  Each value is a base64 encoded ([RFC4648] Section 4 - not
   base64url encoded) DER [ITU.X690.1994] PKIX certificate value.  The
   certificate containing the public key of the entity that encrypted
   the JWE MUST be the first certificate.  This MAY be followed by
   additional certificates, with each subsequent certificate being the
   one used to certify the previous one.  The recipient MUST verify the
   certificate chain according to [RFC5280] and reject the JWE if any
   validation failure occurs.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL.

   See Appendix B of [JWS] for an example "x5c" value.

4.1.13.  "kid" (Key ID) Header Parameter

   The "kid" (key ID) header parameter is a hint indicating which key
   was used to encrypt the JWE; this can be used to determine the
   private key needed to decrypt the JWE.  This parameter allows
   originators to explicitly signal a change of key to recipients.
   Should the recipient be unable to locate a key corresponding to the
   "kid" value, they SHOULD treat that condition as an error.  The
   interpretation of the "kid" value is unspecified.  Its value MUST be
   a string.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL.

   When used with a JWK, the "kid" value MAY be used to match a JWK
   "kid" parameter value.

4.1.14.  "typ" (Type) Header Parameter

   The "typ" (type) header parameter is used to declare the type of this
   object.  The type value "JWE" MAY be used to indicate that this
   object is a JWE.  The "typ" value is case sensitive.  Its value MUST
   be a string.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL.

   MIME Media Type [RFC2046] values MAY be used as "typ" values.

   "typ" values SHOULD either be registered in the IANA JSON Web
   Signature and Encryption Type Values registry [JWS] or be a URI that
   contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.

Internet-Draft                     JWE                         July 2012


4.1.15.  "cty" (Content Type) Header Parameter

   The "cty" (content type) header parameter is used to declare the type
   of the encrypted content (the Plaintext).  The "cty" value is case
   sensitive.  Its value MUST be a string.  This header parameter is
   OPTIONAL.

   The values used for the "cty" header parameter come from the same
   value space as the "typ" header parameter, with the same rules
   applying.

4.2.  Public Header Parameter Names

   Additional header parameter names can be defined by those using JWEs.
   However, in order to prevent collisions, any new header parameter
   name SHOULD either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Signature and
   Encryption Header Parameters registry [JWS] or be a URI that contains
   a Collision Resistant Namespace.  In each case, the definer of the
   name or value needs to take reasonable precautions to make sure they
   are in control of the part of the namespace they use to define the
   header parameter name.

   New header parameters should be introduced sparingly, as they can
   result in non-interoperable JWEs.

4.3.  Private Header Parameter Names

   A producer and consumer of a JWE may agree to any header parameter
   name that is not a Reserved Name Section 4.1 or a Public Name
   Section 4.2.  Unlike Public Names, these private names are subject to
   collision and should be used with caution.


5.  Message Encryption

   The message encryption process is as follows.  The order of the steps
   is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between
   the inputs and outputs of the steps.

   1.   When key wrapping or key encryption are employed, generate a
        random Content Master Key (CMK).  See RFC 4086 [RFC4086] for
        considerations on generating random values.  Otherwise, when key
        agreement is employed, use the key agreement algorithm to
        compute the value of the Content Master Key (CMK).  The CMK MUST
        have a length equal to that of the larger of the required
        encryption and integrity keys.

Internet-Draft                     JWE                         July 2012


   2.   When key wrapping or key encryption are employed, encrypt the
        CMK for the recipient (see Section 7) and let the result be the
        JWE Encrypted Key. Otherwise, when key agreement is employed,
        let the JWE Encrypted Key be an empty byte array.

   3.   Base64url encode the JWE Encrypted Key to create the Encoded JWE
        Encrypted Key.

   4.   Generate a random Initialization Vector (IV) of the correct size
        for the algorithm (if required for the algorithm).

   5.   If not using an AEAD algorithm, run the key derivation algorithm
        specified by the "kdf" header parameter to generate the Content
        Encryption Key (CEK) and the Content Integrity Key (CIK);
        otherwise (when using an AEAD algorithm), set the CEK to be the
        CMK.

   6.   Compress the Plaintext if a "zip" parameter was included.

   7.   Serialize the (compressed) Plaintext into a byte sequence M.

   8.   Create a JWE Header containing the encryption parameters used.
        Note that white space is explicitly allowed in the
        representation and no canonicalization need be performed before
        encoding.

   9.   Base64url encode the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the
        JWE Header to create the Encoded JWE Header.

   10.  Encrypt M using the CEK and IV to form the byte sequence C. If
        an AEAD algorithm is used, use the bytes of the ASCII
        representation of the concatenation of the Encoded JWE Header, a
        period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWE Encrypted Key as the
        "additional authenticated data" parameter value for the
        encryption.

   11.  Base64url encode C to create the Encoded JWE Ciphertext.

   12.  If not using an AEAD algorithm, run the integrity algorithm (see
        Section 8) using the CIK to compute the JWE Integrity Value;
        otherwise (when using an AEAD algorithm), set the JWE Integrity
        Value to be the "authentication tag" value produced by the AEAD
        algorithm.

   13.  Base64url encode the JWE Integrity Value to create the Encoded
        JWE Integrity Value.

   14.  The four encoded parts, taken together, are the result.

   15.  The Compact Serialization of this result is the concatenation of
        the Encoded JWE Header, the Encoded JWE Encrypted Key, the
        Encoded JWE Ciphertext, and the Encoded JWE Integrity Value in
        that order, with the four strings being separated by period
        ('.') characters.


6.  Message Decryption

   The message decryption process is the reverse of the encryption
   process.  The order of the steps is not significant in cases where
   there are no dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the
   steps.  If any of these steps fails, the JWE MUST be rejected.

   1.   Determine the Encoded JWE Header, the Encoded JWE Encrypted Key,
        the Encoded JWE Ciphertext, and the Encoded JWE Integrity Value
        values contained in the JWE.  When using the Compact
        Serialization, these four values are represented in that order,
        separated by period characters.

   2.   The Encoded JWE Header, the Encoded JWE Encrypted Key, the
        Encoded JWE Ciphertext, and the Encoded JWE Integrity Value MUST
        be successfully base64url decoded following the restriction that
        no padding characters have been used.

   3.   The resulting JWE Header MUST be completely valid JSON syntax
        conforming to RFC 4627 [RFC4627].

   4.   The resulting JWE Header MUST be validated to only include
        parameters and values whose syntax and semantics are both
        understood and supported.

   5.   Verify that the JWE Header references a key known to the
        recipient.

   6.   When key wrapping or key encryption are employed, decrypt the
        JWE Encrypted Key to produce the Content Master Key (CMK).
        Otherwise, when key agreement is employed, use the key agreement
        algorithm to compute the value of the Content Master Key (CMK).
        The CMK MUST have a length equal to that of the larger of the
        required encryption and integrity keys.

   7.   If not using an AEAD algorithm, run the key derivation algorithm
        specified by the "kdf" header parameter to generate the Content
        Encryption Key (CEK) and the Content Integrity Key (CIK);
        otherwise (when using an AEAD algorithm), set the CEK to be the

        CMK.

   8.   Decrypt the binary representation of the JWE Ciphertext using
        the CEK and IV.  If an AEAD algorithm is used, use the bytes of
        the ASCII representation of the concatenation of the Encoded JWE
        Header, a period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWE Encrypted
        Key as the "additional authenticated data" parameter value for
        the decryption.

   9.   If not using an AEAD algorithm, run the integrity algorithm (see
        Section 8) using the CIK to compute an integrity value for the
        input received.  This computed value MUST match the received JWE
        Integrity Value; otherwise (when using an AEAD algorithm), the
        received JWE Integrity Value MUST match the "authentication tag"
        value produced by the AEAD algorithm.

   10.  Uncompress the result of the previous step, if a "zip" parameter
        was included.

   11.  Output the resulting Plaintext.


7.  CMK Encryption

   JWE supports two forms of Content Master Key (CMK) encryption:

   o  Asymmetric encryption under the recipient's public key.

   o  Symmetric encryption under a key shared between the sender and
      receiver.

   See the algorithms registered for "enc" usage in the IANA JSON Web
   Signature and Encryption Algorithms registry [JWA] and Section 4.1 of
   the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification for lists of
   encryption algorithms that can be used for CMK encryption.


8.  Integrity Value Calculation

   When a non-AEAD algorithm is used (an algorithm without an integrated
   content check), JWE adds an explicit integrity check value to the
   representation.  This value is computed in the manner described in
   the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] specification, with these
   modifications:

   o  The algorithm used is taken from the "int" (integrity algorithm)

   o  The algorithm MUST be a MAC algorithm (such as HMAC SHA-256).

   o  The JWS Secured Input used is the bytes of the ASCII
      representation of the concatenation of the Encoded JWE Header, a
      period ('.') character, the Encoded JWE Encrypted Key, a period
      ('.') character, and the Encoded JWE Ciphertext.

   o  The CIK is used as the MAC key.

   The computed JWS Signature value is the resulting integrity value.


9.  Encrypting JWEs with Cryptographic Algorithms

   JWE uses cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the Plaintext and the
   Content Encryption Key (CMK) and to provide integrity protection for
   the JWE Header, JWE Encrypted Key, and JWE Ciphertext.  The JSON Web
   Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification specifies a set of cryptographic
   algorithms and identifiers to be used with this specification and
   defines registries for additional such algorithms.  Specifically,
   Section 4.1 specifies a set of "alg" (algorithm) header parameter
   values, Section 4.2 specifies a set of "enc" (encryption method)
   header parameter values, Section 4.3 specifies a set of "int"
   (integrity algorithm) header parameter values, and Section 4.4
   specifies a set of "kdf" (key derivation function) header parameter
   values intended for use this specification.  It also describes the
   semantics and operations that are specific to these algorithms and
   algorithm families.

   Public keys employed for encryption can be identified using the
   Header Parameter methods described in Section 4.1 or can be
   distributed using methods that are outside the scope of this
   specification.

11.  Security Considerations

   All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
   must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
   protecting the user's private key, preventing various attacks, and
   helping the user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently encrypting a
   message for the wrong recipient.  The entire list of security
   considerations is beyond the scope of this document, but some
   significant concerns are listed here.

   All the security considerations in the JWS specification also apply
   to this specification.  Likewise, all the security considerations in
   XML Encryption 1.1 [W3C.CR-xmlenc-core1-20120313] also apply to JWE,
   other than those that are XML specific.


12.  Open Issues

   [[ to be removed by the RFC editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   The following items remain to be considered or done in this draft:

   o  Should we define an optional nonce and/or timestamp header
      parameter?  (Use of a nonce is an effective countermeasure to some
      kinds of attacks.)

   o  When doing key agreement, do we want to also use a separate CMK
      and encrypt the CMK with the agreed upon key or just use the
      agreed upon key directly as the CMK?  Having a CMK would have
      value in the multiple recipients case, as it would allow multiple
      recipients to share the same ciphertext even when key agreement is
      used, but it seems that it's just extra overhead in the single
      recipient case.

   o  Do we want to consolidate the combination of the "enc", "int", and
      "kdf" parameters into a single new "enc" parameter defining
      composite AEAD algorithms?  For instance, we might define a
      composite algorithm A128CBC with HS256 and CS256 and another
      composite algorithm A256CBC with HS512 and CS512.  A symmetry
      argument for doing this is that the "int" and "kdf" parameters are
      not used with AEAD algorithms.  An argument against it is that in
      some cases, integrity is not needed because it's provided by other
      means, and so having the flexibility to not use an "int" algorithm

      or key derivation with a non-AEAD "enc" algorithm could be useful.

Appendix A.  JWE Examples

   This section provides examples of JWE computations.

A.1.  Example JWE using RSAES OAEP and AES GCM

   This example encrypts the plaintext "Live long and prosper." to the
   recipient using RSAES OAEP and AES GCM.  The AES GCM algorithm has an
   integrated integrity check.  The representation of this plaintext is:

   [76, 105, 118, 101, 32, 108, 111, 110, 103, 32, 97, 110, 100, 32,
   112, 114, 111, 115, 112, 101, 114, 46]

A.1.1.  JWE Header

   The following example JWE Header declares that:

   o  the Content Master Key is encrypted to the recipient using the
      RSAES OAEP algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key,

   o  the Plaintext is encrypted using the AES GCM algorithm with a 256
      bit key to produce the Ciphertext, and

   o  the 96 bit Initialization Vector (IV) [227, 197, 117, 252, 2, 219,
      233, 68, 180, 225, 77, 219] with the base64url encoding
      "48V1_ALb6US04U3b" was used.

   {"alg":"RSA-OAEP","enc":"A256GCM","iv":"48V1_ALb6US04U3b"}

A.1.2.  Encoded JWE Header

   Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWE
   Header yields this Encoded JWE Header value (with line breaks for
   display purposes only):

   Generate a random Content Master Key (CMK).  In this example, the key
   value is:

A.1.11.  Validation

   This example illustrates the process of creating a JWE with an AEAD
   algorithm.  These results can be used to validate JWE decryption
   implementations for these algorithms.  However, note that since the
   RSAES OAEP computation includes random values, the results above will
   not be repeatable.

A.2.  Example JWE using RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5 and AES CBC

   This example encrypts the plaintext "Now is the time for all good men
   to come to the aid of their country." to the recipient using RSAES-
   PKCS1-V1_5 and AES CBC.  AES CBC does not have an integrated
   integrity check, so a separate integrity check calculation is
   performed using HMAC SHA-256, with separate encryption and integrity
   keys being derived from a master key using the Concat KDF with the
   SHA-256 digest function.  The representation of this plaintext is:

   [78, 111, 119, 32, 105, 115, 32, 116, 104, 101, 32, 116, 105, 109,

A.2.1.  JWE Header

   The following example JWE Header (with line breaks for display
   purposes only) declares that:

   o  the Content Master Key is encrypted to the recipient using the
      RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5 algorithm to produce the JWE Encrypted Key,

   o  the Plaintext is encrypted using the AES CBC algorithm with a 128
      bit key to produce the Ciphertext,

   o  the JWE Integrity Value safeguarding the integrity of the
      Ciphertext and the parameters used to create it was computed with

   Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWE
   Header yields this Encoded JWE Header value (with line breaks for
   display purposes only):

   implementations for these algorithms.  Since all the algorithms used
   in this example produce deterministic results, the results above
   should be repeatable.

A.3.  Example Key Derivation with Outputs <= Hash Size

   This example uses the Concat KDF to derive the Content Encryption Key
   (CEK) and Content Integrity Key (CIK) from the Content Master Key
   (CMK) in the manner described in Section 4.12 of [JWA].  In this
   example, a 256 bit CMK is used to derive a 128 bit CEK and a 256 bit
   CIK.

   The CMK value is:

   [4, 211, 31, 197, 84, 157, 252, 254, 11, 100, 157, 250, 63, 170, 106,
   206, 107, 124, 212, 45, 111, 107, 9, 219, 200, 177, 0, 240, 143, 156,
   44, 207]

A.3.1.  CEK Generation

   When deriving the CEK from the CMK, the ASCII label "Encryption"
   ([69, 110, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 105, 111, 110]) is used.  The
   input to the first hash round is the concatenation of the big endian
   number 1 ([0, 0, 0, 1]), the CMK, and the label.  Thus the round 1
   hash input is:

   [0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 211, 31, 197, 84, 157, 252, 254, 11, 100, 157, 250,
   63, 170, 106, 206, 107, 124, 212, 45, 111, 107, 9, 219, 200, 177, 0,
   240, 143, 156, 44, 207, 69, 110, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 105, 111,
   110]

   The SHA-256 hash of this value, which is the round 1 hash output, is:

   [249, 255, 87, 218, 224, 223, 221, 53, 204, 121, 166, 130, 195, 184,
   50, 69, 11, 237, 202, 71, 10, 96, 59, 199, 140, 88, 126, 147, 146,
   113, 222, 41]

   Given that 128 bits are needed for the CEK and the hash has produced
   256 bits, the CEK value is the first 128 bits of that value:

   [249, 255, 87, 218, 224, 223, 221, 53, 204, 121, 166, 130, 195, 184,
   50, 69]

A.3.2.  CIK Generation

   When deriving the CIK from the CMK, the ASCII label "Integrity" ([73,
   110, 116, 101, 103, 114, 105, 116, 121]) is used.  The input to the
   first hash round is the concatenation of the big endian number 1 ([0,

   0, 0, 1]), the CMK, and the label.  Thus the round 1 hash input is:

   [0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 211, 31, 197, 84, 157, 252, 254, 11, 100, 157, 250,
   63, 170, 106, 206, 107, 124, 212, 45, 111, 107, 9, 219, 200, 177, 0,
   240, 143, 156, 44, 207, 73, 110, 116, 101, 103, 114, 105, 116, 121]

   The SHA-256 hash of this value, which is the round 1 hash output, is:

   [218, 209, 130, 50, 169, 45, 70, 214, 29, 187, 123, 20, 3, 158, 111,
   122, 182, 94, 57, 133, 245, 76, 97, 44, 193, 80, 81, 246, 115, 177,
   225, 159]

   Given that 256 bits are needed for the CIK and the hash has produced
   256 bits, the CIK value is that same value:

   [218, 209, 130, 50, 169, 45, 70, 214, 29, 187, 123, 20, 3, 158, 111,
   122, 182, 94, 57, 133, 245, 76, 97, 44, 193, 80, 81, 246, 115, 177,
   225, 159]

A.4.  Example Key Derivation with Outputs >= Hash Size

   This example uses the Concat KDF to derive the Content Encryption Key
   (CEK) and Content Integrity Key (CIK) from the Content Master Key
   (CMK) in the manner described in Section 4.12 of [JWA].  In this
   example, a 512 bit CMK is used to derive a 256 bit CEK and a 512 bit
   CIK.

   The CMK value is:

   [148, 116, 199, 126, 2, 117, 233, 76, 150, 149, 89, 193, 61, 34, 239,
   226, 109, 71, 59, 160, 192, 140, 150, 235, 106, 204, 49, 176, 68,
   119, 13, 34, 49, 19, 41, 69, 5, 20, 252, 145, 104, 129, 137, 138, 67,

   249, 7, 225, 168]

A.4.1.  CEK Generation

   When deriving the CEK from the CMK, the ASCII label "Encryption"
   ([69, 110, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 105, 111, 110]) is used.  The
   input to the first hash round is the concatenation of the big endian
   number 1 ([0, 0, 0, 1]), the CMK, and the label.  Thus the round 1
   hash input is:

   [0, 0, 0, 1, 148, 116, 199, 126, 2, 117, 233, 76, 150, 149, 89, 193,

   The SHA-256 hash of this value, which is the round 1 hash output, is:

   [137, 5, 92, 9, 17, 47, 17, 86, 253, 235, 34, 247, 121, 78, 11, 144,

   Given that 256 bits are needed for the CEK and the hash has produced
   256 bits, the CEK value is that same value:

A.4.2.  CIK Generation

   When deriving the CIK from the CMK, the ASCII label "Integrity" ([73,
   110, 116, 101, 103, 114, 105, 116, 121]) is used.  The input to the
   first hash round is the concatenation of the big endian number 1 ([0,
   0, 0, 1]), the CMK, and the label.  Thus the round 1 hash input is:

   [0, 0, 0, 1, 148, 116, 199, 126, 2, 117, 233, 76, 150, 149, 89, 193,

   176, 68, 119, 13, 34, 49, 19, 41, 69, 5, 20, 252, 145, 104, 129, 137,
   138, 67, 23, 153, 83, 81, 234, 82, 247, 48, 211, 41, 130, 35, 124,
   45, 156, 249, 7, 225, 168, 73, 110, 116, 101, 103, 114, 105, 116,
   121]

   The SHA-256 hash of this value, which is the round 1 hash output, is:

   [11, 179, 132, 177, 171, 24, 126, 19, 113, 1, 200, 102, 100, 74, 88,

   57, 17]

   Given that 512 bits are needed for the CIK and the hash has produced
   only 256 bits, another round is needed.  The input to the second hash
   round is the concatenation of the big endian number 2 ([0, 0, 0, 2]),
   the CMK, and the label.  Thus the round 2 hash input is:

   [0, 0, 0, 2, 148, 116, 199, 126, 2, 117, 233, 76, 150, 149, 89, 193,

      remains the Concat KDF with the SHA-256 digest function.

   o  Reordered encryption steps so that the Encoded JWE Header is
      always created before it is needed as an input to the AEAD
      "additional authenticated data" parameter.

Internet-Draft                     JWE                         July 2012


   o  Added the "cty" (content type) header parameter for declaring type
      information about the secured content, as opposed to the "typ"
      (type) header parameter, which declares type information about
      this object.

   o  Moved description of how to determine whether a header is for a
      JWS or a JWE from the JWT spec to the JWE spec.

   o  Added complete encryption examples for both AEAD and non-AEAD
      algorithms.

   o  Added complete key derivation examples.

   o  Added "Collision Resistant Namespace" to the terminology section.

   o  Reference ITU.X690.1994 for DER encoding.

   o  Added Registry Contents sections to populate registry values.

   o  Numerous editorial improvements.

   -02

   o  When using AEAD algorithms (such as AES GCM), use the "additional
      authenticated data" parameter to provide integrity for the header,
      encrypted key, and ciphertext and use the resulting
      "authentication tag" value as the JWE Integrity Value.

   o  Defined KDF output key sizes.

   o  Generalized text to allow key agreement to be employed as an
      alternative to key wrapping or key encryption.

   o  Changed compression algorithm from gzip to DEFLATE.

   o  Clarified that it is an error when a "kid" value is included and
      no matching key is found.

   o  Clarified that JWEs with duplicate Header Parameter Names MUST be
      rejected.

   o  Clarified the relationship between "typ" header parameter values
      and MIME types.

   o  Registered application/jwe MIME type and "JWE" typ header
      parameter value.

Internet-Draft                     JWE                         July 2012


   o  Simplified JWK terminology to get replace the "JWK Key Object" and
      "JWK Container Object" terms with simply "JSON Web Key (JWK)" and
      "JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set)" and to eliminate potential confusion
      between single keys and sets of keys.  As part of this change, the
      header parameter name for a public key value was changed from
      "jpk" (JSON Public Key) to "jwk" (JSON Web Key).

   o  Added suggestion on defining additional header parameters such as
      "x5t#S256" in the future for certificate thumbprints using hash
      algorithms other than SHA-1.

   o  Specify RFC 2818 server identity validation, rather than RFC 6125
      (paralleling the same decision in the OAuth specs).

   o  Generalized language to refer to Message Authentication Codes
      (MACs) rather than Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs)
      unless in a context specific to HMAC algorithms.

   o  Reformatted to give each header parameter its own section heading.

   -01

   o  Added an integrity check for non-AEAD algorithms.

   o  Added "jpk" and "x5c" header parameters for including JWK public
      keys and X.509 certificate chains directly in the header.

   o  Clarified that this specification is defining the JWE Compact
      Serialization.  Referenced the new JWE-JS spec, which defines the
      JWE JSON Serialization.

   o  Added text "New header parameters should be introduced sparingly
      since an implementation that does not understand a parameter MUST
      reject the JWE".

   o  Clarified that the order of the encryption and decryption steps is
      not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between
      the inputs and outputs of the steps.

   o  Made other editorial improvements suggested by JOSE working group
      participants.

   -00

   o  Created the initial IETF draft based upon
      draft-jones-json-web-encryption-02 with no normative changes.

Internet-Draft                     JWE                         July 2012


   o  Changed terminology to no longer call both digital signatures and
      HMACs "signatures".
