      <t>
   A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) router uses the Reverse 
   Path Forwarding (RPF) procedure to select an upstream interface
   and router to build forwarding state.  When there are equal
   cost multiple paths (ECMP), existing implementations
   often use hash algorithms to select a path. Such algorithms
   do not allow the spread of traffic among the ECMPs according
   to administrative metrics.  This usually leads to
   inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.
   This document introduces the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to
   improve the RPF procedure over ECMPs. It allows ECMP path
   selection to be based on administratively selected metrics,
   such as data transmission delays, path preferences and routing
   metrics.

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>A PIM router uses the RPF procedure to select an upstream
   interface and a PIM neighbor on that interface to build forwarding
   state.  When there are equal cost multiple paths (ECMP) upstream,
   existing implementations often use hash algorithms to select a
   path. Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic among the
   ECMP according to administrative metrics.  This usually leads to
   inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This document
   introduces the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF
   procedure over ECMP. It allows ECMP path selection to be based on
   administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays,
   path preferences and routing metrics, or a combination of metrics.</t>
      <t>ECMPs are frequently used in networks to provide
   redundancy and to increase available bandwidth. A PIM router
   selects a path in the ECMP based on its own implementation
   specific choice. The selection is a local decision. One
   way is to choose the PIM neighbor with the highest IP
   address, another is to pick the PIM neighbor with the
   best hash value over the destination and source addresses. </t>
      <t>While implementations supporting ECMP have been deployed widely,
   the existing RPF selection methods have weaknesses. The lack of
   administratively effective ways to allocate traffic over alternative
   paths is a major issue. For example, there is no straightforward way
   to tell two downstream routers to select either the same or
   different RPF neighbor routers for the same traffic flows.</t>
      <t>With the ECMP Redirect mechanism introduced here, the upstream
   routers use a PIM ECMP Redirect message to instruct the
   downstream routers on how to tie-break among the upstream
   neighbors.  The PIM ECMP Redirect message conveys the tie-break
   information based on metrics selected administratively.</t>
      <section title="Overview" toc="default">
        <t>The existing PIM Assert mechanism allows the upstream router
to detect the existence of multiple forwarders for the same
multicast flow onto the same downstream interface. The upstream
router sends a PIM Assert message containing a routing metric
for the downstream routers to use for tie-breaking among the
multiple upstream forwarders on the same RPF interface.</t>
        <t>With ECMP interfaces between the downstream and upstream routers,
the PIM ECMP Redirect mechanism works in a similar way, but extends
the ability to resolve the selection of forwarders among different
interfaces in the ECMP.</t>
        <t>When a PIM router downstream of the ECMP interfaces creates a new
(*,G) or (S,G) entry, it will populate the RPF interface and RPF
neighbor information according to the rules specified by
<xref target="RFC4601" pageno="false" format="default" />. 
This router will send its initial PIM Joins to that RPF neighbor.</t>
        <t>When the RPF neighbor router receives the Join message and finds that
the receiving interface is one of the ECMP interfaces, it will check
if the same flow is already being forwarded out of another ECMP
interface.  If so, this RPF neighbor router will send a PIM ECMP
Redirect message onto the interface the Join was received on. The PIM
ECMP Redirect message contains the address of the desired RPF neighbor, an
interface ID <xref target="RFC6395" pageno="false" format="default" />, along with other parameters used as 
tie breakers.  In essence, a PIM ECMP Redirect message is sent by an upstream 
router to notify downstream routers to redirect PIM Joins to the new RPF neighbor 
via a different interface.  When the downstream routers receive this message, 
they SHOULD trigger PIM Joins toward the new RPF neighbor specified in the 
packet.</t>
        <t>This PIM ECMP Redirect message has similar functions
        as the existing PIM Assert message, </t>
        
        <t>
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>It is sent by an upstream router; </t>
            <t>It is used to influence the  
                      RPF selection by downstream routers; </t>
            <t>A tie breaker metric is used. </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
However, the existing Assert message is used to select an upstream 
router within the same multi-access network (such as a LAN) while the 
Redirect message is used to select both a network and an upstream router.
                </t>
        <t>
One advantage of this design is that the control messages
are only sent when there is need to "re-balance" the traffic.
This reduces the amount of control traffic.
</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Applicability" toc="default">
        <t>The use of ECMP Redirect applies to shared trees or 
               source trees built with procedures described in 
               <xref target="RFC4601" pageno="false" format="default" />. 
               The use of ECMP Redirect in "Protocol Independent 
               Multicast - Dense Mode" <xref target="RFC3973" pageno="false" format="default" /> or 
               in "Bidirectional Protocol
               Independent Multicast" <xref target="RFC5015" pageno="false" format="default" /> is not      
               considered in this document.</t>
        <t> The enhancement described in this document can be applicable to a number
   of scenarios. For example, it allows a network operator to
   use ECMP paths and have the ability to perform load splitting
   based on bandwidth.  To do this, the downstream
   routers perform RPF selection with bandwidth instead of IP
   addresses as a tie breaker. The ECMP Redirect mechanism assures
   that all downstream routers select the desired network link
   and upstream router whenever possible.
   Another example is for a network operator to impose a
   transmission delay limit on certain links. The ECMP Redirect mechanism
   provides a means for an upstream router to instruct a downstream
   router to choose a different RPF path. </t>
        <t>This specification does not dictate the scope of applications
   of this mechanism.</t>

            <t>The upstream router is already forwarding 
      the same flow out of another interface belonging
                       to the same ECMP bundle; </t>
            <t>The upstream router is not forwarding the flow
       yet out any interfaces of the ECMP bundle,
       but there is another interface with more desired attributes.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>An upstream router MAY choose not to send 
    ECMP Redirects if it becomes aware that some of the 
    downstream routers are unreachable via some links in 
    ECMP bundle. </t>
        <t>An upstream router uses the "Neighbor Address" or the
   "Interface ID" field in the ECMP Redirect message to indicate the
   interface it wants traffic to be directed to. This Neighbor Address
   MUST be associated with an interface in the same ECMP bundle as the ECMP
   Redirect message's outgoing interface.  If the Interface ID field
   is ignored, this Neighbor Address field uniquely
   identifies a LAN and an upstream router to which a downstream
   router SHOULD redirect its Join messages, and an ECMP Redirect
   message MUST be discarded if the Neighbor Address field in the
   message does not match the cached neighbor address.
      </t>
      <t>The Interface ID field is used in IPv4 when one or more RPF
   neighbors in the ECMP bundle are unnumbered, or in IPv6 where link
   local addresses are in use.  For other IPv4 usage, this field is
   zero'ed when sent, and ignored when received.  If the "Router ID"
   part of the Interface ID is zero, the field MUST be ignored.  See
   [RFC6395] for details of its assignment and usage in PIM Hellos.
   If the Interface ID is not ignored, the receiving router of this
   message MUST use the Interface ID, instead of Neighbor Address,
   to identify the new RPF neighbor, and an ECMP Redirect message MUST
   be discarded if the Interface ID field in the message does not
   match the cached interface ID.

      <section title="Receiving ECMP Redirect" toc="default">
        <t>
   When a downstream router receives an ECMP Redirect, and detects that the
   desired RPF path from its upstream router's point of view is
   different from its current one, it should choose to join the newly
   suggested path and prune from the current path.  The exact order
   of such actions is implementation specific.</t>
        <t>If a downstream router receives multiple ECMP Redirects sent by
   different upstream routers, it SHOULD use the Preference, Metric, or
   other fields as specified below, as the tie breakers to choose the 
   most preferred RPF interface and neighbor.</t>
        <t>If an upstream router receives an ECMP Redirect, 
        it SHOULD NOT change its forwarding behavior even if the
        ECMP Redirect makes it a less preferred RPF neighbor on 
        the receiving interface.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Transient State" toc="default">
        <t>
   During a transient network outage with a single link cut in an
   ECMP bundle, a downstream router may lose connection to its RPF neighbor 
   and the normal ECMP Redirect operation may be interrupted temporarily. In 
   such an event, the following actions are RECOMMENDED.</t>
        <t>The downstream router SHOULD select a new RPF neighbor. Among
   all ECMP upstream routers, the one on the LAN the previous
   RPF neighbor resided on is preferred. </t>
        <t>If there is no upstream router reachable on the LAN the previous
   RPF neighbor resided on, the downstream 
   router will select a new RPF neighbor on a different LAN. 
   Among all ECMP upstream routers, the one that served as RPF neighbor before the 
   link failure is preferred.  Such a router can be identified by the Router ID,  
   which is part of the Interface ID in the PIM ECMP Redirect Hello option.</t>
        <t>
   During normal ECMP Redirect operations, when PIM Joins for the same (*,G) or
   (S,G) are received on a different LAN, an upstream router will send ECMP
   Redirect to prune the non-preferred LAN.  Such ECMP Redirects during partial
   network outage can be suppressed if the upstream router decides that the
   non-preferred PIM Join is from a router that is not reachable via the
   preferred LAN.  This check can be performed by retrieving the downstream's
   Router ID, using the source address in the PIM Join, and searching
   neighbors on the preferred LAN for one with the same router ID.

         <t> A PIM router sends ECMP Redirects on an interface

            <t>This document discusses Bidirectional PIM (BIDIR-PIM), a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that builds bidirectional shared trees connecting multicast sources and receivers.  Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology.  With the assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring source-specific state.  The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven protocol events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
