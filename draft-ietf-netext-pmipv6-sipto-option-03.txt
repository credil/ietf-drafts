       IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6
              draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option-03.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a mechanism and a related mobility option
   for carrying IPv4 Offload traffic selectors between a mobile access
   gateway and a local mobility anchor in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
   Based on the received offload flow selectors from the local mobility
   anchor, a mobile access gateway can enable offload traffic rule on
   the selected IPv4 flows.

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option     February 2012


1.  Introduction

   Mobile Operators are expanding their network coverage by integrating
   various access technology domains into a common IP mobile core.  For
   providing IP mobility support to a mobile node irrespective of the
   access network to which it is attached.  For example, the 3GPP S2a
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [TS23402] interface, specified by the 3GPP system
   architecture, is providing the needed protocol glue.  When this
   protocol interface based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is used, the
   mobile node is topologically anchored at the local mobility anchor
   [RFC5213] in the home network.  The mobile node's IP traffic is
   always tunneled back from the mobile access gateway [RFC5213] in the
   access network to the local mobility anchor in the home network.

   However, with the exponential growth in the mobile data traffic,
   mobile operators are exploring new ways to offload some of the IP
   traffic flows at the nearest access edge where ever there is an
   internet peering point, as supposed to carrying it all the way to the
   mobility anchor in the home network.  Not all IP traffic needs to be
   routed back to the home network, some of the non-essential traffic
   which does not require IP mobility support can be offloaded at the
   mobile access gateway in the access network.  This approach provides
   greater leverage and efficient usage of the mobile packet core which
   help lowering transport cost.  The local mobility anchor in the home
   network can potentially deliver the IP flow selectors to the mobile
   access gateway in the access network, for identifying the IP flows
   that needs to be offloaded.

   This document defines a new mobility option, IP Traffic Offload
   Selector option for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  This option can be
   used by the local mobility anchor to notify the mobile access gateway
   with the flow selectors that can used for selecting the flows for
   offloading them at the access edge.  Since, the mobile node's IP
   address topologically belongs to the home network, the offloaded IP
   traffic flows need to be NAT [RFC2663] translated.  Given this NAT
   translation requirement for the offloaded traffic, this approach will
   be limited to mobile node's IPv4 flows.  There are better ways to
   solve this problem for IPv6 and with the goal not to create NAT66
   requirement, this specification does not support traffic offload
   support for IPv6 flows.  This document also does not define any new
   semantics for flow selectors.  The flow identification and the
   related semantics are all leveraged from [RFC6088].

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the
   following abbreviations:

   IP Flow

      IP Flow represents a set of IP packets that match a traffic
      selector.  The selector is typically based on the source IP
      address, destination IP address, source port, destination port and
      other fields in upper layer headers.

   Selective IP Traffic Offload (SIPTO)

      The approach of selecting specific IP flows and routing them to
      the local network, as supposed to tunneling them to the home
      network.

   NAT (Network Address Translation)

      Network Address Translation [RFC2663] is a method by which IP
      addresses are mapped from one address realm to another, providing
      transparent routing to end hosts.


3.  Solution Overview

   The following illustrates the scenario where the mobile access
   gateway in an access network has the ability to offload some of the
   IPv4 traffic flows, based on the traffic selectors it received from
   the local mobility anchor in the home network.  For example, all the
   HTTP flows may be be offloaded at the mobile access gateway and all
   the other flows for that mobility session are tunneled back to the
   local mobility anchor.

   The selectors that are delivered to the mobile access gateway can be
   used to classify the traffic, so it can be offloaded to the local
   access network.  The parameters in the IP traffic selectors can be
   used to match against the fields in the IP packet header.  These
   parameters include Source IP address, Destination IP address, TCP/UDP

3.1.  LMA Considerations

   The following considerations apply to the local mobility anchor.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update includes the IP Traffic
      Offload Selector option Section 4, but if the configuration
      variable, EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport Section 6 on the local
      mobility anchor is set to a value of (0), then the local mobility
      anchor MUST ignore the IP Traffic Offload Selector option and
      process the rest of the packet as per [RFC5213].  This would not
      have no effect on the operation of the rest of the protocol.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update includes the IP Traffic
      Offload Selector option Section 4, and if the configuration
      variable, EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport Section 6 on the local
      mobility anchor is set to a value of (1), then the local mobility
      anchor can acquire the offload policy from a network function (Ex:
      AAA or PCRF) and can construct the traffic selectors based on the
      offload policy and deliver those selectors in the Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message using the IP Traffic Offload Selector
      option.  The specific details on how the offload policy for a
      mobile node is provisioned on the local mobility anchor is out of
      the scope for this document.  However, if the received Proxy
      Binding Update included a proposed Offload traffic selectors, the
      local mobility anchor MAY choose to honor that request and include
      the proposed selectors in the reply.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update does not include the IP
      Traffic Offload Selector option Section 4, and if the
      configuration variable, EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport Section 6 on
      the local mobility anchor is set to a value of (1), then the local
      mobility anchor SHOULD NOT include the IP Traffic Offload Selector
      option in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement.

3.2.  MAG Considerations

   o  If the configuration variable, EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport on
      the mobile access gateway is set to a value of (0), then the
      mobile access gateway MUST NOT include the IP Traffic Offload
      Selector option Section 4 in the Proxy Binding Update message that
      it sends to the local mobility anchor.  Otherwise, the option MUST
      be included in the Proxy Binding Update message.  When this option
      is included, it is an indication to the local mobility anchor that
      the mobile access gateway is capable of supporting IP Traffic
      Offload support.  The TS format field of the IP Traffic Offload
      Selector option MUST be set to a value of (0), indicating that the
      mobile access gateway is not proposing any specific offload policy
      for that mobility session, but a request to the local mobility
      anchor to provide the IP traffic offload flow selectors for that
      mobility session.

   o  The mobile access gateway MAY choose to include its proposed IP
      traffic offload flow selectors in the IP Traffic Offload Selector
      option Section 4.  Including this offload traffic selectors serves
      as a proposal to the local mobility anchor, which the local
      mobility anchor can override with its own offload policy, or agree
      to the proposed policy.  When including the offload traffic
      selectors, the TS format field of the IP Traffic Offload Selector
      option MUST be set to the respective flow specification type.

   o  If there is no IP Traffic Offload Selector option in the
      corresponding Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message, that the
      mobile access gateway receives in response to a Proxy Binding
      Update, it serves as an indication that the local mobility anchor
      does not support IP Traffic Offload support for that mobility
      session, and it implies the local mobility anchor cannot deliver
      IP flow selectors for that mobility session.  The mobile access
      gateway upon accepting the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message
      MUST NOT enable any offload policy for that mobility session.  All
      the mobile node's IP flows MUST be tunneled back to the local
      mobility anchor.

   o  If there is an IP Traffic Offload Selector option in the
      corresponding Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message, it is an
      indication that the local mobility anchor has provided the IP
      traffic Offload selectors for that mobility session [RFC5213] and
      the identified IP flows have to be offloaded.  Considerations
      related to (M) flag MUST be applied.

   o  If the mobile access gateway is not capable, or enabled to support
      IP Traffic Offload support, but if the received Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message has the IP Traffic Offload Selector

      option, the mobile access gateway SHOULD ignore the option and
      process the rest of the packet as per [RFC5213].


4.  IP Traffic Offload Selector Option

   A new mobility option, IP Traffic Offload Selector option, is defined
   for using it in Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) messages exchanged between a mobile access
   gateway and a local mobility anchor.  This option is used for
   carrying the flow selectors for enabling IP traffic offload function
   at the mobile access gateway.

   The alignment requirement for this option is 4n.

      flow(s) in this mobility option SHOULD be offloaded at the mobile
      access gateway.  If the (M) flag value is set to a value of (0),
      it is an indication that the identified IP flow(s) in this
      mobility option SHOULD be offloaded at the mobile access gateway

      to be tunneled to the local mobility anchor.

   TS Format
      An 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the Traffic Selector Format.
      The value of "0" is reserved and is used when there are no
      selectors to carry.  In this case, the option is used only as a
      capability indicator.  When the value of TS Format field is set to
      (1), the format that follows is the IPv4 Binary Traffic Selector
      specified in section 3.1 of [RFC6088].

   TS Selector
      A variable-length opaque field for including the traffic
      specification identified by the TS format field.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following two IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new Mobility Header option,
      IP Traffic Offload Selector option.  This option is described in
      Section 4.  The Type value for this option needs to be assigned
      from the same numbering space as allocated for the other mobility
      options [RFC6275].

   o  Action-2: The Sub-type field of the IP Traffic Offload Selector
      option introduces a new number space.  This number space needs to
      be managed by IANA, under the Registry, IP Traffic Offload
      Selector Type Registry.  This specification reserves the sub-type
      values of (0) and (1).  The value of "0" is reserved and is used
      when there are no selectors to carry, relevant when the option is
      used just as a capability indicator.  The value of (1) is assigned
      for IPv4 Binary Traffic Selector [RFC6088].  Approval of new sub-
      type values are to be made through IANA Expert Review.


6.  Protocol Configuration Variables

   This specification defines the following configuration variable that
   control the use of IP Traffic Offload support for a mobility session.
   The mobility entities, local mobility anchor and the mobile access
   gateway MUST allow these variables to be configured by the system
   management.  The configured values for these protocol variables MUST
   survive server reboots and service restarts.

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option     February 2012


   EnableIPTrafficOffloadSupport

         This flag indicates whether or not IP Traffic Offload support
         needs to be enabled.  This configuration variable is available
         at both in the mobile access gateway and at the local mobility
         anchor.  The default value for this flag is set to (0),
         indicating that the support for IP Traffic offload support is
         disabled.

         When this flag on the mobile access gateway is set to a value
         of (1), the mobile access gateway MUST enable the IP Traffic
         offload support for a mobility session, specifically it MUST
         include the IP Traffic Offload Selector option in the Proxy
         Binding Update messages and offload the negotiated IP flows to
         the access network.  If the value of the flag is set to a value
         of (0), mobile access gateway MUST NOT enable IP Traffic
         Offload support and it MUST NOT include this option in the
         Proxy Binding Update.

         Similarly, when this flag on the local mobility anchor is set
         to a value of (1), the local mobility anchor SHOULD enable
         support for IP Traffic offload support.  When the local
         mobility anchor chooses to enable IP Traffic offload support
         and if there is offload flow policy specified for a mobility
         node, it SHOULD deliver the offload selectors to the mobile
         access gateway by including the IP Traffic Offload Selector
         option in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.


7.  Security Considerations

   The IP Traffic Offload Selector option defined in this specification
   is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages.  This option is carried like any other mobility header
   option as specified in [RFC5213] and does not require any special
   security considerations.  Carrying IP traffic offload selectors does
   not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.

   When IPv4 traffic offload support is enabled for a mobile node, the
   mobile access gateway selectively offloads some of the mobile node's
   traffic flows to the local access network.  Typically, these
   offloaded flows get NAT translated and essentially that introduces
   certain vulnerabilities which are common to any NAT deployment.
   These vulnerabilities and the related considerations have been well
   documented in the NAT specification [RFC2663].  There are no
   additional considerations above and beyond what is already documented
   by the NAT specifications and which are unique to the approach
   specified in this document.
