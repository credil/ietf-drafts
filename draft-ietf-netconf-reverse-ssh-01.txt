Abstract

   This memo presents a technique for a NETCONF server to initiate a SSH
   connection to a NETCONF client.  This is accomplished by the NETCONF
   client listening on IANA-assigned TCP port YYYY and starting the SSH
   client protocol immediately after accepting a TCP connection on it.
   This role-reversal is necessary as the NETCONF server must also be
   the SSH Server, in order for the NETCONF client to open the IANA-
   assigned SSH subsystem "netconf".

1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This memo presents a technique for a NETCONF [RFC6241] server to
   initiate a Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] connection to a NETCONF
   client.  This is accomplished by the NETCONF client listening on
   IANA-assigned TCP port YYYY and starting the SSH client protocol
   immediately after accepting a TCP connection on it.  This role-
   reversal is necessary as the NETCONF server must also be the SSH
   Server, in order for the NETCONF client to open the IANA-assigned SSH
   subsystem "netconf" [RFC6242].

   While the motivation for this work is for the NETCONF protocol, the
   solution is not specific to NETCONF and is applicable any time it is
   desired for a SSH server to initiate a connection to a SSH client.
   For this reason, the solution is given the generic name "Reverse SSH"
   and the port the remote peer listens on is the Reverse SSH port.

3.  Benefits to Device Management

   The SSH protocol is nearly ubiquitous for device management, as it is
   the transport for the command-line applications `ssh`, `scp`, and
   `sftp` and is the required transport for the NETCONF protocol
   [RFC6241].  However, all these SSH-based protocols expect the managed
   device to be the SSH server.

   Reverse SSH enables the managed device to consistently be the SSH
   server regardless of which peer initiates the underlying TCP

   connection.  Maintaining the role of SSH Server is both necessary and
   desirable.  It is necessary because SSH channels and subsystems can
   only be opened on the SSH Server.  It is desirable because it
   conviently leverages infrastructure that may be deployed for host-key
   verification and user authentication.

   Reverse SSH is useful for both initial deployment and on-going device
   management and may be used to enable any of the following scenarios:

   o  The device may proactively "call home" after being powered on for
      the first time to register itself with its management system.

   o  The managed device may access the network in a way that
      dynamically assigns it an IP address and it doesn't register its
      assigned IP addressed to a mapping service.

   o  The managed device may be configured in "stealth mode" and thus
      doesn't have any open ports.

   o  The managed device may be deployed behind a firewall that doesn't
      allow SSH access to the internal network.

   o  The managed device may be deployed behind a firewall that
      implements network address translation (NAT) for all internal
      network IP addresses.

   o  The operator may prefer to have managed devices initiate
      management connections believing it is easier to secure one open-
      port in the data center than to have an open port on each managed
      device in the network.

   One key benefit of using SSH as the transport protocol is its ability
   to multiplex an unspecified number of independently flow-controlled
   TCP sessions [RFC4254].  This is valuable as the managed device only
   needs to be configured to initiate a single Reverse SSH connection
   regardless the number of TCP-based protocols the application wishes
   to support.  For instance, the application may "pin up" a channel for
   each distinct type of asynchronous notification the managed device
   supports (logs, traps, backups, etc.) and dynamically open/close
   channels as needed by its runtime.

4.  The Reverse SSH Protocol

   The NETCONF server's perspective

   o  The NETCONF server initiates a TCP connection to the NETCONF
      client on the IANA-assigned Reverse SSH port YYYY.

   o  Immediately after the TCP session starts, the NETCONF server
      starts the SSH server protocol using the accepted TCP connection.
      That is, the NETCONF Server sends its SSH host key during the SSH
      key exchange.

   The NETCONF client's perspective

   o  The NETCONF client listens for TCP connections on the IANA-
      assigned SSH port YYYY.

   o  The NETCONF client accepts an incoming TCP connection and
      immediately starts the SSH client protocol.  That is, the NETCONF
      client will need to authenticate its peer's SSH host key during
      the SSH key exchange.

   This document updates the SSH Transport Layer Protocol [RFC4253] only
   by removing the restriction in Section 4 (Connection Setup) of
   [RFC4252] that the SSH Client must initiate the transport connection.
   Security implications related to this change are discussed in the
   Security Considerations (Section 6) section.

   For first-time connections, in order for the NETCONF client to
   authenticate the NETCONF server, a public host key algorithm that
   certifies the the NETCONF server's identity and host-key SHOULD be
   used.  Examples of suitable public host key algorithms are the
   x509v3-* algorithms defined in [RFC6187].

5.  Device Configuration

   For devices supporting NETCONF, this section defines a YANG [RFC6020]
   module to configure Reverse SSH on the device.  For devices that do
   not support NETCONF, this section illustrates what its configuration
   data model SHOULD include.

   This YANG module enables a NETCONF client to generically manage a
   NETCONF server's Reverse SSH configuration.  Key aspects of this YANG
   module include support for more than one application, more than one
   server per application, and a reconnection strategy.

   This RFC does not attempt to define any strategy for how an initial
   deployment might obtain its bootstrapping "call home" configuration,
   as defined by this YANG module.  That said, implementations may
   consider fetching configuration from a server identified via the DHCP
   protocol or loading it off a USB drive plugged into the device before
   being powered on.

6.  Security Considerations

   This RFC deviates from standard SSH protocol usage by allowing the
   SSH server to initiate the TCP connection.  This conflicts with
   section 4 of the SSH Transport Layer Protocol RFC [RFC4253], which
   states "The client initiates the connection".  However this statement
   is made without rationalization and it's not clear how it impacts the
   security of the protocol, so this section analyzes the security
   offered by the having the client initiate the connection.

   First, assuming the SSH server is not using a public host key
   algorithm that certifies its identity, the security of the protocol
   doesn't seem to be sensitive to which peer initiates the connection.
   That is, it is still the case that reliable distribution of host keys

   (or their fingerprints) should occur prior to first connection and
   that verification for subsequent connections happens by comparing the
   host keys in locally cached database.  It does not seem to matter if
   the SSH Server's host name is derived from user-input or extracted
   from the TCP layer, potentially via a reverse-DNS lookup.  Once the
   host name-to-key association is stored in a local database, no man-
   in-the-middle attack is possible due to the attacker being unable to
   guess the real SSH server's private key (Section 9.3.4 (Man-in-th-
   middle) of [RFC4251]).

   That said, this RFC recommends implementations use a public host key
   algorithm that certifies the SSH server's identity.  The identity can
   be any unique identifier, such as a device's serial number or a
   deployment-specific value.  If this recommendation is followed, then
   no information from the TCP layer would be needed to lookup the
   device in a local database and therefore the directionality of the
   TCP layer is clearly inconsequential.

   The SSH protocol negotiates which algorithms it will use during key
   exchange (Section 7.1 (Algortihm Negotition) in [RFC4253]).  The
   algorithm selected is essentially the first compatible algorithm
   listed by the SSH client that is also listed by the SSH server.  For
   a network management application, there may be a need to advertise a
   large number of algorithms to be compatible with the various devices
   it manages.  It is RECOMMENDED that the SSH client orders its list of
   public host key algorithms such that all the certifiable public host
   key algorithms are listed first.  Additionally, when possible, SSH
   servers SHOULD only list certifiable public host key algorithms.
   Note that since the SSH server would have to be configured to know
   which IP address it needs to connect to, it is expected that it will
   also be configured to know which host key algorithm to use for the
   particular application, and hence only needs to list just that one
   public host key algorithm.

   This RFC suggests implementations can use a device's serial number as
   a form of identity.  A potential concern with using a serial number
   is that the SSH protocol passes the SSH server's host-key in the
   clear and many times serial numbers encode revealing information
   about the device, such as what kind of device it is and when it was
   manufactured.  While there is little security in trying to hide this
   information from an attacker, it is understood that some deployments
   may want to keep this information private.  If this is a concern,
   deployments MAY consider using instead a hash of the device's serial
   number or an application-specified unique identifier.

   An attacker could DoS the application by having it to perform
   computationally expensive operations, before deducing that the
   attacker doesn't posses a valid key.  This is no different than any

   secured service and all common precautions apply (e.g. blacklisting
   the source address after a set number of unsuccessful login
   attempts).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA assigns a TCP port number in the
   "Registered Port Numbers" range with the service name "reverse-ssh".
   This port will be the default port for the Reverse SSH protocol and
   will be used when the NETCONF server needs to initiate a connection
   to a NETCONF client using SSH.  Below is the registration template
   following the rules in [RFC6335].
