      <t>This document defines requirements for standards 
      specifications for energy management. The requirements defined
      in this document concern monitoring functions as well as 
      control functions:  Monitoring functions include identification 
      of energy-managed devices and their components, monitoring of 
      their power states, power inlets, power outlets, actual power, 
      power properties, received energy, provided energy, and 
      contained batteries.  
      Control functions serve for controlling  power supply and 
      power state of energy-managed devices and their components.<vspace />  
      This document does not specify the features that must be 
      implemented by compliant implementations but rather features 
      that must be supported by standards for energy management.</t>

    <!-- Introduction ========================================== -->
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>With rising energy cost and with an increasing awareness of 
      the ecological impact of running IT equipment, energy
      management functions and interfaces are becoming an additional 
      basic requirement for network management systems and devices
      connected to a network.</t>

      <t>This document defines requirements for standards 
      specifications for energy management, both monitoring 
      functions and control functions. Subject of energy management 
      are entities in the network.  An entity is either a device or 
      one of a device's components that is subject to individual
      energy monitoring or control or both.</t>
      
      <t>In detail, the requirements
      listed are focused on the following features: identification 
      of entities, monitoring of their Power State, 
      power inlets, power outlets, actual power, power properties, 
      received energy, provided energy, and contained batteries. 
      Further included is control of entities' power supply 
      and Power State.</t>
      
      <t>The main subject of energy management are devices and their 
      components that receive and provide electric energy.  Devices 
      may have an IP address, such as hosts, routers, and 
      middleboxes, or they are connected indirectly to the Internet
      via a proxy with an IP address providing a management 
      interface for the device. An example are devices in a building 
      infrastructure using non-IP protocols and a gateway to the 
      Internet.</t>
      
      <t>These requirements concern 
      the standards specification process and not the implementation
      of specified standards. All requirements in this document must
      be reflected by standards specifications to be developed. 
      However, which of the features specified by these standards 
      will be mandatory, recommended, or optional for compliant 
      implementations is to be defined by standards track 
      document(s) and not in this document.</t>

      <t><xref target="goals"/> elaborates a set of general needs 
      for energy management. Requirements
      for an energy management standard are specified in Sections 
      <xref format="counter" target="identity"/> to
      <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/>.</t>
      
      <t>Sections <xref format="counter" target="identity"/> to
      <xref format="counter" target="control"/> contain  
      conventional requirements specifying information on entities   
      and control functions.</t>
      
      <t>Sections <xref format="counter" target="reportonother"/> 
      and <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/> contain 
      requirements specific to energy management.  Due to the nature
      of power supply, some monitoring and control functions are not 
      conducted by interacting with the entity of interest, 
      but with other entities, for example, entities upstream in a 
      power distribution tree.</t>

      <section anchor="conventional" 
        title="Conventional Requirements For Energy Management">
        <t>The specification of requirements for an energy 
        management standard starts with <xref target="identity"/> 
        addressing the identification of entities and the 
        granularity of reporting of energy-related information. 
        A standard must support unique identification of 
        entities, reporting per entire device, and reporting 
        energy-related information on individual components of a 
        device or subtended devices.</t>

        <t><xref target="properties"/> specifies requirements 
        related to monitoring of entities. This includes 
        general (type, context) information and specific information
        on Power States, power inlets, power outlets, power, energy, 
        and batteries. Control Power State and power supply of 
        entities is covered by requirements specified in 
        <xref target="control"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Specific Requirements for Energy Management">

        <t>While the conventional requirements summarized above seem
        to be all that would be needed for energy management, there 
        are significant differences between energy management and 
        most well known network management functions.
        The most significant difference 
        is the need for some devices to report on other
        entities. There are three major reasons for this.
                
<!-- A new framework is necessary. -->

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>For monitoring a particular entity it is not 
          always sufficient to communicate with the entity 
          only. When the entity has no 
          instrumentation for determining power,
          it might still be possible to obtain power values for the
          entity by communication with other entities in its
          power distribution tree. 
          <vspace/>
          A simple example is retrieving power values from
          a power meter at the power line into the entity. 
          Common examples are a Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and
          a Power over Ethernet (PoE) switch. Both supply power to 
          other entities at sockets or ports, respectively, and are
          often instrumented to measure power per socket or port.
          </t>
      
          <t>Similar considerations apply to controlling power 
          supply of a entity which often needs direct or 
          indirect communications with 
          another entity upstream in the power distribution tree. 
          Again, a PDU and a PoE switch are common examples, if they 
          have the capability to switch on or off power at their 
          sockets or ports, respectively.</t>
      
          <t>Energy management often extends beyond entities with IP
          network interfaces, to non-IP building systems accessed 
          via a gateway.  Requirements in this document do not cover 
          details of these networks, but specify means for opening 
          IP network management towards them.</t>
<!--
          <t>For monitoring entities, as their number 
          becomes large, it is  sometimes not a scalable approach 
          to communicate directly with all entities directly
          from a central energy management system.</t> 
-->
        </list></t>
        
        <t>These specific issues of energy management and a set of 
        further ones are covered by requirements specified in 
        Sections <xref format="counter" target="reportonother"/> and
        <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/>.</t>
        
        <t>The requirements in these sections 
        need a new energy management framework  
        that deals with the specific nature 
        of energy management. 
        The actual standards documents, such as MIB module 
        specifications, address conformance by specifying which 
        feature must, should, or may be implemented by compliant 
        implementations.

    <!-- Objectives ============================================ -->

    <section anchor="goals" 
      title="General Considerations Related to Energy Management">
      <t>The basic objective of energy management is operating 
      sets of devices with minimal energy, while maintaining 
      a certain level of service.  Use cases 
      for energy management can be found in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-eman-applicability-statement"></xref>. 
      </t>  

      <section anchor="powerstates" title="Power States">
        <t>
        Entities can be set to an operational state that 
        results in the lowest power level that still meets the 
        service level performance objectives.  In principle, there 
        are three basic types of Power States for an entity 
        or for a whole system:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>full Power State</t>
<!--      <t>reduced Power States (e.g. lower clock rate for 
          processor, lower data rate on a link, etc.)</t>  -->
          <t>sleep state (not functional, but immediately 
          available)</t>
          <t>off state (may require significant time 
          to become operational)</t>
        </list>
        In specific devices, the number of Power States and their 
        properties varies considerably. Simple entities may just 
        have only the extreme states, full power and off state. 
        Many devices have three basic Power States: on, off, and 
        sleep.  However, more finely grained Power States can be 
        implemented.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="tradeoffs" 
        title="Saving Energy versus Maintaining Service Level Agreements">
        <t>While the general objective of energy management is quite 
        clear, the way to attain that goal is often difficult. 
        In many cases there is no way of reducing power 
        without the consequence of a potential performance, service, 
        or capacity degradation. Then a trade-off needs to be dealt 
        with between service level objectives and energy 
        minimization.  In other cases a reduction of power can 
        easily be achieved while still maintaining 
        sufficient service level performance, for example, by 
        switching entities to lower Power States when higher
        performance is not needed.</t> 
      </section>

      <section anchor="localglobal" 
               title="Local Versus network-Wide energy Management">
        <t>Many energy saving functions are executed locally by 
        an entity; it 
        monitors its usage and dynamically adapts its power 
        according to the required performance. It may, 
        for example, switch to a sleep state when it is not in use 
        or out of scheduled business hours. 
        An energy management system may
        observe an entity's power 
        state and configure its power saving policies.</t>

        <t>Energy savings can also be achieved with policies 
        implemented by a network management system that controls 
        Power States of managed entities.  Information about the 
        power received and provided by entities in different
        Power States may be required to set policies.  Often this 
        information is acquired best through monitoring.</t>
        
        <t>Both methods, network-wide and local energy management,
        have advantages and disadvantages and often it is desirable 
        to combine them. Central management is often favorable for 
        setting Power States of a large number of entities at the 
        same time, for example, at the beginning and end of business
        hours in a building. Local management is often preferable 
        for power saving measures based on local observations, such 
        as high or low functional load of an entity.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="monitoring" 
               title="Energy Monitoring Versus Energy Saving">
        <t>Monitoring energy, power, 
        and Power States alone does not reduce the energy
        needed to run an entity. In fact, it may even
        increase it slightly due to monitoring instrumentation that 
        needs energy. Reporting measured quantities
        over the network may also increase energy use, though the 
        acquired information may be an essential 
        input to control loops that save energy.</t>

        <t>Monitoring energy and Power States

      <t>Entities must be uniquely identified.  This 
      includes entities that are components of managed devices 
      as well as entire devices.</t> 
      
      <t>For entities 
      that report on or control other entities it is 
      important to identify the entities they report on or 
      control, see <xref target="reportonother"/> or 
      <xref target="controlother"/>, respectively.</t>      
      
      <t> An entity may be an entire device or a 
      component of it. Examples of components of interest are 
      a hard drive, a battery, or a line card. 
      It may be required to be able to control individual 
      components to save energy. For example, server blades 
      can be switched off when the overall load is low or line cards
      at switches may be powered down at night.</t>

      <t>Identifiers for devices and components  
      are already defined in standard MIB modules, such as the LLDP 
      MIB module <xref target="IEEE-802.1AB"/> and the LLDP-MED MIB 
      module <xref target="ANSI-TIA-1057"/> for devices and the 
      Entity MIB module <xref target="RFC4133"/> and the Power 
      Ethernet MIB <xref target="RFC3621"/> for components of 
      devices.  Energy management needs means to link 
      energy-related information to	such identifiers.</t>
        
      <t>Instrumentation for measuring received and provided energy 
      of a device is typically more expensive than instrumentation 
      for retrieving its Power State.  Many devices may provide

      <section anchor="inlet" title="Power Interfaces">
        <t>A Power Interface is an interface at which a device is 
        connected to a power transmission medium at which it can 
        receive power, provide power, or both.</t>
        
        <t>A Power Interface is either an inlet or an outlet.  
        Some Power Interfaces change over time from being an inlet 
        to being an outlet and vice versa.  However most power 
        interfaces never change.</t>
        
        <t>Devices have power inlets at which they are 
        supplied with electric power. Most devices have a 
        single power inlet, while some have multiple inlets. 
        Different power inlets on a device are often connected to 
        separate power distribution trees. For energy monitoring, 
        it is useful to retrieve information on the number of inlets 
        of a device, the availability of power at inlets 
        and which of them are actually in use.</t>
        
        <t>Devices can have one or more power outlets for 
        supplying other devices with electric power. </t>                                         

        <t>For identifying and potentially controlling the source of 
        power received at an inlet, it may be required to identify 
        the power outlet of another device at which the 
        received power is provided. Analogously, for each outlet it 
        is of interest to identify the power inlets that receive the
        power provided at a certain outlet.  Such information is 
        also required for constructing the wiring topology of 
        electrical power distribution to devices.</t>
        
        <t>Static properties of each Power Interface are required 
        information for energy management. Static properties

        typically controlled by automatic functions that act locally

        <t>Devices containing batteries can be modeled in two ways.

      <section anchor="timeseries" 
               title="Time Series Of Measured Values">
        <t>For some network management tasks, it is required to 
        obtain time series of measured values from entities, 
        such as power, energy, battery charge, etc.</t>
        
        <t>In general time series measurements could be obtained in 
        many different ways. It should be avoided that such time 
        series can only be obtained through regular polling by the 
        energy management system. Means should be provided to either 
        push such values from the location where they are available 
        to the management system or to have them stored locally for 
        a sufficiently long period of time such that a management 
        system can retrieve full time series.</t> 
        
        <t>The following issues are to be considered when designing
        time series measurement and reporting functions:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Which quantities should be reported?</t>
          <t>Which time interval type should be used (total, delta, 
          sliding window)?</t>
          <t>Which measurement method should be used (sampled, 
          continuous)?</t>
          <t>Which reporting model should be used (push or pull)?
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>The most discussed and probably most needed quantity 
        is energy. But a need for others, such as power and 
        battery charge can be identified as well.</t>

        <t>There are three time interval types under discussion for 
        accumulated quantities such as energy.  They can be reported 
        as total values, accumulated between the last restart of the 
        measurement and a certain timestamp. Alternatively, energy 
        can be reported as delta values between two consecutive 
        timestamps.  Another alternative is reporting values for 
        sliding windows as specified in <xref 
        target="IEC.61850-7-4"/>.</t>

        <t>For non-accumulative quantities, such as power, different 
        measurement methods are considered. Such quantities can be 
        reported using values sampled at certain time stamps or 
        alternatively by mean values for these quantities averaged 
        between two (consecutive) time stamps or over a sliding 
        window.</t>

        <t>Finally, time series can be reported using different 
        reporting models, particularly push-based or pull-based.  
        Push-based reporting can, for example, be realized by 
        reporting power or energy values using the IPFIX protocol 
        <xref target="RFC5101"/>,<xref target="RFC5102"/>.  SNMP 
        <xref target="RFC3411"/> is an example for a protocol that 
        can be used for realizing pull-based reporting of time 
        series.</t> 
        
        <t>For reporting time series of measured values the 
        following requirements have been identified.  Further 
        decisions concerning issues discussed above need to be 
        made when developing concrete energy management 
        standards.</t>

    <!-- Requirements related to Entity Control ================ -->

    <section anchor="control" title="Control Of Entities">
      <t>Many entities control their Power State locally.
      Other entities need interfaces for an energy 
      management system to control their Power State.</t>

      <t>Power supply is typically not self-managed by devices.  
      And controlling power supply is typically not conducted as 
      interaction between energy management system and 
      the device itself. It is rather an interaction between
      the management system and a device providing power at its 
      power outlets.  Similar to Power State control, power supply 
      control may be policy driven. Note that shutting down the 
      power supply abruptly may have severe consequences for the 
      device.</t>

    <section anchor="reportonother"

      entity. Such information may be provided by other 
      entities.  This section covers reporting of 
      information only. See <xref target="controlother"/> for 
      requirements on controlling other entities.</t>
      
      <t>There are cases where a power supply unit switches power 
      for several entities by turning power on or off at a 
      single power outlet or where a power meter measures the 
      accumulated power of several entities at a single 
      power line.  Consequently, it should be possible to report 
      that a monitored value does not relate to just a single 
      entity, but is an accumulated value for a set of 
      entities.  All of these entities belonging to
      that set need to be identified.</t>
      
<!--  
      <t>If an entity has information about where

  <section anchor="standards" title="Existing Standards">
      <t>This section analyzes existing standards for energy and
      Power State monitoring. It shows that there are already 
      several standards that cover only some part of the
      requirements listed above, but even all together they do not 
      cover all of the requirements for energy management.</t>

      <section title="Existing IETF Standards">
        <t>There are already RFCs available that address a subset of 
        the requirements.</t>
    
         <section title="ENTITY MIB">
          <t>The ENTITY-MIB module defined in <xref 
          target="RFC4133"/> was designed to model physical and 
          logical entities of a managed system.  A physical entity 
          is an identifiable physical component. A logical entity 
          can use one or more physical entities. From an energy 
          monitoring perspective of a managed system, the ENTITY-MIB 
          modeling framework can be reused and whenever <xref 
          target="RFC4133">RFC 4133</xref> has been implemented. 
          The entPhysicalIndex from entPhysicalTable can be used to 
          identify an entity/component. However, there are use cases 
          of energy monitoring, where the application of the 
          ENTITY-MIB does not seem readily apparent and some of those 
          entities could be beyond the original scope and intent of
          the ENTITY-MIB.</t>  

          <t>Consider the case of remote devices attached to the
          network, and the network device could collect the energy
          measurement and report on behalf of such attached devices.
          Some of the remote devices such as PoE phones attached to
          a switch port have been considered in the 
          Power-over-Ethernet MIB module <xref target="RFC3621"/>.  
          However, there are many other devices such as a computer, 
          which draw power from a wall outlet or building HVAC 
          devices which seem to be beyond the original scope of the 
          ENTITY-MIB.</t>  
          
          <t>Yet another example, is smart-PDUs, which can report 
          the energy provided to the device attached to the power 
          outlet of the PDU. In some cases, the device can be 
          attached to multiple to power outlets. Thus, the energy 
          measured at multiple outlets need to be aggregated to 
          determine the energy provided to a single device.  From 
          mapping perspective, between the PDU outlets and the 
          device this is a many-to-one mapping. It is not clear if 
          such a many-to-one mapping is feasible within the 
          ENTITY-MIB framework.</t>
         </section>

        <section title="ENTITY STATE MIB">
          <t><xref target="RFC4268">RFC 4268</xref> defines the 
          ENTITY STATE MIB module. Implementations of this module 
          provide information on entities including the standby 
          status (hotStandby, coldStandby, providingService), the 
          operational status (disabled, enabled, testing), the alarm 
          status (underRepair, critical, major, minor, warning), and 
          the usage status (idle, active, busy). This information is 
          already useful as input for policy decisions and for other 
          network management tasks. However, the number of states 
          would cover only a small subset of the requirements for 
          Power State monitoring and it does not provide means for 
          energy monitoring.  For associating the information 
          conveyed by the ENTITY STATE MIB to  specific components 
          of a device, the ENTITY STATE MIB module makes use of the 
          means provided by the <xref target="RFC4133">ENTITY MIB 
          module</xref>. Particularly, it uses the entPhysicalIndex 
          for identifying entities.</t>
          
          <t>The standby status provided by the ENTITY STATE MIB 
          module is related to Power States required for energy 
          management, but the number of states is too restricted for 
          meeting all energy management requirements.  For energy 
          management several more Power States are required, such as 
          different sleep and operational states as defined by the 
          <xref target="ACPI.R30b">Advanced Configuration and Power 
          Interface (ACPI)</xref> or the 
          <xref target="DMTF.DSP1027">DMTF Power State Management 
          Profile</xref>.</t>
          
        </section>

        <section title="ENTITY SENSOR MIB">
          <t><xref target="RFC3433">RFC 3433</xref> defines the 
          ENTITY SENSOR MIB module. Implementations of this module 
          offer a generic way to provide data collected by a sensor. 
          A sensor could be an energy meter delivering measured 
          values in Watt. This could be used for reporting current 
          power of an entity and its components.  Furthermore, the 
          ENTITY SENSOR MIB can be used to retrieve the accuracy of 
          the used power meter.</t>

          <t>Similar to the ENTITY STATE MIB module, the ENTITY 
          SENSOR MIB module makes use of the means provided by the 
          <xref target="RFC4133">ENTITY MIB module</xref> for 
          relating provided information to components of a device. 
          </t>
          
          <t>However, there is no unit available for reporting 
          energy quantities, such as, for example, watt seconds or 
          kilowatt hours, and the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module does not 
          support reporting accuracy of measurements according to 
          the IEC / ANSI accuracy classes, which are commonly in use 
          for electric power and energy measurements. The ENTITY 
          SENSOR MIB modules only provides a coarse-grained method 
          for indicating accuracy by stating the number of correct 
          digits of fixed point values.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="UPS MIB">
          <t><xref target="RFC1628">RFC 1628</xref> defines the UPS 
          MIB module. Implementations of this module provide 
          information on the current real power of entities attached 
          to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) device.  This 
          application would require identifying which entity is 
          attached to which port of the UPS device.</t>
          
          <t>UPS MIB provides information on the state of the UPS 
          network.  The MIB module contains several variables that 
          are used to identify the UPS entity (name, model,..), the 
          Battery State, to characterize the input load to the UPS, 
          to characterize the output from the UPS, to indicate the 
          various alarm events.  The measurements of power in UPS 
          MIB are in Volts, Amperes and Watts.  The units of power 
          measurement are RMS volts, RMS Amperes and are not based 
          on Entity-Sensor MIB <xref target="RFC3433"/>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="POWER ETHERNET MIB">
          <t>Similar to the UPS MIB, implementations of the POWER 
          ETHERNET MIB module defined in <xref 
          target="RFC3621">RFC3621</xref> provide information on the 
          current power of the entities that receive Power over 
          Ethernet (PoE). This information can be retrieved at the 
          power sourcing equipment. Analogous to the UPS MIB, it is 
          required to identify which entities are attached to which 
          port of the power sourcing equipment.</t>
          
          <t>The  POWER ETHERNET MIB does not report power and 
          energy on a per port basis, but can report aggregated 
          values for groups of ports. It does not use objects of the 
          ENTITY MIB module for identifying entities, although this
          module existed already when the POWER ETHERNET MIB modules 
          was standardized.</t>          
        </section>

        <section title="LLDP MED MIB">
          <t>The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) defined in 
          IEEE 802.1ab is a data link layer protocol used by network 
          devices for advertising of their identities, capabilities, 
          and interconnections on a LAN network.  
              
          The Media Endpoint Discovery (MED) (ANSI-TIA-1057) is an 
          enhancement of LLDP known as LLDP-MED. The LLDP-MED 
          enhancements specifically address voice applications.  
          LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: capabilities discovery, 
          LAN speed and duplex discovery, network policy discovery, 
          location identification discovery, inventory discovery,

          scope of energy management since these devices receive 
          power and are attached to the network. In addition, there 
          is ample scope of power management since printers and
          imaging systems are not used that often.  IEEE-ISTO
          Printer working group has defined MIB modules for
          monitoring power and Power State series that can be useful
          for power management of printers. The energy management 
          framework should also take into account the standards
          defined in the Printer working group.  In terms of other
          standards, IETF Printer MIB <xref 
          target="RFC3805">RFC3805</xref> has been standardized,
          however, this MIB module does not address power management
          of printers.</t>
