           Reverse DNS in IPv6 for Internet Service Providers
                      draft-howard-isp-ip6rdns-06

Abstract

   In IPv4, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) commonly provide IN-
   ADDR.ARPA. information for their customers by prepopulating the zone
   with one PTR record for every available address.  This practice does
   not scale in IPv6.  This document analyzes different approaches for
   ISPs to manage the ip6.arpa zone for IPv6 address space assigned to
   many customers.

Internet-Draft        Reverse DNS in IPv6 for ISPs         November 2012


1.  Introduction

   Best practice [RFC1033] is that "Every Internet-reachable host should
   have a name"[RFC1912]that is recorded with a PTR resource record in
   the .ARPA zone.  Many network services perform a PTR lookup on the
   source address of incoming packets before performing services.

   Individual Internet users in the residential or consumer scale,
   including small and home businesses, are constantly joining or moving
   on the Internet.  For large Internet service providers who serve
   residential users, maintenance of individual PTR records is often
   impractical.  Administrators at ISPs should evaluate methods for
   responding to reverse DNS queries in IPv6.

1.1.  Reverse DNS in IPv4

   ISPs that provide access to many residential users typically assign
   one or a few IPv4 addresses to each of those users, and populate an
   IN-ADDR.ARPA zone with one PTR record for every IPv4 address.  Some
   ISPs also configure forward zones with matching A records, so that
   lookups match.  For instance, if an ISP Example.com aggregated
   192.0.2.0/24 at a network hub in Anytown in the province of AnyWhere,
   the reverse zone might look like:

         1.2.0.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IN PTR 1.user.anytown.AW.example.com.

         2.2.0.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IN PTR 2.user.anytown.AW.example.com.

         .

         254.2.0.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IN PTR
         254.user.anytown.AW.example.com.

   The conscientious Example.com might then also have a zone:

         1.user.anytown.AW.example.com.  IN A 192.0.2.1

         2.user.anytown.AW.example.com.  IN A 192.0.2.2

         3.user.anytown.AW.example.com.  IN A 192.0.2.3

         .

         .

         .

         254.user.anytown.AW.example.com.  IN A 192.0.2.254

   Many ISPs generate PTR records for all IP addresses used for
   customers, and many create the matching A record.

1.2.  Reverse DNS Considerations in IPv6

   The length of individual addresses makes manual zone entries
   cumbersome.  A sample entry for 2001:0db8:0f00:0000:0012:34ff:fe56:
   789a might be:

         a.9.8.7.6.5.e.f.f.f.4.3.2.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.f.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2
         .IP6.ARPA.  IN PTR 1.user.anytown.AW.example.com.

   Since 2^^80 possible addresses could be configured in the 2001:db8:
   f00/48 zone alone, it is impractical to write a zone with every
   possible address entered.  If 1000 entries could be written per
   second, the zone would still not be complete after 38 trillion years.

   Furthermore, since the 64 bits in the host portion of the address are
   frequently assigned using SLAAC [RFC4862] when the host comes online,
   it is not possible to know which addresses may be in use ahead of
   time.

   [RFC1912]is an informational document that says "PTR records must
   point back to a valid A record" and further that the administrator
   should "Make sure your PTR and A records match."[RFC1912] DNS
   administrators of residential ISPs should consider how to follow this
   advice for AAAA and PTR RRs in the residential ISP.


2.  Alternatives in IPv6

   Several options exist for providing reverse DNS in IPv6.  All of
   these options also exist for IPv4, but the scaling problem is much
   less severe in IPv4.  Each option should be evaluated for its scaling
   ability, its compliance with existing standards and best practices,
   and its availability in common systems.

2.1.  Negative Response

   Some ISP DNS administrators may choose to provide only a NXDomain
   response to PTR queries for subscriber addresses. In some ways, this
   is the most accurate response, since no name information is known
   about the host.  Providing a negative response in response to PTR
   queries does not satisfy the expectation in [RFC1912] for entries to
   match.  Users of services which are dependent on a successful lookup
   will have a poor experience.  For instance, some web services and SSH
   connections wait for a DNS response, even NXDOMAIN, before
   responding.  On the other hand, external mail servers are likely to
   reject connections, which might be an advantage in fighting spam. DNS
   administrators should consider the uses for reverse DNS records and
   the number of services affecting the number of users when evaluating
   this option.

2.2.  Wildcard match

   The use of wildcards in the DNS is described in [RFC4592], and their
   use in IPv6 reverse DNS is described in [RFC4472].

   While recording all possible addresses is not scalable, it may be
   possible to record a wildcard entry for each prefix assigned to a
   customer.  Consider also that "inclusion of wildcard NS RRSets in a
   zone is discouraged, but not barred." [RFC4035]

   This solution generally scales well.  However, since the response
   will match any address in the wildcard range (/48, /56, /64, etc.), a
   forward DNS lookup on that response given will not be able to return
   the same hostname.  This method therefore fails the expectation in
   [RFC1912] for forward and reverse to match.  DNSsec [RFC4035]
   scalability is limited to signing the wildcard zone, which may be
   satisfactory.

Internet-Draft        Reverse DNS in IPv6 for ISPs         November 2012


2.3.  Dynamic DNS

   One way to ensure forward and reverse records match is for hosts to
   update DNS servers dynamically, once interface configuration (whether
   SLAAC, DHCPv6, or other means) is complete, as described in
   [RFC4472]. Hosts would need to provide both AAAA and PTR updates, and
   would need to know which servers would accept the information.

   This option should scale as well or as poorly as IPv4 dynamic DNS
   does.  Dynamic DNS may not scale effectively in large ISP networks
   which have no single master name server, but a single master server
   is not best practice. The ISP's DNS system may provide a point for
   Denial of Service attacks, including many attempted dDNS updates. 
   Accepting updates only from authenticated sources may mitigate this
   risk, but only if authentication itself does not require excessive
   overhead.  No authentication of dynamic DNS updates is inherently
   provided; implementers should consider use of TSIG [RFC2845], or at
   least ingress filtering so updates are only accepted from customer
   address space from internal network interfaces, rate limit the number
   of updates from a customer per second, and consider impacts on
   scalability.  UDP is allowed per [RFC2136] so transmission control is
   not assured, though the host should expect an ERROR or NOERROR
   message from the server [RFC2136]; TCP provides transmission control,
   but the updating host would need to be configured to use TCP.

   Administrators should consider what domain will contain the records,
   and who will provide the names.  If subscribers provide hostnames,
   they may provide inappropriate strings.  Consider "ihate.example.com"
   or "badword.customer.example.com" or
   "celebrityname.committed.illegal.acts.example.com."  

   There is no assurance of uniqueness if multiple hosts try to update
   with the same name ("mycomputer.familyname.org"). There is no
   standard way to indicate to a host what server it should send dDNS
   updates to.


2.3.1.  Dynamic DNS from Individual Hosts

   In the simplest case, a residential user will have a single host
   connected to the ISP.  Since the typical residential user cannot
   configure IPv6 addresses and resolving name servers on their hosts,
   the ISP should provide address information conventionally (i.e.,
   their normal combination of RAs, DHCP, etc.), and should provide a
   DNS Recursive Name Server and Domain Search List as described in
   [RFC3646] or [RFC6106].  In determining its Fully Qualified Domain
   Name, a host will typically use a domain from the Domain Search List.
   This is an overloading of the parameter; multiple domains could be
 


Howard                 Expires September 25, 2013               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Reverse DNS in IPv6 for ISPs         November 2012


   listed, since hosts may need to search for unqualified names in
   multiple domains, without necessarily being a member of those
   domains.  Administrators should consider whether the domain search
   list actually provides an appropriate DNS suffix(es) when considering
   use of this option.  For purposes of dynamic DNS, the host would
   concatenate its local hostname (e.g., "hostname") plus the domain(s)
   in the Domain Search List (e.g., "customer.example.com"), as in
   "hostname.customer.example.com."

   Once it learns its address, and has a resolving name server, the host
   must perform an SOA lookup on the ip6.arpa record to be added, to
   find the owner, which will lead to the SOA record.  Several recursive
   lookups may be required to find the longest prefix which has been
   delegated.  The DNS administrator must designate the Primary Master
   Server for the longest match required.  Once found, the host sends
   dynamic AAAA and PTR updates using the concatenation defined above
   ("hostname.customer.example.com").

   In order to use this alternative, hosts must be configured to use
   dynamic DNS.  This is not default behavior for many hosts, which is
   an inhibitor for the large ISP.  This option may be scalable,
   although registration following an outage may cause signficant load,
   and hosts using privacy extensions [RFC4941] may update records
   daily.  It is up to the host to provide matching forward and reverse
   records, and to update them when the address changes.

2.3.2.  Dynamic DNS through Residential Gateways

   Residential customers may have a gateway, which may provide DHCPv6
   service to hosts from a delegated prefix.  ISPs should provide a DNS
   Recursive Name Server and Domain Search List to the gateway, as
   described above and in[RFC3646] and [RFC6106].  There are two options
   for how the gateway uses this information.  The first option is for
   the gateway to respond to DHCPv6 requests with the same DNS Recursive
   Name Server and Domain Search List provided by the ISP.  The
   alternate option is for the gateway to relay dynamic DNS updates from
   hosts to the servers and domain provided by the ISP.  Host behavior
   is unchanged; they should provide updates to the ISP's servers as
   described above.

2.3.3.  Automatic DNS Delegations

   An ISP may delegate authority for a subdomain such as
   "customer12345.anytown.AW.customer.example.com" or
   "customer12345.example.com" to the customer's gateway.  Each domain
   thus delegated must be unique within the DNS.  The ISP may also then
   delegate the ip6.arpa zone for the prefix delegated to the customer,
   as in (for 2001:db8:f00::/48) "0.0.f.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa."

Internet-Draft        Reverse DNS in IPv6 for ISPs         November 2012


   Then the customer could provide updates to their own gateway, with
   forward and reverse.  However, individual hosts connected directly to
   the ISP rarely have the capability to run DNS for themselves;
   therefore, an ISP can only delegate to customers with gateways
   capable of being authoritative name servers.  If a device requests a
   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, that may be considered a reasonably
   reliable indicator that it is a gateway, rather than an individual
   host.  It is not necessarily an indicator that the gateway is capable
   of providing DNS services, and therefore cannot be relied upon as a
   way to test whether this option is feasible.  In fact, this kind of
   delegation will not work for devices complying with [RFC6092], which
   includes the requirement, "By DEFAULT, inbound DNS queries received
   on exterior interfaces MUST NOT be processed by any integrated DNS
   resolving server."

   If the customer's gateway is the name server, it provides its own
   information to hosts on the network, as often done for enterprise
   networks, and as described in [RFC2136].

   An ISP may elect to provide authoritative responses as a secondary
   server to the customer's primary server.  For instance, the home
   gateway name server could be the master server, with the ISP
   providing the only published NS authoritative servers.

   To implement this alternative, users' residential gateways must be
   capable of acting as authoritative name servers capable of dynamic
   DNS updates.  There is no mechanism for an ISP to dynamically
   communicate to a user's equipment that a zone has been delegated, so
   user action would be required.  Most users have neither the equipment
   nor the expertise to run DNS servers, so this option is unavailable
   to the residential ISP.

2.3.4.  Generate Dynamic Records

   An ISP's name server that receives a dynamic forward or reverse DNS
   update may create a matching entry.  Since a host capable of updating
   one is generally capable of updating the other, this should not be
   required, but redundant record creation will ensure a record exists.
   ISPs implementing this method should check whether a record already
   exists before accepting or creating updates.

   This method is also dependent on hosts being capable of providing
   dynamic DNS updates, which is not default behavior for many hosts.

2.3.5.  Populate from DHCP Server

   A ISP's DHCPv6 server may populate the forward and reverse zones when
   the DHCP request is received, if the request contains enough

   information.  [RFC4704]

   However, this method will only work for a single host address
   (IA_NA); the ISP's DHCP server would not have enough information to
   update all records for a prefix delegation.  If the zone authority is
   delegated to a home gateway which used this method, the gateway could
   update records for residential hosts.  To implement this alternative,
   users' residential gateways would have to support the FQDN DHCP
   option, and would have to either have the zones configured, or send
   dDNS messages to the ISP's name server.

Internet-Draft        Reverse DNS in IPv6 for ISPs         November 2012


2.3.6.  Populate from RADIUS Server

   A user may receive an address or prefix from a RADIUS [RFC2865]
   server, the details of which may be recorded via RADIUS Accounting
   [RFC2866] data.  The ISP may populate the forward and reverse zones
   from the accounting data if it contains enough information.  This
   solution allows the ISP to populate data concerning allocated
   prefixes (as per 2.2 (wildcards)) and CPE endpoints, but as with
   2.3.5 does not allow the ISP to populate information concerning
   individual hosts.

2.4.  Delegate DNS

   For customers who are able to run their own DNS servers, such as
   commercial customers, often the best option is to delegate the
   reverse DNS zone to them, as described in [RFC2317] (for IPv4).
   However, since most residential users have neither the equipment nor
   the expertise to run DNS servers, this method is unavailable to
   residential ISPs.

   This is a general case of the specific case described
   inSection 2.3.3.  All of the same considerations still apply.

2.5.  Dynamically Generate PTR When Queried ("On the Fly")

   Common practice in IPv4 is to provide PTR records for all addresses,
   regardless of whether a host is actually using the address.  In IPv6,
   ISPs may generate PTR records for all IPv6 addresses as the records
   are requested.  Configuring records "on the fly" may consume more
   processor resource than other methods, but only on demand.  A denial
   of service is therefore possible, which may be mitigated with rate-
   limiting and normal countermeasures.

   An ISP using this option should generate a PTR record on demand, and
   cache or prepopulate the forward (AAAA) entry for the duration of the
   time-to-live of the PTR. Similarly, the ISP would prepopulate the PTR
   following a AAAA query. Alternatively, if an algorithm is used to
   generate unique name, it can be employed on the fly in both
   directions. This option has the advantage of assuring matching
   forward and reverse entries, while being simpler than dynamic DNS. 
   Administrators should consider whether the lack of user-specified
   hostnames is a drawback.

   This method may not scale well in conjunction with DNSsec [RFC4035],
   because of the additional load, but since keys may be pregenerated
   for zones, and not for each record, the risk is moderate.  Signing
   records on the fly may increase load, and may not scale; unsigned
   records can indicate that these records are less trusted, which might

   be acceptable.

   Another consideration is that the algorithm used for generating the
   record must be the same on all servers for a zone.  In other words,
   any server for the zone must produce the same response for a given
   query.  Administrators managing a variety of rules within a zone
   might find it difficult to keep those rules synchronized on all
   servers.


3.  Recommendations

   The best accuracy would be achieved if ISPs delegate authority along
   with address delegation, but residential users rarely have domain
   names or authoritative name servers.  

   Dynamic DNS updates can provide accurate data, but there is no
   standard way to indicate to residential devices where to send
   updates, if the hosts support it, and if it scales.  

   An ISP has no knowledge of its residential users' hostnames, and
   therefore can either provide a wildcard response, a dynamically
   generated response, or a negative response.

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Using Reverse DNS for Security

   Some people think the existence of reverse DNS records, or matching
   forward and reverse DNS records, provides useful information about
   the hosts with those records.  For example, one might infer that the
   administrator of a network with properly configured DNS records was
   better-informed, and by further inference more responsible, than the
   administrator of a less-thoroughly configured network.  For instance,
   most email providers will not accept incoming connections on port 25
   unless forward and reverse DNS entries match.  If they match, but
   information higher in the stack (for instance, mail source) is
   inconsistent, the packet is questionable.  These records may be
   easily forged though, unless DNSsec or other measures are taken.  The
   string of inferences is questionable, and may become unneeded if
   other means for evaluating trustworthiness (such as positive
   reputations) become predominant in IPv6.

   Providing location information in PTR records is useful for
   troubleshooting, law enforcement, and geolocation services, but for
   the same reasons can be considered sensitive information.

4.3.  Considerations for Other Uses of the DNS

   Several methods exist for providing encryption keys in the DNS.  Any
   of the options presented here may interfere with these key
   techniques.
