Abstract

   This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label
Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  Extended from MPLS
technologies, MPLS-TP introduces new OAM capabilities, a transport-
oriented path protection mechanism, and strong emphasis on static
provisioning supported by network management systems.  This document
addresses the security aspects that are relevant in the context of
MPLS-TP specifically.  It describes the security requirements for
MPLS-TP and potential security threats and mitigation procedures for
MPLS-TP networks and MPLS-TP inter-connection to MPLS and GMPLS
networks.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP Security Framework           October 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background and Motivation

   This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label
Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).

   The MPLS-TP Requirements and MPLS-TP Framework are defined in 
[RFC5654] and [RFC5921] respectively.  The intent of MPLS-TP development 
is to address the needs for transport evolution and the fast-growing 
bandwidth demand accelerated by new packet-based services and multimedia
applications, from Ethernet Services, Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPNS, and
triple play to Mobile Access Network (RAN) backhaul, etc.  MPLS-TP is
based on MPLS technologies to take advantage of this technology's
maturity, and MPLS-TP is required to maintain the transport
characteristics of MPLS.

   Focused on meeting transport requirements, MPLS-TP uses a subset of
MPLS features and introduces extensions to reflect the transport
technology characteristics.  The added functionalities include in-
band OAM, transport-oriented path protection and recovery mechanisms,
etc.  There is strong emphasis on static provisioning supported by
Network Management Systems (NMS) or Operation Support Systems (OSS).
There are also needs for MPLS-TP and MPLS interworking.

   The security aspects for the new extensions particularly designed for 
MPLS-TP need to be addressed.  The security models, requirements, 
threats, and defense techniques previously defined in [RFC5921] can be 
applied to reuse existing functionalities in MPLS and GMPLS but are not 
sufficient to cover the new extensions.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

1.2.  Scope

   This document addresses the security aspects specific to MPLS-TP.  It 
provides the security requirements for MPLS-TP, defines security models 
that apply to various MPLS-TP deployment scenarios, and identifies the 
potential security threats and mitigation procedures for MPLS-TP 
networks and MPLS-TP inter-connection to MPLS or GMPLS networks.  
Inter-AS and Inter-provider security for MPLS-TP to MPLS-TP connections 
or MPLS-TP to MPLS connections are discussed, because these connections 
present higher security risk factors than connections for Intra-AS 
MPLS-TP.

Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP Security Framework           October 2011


   The general security analysis and guidelines for MPLS and GMPLS are
addressed in [RFC5920], and the content of [RFC5920] that has no new 
impact on MPLS-TP is not repeated in this document.  Other general 
security issues regarding transport networks that are not specific to 
MPLS-TP are also out of scope.  Readers may also refer to the "Security 
Best Practices Efforts and Documents" Opsec Effort [opsec-efforts] and 
"Security Mechanisms for the Internet" [RFC3631] (if there are linkages 
to the Internet in the applications) for general network operations 
security considerations.  This document does not define the specific 
mechanisms or methods that must be implemented to satisfy the security 
requirements.

   The issues and areas addressed with respect to MPLS-TP security are:

o  G-Ach (control plane attack, DoS attack, message intercept, etc.)

o  ID Spoofing 

o  Loopback attacks

o  NMS attacks

o  NMS and CP interaction vulnerabilities

o  MIP and MEP assignment and attacks on these mechanisms

o  Topology discovery vulnerabilities

o  Data plane authentication

o  Label authentication

o  DoS attacks on the Data Plane

o  Performance Monitoring vulnerabilities

1.3.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  Although
this document is not a protocol specification, the use of this
language clarifies the instructions to protocol designers producing
solutions that satisfy the requirements set out in this document.

2.  Security Reference Models

   This section defines reference models for security in MPLS-TP
networks.

   The models are built on the architecture of MPLS-TP defined in
[RFC5921].  The Service Provider (SP) boundaries play an important
role in determining the security models for any particular
deployment.

   This document defines a trusted zone as being where a single SP has
total operational control over that part of the network.  A primary 
concern is about security aspects that relate to breaches of
security from the "outside" of a trusted zone to the "inside" of this
zone.

2.1.  Security Reference Model 1

   In reference model 1, a single SP has total control of the PE/T-PE to
PE/T-PE part of the MPLS-TP network.

2.2.  Security Reference Model 2

   In reference model 2, a single SP does not have total control
of the PE/T-PE to PE/T-PE part of the MPLS-TP network. S-PE and T-PE may 
be under the control of different SPs or their customers or may not be
trusted for some other reason.  The MPLS-TP network is not contained
within a single trusted zone.

2.4.  Trusted-Zone Boundaries

   The boundaries of a trusted zone should be carefully defined when
analyzing the security properties of each individual network. As
illustrated above, the security boundaries determine which
reference model should be applied to the use case analysis.

   A key requirement of MPLS-TP networks is that the security of a
trusted zone MUST NOT be compromised by interconnecting one SP's
MPLS-TP or MPLS infrastructure with another SP's core devices, T-PE 
devices, or end users.

   In addition, neighboring nodes in the network may be trusted or
untrusted.  Neighbors may also be authorized or unauthorized.  Even
though a neighbor may be authorized for communication, it may not be
trusted.  For example, when connecting with another provider's S-PE
to set up Inter-AS LSPs, the other provider is considered to be
untrusted but may be authorized for communication.

3.  Security Requirements for MPLS-TP

   This section covers security requirements for securing an MPLS-TP
network infrastructure.  The MPLS-TP network can be operated without
a control plane or via dynamic control plane protocols.  The
security requirements related to new MPLS-TP OAM, recovery
mechanisms, MPLS-TP and MPLS interconnection, and MPLS-TP specific
operations are addressed in this section.

   A service provider may choose the deployment options best fitting 
for its network operations.  This document does not mandate that an 
MPLS-TP network must fulfill all security requirements listed to be 
secure.

   These requirements are focused on: 1) how to protect the MPLS-TP
network from various attacks originating outside the trusted zone
including those from network users, both accidental and malicious; 2)
prevention of operational errors resulting from misconfiguration
within the trusted zone.

o  MPLS-TP MUST support the physical and logical separation of the 
data plane from the control plane and the management plane.  That is, 
if the control plane, management plane, or both are attacked and 
cannot function normally, the data plane should continue to forward
packets without being impacted.

o  MPLS-TP MUST support static provisioning of MPLS-TP LSPs and PWs
with or without an NMS or OSS, without using control protocols.  This 
is particularly important in the case of security model 2(a)

      (Figure 3) and security model 2(b) (Figure 4) where some or all
T-PEs are not in the trusted zone, and in the inter-provider cases
in security model 2(c) (Figure 5) when the connecting S-PE is not in
the trusted zone.

o  MPLS-TP MUST support non-IP path options in addition to the IP
   loopback option.  Non-IP path options when used in security model 2 
   (Section 2.2) may help to lower the potential risk of attacks on
   the S-PE/T-PE in the trusted zone.

o  MPLS-TP MUST support authentication of any control protocol used
   for an MPLS-TP network, as well as for MPLS-TP network to dynamic 
   MPLS network inter-connection.

o  MPLS-TP MUST support mechanisms to prevent Denial of Service (DoS)
   attacks via any in-band OAM or G-ACh/GAL.

o  MPLS-TP MUST support hiding of the Service Provider's 
   infrastructure for all reference models regardless of whether the 
   network(s) are using static configuration or a dynamic control 
   plane.

o  Management security requirements from [RFC5951] include the 
   following:

*  MPLS-TP MUST support security for the management communication 
   channel (MCC).

*  Secure communication channels MUST be supported for all network
   traffic and protocols used to support management functions. This MUST 
   include protocols used for configuration, monitoring, configuration 
   backup, logging, time synchronization, authentication, and routing.

*  The MCC MUST provide support for confidentiality and data integrity 
   protection for applications.

*  The MCC MUST support the use of a flexible set of strong, open, and 
   standard cryptographic algorithms (see Section 2.2 of [RFC3871]).

*  The MCC MUST support authentication to ensure that management
   connectivity and activity is only from authenticated entities.

*  The MCC MUST support port access control.

*  Distributed Denial of Service: It is possible to lessen the
   potential and impact for DoS and DDoS attacks by using secure
   protocols, turning off unnecessary processes, logging and
   monitoring, and ingress filtering.  See [RFC4732] for
   background on DoS in the context of the Internet.

Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP Security Framework           October 2011


o  MPLS-TP MUST provide protection from operational errors.  Due to
the extensive use of static provisioning with or without a NMS or
OSS, the prevention of configuration errors should be addressed as
a major set of security requirements.


4.  Security Threats

   This section discusses the various network security threats that may
endanger MPLS-TP networks.  The discussion is limited to those
threats that are unique to MPLS-TP networks or that affect MPLS-TP
networks in unique ways.

   A successful attack on a particular MPLS-TP network or on a SP's
MPLS-TP infrastructure may cause one or more of the following ill
effects:

   1.  Observation (including traffic pattern analysis), modification,
       or deletion of a provider's or user's data, as well as replay or
       insertion of inauthentic data into a provider's or user's data
       stream.  These types of attacks apply to MPLS-TP traffic
       regardless of how the LSP or PW is set up in a similar way to how
       they apply to MPLS traffic regardless how the LSP is set up.

   2.  Attacks on GAL label or BFD messages:

       a.  GAL label or BFD label manipulation, which includes insertion 
           of false labels or messages, and modification or removal of 
           GAL labels or messages by attackers.

       b.  DoS attack through in-band OAM G-ACH/GAL and BFD messages.

   3.  Disruption of a provider's or user's connectivity, or degradation 
       of a provider's service quality.

       a.  Attacks against provider connectivity:

           +  In the case in which an NMS is used for LSP set-up, the 
              attacks occur through attacks on the NMS.

           +  In the case in which dynamic provisioning is used, the 
              attacks 
              occur on the dynamic control plane.  Most aspects of these 
              are addressed in [RFC5920].

        b.  Attacks against user connectivity.  These are similar to 
            PE/CE attacks against access in typical MPLS networks and 
            are addressed in [RFC5920].


Fang, et al.              Expires April 30, 2012               [Page 16]


Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP Security Framework           October 2011


   4.  Probing a provider's network to determine its configuration,
       capacity, or usage.  These types of attack can occur through 
       attacks against an NMS in the case of static provisioning, or 
       through attacks against the control plane in dynamic MPLS 
       networks. They can also be combined attacks.

   It is useful to consider that threats, whether malicious or
accidental, may come from different categories of sources.  For
example they may come from:

o  Other users whose services are provided by the same MPLS-TP core.

o  The MPLS-TP SP or persons working for it.

o  Other persons who obtain physical access to a MPLS-TP SP's site.

o  Other persons who use social engineering methods to influence the
   behavior of a SP's personnel.

o  Users of the MPLS-TP network itself.

o  Others, e.g., attackers from the other sources, including the 
   Internet if connected.

o  Other SPs in the case of MPLS-TP inter-provider connection.  The
   provider may or may not be using MPLS-TP.

o  Those who create, deliver, install, and maintain hardware or software 
   for network equipment.

   Given that security is generally a tradeoff between expense and risk,
it is also useful to consider the likelihood of different attacks
occurring.  There is at least a perceived difference in the
likelihood of most types of attacks being successfully mounted in
different environments, such as:

o  A MPLS-TP network inter-connecting with another provider's core

o  A MPLS-TP configuration transiting the public Internet

   Most types of attacks become easier to mount and hence more likely as
the shared infrastructure via which service is provided expands from
a single SP to multiple cooperating SPs to the global Internet.
Attacks that may not be of sufficient likeliness to warrant concern
in a closely controlled environment often merit defensive measures in
broader, more open environments.  Even though surveys show that 40% to 
60% of attacks originate from insiders,  in closed communities, it is 
often practical to deal with misbehavior after the fact: an employee can 
be disciplined, for example.

Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP Security Framework           October 2011


   The following sections discuss specific types of exploits that
threaten MPLS-TP networks.

4.1.  Attacks on the Control Plane

o  MPLS-TP LSP creation by an unauthorized element

o  LSP message interception

o  Attacks on G-Ach

o  Attacks against LDP

o  Attacks against RSVP-TE

o  Attacks against GMPLS

o  Denial of Service Attacks on the Network Infrastructure

o  Attacks on the SP's MPLS/GMPLS Equipment via Management Interfaces

o  Social Engineering Attacks on the SP's Infrastructure

o  Cross-Connection of Traffic between Users

o  Attacks against Routing Protocols

o  Other Attacks on Control Traffic

4.2.  Attacks on the Data Plane

   This category encompasses attacks on the provider's or end user's
data.  Note that from the MPLS-TP network end user's point of view,
some of this might be control plane traffic, e.g. routing protocols
running from user site A to user site B via IP or non-IP connections,
which may be some type of VPN.

o  Unauthorized Observation of Data Traffic

o  Modification of Data Traffic

o  Insertion of Inauthentic Data Traffic: Spoofing and Replay

o  Unauthorized Deletion of Data Traffic

o  Unauthorized Traffic Pattern Analysis

5.  Defensive Techniques for MPLS-TP Networks

   The defensive techniques discussed in this document are intended to
describe methods by which some security threats can be addressed. They 
are not intended as requirements for all MPLS-TP implementations.  The 
specific operational environment determines the security requirements 
for any instance of MPLS-TP.  Therefore, protocol designers should 
provide a full set of security capabilities, which can be selected and 
used where appropriate. The MPLS-TP provider should determine the 
applicability of these techniques to the provider's specific service 
offerings, and the end user may wish to assess the value of these 
techniques to the user's service requirements.  

   The techniques discussed here include entity authentication for 
identity verification, encryption for confidentiality, message integrity 
and replay detection to ensure the validity of message streams, network-
based access controls such as packet filtering and firewalls, host-based 
access controls, isolation, aggregation, and event logging. Where these 
techniques apply to MPLS and GMPLS in general, they are described in 
Section 5.2 of [RFC5920]. The remainder of this section covers aspects 
that apply particularly to MPLS-TP.

5.1.  Authentication

   To prevent security issues arising from impersonation, masquerade, or 
some DoS attacks or from malicious or accidental misconfiguration, it is 
critical that MPLS-TP devices should accept connections or control 
messages only from known sources.  Authentication refers to methods for 
ensuring that the identities of message sources are properly verified by 
the MPLS-TP devices with which they communicate.  This section focuses 
on scenarios in which sender authentication is required and recommends
authentication mechanisms for these scenarios.

5.1.1.  Management System Authentication

   Management system authentication includes the authentication of a PE
to a centrally-managed network management or directory server when
directory-based "auto-discovery" is used.  It also includes
authentication of a CE to the configuration server, when a
configuration server system is used.

This type of authentication should be bi-directional. The PE or CE needs 
to be certain it is communicating with the right server.

5.1.2.  Peer-to-Peer Authentication

   Peer-to-peer authentication includes peer authentication for network
control protocols and other peer authentication (e.g., authentication
of one IPsec security gateway by another).

   Authentication should be bi-directional, including S-PE, T-PE, PE or
CE to configuration server authentication for PE or CE to be certain it 
is communicating with the right server.

5.1.3.  Cryptographic Techniques for Authenticating Identity

   Cryptographic techniques offer several mechanisms for authenticating
the identity of devices or individuals.  These include the use of
shared secret keys, one-time keys generated by accessory devices or
software, user-ID and password pairs, and a variety of public-private
key systems.  Some of these use digital certificates binding a user's 
name and public key. One method of using digital certificates is within 
a hierarchical Certification Authority system.

5.2.  Access Control Techniques

Many of the security issues related to management interfaces can be
addressed through the use of authentication as described in Section 
5.1. However, additional security may be provided by controlling access 
to management interfaces or to specific resources with an access control 
model. In addition to identification and authentication, access control 
deals with authorization.

Much of the work on security for SNMP has focused on access control 
models. For the most recent version of SNMP security, see the work of 
the ISMS WG.

   The Optical Internetworking Forum has done relevant work on
Protecting interfaces to management systems with TLS, SSH, IPsec, WSS, 
etc. See Security for Management Interfaces to Network Elements 
[OIF-SMI-01.0], and Addendum to the Security for Management Interfaces 
to Network Elements [OIF-SMI-02.1].

   Management interfaces, especially console ports on MPLS-TP devices,
may be configured so they are only accessible out-of-band, through a
system which is physically or logically separated from the rest of
the MPLS-TP infrastructure.

   Where management interfaces are accessible in-band within the MPLS-TP
domain, filtering or firewalling techniques can be used to restrict
unauthorized in-band traffic from having access to management
interfaces.  Depending on device capabilities, these filtering or
firewalling techniques can be configured either on other devices
through which the traffic might pass, or on the individual MPLS-TP
devices themselves.

5.3.  Use of Isolated Infrastructure

   One way to protect the infrastructure used for support of MPLS-TP is
to separate the resources for support of MPLS-TP services from the
resources used for other purposes.

5.4.  Use of Aggregated Infrastructure

   In general, it is not feasible to use a completely separate set of
resources for support of each service.  In fact, one of the main
reasons for MPLS-TP enabled services is to allow sharing of resources
between multiple services and multiple users.  Thus, even if certain
services use a separate network from Internet services, nonetheless
there will still be multiple MPLS-TP users sharing the same network
resources.

   In general, the use of aggregated infrastructure allows the service
provider to benefit from stochastic multiplexing of multiple bursty
flows, and also may in some cases thwart traffic pattern analysis by
combining the data from multiple users.  However, service providers
must minimize security risks introduced from any individual service
or individual users.

5.5.  Service Provider Quality Control Processes

5.6.  Verification of Connectivity

To protect against deliberate or accidental misconnection,
mechanisms can be put in place to verify both end-to-end connectivity
and hop-by-hop resources.  These mechanisms can trace the routes of
LSPs in both the control plane and the data plane.

6.  Monitoring, Detection, and Reporting of Security Attacks

   MPLS-TP networks and services may be subject to attacks from a 
variety of security threats.  Many types of threats are described 
in the Security Requirements (Section 3) Section of this document. 
The defensive techniques described in this document and elsewhere 
provide significant levels of protection from many of these threats.
However, in addition to employing defensive techniques silently to 
protect against attacks, MPLS-TP services can also add value for 
both providers and customers by implementing security monitoring 
systems to detect and report on any security attacks, regardless 
of whether the attacks are effective.

   Attackers often begin by probing and analyzing defenses, so systems
that can detect and properly report these early stages of attacks can 
provide significant benefits.

Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP Security Framework           October 2011

   Information concerning attack incidents, especially if available
quickly, can be useful in defending against further attacks.  It can
be used to help identify attackers or their specific targets at an
early stage.  This knowledge about attackers and targets can be used
to strengthen defenses against specific attacks or attackers, or to
improve the defenses for specific targets on an as-needed basis.
Information collected on attacks may also be useful in identifying
and developing defenses against novel attack types.

Also, extensive logging of normal processing, error conditions and 
security events can be an invaluable source of information for tracking 
down attacks, recovering from them, and determining how to prevent 
future attacks. Different methods may be appropriate from case to case, 
and in fact comparing the same or similar information obtained in 
different ways (e.g., with syslog and SNMP) has sometimes reveals subtle 
security flaws or actual intrusions. Implementations should also pay 
attention to the security of the logs themselves.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations constitute the sole subject of this document
and hence are discussed throughout.

   The document describes a variety of defensive techniques that may be
used to counter the potential threats.  All of the techniques
presented involve mature and widely implemented technologies that are
practical to implement.

   The document evaluates MPLS-TP security requirements from a
customer's perspective as well as from a service provider's
perspective.  These sections re-evaluate the identified threats from
the perspectives of the various stakeholders and are meant to assist
equipment vendors and service providers, who must ultimately decide
what threats to protect against in any given configuration or service
offering.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no new IANA considerations.
