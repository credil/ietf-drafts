                  RADIUS Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent
                  draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-radius-opt-11

Abstract

   The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a mechanism to exchange
   authorization and identification information between the DHCPv6 relay
   agent and the DHCPv6 server.  This mechanism is meant for the
   centralized DHCPv6 server to select the right configuration for the
   requesting DHCPv6 client based on the authorization information
   received from the RADIUS server, which is not co-located with the
   DHCPv6 server.  The Network Access Server (NAS) acts as DHCPv6 relay
   agent and RADIUS client simultaneously in this document.

Internet-Draft            DHCPv6 RADIUS Option                April 2013


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 provides a mechanism that allows the server to assign or
   delegate both stateful and stateless configuration parameters to the
   clients.  The stateful configuration parameters include IPv6 address
   [RFC3315] and IPv6 prefix [RFC3633].  The stateless configuration
   parameters [RFC3736] include, for example, DNS [RFC3646], or a FQDN
   of AFTR [RFC6334].  In the scenarios described in this document, the
   DHCPv6 server is deployed in the central part of an ISP network.

   RADIUS [RFC2865] is widely used as the centralized authentication,
   authorization and user management mechanism for the service provision
   in Broadband access network.  [RFC3162], [RFC4818], [RFC6519] and
   [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access] specified attributes that support the
   service provision for IPv6-only and IPv6-transition access.  RADIUS
   server authorizes the Network Access Server (NAS) to assign an IPv6
   address or prefix from the indicated pool, or to assign an IPv6
   address or prefix with an explicitly indicated value, and other
   configuration parameters as per the attributes for the subscribers.

   These mechanisms work well in the deployment scenarios where the NAS
   acts as the distributed DHCPv6 server.  In that case the NAS directly
   responds the DHCPv6 messages as per the indication conveyed by the
   attributes in the Access-Accept message from the RADIUS server.
   These mechanisms might also work well in the scenario where the
   centralized DHCPv6 server is co-located with the RADIUS server, where
   they can share the same database of the users.  But when the NAS acts
   as the relay agent and RADIUS client simultaneously, and the
   centralized DHCPv6 server is not located in the same place as the
   RADIUS server, a new communication mechanism is needed for the relay
   agent to transfer the authorization information indicated by the
   RADIUS attributes to the DHCPv6 server.


2.  Terminology and Language

   This document specifies a new DHCPv6 option for the DHCPv6 Relay
   Agent to transfer the authorization information of RADIUS attributes
   received in the Access-Accept message from the RADIUS server to the
   centralized DHCPv6 server.  Definitions for terms and acronyms not
   specified in this document are defined in [RFC2865] and [RFC3315].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Network Scenarios

   Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the typical network scenarios where the
   communication mechanism introduced in this document is necessary.  In
   these scenarios, the centralized DHCPv6 server is not co-located with
   the RADIUS server, but both of them are in the same administrative
   domain.  The NAS acts as the DHCPv6 relay agent and the RADIUS client
   simultaneously.  Figure 1 shows the sequence of DHCPv6 and RADIUS
   messages for IP over Ethernet (IPoE) access model, when the access
   loop adopts the direct Ethernet encapsulation.  Figure 2 shows the
   sequence of DHCPv6 and RADIUS messages for PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE)
   access model.

   The mechanism introduced in this document is a generic mechanism, and
   might also be employed in other network scenarios where the DHCPv6
   relay agent and the RADIUS client locate in the same device.

   If the authentication or the authorization through RADIUS fails, the
   associated message sequences will stop.  The NAS acting as the DHCPv6
   relay agent will not forward the message received from the client to
   the DHCPv6 server.  If the authentication or the authorization
   through RADIUS passes, the NAS MUST store the information indicated

   in the RADIUS attributes received in the Access-Accept message from
   the RADIUS server during the whole session.  How the NAS manages
   these information during the RADIUS session is out of the scope of
   this document.

   After receiving RENEW (5) message from the DHCPv6 client, the NAS
   SHOULD NOT initiate a new Access-Request/Access-Accept message
   exchange with the RADIUS server; but after receiving REBIND (6)
   message from the DHCPv6 client, the NAS SHOULD initiate a new Access-
   Request/Access-Accept message exchange with the RADIUS server.


4.  DHCPv6 RADIUS option

   The OPTION_RADIUS is a DHCPv6 option used by the DHCPv6 relay agent
   to carry the authorization information of RADIUS attributes received
   in the Access-Accept message from the RADIUS server.

   The format of the OPTION_RADIUS option is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   option-len       Length of the option-data in octets
   option-data      List of one or more RADIUS attributes

   The option-data of OPTION_RADIUS is a list of one or more RADIUS
   attributes received in the Access-Accept message from the RADIUS
   server.  The OPTION_RADIUS can only contain the RADIUS attributes
   listed in the IANA Registry of 'RADIUS attributes permitted in DHCPv6
   RADIUS option'.

   According to the network scenarios described in section 3, the
   OPTION_RADIUS SHOULD appear in the RELAY-FORW (12) message relaying
   SOLICIT (1), REQUEST (3) and REBIND (6) from the DHCPv6 client, and
   MAY appear in the RELAY-FORW (12) relaying any other message from the
   DHCPv6 client.

   Note: The RADIUS attribute's 'Length' defined in section 5 of
   [RFC2865] includes the length of 'Type' and 'Length' fields.


5.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior

   The DHCPv6 relay agent MAY include OPTION_RADIUS in the RELAY-FORW
   (12) message.  When the value in the attributes, for example,
   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool (171), Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool (172),
   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix (123) or Framed-IPv6-Address (168) in the
   Access-Accept message replied from RADIUS server are valid, the relay
   agent that supports OPTION_RADIUS SHOULD include these RADIUS
   attributes into the OPTION_RADIUS one by one.


6.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Upon receipt of the RELAY-FORW (12) message with OPTION_RADIUS from a
   relay agent, the DHCPv6 server that supports OPTION_RADIUS SHOULD
   extract and interpret the RADIUS attributes in the OPTION_RADIUS, and
   use that information in selecting configuration parameters for the
   requesting client.  If the DHCPv6 server does not support
   OPTION_RADIUS, the DHCPv6 server MUST silently discard this option.


7.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   OPTION_RADIUS is only exchanged between the relay agents and the
   servers.  DHCPv6 clients are not aware of the usage of OPTION_RADIUS.
   DHCPv6 client MUST NOT send OPTION_RADIUS, and MUST ignore
   OPTION_RADIUS if received.


8.  Security Considerations

   Known security vulnerabilities of the DHCPv6 and RADIUS protocol may

   apply to its options.  Security issues related with DHCPv6 are
   described in section 23 of [RFC3315].  Security issues related with
   RADIUS are described in section 8 of [RFC2865], section 5 of
   [RFC3162].

   The mechanism described in this document may introduce new attack
   vector against the DHCPv6 server in case the DHCPv6 relay agent is
   compromised.  By forging the RADIUS attributes contained in the
   OPTION_RADIUS of the RELAY-FORW (12) messages, the attacker may
   influence the parameter assignment on the DHCPv6 server for the
   DHCPv6 clients.  However, in the network scenarios described in the
   section 3, NAS could always be regarded as a trusted network
   component in the real deployment.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests to assign a new DHCPv6 option code for
   OPTION_RADIUS defined in section 4, and to create a new registry on
   the same assignment page, which is entitled as 'RADIUS attributes
   permitted in DHCPv6 RADIUS option' defined in section 4.1.  The new
   registry will enumerate the RADIUS Attributes Types
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types/radius-types.xml) that
   are permitted to be included in the DHCPv6 RADIUS option.  New RADIUS
   attributes MAY be added to this list after the IETF Expert Review
   [RFC5226].  The IETF expert review SHOULD include careful
   consideration of the security implications of allowing the relay
   agent to include the RADIUS attribute being considered for addition
   to this registry.
