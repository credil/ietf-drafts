    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an RTCP XR Report Block that allows the
      reporting of Loss Concealment metrics primarily for audio applications
      of RTP.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <section title="Loss Concealment Report Block">
        <t>This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
        [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.</t>

        <t>At any instant, the audio output at a receiver may be classified as
        either 'normal' or 'concealed'. 'Normal' refers to playout of audio
        payload received from the remote end, and also includes locally
        generated signals such as announcements, tones and comfort noise.
        Concealment refers to playout of locally-generated signals used to
        mask the impact of network impairments or to reduce the audibility of
        jitter buffer adaptations.</t>

        <t>The new block type provides metrics for actions taken by the
        receiver to mitigate the effect of packet loss and packet discard.
        Specifically, the first metric (On-Time Playout Duration) reports the
        duration of normal playout of data which the receiver obtained from
        the sender's stream. A second metric (Loss Concealment Duration)
        reports the total time during which the receiver played out media data
        which was manufactured locally, because the sender's data for these
        periods was not available due to packet loss or discard. A similar
        metric (Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration) reports the duration
        of playout of locally-manufactured data replacing data which is
        unavailable due to adaptation of an adaptive de-jitter buffer. Further
        metrics (Playout Interrupt Count and Mean Playout Interrupt Size)
        report the number of times normal playout was interrupted, and the
        mean duration of these interruptions.</t>

        <t>Loss Concealment Duration and Buffer Adjustment Concealment
        Duration are reported separately because buffer adjustment is
        typically arranged to occur in silence periods so may have very little
        impact on user experience, whilst loss concealment may occur at any
        time.</t>

        <t>The metric belongs to the class of transport-related terminal
        metrics defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defined an
        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This draft defines a new Extended Report block that MUST be used as
        defined in <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Architectures <xref
        target="MONARCH"></xref> provides guideline for reporting block format
        using RTCP XR. The Metrics Block described in this document are in
        accordance with the guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref> and
        <xref target="MONARCH"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>This metric is primarily applicable to audio applications of RTP.

        for video?</t>

            <t hangText="Block type (BT): 8 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />A
            Loss Concealment Metrics Report Block is identified by the

            replace NLC with the IANA provided RTCP XR block type for this
            block.] <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />This field is used to indicate whether the Delay
            metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is,
            whether the reported values applies to the most recent measurement
            interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=10) (the
            Interval Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
            cumulative measurements (I=11) (the Cumulative Duration) or is a
            sampled instantaneous value (I=01) (Sampled Value). <vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Packet Loss Concealment Method (plc): 2 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />This field is used to identify the packet loss
            concealment method in use at the receiver, according to the
            following code: <list>
                <t>bits 014-015<list>
                    <t>0 = silence insertion</t>

                    <t>1 = simple replay, no attenuation</t>

                    <t>2 = simple replay, with attenuation</t>

                    <t>3 = enhanced</t>

                    <t>Other values reserved</t>
                  </list></t>
              </list><vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Reserved (resv): 4 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />These bits are reserved. They SHOULD be set to
            zero by senders and MUST be ignored by receivers.<vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="block length: 16 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" /> The
            length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one. For the
            Delay block, the block length is equal to 5.<vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="SSRC of source: 32 bits"><vspace blankLines="1" />As
            defined in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.<vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="On-time Playout Duration (ms): 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />'On-time' playout is the uninterrupted,
            in-sequence playout of valid decoded audio information originating
            from the remote endpoint. This includes comfort noise during
            periods of remote talker silence, if VAD is used, and locally
            generated or regenerated tones and announcements. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />An equivalent definition is that on-time playout
            is playout of any signal other than those used for concealment.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />On-time playout duration MUST include
            both speech and silence intervals, whether VAD is used or not.
            This duration is reported in millisecond units.</t>

            <t>If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
            SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the
            measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF SHOULD be
            reported. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Loss Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout
            corresponding to Loss-type concealment. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Loss-type concealment is reactive insertion or
            deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to effective
            frame loss at the audio decoder. "Effective frame loss" is the
            event in which a frame of coded audio is simply not present at the
            audio decoder when required. In this case, substitute audio
            samples are generally formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to
            reduce audible impairment. <vspace blankLines="1" />If the
            measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE SHOULD be
            reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the measurement
            is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF SHOULD be reported. <vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t
            hangText="Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout
            corresponding to Buffer Adjustment-type concealment, if known.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD,
            the value 0xFFFFFFFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range
            measurement. If the measurement is unavailable, the value
            0xFFFFFFFF SHOULD be reported. <vspace blankLines="1" />Buffer
            Adjustment-type concealment is proactive or controlled insertion
            or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to jitter
            buffer adaptation, re-sizing or re-centering decisions within the
            endpoint. <vspace blankLines="1" />Because this insertion is
            controlled, rather than occurring randomly in response to losses,
            it is typically less audible than loss-type concealment. For
            example, jitter buffer adaptation events may be constrained to
            occur during periods of talker silence, in which case only silence
            duration is affected, or sophisticated time-stretching methods for
            insertion/deletion during favorable periods in active speech may
            be employed. <vspace blankLines="1" />Concealment events which
            cannot be classified as Buffer Adjustment- type MUST be classified
            as Loss-type. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Playout Interrupt Count: 16 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The number of interruptions to normal playout
            which occurred during the reporting period. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
            0xFFFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.
            If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be
            reported. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Mean Playout Interrupt Size (ms): 16 bits"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />The mean duration, in ms, of interruptions to
            normal playout which occurred during the reporting period. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
            0xFFFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.
            If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be

            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
