                  IPv6 RA Options for  Next Hop Routes
                   draft-sarikaya-6man-rfc4191bis-00

Abstract

   This proposes an update on RFC 4191 in order to define new Router
   Advertisement options for configuring next hop routes on the mobile
   or fixed nodes.  Using these options, an operator can easily
   configure nodes with multiple interfaces (or otherwise multi-homed)
   to enable them to select the routes to a destination.  Each option is
   defined together with definitions of host and router behaviors.

Internet-Draft               New RA Options                    July 2013


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   protocols can be used to configure fixed and mobile nodes with
   various parameters related to addressing and routing [RFC4861],
   [RFC4862], [RFC4191].  DNS Recursive Server Addresses and Domain Name
   Search Lists are additional parameters that can be configured using
   router advertisements [RFC6106].

   Router Advertisements can also be used to configure fixed and mobile
   nodes in multi-homed scenarios with route information and next hop
   address.  Different scenarios exist such as the node is
   simultaneously connected to multiple access network of e.g.  WiFi and
   3G. The node may also be connected to more than one gateway.  Such
   connectivity may be realized by means of dedicated physical or
   logical links that may also be shared with other users nodes such as
   in residential access networks.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               New RA Options                    July 2013


3.  Default Route Configuration

   A host, usually a mobile host interested in obtaining routing
   information usually sends a Router Solicitation (RS) message on the
   link.  The router, when configured to do so, provides the route
   information using zero, one or more Next Hop Address and Route
   Information options in the router advertisement (RA) messages sent in
   response.

   The route options are extensible, as well as convey detailed
   information for routes.

   RS and RA exchange is for next hop address and route information
   determination and not for determining the link-layer address of the
   router.  Subsequent Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement
   exchange can be used to determine link-layer address of the router.

   It should be noted that the proposed options in this document will
   need a central site-wide configuration mechanism.  The required
   values can not automatically be derived from routing tables.

   Next hop address and related route information may be provided by
   some other means such as directly by the next hop routers.  In this
   document we assume that next hop routers are not able to provide this
   information.  One solution would be to develop an inter-router
   protocol to instigate the next hop routers to provide this
   information.  However, such a solution has been singled out due to
   the complexities involved.

   A non-trustworthy network may be available at the same time as a
   trustworthy network, with the risk of bad consequences if the host
   gets confused between the two.  These are basically the two models
   for hosts with multiple interfaces, both of which are valid, but
   which are incompatible with each other.  In the first model, an
   interface is connected to something like a corporate network, over a
   Virtual Private Network (VPN).  This connection is trusted because it
   has been authenticated.  Routes obtained over such a connection can
   probably be trusted, and indeed it may be important to use those
   routes.  This is because in the VPN case, you may also be connected
   to a network that's offered you a default route, and you could be
   attacked over that connection if you attempt to connect to resources
   on the enterprise network over it.

   On the other, non-trustworthy network scenario, none of the networks
   to which the host is connected are meaningfully more or less
   trustworthy.  In this scenario, the untrustworthy network may hand
   out routes to other hosts, e.g. those in the VPN going through some
   malicious nodes.  This will have bad consequences because the host's

   traffic intended for the corporate VPN may be hijacked by the
   intermediate nodes.

   Router advertisement extensions described in this document can be
   used to install the routes.  However, the use of such a technique
   makes sense only in the former case above, i.e. trusted network.  So
   the host MUST have an authenticated connection to the network it
   connects so that the router advertisements can be trusted before
   establishing routes.


4.  Source Address Dependent Routing

   In multihomed networks there is a need to do source address based
   routing if some providers are performing the ingress filtering
   defined in BCP38 [RFC2827].  This requires the routers to consider
   the source addresses as well as the destination addresses in
   determining the next hop to send the packet to.

   The routers may be informed about the source addresses to use in
   routing using extensions to the routing protocols like IS-IS defined
   in [ISO.10589.1992] [I-D.baker-ipv6-isis-dst-src-routing] and OSPF
   defined in [RFC5340] [I-D.baker-ipv6-ospf-dst-src-routing].  In this
   document we define the router advertisement extensions for source
   address dependent routing.

   Routing protocol extensions for source address dependent routing does
   not avoid a host using a source address that may be subject to
   ingress filtering when sending a packet to one of the next hops.  In
   that case the host receives an ICMP source address failed ingress/
   egress policy eroor message in which case the host must resend the
   packet trying a different source address.  The extensions defined in
   this document aims at avoiding this inefficiency in packet forwarding
   at the host.


5.  Host Configuration

   Router advertisement options defined in this document are used by
   Type C hosts.

   As defined in [RFC4191] Type C host uses a Routing Table instead of a
   Default Router List.

   The hosts set up their routing tables based on the router
   advertisement extensions defined in this document.The routes
   established are used in forwarding the packets to a next hop based on
   the destination prefix/address using the longest match algorithm.

   In case the host receives Next Hop Address with Source Address and
   Route Prefix option, the host uses source and destination prefix/
   address using the longest match algorithm in order to select the next
   hop to forward the packet to.


6.  Router Configuration

   The router MAY send one or more Next Hop Address options that specify
   the IPv6 next hop addresses.  Each Next Hop Address option may be
   associated with zero, one or more Route Prefix options that represent
   the IPv6 destination prefixes reachable via the given next hop.
   Router includes Route Prefix option in message to indicate that given
   prefix is available directly on- link.

   Router MAY send a single Next Hop Address without any Route Prefix
   options.  When router sends Next Hop Address option that is
   associated with Router Prefix option, the router MUST use Next Hop
   and Route Prefix option defined in Section 11.  The Route Prefix MAY
   contain ::/0, i.e. with Prefix Length set to zero to indicate
   available default route.

   The router MAY send one or more Next Hop Address options that specify
   the IPv6 next hop addresses and source address.  Each Next Hop
   Address option may be associated with zero, one or more Source
   Address options that represent the source addresses that are assigned
   from the prefixes that belong to this next hop defined in Section 13.
   In addition, the option MAY contain Route Prefix options that
   represent the IPv6 destination prefixes reachable via the given next
   hop.  Router includes Source Address option and Route Prefix option
   in the message to indicate that given prefix is available directly
   on- link and that the source address will not be subject to ingress
   filtering.

   The router MAY send one or more Next Hop Address options that specify
   the IPv6 next hop addresses and source address.  Each Next Hop
   Address option may be associated with zero, one or more Source Prefix
   options that represent the source addresses that are assigned from
   the prefixes that belong to this next hop defined in Section 12.  In
   addition, the option MAY contain Route Prefix options that represent
   the IPv6 destination prefixes reachable via the given next hop.
   Router includes Source Prefix option and Route Prefix option in the
   message to indicate that given prefix is available directly on- link
   and that any source addresses derived from the source prefix will not
   be subject to ingress filtering on these routes supported by these
   next hops.

14.  Security Considerations

   Neighbor Discovery is subject to attacks that cause IP packets to
   flow to unexpected places.  Because of this, neighbor discovery
   messages MUST be secured, possibly using Secure Neighbor Discovery
   (SEND) protocol [RFC3971].


15.  IANA Considerations

   Authors of this document request IANA to assign the following new RA
   options:
