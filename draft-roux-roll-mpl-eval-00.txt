          Preliminary results about MPL performance evaluation
                    draft-roux-roll-mpl-eval-00.txt

Abstract

   This draft presents simulation work and first results related to MPL
   performance evaluation.  The simulation makes it possible to evaluate
   MPL performances in the context of a large network.  The simulated
   network introduces 500 nodes.  The general principles of the
   simulator are described.  Then reference settings are introduced, and
   evaluation indicators are proposed.  Finally preliminary results are
   presented under the form of a few tables, that show the proposed
   indicator values depending on some specific parameter which is used
   as a variable argument.  Among various results, the advantage of
   using reactive mode for MPL is shown in terms of the capability to
   maintain loss free diffusion in harsh radio conditions.

1.  Introduction

   The RPL protocol is an IPv6 protocol for low-power and lossy
   networks, defined in [RFC6550].

   The [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast] draft introduces the so called MPL
   algorithm, with a lot of freedom in terms of possible configuration.
   The current draft is a preliminary attempt to provide guidance for
   finding good algorithm settings for MPL.

   Simulation makes it possible to address algorithmic capabilities in
   terms of scalability.  A network made of 500 nodes is considered in
   this document.  The proposed objective is to assess performance of
   the MPL protocol in such large networks, and to compare various MPL
   settings, in order to understand their influence on performances, so
   that setting guidelines may be derived.

   However, the presented results are still not mature enough to propose
   solid and motivated guidelines.  This draft should be considered as a
   preliminary attempt in this direction.  Depending on the feedback, a
   more complete set of results may be presented in the coming months.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Simulated Network Layout

   A reference network layout has been assumed for all simulations.  It
   is composed of 500 nodes randomly distributed within a rectangular
   area, excluding a void sub-area in its center, as shown in Figure 1.
   The main area width is 20 km and the height is 10 km.  The void sub-
   area is 2 km and its height is 5 km.  The layout is built by dropping
   nodes randomly in the main area.  Once a potential node has been
   dropped at a random location in the main area, it is retained only if
   it is not located in the void sub-area, and if its closest neighbour
   among previously defined nodes, is not closer than 20 meters.  This
   process continues until 500 nodes has been retained in the area.
   Then the closest node to the point of coordinates (x=2km,y=5km) is
   selected as the seed node.

4.  Simulator Principle

   The simulator elementary time step has been set in such a way that it
   takes 4 elementary steps for a sender to send the longest messages,
   which are supposed not to exceed 128 bytes.  The simulator doesn't
   address anything below this time step.  As an example the simulator
   doesn't actually fill messages with bits.

   At each elementary step, the simulator spans each node in the network
   several times in order to:

   o  Check data trickle timers and control trickle timer (if one
      exists).

   o  Treat incoming messages.

   o  Take care of (data or control) message transmission (start,
      continue or complete a message transmission).


5.  Radio Simulation Aspects

   As said above, only a fragment of a message can be transmitted during
   an elementary time step of the simulator.  The term of fragment, as
   used in this document, refers to the part of a message which can be
   transmitted during an elementary simulator step time.

   The radio coverage radius if set to 100m, which means that beyond
   this distance, no fragment can be transmitted between 2 nodes.  Below
   this distance, there is a probability for a transmitted fragment to
   be received which depends on the simulated power received at the
   receiver.

   The static attenuation in dB is assumed to be equal to 50 +
   30.log10(d/50), with d in meters, which means that we assume 3 as the

   path loss exponent.  A log normal shadowing with 3 dB as standard
   deviation is added as a dynamical attenuation.  Dynamical attenuation
   spectrum is limited with a 3 Hz cut off frequency.

   A fragment being sent may not be received (or corrupted) at the
   receiver depending on a probability which is bound to the received
   level at the receiver at the receiving time.  A predefined table
   defines the probability for a fragment to be received depending on
   the received power.

   For a message to be transmitted between a sender and a receiver it is
   necessary that all segments involved in the message are received
   uncorrupted.  Otherwise, the message is assumed to be lost (because
   of the UDP checksum mechanism, it is assumed that a message received
   corrupted is also a non delivered UDP message).  If any segment has
   been lost then the message is lost as well.

   Collisions are simulated as well: if a receiver receives fragments
   from multiples neighbour nodes under its coverage, then a collision
   may occur for the received fragment.  For a message to be delivered,
   it is necessary that no collision occurs on any fragment of this
   message.  A collision condition occurs if the received power from a
   first neighbour is interfered with the received power from one or a
   set of other neighbours which a total interfering power which is
   equal at least to half the useful received power from the first
   neighbour.

   following parameter values:

                                  Table 2

   With respect to expansion figures, there is no claim about any
   generic properties for the results which are presented in this
   document.  Given the present definitions, it is expected that the
   denser is the network (in terms of average number of neighbours per
   node) the lower expansions rates will be.  Therefore expansion rates
   are not only depending on the routing algorithmic aspects, they also
   depend on the network layout.  Their interest in the context of this
   document is to compare different configuration settings, rather than
   to obtain generic performance indicators.

7.1.  Preliminary Results with Respect to Achievable Data Rate

   | Reactive data loss ratio              | 0.38 | 0.2  | 0.02 | 0    |
   | Reactive data expansion               | 0.36 | 0.91 | 1.58 | 1.93 |
   | Reactive control expansion            | 0.1  | 0.22 | 0.44 | 0.72 |
   | Reactive total expansion              | 0.46 | 1.13 | 2.02 | 2.65 |

         Preliminary results with respect to achievable data rates

                                  Table 3

   Table 3 provides results for several message rates at the seed.  It
   can be seen that a saturation phenomenon is observed (introducing
   significant message loss ratios) when the message rate is too high.
   Of course, this result is strongly related to the DATA_MESSAGE_IMIN
   and CONTROL_MESSAGE_IMIN parameters, which have both been set in this
   case to 1.28 s.

   The other observation seems to be that the reactive mode introduces
   more transmissions in the network (higher total expansion), with no
   real benefit in terms of achievable message rate given the
   constraints of negligible message loss ratios.

                                  Table 5

   Table 4 shows the effect of redundancy constant of trickle timers on
   data expansion, in case of proactive mode.  The other configuration
   parameters are set as described in the simulation conditions section.
   In particular, the message rate is 1 message for 4s, so that there
   are not message losses in any simulation.  With no surprise, it can
   be observed that the redundancy constant has a strong influence on
   expansion ratio.

   Table 5 shows the same result with respect to proactive mode.  It
   shows that expansion figures are higher when reactive mode is used,
   as compared to proactive mode.  The influence of introducing vlues
   that are different of 1 for CONTROL_MESSAGE_K will be studied later.

   Table 6 shows the effect of varying the transmit power.

   It shows the interest of using reactive mode has it is able to
   achieve lower message loss ratios in harsh radio environments.  Of
