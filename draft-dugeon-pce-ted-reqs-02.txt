          Path Computation Element (PCE) Database Requirements
                      draft-dugeon-pce-ted-reqs-02

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced a
   set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation
   Element as a tool to help MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSP tunnels placement.
   In the PCE architecture, a main assumption has been done concerning
   the information that the PCE needs to perform its computation.  In a
   fist approach, the PCE embeds a Traffic Engineering Database (TED)
   containing all pertinent and suitable information regarding the
   network that is in the scope of a PCE.  Nevertheless, the TED
   requirements as well as the TED information have not yet been
   formalized.  In addition, some recent RFC (like the Backward
   Recursive Path Computation procedure or PCE Hierarchy) or WG draft
   (like draft-ietf-pce-stateful-pce ...) suffer from a lack of
   information in the TED, leading to a non optimal result or to some
   difficulties to deploy them.  This memo tries to identify some
   Database, at large, requirements for the PCE.  It is split in two
   main sections: the identification of the specific information to be
   stored in the PCE Database and how it may be populated.

1.  Problem Statement

   Looking to the different RFCs that describe the PCE architecture and
   in particular RFC 4655 [RFC4655], RFC 5440 [RFC5440], RFC 5441
   [RFC5441] and RFC 6805 [RFC6805], the Path Computation Element (PCE)
   needs to acquire a set of information that is usually store in the
   Traffic Engineering Database (TED) in order to perform its path
   computation.  Even if intra-domain topology acquisition is well
   documented and known (e.g. by listening to the IGP-TE protocol that
   runs inside the network), inter-domain topology information, PCE peer
   address, neighbor AS, existing MPLS-TE tunnels... that are necessary
   for the Global Concurrent Optimization, Backward Recursive Path
   Computation (BRPC) and the Hierarchical PCE are not documented and
   not completely standardized.

   The purpose of this memo is to inventory the required information
   that should be part of the PCE Database and the different mechanisms
   that allow an operator to populate it.

1.1.  PCE Assumption and Hypothesis

   In some cases, both the path computation and the Database operations
   are slightly coupled: border node identification, endpoint
   localization, TE-LSP learning and domain sequence selection... to
   name a few in which an IGP-based TED may not be sufficient.  It is
   also important to differentiate several environments with different
   requirements, especially for the multi-domain problem.  The PCE is
   scoped for any kind of network, from transmission networks (TDM/WDM)
   with a rather limited number of domains, few interconnections, and
   few confidentiality issues; transmission networks with a large number
   of domains; MPLS networks with several administrative domains; and
   big IP/MPLS networks with a large number of domains with peering
   agreements.  For each of them, a different solution for the multi-
   domain path computation may apply.  A solution may not be scalable
   for one, but perfectly suitable for another.

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                     July 2013


   Up to now, PCE WG has based its work and standard on the assumption
   and hypothesis that the TED contains all pertinent information
   suitable for the PCE to compute an optimal TE-LSP placement, over one
   or several domains a PCE has visibility on or over a set of PCE-
   capable domains (e.g. using BRPC procedure).  We could identify two
   major sources of information for the TED:

   o  The intra-domain routing protocol like OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE
      (including extensions for border links),

   o  The inter-domain routing protocol, i.e. BGP for the inter-AS case.

   If the first source gives a precise and synchronize view of the
   controlled network, BGP typically just provides network reachability
   with only one AS path (unless using recent add path option).
   Nevertheless, to optimize inter-domain path computation, route
   diversity and a minimum set of Traffic Engineering information about
   the foreign domains could be helpful.  Despite that it is possible to
   re-announce TE-LSP in the IGP-TE, the PCE needs also to have a
   precise knowledge of previous TE-LSP, not only for its stateful
   version [PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE]
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], but also when performing a global
   concurrent optimization RFC5557 [RFC5557] of the previous TE-LSPs
   place on a given domain.

   Another source of information, mainly static information can be the
   management plane, e.g. using SNMP, CLI... So, it is necessary to
   classify the source of information by their frequency of update:
   static or dynamic, e.g. a domain ID is unlikely to change, while
   unreserved bandwidth of a link may be continuously changing.

   In this document, PCE Database (PCED) is used not only to refer to
   the standard Traffic Engineering Database information, but is
   extended to all pertinent information e.g. it also contains previous
   TE-LSPs establish in the domain and sometimes referred as LSP DB in
   other documents.

1.2.  Terminology

   ABR: Area Border Routers.  Routers used to connect two IGP areas
   (areas in OSPF or levels in IS-IS).

   ASBR: Autonomous System Border Router.  Router used to connect
   together ASes of the same or different service providers via one or
   more inter-AS links.

   AS: Autonomous System

   Boundary Node (BN): a boundary node is either an ABR in the context
   of inter-area Traffic Engineering or an ASBR in the context of inter-
   AS Traffic Engineering.

   Domain: an Autonomous System

   Entry BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n-1) to domain(n) along
   a determined sequence of domains.

   Exit BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n) to domain(n+1) along
   a determined sequence of domains.

   Inter-area TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an IGP area boundary.

   Inter-AS TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an AS boundary.

   Both OSPF-TE and IS-IS-TE are identified in this category.

   PCE: Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application, or
   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

   PCE(i) is a PCE with the scope of domain(i).

   PCED: Path Computation Element Database

   TED: Traffic Engineering Database.

2.  PCED Requirements

   This section made a first inventory of the main requirements of the
   PCED in term of information that the database should contains.

2.1.  Intra-Domain

   This section describes the Intra-domain information that are suitable
   for the PCE Database including both MPLS and GMPLS.

2.1.1.  MPLS

   A PCE is allowed to compute paths in one or several domains.  Such
   PCE MUST be aware of the precise details of the network topology (or
   topologies) in order to compute optimal TE-LSP placements.  The
   information needed in this case includes:

   o  List of Internal Nodes identified by a reachable address: All
      nodes of the networks that are not border node,



Dugeon, et al.          Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                     July 2013


   o  List of Internal Links that rely nodes (both internal and border
      nodes),

   o  Traffic Engineering information of the different links i.e.  RFC
      3630 [RFC3630] and RFC 5305 [RFC5305](with e.g. recent metric
      extensions proposal OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric
      Extensions [I-D.ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions])

   o  Traffic Engineering information with GMPLS extensions of the
      different links i.e. RFC 4203 [RFC4203] and RFC 5307 [RFC5307],

   o  Traffic Engineering information of the nodes.

   The information above mentioned is usually exchanged using the IGP-TE
   protocol (OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE).

2.1.2.  GMPLS

   To be provided later

2.2.  Inter-Domain

   A PCE can also be allowed to take part to inter-domain path
   computation (e.g in per-domain path computation, BRPC or H-PCE
   relationship).  Some inter-domain information is mandatory when
   operator intend to use the PCE to compute Inter-AS TE LSP path that
   cross domain boundary.  For that purpose, the PCED SHOULD contains
   all information that allow the PCE to determine the optimal inter-
   domain path for the TE-LSP computation, which includes:

   o  Border Nodes (BNs) of the foreign domain,

   o  Links between BN, i.e. links between BN (n) to BN (n+1), including
      Traffic Engineering information,

   o  Traffic Engineering performance between BN (n) to give performance
      indication on foreign domain n,

   o  PCE (i) peer address associated with the domain number of the
      foreign domain (i),

   RFC 5316 [RFC5316] for IS-IS and RFC 5392 [RFC5392] for OSPF help to
   provide required PCED information in the case of inter-domain.  PCED
   can also contain information about virtual links and abstract
   information.

2.3.  TE LSPs




Dugeon, et al.          Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                     July 2013


   For Stateful operation and Global Concurrent Optimization, the PCED
   should also contain information on TE-LSPs already enforce in the
   controlled domain.  If some TE-LSP tunnels could be re-announce in
   the IGP-TE, the PCE could not learn from the IGP-TE all details of
   all TE LSPs: if TE information is known, detail of the ERO is lost as
   well as initial QoS parameters.  The following information will be
   useful for the PCED to describe the TE-LSP:

   o  Explicit Route Object (ERO),

   o  End-points objects,

   o  Initial and actual Metric objects, including extend metrics such
      as delay, jitter loss,

   Recent PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   provide new PCEP message to convey these kind of information.
   However, this capacity could be used disregarding the behavior
   (stateless or stateful) of the PCE.

2.4.  Operational Information

   This part of the TED contains all others information pertinent for
   the PCE to compute TE LSP path but that are provided through the
   management system.

3.  PCED model

   This section propose a basic model to store pertinent information
   regarding the different source of information.

3.1.  Intra-domain

3.1.1.  MPLS

   For intra-domain, there is no need to specify a particular model or
   schema for the PCED.  Indeed, the model is directly based on the IGP-
   TE.  Of course there is a difference between IS-IS and OSPF, but TE
   Link state are more of less similar in term of conveyed information
   and database description.  No particular requirements are necessary
   as this stage.

3.1.2.  GMPLS

   To be provided later.

3.2.  Inter-domain




Dugeon, et al.          Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                     July 2013


   Contrary to intra-domain where the PCE known the exact details of the
   underlying network, it is not possible to achieve a similar detail
   level for the inter-domain.  And not only for scalability reasons,
   but mostly for confidentiality of the networks.  This memo propose a
   basic schema that allows PCE to known sufficient details about the
   foreign domain while keeping confidential the internal information.
   For this purpose, we propose to describe a domain as a "Grey-Box"
   with inputs and outputs that correspond to the Border Nodes (BNs).
   Then Grey-Boxes are interconnected through inter-domain links between
   the BNs.  Then, suitable performance indicators are given to cross
   the Grey-Boxes from an input BN to and output BN.  Figure below gives
   as example of such model.

             +----------------+          +----------------+
             |  Domain (i)    |          |  Domain (i+1)  |
   Inter     |                |  Inter   |               (BN)-- Inter
   Domain --(BN)              |  Domain  |                |     Domain
   Link      |              (BN)--------(BN)             (BN)-- Links
             |                |  Link    |                |
             +-----(BN)-------+          +----------------+
                    |
                    | Inter-domain Link

   Example of the representation of 2 domains with the Grey-Box model


   With such inter-domain information, a PCE could look into the
   different inter-domain path (as the sum of inter-domain links and
   Grey-Box crossing performances) and select the most suitable one
   regarding the PCReq.

   If the inter-domain links between BN that connect the Grey-Boxes
   description are covered (see section 2.2), it is not the case for the
   internal links between BNs inside the Grey-Box.

4.  PCED Population

   This section aims to provide best current practices when mechanisms
   are well-known and some hints when standard solutions exist to
   populate the PCE TED, and so give directions to extend them.  In
   particular, we aim at providing input on whether the TED gets the
   information from the routing protocol and how it gets it, which
   specific routing protocols are suited, whether it gets it from an
   NMS, at what frequency the TED is updated... and if it needs extra
   information.

4.1.  Intra-domain

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                     July 2013


4.1.1.  MPLS

   As the TED mainly contains the intra-domain topology graph, it is
   RECOMMENDED to link the PCE with the underlying IGP-TE (OSPF-TE or
   IS-IS-TE routing protocol).  By adding the PCE into the IGP-TE
   routing intra-domain, it is possible to listen to the routing
   protocol and then acquired the complete topology graph as well as let
   the PCE announce itself (see RFC5088 and RFC5089).  In addition, the
   TED will synchronize as fast as the routing protocol converges like
   any router in the domain.  Best current practices are also of
   interest when a PCE compute path that spawn to several area / region.
   In that case, the PCE must be aware of the topology details of each
   area / region and not only the backbone area / region 1 with the
   summary of stub area / region 2.

   In addition, management tools may be used to complement the topology
   graph provided by the routing protocol.

4.1.2.  GMPLS

   To be provided later.

4.2.  Inter-Domain

   If for inter-area aspect of the inter-domain, actual IGP-TE protocol
   provide the aforementioned information without any particular
   extension, this is not the case for the inter-as scenario.

   First of all, RFC 5316 or RFC 5392 MUST be activated in the IGP-TE
   (respectively in IS-IS-TE or OSPF-TE) in order to advertise TE
   information on the inter-domain links.  This give the advantage for
   the PCE to determine what could be feasible, during path computation,
   on the peering links.

   In MPLS, AS path and network reachability are obtained from BGP and
   routing tables.  However, it is not straightforward to collect route
   diversity or TE information (i.e. bandwidth, transit delay, packet
   loss ratio, jitter ...) on a foreign domain.  Right now, we have
   identified several methods, which have been tested to fill in the
   PCED with this kind of information:

   o  Use of the management plane;

   o  Use of the "North bound distribution of Link-State and TE
      Information using BGP" [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] proposal to
      exchange TE information about the foreign domain;

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                     July 2013


   o  Use of PCNtf message to convey, inside vendor attribute (but in an
      extended way), TE information of foreign domain between PCE

   As well as some potential alternative mechanisms that would need more
   standardization effort:

   o  A hierarchical TE that could help to advertise, at the AS level,
      TE information on an abstract/aggregate view of the foreign AS
      topology;

   o  A PCEP extension to convey such TE information to the foreign PCE.

4.2.1.  Information exchange

   The force of PCE is to be aware of the complete topology of the
   underlying network.  With such knowledge, it could place efficiently
   the tunnel even if it not follows the route computed by the routing
   protocol.  Same principles apply also for the inter-domain.  But, in
   the Internet today, BGP summarize the route and the PCE should not be
   aware of the route diversity.  In particular, it could not choose
   another AS path as the one selected and announced by BGP.  In such
   case, the PCE will not be sufficiently aware of the route diversity
   and could not selected the optimal AS path when computing an inter-
   domain LSP.  To avoid this and allows PCE known route diversity to
   reach a given foreign domain, the inter-domain information must be
   propagated between all PCEs without aggregation or summarization.  In
   summary, PCEs need to synchronize part of their Database i.e. the
   inter-domain ones.  Disregarding the protocol, two different
   solutions emerged to exchange inter-domain information:

   o  Direct Distribution: Exchange TE information using BGP is part of
      this case.  In this scenario, it is necessary to establish a BGP
      session between the different domains (whatever the platform used,
      a dedicated router, a PCE, another server ...).  In the hierarchal
      PCE scenario, operators that provide child PCE, agree to establish
      a relation with foreign domain that provides the parent PCE.  But,
      in BRPC, or in Hierarchical PCE where almost operators provide a
      parent PCE, BGP session must be establish between networks that
      have not necessary direct adjacency.  However, operators should
      not agree to accept relation from other's not directly attached to
      their network.  In addition, this scenario could conduct to
      establish a full mesh of BGP session between PCE which could lead
      into some scalability problems.

   o  Flooding Distribution: In this case, the inter-domain information
      are flood between all PCE so that each PCE is aware about all
      foreign domain capabilities.  This meets the requirement but
      doesn't provide the flexibility of BGP in term of filtering.

      Indeed, BGP allows through configuration to decide which
      information are announced and to whom.  As a per session relation,
      a given operator is not oblige to announce the same capabilities
      to its foreign domain.  With flooding distribution, where
      everybody redistribute what it has learned without modify it, it
      is not possible to specialize announcement based on foreign
      domain.

   So, the solution must provide the possibility to filter what is
   announce per foreign domain without authorized the summarization or
   aggregation while keeping a distributed relation between domains.  In
   addition, a domain is responsible about the Grey-Box announcement and
   the advertisement information must not be modified by intermediate
   PCE.

4.3.  TE-LSPs

   Up to know, the PCE could learn the tunnel already enforce in the
   controlled domain through dedicated NMS system.  Recent works on
   state full extensions for PCEP propose to add new messages in order
   to collect information on TE-LSPs from the PCCs.

4.4.  Operational information

   Most of the time operational information are provided through the
   management system of the operator, but some could be automatically
   discovered.  In particular, in intra-domain, PCCs and PCEs can
   discover automatically reachable PCEs (as well as computation
   domains) through the deployment of RFC 5088 [RFC5088], for OSPF-
   controlled networks, and RFC 5089 [RFC5089] for IS-IS controlled
   networks.  However, for the inter-PCE discovery at the inter-AS
   level, no mechanism has been standardized (unless ASes are owned by
   the same ISP).

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA for the moment.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

6.  Security Considerations

   Acquisition of information for the PCE TED is of course sensible from
   a security point of view, especially when acquiring information from
   others AS.  This section aims at providing best practices to prevent
   some security threat when the PCE try to acquire TED information.

6.1.  Intra-domain information

   Same security considerations must be applied to the PCE when it is
   connected to an IGP-TE protocol as the routing protocol itself.  Best
   practices observed and deployed by operators must also be taken into
   account when installing some PCEs.  Indeed, even when deployed as a
   standalone server, PCEs must be considered as a typical router from
   the IGP-TE perspective.  As a result, beyond OSPF or IS-IS
   themselves, the usual security rules must be applied, e.g. login/
   passwd, authentication/digest... to protect the connectivity.

6.2.  Inter-domain information

   Inter-domain relation and so information exchange are subject to high
   potential hijack and so need attention from the security point of
   view.  To avoid disclosing or expose confidential information that
   two operators would exchange to fill in the TEDs of their respective
   PCEs, the relation SHOULD be protected by standard cryptography
   mechanism.  E.g. using IPsec tunnel is RECOMMENDED to protect the
   connectivity between PCEs and the TED exchanges.

6.3.  Operational information

   All operational information like PCE peer addresses are generally
   added manually to the TED and so do not need any particular
   protection nor subject to security.  But, as this basic information
   is needed to connected the PCEs to their peers, it could potentially
   be associated to sensitive parameters like login and password.  So,
   standard Best Practices are RECOMMENDED to avoid basic security
   exposition.
