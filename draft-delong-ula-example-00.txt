           ULA IPv6 Address Prefix Reserved for Documentation
                       draft-delong-ula-example-00

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of this
   memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating
   documented examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 Unicast Address
   prefix is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation,
   and the like.

   Since the publication of [RFC 4193] (ULA), it is necessary to
   provide examples of ULA addresses in various documents, including
   some Internet-Drafts currently under consideration.

   This draft seeks to add ULA prefixes reserved for documentation
   purposes similar to the GUA reservation specified in [RFC3489]

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts. The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on September 29, 2013.

1. Introduction

   [RFC 4193] does not specify a ULA prefix to be used for
   documentation purposes. For the same reasons an IPv6 Global
   Unicast Prefix (GUA) is needed for documentation in [RFC 3849],
   there is also need for a ULA prefix.

   Whereas [RFC 3849] delegates 2001:db8::/32 to be used for
   documentation purposes where an IPv6 GUA prefix or address
   is needed, this memo proposes designating two /48s from
   ULA space for that purpose when an example of ULA is needed.

2. Acknowledgements

   This draft is a logical extension of the work in [RFC 3849] and
   I wish to thank and acknowledge the contributions of its authors
   Geoff Huston, Anne Lord, and Phil Smith.

3. Documentation IPv6 ULA Prefix

   To allow documentation to accurately describe deployment examples,
   the use of site local or link local addresses is inappropriate, and a
   unicast address block is required. While there is Global Unicast
   space designated for Documentation in [RFC 3849], no such provision
   exists within the ULA prefix (fc00::/7) for either random (fd00::/8)
   or registered (fc00::/8).

   Since 2001:db8::/32 was designated for documentation purposes in
   [RFC 3849] and is widely and readily recognized as such throughout
   the networking community, this memo suggests the use of similar
   ranges within the ULA prefixes for that same purpose. The proposed
   prefixes are fc00:2001:db8::/48 (ULA Registered) and
   fd00:2001:db8::/48 (ULA Random), respectively.

   In the case of fc00:2001:db8::/48 this would serve only as a
   statement of intent until such time as the use of fc00::/8 is
   documented by the IETF.

4.  Operational Implications

   This assignment implies that IPv6 network operators should not
   use these prefixes in their actual deployments of IPv6 ULA.

   Further it implies that these prefixes should be specifically
   filtered in any situation where overlapping ULA prefixes may be
   otherwise permitted by route or packet filters.

   This is not a local-use prefix, and the filters may be used in
   both local and public contexts, though in the public context, a
   more general filter of all ULA space (fc00::/7) may be more
   desirable. In general, the combination of the specific and more
   generic filter together should, while unnecessary, not have
   any harmful effects.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to record the allocation of the IPv6 ULA prefixes
   fc00:2001:db8::/48 and fd00:2001:db8::/48 as additional
   documentation-only prefixes in the IPv6 address registry.
   No end party is to be assigned these addresses.

6.  Security Considerations

   IPv6 addressing documents do not have any direct impact on Internet
   infrastructure security.
