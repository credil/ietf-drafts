           Policy for defining new service-identifying lables
               draft-ietf-ecrit-service-urn-policy-02.txt

Abstract

   In order to provide location-based services, descriptive terms for
   services need to be defined.  This document updates the policy for
   defining new service-identifying labels.

Internet-Draft             Service URN Policy                  June 2013


1.  Introduction

   Nowadays location-based services are widespread.  Devices can detect
   a user location and retrieve all available services in the
   sourroundings of that location.  A particular service can be
   described by one or multiple terms such as "restaurant", "parking"
   and "ATM machine".  All such terms, however, need to be formally
   defined so that a registry can be built and used to assure
   consistency and compatibility between devices and between service
   providers.  Since descriptive terms for services are almost
   unbounded, such registry would contain the most common terms.  In
   this document we update the policy for defining new terms, that is
   new service-identifying labels.


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Namespace Guidelines

   [NOTE: Have we agreed on this approach?  Do we allow private
   namespaces?]

   Whereas one entity applies for the registraton of several new top-
   level services which are of no interest to the general public, the
   expert reviewer SHOULD consider the creation of an ad-hoc private
   namespace (e.g., urn:nena [citation needed]) under which such entity
   would be free to define its own set of services and service labels.

   On the other hand, if the new top-level services are of interest to
   the general public or there is just one single top-level service to
   be registered, the expert reviewer SHOULD decide for registration in
   the public namespace domain (i.e., urn:service).

   Namespaces MAY at their discretion use discovery mechanisms other
   than the one described in [RFC5222].


4.  Guidelines for the creation of new top-level services

   The number of services that can be defined is very large.  New
   services, however, SHOULD at least satisfy the following guidelines.

   - The service MUST NOT overlap with any other service previously

   registered;

   - The service has to be of general interest;

   - It should not be specific to a particular country or region;

   - The language in which the new service is defined MUST be English
   (this is a protocol token, not meant to be shown to humans);

   - The newly defined services SHOULD correspond to a standard
   statistical classification of enterprises or services, such as the
   North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates Section 4.1 of [RFC5031] in that the policy for
   adding top-level service labels is "Expert Review".  The expert is
   designated by the RAI Area Director.  [NOTE: Add requirement for
   external non-IETF document or template here?]


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise security issues.
