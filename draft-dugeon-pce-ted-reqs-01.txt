   Path Computation Element (PCE) Traffic Engineering Database (TED)
                              Requirements
                      draft-dugeon-pce-ted-reqs-01

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced a
   set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation
   Element as a tool to help MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSP tunnels placement.
   In the PCE architecture, a main assumption has been done concerning
   the information that the PCE needs to perform its computation: the
   Traffic Engineering Database (TED) contains all pertinent and
   suitable information regarding the network that is in the scope of a
   PCE.  Nevertheless, the TED requirements as well as the TED
   information have not yet been formalized.  In addition, some recent
   RFC (like the Backward Recursive Path Computation procedure) or WG
   draft (like draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy ...) suffer from a lack of
   information in the TED, leading to a non optimal result or to some
   difficulties to deploy them.  This memo tries to identity some TED
   requirements for the PCE.  It is split in two main section: the
   identification of the specific information to be stored in the TED
   and how it may be populated.

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


1.  Problem Statement

   Looking to the different RFCs that describe the PCE architecture and
   in particular RFC 4655 [RFC4655], RFC 5440 [RFC5440] and RFC 5441
   [RFC5441] as well as the draft H-PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-hierarchy-fwk],
   the Path Computation Element (PCE) needs to acquire a set of
   information that is usually store in the Traffic Engineering Database
   (TED) in order to perform its path computation.  Even if intra-domain
   topology acquisition is well documented and known (e.g. by listening
   to the IGP-TE protocol that runs inside the network), inter-domain
   topology information, PCE peer address, neighbor AS ... that are
   necessary for the Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) and the
   Hierarchical PCE are not documented and not completely standardized.

   The purpose of this memo is to inventory the required information
   that should be part of the PCE TED and the different mechanisms that
   allow an operator to populate it.

1.1.  PCE Assumption and Hypothesis

   In some cases, both the path computation and the TED operations are
   slightly coupled: border node identification, endpoint localization
   and topology aggregation for domain sequence selection... to name a
   few in which an IGP-based TED may not be sufficient.  It is also
   important to differentiate several environments with different
   requirements, especially for the multi-domain problem.  The PCE is
   scoped for any kind of network, from transport networks (TDM/WDM)
   with a rather limited number of domains, few interconnections, and
   few confidentiality issues; transport networks with a large number of
   domains; MPLS networks with several administrative domains; and big
   IP/MPLS networks with a large number of domains with peering
   agreements.  For each of them, a different solution for the multi-
   domain path computation may apply.  A solution may not be scalable
   for one, but perfectly suitable for another.

   Up to now, PCE WG has based its work and standard on the assumption
   and hypothesis that the TED contains all pertinent information
   suitable for the PCE to compute an optimal TE-LSP placement, over one
   or several domains a PCE has visibility on or over a set of PCE-
   capable domains (e.g. using BRPC procedure).  We could identify two
   major sources of information for the TED:

   o  The intra-domain routing protocol like OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE
      (including extensions for border links),

   o  The inter-domain routing protocol, i.e.  BGP for the inter-AS
      case.

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


   If the first source gives a precise and synchronize view of the
   controlled network, BGP typically just provides network reachability
   with only one AS path (unless using recent add path option).
   Nevertheless, to optimize inter-domain path computation, route
   diversity and a minimum set of Traffic Engineering information about
   the foreign domains could be helpful.

   Another source of information, mainly static information can be the
   management plane, e.g. using SNMP, CLI...  So, it is necessary to
   classify the source of information by their frequency of update:
   static or dynamic, e.g. a domain ID is unlikely to change, while
   unreserved bandwidth of a link may be continuously changing.

1.2.  Terminology

   ABR: Area Border Routers.  Routers used to connect two IGP areas
   (areas in OSPF or levels in IS-IS).

   ASBR: Autonomous System Border Router.  Router used to connect
   together ASes of the same or different service providers via one or
   more inter-AS links.

   AS: Autonomous System

   Boundary Node (BN): a boundary node is either an ABR in the context
   of inter-area Traffic Engineering or an ASBR in the context of
   inter-AS Traffic Engineering.

   Domain: an Autonomous System

   Entry BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n-1) to domain(n) along
   a determined sequence of domains.

   Exit BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n) to domain(n+1) along
   a determined sequence of domains.

   Inter-area TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an IGP area boundary.

   Inter-AS TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an AS boundary.

   IGP-TE: Interior Gateway Protocol with Traffic Engineering support.
   Both OSPF-TE and IS-IS-TE are indentified in this category.

   PCE: Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application, or
   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

   PCE(i) is a PCE with the scope of domain(i).

   TED: Traffic Engineering Database.


2.  TED Requirements

   This section made a first inventory of the main requirements of the
   PCE TED in term of information that the database should contains.

2.1.  Intra-Domain

   This section describes the Intra-domain information that are suitable
   for the PCE TED including both MPLS and GMPLS.

2.1.1.  MPLS

   A PCE is allowed to compute paths in one or several domains.  Such
   PCE MUST be aware of the precise details of the network topology (or
   topologies) in order to compute optimal TE-LSP placements.  The
   information needed in this case includes:

   o  List of Internal Nodes identified by a reachable address: All
      nodes of the networks that are not border node,

   o  List of Internal Links that rely nodes (both internal and border
      nodes),

   o  Traffic Engineering information of the different links i.e.  RFC
      3630 [RFC3630] and RFC 5305 [RFC5305](with e.g. recent metric
      extensions proposal OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric
      Extensions [I-D.ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions])

   o  Traffic Engineering information with GMPLS extensions of the
      different links i.e.  RFC 4203 [RFC4203] and RFC 5307 [RFC5307],

   o  Traffic Engineering information of the nodes.

   The information above mentioned is usually exchanged using the IGP-TE
   protocol (OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE).

2.1.2.  GMPLS

   To be provided later

2.2.  Inter-Domain

   A PCE can also be allowed to take part to inter-domain path
   computation (e.g in per-domain path computation, BRPC or H-PCE
   relationship).  Some inter-domain information is mandatory when

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


   operator intend to use the PCE to compute Inter-AS TE LSP path that
   cross AS boundary.  For that purpose, the TED SHOULD contains all
   information that allow the PCE to determine the optimal AS path for
   the TE-LSP computation, which includes:

   o  ASBR of the foreign domain,

   o  Links between border nodes, i.e. links between Border Node (n) to
      Border node (n+1), inlcuding Traffic Engineering information as
      describe in and in ,

   o  Traffic Engineering performance between Border Nodes (n) to give
      performance indication on foreign domain n,

   o  PCE (i) peer address associated with the AS number of the foreign
      domain (i),

   RFC 5316 [RFC5316] and RFC 5392 [RFC5392] help to provide required
   TED information in the case of inter-domain.  TED can also contain
   information about virtual links and abstract information.

2.3.  Operational Information

   This part of the TED contains all others information pertinent for
   the PCE to compute TE LSP path but that are provided through the
   management system.


3.  TED Population

   This section aims to provide best current practices when mechanisms
   are well-known and some hints when standard solutions exist to
   populate the PCE TED, and so give directions to extend them.  In
   particular, we aim at providing input on whether the TED gets the
   information from the routing protocol and how it gets it, which
   specific routing protocols are suited, whether it gets it from an
   NMS, at what frequency the TED is updated... and if it needs extra
   information.

3.1.  Intra-domain

3.1.1.  MPLS

   As the TED mainly contains the intra-domain topology graph, it is
   RECOMMENDED to link the PCE with the underlying IGP-TE (OSPF-TE or
   IS-IS-TE routing protocol).  By adding the PCE into the IGP-TE
   routing intra-domain, it is possible to listen to the routing
   protocol and then acquired the complete topology graph as well as let

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


   the PCE announce itself (see RFC5088 and RFC5089).  In addition, the
   TED will synchronize as fast as the routing protocol converges like
   any router in the domain.  Best current practices are also of
   interest when a PCE compute path that spawn to several area / region.
   In that case, the PCE must be aware of the topology details of each
   area / region and not only the backbone area / region 1 with the
   summary of stub area / region 2.

   In addition, management tools may be used to complement the topology
   graph provided by the routing protocol.

3.1.2.  GMPLS

   To be provided later.

3.2.  Inter-Domain

   First of all, RFC 5316 or RFC 5392 MUST be activated in the IGP-TE
   (respectively in IS-IS-TE or OSPF-TE) in order to advertise TE
   information on the inter-domain links.  This give the advantage for
   the PCE to determine what could be feasible, during path computation,
   on the peering links.

   In MPLS, AS path and network reachability are obtained from BGP and
   routing tables.  However, it is not straightforward to collect route
   diversity or TE information (i.e. bandwidth, transit delay, packet
   loss ratio, jitter ...) on a foreign domain.  Right now, we have
   identified several methods, which have been tested to fill in the TED
   with this kind of information:

   o  Use of the management plane;

   o  Use of the "north bound distribution of Link-State and TE
      Information using BGP" [I-D.gredler-idr-ls-distribution] proposal
      to exchange TE information about the foreign domain;

   o  Use of PCNtf message to convey, inside vendor attribute (but in a
      non standardized way), TE information of foreign domain between
      PCE

   As well as some potential alternative mechanisms that would need more
   standardization effort:

   o  A hierarchical TE that could help to advertise, at the AS level,
      TE information on an abstract/aggregate view of the foreign AS
      topology;





Dugeon, et al.         Expires September 10, 2012               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


   o  A PCEP extension to convey such TE information to the foreign PCE.

3.3.  Operational information

   Most of the time operationals information are provided through the
   management system of the operator, but some could be automatically
   discovered.  In particular, in intra-domain, PCCs and PCEs can
   discover automatically reachable PCEs (as well as computation
   domains) through the deployment of RFC 5088 [RFC5088], for OSPF-
   controlled networks, and RFC 5089 [RFC5089] for IS-IS-controlled
   networks.  However, for the inter-PCE discovery at the inter-AS
   level, no mechanism has been standardized (unless ASes are owned by
   the same ISP).


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA for the moment.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


5.  Security Considerations

   Acquisition of information for the PCE TED is of course sensible from
   a security point of view, especially when acquiring information from
   others AS.  This section aims at providing best practices to prevent
   some security threat when the PCE try to acquire TED information.

5.1.  Intra-domain information

   Same security considerations must be applied to the PCE when it is
   connected to an IGP-TE protocol as the routing protocol itself.  Best
   practices observed and deployed by operators must also be taken into
   account when installing some PCEs.  Indeed, even when deployed as a
   standalone server, PCEs must be considered as a typical router from
   the IGP-TE perspective.  As a result, beyond OSPF or IS-IS
   tehmselves, the usual security rules must be applied, e.g. login/
   passwd, authentication/digest... to protect the connectivity.

5.2.  Inter-domain information

   Inter-domain relation and so information exchange are subject to high
   potential hijack and so need attention from the security point of
   view.  To avoid disclosing or expose confidential information that
   two operators would exchange to fill in the TEDs of their respective
   PCEs, the relation SHOULD be protected by standard cryptography

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


   mechanism.  E.g. using IPsec tunnel is RECOMMENDED to protect the
   connectivity between PCEs and the TED exchanges.

5.3.  Operational information

   All operational information like PCE peer addresses are generally
   added manually to the TED and so do not need any particular
   protection nor subject to security.  But, as this basic information
   is needed to connected the PCEs to their peers, it could potentially
   be associated to sensitive parameters like login and password.  So,
   standard Best Practices are RECOMMENDED to avoid basic security
   exposition.
