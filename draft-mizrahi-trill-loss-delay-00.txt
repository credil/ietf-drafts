1. Introduction

   TRILL [RFCTRILL] is a protocol for transparent least cost routing,
   where RBridges forward traffic to their destination based on a least
   cost route, using a TRILL encapsulation header with a hop count.

   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) [OAM] is a set of
   tools for detecting, isolating and reporting connection failures and
   performance degradation. Performance Monitoring (PM) is a key aspect
   of OAM. PM allows network operators to detect and debug network
   anomalies and incorrect behavior. PM consists of two main building
   blocks - Loss Measurement (LM) and Delay Measurement (DM). PM may
   also include other derived metrics such as Packet Delivery Rate
   (PDR), and delay variation.

   The requirements of OAM in TRILL networks are defined in [OAM-REQ],
   and the TRILL OAM framework is described in [OAM-FRAMEWK]. These two
   documents also highlight the main requirements in terms of
   performance monitoring.

   This document defines protocols for loss measurement and for delay
   measurement in TRILL networks. These protocols are somewhat based on
   the ones defined in [Y.1731].

   o Loss Measurement (LM): the LM protocol measures the packet loss
      between two RBridges. The measurement is performed by sending a
      set of synthetic packets, and counting the number of packets
      transmitted and received during the test. The loss rate is
      calculated by comparing the counters of transmitted and received
      packets.
      This document does not define an LM protocol that computes the
      packet loss of data-plane traffic. For further details see [OAM-
      FRAMEWK].

   o Delay Measurement (DM): the DM protocol measures the packet delay
      and packet delay variation between two RBridges. The measurement
      is performed using timestamped OAM messages.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2. Definitions

   o One-way packet delay - (as defined in [OAM-REQ]) the time elapsed
      from the start of transmission of the first bit of a packet by an
      RBridge until the reception of the last bit of the packet by the
      remote RBridge.

   o Two-way packet delay - (as defined in [OAM-REQ]) the time elapsed
      from the start of transmission of the first bit of a packet from
      the local RBridge, receipt of the packet at the remote RBridge,
      the remote RBridge sending a response packet back to the local
      RBridge and the local RBridge receiving the last bit of that
      response packet.

   o Packet loss - the number of packets lost in a specific LM test,
      and a specific observation period.

   o Far-end packet loss - the number of packets lost on the path from
      the local RBridge to the remote RBridge in a specific LM test, and
      a specific observation period.

      the remote RBridge to the local RBridge in a specific LM test, and
      a specific observation period.

   Performance Monitoring (PM) allows a MEP to perform loss and delay
   measurements to any MEP in the campus. Performance monitoring is
   performed in the context of a specific Maintenance Domain (MD).

   A MEP MUST support generation of PM messages, response to PM messages
   and computation of the packet loss and packet delay.

   The PM functionality defined in this document is not applicable to
   MIPs.

3.1. Peformance Monitoring Granularity

   As defined in [OAM-FRAMEWK], PM can be applied at three levels of
   granularity, 'Network', 'Service' and 'Flow':

   o Network-level PM: the PM protocol is run over a dedicated test
      VLAN or FGL.

   o Service-level PM: the PM protocol is used to perform measurements
      of actual user VLANs or FGL.

   o Flow-level PM: the PM protocol is used to perform measurements on
      a per-flow basis. A flow, as defined in [OAM-REQ], is a set of
      packets that share the same path and per-hop behavior (such as
      priority).
      As defined in [OAM-FRAMEWK], flow-based monitoring uses a Flow
      Entropy field that resides at the beginning of the OAM packet
      header (see Section 6.1.), and mimics the forwarding behavior of
      the monitored flow.

3.2. One-Way vs. Two-Way Performance Monitoring

   Paths in a TRILL network are not necessarily symmetric, i.e., a
   packet sent from RB1 to RB2 does not necessarily traverse the same
   set of RBridges as a packet sent from RB2 to RB1. Even within a given
   flow, packets from RB1 to RB2 do not necessarily traverse the same
   path as packets from RB2 to RB1. Therefore, this document provides

   tools for one-way performance monitoring and for two-way performance
   monitoring.

3.2.1. One-Way Performance Monitoring

   In one-way PM, RB1 sends PM messages to RB2, allowing RB2 to monitor
   the performance on the path from RB1 to RB2.

   A MEP SHOULD support one-way performance monitoring. A MEP SHOULD
   support both the functionality of the sender, RB1, and the
   functionality of the receiver, RB2.

   One-way PM can be applied either proactively or on-demand, although
   the more typical scenario is the proactive mode, where RB1 and RB2
   periodically transmit PM messages to each other, allowing each of
   them to monitor the performance on the incoming path from the peer
   MEP.

3.2.2. Two-Way Performance Monitoring

   In two-way PM, a sender, RB1, sends PM messages to a refelector, RB2,
   and RB2 responds to these messages, allowing RB1 to monitor the
   performance of:

   o The path from RB1 to RB2.

   o The path from RB2 to RB1.

   o The two-way path from RB1 to RB2, and back to RB1.

   Note that in some cases it may be interesting for RB1 to monitor only
   the path from RB1 to RB2. Two-way PM allows the sender, RB1, to
   monitor the path from RB1 to RB2, as opposed to one-way PM (Section
   3.2.1.), which allows the receiver, RB2, to monitor this path.

   A MEP MUST support two-way PM. A MEP MUST support both the sender and
   the reflector functionality.

   As described in Section 3.1., flow-based PM uses the Flow Entropy
   field as one of the parameters that identify a flow. In two-way PM,
   the Flow Entropy of the path from RB1 to RB2 is typically different
   than the Flow Entropy of the path from RB2 to RB1. This document
   defines a Reflector Entropy TLV (Section 6.4.), which allows the
   sender to specify the Flow Entropy value to be used in the response
   message.

   Two-way PM can be applied either proactively or on-demand.

Internet-Draft      TRILL Performance Monitoring         February 2013


3.3. Point-to-point PM vs. Point-to-multipoint PM

   PM can be applied either as a point-to-point measurement protocol, or
   as a point-to-multi-point measurement protocol.

   The point-to-point approach measures the performance between two
   RBridges using unicast PM messages.

   In the point-to-multipoint approach an RBridge RB1 sends PM messages
   to multiple RBridges using multicast messages. The reflectors (in
   two-way PM) respond to RB1 using unicast messages.

4. Loss Measurement

   The LM protocol has two flavors, One-Way Loss Measurement (OWLM), and
   Two-Way Loss Measurement (TWLM).

   Notes: [Y.1731] defines two-way LM, but does not support one-way LM.
   The terms 'one-way' and 'two-way' LM should not be confused with the
   terms 'single-ended' and 'dual-ended' LM used in [Y.1731]. As defined
   in Section 3.2., the terms 'one-way' and 'two-way' specify whether
   the protocol monitors performance on one direction, or on both
   directions. The terms 'single-ended' and 'dual-ended', on the other
   hand, describe whether the protocol is asymmetric or symmetric,
   respectively.

4.1. One-Way Loss Measurement (OWLM)

   OWLM measures the one-way packet loss rate from one MEP to another.
   The loss rate is measured using a set of One-way Synthetic Loss
   Measurement (1SLM) messages. The packet format of the 1SLM message is
   specified in Section 6.2.2. Figure 2 illustrates an OWLM message
   exchange.

   The OWLM procedure uses a set of 1SLM messages to measure the packet
   loss rate. The figure shows two non-consecutive messages from the
   set.

   The sender maintains a counter of transmitted 1SLM messages, and
   includes the value of this counter, TX, in each 1SLM message it
   transmits. The receiver maintains a counter of received 1SLM
   messages, RX, and can calculate the loss rate by comparing its
   counter values to the counter values received in the 1SLM messages.

   In Figure 2, the subscript 'c' is short for current, and 'p' is short
   for previous.

4.1.1. 1SLM Message Transmission

   OWLM can be applied either proactively or on-demand, although as
   mentioned in Section 3.2.1., it is more likely to be applied
   proactively.

   The term 'on-demand' in the context of OWLM implies that the sender
   transmits a fixed set of 1SLM messages, allowing the receiver to
   perform the measurement based on this set.

   A MEP that supports OWLM MUST support unicast transmission of 1SLM
   messages.

   A MEP that supports OWLM MAY support multicast transmission of 1SLM
   messages.

   The sender MUST maintain a packet counter for each peer MEP and test
   ID. Every time the sender transmits a 1SLM packet it increments the
   corresponding counter, and then integrates the value of the counter
   into the <Counter TX> field of the 1SLM packet.

   The 1SLM message MAY be sent with a Data TLV, allowing loss
   measurement for various packet sizes.

4.1.2. 1SLM Message Reception

   The receiver MUST maintain a reception counter for each peer MEP and
   test ID. Upon receiving a 1SLM packet, the receiver MUST verify that:

   o The 1SLM packet is destined to the current MEP.

   o The packet's MD level matches the MEP's MD level.

Internet-Draft      TRILL Performance Monitoring         February 2013


   If both conditions are satisfied, the receiver increments the
   corresponding packet counter, and records the new value of the
   counter, RX1.

   A MEP that supports OWLM MUST support reception of both unicast and
   multicast 1SLM messages.

   The receiver computes the one-way packet loss with respect to a
   measurement interval. A measurement interval includes a sequence of
   1SLM message. The one-way packet loss is computed by comparing the
   counter values TXp and RXp at the beginning of the measurement
   interval, and the counter values TXc and RXc at the end of the
   measurement interval (Figure 2):

           one-way packet loss = (TXc-TXp) - (RXc-RXp)     (1)

   The calculation in Equation (1) is based on counter value
   differences, implying that the sender's counter, TX, and the
   receiver's counter, RX, are not required to be synchronized with
   respect to a common init value.

   When the receiver calculates the packet loss per Equation (1) it MUST
   perform a wraparound check. If the receiver detects that one of the
   counters has wrapped around, the receiver adjusts the result of
   Equation (1) accordingly.

   A 1SLM receiver MUST support reception of 1SLM messages with a Data
   TLV.

4.2. Two-Way Loss Measurement (TWLM)

   TWLM allows a MEP to measure the packet loss on the paths to and from
   a peer MEP. TWLM uses a set of Synthetic loss Measurement Messages
   (SLM) to compute the packet loss. Each SLM is answered with a
   Synthetic loss Measurement Reply (SLR). The packet formats of the SLM
   and SLR packets are specified in Sections 6.2.3. and 6.2.4.,
   respectively. Figure 2 illustrates a TWLM message exchange.

   The TWLM procedure uses a set of SLM-SLR handshakes. The figure shows
   two non-consecutive handshakes from the set.

   The sender maintains a counter of transmitted SLM messages, and
   includes the value of this counter, TX, in each transmitted SLM
   message. The reflector maintains a counter of received SLM messages,
   TRX. The reflector generates an SLR, and incorporates TRX into the
   SLR packet. The sender maintains a counter of received SLR messages,
   RX. Upon receiving an SLR message, the sender can calculate the loss
   rate by comparing the local counter values to the counter values
   received in the SLR messages.

   The subscript 'c' is short for current, and 'p' is short for
   previous.

4.2.1. SLM Message Transmission

   TWLM can be applied either proactively or on-demand.

   A MEP that supports TWLM MUST support unicast transmission of SLM
   messages.

   A MEP that supports TWLM MAY support multicast transmission of SLM
   messages.

   The sender MUST maintain a counter of transmitted SLM packets for
   each peer MEP and test ID. Every time the sender transmits an SLM
   packet it increments the corresponding counter, and then integrates
   the value of the counter into the <Counter TX> field of the SLM
   packet.

   A sender MAY include a Reflector Entropy TLV in an SLM message. The
   Reflecotr Entropy TLV format is specified in Section 6.4.

   An SLM message MAY be sent with a Data TLV, allowing loss measurement
   for various packet sizes.

4.2.2. SLM Message Reception

   The reflector MUST maintain a reception counter, TRX, for each peer
   MEP and test ID.

   Upon receiving an SLM packet, the reflector MUST verify that:

   o The SLM packet is destined to the current MEP.

   o The packet's MD level matches the MEP's MD level.

   If both conditions are satisfied, the reflector increments the
   corresponding packet counter, and records the value of the new
   counter, TRX. The reflector then generates an SLR message that is
   identical to the received SLM, except for the following
   modifications:

   o The reflector incorporates TRX into the <Counter TRX> field of the
      SLR.

   o The <OpCode> field in the OAM header is set to the SLR OpCode.

   o The reflector assigns its MEP ID in the <Reflector MEP ID> field.

   o If the received SLM includes a Reflector Entropy TLV (see Section
      6.4.), the reflector copies the value of the Flow Entropy from
      the TLV into the <Flow Entropy> field of the SLR message. The
      outgoing SLR message does not include a Reflector Entropy TLV.

   o The TRILL header and transport header are modified to reflect the
      source and destination of the SLR packet. The SLR is always a
      unicast message.

   A MEP that supports TWLM MUST support reception of both unicast and
   multicast SLM messages.

   A reflector MUST support reception of SLM packets with a Data TLV.
   When receiving an SLM with a Data TLV, the reflector includes the
   unmodified TLV in the SLR.

4.2.3. SLR Message Reception

   The sender MUST maintain a reception counter, RX, for each peer MEP
   and test ID.

   Upon receiving an SLR message, the sender MUST verify that:

   o The SLR packet is destined to the current MEP.

   o The <Sender MEP ID> field in the SLR packet matches the current
      MEP.

   o The packet's MD level matches the MEP's MD level.

   If the conditions above are met, the sender increments the
   corresponding reception counter, and records the new value, RX.

   The receiver computes the one-way packet delay with respect to a
   measurement interval. A measurement interval includes a sequence of
   1SLM message. The one-way packet delay is performed by comparing the
   counter values TXp and RXp at the beginning of the measurement
   interval, and the counter values TXc and RXc at the end of the
   measurement interval (Figure 2):

   The sender computes the packet loss with respect to a measurement
   interval. A measurement interval includes a sequence of SLM messages,
   and their corresponding SLR messages. The packet loss rate is
   computed by comparing the counters at the beginning of the
   measurement interval, denoted with a subscript 'p', and the counters
   at the end of the measurement interval, denoted with a subscript 'c'
   (Figure 3):

         far-end packet loss = (TXc-TXp) - (TRXc-TRXp)     (2)

         near-end packet loss = (TRXc-TRXp) - (RXc-RXp)     (3)

   The calculations in the two equations above are based on counter
   value differences, implying that the sender's counters, TX and RX,
   and the reflector's counter, TRX, are not required to be synchronized
   with respect to a common init value.

   When the sender calculates the packet loss per Equations (2) and (3)
   it MUST perform a wraparound check. If the reflector detects that one
   of the counters has wrapped around, the reflector adjusts the result
   of Equations (2) and (3) accordingly.

   A sender MAY choose to monitor only the far-end packet loss, i.e.,
   perform the computation in Equation (2), and ignore the computation
   in Equation (3). Note that in this case the sender can run flow-based
   PM of the path TO the peer MEP without using the Reflector Entropy
   TLV.

5. Delay Measurement

   The DM protocol has two flavors, One-Way Delay Measurement (OWDM),
   and Two-Way Delay Measurement (TWDM).

5.1. One-Way Delay Measurement (OWDM)

   OWDM is used for computing the one-way packet delay from one MEP to
   another. The packet format used in OWDM is referred to as 1DM, and is
   specified in Section 6.3.2. The OWDM message exchange is illustrated
   in Figure 4.

                                     T1
                      Sender    -------------------         ----> time
                                      \
                                       \ 1DM
                                        \
                                        \/
                      Receiver  -------------------
                                        T2

                    Figure 4 One-Way Delay Measurement



   The sender transmits a 1DM message incorporating its time of
   transmission, T1. The receiver then receives the message at time T2,
   and calculates the one-way delay as:

                         one-way delay = T2-T1       (4)

   Equation (4) implies that T2 and T1 are measured with respect to a
   common reference time. Hence, two MEPs running a OWDM protocol MUST
   be time-synchronized. The method used for synchronizing the two MEPs
   is outside the scope of this document.

5.1.1. 1DM Message Transmission

   1DM packets can be transmitted proactively or on-demand, although as
   mentioned in Section 3.2.1., they are typically transmitted
   proactively.

   A MEP that supports OWDM MUST support unicast transmission of 1DM
   messages.

   A MEP that supports OWDM MAY support multicast transmission of 1DM
   messages.

   A 1DM message MAY be sent with a Data TLV, allowing packet delay
   measurement for various packet sizes.

   The sender incorporates the 1DM packet's time of transmission into
   the <Timestamp T1> field.

5.1.2. 1DM Message Reception

   Upon receiving a 1DM packet, the receiver records its time of
   reception, T2. The receiver MUST verify two conditions:

   o The 1DM packet is destined to the current MEP.

   o The packet's MD level matches the MEP's MD level.

   If both conditions are satisfied, the receiver terminates the packet
   and calculates the one-way delay as specified in Equation (4).

   A MEP that supports OWDM MUST support reception of both unicast and
   multicast 1DM messages.

   A 1DM receiver MUST support reception of 1DM messages with a Data
   TLV.

   When OWDM packets are received periodically, the receiver MAY compute
   the packet delay variation based on multiple measurements. Note that
   packet delay variation can be computed even when the two peer MEPs
   are not time synchronized.

5.2. Two-Way Delay Measurement (TWDM)

   TWDM uses a two-way handshake for computing the two-way packet delay
   between two MEPs. The handshake includes two packets, a Delay
   Measurement Message (DMM) and a Delay Measurement Reply (DMR). The

   DMM and DMR packet formats are specified in Section 6.3.3. and 6.3.4.
   , respectively.

   The TWDM message exchange is illustrated in Figure 5.

                    Figure 5 Two-Way Delay Measurement



   The sender generates a DMM message incorporating its time of
   transmission, T1. The reflector receives the DMM message and records
   its time of reception, T2. The reflector then generates a DMR
   message, incorporating T1, T2 and the DMR's transmission time, T3.
   The sender receives the DMR message at T4, and using the 4 timestamps
   it calculates the two-way packet delay.

5.2.1. DMM Message Transmission

   DMM packets can be transmitted periodically or on-demand.

   A MEP that supports TWDM MUST support unicast transmission of DMM
   messages.

   A MEP that supports TWDM MAY support multicast transmission of DMM
   messages.

   A sender MAY include a Reflector Entropy TLV in a DMM message. The
   Reflecotr Entropy TLV format is specified in Section 6.4.

   A DMM MAY be sent with a Data TLV, allowing packet delay measurement
   for various packet sizes.

   The sender incorporates the DMM packet's time of transmission into
   the <Timestamp T1> field.

Internet-Draft      TRILL Performance Monitoring         February 2013


5.2.2. DMM Message Reception

   Upon receiving a DMM packet, the reflector records its time of
   reception, T2. The reflector MUST verify two conditions:

   o The DMM packet is destined to the current MEP.

   o The packet's MD level matches the MEP's MD level.

   If both conditions are satisfied, the reflector terminates the
   packet, and generates a DMR packet. The DMR is identical to the
   received DMM, except for the following modifications:

   o The reflector incorporates T2 into the <Timestamp T2> field of the
      DMR.

   o The reflector incorporates the DMR's transmission time, T3, into
      the <Timestamp T3> field of the DMR.

   o The <OpCode> field in the OAM header is set to the DMR OpCode.

   o If the received DMM includes a Reflector Entropy TLV (see Section
      6.4.), the reflector copies the value of the Flow Entropy from
      the TLV into the <Flow Entropy> field of the DMR message. The
      outgoing DMR message does not include a Reflector Entropy TLV.

   o The TRILL header and transport header are modified to reflect the
      source and destination of the DMR packet. The DMR is always a
      unicast message.

   A MEP that supports TWDM MUST support reception of both unicast and
   multicast DMM messages.

   A reflector MUST support reception of DMM packets with a Data TLV.
   When receiving a DMM with a Data TLV, the reflector includes the
   unmodified TLV in the DMR.

5.2.3. DMR Message Reception

   Upon receiving the DMR message, the sender records its time of
   reception, T4. The sender MUST verify:

   o The DMR packet is destined to the current MEP.

   o The packet's MD level matches the MEP's MD level.

Internet-Draft      TRILL Performance Monitoring         February 2013


   If both conditions above are met, the sender uses the 4 timestamps to
   compute the two-way delay:

                   two-way delay = (T4-T1) - (T3-T2)       (5)

   While OWDM requires the two MEPs to be synchronized, TWDM allows the
   sender to calculate the two-way delay without being synchronized to
   the reflector.

   Two MEPs running a TWDM protocol MAY be time-synchronized. If TWDM is
   run between two time-synchronized MEPs, the sender MAY compute the
   one-way delays:

              one-way delay {sender->reflector} = T2 - T1       (6)

              one-way delay {reflector->sender} = T4 - T3       (7)

   When TWDM is run periodically, the sender MAY also compute the delay
   variation based on multiple measurements.

   A sender MAY choose to monitor only the sender->reflector delay,
   i.e., perform the computation in Equation (6), and ignore the
   computations in (5) and (7). Note that in this case the sender can
   run flow-based PM of the path TO the peer MEP without using the
   Reflector Entropy TLV.

6.3. Delay Measurement Packet Formats

6.3.1. Timestamp Format

   The timestamps used in DM packets are 64 bits long. These timestamps
   use the 64 least significant bits of the IEEE 1588-2008 (1588v2)
   Precision Time Protocol timestamp format [IEEE1588].

   This truncated format consists of a 32-bit seconds field followed by
   a 32-bit nanoseconds field. This truncated format is also used in
   IEEE 1588v1, in [Y.1731], and in [MPLS-LM-DM].
