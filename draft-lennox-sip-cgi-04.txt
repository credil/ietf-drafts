In Internet telephony, there must be a means by which new services are
created and deployed rapidly.  In the World Wide Web, the Common
Gateway Interface (CGI) has served as popular means towards
programming web services.  Due to the similarities between the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
CGI is a good candidate for service creation in a SIP environment.
This document defines a SIP CGI interface for providing SIP services
on a SIP server.
