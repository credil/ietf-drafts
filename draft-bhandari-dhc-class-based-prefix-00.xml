      <t>DHCPv6 defines class based allocation of IA_NA and IA_TA IPv6
      addresses. This document extends DHCPv6 prefix delegation with class
      based prefix allocation. It defines a new prefix class option to
      classify a prefix. It defines the behavior of a DHCPv6 client requesting
      a prefix to include the class of the prefix to be allocated and the
      DHCPv6 server behavior to select and offer a prefix from a given class.
      It discusses how IA_NA can be requested and assigned from a specific
      prefix class.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>DHCPv6 based prefix delegation as defined in <xref
      target="RFC3633"></xref> is a mechanism for the delegation of IPv6
      prefixes using DHCPv6 options. Through these options, a delegating
      router can delegate prefixes to authorized requesting routers. If the
      requesting router has to function as a DHCPv6 server there needs to be
      additional information in the delegated prefix that helps the requesting
      router to select the address allocation for the DHCPv6 client it serves,
      from one of the available delegated prefixes.</t>

      <t>One way to select an address or longer prefix (from a delegated
      prefix) to be allocated by a requesting router playing the role of a
      DHCPv6 server is by introducing additional options in IA_PD to be
      matched with options for address selection in the DHCPv6 SOLICIT
      message. <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> defines the OPTION_USER_CLASS
      option which is used for selecting address for assignment. This document
      introduces OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option in IA_PD option for the purpose of
      selecting a prefix for further delegation either via IA_NA or IA_PD
      DHCPv6 request. It defines the behavior of the DHCPv6 server, the DHCPv6
      prefix requesting router and the DHCPv6 client to use this option.</t>

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>In this section motivation for class based prefix delegation that
        qualifies the delegated prefix with additional class information is
        described in the context of mobile networks and homenet. The class
        information attached to a delegated prefix helps to distinguish
        property of a delegated IPv6 prefix and selection of the prefix by
        different applications using it.</t>

        <section title="Mobile network">
          <t>In the mobile network architecture, there is a mobile router
          which functions as a IP network gateway and provides IP connectivity
          to mobile nodes. Mobile router can be the requesting router
          requesting delegated IPv6 prefix using DHCPv6. Mobile router can
          assume the role of DHCPv6 server for mobile nodes(DHCPv6 clients)
          attached to it. A mobile node in mobile network architecture can be
          associated with multiple IPv6 prefixes beloging to different domains
          for e.g. home address prefix, care of address prefix as specified in
          <xref target="RFC3775"></xref>. The delegated prefixes when seen
          from the mobile router perspective appear to be like any other
          prefix, but each prefixes have different properties. Some delegated
          prefixes may be topologically local and some may be remote prefixes
          anchored on a global anchor, but available to the local anchor by
          means of tunneling setup in the network between the local and global
          anchor. Some may be local with low latency characteristics suitable
          for voice call break-out, some may have global mobility support. So,
          the prefixes have different properties and it is required for the
          application using the prefix to learn about this property in order
          to use it intelligently. There is currently no semantics in DHCPv6
          prefix delegation that can carry this information to specify
          properties of a delegated prefix. In this scenario, the mobile
          router is unable to further delegate a longer prefix intelligently
          based on properties of the prefix learnt.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Homenet">
          <t>With the introduction of IPv6 and possible absence of Network
          Address Translation(NAT) in home networks, the IPv6 source address
          of the hosts can be used as a parameter for route decision and
          providing differentiated service for different classes of devices
          within a home network. <xref
          target="I-D.baker-fun-routing-class"></xref> and <xref
          target="I-D.baker-fun-multi-router"></xref> introduce use-cases and
          requirements for source based routing. The home network architecture
          and associated requirements are specified in <xref
          target="I-D.chown-homenet-arch"></xref>. To support source based
          routing it is necessary to have a mechanism to assign the source
          address or prefix based on parameters that identify the class of
          device or network.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC3315"></xref> defines OPTION_USER_CLASS option
          in the IA_NA/IA_TA assignment, which influences the address
          allocated based on the user class of the device requesting IA_NA or
          IA_TA. A typical deployment in a home network is the Customer
          Premise Equipment (CPE) to be a DHCPv6 client requesting a prefix as
          defined in [RFC3633] from upstream the DHCPv6 server and playing the
          role of a DHCPv6 server for devices in the Local Area Network (LAN).
          The CPE can get a shorter prefix from a DHCPv6 server in Wide Area
          Network(WAN) and allocate longer prefixes to its DHCPv6 clients.
          Today the CPE has to be manually configured to associate a prefix
          acquired from the WAN to devices in the LAN. A means of classifying
          and associating an acquired prefix via DHCPv6 for further delegation
          either via IA_NA/IA_TA or IA_PD requests is missing.</t>

          <t>For e.g. as shown in <xref target="fig-homenetwork"></xref> the
          CPE in a home network may request prefixes from the DHCPv6 server of
          the service provider and assume the role of a DHCPv6 server for
          devices within the home network. Residential and
          Small-Office/Home-Office (SOHO) networks may have separate domains
          for their &ldquo;data network&rdquo; and &ldquo;home video
          network&rdquo;. Devices in these different domains are to be
          assigned addresses from different prefix ranges. The CPE router will
          need a way to assign prefixes to the home video network from a
          prefix that is meant for home video devices to provide
          differentiated service for such devices in the provider network that
          has source address based routing policy configured. </t>

               title="Consideration for different DHCPv6 entities">
        <t>The model of operation of communicating prefixes to be used by a
        DHCPv6 server is as follows. A requesting router requests prefix(es)
        from the delegating router, as described in Section 2.2.1. A
        delegating router is provided IPv6 prefixes to be delegated to the
        requesting router. Examples of ways in which the delegating router is
        provided these prefixes are: </t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Configuration</t>

            <t>Prefix delegated via a DHCPv6 request to another DHCPv6
            server</t>

            <t>Using a Authentication Authorization Accounting (AAA) protocol
            like RADIUS <xref target="RFC2865"></xref></t>
          </list>The delegating router chooses prefix(es) for delegation, and
        responds with prefix(es) to the requesting router along with
        additional options in the allocated prefix as described in Section
        2.2.2. The requesting router is then responsible for the delegated
        prefix(es) after the DHCPv6 REQUEST message exchange. For example, the
        requesting router may create DHCPv6 server configuration pools from
        the delegated prefix, and function as a DHCPv6 Server. When the
        requesting router then receives a DHCPv6 IA_NA requests it can select
        the address to be allocated based on the OPTION_USER_CLASS or
        OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS options received in IA_NA request or any of the
        other methods as described in Section 2.3.1.</t>

        <section title="Requesting Router Behavior ">
          <t>DHCPv6 requesting router can request for prefixes in the
          following ways:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>In the SOLICIT message within the IA_PD Prefix option, it MAY
              include OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS requesting prefix delegation for the
              specific class indicated in the OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option. It
              can include multiple IA_PD Prefix options to indicate it's
              preference for more than one prefix class.</t>

              <t>In the SOLICIT message include an OPTION_ORO option with the
              OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option code to request prefixes from all the
              classes that the DHCPv6 server can provide to this requesting
              Router. </t>
            </list>The requesting router parses the OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option
          in theOPTION_IAPREFIX option area of the corresponding IA_PD Prefix
          option in the ADVERTISE message. The Requesting router MUST then
          include all or subset of the received class based prefix(es) in the
          REQUEST message so that it will be responsible for the prefixes

        <section title="Delegating Router Behavior">
          <t>If the Delegating router supports class based prefix allocation
          by supporting the OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option and it is configured to
          assign prefixes from different classes, it selects prefixes for
          class based prefix allocation in the following way:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>If requesting router includes OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS within the
              IA_PD Prefix option, it selects prefixes to be offered from that
              specific class.</t>

              <t>If requesting router includes OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS within
              OPTION_ORO, then based on its configuration and policy it MAY
              offer prefixes from multiple classes available.</t>
            </list>The delegating router responds with an ADVERTISE message
          after populating the IP_PD option with prefixes from different
          prefix classes. Along with including the IA_PD prefix options in the
          IA_PD option, it also includes the OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option in the
          OPTION_IAPREFIX option area of the corresponding IA_PD prefix
          option. </t>

          <t>If neither the OPTION_ORO nor the IA_PD option in the SOLICIT
          message include the OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option, then the delegating
          router MAY allocate the prefix as specified in <xref
          target="RFC3633"></xref> without including the class option in the
          IA_PD prefix option in the response.</t>

          <t>If OPTION_ORO option in the Solicit message includes the
          OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS option code but the delegating router does not
          support the solution described in this specification, then the
          delegating router acts as specified in [RFC3633]. The requesting
          router MUST in this case also fall back to the behavior specified in
          <xref target="RFC3633"></xref>.</t>

          <t>If both delegating and requesting routers support class-based
          prefix allocation, but the delegating router cannot offer prefixes
          for any other reason, it MUST respond to requesting router with
          appropriate status code as specified in <xref
          target="RFC3633"></xref>. For e.g., if no prefixes are available in
          the specified class then the delegating router MUST include the
          status code NoPrefixAvail in the response message. </t>

          <t>The requesting router can use the delegated prefix(es) from
          different classes (for example "video", "guest", "voice" etc), for

      <section title="Class based prefix delegation">
        <t>The Service Provider Router is preconfigured to provide prefixes
        from the following classes: "video", "default", "guest", and
        "smart-grid". It has a preconfigured policy to advertise prefixes to
        requesting routers based on the services supported by the service
        provider for a given home. In the example home network, the CPE
        requests class based prefix allocation by sending a DHCPv6 SOLICIT
        message and include OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS in the OPTION_ORO. </t>

        <t>The CPE receives an advertise with following prefixes in the IA_PD
        option :</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>IA_PD Prefix option with a prefix 3001::1::/64 containing
            OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS set to "video"</t>

            <t>IA_PD Prefix option with a prefix 3001::2::/64 containing
            OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS set to "guest"</t>

            <t>IA_PD Prefix option with a prefix 3001::3::/64 containing
            OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS set to "smart-grid"</t>

            <t>IA_PD Prefix option with a prefix 3001::4::/64 containing
            OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS set to "default"</t>
          </list>It sends a REQUEST message with all of above prefixes and
        receives a REPLY message. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 address assignment from class based prefix">
        <t>The video endpoint in Network A in<xref
        target="fig_Example_homenetwork"></xref> sends a DHCPv6 SOLICIT
        message requesting IA_NA address assignment with OPTION_USER_CLASS
        option containing the value "video" towards the CPE. The CPE assumes
        the role of the DHCPv6 server and sends an ADVERTISE to the video
        endpoint with OPTION_IA_NA containing an IPv6 address in OPTION_IAADDR
        from the "video" prefix class. The IPv6 address in the OPTION_IAADDR
        is set to 3001::1::1. </t>

        <t>When the CPE receives a DHCPv6 SOLICIT requesting IA_NA for the
        IPv6 host from Network B, it offers an IPv6 address from the prefix
        class "default". For IPv6 host A it advertises 3001::4::1 as the IPv6
        address in OPTION_IAADDR in response to the IA_NA request. </t>

        <t>When the CPE receives a DHCPv6 SOLICIT requesting IA_NA for the
        IPv6 host from Network D (guest network), it offers an IPv6 address
        from the prefix class "guest". For IPv6 host B it advertises
        3001::2::1 as the IPv6 address in OPTION_IAADDR in response to the
        IA_NA request. The Network D can be distinguished based on a
        preconfigured interface or SSID advertised by this CPE for guest hosts
        connecting to it. </t>

      <section title="IPv6 prefix delegation from class based prefix">
        <t>The IPv6 Smart Grid router in <xref
        target="fig_Example_homenetwork"></xref> sends a SOLICIT towards the
        CPE requesting prefix delegation in the "smart-grid" class by
        including the IA_PD option with the OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS containing
        "smart-grid". The CPE selects a longer prefix from "smart-grid" prefix
        previously obtained from Service Provider Router. It sends a DHCPv6
        ADVERTISE message with IA_PD option containing the IPv6 prefix 3001::
        3:1::/96 and OPTION_PREFIX_CLASS set to "smart-grid". The Smart Grid
        router MAY then advertise that prefix in IPv6 Router Advertisement
        (RA) messages towards IPv6 sensors connected to it. IPv6 sensors can
        do SLAAC (<xref target="RFC4862">as defined in</xref>) to configure
