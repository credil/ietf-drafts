  RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) for Bytes Discarded
                                 Metric
          draft-ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-bytes-discarded-metric-00

Abstract

   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-
   time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term
   and long-term reception statistics.  The available reporting may
   include aggregate information across longer periods of time as well
   as individual packet reporting.  This document specifies a report
   computing the bytes discarded from the de-jitter buffer after
   successful reception.

1.  Introduction

   RTP [RFC3550] provides a transport for real-time media flows such as
   audio and video together with the RTP control protocol (RTCP) which
   provides periodic feedback about the media streams received in a
   specific duration.  In addition, RTCP can be used for timely feedback
   about individual events to report (e.g., packet loss) [RFC4585].
   Both long-term and short-term feedback enable a media sender to adapt
   its media transmission and/or encoding dynamically to the observed
   path characteristics.

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR Bytes Discarded             October 2013


   RFC3611 [RFC3611] defines RTCP Extended Reports as a detailed
   reporting framework to provide more than just the coarse Receiver
   Report (RR) statistics.  The detailed reporting may enable a media
   sender to react more appropriately to the observed networking
   conditions as these can be characterized better, although at the
   expense of extra overhead.

   In addition to lost packets, RFC3611 defines the notion of
   "discarded" packets: packets that were received but dropped from the
   de-jitter buffer because they were either too early (for buffering)
   or too late (for playout).  The "discard rate" metric is part of the
   VoIP metrics report block even though it is not just applicable to
   audio: it is specified as the fraction of discarded packets since the
   beginning of the session.  See section 4.7.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].
   The discard metric is believed to be applicable to a large class of
   RTP applications which use a de-jitter buffer RFC5481 [RFC5481].

   Recently proposed extensions to the Extended Reports (XR) reporting
   suggest enhancing this discard metric:

   o  Reporting the number of discarded packets in a measurement
      interval, i.e., during either the last reporting interval or since
      the beginning of the session, as indicated by a flag in the
      suggested XR report [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard].  If an
      endpoint needs to report packet discard due to other reasons than
      early- and late-arrival (for example, discard due to duplication,
      redundancy, etc.)  then it should consider using the Discarded
      Packets Report Block [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard].

   o  Reporting gaps and bursts of discarded packets during a
      measurement interval, i.e., the last reporting interval or the
      duration of the session
      [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-burst-gap-discard].

   o  Reporting run-length encoding of discarded packet during a
      measurement interval, i.e., between a set of sequence numbers
      [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard-rle-metrics].

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR Bytes Discarded             October 2013


   However, none of these metrics allow a receiver to report precisely
   the number of bytes that were discarded.  While this information
   could in theory be derived from high-frequency reporting on the
   number of discarded packets [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard] or
   from the Discard RLE report
   [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard-rle-metrics], these two mechanisms
   do not appear feasible: The former would require an unduly high
   amount of reporting which still might not be sufficient due to the
   non-deterministic scheduling of RTCP packets.  The latter incurs
   significant complexity (by storing a map of sequence numbers and
   packet sizes) and reporting overhead.

   An XR block is defined in this document to indicate the number of
   bytes discarded, per interval or for the duration of the session,
   similar to other XR report blocks.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550] and in the extensions for XR
   reporting [RFC3611] applies.

3.  XR Bytes Discarded Report Block

   The XR Bytes Discarded report block uses the following format which
   follows the model of the framework for performance metric development
   [RFC6390].

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace BDR with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.  Please remove this note prior to
   publication as an RFC.]

   The Interval Metric flag (I) (2 bits) is used to indicate whether the
   discard metric is Interval, or a Cumulative metric, that is, whether
   the reported value applies to the most recent measurement interval
   duration between successive reports (I=10, the Interval Duration) or
   to the accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements
   (I=11, the Cumulative Duration).  Since the bytes discarded are not
   measured at a particular time instance but over one or several
   reporting intervals, the metric MUST NOT be reported as a Sampled
   Metric (I=01).  In addition, the value I=00 is reserved and MUST NOT
   be sent, and MUST be discarded when received.

   The 'E' bit is introduced to distinguish between packets discarded
   due to early arrival and those discarded due to late arrival.  The
   'E' bit is set to '1' if it reports bytes discarded due to early
   arrival and is set to '0' if it reports bytes discarded due to late
   arrival.  If a duplicate packet is received and discarded, these
   duplicate packets are ignored and not reported.  In case both early
   and late discarded packets shall be reported, two Bytes Discarded
   report blocks MUST be included.

   reserved (5 bits): This field is reserved for future definition.  In
   the absence of such definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to
   zero and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   block length (16 bits) MUST be set to 2, in accordance with the
   definition of this field in [RFC3611].  The block MUST be discarded
   if the block length is set to a different value.

   The 'number of bytes discarded' is a 32-bit unsigned integer value
   indicating the total number of bytes discarded.  Bytes discarded
   corresponds to the RTP payload size of every RTP packet that is
   discarded (due to early or late arrival).  Hence, the bytes discarded
   ignores the size of any RTP header extensions and the size of the
   padding bits.  Also the discarded packet is associated to the
   interval in which it was discarded and not when it was expected.

   If Interval Metric flag (I=11) is set, the value in the field
   indicates the number of bytes discarded from the start of the
   session, if Interval Metric flag (I=01) is set, it indicates the
   number of bytes discarded since the last RTCP XR Byte Discarded Block
   was received.

   If the XR block follows a measurement identity block [RFC6776] in the
   same RTCP compound packet then the cumulative (I=11) or the interval

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR Bytes Discarded             October 2013


   (I=10) for this report block corresponds to the values of the
   "measurement duration" in the measurement information block.

   If the receiver sends the Bytes Discarded Report Block without the
   measurement identity block then the discard block MUST be sent in
   conjunction with an RTCP Receiver Report (RR) as a compound RTCP
   packet.

4.  Protocol Operation

   This section describes the behavior of the reporting node (= media
   receiver) and the media sender.

4.1.  Reporting Node (Receiver)

   Transmission of RTCP XR Bytes Discarded Report is up to the
   discretion of the media receiver, as is the reporting granularity.
   However, it is RECOMMENDED that the media receiver signals all
   discarded packets using the method defined in this document.  If all
   packets over a reporting period were discarded, the media receiver
   MAY use the Discard Report Block [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard]
   instead.

   The media receiver MAY send the Bytes Discard Reports as part of the
   regularly scheduled RTCP packets as per RFC3550.  It MAY also include
   Bytes Discard Reports in immediate or early feedback packets as per
   RFC4585.

4.2.  Media Sender

   The media sender MUST be prepared to operate without receiving any
   Bytes Discarded reports.  If Bytes Discarded reports are generated by
   the media receiver, the media sender cannot rely on all these reports
   being received, nor can the media sender rely on a regular generation
   pattern from the media receiver.

   However, if the media sender receives any RTCP reports but no Bytes
   Discard report blocks and is aware that the media receiver supports
   Bytes Discard report blocks, it MAY assume that no packets were
   discarded at the media receiver.

   The media sender SHOULD accept the Bytes Discarded Report Block only
   if it is received in a compound RTCP receiver report or if it is
   preceded by a measurement identity block [RFC6776].  Under all other
   circumstances it MUST ignore the block.

5.  SDP signaling




Singh, et al.            Expires April 04, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR Bytes Discarded             October 2013


   A participant of a media session MAY use SDP to signal its support
   for the report block specified in this document or use them without
   any prior signaling (see section 5 of [RFC3611]).

   For signaling in SDP, the RTCP XR attribute as defined in [RFC3611]
   MUST be used.  The SDP [RFC4566] attribute 'xr-format' defined in
   RFC3611 is augmented as described in the following to indicate the
   bytes discarded metric.

      rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)]
                       CRLF   ; defined in [RFC3611]

      xr-format       =/ xr-discard-bytes

      xr-discard-bytes = "discard-bytes"


   The parameter 'discard-bytes' to indicate support for the Bytes
   Discarded Report Block defined in Section 3.

   When SDP is used in Offer/Answer context, the mechanism defined in
   [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters applies (see
   section 5.2 of [RFC3611]).

6.  Security Considerations

   The Bytes Discarded block does not provide per-packet statistics,
   hence the risk to confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph
   3 of [RFC3611] does not apply.  In some situations, returning very
   detailed error information (e.g., over-range measurement or
   measurement unavailable) using this report block can provide an
   attacker with insight into the security processing.  Implementers
   should consider the guidance in [I-D.ietf-avt-srtp-not-mandatory] for
   using appropriate security mechanisms, i.e., where security is a
   concern, the implementation should apply encryption and
   authentication to the report block.  For example this can be achieved
   by using the AVPF profile together with the Secure RTP profile as
   defined in [RFC3711]; an appropriate combination of the two profiles
   (an "SAVPF") is specified in [RFC5124].  However, other mechanisms
   also exist (documented in [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options])
   and might be more suitable.

   Additionally, The security considerations of [RFC3550], [RFC3611],
   and [RFC4585] apply.

7.  IANA Considerations
