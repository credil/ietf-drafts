      Configuration and service discovery of IPv6 capable sensors
              draft-nieminen-6lowpan-service-discovery-00

Abstract

   The number and type of Internet connected devices continues to grow
   rapidly.  Sensors are a new category of devices that are becoming
   Internet connected.  While sensors have existed for a long time, it
   is only now that we see sensors being capable of communicating via an
   IP stack.  Sensors are used in a multitude of industries and
   applications.  By enabling these devices to be Internet connected,
   they open up new vistas in terms of applications and uses.  Most
   sensors are generally small with minimal power and processing
   capabilities.  The ability to configure these devices is a challenge.
   However, in order to make the usage and deployment of Internet
   connected sensors easier, it is essential that there exist a well
   defined configuration, control, and service discovery mechanism.
   This document illustrates various use cases of sensors in different
   types of deployments and a solution for configuring and controlling
   them in addition to the ability for sensors and devices to discover
   services.

Internet-Draft          Sensor service discovery            October 2011


1.  Introduction

   During the recent years, mechanisms for connecting sensors with the
   Internet of Things (IoT) have been developed and standardized.
   6LoWPAN standard [RFC4944] defines how to run IPv6 over 802.15.4
   family radios (ZigBee, Wireless HART) and [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-btle]
   proposes a solution for adapting 6LoWPAN stack for ultra-low power
   Bluetooth Low Energy (BT-LE).  However, being able to transmit IPv6
   packets is not enough for providing a complete Internet connectivity
   solution for the sensors.  Mechanisms such as sensor configuration,
   control, resource and service discovery are a crucial part of the
   solution.  This document describes the typical communication models
   between sensors and the Internet and discusses the related functional
   and technical requirements.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   Bluetooth Low Energy

      Bluetooth Low Energy is a low power air interface technology
      specified by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG).  BT-LE is
      specified in Revision 4.0 of the Bluetooth specifications (BT
      4.0).

   Gateway

      Network element connecting sensors to the Internet.  Can be e.g a
      home gateway or a mobile device.

   6LR and 6LBR

      These terms correspond to those defined in [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd]

   Watcher

      Network element monitoring the state of the sensors.  Can be e.g a
      server or a mobile device.

2.  Problem statement

   Sensors are generally purpose built devices which have very limited
   processing power, memory or battery life.  There are various types of
   sensors and they can communicate either via a wired or wireless
   interface.  Sensors for detecting temperature, luminescence,
   humidity, hazardous chemicals, heartrate, pulse etc. are just a few
   examples.  They can be used in a variety of industries and
   applications including healthcare, automobile, manufacturing, home
   and enterprise, aviation and agriculture.  As sensors become Internet
   connected, it also brings up the need for them to be configured and
   managed in an easy manner.  The nature of these devices results in
   configuring, controlling and managing them especially challenging.

   The applicability of sensors when Internet connected increases
   dramatically.  However, the problem associated with configuring and
   controlling/managing them needs to be solved in order to make usage
   and deployment easier.  Sensors do not have keyboards or a UI through
   which they can be configured.  The IP stack and capabilities of many
   of these sensors is also very limited.  Hence the problem to be
   solved is primarily about a protocol or method to configure such
   barebone sensors which are capable of connecting to the Internet.


3.  Sensor communication models

   This section presents the typical communication models between
   sensors and the Internet.

3.1.  Local reporting, local consumption

   In this scenario everything happens within a local/private network.
   Sensor sends data to the local server, watcher in the local network
   can access the data.  Sensor can use local-network discovery methods
   to locate the server.

               Figure 1: Local reporting, local consumption

3.2.  Local reporting, remote consumption

   In this scenario the sensor still sends data to a local server.
   However, the watcher can read the data from anywhere.  The server
   needs to be reachable from the Internet (e.g. via a proxy or
   Firewall/NAT bindings).

        +--------------+   /            \   +--------------+    +--------------+
        |   Service    |<--|--Internet---|->|   Server/    |<---|   Sensor     |
        |              |   \_ ___________/  |   Gateway    |    |              |

               Figure 2: Local reporting, remote consumption

3.3.  Local reporting, cloud backend

   In this scenario the sensor still sends data to a local server.  The
   local server acts as a gateway and forwards data to an Internet
   service.  The watcher can obtain data from the service.


                            ____________

3.4.  Cloud service

   In this scenario the sensor communicates directly with the server,
   requiring configuration.  The gateway is transparent and it's main
   role is to forward packets.  The watcher obtains data from the
   service.


                            ____________
        +--------------+   /            \   +--------------+    +--------------+
        |   Service    |<--|-|-Internet--|--|---Server/----|----|   Sensor     |
        |              |   \_|___________/  |   Gateway    |    |              |
        +--------------+     |              +--------------+    +--------------+
                             |
        +--------------+     |
        |   Watcher    |<----|
        |              |
        +--------------+



                          Figure 4: Cloud service

3.5.  Cloud service with control

   This scenario is similar to the previous scenario with the difference
   that the watcher/controller can control the sensor via the service.
   The control can be synchronized with the communication pattern of the
   sensor or it can be asynchronous.

3.6.  Cloud service, direct control

   This scenario is similar to the previous scenario with the difference
   that control can happen directly via the gateway.  The gateway can
   act as a proxy to the sensor.


4.  Sensor configuration

   There has to be a self-initiated self-configuration procedure for the
   initial configuration after sensor start or when the sensor wakes up
   after being turned off for a longer period of time.  One possibility
   is to hard-code basic parameters such as IP address of the service
   and transmission frequency in the sensor.  Even more simple method
   would be to hard-code gateway URI in the sensor.  The URI would
   contain more detailed configuration data.  Reconfiguration can be
   performed using CoAP GET and PUT messages.  Depending on the
   communication model being applied, the service or the gateway can be



Nieminen, et al.         Expires April 23, 2012                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Sensor service discovery            October 2011


   responsible for the reconfiguration.

   In some cases the service or a watcher wants to poll a specific data
   in the sensor cyclically.  This could be done by the service/watcher
   either with a CoAP GET or automatically in a similar fashion as an
   SNMP trap.  Since the same sensor can be connected to several
   services, it could also be useful if n servers may write to the
   configuration database of one sensor after negotiating appropriate
   configuration parameters based on a joint optimization.

   One important case to consider is how to inform changed IP address of
   the gateway or service.  Usually such devices have the possibility to
   get the server IP address from DHCP options.  It might be beneficial
   to provide a CoAP server with similar responsibility on IP addresses.
   If DHCP is used, then the sensor would just have to redo the DHCP
   query after the wake-up (i.e. instead of using names and DNS for
   discovery, DHCP might work for some cases).  I.e. in both cases the
   client would not stuck to specific IP, but would find the IP for a
   name or a service dynamically.  As DNS records have time to live, the
   DHCP information might also have some time to live so that it would
   not have to be rerequested just after short sleep and if point of
   connection to Internet has not changed.


5.  Resource and service discovery

   Besides configuration, it is important to consider how the gateway or
   a watcher can identify names, states and capabilities of objects,
   groups of objects and services (example: identify which sensors are
   attached to an HVAC system of a particular house)

   One possibility is to use a protocol with multicast capability which
   sends out a query within the scope of a gateway or watcher and wait
   for responses from the sensors.  The Sensors should wake up if they
   are in sleep mode and respond to such a query with a response which
   describes the sensors functionality and service provided.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.


7.  Security Considerations

   Configuration and control of sensors have to be done in a secure
   manner.  The ability to hijack a sensor by malicious entities is a
   threat and can be fairly critical depending on the type of sensor and

   application that it is being used in.  Service discovery also needs
   to have security in terms of ensuring that the service is authentic
   and being offered by a valid entity.  Various types of threats exist
   in an environment where sensors are Internet connected and these can
   vary depending on the scenario and method through which the sensor
   obtains connectivity.
