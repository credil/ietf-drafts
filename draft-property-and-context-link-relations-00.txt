Internet-Draft   The property and context Link Relations        May 2013


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined the way of indicating resources on the
   Web. This specification defines link relation types that may be used
   to express the relationships between a resource and associated
   properties or between a resource and it's context.

   The "property" and "context" link relations are intentionally
   generic, and they can be used with multiple media types in a wide
   variety of use cases.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Link Relations

   The following link relations are defined.

3.1.  The "property" Link Relation Type

   When included in a response, the "property" link relation identifies
   a target resource that represents a property of the context resource.

   For example, if a resource represents a photo, that same resource may
   include one ore more links to resources that represent properties of
   that photo.

   Example expressed as a Link header field:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: image/jpeg
     Content-Length: ...
     Link: </photo;title>; rel="property"; title="...",
       </photo;date>; rel="property"; title="..."

   Or expressed as an HTML document:

     <html>
       <head>
         <link href="..." rel="property" title="...">
         <link href="..." rel="property" title="...">
       </head>
       <body>
         ...
       </body>
     </html>

3.2.  The "context" Link Relation Type

   When included in a response, the "context" link relation identifies a
   target resource that represents a context document of which the
   context resource is a member.

   For example, if a resource represents the property of a photo, that
   same resource may include link to a resource which the property
   belongs.

   Example expressed as a Link header field:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: text/plain
     Content-Length: ...
     Link: <...>; rel="context"; title="...",
       <...>; rel="self"; title="..."

   Or expressed as an HTML document:

     <html>
       <head>
         <link href="..." rel="context" title="...">
       </head>
       <body>
         ...
       </body>
     </html>

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the "property" and "context" link relations
   below as per [RFC5988].

4.1.  The Link Relation Registration "property"

   Relation Name:

      property

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource that is a property of the
      resource represented by the context IRI.

   Security considerations:

      Automated agents should take care when this relation crosses
      administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority
      than the current document).

   Reference:

      See Section 3.

4.2.  The Link Relation Registration "context"

   Relation Name:

      context

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource of which the context resource
      is a member.

   Security considerations:

      Automated agents should take care when this relation crosses
      administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority
      than the current document).

   Reference:

      See Section 3.
