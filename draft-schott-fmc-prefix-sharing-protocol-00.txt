                      IPv6 Prefix Sharing Protocol
            draft-schott-fmc-prefix-sharing-protocol-00.txt

Abstract

   IPv6 prefix sharing in policy for convergence applications makes it
   impossible to track individual quality of service requirements for
   each host by the policy server.  In order to enable it, we define a
   protocol which is based on the residential gateway sending some
   parameters such as IPv6 addresses of each host (3GPP UE or fixed
   host) to the edge router.  The edge router in its turn establishes
   IP-CAN sub-session for each host to receive the quality of service
   parameters.  The edge router enforces this quality of service which
   is specific to the host on its traffic both uplink and downlink.
   When the host disconnects or leaves the network, IP-CAN sub-session
   is terminated.

Internet-Draft           Prefix Sharing for FMC                July 2013


1.  Introduction

   As part of Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) standardization,
   convergence or Policy for Convergence (P4C) is being actively
   pursued.  P4C deals with applying 3GPP Policy and Charging Control
   (PCC) to the hosts in a fixed IP network, including the User
   Equipment (UE) accessing the fixed IP network from home or from a
   public WiFi access [TS23.203], [TR23.896].

   A number of use cases have been documented that exhibit the issue of
   uniquely identifying a host among many hosts sharing the same IP
   address [I-D.boucadair-intarea-host-identifier-scenarios].  However,
   all these use cases involve IPv4 and Network Address Translation
   (NAT) [RFC2663].  An IPv6 related use case belongs to Policy for
   Convergence (P4C) area in Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC)
   [I-D.sarikaya-fmc-prefix-sharing-usecase].  The problem occurs when
   more than one host are assigned IPv6 addresses by local device, e.g.
   Residential Gateway (RG), sharing the same IPv6 prefix without
   interaction with the Edge router where the PCC interface is
   terminated.  In such a case, PCC can not apply host specific quality
   of service for each host.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Policy for Convergence Architecture

   When a host, e.g.  Local_Host_1 in Figure 1 attaches to a routed
   Residential Gateway, RG uses DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation as Requesting
   Router (RR) to request a prefix, possibly of size /60 for home
   network.  The edge router acts as the Delegating Router (DR).  So the
   edge router assigns the IPv6 prefix to the RG.  Note that the host
   can be both 3GPP UE and Fixed device, e.g.  PC, IPTV STB,etc.

   The edge router next initiates an IP Connectivity Access Network (IP-
   CAN) session with the policy server, a.k.a.  Policy and Charging
   Rules Function (PCRF) to receive the Quality of Service (QoS)
   parameters.  Edge router provides IPv6 Prefix and User Equipment (UE)
   ID which in this case is equal to the home network line ID.  IP-CAN
   session establishment completes with the policy server sending IP CAN
   Session Establishment Ack to RG.

   Edge Router binds the IP Subscriber Session for RG with the IP-CAN

   session identified by RG ID, IPv6 Prefix.  Edge Router applies
   admission control and quality of service policy based on the
   parameters received from the policy server during the IP-CAN session
   establishment.

   3GPP UE has to be authenticated.  In this case EAP-AKA authentication
   method is used.  RG is the authenticator and AAA server is in 3GPP
   network.  At the end of a successful authentication, UE receives its
   host id, i.e.  Network Access Identifier (NAI) in User-Name attribute
   .  Host id contains International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)
   and is in Root NAI format defined in [TS23.003].  Root NAI takes the
   form of "0IMSI@nai.epc.mncMNC.mccMCC.3gppnetwork.org" for EAP AKA
   authentication, i.e. if the IMSI is 234150999999999 ( mobile country
   code MCC = 234, mobile network code MNC = 15), the root NAI then
   takes the form as
   0234150999999999@nai.epc.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org for EAP AKA
   authentication.

   In case of stateless address auto configuration, the host sends a
   Router Solicitation message to RG and RG sends a Router Advertisement
   with an IPv6 prefix, the home network prefix.  The host creates an
   128-bit IPv6 address using this prefix and adding its interface id.
   Having completed the address configuration, the host can start
   communication with the Internet to use the Internet services.

   Another host, e.g. non-3GPP Visiting Host 1 attaches to RG and also
   establishes an IPv6 address using the home network prefix.  Edge
   router is not involved with this and all other such address
   assignments.  In this case no authentication is performed.  So the
   host does not receive a host id from 3GPP network.

   The above operation steps assumed that stateless address auto
   configuration (SLAAC) is used.  DHCPv6 based stateful address
   assignment can also be used.  In case of routed RG, RG can be DHCPv6
   relay agent communicating with a DHCPv6 server in the operator's IP
   network.  DHCPv6 server in assigning IPv6 addresses to the hosts uses
   a method where /64 prefixes are never shared between hosts in
   different home networks.

               Figure 1: Policy for Convergence Architecture

   The RG does not signal to the edge router the IP6 address assigned to
   a host, e.g. visiting host 1 or 2, so the edge router acting as
   Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) is not able to start
   an 3GPP IP-CAN session for the given host ID, IPv6 Address
   corresponding to each single host, i.e. the Local_Host_1 and visiting
   host 1 or 2.

   Each host in the home network creates an IPv6 address which is global
   and this address can be used to identify the hosts traffic and would
   enable PCEF to enforce the proper QoS after establishing an IP-CAN
   session to download the required parameters.  UE id given to the
   mobile network in Section 3 is the home network line id which is the
   same for all the hosts in the home network.


4.  Policy for Convergence Solution Overview

   In the first phase of the solution, for a 3GPP UE, RG sends IPv6
   address of the host and the host id as received from 3GPP network
   during authentication in Address Registration Request message to the
   edge router.  The timing of this message could be:

   After SLAAC is completed, e.g. after sending neighbor solicitation
   message with Target Address is set to the address being checked, in
   this case the Target Address is the address that RG sends,

   After DHCPv6 address configuration is completed, in this case IPv6
   address in IA Address option (OPTION_IAADDR) is the address that RG
   sends

   After receiving the first unicast packet from the host, in this case
   the source address of the packet is the address that RG sends.

   RG receives an Address Registration Reply message and checks the
   code.  If the value is zero then the request has succeeded.

   After the address registration at the edge router, the edge router
   goes ahead and communicates with the policy server and gets the
   quality of service parameters for each host separately. for this
   purpose the edge router establishes an IP-CAN sub-session as part of
   the main session RG has established with the policy server separately
   for each host [TR23.896].

   For 3GPP UE, during IP-CAN sub-session establishment, the edge router
   includes the International mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) as part
   of the host id.  The edge router also sends IPv6 address as the new
   parameter.

   In case of non-3GPP hosts, during IP-CAN sub-session establishment,
   the edge router includes RG-ID or line id and IPv6 address as new
   parameters.  It also includes IPv6 prefix.

   The policy server obtains the subscriber's profile related to the
   host.  The policy router sends the default QoS of the subscriber and
   some other information to the edge router.

   IP-CAN sub-session is established between the edge router and the
   policy server.  Over this session, the policy server gets informed
   about the quality of service related events.  The session remains
   open until the session is removed as requested by the edge router.

   The edge router repeats the above procedures for each host that
   shared the address.


5.  P4C Solution Protocol

   Residential Gateway first uses the address registration message
   exchange to register the addresses of the hosts sharing the prefix.
   The edge router establishes an IP-CAN session with the policy router
   for each such host.

   Edge router gets QoS parameters for each host.  Edge router enforces
   the QoS for each host in the active traffic.

   When the hosts disconnect or leave the network, the edge router
   terminates IP-CAN sub-session for each host.

   octets.

   Sequence Number: The value in the reply MUST match the value in the
   corresponding request.

   Code: A value indicating the result of the Address Request.  A value
   of zero (0) indicates successful operation.  Any other value
   indicates an unsuccessful operation.

   Parameters: IPv4 or IPv6 address and Host Id.  Optional field.


7.  Securing Address Registration Protocol

   When address registration protocol is used between the residential
   gateway and the edge router, there is no need for additional security
   mechanisms.  This is because RG to edge router communication happens
   over a secured (IPSEC or other mechanisms) tunnel.

   When address registration protocol is used between the residential
   gateway and a generic server such as a web server, the protocol MUST
   be secured.  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol can be
   used to secure it.  DTLS version 1.2 is defined in [RFC6347].  DTLS
   is Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 [RFC5246] over datagram
   transport.

   DTLS handshake protocol starts with a stateless cookie exchange in
   which the client, Residential Gateway sends ClientHello message and
   the server replies with HelloVerifyRequest message which contains a

   cookie.  The client sends ClientHello this time with the cookie.
   This phase allows the server to verify that Cookie is valid and that
   the client can receive packets at the given IP address.  Note that
   this phase has been added to DTLS and does not exists in TLS.

   DTLS handshake protocol continues with essentially the same TLS
   exchanges such as ServerHello, Certificate, ServerKeyExchange,
   CertificateRequest and ServerHelloDone messages by the server and
   Certificate, ClientKeyExchange, CertificateVerify and (Client)
   Finished messages.  With these messages, the client and server
   exchanges signed certificates, authenticate each other and select a
   cipher suite to be used to secure the communication between the two.
   The server replies with ChangeCipherSpec to notify the client that
   subsequent records will be protected under the newly negotiated
   CipherSpec and keys and (Server) finished message which terminates
   the full handshake.

   DTLS session-resuming handshake which is executed after the keys
   expire is much simpler.  The client sends Client Hello to which the
   server replies with ServerHello, ChangeCipherSpec and Finished
   message.  The client sends ChangeCipherSpec and Finished message to
   complete the handshake.


8.  IANA Considerations

   Two type values are needed to be assigned, one for the address
   request and another for the reply message.


9.  Security Considerations

   Any security considerations arising from Policy for Convergence are
   TBD.
