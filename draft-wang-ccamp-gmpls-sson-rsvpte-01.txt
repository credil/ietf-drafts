   RSVP-TE Extensions for GMPLS control of Spectrum Switched Optical
                            Networks (SSONs)
               draft-wang-ccamp-gmpls-sson-rsvpte-01.txt

Abstract

   A new architecture of optical transport networks which is addressed
   in the newest version of G.872 is being developed in ITU-T SG15.
   Compared with previous G.872 technology, this new technology allows
   the switch of group of optical channels as a whole.

   Since current control plane technology isn't able to control this
   kind of application, this document describes the signaling extension
   to support the control of frequency slot channel (i.e., group of
   optical channels).  This document also addresses the interworking
   between WSON optical channel and SSON (Spectrum Switched Optical
   Network) optical channel.

Internet-Draft      Spectrum Switched Optical Network           Jul 2012


1.  Introduction

   In the newest version of G.872, a new kind of spectrum utilization
   and implementation way is introduced to current optical network.
   That is, a chunk of contiguous spectrum which is occupied by a group
   of "express" channels can be forwarded via wide-band filters as a
   whole without filtering and switching everything down to the
   individual OCh (Optical Channel) level in long-haul systems.
   Compared with narrowband, wideband filters and switching has many
   advantages, for example, building OCh Signals for management
   convenience, maximizing the reach and traversing more nodes.  Optical
   channels included in the group may have different sizes (more than
   one OCh signal fits into a slot).  From the perspective of management
   plane and control plane, hierarchy exists between the channels and
   optical channel group (frequency slot channel).

   Detailed description about this kind of spectrum utilization and
   implementation way could be found in the following sections base on
   the terminology defined in ITU-T.

   GMPLS protocol extensions are needed to help manage this kind of
   spectrum utilization and implementation way.  This document first
   describes the layer model base on the hierarchy between optical
   channels (OCh) and optical channel group (frequency slot channel)
   from management plane or control plane perspective and defines
   signaling protocol extension to support the control of frequency slot
   channel.  As the flexible grid framework document describes both the
   frequency slot channel and optical channel, this document also give a
   detail description about the interworking between WSON optical
   channel and SSON (Spectrum Switched Optical Network) optical channel.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   o  Frequency slot: As defined by Q6 in clause 3.1.2 of G.694.1, a
      frequency slot is a frequency range which is allocated to a slot
      and unavailable to other slots within a flexible grid.  A
      frequency slot is defined by its nominal central frequency and its
      slot width.  Detailed description can be found in the framework
      document.

Internet-Draft      Spectrum Switched Optical Network           Jul 2012


   o  Wavelength Range: [RFC6163] gives a description of this
      terminology.Wavelength range given a mapping between labels and
      the ITU-T grids, each range could be expressed in terms of a
      tuple, (lambda1, lambda2) or (freq1, freq2), where the lambdas or
      frequencies can be represented by 32-bit integers.

   o  Nominal central frequency (of a frequency slot) - as used by Q6 in
      G.694.1.  [Note: This parameter is associated with a grid position
      on the fixed grid and a slot in the flexible grid.]

   o  Central frequency - this parameter is associated with an optical
      signal.  It is the nominal mid-point of the optical frequency
      range over which the digital information of the particular OCh
      payload is modulated.

   o  Single signal frequency slot: A frequency slot assigned to a
      single optical signal (that carries a single OCh payload)

   o  Frequency Slot Channel: as defined in the newest version of G.872,
      the Optical Channel Signal is switched by analogue elements
      (matrices) and may be switched in larger pieces of spectrum than
      that occupied by a single optical channel (optical channel slot).
      The channel that may carry multiple optical channel signals is
      called a Frequency Slot Channel.

   o  Fiber Frequency Slot: the total allocable spectrum on a fiber.

   o  SSON: Spectrum-Switched Optical Network.  This concept and
      definition is introduced from the framework document.  An optical
      network in which a data plane connection is switched based on an
      optical spectrum frequency slot of a variable slot width, rather
      than based on a fixed grid and fixed slot width.

   o  OCh Frequency Slot: The spectrum allocated to transport a single
      OCh signal.

   o  Waveguide: anything that constrains the E/M radiation and guides
      the E/M energy to its destination is a waveguide; copper pairs,
      coaxial pairs and optical fibers are all waveguides.

   o  Media layer: media layer is described as the bottom of the client
      server recursion.

   o  Media path: a path through a waveguide can be called media path.

3.  Requirements and Modeling of SSON

3.1.  Hierarchy between Optical Channel and Frequency Slot Channel

   Spectrum may be allocated in larger and contiguous piece than a
   single OCh slot which is called Frequency Slot.  Frequency Slot
   Channel can be described as an optical media path (i.e., waveguide)
   with a nominal center frequency and slot width across a sequence of
   network elements.  The concatenation of all media elements between
   two points is called a Frequency Slot Channel.  A frequency slot
   channel is such an optical channel group that more than one optical
   channel slot can be carried in and transport.  SSON allows both
   frequency slot channel switching and optical channel switching.

   [Note: The term "channel" here implies all the media between two
   points.]

   Frequency Slot channels can be switched in a Frequency Slot Matrix.
   The Frequency Slot Matrix Connection is described as an optical
   matrix connection from one fiber to another that has a given nominal
   center frequency and slot width.  The Frequency Slot Matrix
   connection may interconnect one or more Frequency Slot Channels,
   which in turn may carry one or more OCh signals.  Establishing a
   Frequency Slot Matrix Connection will limit the connectivity of an
   OCh signal over that network element within the spectral band of that
   matrix connection to be between the input and output fibers of that
   Frequency Slot Matrix Connection.  The slots allocated to a single
   OCh signal is called OCh slot.

   In the case where the switching granularity of the Frequency Slot
   Matrix allows for independent switching of each OCh, it can be
   decided as a matter of policy that a request to establish an OCh
   connection will, internal to the NE, establish a Frequency Slot
   Matrix Connection of the same spectral width, and the Frequency Slot
   Matrix Connection can be released when the OCh connection is
   released.

   The Frequency Slot channel is a topological construct which is
   modeled from management perspective and can be chosen for convenience
   of managing and describing the network.  A frequency slot channel
   represents a piece of spectrum supported by a concatenation of media
   elements (e.g. fiber, filters, amplifier).  More than one optical
   channel signal can be carried in a frequency slot channel.  As the
   frequency slots and Optical channel are of different sizes, hierarchy
   exists between them, current optical transport network can be modeled
   into two layers and managed independently from the perspective of
   management, one is optical channel layer and the other is frequency
   slot channel layer.  Frequency slots channel and optical channel

Internet-Draft      Spectrum Switched Optical Network           Jul 2012


   signals can be managed independently.  A frequency slot channel can
   be switched as a whole by the frequency slot matrix without the need
   to look into every optical channel.

   [Notes: We are not going to address the OEO and wavelength converter
   that may exist in a frequency slot channel, as current version of
   G.872 doesn't cover the optical frequency changer along the frequency
   slot channel.]

3.2.  Switching Type

   Switching type can be used to indicate the type of switching that
   should be performed on a particular link.  According to the modeling
   in the previous section, a new value should be defined to indicate
   the switching capability of frequency slot channel layer.

3.3.  Frequency Slot Channel

3.3.1.  Label Format

   Section 3.3 of [RFC3471] defines waveband switching: "A waveband
   represents a set of contiguous wavelengths which can be switched
   together to a new waveband".  This is similar to the frequency slot
   channel switching, because they both switch multiple wavelengths or
   spectrum as a unit.

   But the wavelength label defined in [RFC3471] only has significance
   between neighbors, in order to control the setup and release of
   frequency slot channel with RSVP-TE signaling, a new frequency slot
   channel label which has definite information of nominal central
   frequency and slot width of the spectrum is needed.  This chunk of
   spectrum can be used for subsequent setup of optical channel path.

3.3.2.  Traffic Parameters

   In current network, like MPLS network, OTN network, signaling can be
   used to reserve bandwidth at each node along the path when set up
   LSPs.  The bandwidth information describes the end-to-end traffic
   characteristic of a LSP, so the signaling SHOULD be able to carry
   bandwidth information that a LSP need to occupy.

   In the process of the setup of frequency slot channel, the most
   critical traffic characteristic of a LSP is spectrum, i.e., the
   spectrum width that a LSP can occupy.  For example, if a third party
   wants to manage and operate a chunk of spectrum by itself, carrier
   could use the signaling to set up a frequency slot channel with a
   specific spectrum width to satisfy the requirement.  Carrier doesn't
   care how this spectrum can be used by the party and how many data

Internet-Draft      Spectrum Switched Optical Network           Jul 2012


   this chunk of spectrum can bear.

   According to the previous description, when we use signaling to set
   up a frequency slot channel, spectrum resource information (i.e.,
   spectrum width) should be carried in the signaling to reserve the
   spectrum resource along the path.

3.3.3.  Grid Attributes of Forwarding Adjacency

   Frequency slot matrix connection may interconnect one or more
   frequency slot channels, which in turn may carry one or more OCh
   signals.  In the case the frequency slot matrix just allow the
   switching of spectrum as a whole, internal grid attributes should not
   be known by the forwarding adjacency end points.

3.4.  Optical Channel

   [Notes: This section mainly addresses the current status of optical
   channel, including WSON optical channel signal and SSON optical
   channel signal.  We will decouple this part and submit another
   document if people think optical channel and frequency slot channel
   belong to different layer and they have different signaling format,
   so they should be decouple from each other.]

3.4.1.  Overview of Flexible Grid and Fixed Grid

   GMPLS and PCE control of fixed grid network (i.e., WSON, Wavelength
   Switched Optical Network) is close to mature in IETF CCAMP, while
   flexible grid control plane technology is still being developed in
   IETF.  This section mainly focuses on the interconnection between
   WSON optical channel signal and SSON optical channel signal.

3.4.2.  Interwork between WSON signal and SSON signal

   Some open issues are listed in the recent flexible grid framework
   document and still need to be resolved if we want to push the
   framework document forward.  Part of these issues which may have
   relation to the interwork between SSON and WSON are listed here:

   1).  If a new switching capability is needed to represent SSON
   optical channel layer?

   2).  Potential problems with having the same switching capability but
   the label format changes compared with WSON optical channel layer.

   3).  Role of LSP encoding type?  I think the issue listed here
   intends to say if a new LSP encoding type is needed for flexible grid
   optical channel layer.

Internet-Draft      Spectrum Switched Optical Network           Jul 2012


   4).  Notion of hierarchy?  There is no notion of hierarchy between
   flexible grid OCh and fixed grid OCh.

   Just from my perspective, I think SSON optical channel layer should
   use the same switching capability as WSON optical channel layer.
   Some words are given here to describe my opinion.  A LSP which has a
   bandwidth of 50GHz pass through both WSON network and SSON network.
   We assume that no OEOs exist in the LSP, so both the WSON optical
   channel path and SSON optical channel path occupy 50GHz.  From the
   perspective of data plane, there is no change of the signal and no
   multiplexing when the WSON optical channel path interconnects with
   SSON optical channel path.  From this scenario we can conclude that
   both WSON optical channel layer and SSON optical channel layer belong
   to the same layer.  No notion of hierarchy exists between them.  Base
   on these words, I think both WSON optical channel layer and SSON
   optical channel layer should use the same switching capability.

   The previous words mention the issues 1) and 4).  Another two issues
   are to be discussed in the following description in the process of
   path setup.

   Because there is no notion of hierarchy exists between WSON optical
   channel layer and SSON optical channel layer, hierarchy LSP which is
   addressed in [RFC4206] and [RFC6107] can't be applied.  But stitching
   LSP which is described in [RFC5150] can be applied in one layer.  LSP
   hierarchy allows more than one LSP to be mapped to an H-LSP, but in
   case of S-LSP, at most one LSP may be associated with an S-LSP.  This
   is similar to the scenario of interconnection between WSON OCh LSP
   and SSON OCh LSP.  Similar to an H-LSP, an S-LSP could be managed and
   advertised, although it is not required, as a TE link, either in the
   same TE domain as it was provisioned or a different one.  Path setup
   procedure of stitching LSP can be applied in the scenario of
   interconnection between WSON optical channel path and SSON optical
   channel path.


4.  Signaling Protocol Extensions to Support Control of SSON

   This section mainly addresses the signaling protocol extension in
   support of the control of spectrum-switched optical netwrok and the
   facilitating of the setup of forwarding adjacency in G.872 optical
   transport network.

   A new switching type is needed.

4.2.  Label Format Extensions of Frequency Slot Channel Layer

   According to the description in the section 3.2, label should be able
   to describe the frequency slot characteristic in order to facilitate
   the switch of this large piece of spectrum.  Label format of flexible

   channel.

   The meaning of C.S. and identifier is maintained from [RFC6205].

   Similar to the definition in
   [draft-farrkingel-ccamp-flexigrid-lambda-label], n is used to
   identify the central frequency, and m (16bits) is used to identify
   slot width of the frequency slot channel.

   [Notes: here we use 16 bits to represent the "m" value, because 8
   bits are not enough for the setup of frequency slot channel with
   large spectrum.]

4.3.  Traffic Parameters of Frequency Slot Channel Layer

   Similar to the original signaling which carry the information of
   bandwidth that a LSP may reserve at each node along the path,
   signaling that is used to set up frequency slot channel SHOULD be

5.  Signaling Procedures

5.1.  RSVP-TE Signaling Procedures to Support the Setup of Frequency
      Slot Channel

5.1.1.  Centralized Spectrum Assignment

   In this case, both of the route and the frequency slot information
   (i.e., central frequency and spectrum width) are provided by the PCE
   or ingress node.  When signaling a LSP, the assigned label
   information is carried in the ERO label sub-object which is addressed
   in [RFC3473].  When the nodes along the LSP receive the path message
   carrying the ERO and ERO label sub-object, the procedure of path
   setup is the same as the procedure which is described in [RFC3473]
   and [RFC4003].  RRO and RRO label sub-object are used to record the
   label information of the egress.

5.1.2.  Distributed Spectrum Assignment

   In this case, only the route is provided by a PCE or ingress node
   before the signaling procedure.  The available spectrum SHALL be
   collected hop by hop and the egress node SHOULD select a proper label
   for the LSP.  After the route is computed, the ingress node SHOULD
   find out the available spectrum for the LSP on the next link of the
   route.

   Then a path message is sent to the next node along the path according
   to the route information.  The path message MUST contain a
   Sender_Tspec object to specify the spectrum width of the frequency
   slot channel.  A Label_set object SHALL be added to the path message,
   which contains the candidate available spectrum for the LSP on the

Internet-Draft      Spectrum Switched Optical Network           Jul 2012


   next link.

   When an intermediate node receives the path message, it can deserve
   the spectrum width information from the Sender_Tspec object.  Then it
   SHOULD find the available spectrum for the LSP on the next link of
   the route similar to the ingress node.  The common part of the two
   available spectrum sets.  If the new set is null, the path message
   SHALL be rejected by a patherr message.  Otherwise, the Label_set
   object in the path message SHALL be updated according to the new set
   and the path message is forwarded to the next node according to the
   route.

   When an egress node receives a path message, it SHOULD select an
   available spectrum from the Label_set object based on local policy
   and determine the frequency slot channel base on the spectrum width
   and the available spectrum.  Then a Resv message is responded so that
   the nodes along the LSP can establish the optical cross-connect based
   on the Label object which is determined by the spectrum width in the
   traffic parameters and the available spectrum in the Label_set
   object.

5.2.  Interconnection between WSON signal and SSON signal

   The path setup procedure of WSON OCh interworking with SSON OCh can
   be described as follows:

   Let's take the example of [RFC5150] into consideration.


                        e2e LSP
                  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++> (LSP1-2)

                            LSP segment (flexi-LSP)
                          ====================> (LSP-AB)
                              C --- E --- G
                             /|\    |   / |\
                            / | \   |  /  | \
                  R1 ---- A \ |  \  | /   | / B --- R2
                             \|   \ |/    |/
                              D --- F --- H

             fixed grid --A-- flexi-grid    --B-- fixed grid

                          Figure 4: stitching LSP


   In this scenario, R1 and R2 are traditional WSON signal capable
   nodes, A and B are both WSON signal and SSON signal capable nodes,

   the other nodes are only SSON capable nodes.  We assume that a
   40Gbit/s LSP from R1 to R2 needs to be set up.

   Node R1 prepares signaling path message for the end-to-end path setup
   from R1 to the destination node R2.  Before R1 sends path message, R1
   should send a path computation request to the path computation
   element in order to compute an end-to-end path from R1 to R2.  Path
   computation response message from PCE to R1 contains ERO and label
   information.  Here we may classify the scenarios into two cases:
   R1/R2 and the other nodes are in the same AS, R1/R2 and the other
   nodes are not in the same AS.

   In this scenario of interconnection between WSON OCh and SSON OCh, I
   think dynamic stitching LSP setup is frequent, static stitching LSP
   configuration may not be needed here.

   1).  R1/R2 and the other nodes are in the same AS:

   R1 encapsulates the path message which contains ERO to explicitly
   indicate the path and label used and RRO to record the path traversed
   and label used by node traversed.  Then R1 sends the path message to
   the next hop node A. Here we assume path computation element is
   capable of fixed grid and flexible grid path computation, and the ERO
   contain the path information (R1, A, B, R2).  When the path message
   arrives at node A, node A verifies the path message and finds
   incomplete ERO information, then send another path computation
   request message to the PCE in order to obtain the whole path
   information.  PCE sends path computation response message which
   contain ERO (A, D, F, H, B) and label information.  Here the label is
   flexible label information which is addressed in [draft-farrkingel].

   To facilitate the control of stitching LSP boundaries, we may use a
   different encoding type for flexible grid to help control.  Encoding
   type can be used to help stitching LSP boundaries control.  Stitching
   LSP boundaries control looks like FA-LSP boundaries control, but has
   many differences.

   After matching the switching type and encoding type of the interface,
   Node A blocks the signaling process and decides to set up a stitching
   LSP according to the flexible grid LSP setup procedure using another
   signaling process.  Procedure for set up stitching LSP can be found
   in RFC5150.  The stitching LSP can be seen as a TE link in the fixed
   grid network.  After the setup of stitching LSP between A and B, A
   then continues the blocking signaling procedure and sends the path
   message to the next hop B directly and finishes the end-to-end LSP.

   2).  R1/R2 and the other nodes are in different AS:

   From signaling perspective, path setup in this scenario is similar to
   that in the last scenario.  If A is a domain boundary node, A can
   decide to set up a stitching LSP according to local configuration or
   match of the switching type and encoding type when the R1-R2 path
   message arrives at boundary node A. Path-key technology which is
   addressed in [RFC5520] can be used here to help setup of the path.
