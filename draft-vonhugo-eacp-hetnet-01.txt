Internet-Draft     Energy Aware Control Approach for QoS       July 2013


1.  Introduction

   Major challenge for carrier grade network operators trying to reduce
   power consumption in the access domain is to grant customer
   satisfaction in terms of only minimum degraded service quality. This
   requires the network to meet the specified and agreed performance
   figures demanded by various applications using network connectivity.
   Energy saving by load-adaptive provision of transmission capacity in
   terms of switch-on and -off of resources (nodes, lines, node
   components) or dynamic invocation of sleep modes may result in
   performance degradation from reduced capacity or coverage and
   introduce overhead for re-activation and reconfiguration.
   Therefore intelligent mechanisms for network
   operation control have to be applied to find optimum decision in
   terms of timeliness and accuracy to perform the reconfigurations
   such that the actually provided capacity ensures as much as possible
   a successful transmission of user traffic demand at required quality.

   Degradations in user perceived service quality depend on the service
   specific requirements in terms of e.g. bandwidth, packet loss rate,
   delay and delay variations which are governed both by the kind of
   service (e.g. audio, video, file transfer, ...) as well as equipment
   and application software specific measures to cope with network
   performance variations.  Thus for video streaming services such as
   IPTV countermeasures to cope with variable bandwidth and delay are
   implemented such as buffers to store data (see e.g [4]).

   This draft reports an approach following the considerations and
   requirements laid out in [2] to counteract the potential impact due
   to energy aware network operation, which is represented as bandwidth
   reduction, introduced stretch/delay, decreased recovery speed,
   additional jitter/delay variations, and other operational aspects.

   Issues of power-aware routing and traffic engineering have already
   been considered in [8] and [9] in detail.

3.  Energy aware network operation


3.1. Network model

   The proposed concept for load adaptive energy aware access networks
   follows a model similar to [2] where the following measures are
   described as primary ways to reduce energy usage 

   o  Removing redundant links from the network topology
   o  Removing redundant network equipment from the network topology
   o  Reducing the amount of time equipment or links are operational
   o  Reducing the link speed or processing rate of equipment

   Whereas the first two actions describe permanent changes to the 
   network the latter two are considered for dynamical adaptation of 
   network capacity to the temporally variable traffic demand as
   addressed here.

   Considerations here shall focus on a network for fixed and mobile 
   services such as DSL-based (digital subscriber line) fixed access as
   described by BBF or a cellular access network as specified by 3GPP.
   Technology specific approaches towards an energy aware operation are
   laid out e.g. in [3] for mobile access where some cells providing
   additional capacity are proposed to be switched off for reasons of
   power consumption optimization in case they are no longer needed.
   Important is that both continuity of radio coverage and service QoS
   remains guaranteed. 

   A local-autonomous solution for fixed DSL networks' energy efficiency  
   improvements is laid out e.g. in [10] where the data rate and the
   power consumption associated with it are adapted to real traffic
   demands observed on a particular access line by means of defined
   bit rate and power modes. 
 
   A multi-link heterogeneous access network consisting of multiple
   radio access technologies (Multi-RAT) such as cellular mobile and
   WiFi is able to provide an end user equipment (UE) with multiple 
   links concurrently or subsequently to enable continuous network 
   connectivity.  Depending on current load within an area of coverage
   (radio cell) part of the access nodes (i.e. radio base stations and
   WiFi access points) are temporarily switched off either completely
   or partially thus realizing the above mentioned measures. 

   Similarly, a hybrid fixed-radio access network is conceivable where  
   the specifics of the per-technology power management solutions have  
   to be taken into account and in addition they have to be coordinated. 

   The simplistic network model used in [2] is shown in Figure 1.

3.2. Problem description 


   Task of the control plane to prevent ongoing sessions from negative
   impact of network performance variations to user perceived service
   quality or Quality of Experience (QoE) is to detect and counteract 
   those variations resulting in bandwidth reduction, and additional
   delay and jitter.  On the other hand a decreased recovery speed in
   case of (e.g. failure caused) loss of remaining redundant links and
   nodes is more a network operational issue with impact on network
   availability and reliability.

   The approach described here focusses on the well known situation
   that a network is dimensioned so to provide enough capacity to serve
   all users and services expected in so-called busy hours when multiple
   users are concurrently active at peak demands.  During off-peak time
   the demanded network load is low so that part of the network in terms
   of access nodes and routers can be operated in sleep mode or switched
   off partially or completely.

   For a cellular network we therefore may assume that a UE is
   potentially being served by at least two such access nodes whereas in
   a fixed network customer nodes can be switched to low power mode
   reducing capacity and energy consumption both at the UE and in the
   the AR (here: DSL Access Multiplexer, DSLAM).  Such a behaviour is
   denoted as load adaptive network reconfiguration.

   The concept allowing for adaptive reconfiguration is based on
   reliable measurement of actual traffic demand and subsequent decision
   on corresponding configuration actions.  Therefore a data base and
   decision engine is employed to collect and analyse context
   information allowing for best decisions on changes in network
   topology and configuration.  An optimization is achieved when
   provided capacity follows as much as possible the traffic demand with
   as little overprovisioning as possible to grant energy efficient
   operation and account for enough margin to cope with traffic demand
   uncertainties in terms of load variability to prevent perceivable
   quality degradations.

   Such quality impact may be introduced by network performance
   degradations in terms of congestion and bandwidth reduction in case
   of mismatch between capacity and demand.  In addition the energy
   aware network operation may introduce bandwidth reduction, stretch/
   delay, additional jitter/delay variations as laid out in [2].  In a
   cellular system additional delay or even loss of connectivity due to
   handover of an UE between neighboring access nodes may occur when the
   currently serving node is going to energy save state.  New proposals
   for mobility management taking into account both low handover delay
   and resource efficient operation are under way in WG DMM (Distributed
   Mobility Management) [5].

   Impact of all these parameters on different services according to
   their requirements have to be considered and counteracted for
   customer satisfaction.  A communication network operating in an
   energy aware mode SHOULD apply additional measures to keep track of
   network node and link states as well as of service related network
   performance to minimize risk of degradations in service quality. 


3.3. Solution space

   For energy efficient network operation with minimum power consumption
   at imperceptible degradation of the service quality as experienced by

   the user a control plane framework with data base and decision engine
   is required.  Task of this framework is to monitor the network status
   (or detect changes in the network status) and track the service
   demand to assign the network resources (i.e. alter network topology
   or configuration) in such a way that both power consumption is
   reduced and user demands are satisfied (in terms of only minimal QoS
   degradations which are hardly experienced by the user).

   A simplified exemplary realisation of such a framework (i.e. data
   base DB and decision engine DE) would have to cooperate with the
   Network Mangement (NM) and Service Management (SM) as is specified
   e.g. by 3GPP in [13] for mobile cellular networks.  Such a setting
   shall enable context information exchange between network elements as
   AR1, AR2, or AGR, GW (via signalling protocols towards NM, which are
   shown in Figure 3 as dotted lines) as well as user equipment UE and
   the DB o the framework.  The abstracted context data (dashed arrows)
   together with other internal data (e.g. based on policies) and
   external (3rd party) information (not shown in Figure 3) are fed into
   the data base.  The corresponding reconfiguration decision is made in
   decision entity DE considering also further data from NM and SM.
   Authorised commands to change the network configuration and topology
   are sent by NM to the network entities.

Internet-Draft      Energy Aware Control Approach for QoS      July 2013

   
   One approach is to apply a dedicated control protocol or enhance
   existing ones like SNMP [14] and NETCONF protocol [15] when taking
   into account both network status and performance.  On the other hand
   based on a metric to assess the service performance in relation to
   current demand to efficiently assign the required network resources
   considerations as laid down in [16] MAY apply.

   Concrete measures to prevent expected performance degradations could
   make use of prioritization of critical sessions and corresponding
   de-priorisation of more robust ones based e.g. on QoS class
   parameters as specified by DiffServ [11].  In case of switching on
   new equipment to provide additional capacity the introduced delay
   variation may be counteracted by providing spare capacity for those
   services which are highly sensitive to delay variations.

   In the context of mobility handling (e.g. during handover towards
   more energy efficient technology i.e. here between cellular and WiFi)
   application of DiffServ QoS attributes and corresponding parameters
   and mapping to technology specific figures for flows of active
   sessions has been proposed in [17].

   Furthermore energy related information on network devices as defined
   in [12] for network management purposes SHOULD be incorporated in a
   concept to control assessment of QoS requirements of different
   services with respect to impact of energy aware networks.

   Simulations and testbed implementations of load-adaptive measures to
   increase access network energy efficient indicate savings in the
   order of 30% depending on the actual topoplogy and device
   capabilities to support fast reliable on-/off-switching of nodes and
   node components (see e.g. [6]).

5.  Security Considerations

   Security is an important issue in access to communication networks 
   both in fixed-line networks and for mobile and wireless ones as
   described e.g. in [5] such that any proposed protocol must
   incorporate sufficiently strong protection mechanisms.  Since the
   proposed control plane framework interoperates with the network and
   service management system the proper operation of which is essential
   for a network operator, careful examination of security issues in
   relation to corresponding interfaces and protocols is required.
   Beside that to our knowledge no new security risks are introduced
   with this concept.
