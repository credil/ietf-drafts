Internet-Draft          Traceroute Ping Extension          February 2012


1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Traceroute and Ping are two most commonly used tools created since
   the dawn of the Internet in the diagnosis of network problems.  This
   document proposes the mechanism by which the traceroute probe
   messages and ICMP echo request/reply messages can be extended to
   include other user information various applications may want to
   include; and it can be optionally authenticated by the receiving
   node(s).  These mechanisms are intended for network operators to
   perform more secured network management and troubleshooting tasks
   while using traceroute and ping tools.  The changes proposed in this
   document are backward compatible (with the existing traceroute and
   ping tools) and applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

   The mechanisms specified in this document apply to to the following
   traceroute and ping probe protocols: UDP [RFC0768], TCP [RFC0793],
   and ICMP/ICMPv6 [RFC0792] [RFC4443].  This mechanism also applies to
   the ICMP/ICMPv6 echo reply messages [RFC0792].

   This document defines an extension for traceroute and ping probe
   messages to optionally include authentication signature object.  The
   intermediate and destination nodes can authenticate the sender of the
   traceroute or ping packet before providing the requested information
   in the ICMP response.  This document also defines an optional
   Information-Request Object for the traceroute/ping extension.  This
   Object specifies the types of information the sender expects to be
   included in the traceroute/ping response (i.e., in the ICMP message
   elicited by the traceroute/ping packet and generated by the
   intermediate or destination node or nodes).

   Other applications can define their own Trace-Ping objects using this
   extension.


3.  Motivation

   The current traceroute or ping has no defined mechanism to include
   application data on the sender side, or to include application data
   in the ICMP echo reply on the receiver side.  Although the [RFC4884]
   has defined the multi-part message extension in ICMP, it is applied
   only to the ICMP type 3, 11 and 12 for traceroute reply messages.

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Ping Extension          February 2012


   Those mechanisms are not applied to traceroute probe messages or ICMP
   echo request/reply messages.

   For security concerns of traceroute or ping packets, one may employ a
   rudimentary control mechanism to limit the trusted senders by
   defining on every router the access control lists specifying source
   addresses of the traceroute and ping message, such mechanism is
   deemed configuration intensive, static, and error-prone.  Moreover,
   such mechanism would be susceptible to address spoofing.
   Additionally, such mechanism does not provide the sender with dynamic
   control of the different kind of extensions to be requested.

   The ICMP reply messages has been extended to support multi-part
   message inside ICMP [RFC4884] for some ICMP types.  Some of the
   applications [RFC5837] [RFC4950] [I-D.shen-icmp-routing-inst] are
   designed mainly for internal network troubleshooting by network
   operators.  Network providers may want to limit those applications
   only to trusted senders of traceroute/ping probes due to security or
   policy reasons by using this mechanism described in this document.

   Other applications, for example the TRILL-OAM [I-D.tissa-trill-oam]
   can use this scheme to extend their OAM application using ICMP echo
   request and reply for data center troubleshootings.


4.  Trace-Ping Message Extension

   This proposed extension is to define a Trace-Ping data structure that
   starts at a fixed location (i.e. the 64 octet) in the UDP/TCP/ICMP
   probe packet data field.

4.1.  Trace-Ping Extension Structure

   The Trace-Ping structure starts in UDP/TCP/ICMP data field location
   64th octet, see Section 4.2.  It MUST have exactly one Trace-Ping
   common header followed by zero or more Trace-Ping Objects.

4.1.1.  Trace-Ping Common Header

   The Common Header is a 8 octets structure has the following format:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields of the Common Header are defined as follows:

   Version: 4 bits.  It is defined as 1 in this document.

   Length:  12 bits.  The total length of the Trace-Ping data structure
            specifying number of 32-bit words (includes the common
            header and all the Objects).

   Checksum:  16 bits.  The one's complement of the one's complement sum
            of the Trace-Ping data structure, with the checksum field
            replaced by zero for the purpose of computing the checksum.

   Magic Number:  32 bits.  It is defined as Hex value of 0x54726163 in
            this document.  This is used mainly for structure
            identification of this extension version.

4.1.2.  Trace-Ping Object

   Trace-Ping Object have the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

   Length:  16 bits.  Length of object, measured in octets, including
            the object header and object payload.

   Class-Num:  8 bits.  Identifies ICMP Trace-Ping object class.

   C-Type:  8 bits.  Identifies ICMP Trace-Ping object sub-type.

   All the Trace-Ping Objects are optional.  This document defines two
   Trace-Ping Objects below.

4.1.2.1.  Trace-Ping Authentication Object

   This Object carries the HMAC authentication related information.  It
   verifies both the data integrity and the authenticity of the entire
   message.  This Object has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

     |                                                               |
     |                     Auth Data (Variable)                      |
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ...

   Length:  Variable, in octets.

   Class-Num:  IANA allocation from ICMP Trace-Ping extension registry.

   C-Type:  1

   Auth Type:  16 bits.  The following values are proposed:

            *  Type=0 signifies no authentication.

            *  Type=1 signifies simple password based authentication.

            *  Type=2 signifies Cryptographic authentication.

            Please note that the above type values are in line with IANA
            allocated values for other protocols (e.g., OSPF).

   Key ID:  8 bits.  This allows multiple secret keys to be active
            simultaneously.  Using Key IDs makes the key rollover
            convenient.  Each secret key must be associated with the
            hash algorithm.  This may be done through provisioning on
            each node.

   Auth Data Len:  8 bits.  This specifies the length of the
            authentication data (and allows for the support of current
            and future authentication schemes).

   Auth Data:  Variable length.  This field carries the result (e.g.,
            HMAC code) of the HMAC algorithm applied over the entire
            traceroute/ping IP/IPv6 packet.  When the Auth data is
            calculated, the shared key is stored in this field, and the
            checksum fields in the IP header, UDP/TCP/ICMP header and
            Trace-Ping common header are set to zero.  The result of the
            algorithm is placed in the Auth Key field.  The following
            lists algorithms that could be commonly supported:

            *  HMAC-MD5

            *  HMAC-SHA1

            *  HMAC-SHA2 variants (e.g., 224, 256, 384, 512, etc.)

            At least HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA1 algorithms should be
            supported on all the nodes compliant with this
            specification.

4.1.2.2.  Trace-Ping Information-Request Object

   This Information-Request Object is defined using a bitmap of 32-bits
   field to represent an array of attributes.  The attribute information
   can be referenced in [RFC4950] [RFC5837]
   [I-D.shen-icmp-routing-inst].  If detailed information needs to be
   specified, new objects will have to be defined and it is outside the
   scope of this document.

   The Information-Request Object has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Ping Extension          February 2012


   Info-Req:  32 bits.  This bitflag field lists the request items the
            probe sender is interested.  The bit number ranges from the
            right most bit to the left most bit.  Currently defined as
            the following:

              Bit Number Information Item
                   0     MPLS label related attributes
                   1     Interface related attributes
                   2     IP/IPv6 address related attributes
                   3     Routing Instance related attributes
                   4     Nexthop(s) related attributes

4.2.  Trace-Ping Extension Offset

   The Trace-Ping Extension data structure starts at the fixed location
   of 64th octet inside UDP, TCP and ICMP data field.  The first 64
   octets data is not defined and can be used by the probe packet
   sender.


5.  Trace-Ping Port Number

   The Trace-Ping Port SHOULD be used for the UDP destination port, TCP
   destination port or the ICMP echo request Identifier field with this
   Trace-Ping extension.  If the implementation uses the port field for
   the packet sequence purposes, then the sequence information can be
   written in the private space in the first 64 octets of the data field
   in probe packets.

   When the UDP or TCP, either in Traceroute or Ping operation, packet
   reaches the destination, the host or router will return the ICMP
   DESTINATION UNREACHABLE message back to the sender.


6.  Scaling Considerations on Internet

   Although this extension allows new features easily being developed on
   top of the existing and popular Traceroute and Ping applications, it
   does create challenges on the Internet as how to distinguish the
   regular Traceroute and Ping packets from the new feature usages
   without incurring rather substantial resource overhead.  Steps need
   to be taken on both implementation and operational sides.

6.1.  Implementation and Operation Considerations

   Implementation of this extension SHOULD use configuration knobs to
   enable the new features on the device and leave the standard behavior
   of Traceroute and Ping treatment if the explicit configuration for



Shen, et al.             Expires August 30, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Ping Extension          February 2012


   this extension is not present.

   The probe sender SHOULD use the Trace-Ping Port in their UDP and TCP
   Traceroute or Ping packets when using this extension; and the probe
   sender SHOULD use the Trace-Ping Port in the Identifier of ICMP echo
   request packet.  This will allow the receiver side to easily identify
   the new features the network wants to support.

   Implementation SHOULD allow filters or access-list mechanism to be
   attached to this extension configurations.  For example, the checking
   or verifying the existence of this extension in the probe packets is
   only performed when the probe packet is sourced from certain network
   prefix range.  Different features using this extension MAY have
   different filters or access-lists.

   Although this extension allows Traceroute and Ping packets to be
   rate-limited just as the regular packets, the implementation SHOULD
   apply special rate-limit if the feature is configured.  This special
   rate-limit SHOULD be configurable due to the nature of the features,
   the device resource consumption of the features and the handling of
   DoS attacks.  The default special rate-limit SHOULD not exceeds the
   rate-limit of regular Traceroute and Ping operations on the device.

   On the prober packet or the sender side, implementation SHOULD allow
   specifying the requested information, thus only a subset of the
   regular objects need to be included in the replying ICMP packets when
   the receiver is configured to support this feature.


7.  Security Considerations

   This extension enhances the security of traceroute and ping operation
   in a backwards-compatible fashion.  The mechanism allows the receiver
   to verify the sender of the traceroute/ping packet such that certain
   sensitive application, interface and network related information can
   be supplied in the internal network or across trusted networks.

   The use of Cryptographic authentication (i.e., an Auth Type value of
   2) allows for a strong authentication mechanism since the keys cannot
   be discerned by intercepting the packets.  The proposed Keyed
   authentication does not prevent replay attacks.  However, in the case
   of replay attacks, since the packet source IP/IPv6 address of the
   traceroute/ping probe can not be changed, there is no easy way for
   the attacker to retrieve the ICMP messages.

   A router needs to protect against purposefully-bogus Traceroute
   packets with extensions that fail the authentication, as a high rate
   of messages can require significant processing time.  [RFC1812]

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Ping Extension          February 2012


   specifies how rate-limiting is applied to the generation of ICMP
   messages, and this rate-limiting deters the threat when applied
   before checking the Authentication.  Additionally, when using
   Cryptographic authentication, the HMAC includes the source IP
   address, which means the HMAC will not validate if the traceroute/
   ping packet is sent over a NAT.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a well-known port number, Trace-Ping
   Port, for the UDP and TCP of this Trace-Ping extensions.

   The IANA is also requested to allocate the same Trace-Ping Port to be
   used for the Identifier in the ICMP Echo Request with this Trace-Ping
   extensions.

   The Trace-Ping Extension contains Trace-Ping Objects.  IANA is
   requested to assign a new Class-Num for the Trace-Ping extension, and
   a sub-registry under Trace-Ping extension to include c-types.  This
   document has defined c-type 1 and 2 for authentication and
   information-request objects. c-types 3-0xF6 are allocated through
   Expert Review [RFC5226].  C-types 0xF7 to 0xFF are reserved for
   private use.

   IANA should also establish a registry for Trace-Ping Info-Request
   Bits under the information-request sub-registry.  This document
   defines bits 0 - 5 in Section 4.1.2.2.  Bits 6-29 are allocated
   through Expert Review.  Bits 30 - 31 are reserved for private use.
