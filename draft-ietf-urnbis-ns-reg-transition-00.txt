     Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Registration Transition
                 draft-ietf-urnbis-ns-reg-transition-00

Abstract

   The original registration procedure for formal Uniform Resource Name
   (URN) namespaces required IETF Consensus.  That requirement
   discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems
   that could occur as a result.  The requirements have now been changed
   in [[RFC 3406bis]] to adopt a different model.  This document
   specifies IANA instructions to adapt selected existing registrations
   to the new model.  It also obsoletes some previous RFCs to eliminate
   any ambiguity about the status of new templates and updated
   registrations.

1.  Introduction

   [[Note in draft: This document has been written in RFC form, i.e.,
   assuming that it and 3406bis have been approved.  That style of
   writing assumes that RFC 3406 and the rules it specified are already
   obsolete.  It may be a bit awkward while the I-D is being evaluated
   by the WG and the IETF, but lowers the risk for errors or other
   surprises during the RFC editing process.]]

   As a part of the initial development of the URN system back in the
   late 1990s, the IETF URN working group agreed that it was important
   to demonstrate that the URN syntax can accommodate existing
   identifier systems.  RFC 2288 [RFC2288] investigated the feasibility
   of using three identifiers (ISBN, ISSN and SICI) as URNs, with
   positive results; however, it did not formally register corresponding
   URN namespaces.  This was in part due to the still evolving process
   to formalize criteria for namespace definition documents and
   registration, consolidated later in the IETF, first into RFC 2611
   [RFC2611] and then into RFC 3406 [RFC3406].

   URN Namespaces have subsequently been registered for NBN (National
   Bibliography Number), ISBN (International Standard Book Number), and
   ISSN (International Serial Standard Number) in RFCs 3188 [RFC3188],
   3187 [RFC3187], 3044 [RFC3044] respectively.

   The original registration procedure for Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   namespaces [RFC3406] required IETF Consensus for formal ones.  That

   requirement discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for
   problems that could occur as a result.  Those potential problems
   included the possibility of the same name being used to identify
   different namespaces with different rules.  The requirements have now
   been changed [RFC3406bis] to adopt a different model that focuses
   more on attempting to get all namespaces that follow the syntax of
   formal ones registered, with as much information collected as a
   possible consistent with that goal.  This document specifies IANA
   instructions to adapt selected existing registrations to the new
   model and obsoletes the RFCs that specify the namespaces for
   International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs) [RFC3044],
   International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) [RFC3187] to eliminate
   any ambiguity about the status of new templates and updated
   registrations.

   An updated version of the specification for the namespace for
   National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs) [RFC3188] will be issued
   separately.  NBN is not a formal standard and RFC 3188 is the only
   formal document which specifies its scope.  The intention is to
   modernize the existing namespace registration so that it specifies
   the identifier and provides examples of its use, while the actual
   namespace registration will be done according to the new practice.

2.  Obsoleting Older Registration RFCs

   The existing RFCs that describe URN namespaces for ISSNs (RFC 3044)
   and ISBNs (RFC 3187) should be identified as "Historic" immediately
   after this document is approved and the new registration templates
   for those namespaces are submitted and incorporated into the URN
   Namespace registry by IANA.

   [[Note in draft: The more information that can be supplied in the
   template or references from it, the better.  But, if there is
   information in the now-expired Internet-Drafts (draft-ietf-urnbis-
   rfc3187bis-isbn-urn, draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3044bis-issn-urn) that
   should be captured somewhere and that doesn't fit naturally in the
   template, the discussion below is probably a reasonable place to put
   it.]]

   Those updated templates reflect not only new formats but substantive
   changes to the definitions of the namespaces, as described in the
   following subsections.

Internet-Draft         URN Registration Transition           August 2013


2.1.  ISBN URN Changes

   The revised ISBN namespace reflects the updated version of the ISO
   Standard for ISBNs, ISO 2108:2005 [ISO-ISBN-b] and allows for the use
   of both the ten character numbers described in RFC 3187 and the
   earlier ISO 2108:1992 [ISO-ISBN-a] (known as ISBN-10) and the
   expanded ones of the revised standard (known as ISBN-13).

2.2.  ISSN URN Changes

   The ISSN namespace is also updated to reflect changes between the
   ISSN Standard when RFC 3044 was written and the newest, 2007 version
   [ISO-ISSN].

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the registry entries for URN ISSNs,
   ISBNs, and NRNs to reflect the new, RFC 3406bis-complaint templates
   as soon as they are available and to no longer reference the now-
   historic RFCs.  Other registrations and templates conforming to the
   newer rules may be substituted for the older ones when they are
   available.  However, neither this document nor RFC 3406bis
   invalidates existing registrations other than those listed above, so
   IANA needs to be prepared to maintain a registry whose contents
   reflect both old and new templates.

4.  Security Considerations

   While particular URN namespaces and their registrations might
   conceivably have security implications, this specification merely
   specifies a transition in a registration procedure and does not have
   such implications.  The security implications associated with
   particular namespaces are expected to be listed in registration
   templates as specified in RFC 3406bis.

5.  Acknowledgements

   This document draws heavily on discussions in the IETF URNbis Working
   Group in the second and third quarters of 2013, particularly during
   IETF 87 in August 2013, and on informal discussions during the
   plenary meeting of ISO TC 46 in June 2013.  The efforts of those who
   participated in those discussions are greatly appreciated.  It also
   draws on internet-drafts that were developed to update the older
   registrations before that approach was replaced by the new extended
   template model.  Those drafts were prepared by Pierre Godefroy, Juha
   Hakala, Alfred Hoenes, and Maarit Huttunen.
