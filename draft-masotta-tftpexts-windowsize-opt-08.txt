                         TFTP Windowsize Option

draft-masotta-tftpexts-windowsize-opt-08.txt

Abstract

   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file
   transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a
   remote host. One of its primary uses is the early stages of nodes 
   booting from a Local Area Network. TFTP has been always used because
   it is very simple to implement. However, the choice of a lock-step
   schema is not the most efficient for use on a LAN.

   This document describes a TFTP option which allows the client and
   server to negotiate a windowsize of consecutive blocks to send 
   as an alternative for replacing the single block lock-step schema. 
   The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is described in [2].

Internet Draft           TFTP Windowsize Option              Nov 2013

Introduction

   While virtually unused for internet transfers today, TFTP is still
   massively used in network boot/installation scenarios (EFI included).
   The protocol inherently low transfer rate has been so far partially
   mitigated by the use of the blocksize negotiated extension [3]. This
   way the original 512 byte blocks are in practice replaced on Ethernet
   environments by blocks no larger than 1468 Bytes to avoid IP block
   fragmentation. This strategy results insufficient when transferring
   big files i.e. the initial ramdisk of Linux distributions or the PE
   images used in network installations by Microsoft WDS/MDT/SCCM.
   Considering TFTP looks today far from extinction this draft formally 
   presents a negotiated natural extension that produces TFTP transfer 
   rates comparable to the ones achieved today by modern file transfer 
   protocols.

Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [5]
   and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

Windowsize Option Specification

   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request packet is modified to include
   the windowsize option as follows.  Note that all fields except "opc"
   are NULL-terminated.

   +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+-----~~-----+---+---~~---+---+
   |  opc  |filename| 0 |  mode  | 0 | windowsize | 0 | #blocks| 0 |
   +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+-----~~-----+---+---~~---+---+

      opc
         The opcode field contains either a 1, for Read Requests, or 2,
         for Write Requests, as defined in [1].

      filename
         The name of the file to be read or written, as defined in [1].

      mode
         The mode of the file transfer: "netascii", "octet", or "mail",
         as defined in [1].

      windowsize
         The Windowsize option, "windowsize" (case in-sensitive).

      #blocks
         The number of blocks in a window, specified in ASCII.  Valid
         values range between "1" and "65535" blocks, inclusive. The
         windowsize refers to the number of consecutives blocks 
         transmited before stop and wait for the reception of the 
         acknowledgment of the last block transmited.

Internet Draft           TFTP Windowsize Option             Nov 2013

   For example:

     +-------+--------+---+-------+---+------------+---+------+---+
     |   1   | foobar | 0 | octet | 0 | windowsize | 0 |  16  | 0 |
     +-------+--------+---+-------+---+------------+---+------+---+


   is a Read Request, for the file named "foobar", in octet transfer
   mode, with a window-size of 16 blocks (as option blocksize is not 
   negotiated in this case, the 512 Bytes per block default applies).

   If the server is willing to accept the windowsize option, it sends 
   an Option Acknowledgment (OACK) to the client.  The specified value
   must be less than or equal to the value specified by the client. 
   The client must then either use the size specified in the OACK, or 
   send an ERROR packet, with error code 8, to terminate the transfer.

   The rules for determining the final packet are unchanged from [1]
   and [3].
   The reception of a data window with a number of blocks less than
   the negotiated windowsize is the final window. If the windowsize
   is greater than the amount of data to be transferred, the first
   window is the final window.

Congestion control

   From a congestion control standpoint while the number of blocks in 
   a window does not represent a threat, the rate at which TFTP UDP 
   datagrams are sent SHOULD follow the congestion control guidelines
   in Section 3.1 of RFC 5405 [4].

Proof of Concept

   Performance tests were run on the prototype implementation using a
   variety of windowsizes and a fixed blocksize of 1456 bytes.  The 
   tests were run on a lightly loaded Gigabit Ethernet, between two
   Toshiba Tecra Core 2 Duo 2.2 Ghz, in "octet" mode, transfering a
   180 MByte file.

   The comparison of transfer times (without a gateway) between the
   standard lock-step schema and the negotiated windowsizes are:

              1      -0%
              2     -49%
              4     -70%
              8     -79%
             16     -84%
             32     -85%
             64     -86%

                windowsize (in blocks of 1456 bytes)


   As it was expected, the transfer time decreases with the use of a
   windowed schema. The reason for the reduction in time is the 
   reduction in the number of the required synchronous acknowledgements
   exchanged.

   Comparatively the same 180 MB transfer performed over an SMB/CIFS 
   mapped drive on the same scenario took 23 seconds.

Security Considerations

   The basic TFTP protocol does not have an explicit security mechanism.
   However it also does not have list, rename, delete, nor overwrite
   capabilities either. This document does not add any security to TFTP
   nor the specified extension adds any additional security risk either.

IANA Considerations 
   This document has no actions for IANA.

Error Handling
   In case of an error the last ACK received sets the beginning of the
   next windowsize window to send.
