          IPv6 Stateless Fragmentation Identification Options
                   draft-andrews-6man-fragopt-01.txt

Abstract

   Fragmented IPv6 packets are often dropped because there is no way to
   identify whether a fragment matches a otherwise permitted packet as
   the L4 header information is not available on all the fragments.

   The document defines hop-by-hop options that can be used to supply
   the missing information in non initial fragments.

1.  Introduction

   Fragmented IPv6 packets are often dropped because there is no way to
   identify whether a fragment matches a otherwise permitted packet as
   the L4 header information is not available on all the fragments.

   The document defines hop-by-hop options that can be used to supply
   the missing information in non initial fragments.

   The information required differs depending upon the L4 packet.  For
   TCP and UDP the source and destination ports are needed.  For ICMP
   the type of ICMP packet is needed.

   These options are expected to be used by middle boxes (firewalls and
   load balancers) and end nodes.


2.  TCP and UDP Fragments

   For TCP and UDP a skippable hop-by-hop option [RFC2460] (for
   backwards compatibility) containing the source and destination ports
   from the TCP and UDP headers is needed.  To permit the use of NATs,
   however undesired, the option contents are marked changeable enroute.
   The option code has mnemonic PORTS and value (TBD) and is added to
   all fragments of UDP and TCP packets when they are fragmented.  By
   adding the option to all fragments you reduce the amount of
   fragmentation reassembly failures that would result if you only added
   the option to non-initial fragments and were dropping non-initial
   fragments without this option.

   NAT should update the port fields to match those in the TCP and UDP
   headers if it updates those fields as part of the NAT processing.

3.  ICMPv6 Fragments

   To identify the type of ICMPv6 packet a fragment is part of the type
   and code values need to be copied from the ICMPv6 header.  As with
   the TCP and UDP case, a skippable hop-by-hop option is required.
   ICMPv6 type and code points are not changed by NAT so a immutable

   hop-by-hop option could be used.

   In most cases a ICMPv6 error message won't need to be fragmented as
   the maximum size of a ICMPv6

6.  Open Questions

   Should this be a single hop-by-hop option or multiple hop-by-hop
   options?

   If a single hop-by-hop option, should it include the next header
   field of the fragment header or should this be implicit?


7.  IANA Considerations

   To be completed.


8.  Security Considerations

   The use of these options will expose nodes to more fragmentation
   based attacks and potentially more traffic which will ultimately be
   dropped if a attacker can guess which option values will be
   permitted.

   With the exception of the fragmentation based attacks, permitting
   fragments with these options is no worse that permitting multiple un-
   fragmented packets based in the same parameters.

   When reassembling a packet all fragments of a packet should have a
   identical fragment identification option and it should be on all
   fragment or on none of the fragments.

   For TCP and UDP the ports values may or may not match up with those
   of the un-fragmented packet when the packet has been through a NAT.
   When a packet has passed through multiple NAT boxes that are unaware
   of this option both the source and destination ports may have been
   changed so the ports may appear to be completely unrelated.  The
   source port is changed by a client NAT and the destination port is
   changed by a NAT acting a load balancer.
