Internet-Draft            Reputation Media Type             October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a media type for use when answering a reputation
   query using the "long form" query defined in RFCxxxx+4, which uses
   [HTTP].  It is part of a series defining the overall reputation
   query/response structure as well as the concept of reputation
   "vocabularies" for particular applications.

   Also included is the specification for an IANA registry to contain
   definitions and symbolic names for known reputation vocabularies.


2.  Document Series

   This memo represents the media type registration, part of a series of
   documents that define the overall service and introduce the initial
   exemplary applications.  The series is as follows:

   1.  RFCxxxx: A Model for Reputation Interchange

   2.  RFCxxxx+1: A Media Type for Reputation Information (this memo)

   3.  RFCxxxx+2: Using UDP for Reputation Interchange

   4.  RFCxxxx+3: Using the DNS for Reputation Interchange

   5.  RFCxxxx+4: Using HTTP/XML for Reputation Interchange

   6.  RFCxxxx+5: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Identity Reputation

   7.  RFCxxxx+6: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Property Reputation


3.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

3.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.2.  Other Definitions

   Other terms of importance in this memo are defined in RFCxxxx, the
   base memo in this document series.

4.  Description

   A new media type, "application/reputon", is defined for the
   representation of reputational data.  This media type has two
   optional parameters: "app", which conveys the specific application of
   reputation data in use, and usually extends the set of data values
   that MAY be included in the media object itself; and "format", which
   specifies the format with which the content are relayed.

   The default for "format" is "text", which is defined here.  Reputons
   bearing unrecognized format values MUST be ignored.

   The body of the media type consists of [MAIL]-style attribute/value
   pairs, six of which are standard for all apps:

   RATER:  The identity of the entity providing the reputation
      information, generally expressed as a DNS domain name.

   RATER-AUTHENTICITY:  The level of confidence in that identity being
      genuine, expressed as a floating-point number between 0 and 1
      inclusive.

   ASSERTION:  A keyword indicating the specific assertion or claim
      being rated.  In the absence of an "app" parameter, the reputon
      can only indicate generic goodness, with the default assertion
      "IS-GOOD," but each application is expected to define additional
      types of ASSERTION.

   RATED:  The identity of the entity being rated.

   RATING:  The overall rating score for that entity, expressed as a
      floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.  See
      Section 5 for discussion.

   SAMPLE-SIZE:  The number of data points used to compute that score,
      possibly an approximation.  Expressed as an unsigned 64-bit
      integer.

   A particular application that registers itself with IANA MAY also
   define extension attribute/value pairs beyond the six mandatory ones.

   Thus, the following example:

Internet-Draft            Reputation Media Type             October 2011


         Content-type: application/reputon

         RATER: RatingsRUs.example.com
         RATER-AUTHENTICITY: 1.0
         ASSERTION: IS-GOOD
         RATED: Alex Rodriguez
         RATING: 0.99
         SAMPLE-SIZE: 50000

   ...indicates that we are absolutely sure (1.0) that the entity
   "RatingsRUs.example.com" consolidated 50000 data points (perhaps from
   everyone in Yankee Stadium) and concluded that Alex Rodriguez is very
   very good (0.99) at something.  It doesn't tell us what he's good at,
   and while it might be playing baseball, it could just as well be
   paying his taxes on time.

   A more sophisticated usage would define a baseball application with a
   vocabulary of specific assertions, so that this example:

         Content-type: application/reputon; app="baseball"

         RATER: baseball-reference.example.com
         RATER-AUTHENTICITY: 1.0
         ASSERTION: HITS-FOR-POWER
         RATED: Alex Rodriguez
         RATING: 0.99
         SAMPLE-SIZE: 50000

   ...would indicate that 50000 fans polled by the entity baseball-
   reference.example.com rate A-Rod very highly in hitting for power,
   whereas this example:

         Content-type: application/reputon; app="baseball"

         RATER: baseball-reference.example.com
         RATER-AUTHENTICITY: 1.0
         ASSERTION: CLUTCH-HITTER
         RATED: Alex Rodriguez
         RATING: 0.4
         SAMPLE-SIZE: 50000

   ...would indicate that a similar poll indicated a somewhat weaker
   consensus that A-Rod tends to choke in critical baseball situations.

   In practice, most usage of reputons is expected to make use of the
   "app" parameter to target an application-specific set of assertions.

4.1.  Formal Definition

   More formally, using [ABNF], the content of the application/reputon
   MIME object MUST conform to the following syntax:

   reputon := rater rater-auth assertion *extension
              rated rating sampsize

   rater := "RATER:"
            *WSP (atom / quoted-string) [CFWS] CRLF

   rater-auth := "RATER-AUTHENTICITY:"
                 *WSP 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF
              ; must be a number between -1 and 1 inclusive

   assertion := "ASSERTION:"
                *WSP dot-atom-text [CFWS] CRLF

   extension := dot-atom-text %x3A *WSP dot-atom-text [CFWS] CRLF
             ; must be registered with IANA within a reputation
             ; vocabulary registration

   rated := "RATED:"
            *WSP (atom / quoted-string) [CFWS] CRLF

   rating := "RATING:"
             *WSP 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF
          ; must be a number between 0 and 1 inclusive

   sampsize := "SAMPLE-SIZE":
               *WSP 1*DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF
            ; must be an unsigned 64-bit integer

   "atom", "quoted-string" and "dot-atom-text" are imported from [MAIL].


5.  Scores

   The score presented as the value in the RATING parameter appears as a
   floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.  The intent is
   that the definition of an assertion within an application will
   declare what the anchor values 0.0 and 1.0 specifically mean.
   Generally speaking, 1.0 implies full agreement with the assertion,
   while 0.0 indicates no support for the assertion.

   The definition will also specify the type of scale in use when
   generating scores, to which all reputation service providers for that
   application space must adhere.  This will allow a client to change

   which reputation service provider is being queried for a given
   without having to learn through some out-of-band method what the new
   provider's values mean.  For example, a registration might state that
   ratings are linear, which would mean a score of "x" is twice as
   strong as a value of "x/2".


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo presents two actions for IANA, namely the creation of the
   new media type "application/reputon" and the creation of a registry
   for reputation application types.  Another memo in this series
   creates an initial registry entry for the latter.

6.1.  application/reputon Media Type Registration

   This section provides the media type registration application from
   [MIME-REG] for processing by IANA:

   To:  ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject:  Registration of media type application/reputon

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  reputon

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:

      app:  Names the reputation application in use within the reputon,
         which defines the valid assertions and any extensions that may
         also be valid (i.e., the vocabulary) for that application.
         These MUST be registered with IANA.

      format:  Describes the format of the content of the MIME object.
         The default is "text" which is defined in this memo.

   Encoding considerations:  "7bit" encoding is sufficient and MUST be
      used to maintain readability when viewed by non-MIME mail readers.

   Security considerations:  See Section 7 of [this document].

   Interoperability considerations:  Implementers MUST ignore any "app"
      values, attribute/value pairs, or vocabulary items they do not
      support.

   Published specification:  [this document]

   Applications that use this media type:  Any application that wishes
      to query a service that provides reputation data using the "long
      form" defined in RFCxxxx.  The example application is one that
      provides reputation expressions about DNS domain names found in
      email messages.

   Additional information:  The value of the "app" parameter MUST also
      be registered with IANA.

   Person and email address to contact for further information:

         Murray S. Kucherawy

   Change controller:  IESG

6.2.  Reputation Applications Registry

   IANA is requested to create the "Reputation Applications" registry.
   This registry will contain names of applications used with the
   application/reputon media type, as defined by this memo.

   New registrations or updates MUST be published in accordance with the
   "Specification Required" guidelines as described in
   [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS].

   New registrations and updates MUST contain the following information:

   1.  Name of the application being registered or updated

   2.  Short description of the application (i.e., the class of entity
       about which it reports reputation data)

   3.  The document in which the application is defined

   4.  New or updated status, which MUST be one of:

Internet-Draft            Reputation Media Type             October 2011


       current:  The application is in current use

       deprecated:  The application is in current use but its use is
          discouraged

       historic:  The application is no longer in current use

   5.  An optional table of query parameters that are specific to this
       application; each table entry must include:

       Name:  Name of the query parameter

       Status:  (as above)

       Description:  A short description of the purpose of this
          parameter

       Syntax:  A reference to a description of valid syntax for the
          parameter's value

       Required:  "yes" if the parameter is mandatory, "no" otherwise

   A document creating a reputation application MUST include:

   1.  A list of one or more assertions registered within this
       application; each table entry must include:

       Name:  Name of the assertion

       Description:  A short description of the assertion, with specific
          meanings for values of 0.0 and 1.0

       Scale:  A short description of the scale used in computing the
          value (see Section 5 of this memo)


7.  Security Considerations

   This memo describes security considerations introduced by the media
   type defined here.

7.1.  General

   This memo is part of a series introducing a reputation query and
   response system (see Section 2).  The Security Considerations
   sections of the other memos should also be consulted.

   As this message structure is designed for use with the "long form" of
