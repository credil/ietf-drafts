Internet-Draft              ARF Source Ports                  March 2012


1.  Introduction

   [ARF] defined the Abuse Reporting Format, a new header message format
   for use in reporting incidents of email abuse.  It was extended by
   [I-D.IETF-MARF-AUTHFAILURE-REPORT] to enable reporting of email
   authentication failures.  Although those specifications gave the
   capability to include the source IP address in the report, the source
   port was not included.  As explained in [LOG], the deployment of IP
   sharing techniques means it can now be essential to include source
   port values in reports if unambiguous identification of the origin of
   abuse is to be achieved.

   Accordingly, this memo registers an ARF reporting field to contain
   this information and provides guidance for its use.

2.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.  Source-Port Field Definition

   A new ARF reporting field called "Source-Port" is defined.  When
   present in a report, it MUST contain the TCP or UDP source port
   matching the "Source-IP" field in the same report, thereby describing
   completely the origin of the abuse incident.

   Per, [ABNF], the formal syntax is:

     source-port = "Source-Port:" [CFWS] 1*DIGIT [CFWS] CRLF

   "CFWS" is imported from [MAIL].

   When any report is generated that includes the "Source-IP" reporting
   field, this field SHOULD also be present.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the Feedback Report
   Header Fields registry:

   Field Name:  Source-Port

   Description:  TCP or UDP source port from which the reported
      connection originated
