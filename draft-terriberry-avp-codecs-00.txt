          Update to Recommended Codecs for the AVP RTP Profile
                     draft-terriberry-avp-codecs-00

Abstract

   [RFC3551] defines the AVP RTP profile, which is the basis for many
   other profiles, such as SAVP [RFC3711], AVPF [RFC4585], and SAVPF
   [RFC5124].  This document updates [RFC3551] (and by extension, the
   profiles that build upon it) to reflect changes in audio codec usage
   since the document was originally published.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC3551] says that audio applications operating under the AVP
   profile SHOULD be able to send and receive PCMU and DVI4.  However,
   in practice, many RTP deployments do not support DVI4, and its
   utility is limited in the presence of much more modern codecs.  This
   document updates the recommended audio codec selection for the AVP
   profile to remove the SHOULD for DVI4.

3.  Updates to RFC 3551

   The text of [RFC3551] is hereby updated as set forth below.

3.1.  Updates to Section 6

   In the final paragraph of Section 6, replace, "payload types 0 (PCMU)
   and 5 (DVI4)," with "payload type 0 (PCMU)."  Also, add a final
   sentence to this paragraph that states, "Some environments may make
   support for PCMU mandatory."
