        Requirements for Extending BGP/MPLS VPNs to End-Systems
            draft-fang-l3vpn-end-system-requirements-02.txt


Abstract 

   The proven scalability and extensibility beyond the original design
   purposes of the BGP/MPLS IP VPNs (IP VPN) technology [RFC4364] has
   made it an attractive candidate for Data Center (DC)/Cloud
   virtualization. This document provides the requirements for extending
   IP VPN (in original or modified versions) into the end-systems/end-
   devices, such as a server in a DCs/Cloud. Physical separation of the
   control and the forwarding planes; virtualizing the network functions
   of the IP VPN network elements, such as a PE, are the key differences
   compared with the classic IP VPN solutions.

1  Introduction

   Enterprise networks are increasingly being consolidated and
   outsourced in an effort to improve the deployment time of services as
   well as reduce operational costs. This coincides with an increasing
   demand for compute, storage, and network resources from applications.
   Logical abstraction of these resources is needed to for improved
   scalability and cost efficiency. This is referred as server, storage,
   and network virtualization. It can be implemented in all layers of
   the computer systems or networks. The virtualized loads are executed
   or transferred over a common physical infrastructure. Compute nodes
   running guest operating systems are often executed as Virtual
   Machines (or VMs). Network virtualization is the next step after
   compute virtualization.  

   This document defines requirements for a network virtualization
   solution that provides BGP/MPLS IP VPN style connectivity to virtual
   resources on end-systems/end-device, such as a server, operating in a
   multi-tenant shared physical infrastructure. The requirements
   addresses the needs of virtual resources, applications reside on VMs,
   and focus on the appliances that require only IP connectivity. Non-IP
   communication is addressed by other documents and is not in scope of
   this document.

   The technical solutions to support these requirements are work in
   progress in IETF. [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-end-system],
   [I-D.fang-l3vpn-virtual-pe]. The solutions may referred as End-System
   solutions or virtual PE (vPE) solutions in different documents.

2. Application of MPLS/BGP VPNs to End-Systems

   MPLS/BGP VPN technology [RFC4364] have proven to be able to very
   scale to a large number of VPNs (tens of thousands) and customer
   routes (millions) while providing for aggregated management
   capability. In traditional WAN deployments of BGP IP VPNs a Customer
   Edge (CE) is a physical device, residing a customer's location,
   connected to a Provider Edge (PE), residing in a Service Provider's
   location. CE devices are logically part of a customer's VPN while PE
   routers are logically part of the SP's network. In a traditional
   MPLS/BGP VPN deployment, a CE device is a router and it is a routing
   peer of a PE to which it is attached via an attachment circuit.

   In addition, the forwarding function and control function of a
   Provider Edge (PE) device co-exist within a single physical router.

   MPLS/BGP VPN technology can be evolved and adapted to new virtualized
   environments by implementing the VPN edge functionality of the PE
   line-cards on the end-system hosts and thereby extending VPN service
   directly to end-systems.

2.1. End-System CE and PE Functions

   When end-system/end-device attaches to MPLS/BGP VPN, CE corresponds
   to a non-routing host that can reside in a VM or be an application
   residing on the end-system itself.

   As in traditional MPLS/BGP VPN deployments, it is undesirable for the
   end-system VPN forwarding knowledge to extend to the core transport
   network infrastructure. Hence, optimally, with regard to forwarding,
   the end-system should become both the CE and the PE simultaneously.

   The network virtualization solution should also support deployments
   where it is not possible or not desirable to co-locate the PE and CE
   functionality. In such deployments PE may be implemented on an
   external device with remote CE attachments. This external PE device
   should be as close as possible to the end-system where the CE
   resides. The external PE devices that attach to a particular VPN,
   need to know, for each attachment circuit leading to that VPN, the
   host address that is reachable over that attachment circuit. The end-
   system MPLS/BGP VPN solution must specify a method to convey this
   information from the end-system to the PE.

   The same network virtualization solution should support deployments

   with mixed, internal (co-located with CE) and external PE (i.e.,
   remote CE) implementations.

2.2. PE Control Plane Function

   It is a current practice to implement MPLS/BGP VPN PE forwarding and
   control functions in different processors of the same device and to
   use internal (proprietary) communication between those processors.
   Typically, the PE control functionality is implemented in one (or
   very few) components of a device and the PE forwarding functionality
   is implemented in multiple components of the same device (a.k.a.,
   "line cards").

   In end-system environment, a single end-system, effectively,
   corresponds to a line card in a traditional PE router. For scalable
   and cost effective deployment of end-system MPLS/BGP VPNs the PE
   forwarding function should be decoupled from PE control function such
   that the former can be implemented on multiple standalone devices.
   This separation of functionality will allow for implementing the end-
   system PE forwarding on multiple end-system devices, for example, in
   operating systems of application servers or network appliances.
   Moreover, the separation of PE forwarding and control plane functions
   allows for the PE control plane function to be itself virtualized and
   run as an application in end-system.

3. VPN Communication Requirements

3.1. Unicast IPv4 and IPv6

   A network virtualization solution should be able to provide IPv4 and
   IPv6 unicast connectivity between hosts in the same and different
   subnets without any assumptions regarding the underlying media layer.

3.2. Multicast/VPN Broadcast IPv4 and IPv6

   Furthermore, the multicast transmission, i.e., allowing IP
   applications to send packets to a group of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
   should be supported. The multicast service should also support a
   delivery of traffic to all endpoints of a given VPN even if those
   endpoints have not sent any control messages indicating the need to
   receive that traffic. In other words, the multicast service should be
   capable of delivering the IP broadcast traffic in a virtual topology.
   A solution for supporting VPN multicast and VPN broadcast must not
   require that the underlying transport network supports IP multicast
   transmission service.

3.3. IP Subnet Support

INTERNET DRAFT           <BGP/MPLS IP VPN DCI>        <October 18, 2013>


   In some deployments, Virtual Machines or applications are configured
   to belong to an IP subnet.  A network virtualization solution should
   support grouping of virtual resources into IP subnets regardless of
   whether the underlying implementation uses a multi-access network or
   not. While some applications may expect to find other peers in a
   particular user defined IP subnet, this does not imply the need to
   provide a layer 2 service that preserves MAC addresses. End-system
   network virtualization solution should be able to provide IP
   (unicast, multicast, VPN broadcast) connectivity between hosts in the
   same and different subnets without any assumptions regarding the
   underlying media layer.

4. Multi-Tenancy Requirements

   One of the main goals of network virtualization is to provide traffic
   and routing isolation between different virtual components that share
   a common physical infrastructure. Networks use various VPN
   technologies to isolate disjoint groups of virtual resources. Some
   use VLANs [IEEE.802-1Q] as a VPN technology, others use layer 3 based
   solutions, often with proprietary control planes. Service Providers
   are interested in interoperability and in openly documented protocols
   rather than in proprietary solutions. Further more, it is more
   favorable if the solution can provide Open Source codes in public
   forums, this will give the most flexibility and agility for SPs to
   create new services.

   A collection of virtual resources might provide external or internal
   services. Such collection may serve an external "customer" or
   internal "tenant" to whom a Service Provider provides service(s). In
   MPLS/BGP VPN terminology a collection of virtual resources dedicated
   to a process or application corresponds to a VPN.

   A network virtualization multi-tenancy solution should support the
   following:

    - Tenant or application isolation, in data plane and control plane,
      while sharing the same underlying physical network. Tenants should
      be able to independently select and deploy their choice of IP
      address space: public or private IPv4 and/or IPv6.

    - Multiple distinct VPNs per tenant. Tenant's inter-VPN traffic
      should be allowed to cross VPN boundaries, subject to access
      controls and/or routing policies.

    - Inter-VPN communication, subject to access policies. Typically
      VPNs that belong to different external tenants do not communicate
      with each other directly but they should be allowed to access
      shared services or shared network resources. It is often the case

INTERNET DRAFT           <BGP/MPLS IP VPN DCI>        <October 18, 2013>


      that SP infrastructure services are provided to multiple tenants,
      for example voice-over-IP gateway services or video-conferencing
      services for branch offices.

    - VM or application end-point should be able to directly access
      multiple VPNs without a need to traverse a gateway.

    - End-system network virtualization solution should support both,
      isolated VPNs as well as overlapping VPNs (often referred to as
      "extranets"). It should also support any-to-any and hub-and-spoke
      topologies.

5. Decoupling of Virtualized Networking from Physical   Infrastructure

   One of the main goals in designing a large scale transport network is
   to minimize the cost and complexity of its "fabric" by delegating the
   virtual resource communication processing to the network edge. It has
   been proven (in Internet and in large MPLS/BGP VPN deployments) that
   moving complexity to network edge while keeping network core simple
   has very good scaling properties.

   The transport network infrastructure should not maintain any
   information that pertains to the virtual resources in end-systems.
   Decoupling of virtualized networking from the physical infrastructure
   has the following advantages: 1) provides better scalability; 2)
   simplifies the design and operation; 3) reduces network cost.

   Decoupling of virtualized networking from underlying physical network
   consists in the following:

    - Separation between the virtualized segments (i.e., interface
      associated with virtual resources) and the physical network (i.e.,
      physical interfaces associated with network infrastructure).

    - Separation of the virtual network IP address space from the
      physical infrastructure network IP address space. In the case of a
      transport other than IP, for example MPLS or Ethernet, the
      infrastructure address refers to the Subnetwork Point of
      Attachment (SNPA) address in a given multi-access network.

    - The physical infrastructure addresses should be routable (or
      switchable) in the underlying transport network, while the virtual
      network addresses should be routable only in the virtual network.

    - The virtual network control plane should be decoupled from the
      underlying transport network.

6. Decoupling of Layer 3 Virtualization from Layer 2 Topology

INTERNET DRAFT           <BGP/MPLS IP VPN DCI>        <October 18, 2013>


   The layer 3 approach to network virtualization dictates that the
   virtualized communication should be routed, not bridged. The layer 3
   virtualization solution should be decoupled from the layer 2
   topology. Thus, there should be no dependency on VLANs and layer 2
   broadcast.

   In solutions that depend on layer 2 broadcast domains, host-to-host
   communication is established based on flooding and data plane MAC
   learning. Layer 2 MAC information has to be maintained on every
   switch where a given VLAN is present. Even if some solutions are able
   to minimize data plane MAC learning and/or unicast flooding, they
   still rely on MAC learning at the network edge and on maintaining the
   MAC addresses on every switch where the layer 2 VPN is present.

   The MAC addresses known to guest OS in end-system are not relevant to
   IP services and introduce unnecessary overhead. Hence, the MAC
   addresses associated with virtual resources should not be used in the
   virtual layer 3 networks. Rather, only what is significant to IP
   communication, namely the IP addresses of the virtual machines and
   application endpoints should be maintained by the virtual networks.

7. Requirements for Encapsulation of Virtual Payloads

   In order to scale the transport networks, the virtual network
   payloads must be encapsulated with headers that are routable (or
   switchable) in the physical network infrastructure. The IP addresses
   of the virtual resources are not to be advertized within the physical
   infrastructure address space.

   The encapsulation (and de-capsulation) function should be implemented
   on a device as close to virtualized resources as possible. Since the
   hypervisors in the end-systems are the devices at the network edge
   they are the most optimal location for the encap/decap functionality.

   The network virtualization solution should also support deployments
   where it is not possible or not desirable to implement the virtual
   payload encapsulation in the hypervisor/Host OS. In such deployments
   encap/decap functionality may be implemented in an external device.
   The external device implementing encap/decap functionality should be
   a close as possible to the end-system itself. The same network
   virtualization solution should support deployments with both,
   internal (in a hypervisor) and external(outside of a hypervisor)
   encap/decap devices.

   Whenever the virtual forwarding functionality is implemented in an
   external device, the virtual service itself must be delivered to an
   end-system such that switching elements connecting the end-system to
   the encap/decap device are not aware of the virtual topology.

INTERNET DRAFT           <BGP/MPLS IP VPN DCI>        <October 18, 2013>


7.1. Encapsulation Methods

   MPLS/VPN technology based on [RFC4364] specifies that different
   encapsulation methods could be for connecting PE routers, namely
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs), IP tunneling, and GRE tunneling.

   If LSPs are used in the transport network they could be signaled with
   LDP, in which case host (/32) routes to all PE routers must be
   propagated throughout the network, or with RSVP-TE, in which case a
   full mesh of RSVP-TE tunnels is required.

   If the transport network is only IP-capable then MPLS in IP or MPLS
   in GRE [RFC4023] encapsulation could be used. Due to route
   aggregation property of IP protocols, with IP/GRE encapsulation the
   PE host routes do not have to be present in the transport network.

   Multi-access technologies, especially Ethernet, may also need to be
   supported as transport networks, for example, 802.1ah.

7.2. Routing of Virtual Payloads

   A device implementing the encap/decap functionality acts as the
   first-hop router in the virtual topology.

   In a layer 3 end-system virtual network, IP packets should reach the
   first-hop router in one IP-hop, regardless of whether the first-hop
   router is an end-system itself (i.e., a hypervisor/Host OS) or it is
   an external (to end-system) device. The first-hop router should
   always perform an IP lookup on every packet it receives from a
   virtual machine or an application. The first-hop router should
   encapsulate the packets and route them towards the destination end-
   system.

8. Optimal Forwarding of Traffic

   The network virtualization solutions that optimize for the maximum
   utilization of compute and storage resources require that those
   resources may be located anywhere in the network. The physical and
   logical spreading of appliances and workloads implies a very
   significant increase in the infrastructure bandwidth consumption. In
   order to be efficient in terms of traffic forwarding, the virtualized
   networking solutions must assure that packets traverse the transport
   network only once.

   It must be also possible to send the traffic directly from one end-
   system to another end-system without traversing through a midpoint
   router.

9. IP Mobility

   Another reason for a network virtualization is the need to support IP
   mobility. IP mobility consists in IP addresses used for communication
   within or between applications being located anywhere across the
   virtual network. Using a virtual topology, i.e., abstracting the
   externally visible network address from the underlying infrastructure
   address is an effective way to solve IP mobility problem.

   IP mobility consists in a device physically moving (e.g., a roaming
   wireless device) or a workload being transferred from one physical
   server/appliance to another. IP mobility requires preserving device's
   active network connections (e.g., TCP and higher-level sessions).
   Such mobility is also referred to as "live" migration with respect to
   a Virtual Machine. IP mobility is highly desirable for many reasons
   such as efficient and flexible resource sharing, data center
   migration, disaster recovery, server redundancy, or service bursting.

9.1. IP Addressing of Virtual Hosts

   To accommodate live mobility of a virtual machine (or a device), it
   is desirable to assign to it a semi-permanent IP address that remains
   with the VM/device as it moves. The semi-permanent IP address can be
   configured through VM configuration process or by means of DHCP.

9.2. Network Layer-Based Mobility

   When dealing with IP-only applications it is not only sufficient but
   optimal to forward the traffic based on layer 3 (network layer)
   rather than on layer 2 (data-link layer) information. The MAC
   addresses of devices or applications are irrelevant to IP services
   and introduce unnecessary overhead and complications when devices or
   VMs move. For example, when a VM moves between physical servers, the
   MAC learning tables in the switches must be updated. Moreover, it is
   possible that VM's MAC address might need to change in its new
   location. In IP-based network virtualization solution a device or a
   workload move is handled by an IP route advertisement.

9.3. Routing Convergence Requirements

   IP mobility has to be transparent to applications and any external
   entity interacting with the applications. This implies that the
   network connectivity restoration time is critical. The transport
   sessions can typically survive over several seconds of disruption,
   however, applications may have sub-second latency requirement for
   their correct operation.

   To minimize the disruption to established communication during

   workload or device mobility, the control plane of a network
   virtualization solution should be able to differentiate between the
   activation of a workload in a new location from advertising its route
   to the network. This will enable the remote end-points to update
   their routing tables prior to workload's migration as well as
   allowing the traffic to be tunneled via the workload's old location.

10. Inter-operability with Existing MPLS/BGP VPNs

   Service Providers want to tie their server-based offerings to their
   MPLS/BGP VPN services. MPLS/BGP VPNs provide secure and latency-
   optimized remote connectivity to the virtualized resources in SP's
   data center. The Service Provider-based VPN access can provide
   additional capabilities compared with public internet access, such as
   QoS, OAM, multicast service, VoIP service, video conferencing,
   wireless connectivity.

   MPLS/BGP VPN customers may require simultaneous access to resources
   in both SP and their own data centers.

   Service Providers want to "spin up" the L3VPN access to data center
   VPNs as dynamically as the spin up of compute and other virtualized
   resources.

   The network virtualization solution should be fully inter-operable
   with MPLS/BGP VPNs, including:

    - Inter-AS MPLS/BGP VPN Options A, B, and C [RFC4364].

    - BGP/MPLS VPN-capable network devices (such as routers and network
      appliances) should be able to participate directly in a virtual
      network that spans end-systems.

    - The network devices should be able to participate in isolated
      collections of end-systems, i.e., in isolated VPNs, as well as in
      overlapping VPNs (called "extranets" in BGP/MPLS VPN terminology).

    - The network devices should be able to participate in any-to-any
      and hub-and-spoke end-systems topologies.

      When connecting an end-system VPN with other services/networks, it
      should not be necessary to advertize the specific host routes but
      rather the aggregated routing information. A BGP/MPLS VPN-capable
      router or appliance can be used to aggregate VPN's IP routing
      information and advertize the aggregated prefixes. The aggregated
      prefixes should be advertized with the router/appliance IP address
      as BGP next-hop and with locally assigned aggregate 20-bit label.
      The aggregate label should trigger a destination IP lookup in its

      corresponding VRF on all the packets entering the virtual network.

      The inter-connection of end-system VPNs with traditional VPNs
      requires an integrated control plane and unified orchestration of
      network and end-system resources.

11. BGP Requirements in a Virtualized Environment

11.1. BGP Convergence and Routing Consistency

   BGP was designed to carry very large amount of routing information
   but it is not a very fast converging protocol. In addition, the
   routing protocols, including BGP, have traditionally favored
   convergence (i.e., responsiveness to route change due to failure or
   policy change) over routing consistency. Routing consistency means
   that a router forwards a packet strictly along the path adopted by
   the upstream routers. When responsiveness is favored, a router
   applies a received update immediately to its forwarding table before
   propagating the update to other routers, including those that
   potentially depend upon the outcome of the update. The route change
   responsiveness comes at the cost of routing blackholes and loops.

   Routing consistency in virtualized environments is important because
   multiple workloads can be simultaneously moved between different
   physical servers due to maintenance activities, for example. If
   packets sent by the applications that are being moved are dropped
   (because they do not follow a live path), the active network
   connections will be dropped. To minimize the disruption to the
   established communications during VM migration or device mobility,
   the live path continuity is required.

11.1.1. BGP IP Mobility Requirements

   In IP mobility, the network connectivity restoration time is
   critical. In fact, Service Provider networks already use routing and
   forwarding plane techniques that support fast failure restoration by
   pre-installing a backup path to a given destination. These techniques
   allow to forward traffic almost continuously using an indirect
   forwarding path or a tunnel to a given destination, and hence, are
   referred to as "local repair". The traffic path is restored locally
   at the destination's old location while the network converges to a
   backup path. Eventually, the network converges to an optimal path and
   bypasses the local repair. BGP assists in the local repair techniques
   by advertizing multiple and not only the best path to a given
   destination.

11.2. Optimization of Route Distribution

 


Napierala and Fang      Expires <April 18, 2014>               [Page 12]

INTERNET DRAFT           <BGP/MPLS IP VPN DCI>        <October 18, 2013>


   When virtual networks are triggered based on the IP communication,
   the Route Target Constraint extension [RFC4684] of BGP should be used
   to optimize the route distribution for sparse virtual network events.
   This technique ensures that only those VPN forwarders that have local
   participants in a particular data plane event receive its routing
   information. This also decreases the total load on the upstream BGP
   speakers.

11.3. Service chaining

   It is important to provide service chaining ability without major
   impact to the existing protocols deployed. One solution currently
   work in progress in IETF is [I-D.rfernando-l3vpn-service-chaining]. 

12. Security Considerations

   The document presents the requirements for end-systems MPLS/BGP VPNs.
   The security considerations for traditional MPLS/BGP VPN deployments
   are described in [RFC4364] in Section 13. Security issues associated
   with deployments using MPLS-in-GRE or MPLS-in-IP encapsulations are
   described in [RFC4023] in Section 8. And [RFC4111] provides general
   IP VPN security guidelines. 

   The additional security requirements specific to end-system MPLS/BGP
   VPNs are as follows:
    - End-systems MPLS/BGP VPNs solution should guarantee that packets
      originating from a specific end-system virtual interface are
      accepted only if the corresponding VPN IP host is present on that
      end-system.

    - Virtual network must ensure that traffic arriving at the egress
      end-system is being sent from the correct ingress end-system.

    - One virtual host or VM should not be able to impersonate another,
      during steady-state operation and during live migration.

      The security considerations for specific solutions will be
      documented in the relevant documents.
13. IANA Considerations

   This document contains no new IANA considerations.
