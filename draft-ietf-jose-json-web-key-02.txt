Internet-Draft                     JWK                          May 2012


1.  Introduction

   A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JSON data structure that represents a
   public key as a JSON object [RFC4627].  This specification also
   defines a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) JSON data structure for
   representing a set of JWKs.  Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers
   used with this specification are enumerated in the separate JSON Web
   Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification.

   Non-goals for this specification include representing private keys,
   representing symmetric keys, representing certificate chains,
   representing certified keys, and replacing X.509 certificates.

   JWKs are used in the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] "jwk" (JSON Web
   Key) header parameter and the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] "jwk"
   (JSON Web Key) and "epk" (Ephemeral Public Key) header parameters.
   The resources referenced by the JWS "jku" (JWK Set URL) and JWE "jku"
   (JWK Set URL) header parameters contain JWK Sets.


2.  Terminology

   JSON Web Key (JWK)  A JSON data structure that represents a public
      key.

   JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set)  A JSON object that contains an array of
      JWKs as a member.

   Base64url Encoding  For the purposes of this specification, this term
      always refers to the URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding
      described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], Section 5, with the (non URL-
      safe) '=' padding characters omitted, as permitted by Section 3.2.
      (See Appendix B of [JWS] for notes on implementing base64url
      encoding without padding.)


3.  Example JSON Web Key Set

   The following example JWK Set contains two public keys represented as
   JWKs: one using an Elliptic Curve algorithm and a second one using an
   RSA algorithm.  The first specifies that the key is to be used for
   encryption.  Both provide a Key ID for key matching purposes.  In
   both cases, integers are represented using the base64url encoding of
   their big endian representations.  (Long lines are broken are for
   display purposes only.)

4.  JSON Web Key (JWK) Format

   A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JSON object containing specific members, as
   specified below.  Those members that are common to all key types are
   defined below.

   JWKs also require members that are specific to the particular key
   algorithm family to represent the key parameters.  These algorithm
   specific members are defined in Section 5 of the JSON Web Algorithms
   (JWA) [JWA] specification.

   The member names within a JWK MUST be unique; objects with duplicate
   member names MUST be rejected.

   Additional members MAY be present in the JWK.  If present, they MUST
   be understood by implementations using them.  Parameters for
   representing keys for additional algorithm families or additional key
   properties SHOULD either be defined in the IANA JSON Web Key
   Parameters registry [JWA] or be a URI that contains a collision
   resistant namespace.

4.1.  "alg" (Algorithm Family) Parameter

   The "alg" (algorithm family) member identifies the cryptographic
   algorithm family used with the key.  A list of defined "alg" values
   is presented in Section 5.1 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]



Jones                   Expires November 13, 2012               [Page 4]

   specification.  Specific additional members are required to represent
   the key, depending upon the algorithm family.  These members are
   specified in Section 5 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specification.  The "alg" value is case sensitive.  Its value MUST be
   a string.

   "alg" values SHOULD either be defined in the IANA JSON Web Key
   Algorithm Families registry [JWA] or be a URI that contains a
   collision resistant namespace.

4.2.  "use" (Key Use) Parameter

   The "use" (key use) member identifies the intended use of the key.
   Values defined by this specification are "sig" (signature) and "enc"
   (encryption).  Other values MAY be used.  The "use" value is case
   sensitive.  Its value MUST be a string.  This member is OPTIONAL.

4.3.  "kid" (Key ID) Parameter

   The "kid" (key ID) member can be used to match a specific key.  This
   can be used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within the
   JWK during key rollover.  When used with JWS or JWE, the "kid" value
   MAY be used to match a JWS or JWE "kid" header parameter value.  The
   interpretation of the "kid" value is unspecified.  Its value MUST be
   a string.  This member is OPTIONAL.


5.  JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) Format

   A JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) is a JSON object that contains an array
   of JSON Web Key values as the value of its "keys" member.

   The member names within a JWK Set MUST be unique; objects with
   duplicate member names MUST be rejected.

   Additional members MAY be present in the JWK Set. If present, they
   MUST be understood by implementations using them.  Parameters for
   representing additional properties of JWK Sets SHOULD either be
   defined in the IANA JSON Web Key Set Parameters registry Section 6.1
   or be a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.

5.1.  "keys" (JSON Web Key Set) Parameter

   The value of the "keys" (JSON Web Key Set) member is an array of JSON
   Web Key (JWK) values.  This member is REQUIRED.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  JSON Web Key Set Parameters Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA JSON Web Key Set Parameters
   registry for reserved JWK Set parameter names.  Inclusion in the
   registry is RFC Required in the RFC 5226 [RFC5226] sense.  The
   registry records the reserved parameter name and a reference to the
   RFC that defines it.  This specification registers the parameter
   names defined in Section 5.


7.  Security Considerations

   A key is no more trustworthy than the method by which it was
   received.

   The security considerations in XML DSIG 2.0
   [W3C.CR-xmldsig-core2-20120124], about public key representations
   also apply to this specification, other than those that are XML
   specific.


8.  Open Issues and Things To Be Done (TBD)

Appendix A.  Acknowledgements

   A JSON representation for RSA public keys was previously introduced
   in Magic Signatures [MagicSignatures].


Appendix B.  Document History

   -02

   o  Simplified JWK terminology to get replace the "JWK Key Object" and
      "JWK Container Object" terms with simply "JSON Web Key (JWK)" and
      "JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set)" and to eliminate potential confusion
      between single keys and sets of keys.  As part of this change, the
      top-level member name for a set of keys was changed from "jwk" to
      "keys".

   o  Clarified that values with duplicate member names MUST be
      rejected.

   o  Established JSON Web Key Set Parameters registry.

   o  Explicitly listed non-goals in the introduction.

   o  Moved algorithm-specific definitions from JWK to JWA.

   o  Reformatted to give each member definition its own section
      heading.
