Abstract

   Application-layer protocols generally use global addresses.  The
   global address is based on the Domain Name System (DNS) as it
   provides a namespace structure which can used to generate a global
   address.  This document discusses about domain names in applications
   and the history of domain names in application-layer protocols.

1. Introduction

   Application-layer protocols generally use global addresses.  The
   global address is based on the Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034] as
   it provides namespace where authority can be delegated.  In addition,
   DNS can provide the information which is necessary for applications
   to exchange messages.  This document discusses about domain names in
   applications and the history of domain names in application
   protocols.

2. History

   The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was specified as a standard
   in RFC 821 [RFC0821].  It used the then recently introduced concept
   of domains in the ARPA Internet mail system.  The use of domains
   changed the address space from a flat global space of simple
   character string host names to a hierarchically structured rooted
   tree of global addresses.  The host name was replaced by a domain and
   host designator which is a sequence of domain element strings
   separated by periods.

   It was usually assumed that a mail service would be available at a
   domain name.  There were situations where hosts were not accessible

   over the Internet.  The DNS mail-exchange (MX) Resource Record
   [RFC1035] was specified RFC 974 [RFC0974] to provide routing
   information which can be used to locate a mail service for a domain
   name.  Some general requirements which may be applicable to all
   application-layer protocols were set in RFC 1123 [RFC1123].  That
   document introduced the term "fully-qualified domain name" (FQDN).

3. Domain Names in Application-Layer Protocols

3.1. File Transfer Protocol

   The File Transfer protocol (FTP) [RFC0959] requires IP addresses
   instead of domain names to transfer files from or to a host.

3.2. Hypertext Transfer Protocol

   A fully-qualified domain name is generally used by the Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] to access a resource referenced by
   a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986].  URIs generally
   contain a fully-qualified domain name component which is intended for
   lookup in the DNS.

3.3. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

   The domain part used in the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
   [RFC5321] are expected to be fully-qualified domain names.

4. Domain Part

   The syntax of a valid Internet hostname was specified in RFC 952
   [RFC0952].  The determination of what constitutes a valid hostname or
   fully-qualified domain name is known as the LDH rule.  Components of
   a fully-qualified domain are delimited by a period (".").  The (DNS)
   term "label" is used to refer to a component.  A label can contain
   characters such as letters, digits or hyphens.  The first and last
   characters in a label cannot be a hyphen.

   It is recommended to use a fully-qualified domain name in an
   application-layer protocol as such a domain part is globally
   addressable.  Using a fully-qualified domain name also ensures that
   the domain part can be interpreted consistently regardless of
   context.

4.1. Domain Name System

   The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol [RFC1035] uses the following
   syntax:

Internet-Draft        Domain Names in Applications          July 1, 2012


     <domain> ::= <subdomain> | " "

     <subdomain> ::= <label> | <subdomain> "." <label>

     <label> ::= <letter> [ [ <ldh-str> ] <let-dig> ]

     <ldh-str> ::= <let-dig-hyp> | <let-dig-hyp> <ldh-str>

     <let-dig-hyp> ::= <let-dig> | "-"

     <let-dig> ::= <letter> | <digit>

     <letter> ::= any one of the 52 alphabetic characters A through Z in
     upper case and a through z in lower case

     <digit> ::= any one of the ten digits 0 through 9

   Note that while upper and lower case letters are allowed in domain
   names, no significance is attached to the case.  That is, two names
   with the same spelling but different case are to be treated as if
   identical.

   There are also some restrictions on the length [RFC1035].  A label is
   63 octets or less.  A (domain) name is 255 octets or less.

4.2. Domain Part Syntax

   The DNS specifications provide general rules for constructing domain
   names.  Both the rules defined in the DNS specifications and the
   application-layer protocol specification are applicable for a domain
   part.

   RFC 5321 [RFC5321] uses the following Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) [RFC5234]:

     Domain         = sub-domain *("." sub-domain)

     sub-domain     = Let-dig [Ldh-str]

     Let-dig        = ALPHA / DIGIT

     Ldh-str        = *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" ) Let-dig

   To ensure consistency, this syntax is recommended when designing a
   new application-layer protocol which defines a domain part.

4.3 Using the Domain Part

Internet-Draft        Domain Names in Applications          July 1, 2012


   Application-layer protocols use the domain part in different ways. 
   In HTTP, for example, the domain part can be resolved to an IP
   address to connect to the target host.  In SMTP, the target host is
   not necessarily the final destination of a message; the domain part
   can be used to derive routing information.

5. Internationalization Considerations

   RFC 5890 [RFC5890] discusses about Internationalized Domain Names for
   Applications (IDNA).  It is recommended that application-layer
   protocol implementers read the document if they are taking decisions
   about the handling of domain name strings.

6. Security Considerations

   The DNS security extensions, known as DNSSEC [RFC4033], provides
   origin authentication and integrity assurance services for DNS data. 
   Any application should use a security-aware resolver for DNS queries.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.

8.  Acknowledgments

   The idea for this document came up after the author read a message
   from Barry Leiba about the domain names.  Some parts of the document
   would never have been written if John Klensin did not patiently
   explain why the author was wrong in discussions about RFC 5321.  The
   author would like to thank Craig Partridge for taking the time to
   reply to a question about RFC 974 a few years ago.  David H. Crocker
   introduced the term "global address" in RFC 822.  Parts of Section
   4.1 was extracted from RFC 1035 written by P. Mockapetris.  Section
   4.2 is from RFC 5321 written by John Klensin.
