      <t>Path computation element (PCE) can be used to compute a label switched path that spans across multiple domains. This document explain the mechanism of Fast Re-Route (FRR) where a point of local repair (PLR) needs to find the appropriate merge point (MP) to do bypass path computation using PCE.  </t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) <xref target="RFC4655"/> can be used to perform complex path computation in large single domain, multi-domain and multi-layered networks. The PCE can also be used to compute a variety of restoration and protection paths and services.</t>
      <t>As stated in <xref target="RFC4090"/>, there are two independent methods (one-to-one backup and facility backup) of doing fast reroute (FRR). PCE can be used to compute backup path for both the methods. Cooperating PCEs may be used to compute inter-domain backup path. </t>
      <t>In case of one to one backup method, the destination MUST be the tail-end of the protected LSP.  Whereas for facility backup, destination MUST be the address of the merge point (MP) from the corresponding point of local repair (PLR). The problem of finding the MP using the interface addresses or node-ids present in Record Route Object (RRO) of protected path can be easily solved in the case of a single Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area because the PLR has the complete Traffic Engineering Database (TED). Thus, the PLR can unambiguously determine - </t>
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>The MP address regardless of RRO IPv4 or IPv6 sub-objects (interface address or LSR ID).</t>
      <t>Is a backup tunnel intersecting a protected TE LSP on MP node exists? This is the case where facility backup tunnel already exist either due to another protected TE LSP or it is pre-configured.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <t>It is complex for a PLR to find the MP in case of boundary node protection for computing a bypass path because the PLR doesn't have the full TED visibility. When confidentiality (via path key) <xref target="RFC5520"/> is enabled, finding MP is very complex. </t>
      <t>This document describes the mechanism to find MP and to setup bypass tunnel to protect a boundary node.</t>

      <t>The Merge Point (MP) address is required at the PLR in order to select a bypass tunnel intersecting a protected Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) on a downstream LSR.</t>
      <t>Some implementations may choose to pre-configure a bypass tunnel on PLR with destination address as MP. MP's Domain to be traversed by bypass path can be administratively configured or learned via some other means (ex Hierarchical PCE (HPCE) <xref target="PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK"/>). Path Computation Client (PCC) on PLR can request its local PCE to compute bypass path from PLR to MP, excluding links and node between PLR and MP. At PLR once primary tunnel is up, a pre-configured bypass tunnel is bound to the primary tunnel, note that multiple bypass tunnel can also exist. </t>
      <t>Most implementations may choose to create a bypass tunnel on PLR after primary tunnel is signaled with Record Route Object (RRO) being present in primary path's Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Path Reserve message. MP address has to be determined (described below) to create a bypass tunnel. PCC on PLR can request its local PCE to compute bypass path from PLR to MP, excluding links and node between PLR and MP.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="fig1"/>, R2 has to build a bypass tunnel that protects against the failure of link [R2->R3] and node [R3]. R2 is PLR and R4 is MP in this case. Since, both PLR and MP belong to the same area. The problem of finding the MP using the interface addresses or node-ids can be easily solved. Thus, the PLR can unambiguously find the MP address regardless of RRO IPv4 or IPv6 sub-objects (interface address or LSR ID) and also determine whether a backup tunnel intersecting a protected TE LSP on a downstream node (MP) already exists. </t> 
      <t>TED on PLR will have the information of both R2 and R4, which can be used to find MP's TE router IP address and compute optimal backup path from R2 to R4, excluding link [R2->R3] and node [R3].</t>

PCE MAY use inter-domain path computation mechanism (like HPCE (<xref target="PCE-HIERARCHY-FWK"/>) etc) when the domain information of MP is unknown at PLR. Further, RSVP-TE can signal bypass tunnel along the computed path.</t>
