  Recent changes in response to email.

  These email messages were very old but there was a comment in the
  XML source that we may have missed chages from them.  Two changes
  result from these.

     Message-ID:
     201004110429.o3B4TEmM096179@harbor.orleans.occnc.com

     > FR: The precision of latency reporting should be at least 10% of
     > the one way latency for latency of 1 ms or more.

     Can we just state that it be configurable and that the default be
     ... [as stated].

     [...]

     If you are considering keeping the text as is, then change "overload"
     to something more meaningful, like maybe "congestion and queueing
     delay" and make the last sentence a sentence (grammar doesn't parse).

     This was the last in a thread started by Iftekhar Hussain.  These
     were six action items identified.

  #1  Some rewording is needed in Section 3 to clarify MPLS based
      component vs physical link component, the latter inclucing the
      link layer.

  #2  Add a cross reference to CL framework in Section 4.1.

  #3  Add cross reference to CL framework near FR#8 and FR#9 regarding
      delay metric granularity and inclusion of queuing delay and the
      potential impacts on performance, oscillations, and stability.

  #4  Add a cross reference to CL Use Cases in Section 4.3 to point
      toward the brief description and references that support the
      statement "Many techniques have been developed to balance the
      distribution of flows across component links that connect the
      same pair of nodes" and "...via composite links, other
      techniques have been developed."

  #5  Briefly explain the "delay discontinuity" that occurs when load
      balancing puts traffic on a new path and clarify what is meant
      by "minimally disruptive".

  #6  It may help in some cases to clarify that something must be
      implemented but must, should, or may be configurable and
      therefore may be optionally deployed.  Doing so may require a
      small change to many requirements as in most cases we have only
      indicated where something must be implemented.

     The suggested text from these was:

  [FR#N]   Load balancing MAY be used during sustained low traffic
           periods to reduce the number of active component links for
           the purpose of power reduction.

  As with any load balancing change, a change initiated for the
  purpose of power reduction may be minimally disruptive.  Typically
  the disruption is limited to a change in delay characteristics and
  the potential for a very brief period with traffic reordering.  The
  network operator when configuring a network for power reduction
  should weight the benefit of power reduction against the
  disadvantage of a minimal disruption.

    <abstract>
      <t>
	There is often a need to provide large aggregates of bandwidth
	that are best provided using parallel links between routers or
	MPLS LSR.  In core networks there is often no alternative
	since the aggregate capacities of core networks today far
	exceed the capacity of a single physical link or single packet
	processing element.
      </t>
      <t>
	The presence of parallel links, with each link potentially
	comprised of multiple layers has resulted in additional
	requirements.  Certain services may benefit from being
	restricted to a subset of the component links or a specific
	component link, where component link characteristics, such as
	latency, differ.  Certain services require that an LSP be
	treated as atomic and avoid reordering.  Other services will
	continue to require only that reordering not occur within a
	microflow as is current practice.

      <t>
	Current practice related to multipath is described briefly in

	      capacity of the composite link, the solution SHOULD define
	      a means to cause the LSPs for some traffic flows to move
	      to some other point in the network that is not
	      congested. These "preempted LSPs" may not be restored if
	      there is no uncongested path in the network.

	  The intent is to measure the predominant latency in
	  uncongested service provider networks, where geographic
	  delay dominates and is on the order of milliseconds or more.
	  The argument for including queuing delay is that it reflects
	  the delay experienced by applications.  The argument against
	  including queuing delay is that it if used in routing
	  decisions it can result in routing instability.  This
	  tradeoff is discussed in detail in <xref

	  Corresponding to Case 1 of <xref target="ITU-T.G.800" />, as
	  one means to provide high availability, network operators
	  deploy a topology in the MPLS network using lower layer
	  networks that have a certain degree of diversity at the
	  lower layer(s).  Many techniques have been developed to
	  balance the distribution of flows across component links
	  that connect the same pair of nodes.  When the path for a
	  flow can be chosen from a set of candidate nodes connected
	  via composite links, other techniques have been developed.
	  Refer to the Appendices in <xref
	  target="I-D.symmvo-rtgwg-cl-use-cases" /> for a

	      The solution SHALL measure traffic on a labeled traffic

	    <t>
	      When a traffic flow is moved from one component link to

	      The solution SHALL provide a means to identify flows
	      whose rearrangement frequency needs to be bounded by a

	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means that communicates
	      whether the flows within an LSP can be split across

	      perform this function.
	    </t>

	      The solution SHALL provide a means to indicate that a
	      traffic flow shall select a component link with the
	      minimum latency value.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to indicate that a

	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means local to a node that
	      automatically distributes flows across the component links
	      in the composite link such that NPOs are met.
	   </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to distribute flows
	      from a single LSP across multiple component links to
	      handle at least the case where the traffic carried in an
	      LSP exceeds that of any component link in the composite
	      link. As defined in section 3, a flow is a sequence of
	      packets that must be transferred on one component link.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHOULD support the use case where a
	      composite link itself is a component link for a higher
	      order composite link.  For example, a composite link
	      comprised of MPLS-TP bi-directional tunnels viewed as
	      logical links could then be used as a component link in
	      yet another composite link that connects MPLS routers.

	    <t>
	      The solution MUST support an optional means for LSP
	      signaling to bind an LSP to a particular component link
	      within a composite link.  If this option is not
	      exercised, then an LSP that is bound to a composite link
	      may be bound to any component link matching all other
	      signaled requirements, and different directions of a
	      bidirectional LSP can be bound to different component
	      links.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution MUST support a means to indicate that

	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  A minimally disruptive change implies that as little
	  disruption as is practical occurs.  Such a change can be
	  achieved with zero packet loss.  A delay discontinuity may
	  occur, which is considered to be a minimally disruptive
	  event for most services if this type of event is
	  sufficiently rare.  A delay discontinuity is an example of a
	  minimally disruptive behavior corresponding to current
	  techniques.
	</t>
	<t>
	  A delay discontinuity is an isolated event which may greatly
	  exceed the normal delay variation (jitter).  A delay
	  discontinuity has the following effect.  When a flow is
	  moved from a current link to a target link with lower
	  latency, reordering can occur.  When a flow is moved from a
	  current link to a target link with a higher latency, a time
	  gap can occur.  Some flows (e.g., timing distribution, PW
	  circuit emulation) are quite sensitive to these effects.  A
	  delay discontinuity can also cause a jitter buffer underrun
	  or overrun affecting user experience in real time voice
	  services (causing an audible click).  These sensitivities
	  may be specified in an NPO.

	    When the nodes connected via a composite link are in the

	    When the nodes are connected via a composite link are in

	    The solution SHOULD support composite link IGP
	    advertisement that results in convergence time better than

	    of capabilities of the individual component links such
	    that functional requirements are met, and also minimizes
	    the frequency of advertisement updates which may cause IGP
	    convergence to occur.

	    bandwidth utilization.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When a worst case failure scenario occurs, the number of
	    RSVP-TE LSPs to be resignaled will cause a period of
	    unavailability as perceived by users. The resignaling time
	    of the solution MUST meet the NPO objective for the

	these requirements are met using MPLS signaling as commonly
	practiced today with authenticated but unencrypted OSPF-TE,
	ISIS-TE, and RSVP-TE or LDP, then the requirement to provide

	would require a capability to monitor this signaling either
	through a provider breach or access to provider physical
	transmission infrastructure.  A provider breach already poses
	a threat of numerous tpes of attacks which are of far more
	serious consequence.  Encrption of the signaling can prevent
