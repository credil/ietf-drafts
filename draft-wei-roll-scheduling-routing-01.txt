Abstract 


   Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics 
   compared with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks. Low Latency 
   Deterministic Networks(LLDN) is specified in IEEE 802.15.4e which is 
   for deterministic applications in the industrial environment. Some 
   routing metrics and constraints has been described in [RFC6551], 
   [RFC5867] [RFC5826], [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]. There are several 
   special characteristics and requirements in the industrial 
   environment. This document defines a new Link Metric/Constraint 
   Object-Scheduling Waiting Time to make RPL support deterministic 
   scheduling mechanism, which could improve the determinacy and 
   reliability of the LLNs in industrial environment.

1. Introduction 

   This document makes use of the terminology defined in [ROLL-TERMS]. 

   Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) consist largely of constrained 
   nodes (with limited processing power, memory, and sometimes energy 
   when they are battery operated or energy scavenging). Low-power and 
   Lossy Networks (LLNs) have specific routing characteristics compared 
   with traditional wired or ad hoc networks that have been spelled out 
   in [RFC5548], [RFC5673], [RFC5826], and [RFC5867].  

   IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is 
   specified in [RFC6550], which provides a mechanism whereby 
   multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a 
   central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the 
   central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported. 
   The routing metrics and constraints are specified in [RFC6551], which 
   provides a high degree of flexibility and a set of routing metrics 
   and constraints. A variety of node constraints/metrics must be 
   possible taken into account during path computation (see RFC[6551]).  

   The routing metrics and constraints specified in [RFC6551] are not 
   specific to any particular link layer. It is really an excellent

   design criterion that the independence between RPL and link layer. 
   However, RPL is expected to be more suitable for industrial 
   application. In industrial wireless application, cross-layer design 
   needed to be considered to promote the performances of the 
   determinism scheduling, which is not only related to link layer, but 
   also affects the routing. This document focuses on the determinism 
   applications, such as wireless industrial applications. In this case, 
   the data link layer is designed based on the determinism scheduling 
   mechanism to meet the deterministic during communications. The main 
   factor of influencing the communication latency is scheduling waiting 
   time. The DLL cannot avoid influencing routing choice. The specific 
   routing metrics and constraints should be considered to promote using 
   RPL in the industrial deterministic application. Therefore, we design 
   a new metrics and constraints, to make it support determinism 
   scheduling applications. 

   Low Latency Deterministic Networks(LLDN) is specified in IEEE 
   802.15.4e  which is organized as a star network with a superframe 
   structure and using low latency frames. In this document, we will 
   discuss how to use RPL with Object-Scheduling Time in LLDN. The 
   network coordinator of a low latency network indicates the existence 
   of such a low latency network by periodically sending low latency-
   beacons. Allocating a dedicated time slot for each LLDN device 
   provides a deterministic system. The IEEE 802.15.4 DSSS coding 
   together with the exclusive channel access for each LLDN device 
   ensures high reliability of the system. Small time slots and short 
   packets lead to superframes as small as 10ms, which provides a 
   latency of less than 10ms and a low round trip time. The number of 
   slots in a superframe determines the number of LLDN devices that can 
   access each channel.  

   Determinism is one of the most important requirements in industrial 
   application. It has two meanings, one is the deterministic during 
   single-hop communication, and the other is the deterministic during 
   multi-hop  communication.  The  deterministic  during  single-hop 
   communication is guaranteed by the determinism scheduling mechanism. 
   The determinism scheduling mechanism makes certain nodes communicate 
   in certain slot. The determinism during multi-hop communication is 
   guaranteed by routing. Routing could ensure the whole scheduling time 
   during the path inside the constraint of users. 
  
   This document specifies Object-Scheduling Waiting Time as the routing 
   metrics and constraints to be used in path calculation for Low 
   Latency Deterministic Networks.  

   The new metrics and constraints we define in this document could be 
   advertised as a metric to optimize the computed path and as a

   constraint. It could be used as one of the multi-metrics and work 
   with the others. When using a dynamic routing metric in LLND, a RPL 
   implementation should use multi-threshold schemes to void spurious 
   and unnecessary routing changes. For the object format structure, the 
   additional field is not added. The reserved bit is used. However, the 
   new object needs to be transmitted during the networking stage, which 
   in fact needs extra overhead of 4 bytes. While the network scheduling 
   information changes, we need re-send a new value. Otherwise, if 
   network scheduling information does not change, there is no need to 
   send new value. 

   It must be noted that the superframe structure has be decided during 
   the networking period in LLDN. We assume the superframe structure has 
   been known for each node.  

   Note that the deterministic system is based on global synchronization. 
   Time synchronization is very crucial in industrial wireless 
   applications. Usually some special mechanisms and protocols are 
   designed and implemented to ensure time synchronization. This 
   document focuses on determinism routing. The determinism routing 
   metrics and constraints specified in this document are not specific 
   to any particular synchronization mechanism. 

        

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFC 2119]. 

1.2. Terms Used  

   MAC:     Medium Access Control 

   CSMA/CA: Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance 

   TDMA:    Time Division Multiple Address 

   GTS:     Guaranteed Time Slot 

   Safety:   It means the system's safety of industrial environment, 
   including the safety of devices and human safety. 

   Security:  It means the specific security mechanism or security 
   algorithm.

   Scheduling waiting time: The time is used to for a node have to wait 
   to send data to a special node in a period. When the MAC layer 
   schedules the slot time and channel resources of network with TDMA 
   mechanism, every node get send slots and receive slots. In this 
   case if node A wants to send data to node B, it have to send data in 
   its send time slot, which is also the receive time slot of node B. 
   The time from the start time of transmit period to the slot above 
   mentioned is the scheduling waiting time from node A to node B. If 
   the network supports broadcasting mechanism, when node A broadcast a 
   messages in a slot, while the other nodes are just at their receive 
   slots. 

   Determinism:  It is usually meant that access to the control network 
   by a node may be delayed, where t is known. In industrial wireless 
   network, it also means that data is sent and received within the 
   stipulated time. 

        

2. Requirements 

   Wireless system has been widely used in factory automation area for 
   its low cost and availability. The requirements from the industrial 
   environment for a routing protocol in Low power and Lossy Networks 
   (LLNs) is analyzed in [RFC5673] based on IPv6 to power the next 
   generation of control technology, such as traffic characteristics 
   reliability requirements; device-aware routing requirements; 
   broadcast/multicast requirements; protocol performance requirements; 
   mobility requirements; manageability requirements; antagonistic 
   requirements and so on.  

   RPL has a lot of abilities to support the industrial environments, 
   which includes: 

     a) 
        RPL coexists with optimized routes, for construction of initial 
        suboptimal routes and for repair of optimized routes; 

     b) 
        RPL is adequate for non-production phases (unit startup and 
        shutdown),   for   emergency   rerouting,   for   non-critical 
        applications, for small plants; 

     c) 
        Mobile devices (e.g., cranes) may need RPL; 

     d) 
        When using a reference (optimize d) DODAG version from a 
        centralized computer, RPL would provide local repair.

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-roll-scheduling-routing-01   October 2012 
        

        
   However, an emphasis is placed on the requirements to be met by 
   deterministic  applications  with  regard  to  reliability  and 
   availability. In this document, we will discuss the deterministic 
   networks metrics and design the mechanism to use these metrics to 
   optimize routing. 

        

3. Object Formats 

   Routing metrics and constraints are carried within the DAG Metric 
   Container object defined in [RFC6550].The Routing Metric/Constraint 
   objects represent a metric or a constraint of a particular type. They 
   may appear in any order in the DAG Metric Container (specified in 
   [RFC6550]). They have a common format consisting of one or more bytes 
   with a common header. The Routing Metric/Constraint Object Generic 
   Format has been defined in [RFC6551] as following. 

     0                   1               2                   3

4. Scheduling Waiting Time Object 

4.1. Scheduling Waiting Time Description 

   In this section, we define the Scheduling Waiting Time Object 
   attached to the Link Metric/Constraint Objects, used for supporting 
   scheduling operations.  

   Similar to Link Latency Object, the Scheduling Waiting Time of many 
   LLN MAC sub-layers can vary over many orders of magnitude, again with 
   a corresponding change in power consumption. The Scheduling Waiting 
   Time Object is optional, and it is used based on user's requirement.  

   The Scheduling Waiting Time object SHOULD be present in the DAG

   Metric Container. There MUST NOT be more than one Scheduling Waiting 
   Time object as a constraint per DAG Metric Container, and there MUST 
   NOT be more than one Scheduling Waiting Time object as a metric per 
   DAG Metric Container. 

   The Scheduling Time object is made of Scheduling Waiting Time sub-
   objects and MUST at least comprise one Scheduling Time sub-object. 
   Each Scheduling Waiting Time sub-object has a fixed length of 4 bytes. 

   The Scheduling Waiting Time object does not contain any additional 
   TLVs. 

   The Scheduling Waiting Time object Type is proposed to be set to 9 of 
   the reserved symbols, which must be confirmed by IANA. The format of 
   the Scheduling Waiting Time object body is as follows: 

    0                   1        
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3

   32 bits in unsigned integer format, expressed in microseconds. 

4.2. Mode of Operation 

   The Scheduling Waiting Time may be used as a constraint or a path 
   metric.  

   For example, user may want the Scheduling Waiting Time not to exceed 
   some value.  In this case, the Scheduling Waiting Time object common 
   header indicates that the provided value relates to a constraint. In 
   another example, the Scheduling Waiting Time object may be used as an 
   aggregated additive metric where the value is updated along the path 
   to reflect the path Scheduling Waiting Time.

5. RPL instance with Scheduling Waiting Time object 

   There is an instance to explain how to use Scheduling Waiting Time 
   object to be as a metric and constraint. The topology of the network 
   is show as Fig.4.

                           Figure 4 RPL instance 

   In the original RPL, DIO and DAO are used to construct and maintain 
   these DODAGs. The Objective Function (OF) defines how RPL nodes 
   select and optimize routes within a RPL instance. The OF defines how 
   nodes translate one or more metrics and constraints, which are 
   defined in [RFC6551], into a value called Rank, which approximates 
   the node's distance from a DODAG root. 

   There are two possible routings from A to E. We will discuss the 
   situation deterministic system, in the case, Scheduling Waiting Time 
   object could be used as the metric and constraint.  For example, it 
   is noted that the MAC layer in industrial standards, including 
   ISA100.11a, WirelessHart and WIA-PA standards, defines the slot time 
   and channel resources of network with TDMA and ACA  Adaptive Channel 
   Allocation  mechanism. In the following example, we define a 
   timeslot as 10 ms.

                 Figure 5 A scheduling instance in a LLDN 

        

   As mentioned before, node A has two routes choices to send data to 
   node E. In the case of deterministic system, each node has to receive 
   or send data in a scheduled timeslots, which is decided by superframe. 
      

   As shown in Fig.5, allocating a dedicated time slot for each LLDN 
   device provides a deterministic system. There is a superframe, which 
   is decided by the system manager. Small time slots and short packets 
   lead to superframes as small as 10ms, which provides a latency of 
   less than 10ms and a low round trip time. The number of slots in a

   superframe determines the number of LLDN devices that can access each 
   channel. 

   There are 15 timeslots in the superframe, which has been allocated to 
   each node. We define them as timeslot 1, timeslot 2 ... timeslot 15.

  The routing construct messages are advertised from node A. In the 
  timeslot 1, node A could send data to node B. Then in the timeslot 3, 
  node A could send data to node C. Therefore, the Scheduling Waiting 
  Time from A to B is 10ms, as well as, the Scheduling Waiting Time 
  from A to C is 30ms.  

        

   As shown in Fig.6, when the message has been sent to node C from node 
   A, node C forward the message to node D. In this deterministic system, 
   if node C wants to send data to node D, it have to send data at 
   timeslot 9 according to the superframe. Therefore the Scheduling 
   Waiting Time from C to D is 60ms. Then the total schedule waiting 
   time in the route A-C-D is 9 timeslots, which is equal to 90ms.

   It is similar for the situation in the other side as shown in Fig.7. 

   The Schedule Waiting Time from node A to node B is 10ms. Then the 
   message has been forward to E, node B has to wait 90ms to get the 
   send timeslot in timeslot 10. Then node E must wait 3 timeslots. When 
   the message has been to node D, the total Schedule Waiting Time is 
   150ms. 

   The total Schedule Waiting Times of the different routes are 
   different. There are about 3 timeslots delay could be optimized if we 
   consider Schedule Waiting Time as a metric.  

   It is similar to use the Schedule Waiting Time as a metric in 
   construct downward routes. 

   The Schedule Waiting Time may be used as a constraint also. When used 
   as constraint, the Schedule Waiting Time object may be inserted in 
   the DAG 

   Metric Container to indicate that links with a specific Schedule 
   Waiting Time should be included or excluded from the computed path. 

        

6. Security Considerations 

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models 
   within associated protocols.

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-roll-scheduling-routing-01   October 2012 
       

7. IANA Considerations 

   The definition of each field is defined in [RFC6551].  
   In this document, the Scheduling Waiting Time Object follows the 
   format. Considering several fields of this format is managed by IANA. 
   We discuss the possibility of new registry for the new object. 

   A new top-level registry, called "RPL Routing Metric/Constraint", has 
   been established by IANA to contain all Routing Metric/Constraint 
   objects codepoints and sub-registries. 

   The allocation policy for each new registry is by IETF review: new 
   values are assigned through the IETF review process (see [RFC5226]). 
   Specifically, new assignments are made via RFCs approved by the IESG. 
   Typically, the IESG will seek input on prospective assignments from 
   appropriate persons (e.g., a relevant working group if one exists). 

   New bit numbers may be allocated only by an IETF Review action.  Each 
   bit should be tracked with the following qualities: 

          1. Bit number 

          2. Capability Description 

          3. Defining RFC 

   As shown in Fig.1, Routing Metric/Constraint object types has been 
   defined by IANA as following, which range from 0 to 255.  Value 0 is 
   unassigned. 

              Value     Meaning                         Reference
