             Auxiliary Object Class 'mailboxRelatedObject'
                 draft-stroeder-mailboxrelatedobject-02

Abstract

   This document defines the auxiliary object class
   'mailboxRelatedObject' that can be used to associate an arbitrary
   object with a RFC 2822 mail address.  Furthermore a attribute
   'intlMailAdr' is defined for internationalized email addresses.

1.  Introduction

   Often there is a need to add attribute 'mail' defined in [RFC4524] to
   directory entries to associate a, most times non-personal, RFC 2822
   mail address with an arbitrary object.

   This document defines the auxiliary object class
   'mailboxRelatedObject' for that purpose so abusing person object
   classes like 'inetOrgPerson' defined in [RFC2798] for non-personal
   mail addresses is not needed.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document is being discussed on the ldapext@ietf.org mailing
   list.

2.  Attribute Type Definition

   The attribute type 'intlMailAdr' is defined for storing
   internationalized email addressess like used in [RFC6530] and
   [RFC6530].

    ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.5427.1.389.4.18
      NAME 'intlMailAdr'
      DESC 'Internationalized Email Address'
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

Internet-Draft        LDAP Mailbox Related Objects             July 2013


   Entries of auxiliary object class 'mailboxRelatedObject' MAY contain
   the following optional attributes: 'mail' [RFC4524] 'displayName'
   [RFC2798] 'intlMailAdr'

    ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.5427.1.389.6.9
      NAME 'mailboxRelatedObject'
      DESC 'Associated RFC 2822 mailbox for any entry'
      AUXILIARY
      MAY ( displayName $ mail $ intlMailAdr ) )


4.  IANA Considerations

   The OID arc used for the object class defintion is:
   iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4) enter-prise(1)
   stroeder.com(5427) public(1) ldap(389) objectClasses(6)

5.  Security Considerations

   The introduction of these object classes does not impact the security
   of the Internet or a particular LDAP directory service.

   Security considerations for LDAP in general are discussed in
   documents comprising the technical specification [RFC4510].
