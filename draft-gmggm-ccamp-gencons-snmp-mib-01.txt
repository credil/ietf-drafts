      A SNMP MIB to manage GMPLS with General Constraints support
                 draft-gmggm-ccamp-gencons-snmp-mib-01

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for GMPLS based
   networks.

   In particular in the context Wavelength Switching Optical Network
   (WSON) two sets of information were defined: a general constrains set
   (reusable by other technologies) and a WSON specific set.  This
   document defines a MIB module for supporting general constrain
   information.

Internet-Draft         GMPLS General Constrain MIB          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in GMPLS networks
   in patricular for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) as
   defined in [RFC6163].

   Those extentions were divided in two parts: generic constrains (as
   they can be easily applied to other technologies) and WSON specific
   contraints.  This document aim to defines MIBs extentions to conver
   only the generic constrain part.  The WSON specific MIB extentions
   will be covered by a separate document
   [I-D.gmggm-ccamp-wson-snmp-mib].

   As such, document [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode] defines
   specific TLVs while
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-general-constraints-ospf-te] implement OSPF-TE
   related extentions.  This MIB document aim to cover information
   defined in those general constrain drafts.

   [EDITOR NOTE] Very early draft to start MIB activity on GMPSL-WSON
   related extentions and collect feedback from working group.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] In
   the description of OIDs the convention: Set (S) Get (G) and Trap (T)
   conventions will describe the action allowed by the paramenter.

Internet-Draft         GMPLS General Constrain MIB          October 2012


4.  Overview

   Regarding exsting GMPLS MIBs modules, since the TED module
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ted-mib] already provide and extention to
   previous GMPLS modules, we provide here a direct extention to it.
   Additional GMPLS MIB modules this document uses are [RFC4802] and
   [RFC4803].

   Current GMPLS MIBs are covered by several documents.  The most
   important to refererence here are the [RFC4802] and [RFC4803].  Most
   recent works on GMPLS MIBs is in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ted-mib],
   whenever possible this document will reuse the same approach.

   General constrains can be classified in two broads categories: link
   information (as other GMPLS TED information) and Node information
   (this is different from what currently available).  For link
   information the most similar definions are the ones from [RFC4803]
   where the label table is defined.  For node information however, new
   specific information has to be defined.


5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   Modules defined here provide additional information to existing GMPLS
   MIBS in order to represent the general constrains information as
   reported in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode].  This module
   is organized into two tables as reported in the following sub
   sections.

5.1.  gmplsGenConsAvailableLabelsTable

   This object represent the Available Labels sub-TLV as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode] section 2.3.  The object
   represent a list of labels available on a given link, so the object
   looks very similar to gmplsLabelTable defined in [RFC4803] (so the
   GmplsLabelEntry might be reused here).  The table entry will likely
   need a reference to [I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ted-mib] (the index of the
   corresponding TED MIB entry).  The entry definition must report also
   the priority associated to the label set as defined in sub-TLV.

   Note that there should be some relationship among entries in this
   table and entries in gmplsLabelTable: if a label appears in this
   table, it cannot appear in gmplsLabelTable.

5.2.  gmplsGenConsSharedBackupLabelsTable

   This object is exactly the equivalent of gmplsGenConsAvailableLabels
   but for backup/restoration purpose.  The object table will be

Internet-Draft         GMPLS General Constrain MIB          October 2012


   different but the table entry will be the same as the previous table.

5.3.  gmplsGenConsNodeTable

   This table indicates the Node constraints introduced by
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode] as additional constrains
   compared to link/label constrains reported above.

   Among main information available in this table there are:

   o  Connectivity Matrixes.  This information represent some node
      internal constrain in term of connectivity.  More than one matrix
      can be defined for a node.

   o  Port Labels restrictions.  This information represent a constain
      on ports vs labels (i.e. some ports may not support all
      wavelenghts.

   TBD how to organize this information.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a



Galimberti, et al.       Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         GMPLS General Constrain MIB          October 2012


   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


9.  IANA Considerations

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

Internet-Draft         GMPLS General Constrain MIB          October 2012


   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
   draft MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in an internet draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
