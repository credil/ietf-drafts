     <t>This document defines common requirements for Carrier-Grade NAT
       (CGN). It updates RFC 4787.</t>
   </abstract>
 </front>

 <middle>
   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>With the shortage of IPv4 addresses, it is expected that more Internet
       Service Providers (ISPs) may want to provide a service where a public
       IPv4 address would be shared by many subscribers.  Each subscriber is
       assigned a private address, and a Network Address Translator (NAT) <xref
         target="RFC2663"/> situated in the ISP's network translates between
       private and public addresses. When a second IPv4 NAT is located at the
       customer edge, this results in two layers of NAT.</t>

     <t>This service can conceivably be offered alongside others, such as IPv6
       services or regular IPv4 service assigning public addresses to
       subscribers. Some ISPs started offering such a service long before there
       was a shortage of IPv4 addresses, showing that there are driving forces
       other than the shortage of IPv4 addresses. One approach to CGN deployment
       is described in <xref target="RFC6264"/>.</t>

     <t>This document describes behavior that is required of those
       multi-subscriber NATs for interoperability. It is not an IETF endorsement
       of CGN or a real specification for CGN, but rather just a minimal set of
       requirements that will increase the likelihood of applications working
       across CGNs.</t>

     <t>Because subscribers do not receive unique IPv4 addresses, Carrier Grade
       NATs introduce substantial limitations in communications between
       subscribers and with the rest of the Internet. In particular, it is
       considerably more involved to establish proxy functionality at the border
       between internal and external realms.  Some applications may require
       substantial enhancements, while some others may not function at all in
       such an environment.  Please see "Issues with IP Address Sharing" <xref
         target="RFC6269"/> for details.</t>

     <t>Note that the CGN mechanism described in this document only applies to
       IPv4. Any IPv6 address translation is out of scope.</t>

     <t>This document builds upon previous works describing requirements for
       generic NATs <xref target="RFC4787"/><xref target="RFC5382"/><xref
         target="RFC5508"/>. These documents, and their updates if any, still
       apply in this context. What follows are additional requirements, to be
       satisfied on top of previous ones.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Terminology">

	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
    target="RFC2119" />.</t>

  <t>
    Readers are expected to be familiar with "NAT Behavioral Requirements for
    Unicast UDP" <xref target="RFC4787" /> and the terms defined there. The
    following additional term is used in this document:


    <list style='hanging'>
      <t hangText="Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN):">A NAT-based <xref
          target="RFC2663"/> functional element operated by an administrative
        entity (e.g., operator) to share the same IPv4 address among several
        subscribers. A CGN is managed by the administrative entity, not the
        subscribers.
        <list style="empty">
          <t>Note that the term "carrier-grade" has nothing to do with the
            quality of the NAT; that is left to discretion of implementers.
            Rather, it is to be understood as a topological qualifier: the NAT
            is placed in an ISP's network and translates the traffic of
            potentially many subscribers. Subscribers have limited or no control
            over the CGN, whereas they typically have full control over a NAT
            placed on their premises.</t>
          <t>Note also that the CGN described in this document is IPv4-only.
            IPv6 address translation is not considered.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t><xref target="topology"/> summarizes a common network topology in which a
    CGN operates.</t>

  <t>Another possible topology is one for hotspots, where there is no customer
    premise or customer-premises equipment (CPE), but where a CGN serves a bunch
    of customers who don't trust each other and hence fairness is an issue. One
    important difference with the previous topology is the absence of a second
    layer of NAT. This, however, has no impact on CGN requirements since they
    are driven by fairness and robustness in the service provided to customers,
    which applies in both cases.</t>

<section title="Requirements for CGNs">

	<t>What follows is a list of requirements for CGNs. They are in
    addition to those found in other documents such as <xref target="RFC4787"/>,
    <xref target="RFC5382"/>, and <xref target="RFC5508"/>.</t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>If a CGN forwards packets containing a given transport protocol, then
        it MUST fulfill that transport protocol's behavioral requirements.
        Current applicable documents are as follows:
        <list style="letters">
          <t>"NAT Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP" <xref
              target="RFC4787"/></t>
          <t>"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP" <xref target="RFC5382"/></t>
          <t>"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP" <xref target="RFC5508"/></t>
          <t>"NAT Behavioral Requirements for DCCP" <xref target="RFC5597"/></t>
        </list>
        If NAT behavioral requirements documents are created for additional
        protocols, then these new documents MUST update this list by adding
        themselves to it.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">It is crucial for CGNs to maximize the set of
        applications that can function properly across them.  The IETF has
        documented the best current practices for UDP, TCP, ICMP, and DCCP.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN MUST have a default "IP address pooling" behavior of "Paired"
        (as defined in <xref target="RFC4787"/> section 4.1).  A CGN MAY provide
        a mechanism for administrators to change this behavior on an application
        protocol basis.
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>When multiple overlapping internal IP address ranges share the same
            external IP address pool (e.g., DS-Lite <xref target="RFC6333"/>),
            the "IP address pooling" behavior applies to mappings between
            external IP addresses and internal subscribers rather than between
            external and internal IP addresses.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">This stronger form of REQ-2 from <xref
          target="RFC4787"/> is justified by the stronger need for not breaking
        applications that depend on the external address remaining constant.</t>
      <t>Note that this requirement applies regardless of the transport
        protocol. In other words, a CGN must use the same external IP address
        mapping for all sessions associated with the same internal IP address,
        be they TCP, UDP, ICMP, something else, or a mix of different
        protocols.</t>
      <t>The justification for allowing other behaviors is to allow the
        administrator to save external addresses and ports for application
        protocols that are known to work fine with other behaviors in practice.
        However, the default behavior MUST be "Paired".</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>The CGN function SHOULD NOT have any limitations on the size nor the
        contiguity of the external address pool. In particular, the CGN function
        MUST be configurable with contiguous or non-contiguous external IPv4
        address ranges.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">Given the increasing rarity of IPv4
        addresses, it is becoming harder for an operator to provide large
        contiguous address pools to CGNs. Additionally, operational flexibility
        may require non-contiguous address pools for reasons such as
        differentiated services, routing management, etc.</t>
      <t>The reason for having SHOULD instead of MUST is to account for
        limitations imposed by available resources as well as constraints
        imposed for security reasons.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN MUST support limiting the number of external ports (or,
        equivalently, "identifiers" for ICMP) that are assigned per subscriber.
        <list style="letters">
          <t>Limits MUST be configurable by the CGN administrator.</t>
          <t>Limits MAY be configurable independently per transport
            protocol.</t>
          <t>Additionally, it is RECOMMENDED that the CGN include
            administrator-adjustable thresholds to prevent a single subscriber
            from consuming excessive CPU resources from the CGN (e.g., rate limit
            the subscriber's creation of new mappings).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">A CGN can be considered a network resource
        that is shared by competing subscribers. Limiting the number of external
        ports assigned to each subscriber mitigates the DoS attack that a
        subscriber could launch against other subscribers through the CGN in
        order to get a larger share of the resource. It ensures fairness among
        subscribers. Limiting the rate of allocation mitigates a similar attack
        where the CPU is the resource being targeted instead of port
        numbers, however this requirement is not a MUST because it is very hard
        to explicitly call out all CPU-consuming events.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN SHOULD support limiting the amount of state memory allocated per
        mapping and per subscriber. This may include limiting the number of
        sessions, the number of filters, etc., depending on the NAT
        implementation.
        <list style="letters">
          <t>Limits SHOULD be configurable by the CGN administrator.</t>
          <t>Additionally, it SHOULD be possible to limit the rate at which
            memory-consuming state elements are allocated.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">A NAT needs to keep track of TCP sessions
        associated to each mapping. This state consumes resources for which, in
        the case of a CGN, subscribers may compete. It is necessary to ensure
        that each subscriber has access to a fair share of the CGN's resources.
        Limiting TCP sessions per subscriber and per time unit is an effective
        mitigation against inter-subscriber DoS attacks. Limiting the rate of
        allocation is intended to prevent against CPU resource exhaustion. It
        is at the SHOULD level to account for the fact that means other than
        rate limiting may be used to attain the same goal.</t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>It MUST be possible to administratively turn off translation for
        specific destination addresses and/or ports.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">It is common for a CGN administrator to
        provide access for subscribers to servers installed in the ISP's
        network, in the external realm. When such a server is able to reach the
        internal realm via normal routing (which is entirely controlled by the
        ISP), translation is unneeded. In that case, the CGN may forward packets
        without modification, thus acting like a plain router.  This may
        represent an important efficiency gain.</t>

            constant across state loss, then ports MAY be reused

        state (due to a crash, reboot, failover to a cold standby, etc.). In

      <t hangText="Justification:">This is a slightly different form of REQ-8
        from <xref target="RFC5508"/>. Code 1 is preferred to code 13 because it
        is listed as a "soft error" in <xref target="RFC1122"/>, which is
        important because we don't want TCP stacks to abort the connection
        attempt in this case. See <xref target="RFC5461"/> for details on TCP's
        reaction to soft errors.</t>
      <t>Sending ICMP errors and SNMP traps may be rate-limited for security
        reasons, which is why requirements B and C are SHOULDs, not a MUSTs.</t>
      <t>Applications generally handle connection establishment failure better
        than established connection failure. This is why dropping the packet
        initiating the new connection is preferred over deleting existing
        mappings. See also the rationale in <xref target="RFC5508"/> section
        6.</t>

<section title="Logging">
  <t>It may be necessary for CGN administrators to be able to identify a
    subscriber based on external IPv4 address, port, and timestamp in order to
    deal with abuse. When multiple subscribers share a single external address,
    the source address and port that are visible at the destination host have
    been translated from the ones originated by the subscriber.</t>

  <t>In order to be able to do this, the CGN would need to log the following
    information for each mapping created:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>subscriber identifier (e.g., internal source address or tunnel endpoint
        identifier)</t>
      <t>external source address</t>
      <t>external source port</t>
      <t>timestamp</t>
    </list>
  </t>
  <t>By "subscriber identifier" we mean information that uniquely identifies a
    subscriber. For example, in a traditional NAT scenario, the internal source
    address would be sufficient. In the case of DS-Lite, many subscribers share
    the same internal address and the subscriber identifier is the tunnel
    endpoint identifier (i.e., the B4's IPv6 address).</t>
  <t>A disadvantage of logging mappings is that CGNs under heavy usage may
    produce large amounts of logs, which may require large storage volume.</t>

  <t>
    <list style="format REQ-%d:" counter="Requirements">
      <t>A CGN SHOULD NOT log destination addresses or ports.</t>
    </list>
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Justification:">Destination logging at the CGN creates
        privacy issues. Furthermore, readers should be aware of logging
        recommendations for Internet-facing servers <xref target="RFC6302"/>.
        With compliant servers, the destination address and port do not need to
        be logged by the CGN. This can help reduce the amount of logging.</t>
      <t>This requirement is at the SHOULD level to account for the fact that
        there may be other reasons for logging destination addresses or
        ports.</t>
    </list>
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Bulk Port Allocation">
  <t>So far we have assumed that a CGN allocates one external port for every
    outgoing connection. In this section, the impacts of allocating multiple
    external ports at a time are discussed.</t>
  <t>There is a range of things a CGN can do:
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Traditional:">For every outgoing connection, allocate one
        external port.</t>
      <t hangText="Scattered port set:">For an outgoing connection, create a set
        of several non-consecutive external ports. Subsequent outgoing
        connections will use ports from the set.  When the set is exhausted, a
        new connection causes a new set to be created.  A set is smaller or
        equal to the user's maximum port limit.</t>
      <t hangText="Consecutive port set:">Same as the scattered port set, but
        the ports allocated to a set are consecutive.</t>
    </list>
  </t>
  <t>Note that this list is not exhaustive. There is a continuum of behavior
    that a CGN may choose to implement. For example, a CGN could use scattered
    port sets of consecutive port sets.</t>

  <t>The impacts of bulk port allocation are as follows.
    <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Port Utilization:">The mechanisms at the top of the list are
        very efficient in their port utilization.  In that sense, they have good
        scaling properties (nothing is wasted).  The mechanisms at the bottom of
        the list will waste ports.  The number of wasted ports is proportional
        to size of the "bin".</t>

      <t hangText="Logging:">Traditional allocation creates a lot of log entries
        as compared to allocation by port sets which creates much fewer entries.
        Scattered and consecutive port sets generate the same number of log
        entries. In the case of consecutive port sets, entries can be expressed
        very compactly by indicating a range (e.g.,  "12000-12009"). Some
        scattered port set allocation schemes can also generate small log
        entries containing the parameters and algorithm used for the port set
        generation (see, e.g., <xref target="RFC6431"/>).</t>
      <t>With large set sizes, the logging frequency for scattered and
        consecutive port sets can approach that of DHCP servers.</t>
      <t hangText="Security:">Traditional and scattered port sets provide very
        good security in that ports numbers are not easily guessed.  Easily
        guessed port numbers put subscribers at risk of the attacks described in
        <xref target="RFC6056"/>.  Consecutive port sets provides poor security
        to subscribers, especially if the set size is small.</t>
    </list>
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Deployment Considerations">
  <t>Several issues are encountered when CGNs are used <xref
      target="RFC6269"/>. There is current
    work in the IETF toward alleviating some of these issues. For example, see
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis"/>.</t>
</section>

   <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
     <t>There are no IANA considerations.</t>
   </section>
	
   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
     <t>If a malicious subscriber can spoof another subscriber's CPE, it may
       cause a DoS to that subscriber by creating mappings up to the allowed
       limit. An ISP can prevent this with ingress filtering, as described in
       <xref target="RFC2827"/>.</t>
     <t>This document recommends Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) as the
       default filtering behavior for CGNs. EIF has security considerations
       which are discussed in <xref target="RFC4787"/>.</t>
     <t>NATs sometimes perform fragment reassembly. CGNs would do so at
       presumably high data rates. Therefore, the reader should be familiar with
       the potential security issues described in <xref target="RFC4963"/>.</t>
