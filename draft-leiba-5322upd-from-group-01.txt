Abstract

   The Internet Message Format (RFC 5322) allows "group" syntax in some
   email header fields, such as "To:" and "CC:", but not in "From:".
   This document updates RFC 5322 to relax that restriction, allowing
   group syntax in "From:".

Internet-Draft        Group Syntax in Email 'From:'            July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Message Format [RFC5322] allows "group" syntax in some
   email header fields, such as "To:" and "CC:", but not in "From:".  As
   use cases for group syntax evolve, particularly with respect to email
   address internationalization issues, it is becoming clear that there
   is little value in forbidding that usage, and significant value in
   allowing it.  This document updates RFC 5322 to relax that
   restriction, allowing group syntax in "From:".

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The notational conventions here are the same as those in RFC 5322,
   and the following two subsections are copied directly from that
   document.

1.1.1.  Requirements Notation

   This document occasionally uses terms that appear in capital letters.
   When the terms "MUST", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD
   NOT", and "MAY" appear capitalized, they are being used to indicate
   particular requirements of this specification.  A discussion of the
   meanings of these terms appears in [RFC2119].

1.1.2.  Syntactic Notation

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation for the formal definitions of the syntax of
   messages.  Characters will be specified either by a decimal value
   (e.g., the value %d65 for uppercase A and %d97 for lowercase A) or by
   a case-insensitive literal value enclosed in quotation marks (e.g.,
   "A" for either uppercase or lowercase A).


2.  Allowing Group Syntax in 'From'

   Section 3.6.2 of RFC 5322 defines the "From:" header field as
   containing a "mailbox-list" syntax element.  This changes that
   definition to use the "address-list" syntax element, as is used in
   other fields, such as "To:", "CC:", and "Reply-To:".

   The following normative section replaces Section 3.6.2 of RFC 5322.

2.1.  Replacement of RFC 5322, Section 3.6.2. Originator Fields

   The originator fields of a message consist of the from field, the
   sender field (when applicable), and optionally the reply-to field.
   The from field consists of the field name "From" and a comma-

   separated list of one or more addresses (either mailbox or group
   syntax).

   [[anchor5: *** This next sentence needs to be fixed. ***]]
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   If the from field contains more than one address in the address-list,
   then the sender field, containing the field name "Sender" and a
   single mailbox specification, MUST appear in the message.
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   In either case, an optional reply-to field MAY also be included,
   which contains the field name "Reply-To" and a comma-separated list
   of one or more addresses (either mailbox or group syntax).

   from = "From:" address-list CRLF

   sender = "Sender:" mailbox CRLF

   reply-to = "Reply-To:" address-list CRLF

   The originator fields indicate the address(es) of the source of the
   message.  The "From:" field specifies the author(s) of the message,
   that is, the address(es) of the person(s) or system(s) responsible
   for the writing of the message.  The "Sender:" field specifies the
   mailbox of the agent responsible for the actual transmission of the
   message.  For example, if a secretary were to send a message for
   another person, the mailbox of the secretary would appear in the
   "Sender:" field and the address of the actual author would appear in
   the "From:" field.  If the originator of the message can be indicated
   by a single mailbox in the "From:" field and the author and
   transmitter are identical, the "Sender:" field SHOULD NOT be used.
   Otherwise, both fields SHOULD appear.

      Note: The transmitter information is always present.  The absence
      of the "Sender:" field is sometimes mistakenly taken to mean that
      the agent responsible for transmission of the message has not been
      specified.  This absence merely means that the transmitter is
      identical to the author and is therefore not redundantly placed
      into the "Sender:" field.

   The originator fields also provide the information required when
   replying to a message.  When the "Reply-To:" field is present, it
   indicates the address(es) to which the author of the message suggests
   that replies be sent.  In the absence of the "Reply-To:" field,
   replies SHOULD by default be sent to the address(es) specified in the
   "From:" field unless otherwise specified by the person composing the
   reply.

   In all cases, the "From:" field SHOULD NOT contain any address that
   does not belong to the author(s) of the message.  See also [RFC5322]
   Section 3.6.3 for more information on forming the destination
   addresses for a reply.


3.  Security Considerations

   See the Internet Message Format specification [RFC5322] for general
   discussion of security considerations related to the formatting of
   email messages.

   The "From" address is special, in that most user agents display that
   address, or the "friendly" text associated with it, to the end user,
   and label that so as to identify it as the origin of the message (as
   implied in Section 3.6.2 of RFC 5322).  Group syntax in the "From"
   header field can be used to hide the identity of the message
   originator.  It is as easy to use a fabricated "From" address to
   accomplish the same thing, so allowing group syntax does not
   exacerbate the problem.

   Some protocols attempt to validate that originator address by
   matching the "From" address to a particular verified domain (see
   Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP) [RFC5617] for one such
   protocol).  Such protocols will not be applicable to messages that
   lack an actual email address (whether real or fake) in the "From"
   field, and local policy will determine how such messages are handled.
   Senders, therefore, need to be aware that using group syntax in the
   "From" might adversely affect deliverability of the message.


4.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are requested by this document, and the RFC Editor is
   asked to remove this section before publication.
