Internet-Draft    NVo3 Control Plane Protocol Using IS-IS   October 2012 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   [NVo3-PS] discusses the need of an overlay-based network 
   virtualization approach, referred to as Network Virtualization over 
   Layer3 (NVo3), for providing multi-tenancy capabilities in large 
   data centers networks and outlines the needs for a control plane 
   protocol to facilitate running these NVo3 overlay networks. 

   [NVo3-FW] provides a framework for NVo3 overlay networks and 
   meanwhile describes the needs for a control plane protocol to 
   provide the following capabilities such as auto-provisioning/service 
   discovery, address mapping advertisement and tunnel management. 

   [NVo3-CP] outlines the high-level requirements of the control plane 
   protocol(s) for NVo3 overlay networks.  

   IS-IS protocol [IS-IS] is a much proven and well-known routing 
   protocol which has been widely deployed in many large carrier 
   networks and data center networks for decades of years. Due to its 
   extendibility, IS-IS protocol now is not only used for propagating 
   IP reachability information in Layer3 networks (see [RFC1195]), but 
   also used for propagating MAC reachability information in Layer2 
   networks or Layer2 overlay networks(see [RFC6165]).  

   This document accordingly proposes using IS-IS as a common control 
   plane protocol of NVo3 overlay networks which can be workable with 
   any specific NVo3 overlay encapsulation formats including Layer2 
   overlay encapsulation formats as well as Layer3 overlay 
   encapsulation formats.  

   It's no doubt that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is more scalable 
   than IS-IS and hence the former is more suitable to be used as a 
   common NVo3 control plane in large data center network environments. 
   However, for some small and even medium sized data center networks, 
   the complexity of BGP is perhaps too much and even unaffordable. IS-
   IS -based common NVo3 control plane could be an alternative choice 
   for these small and even medium data center networks where 
   automating and simplifying the network provisioning is particularly 
   important. 

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [NVo3-FW], [RFC4664], 
   and [RFC4364].

3. Control Plane 

 3.1. VN Membership Auto-discovery 

   One of the requirements of the NVo3 overlay control plane protocol 
   outlined in [NVo3-CP] is: "Do not rely on IP Multicast in the 
   Underlying Network". As such, the control plane protocol SHOULD at 
   least have the capability of VN membership auto-discovery. By 
   propagating the following VN Info TLVs among Network Virtualization 
   Edges (NVEs) (i.e., PE routers in the context of L2VPN [RFC4761, 
   RFC4762] or L3VPN [RFC4364] technologies), NVEs belonging to the 
   same VN instance could discover one another automatically. Note that 
   this TLV is applicable to both Layer2 and Layer3 overlay cases.

           Total number of bytes contained in the value field. 

       Originating NVE's IP Address  

           This 128-bit field is filled with one of the originating 
           NVE's IPv4 or IPv6 addresses which are reachable across the 
           IP backbone. The address filled in this field SHOULD be used 
           as a tunnel destination address by remote NVEs when these 
           NVEs acting as NVEs want to tunnel a customer Ethernet frame 
           or IP packet to such NVE. If the IP address is IPv4, the 
           last four octets of this field are filled with the IPv4 
           address while the remaining part is set to zero. In other 
           words, it is filled with an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. 

       VN ID  

           This field is filled with a 24-bit globally significant VN 
           ID for a particular attached VN instance.   

       Local MPLS Label 

           This field is filled with a locally significant MPLS label 
           associated with the VN ID. This field is only meaningful in 
           the case where MPLS labels are contained in the NVo3 
           encapsulated packets and are used for identifying specific 
           VN instances that the encapsulated packets belong to. 
           Otherwise, this field MUST be set to zero. 

 3.2. Encapsulation Capability Advertisement 

   To reach a consensus on what specific encapsulation format to be 
   used between ingress and egress NVE pairs, egress NVEs SHOULD 
   advertise their own encapsulation capabilities automatically by 
   using the following Encapsulation Type TLV. In other words, egress 
   NVEs SHOULD notice ingress NVEs of what specific encapsulation 
   format(s) they can support. Note that this TLV is applicable to both 
   Layer2 and Layer3 overlay cases.

       Value   

           This field is filled with the detailed encapsulation 
           requirements specific to a given encapsulation format. If 
           there is no further encapsulation requirement, this field 
           could be zero in length. More details are to be defined in 
           the future version of this document.  

 3.3. Tunnel Address Prefix Advertisement 

   To facilitate the load-balancing of encapsulated NVo3 overlay 
   traffic in the IP core of the underlying networks in some cases, 
   it'd better for distinct traffic flows between a given tunnel 
   endpoint pair (i.e., an ingress and egress NVE pair) to be 
   encapsulated with tunnel headers of as many different tunnel 
   destination addresses as possible. To achieve this goal, egress NVEs 
   could notice ingress NVEs of multiple tunnel endpoint addresses for 
   encapsulation in the form of an IP address prefix.  

   If more than one IP address prefix needs to be advertised, multiple 
   such TLVs can be carried in a LSP. Note that this TLV is applicable 
   to both Layer2 and Layer3 overlay cases. 

    3.3.1. Tunnel Address Prefix TLV 

          0                   1                   2                   3

           Total number of bytes contained in the value field. If the 
           tunnel address prefix is an IPv4 one, the Length value is 
           set to 8, and if the tunnel address prefix is an IPv6 one, 
           the Length value is set to 32.

           This field is filled with a two tuple <subnet address,

 3.4. Layer2 NV Multi-homing 

   Taking the scenario shown in Figure 1 as an example, a physical 
   Ethernet switch or a virtual switch embedded on a physical server is 
   dual-homed to two NVEs, NVE-1 and NVE-2. The dual-homed device is 
   referred to as a DHD. These two NVEs form one or more redundancy 
   groups (RG) with each providing a given VLAN on the DHD a reliable 
   connectivity to the corresponding NV overlay(s) on the NVEs. For 
   example, the DHD is configured with two VLANs which are attached to 
   two NV instances respectively. These two NVEs would therefore form 
   two separate RGs with each for a given VLAN or VN instance. These 
   NVEs uses the following Layer2 VN Multi-homing TLV to automatically 
   elect the one among them as the designated forwarder (DF) on the per 
   RG basis. The DF SHOULD keep its attachment circuit to the multi-
   homed DHD in forwarding status while all the other NVEs of that RG 
   that are not elected as the DF MUST keep their attachment circuits 
   to the multi-homed DHD in non-forwarding status. To achieve a better 
   load-balance among these two NVEs, NVE-1 could be elected as a DF 
   for some RGs associated with the DHD, while NVE-2 could be elected 
   as a DF for the remaining RGs associated with the same DHD.

       DHD ID  

           This field is filled with a 7-byte unsigned integer value 
           which represents the DHD. 

    3.4.2. DF Election Procedure 

   Among a set of NVEs which are connected to a given DHD, the one with 
   the highest priority would be elected to be the DF. The originating 
   NVE's IP address would be resorted for tie breaking in case more 
   than one NVE is configured with the same highest priority. 

    3.4.3. MAC Withdrawn in the Active/standby Failover 

   In the case where the DF ceases the DF role due to some reason, e.g., 
   the DF loses the connectivity to the multi-homed CE device or 
   operators proactively triggers the DF switchover by decreasing the 
   priority of the current DF, remote PE routers SHOULD flush all MAC 
   addresses learnt against it. In the control-plane based MAC-learning 
   mode, the former DF would withdraw the affected MAC reachability 
   info which has been advertised before. In the data-plane based MAC-
   learning mode, the former DF would withdraw the affected VPLS info 
   that has been advertised before and thus remote PE routers could 
   flush all MAC addresses which are within the affected VPLS instance 
   and learnt against the former DF upon receiving the VPLS info 
   withdrawal announcement. The side-effect of such operation is that 
   those MAC addresses which are leant against the former DF but not 
   actually learnt from the affected CE device would also be flushed 
   unnecessarily since remote PE routers have no way to distinguish 
   which MAC addresses are learnt from the affected CE device and which 
   not. 

 3.5. MAC Reachability Info Advertisement 

   For those Layer2 overlay approaches which adopts the control-plane 
   based MAC address learning mechanism, MAC reachability information 
   of a given VN instance would be exchanged across NVEs of that VN 
   instance. 

   Upon learning MAC addresses of their local TES's somehow, NVEs 
   SHOULD immediately advertise these MAC addresses to remote NVEs of 
   the same VN instance by using the MAC-Reachability TLV defined in 
   [RFC6165]. One or more MAC-Reachability TLVs are carried in a LSP 
   which in turn is encapsulated with an Ethernet header. The source 
   MAC address is the originating NVE's MAC address whereas the 
   destination MAC address is a to-be-defined multicast MAC address 
   specifically identifying all NVEs. Such Ethernet frames containing

Internet-Draft    NVo3 Control Plane Protocol Using IS-IS   October 2012 
 
   IS-IS LSPs are forwarded towards remote NVEs as if they were 
   customer multicast Ethernet frames. Egress NVEs receiving the above 
   frames SHOULD intercept them and accordingly process them. IP 
   address of the NVE originating these MAC routes could be derived 
   either from the "IP Interface Address" field contained in the 
   corresponding LSPs (Note that the IP address here SHOULD be 
   identical with that contained in the VN Info TLV) or from the tunnel 
   source IP address of the NVo3 encapsulated packet containing such 
   MAC routes. 

   Since these LSPs are fully transparent to core routers of the 
   underlying networks (i.e., non-NVE routers), there is no impact on 
   the control plane of core routers at all. More details about the 
   control-plane based MAC learning procedure are for further study. 

 3.6. IP Reachability Info Advertisement 

   For those Layer3 overlay approaches, IP reachability information of 
   a given VN instance, including both host routes and subnet routes, 
   SHOULD be exchanged across NVEs of that VN instance. The IP-
   Reachability TLV defined in [RFC1195] could be used directly here. 

   One or more IP-Reachability TLVs are carried in a LSP which in turn 
   is encapsulated with an Ethernet header. The source MAC address is 
   the originating NVE's MAC address whereas the destination MAC 
   address is a to-be-defined multicast MAC address specifically 
   identifying all NVEs. Such Ethernet frames containing IS-IS LSPs are 
   forwarded towards remote NVEs as if they were customer multicast 
   Ethernet frames. Egress NVEs receiving the above frames SHOULD 
   intercept them and accordingly process them.  

   Similarly, since these LSPs are fully transparent to core routers of 
   the underlying networks (i.e., non-NVE routers), there is no impact 
   on the control plane of core routers at all. 

4. Security Considerations 

   This document doesn't introduce additional security risk to IS-IS, 
   nor does it provide any additional security feature for IS-IS. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   Several IS-IS TLV type codes as mentioned above are required to be 
   allocated by IANA.
