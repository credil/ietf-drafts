                   Route Leaks -- Proposed Solutions
                 draft-dickson-sidr-route-leak-solns-01

Abstract

   The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the means to
   advertise reachability for IP prefixes.  This reachability
   information is propagated in a peer-to-peer topology.  Sometimes
   routes are announced to peers for which the local peering policy does
   not permit.  And sometimes routes are propagated indiscriminantly,
   once they have been accepted.

   This document considers the situations that can lead to routes being
   leaked, and tries to find acceptable definitions for describing these
   scenarios.

   The purpose of these definitions is to facilitate discussion on what
   a route leak is, and what the scope of the problem space for route
   leaks is.  This, in turn, is intended to inform a requirements
   document for detection of (and prevention of) route leaks.  And
   finally, the definitions and requirements are intended to allow
   proposed solutions which meet these criteria, and to facilitate
   evaluation of proposed solutions.

   The fundamental objective is to "solve the route leaks problem".

Internet-Draft      Route Leaks - Proposed Solutions          March 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Rationale

   This document describes two different schemes for implementing a
   solution for route leaks.

   They represent different trade-offs between simplicity of
   implementation, versus embedding information.  The information
   embedded can be inferred currently from a variety of sources, so the
   risk/cost of doing so is marginal.

   Either solution would be adequate to solve the route leak problem.

   Due to the requirement for mandatory establishment of peering link
   types, and cryptographic protection, the ideal time and place to
   implement this would be coincident with BGPSEC.

   Including route leak protection with BGPSEC may be beneficial to the
   latter.  It is more compelling to deploy a solution to both sets of
   problems, than to deploy a solution to one or the other alone.

1.2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the IETF.


2.  Prefix Attribute Possibilities

   If we presume that there are two possible colors for a prefix, then
   we have three ways to express those colors:

   1.  A single bit, with two possible values, always attached to a
       prefix.

   2.  An attribute whose presence signals one of the colors, and whose
       absence signals the other color.

   3.  The same as 2, but with the other color being signaled.

   For sake of clarity, we will use a fairly universally understood pair
   of colors, "green" (meaning "proceed"), and "yellow" (meaning

   "caution").

   So, the three ways of marking the colors are:

      Use a green/yellow bit (green if 1, yellow if 0)

      Use a "green" attribute (green if present, yellow otherwise)

      Use a "yellow" attribute (yellow if present, green otherwise).

   Since information is leaked for both the "green/yellow bit" and
   "yellow attribute", there is no reason to discuss the "yellow
   attribute" option.  It is inferior to both other methods.


3.  Encoding Color via Choice of Algorithm

   Here, we are presuming that BGPSEC is in use on prefixes, and that
   BGPSEC includes an explicit algorithm identifier.  Currently, the
   identifier only specifies which algorithm to use to validate the
   signature in the signature block.

   This would be augmented so that for any given algorithm, two
   identifiers would be assigned.  One would be the identifier
   signifying "Green", and the other would signify "Yellow".  When
   sending a "green" route, the current "green" algorithm would be used.
   When sending a "yellow" route, the current "yellow" algorithm would
   be used.  Validation would work as usual, with the additional ability
   to validate the color rules for preventing route leaks.

   No additional changes to the structure of the BGPSEC protocol or wire
   format are needed.

   However, there is the leak of information about transit
   relationships, which is unavoidable with this design.

   Routes which violate the path coloring rules but otherwise validate,
   would be blocked.  (They should not occur, but should be checked
   regardless.)  Routes which do not validate under BGPSEC would be
   blocked regardless, also preventing a potential source of route
   leaks.


4.  Encoding Color via a Second Signature Block

   A signature block analogous to the AS-PATH signature block, would be
   included on any announcement that is "green".  The local sender would
   add her signature to the signature block on these "green"



Dickson                 Expires September 7, 2012               [Page 5]

   announcements.  In addition, the new signature block would be sent
   across the "green/yellow" boundary to any Peer.  However, when
   sending across the "green/yellow" boundary, would not add her
   signature to the block.

   The recipient would be able to validate all the "green" signatures up
   to the sender, and if present, the sender's signature as well.  If
   the "green" signature does not include the sender, no more signatures
   can be attached.  When sending to a "yellow" peer, the "green
   attribute" block is stripped (if present).  The absence of a "green
   block" means the prefix is considered "yellow".  This mechanism is
   not "free" in that more crypto calculations are needed, the structure
   of the BGPSEC attributes change, and more data is needed on each
   announcement within the "green" zone.

   However, no information concerning relationships is leaked, beyond
   what the recipient can already infer.  A transit provider already
   knows his/her customers, and their customers, etc.

   From a scaling perspective, it should be noted that only customers'
   prefixes require additional signatures, so the number of prefixes
   with those signatures is proportionally smaller.  Signature
   validation is only done on the "green block" upon receiving a
   customer's routes or a peer's routes.  This also minimizes the
   incremental cost.

   Since it is physically impossible to promote a "yellow" route to a
   "green" route, because the originators "green" block is absent, this
   is a very strong mechanism for stopping route leaks.  Validating link
   type versus color, after validation of any "green block" present, is
   sufficient to stop route leaks.
