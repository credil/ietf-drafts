Abstract

   This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Via header field parameter, "rkeep".  The "rkeep" parameter allows a
   SIP entity to indicate willingness to receive keep-alives from its
   adjacent downstream SIP entity, the adjacent downstream SIP entity to
   indicate willingness to send keep-alives, and for SIP entities
   willing to send keep-alives to inform the receiver about the keep-
   alive frequency.

Internet-Draft             reverse keep-alive                  June 2012


1.  Introduction

   RFC 6263 [RFC6263] defines a mechanism, which allows adjacent SIP
   entities to explicitly negotiate usage of the NAT keep-alive
   mechanisms defined in SIP Outbound [RFC5626].  The "keep" parameter
   [RFC6263] allows SIP entities, when sending a request, to indicate
   willingness to send keep-alives, and it allows SIP entities, when
   sending a response, indicate willingness to receive keep-alives.

   In some cases a SIP device, located behind a NAT, is not able to send
   keep-alives.  One reason can be that the scheduling policy of the
   operating system used by the SIP device does not meet the requirement
   for sending keep-alives using a proper frequency, meaning that NAT
   bindings might not be kept.  In such cases, the device needs to
   request another device to send keep-alives towards the itself.  Then,
   the keep-alive response message sent from the SIP device will ensure
   that the NAT binding is kept open.

   This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Via header field parameter [RFC3261], "rkeep".  The "rkeep" parameter
   allows a SIP entity to indicate willingness to receive keep-alives
   from its adjacent downstream SIP entity, the adjacent downstream SIP
   entity to indicate willingness to send keep-alives, and for SIP
   entities willing to send keep-alives to inform the receiver about the
   keep-alive frequency.

   The following sections describe use-cases where a mechanism to
   explicitly negotiate usage of keep-alives is needed.

1.1.  Use-case: UA not able to send keep-alives due to sleep mode


2.  Applicability

   The mechanism defined in this specification MUST only be used by SIP
   entities that are not able, e.g. because the scheduling policy of the
   operating system used by the SIP device does not meet the requirement
   for sending keep-alives using a proper frequency.


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

4.  Definitions

   Keep-alives: The keep-alive messages defined in RFC 5626.

   "rkeep" parameter: A SIP Via header field parameter that a SIP entity
   can insert in the topmost Via header field that it adds to the
   request, to explicitly indicate willingness to receive keep-alives
   from its adjacent downstream SIP entity.  A SIP entity can add a
   parameter value to the "rkeep" parameter, or remove an existing
   parameter value, in a response to explicitly indicate willingness to
   send keep-alives to its adjacent upstream SIP entity.

   SIP entity: SIP User Agent (UA), or proxy, as defined in RFC 3261.

   Adjacent downstream SIP entity: The adjacent SIP entity in the
   direction towards which a SIP request is sent.

   Adjacent upstream SIP entity: The adjacent SIP entity in the
   direction from which a SIP request is received.


5.  User Agent and Proxy behavior

5.1.  General

   This section describes how SIP UAs and proxies negotiate usage of
   keep-alives associated with a registration, or a dialog, which types
   of SIP requests can be used in order to negotiate the usage, and the
   lifetime of the negotiated keep-alives.

   SIP entities indicate willingness to receive keep-alives from the
   adjacent downstream SIP entity using SIP requests.  The associated
   responses are used by SIP entities to indicate willingness to send
   keep-alives.  Both SIP entities can indicate a recommended keep-alive
   frequency.

   The procedures to negotiate usage of keep-alives are identical for
   SIP UAs and proxies.

   NOTE: Usage of keep-alives is negotiated per direction.  If a SIP
   entity has indicated willingness to receive keep-alives from an
   adjacent SIP entity, sending of keep-alives towards that adjacent SIP
   entity needs to be separately negotiated.

5.2.  Lifetime of keep-alives

   The lifetime of negotiated keep-alives depends on whether the keep-
   alives are associated with a registration or a dialog.  The rules

Internet-Draft             reverse keep-alive                  June 2012


   defined in RFC 6223 [RFC6223] also apply when keep-alives are
   negotiated using the 'rkeep' Via header field parameter.

5.3.  Behavior of a SIP entity willing to receive keep-alives

   As defined in RFC 5626, a SIP entity that supports receiving of keep-
   alives must act as a STUN server [RFC5389].  The SIP entity must
   support those aspects of STUN that are required in order to apply the
   STUN keep-alive mechanism defined in RFC 5626, and it must support
   the CRLF keep-alive mechanism defined in RFC 5626.

   When a SIP entity sends or forwards a request, if it wants to
   negotiate the receiving of keep-alives associated with a
   registration, or a dialog, it MUST insert a "rkeep" parameter in the
   topmost Via header field that it adds to the request, to indicate
   willingness to receive keep-alives.  The SIP entity MAY add a
   parameter value to the "rkeep" parameter before sending or forwarding
   the request.  The parameter value, if present and with a value other
   than zero, represents a recommended keep-alive frequency, given in
   seconds.

   When the SIP entity receives the associated response, if the "rkeep"
   parameter in the topmost Via header field of the response contains a
   "rkeep" parameter value with a non-zero value, or a value which is
   different from the value sent in the request (counting a "rkeep"
   parameter without a value) it MUST be prepared to start receiving
   keep-alives from the same destination from where it received the
   response which was used to negotiate the receiving of keep-alives.
   If the "rkeep" parameter does not contain a value, the SIP entity
   MUST assume that keep-alives will be sent using the recommended keep-
   alive frequency, if any, that the SIP entity added to the associated
   request.

   If the associated response contains the same "rkeep" parameter value
   as the request (counting a "rkeep" parameter without a value), the
   SIP entity MUST assume that keep-alives will not be sent.

   Once a SIP entity has negotiated receiving of keep-alives associated
   with a dialog towards an adjacent SIP entity, it MUST NOT insert a
   "rkeep" parameter in any subsequent SIP requests, associated with the
   dialog, towards that adjacent SIP entity.  Such "rkeep" parameter
   MUST be ignored, if received.

   Since an ACK request does not have an associated response, it can not
   be used to negotiate usage of keep-alives.  Therefore, a SIP entity
   MUST NOT insert a "rkeep" parameter in the topmost Via header field
   of an ACK request.  Such "rkeep" parameter MUST be ignored, if
   received.

   A SIP entity MUST NOT indicates willingness to receive keep-alives
   associated with a dialog, unless it has also inserted itself in the
   dialog route set [RFC3261].

   If an INVITE request is used to indicate willingness to receive keep-
   alives, as long as at least one response (provisional or final) to
   the INVITE request contains a "rkeep" parameter with a parameter
   value which is different from the value in the request (counting a
   "rkeep" parameter without a value) it is seen as an indication that
   the adjacent downstream SIP entity is willing to send keep-alives
   associated with the dialog on which the response is received.

5.4.  Behavior of a SIP entity willing to send keep-alives

   As defined in RFC 5626, a SIP entity that supports sending of keep-
   alives must act as a Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)
   client [RFC5389].  The SIP entity must support those aspects of STUN
   that are required in order to apply the STUN keep-alive mechanism
   defined in RFC 5626, and it must support the CRLF keep-alive
   mechanism defined in RFC 5626.  RFC 5626 defines when to use STUN,
   respectively double-CRLF, for keep-alives.

   When a SIP entity sends or forwards a response, and the adjacent
   upstream SIP entity indicated willingness to receive keep-alives
   without a recommended keep-alive frequency, if the SIP entity is
   willing to send keep-alives associated with the registration, or the
   dialog, to the adjacent upstream SIP entity it MUST add a parameter
   value to the "rkeep" parameter, before sending or forwarding the
   response.  The parameter value, represents the keep-alive frequency,
   given in seconds, that the sender of the keep-alives will use.

   If the adjacent upstream SIP entity provided a recommended keep-alive
   frequency, and if the SIP entity is willing to send keep-alives using
   that frequency, it MUST remove the "rkeep" parameter value which
   indicates the recommended keep-alive frequency, before sending or
   forwarding the response.

   NOTE: The reason for removing the "rkeep" parameter value is to
   indicate that the SIP entity supports the mechanism, and simply does
   not forward an unknown parameter.

   If the adjacent upstream SIP entity provided a recommended keep-alive
   frequency, and if the SIP entity is willing to send keep-alives using
   a different frequency, it MUST modify the "rkeep" parameter value
   which indicates the recommended keep-alive frequency, before sending
   or forwarding the response.

   There might be multiple responses to an INVITE request.  When a SIP

Internet-Draft             reverse keep-alive                  June 2012


   entity indicates willingness to send keep-alives in a response to an
   INVITE request, it MUST add a parameter value to the "rkeep"
   parameter in at least one reliable response to the request.  The SIP
   entity MAY add identical parameter values to the "rkeep" parameters
   in other responses to the same request.  The SIP entity MUST NOT add
   different parameter value to the "rkeep" parameters in responses to
   the same request.  The SIP entity SHOULD indicate the willingness to
   send keep-alives as soon as possible.

   A SIP entity MUST NOT indicates willingness to send keep-alives
   associated with a dialog, unless it has also inserted itself in the
   dialog route set [RFC3261].

   When the SIP entity has indicated willingness to send keep-alives, it
   MUST start sending keep-alives towards the same destination where it
   sent the response used to indicate willingness to send keep-alives.


6.  Keep-alive frequency

   If a SIP entity sends a SIP response, where the topmost Via header
   field contains a "rkeep" parameter with a non-zero value that
   indicates the keep-alive frequency, given in seconds, it MUST use the
   procedures defined for the Flow-Timer header field [RFC5626].
   According to the procedures, the SIP entity must send keep-alives at
   least as often as the indicated keep-alive frequency, and if the SIP
   entity uses the indicated keep-alive frequency then it should send
   its keep-alives so that the interval between each keep-alive is
   randomly distributed between 80% and 100% of the indicated keep-alive
   frequency.

   This specification does not define any semantic for a "rkeep" Via
   header parameter value with a zero value.  A SIP entity MUST NOT
   insert a zero value to a "rkeep" parameter.  A SIP entity that
   receives a "rkeep" parameter with a zero value SHOULD NOT assume that
   the sender of the response will send keep-alives towards the SIP
   entity.

   This specification does not specify actions to take if negotiated
   keep-alives are not received.  As defined in RFC 5626, the receiving
   SIP entity may consider a connection to be dead in such situations.

   NOTE: The Flow-Timer header field [RFC5626] has no impact on keep-
   alives negotiated using the "rkeep" Via header field parameter.
