   One of the major advantages in SCTP is supporting multi-homing communication. 
   If a multi-homed end-point has redundant network connections, SCTP sessions can 
   have a good chance to survive from network failures by migrating inactive 
   network to active one. 
   However, if we follow the SCTP standard, there can be significant delay for the
   network migration. During this migration period, SCTP cannot transmit much data to the 
   destination. This issue drastically impairs the usability of SCTP in some situations. 
   This memo describes the issue of SCTP failover mechanism and discuss its solutions 
   which require minimal modification to the current standard.

<section title="Introduction">
          <t>
    The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"/>
    natively supports multihoming at the transport layer --  
    an SCTP association can bind 
    to multiple IP addresses at each endpoint. SCTP's multihoming features include 
    failure detection and failover procedures to provide network interface redundancy 
    and improved end-to-end fault tolerance.
   </t>
   
    <t> In SCTP's current failure detection procedure, the sender must 
    experience Path.Max.Retrans (PMR) number of consecutive
   timeouts on a destination before detecting path failure. The sender fails over
   to an alternate active destination only after failure detection.
   Until failover, the sender 
   transmits data on the failed path, degrading SCTP performance.
   Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT) <xref target="IYENGAR06" /> is an extension to SCTP 
   and allows the sender to transmit data on multiple paths simultaneously. Research 
   <xref target="NATARAJAN09" /> shows that the current failure detection procedure
   worsens CMT performance during failover and 
   can be significantly improved by employing a better failover algorithm. </t>
   <t> This document proposes an alternative failure detection procedure for SCTP (and CMT)
   that improves SCTP (CMT) performance during failover.

<section title="Issue in SCTP Path Management Process">
          <t>
   SCTP can utilize multiple IP addresses for a single SCTP association.
   Each SCTP endpoint exchanges the list of available addresses on the node during initial 
   negotiation. After this, endpoints select one address from the list and define this 
   as the primary destination. During normal transmission, SCTP sends all data to the primary destination. 
   Also, it sends heartbeat packets to other 
   (non-primary) destinations at a certain interval to check the reachability of the path. 
  </t><t>
   If sender has multiple active destination addresses, it can retransmit data to 
   secondary destination address when the transmission to the primary times out.
  </t><t>
   When sender receives the acknowledgment for data or heartbeat packets from one of the
   destination addresses, it considers the destination is active. If it fails to receive
   acknowledgments, the error count for the address is increased. 
   If the error counter exceeds the protocol parameter 'Path.Max.Retrans', SCTP endpoint 
   considers the address is inactive.
  </t><t>
   The failover process of SCTP is initiated when the primary path becomes inactive 
   (error counter for the primary path exceeds Path.Max.Retrans). If the primary path is 
   marked inactive, SCTP chooses new destination address from one of the active destinations 
   and start using this address to send data.
   If the primary path becomes active again, SCTP uses the primary destination for subsequent 
   data transmissions and stop using non-primary one.
  </t><t>

   An issue in this failover process is that it usually takes significant amount of time
   before SCTP switches to the new destination. Let's say the primary path on a multi-homed
   host becomes unavailable and the RTO value for the primary path at that time is around 1 
   second, it usually takes over 60 seconds before SCTP starts to use the secondary path.
   This is because the recommended value for Path.Max.Retrans in the standard is 5, 
   which requires 6 consecutive timeouts before failover takes place.
   Before SCTP switches to the secondary address, SCTP keeps trying to send packets to 
   the primary and only retransmitted packets are sent to the secondary can be reached 
   at the receiver.
   This slow failover process can cause significant performance degradation and 
   will not be acceptable in some situations.
   </t>
</section>

<section title="Existing Solutions for Smooth Failover">
   <t>
   The following approach are conceivable for the solutions of this issue.
   </t>
<section title="Reduce Path.Max.Retrans">
   <t>
   If we choose smaller value for Path.Max.Retrans, we can shorten the duration of failover 
   process. In fact, this is recommended in some research results
   	<xref target="JUNGMAIER02"/>
   	<xref target="GRINNEMO04"/>
   	<xref target="FALLON08"/>.
   For example, if we set Path.Max.Retrans to 0, SCTP switches to another destination on a 
   single timeout. However, smaller value for Path.Max.Retrans might cause spurious failover. 
   In addition, if we use smaller value for Path.Max.Retrans, we may also need to choose 
   smaller value for 'Association.Max.Retrans'. The Association.Max.Retrans indicates the
   threshold for the total number of consecutive error count for the entire SCTP association. 
   If the total of the error count for all paths exceeds this value, the endpoint considers 
   the peer endpoint unreachable and terminates the association. 
   According to the Section 8.2 in <xref target="RFC4960"/>, we should avoid having the value of 
   Association.Max.Retrans larger than the summation of the Path.Max.Retrans of 
   all the destination addresses. Otherwise, even if all the destination addresses become 
   inactive, the endpoint still considers the peer endpoint reachable. 
   The behavior in this situation is not defined in the RFC and depends on each implementation.
   In order to avoid inconsistent behavior between implementations, we had better use smaller 
   value for Association.Max.Retrans. 
   However, if we choose smaller value for Association.Max.Retrans, associations will prone 
   to be terminated with minor congestion.

  </t><t>
   Another issue is that the interval of heartbeat packet: 'HB.interval' may not be small.
   (recommended value is 30 seconds)  This means once failover takes place, an endpoint 
   might need a certain amount of time to use the primary path again. This can cause 
   undesirable effects in case of spurious failover. If we choose smaller value for HB.interval,
   the traffic used for path probing in a session will be increased.

  </t><t>
   The advantage of tuning Path.Max.Retrans is that it requires no modification to the current 
   standard, although it needs to ignore several recommendations. 
   In addition, some research results indicate path bouncing caused by spurious failover 
   does not cause serious problems. We discuss the effect of path bouncing 
   in the section 5. 
    </t>
   </section>
<section title="Adjust RTO related parameters">
   <t>
   As several research results indicate, we can also shorten the duration of failover process  
   by adjusting RTO related parameters 	
        <xref target="JUNGMAIER02"/>
   	<xref target="FALLON08"/>.
   During failover process, RTO keeps being doubled. However, if we can choose smaller value for RTO.max, 
   we can stop the exponential growth of RTO at some point.  Also, choosing smaller values for RTO.initial 
   or RTO.min can contribute to keep RTO value small.
  </t><t>
   Similar to reducing Path.Max.Retrans, the advantage of this approach is that it requires no modification 
   to the current standard, although it needs to ignore several recommendations. 
   However, this approach requires to have enough knowledge about the network characteristics between end points.
   Otherwise, it can introduce adverse side-effects such as spurious timeouts.
   </t>

 <section title="Proposed Solution: SCTP with Potentially-Failed Destination State (SCTP-PF)">
 <section title="SCTP-PF Description">
 <t>
   Our proposal stems from the following two observations about SCTP's failure detection procedure:

   <list style="symbols">
    <t>
    In order to minimize performance impact during failover, the sender should avoid transmitting data to the failed destination as early as possible. In the current SCTP path management scheme, the sender stops transmitting data to a destination only after the destination is marked Failed. Thus, a smaller PMR value is ideal so that the sender transitions a destination to the Failed state quicker. 
    </t>
    <t>
    Smaller PMR values increase the chances of spurious failure detection where the sender incorrectly marks a destination as Failed during periods of temporary congestion. Larger PMR values are preferable to avoid spurious failure detection.
    </t>
   </list>

    </t>
    <t>
   From the above observations it is clear that tweaking the PMR value involves the following tradeoff -- a lower value improves performance but increases the chances of spurious failure detection, whereas a higher value degrades performance and reduces spurious failure detection in a wide range of path conditions. Thus, tweaking the association's PMR value is an incomplete solution to address performance impact during failure. 
    </t>
    
    <t> We propose a new "Potentially-failed" (PF) destination state
   in SCTP's path management procedure. The PF state was originally proposed to improve CMT performance <xref target="NATARAJAN09" />. The PF state is an intermediate state between Active and Failed states. SCTP's failure detection procedure is modified to include the PF state. The new failure detection algorithm assumes that loss detected by a timeout implies either 
   severe congestion or failure en-route. After a single timeout on a path, 
   a sender is unsure, and marks the corresponding destination 
   as PF. A PF destination is not used for data transmission except in special cases (discussed below). The new failure detection algorithm requires only sender-side changes. Details are:

<list style="numbers">
   <t> 
    The sender maintains
   a new tunable parameter called Potentially-failed.Max.Retrans (PFMR). 
   The recommended value of PFMR = 0 when quick failover is used.
   When an association's PFMR >= PMR, quick failover is turned off.   

   </t>
   <t>
   Each time the T3-rtx timer expires on an active or idle destination,
   the error counter of that destination address will be incremented.
   When the value in the error counter exceeds PFMR, the endpoint should
   mark the destination transport address as PF. SCTP MUST NOT send any
   notification to the upper layer about the Active to PF state transition.
   </t>
   <t>The sender SHOULD avoid data transmission to PF destinations. 
   When all destinations are in either PF or Inactive state, the sender 
   MAY either move the destination from PF to Active state (and transmit data to 
   the active destination) or the sender MAY transmit data to a PF destination.
   In the former scenario, (i) the sender MUST NOT notify the ULP about the state transition, 
   and (ii) MUST NOT clear the destination's error counter. 
   It is recommended that the sender picks the PF destination with least error count
   (fewest consecutive timeouts) for data transmission.  
   In case of a tie (multiple PF destinations with same error count),
   the sender MAY choose the last active destination. 
   </t>
    <t>
  Only heartbeats MUST be sent to PF destination(s) once per RTO.
This means the sender SHOULD ignore
      HB.interval for PF destinations. If an heartbeat is unanswered, the sender
increments the error counter			
      and exponentially backs off the RTO value.  If error counter is
less than PMR, the sender SHOULD transmit
      another heartbeat immediately after T3-timer expiration. 
   </t>
   <t>
   When the sender receives an heartbeat ACK from a PF destination, 
   the sender clears the destination's error counter and transitions the PF destination 
   back to Active state. This state transition
   MUST NOT be notified to the ULP. This destination's 
   cwnd is set to 1 MTU.
   Note that in scenarios where the destination was temporarily congested during the T3-timer expiration, an SCTP 
   sender transmits 1 MTU worth of data while an SCTP-PF sender transmits an HB after the T3-timer expiry 
   (more details in Section 5 of [NATARAJAN09]). The SCTP sender has 1 RTT head-start in cwnd evolution 
   compared to SCTP-PF sender. An SCTP-PF sender may set cwnd to 2 MTUs after receiving HB-ACK in order to 
   offset this performance difference.
   </t>
   <t> 
   An additional (PMR - PFMR) consecutive timeouts on a PF destination 
   confirm the path failure, upon which the destination transitions to the 
   Inactive state. As described in <xref target="RFC4960"/>, the sender (i) SHOULD 
   notify ULP about this state transition, and (ii) transmit heartbeats 
   to the Inactive destination at a lower frequency as
   described in Section 8.3 of <xref target="RFC4960"/>.
   </t>
   <t>
   When all destinations are in the 
   Inactive state, the sender picks one of the Inactive destinations for data transmission. This proposal recommends that the 
   sender picks the Inactive destination with least error count
   (fewest consecutive timeouts) for data transmission. 
   In case of a tie (multiple Inactive destinations with same error count),
   the sender MAY choose the last active destination.    
   </t>
   <t>
   ACKs for retransmissions do not transition a PF destination back to Active state, 
   since a sender cannot disambiguate whether the ack was for the original transmission	
   or the retransmission(s).
   </t>
   </list>

   </t>
   </section>
   


<section title="Effect of Path Bouncing">
<t>
   The methods described above can accelerate failover process. 
   Hence, it might introduce path bouncing effect which keeps changing the data transmission
   path frequently. This sounds harmful for data transfer, however several research results
   indicate that there is no serious problem with SCTP in terms of path bouncing effect
   <xref target="CARO04" />
   <xref target="CARO05" />.
</t>
<t>
   There are two main reasons for this. First, SCTP is basically designed for multipath 
   communication, which means SCTP maintains all path related parameters (cwnd, ssthresh, 
   RTT, error count, etc) per each destination address. These parameters cannot be affected 
   by path bouncing.  
   In addition, when SCTP migrates to another path, it starts with minimal cwnd because of 
   slow-start. Hence, there is little chance for packet reordering or duplicating.
</t>
<t>
   Second, even if all communication paths between end-nodes share the same bottleneck, 
   the proposed method does not make situations worse. In case of congestion, the current 
   standard tries to transmit data packets to the primary during failover, while the 
   proposed method tries to explore other destinations.
   In any case, the same amount of data packets sent to the same bottleneck. 
</t>
</section>

<section title="Permanent Failover">
<t>
   Post failover, an SCTP sender migrates back to the original primary destination 
   once this destination becomes active. The sender sets cwnd to the initial cwnd value 
   and performs slow start. <xref target="CARO02" /> shows that the switch over to the 
   original primary may degrade SCTP performance compared to continuing data transmission 
   on the same path, especially in scenarios where this path's characteristics are better. 
   In order to mitigate this performance degradation, permanent failover was proposed in 
   <xref target="CARO02" />.  Permanent failover allows SCTP to remain the alternative 
   path even if the primary path becomes active again. We recommend that SCTP-PF should 
   stick to the standard RFC4960 behavior, i.e., switch back to the original primary once 
   this destination becomes active again. 
   Permanent failover may be considered in the future based on discussions and consensus within the community.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Handling of Association Error Counter">
<t>

When multiple destinations are in the PF state, the sender may transmit
heartbeats to multiple destinations at the same time. This allows SCTP-PF sender to
quickly track and respond to network status change compared to an SCTP sender. However, 
when all PF destinations become unavailable, an SCTP-PF sender has outstanding HBs 
on all destinations compared to an SCTP sender and increases the count for the total 
number of consecutive retransmissions faster than the SCTP sender. SCTP-PF's faster 
increase in the error count will result in association termination sooner than SCTP. 
The key difference between SCTP and SCTP-PF with regard to this feature is whether
checking path status sequentially or concurrently as the number of packets sent for 
probing is the same.
</t>
<t>

For deployments where aggressive failure detection and association termination is not desired, 
we suggest that AMR be set to the recommended maximum value (sum of PMRs of all paths), 
to delay assoc termination during SCTP-PF. Another option is to send retransmitted data
or HB to only one PF destination at a time, but this approach may 
delay path status tracking.  To exclude HB timeouts from incrementing
the error count can also be a solution, however, this requires an update to Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 of 
<xref target="RFC4960"/>, otherwise special logics for error counter need to be implemented for SCTP-PF.

</t>
