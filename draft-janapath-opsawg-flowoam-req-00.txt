          Requirements for OAM tools that enable flow Analysis
                 draft-janapath-opsawg-flowoam-req-00 


Abstract

   This document specifies Operations and Management (OAM) requirements
   that improve on the traditional OAM tools like Ping and  Traceroute.
   These requirements have arisen from the fact that more details than
   given by Ping and Traceroute are required while troubleshooting or
   doing performance and network planning. These requirements have been
   gathered from network operators especially from data centers where
   the networks have slightly different characteristics compared to
   regular campus/carrier networks.

1  Introduction

   Network operators have traditionally managed IP networks with classic
   OAM tools like Ping and Traceroute. Operators typically use Ping to
   perform end-2-end connectivity checks, and Traceroute to trace hop-
   by-hop path to a given destination. Traceroute is also used to
   isolate the point of failure along the path to a given destination.
   Also, while these are useful for basic connectivity checks, they are
   unable to provide sufficient information about the performance
   aspects of a path (e.g. utilization levels).

   In current networks especially data center networks, there are a
   large number of redundant paths and existing OAM tools are unable to
   identify flow specific problems and also do not provide sufficient
   information on the various paths which includes performance
   characteristics. What is needed is a set of tools that will perform
   the OAM functions based on header fields of actual user traffic.

2. Requirements

   The main requirement is being able to trace the exact path that a
   particular flow will take through the network and obtain all relevant
   information about the links along that path which provides the
   network operator with enough information to troubleshoot a network
   failure or quickly obtain performance data about that path.

   Increasing number of networks are using multi-path configurations to
   improve load-balancing and redundancy in their networks. These multi-
   paths could be in the form of ECMP paths offered by the routing
   protocols, but also Layer 2 ECMP paths (e.g. via TRILL [RFC 5556] or
   SPB [IEEE SPB]) and LAGs between adjacent routers. 

2.1 Flow tracing

   Ideally, the OAM trace packet should undergo the same processing at
   each node as would the actual application flow that is being traced.
   The forwarding process in switches and routers typically includes
   fields from the L2, IP, and transport (TCP/UDP) headers, to determine
   which member of an ECMP or LAG to forward the packet on. The OAM
   packets should also contain the flow entropy allowing for the same
   processing that a typical data packet would go through.

   Current tools like ping and Traceroute do not carry the application
   flow information, and hence the path that those packets follow
   through the network could differ from the packets of the specific
   flow that is of interest. 

2.2 Fate sharing and actual flow interference

   OAM probes while sharing fate with the actual flow, should not affect
   the real application in progress at the time of troubleshooting. The
   OAM request originating from the sender should not interfere with the
   actual application at the target host Likewise, the OAM  response
   should not go back to the real application at the originator of the
   OAM query.

2.2.1 Side effects of requirements 2.1 and 2.2

   To ensure that OAM packets share the same fate as that of the
   Application's packets, and yet do not get delivered to the
   application, it would be necessary to have an indication in the
   packet to distinguish OAM packets from regular application flow
   packets. The inclusion of such an indication in the packet should
   still result in the formation of a legitimate packet, and should not
   trigger security based drops or alarms at intermediate firewalls and
   IDS/IPS appliances, due to, say, an incorrect checksum or invalid

   fragment headers, that regular data packets would not normally
   experience.

   It would be useful for the operator to control which class of service
   is used by an OAM packet.  For example, when measuring one way or
   round trip delays, it would be useful to send it in the same class of
   service as regular data.

2.3 Capability to send the response to a monitoring station

   When tracing the flow from node A to node B, it should be possible to
   direct all the response packets to a third node C, which could be a
   management station. 

2.4 Terminating the trace on a transit device

   The tool should have the capability to terminate the trace at a
   specific hop specified by an IP address or by specifying a limit on
   the number of hops. This helps in segmented tracing, where portions
   of the path can be traced.

2.5 Flow monitoring

   It should be possible to initiate flow monitoring on one or all of
   the intermediate devices, and should have the following capabilities.

2.5.1 Parameters for monitoring

   The tool should provide an extensible mechanism by which the
   monitoring station can ask for monitoring of certain parameters for
   the flow like input rate, packet drops, etc at a given network node.
   It should also be possible to request for packet samples for external
   monitoring tool to calculate statistics on the flow or interfaces

   The requested device may honor the monitoring request based on its
   policy, authentication of the requester and also the available
   resources on the device. It should be able to indicate back in the
   response if and what parts of the monitoring are activated.

   The period for which this monitoring is activated could be...

2.5.1.1 Time-based and Monitor-till-stop monitoring

   The OAM packet carries a time period and frequency of sampling, and
   the requested devices send the samples at the specified frequency for
   the specified time period. This could also be overridden by local
   policy. In case of the Monitor-till-stop monitoring the OAM packet
   will initiate the monitoring at a specific sampling rate. The

INTERNET DRAFT OAM Reqts. tools that enable flow Analysis       May 2012


   monitoring will continue till there is a new request for turning off
   the monitoring. A local policy can also override this behavior and
   restrict this to a maximum period that is locally defined.

2.6 Loop Detection

   The tool should be capable of detecting that OAM packets are being
   looped. If this happens the operation should be aborted. Appropriate
   heuristics may be considered while implementing this feature.

2.7  Additional Information

   Apart from reporting the incoming and outgoing interfaces, it would
   be useful for the tool to report on the following

2.7.1 Link statistics 

   There is a necessity to collect useful information to enable
   operators to perform more detailed problem analysis or network
   optimization. The operator may need to know the utilization of the
   links along the path in addition to the fan-out information. This
   information could be for example be used by servers to selec source
   ephemeral ports in such a way as to avoid over-utilized links.  Also
   disparities in LAG members with respect to over-utilization of some
   links and under-utilization of others could help the operator to
   tweak some of the available parameters or available hash functions
   for better load distribution.

2.7.2 Packet drops and their reasons

   Packets may get dropped due to a variety of reasons, and the OAM
   mechanism should be able to indicate the actual reasons for drop. The
   response OAM packet should indicate the error code appropriately for
   various reasons why a packet may have been dropped.

2.8 Additional enhancements

   Data center networks and applications have specialized needs. To
   accomplish this the new tools provide certain additional information
   for the data centers such as the following.

2.8.1 Fat-Tree traversal.

   The tracing of a fat-tree (i.e. all paths) from the source to the
   destination is a very important requirement from modern day
   administrators running say a data-center. This could be done within
   an administrative boundary and not beyond it.

2.8.2 Hash Algorithm Parameters

   When choosing from a set of ECMP links or LAG members it is common
   for a hash function to be performed on select header fields. This
   hash algorithm is important with respect to which ECMP or LAG member
   is chosen to forward the packet on. It would be useful to know which
   fields play a part in the computation of this choice. The actual hash
   function may be internal to the device and need not be returned since
   it may be proprietary to the vendor but the header fields accounted
   for in the hash function would provide enough information for the
   system / network administrator to vary these parameters in order to
   figure out a specific path through which the traffic for a flow or a
   set of flows can be engineered.

2.9 Future Requirements

   The requirements specified in this document relate to tools for
   trouble shooting IP layer connectivity with respect to IP nodes in
   the path from source to destination. This draft deals with tracing
   the IP nodes such as transit devices and the end target destination.
   A future version of this set of requirements would look at tracing
   the intermediate network between IP nodes.  

3  Security Considerations

   This section discusses threats to which these new set of tools might
   be vulnerable and discusses means by which those threats might be
   mitigated.

   The following are some of the security requirements that need to be
   adhered to under this framework.

3.1 Securing Requests and Responses

   Tool developed under this framework should require mechanisms to
   secure the requests and responses. The security provided for these
   requests and responses should ensure integrity of these packets and
   ensure confidentiality if necessary. An administrator should be able
   to select the information that will be sent in insecure messages,
   should such secure mechanisms not be available. For example, the set
   of information exchanged in that case could be limited to the
   information obtainable via traditional Ping and Traceroute.

3.2 Information hiding

   There is a concern that tools developed to satisfy the requirements
   in this document might allow an external user to probe the detailed
   path that a flow takes through a network. To address this the network
 


Janardhanan Pathangi     Expires November 2012                  [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT OAM Reqts. tools that enable flow Analysis       May 2012


   operator could associate multiple security levels with the different
   types of information that may be included in the response to a
   discovery packet coming from a legitimate tool. For example only the
   "Next Hop Router" may be marked as publicly accessible information
   whereas everything else may be marked as private information. On
   receiving a flow discovery request packet originating outside the
   local network, only the publicly accessible information should be
   included in the response to the originator. However if the request
   was originated by a legitimate, known source the device could include
   all of the requested information in the response.

   The Result and Additional Information types specified in the section
   2.7 provide detailed information about the processing of the request
   packet and may possibly leak information about the locally configured
   policies. The amount of information to be included in these sets of
   data should also depend on whether the request was originated from a
   legitimate source. The network operator may choose to silently drop
   the Flow Discovery Request packet without providing any indication of
   the reason for doing so if the request was originated externally.

3.3 Rate limiting obviating attack vectors

   Today most network operators throttle conventional OAM traffic (ping
   and traceroute, and other ICMP messages) that is serviced by the
   device to protect against Denial-of-Service attacks. Such mechanisms
   should be employed for OAM packets under this framework for the same
   reason.

4  IANA Considerations

   This document does not need any consideration from IANA.

   It is likely that tools under this framework may require new IANA
   assigned protocol ports that signify the specific OAM protocol that
   is to be implemented to satisfy such requirements. Tools developed to
   satisfy will require such IANA assignments as the needs arise.
