    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The purpose of this draft is to analyze the mapping between the
      Network Virtualization over L3 (NVO3) <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-overlay-problem-statement"></xref> requirements
      and the capabilities of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) <xref
      target="RFC6830"></xref> control plane. This information is provided as
      input to the NVO3 analysis of the suitability of existing IETF protocols
      to the NVO3 requirements.</t>

      <t>LISP is a flexible map and encap framework that can be used for
      overlay network applications, including Data Center Network
      Virtualization.</t>

      <t>The LISP framework provides two main tools for NVO3: (1) a Data Plane
      that specifies how Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) are encapsulated in
      Routing Locators (RLOCs), and (2) a Control Plane that specifies the
      interfaces to the LISP Mapping System that provides the mapping between
      EIDs and RLOCs.</t>

      <t>This document focuses on the control plane for L2 over L3 LISP
      encapsulation, where EIDs are associated with MAC addresses. As such the
      LISP control plane can be used with the data path encapsulations defined
      in VXLAN <xref target="I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan"></xref> and in
      NVGRE <xref target="I-D.sridharan-virtualization-nvgre"></xref>. The
      LISP control plane can, of course, be used with the L2 LISP data path
      encapsulation defined in <xref
      target="I-D.smith-lisp-layer2"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The LISP control plane provides the Mapping Service for the Network
      Virtualization Edge (NVE), mapping per-tenant end system identity
      information on the corresponding location at the NVE. As required by
      NVO3, LISP supports network virtualization and tenant separation to hide
      tenant addressing information, tenant-related control plane activity and
      service contexts from the underlay network.</t>

      <t>The LISP control plane is extensible, and can support non-LISP data
      path encapsulations such as <xref
      target="I-D.sridharan-virtualization-nvgre"></xref>, or other
      encapsulations that provide support for network virtualization. <xref
      target="RFC6832"></xref> specifies an open interworking framework to
      allow LISP to non-LISP sites communication.</t>

      <t>Broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast in the overlay network are
      supported by either replicated unicast, or core-based multicast as
      specified in <xref target="RFC6831"></xref>, <xref
      target="I-D.farinacci-lisp-mr-signaling"></xref>, and <xref
      target="I-D.farinacci-lisp-te"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Finally, the LISP architecture has a modular design that allows the
      use of different Mapping Databases, provided that the interface to the
      Mapping System remains the same <xref target="RFC6833"></xref>. This
      allows for different Mapping Databases that may fit different NVO3
      deployments. As an example of the modularity of the LISP Mapping System,
      a worldwide LISP pilot network is currently using an hierarchical
      Delegated Database Tree <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-ddt"></xref>, after
      having been operated for years with an overlay BGP mapping
      infrastructure <xref target="RFC6836"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The LISP mapping system supports network virtualization, and a single
      mapping infrastructure can run multiple instances, either public or
      private, of the mapping database.</t>

      <t>The rest of this document, after giving a quick a LISP overview in
      <xref target="overview"></xref>, follows the functional model defined in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-framework"></xref> that provides in <xref
      target="reference"></xref> an overview of the LISP NVO3 reference model,

    <section anchor="overview" title="LISP Overview">
      <t>This section provides a quick overview of L2 LISP, with focus on
      control plane operations.</t>

      <t>The modular and extensible architecture of the LISP control plane
      allows its use with both L2 or L3 LISP data path encapsulation. In fact,
      the LISP control plane can be used even with other L2 overlay data path
      encapsulations such as VXLAN and NVGRE. When used with VXLAN, the LISP
      control plane replaces the use of dynamic data plane learning
      (Flood-and-Learn), as specified in <xref
      target="I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan"></xref> improving scalability
      and mitigating multicast requirements in the underlay network.</t>

      <t>For a detailed LISP overview please refer to <xref
      target="RFC6830"></xref> and related drafts.</t>

      <t>To exemplify LISP operations let&rsquo;s consider two data centers
      (LISP sites) A and B that provide L2 network virtualization services to
      a number of tenant end systems, as depicted in <xref
      target="l2-nve"></xref>. The Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) are encoded
      according to <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf"></xref> as an
      &lt;IID,MAC&gt; tuple that contains the Instance ID, or Virtual Network
      Identifier (VNI), and the endpoint Ethernet/IEEE 802 MAC address.</t>

      <t>The data centers are connected via a L3 underlay network, hence the
      Routing Locators (RLOCs) are IP addresses (either IPv4 or IPv6) encoded
      according to <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In LISP the network virtualization edge function is performed by
      Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) that are responsible for encapsulating the
      LISP ingress traffic, and Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) that are
      responsible for decapsulating the LISP egress traffic. ETRs are also
      responsible to register the EID-to-RLOC mapping for a given LISP site in
      the LISP mapping database system. ITRs and ETRs are collectively
      referred as xTRs.</t>

      <t>The EID-to-RLOC mapping is stored in the LISP mapping database, a
      distributed mapping infrastructure accessible via Map Servers (MS) and
      Map Resolvers (MR). <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-ddt"></xref> is an
      example of a mapping database used in many LISP deployments. Another
      example of of mapping database is <xref target="RFC6836"></xref>.</t>

      <t>For small deployments the mapping infrastructure can be very minimal,
      in some cases even a single system running as MS/MR.</t>

      <section anchor="configuration" title="LISP Site Configuration">
        <t>In each LISP site the xTRs are configured with an IP address (the
        site RLOCs) per each interface facing the underlay network.</t>

        <t>Similarly the MS/MR are assigned an IP address in the RLOC
        space.</t>

        <t>The configuration of the xTRs includes the RLOCs of the MS/MR and a
        shared secret that is optionally used to secure the communication
        between xTRs and MS/MR.</t>

        <t>To provide support for multi-tenancy multiple instances of the
        mapping database are identified by a LISP Instance ID (IID), that is
        equivalent to the 24-bit VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) or Tenant
        Network Identifier (TNI) that identifies tenants in <xref

      <section anchor="provisioning" title="End System Provisioning">
        <t>We assume that a provisioning framework will be responsible for
        provisioning end systems (e.g. VMs) in each data center. The
        provisioning system configures each end system with an Ethernet/IEEE
        802 MAC address and/or IP address and provisions the NVE with other
        end system specific attributes such as VLAN information, and TS/VLAN
        to VNI mapping information. LISP does not introduce new addressing
        requirements for end systems.</t>

        <t>The provisioning infrastructure is also responsible to provide a
        network attach function, that notifies the network virtualization edge
        (the LISP site ETR) that the end system is attached to a given virtual
        network (identified by its VNI/IID) and that the end system is
        identified, within that virtual network, by a given Ethernet/IEEE 802
        MAC address.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="registration" title="End System Registration">
        <t>Upon notification of end system network attach, that includes the
        EID=&lt;IID,MAC&gt; tuple that identifies that end system, the ETR
        sends a LISP Map-Register to the Mapping System. The Map-Register
        includes the EID and RLOCs of the LISP site. The EID-to-RLOC mapping
        is now available, via the Mapping System Infrastructure, to other LISP
        sites that are hosting end systems that belong to the same tenant.</t>

      <section anchor="flow" title="Packet Flow and Control Plane Operations">
        <t>This section provides an example of the unicast packet flow and the
        control plane operations when in the topology shown in <xref
        target="l2-nve"></xref> end system W, in LISP site A, wants to
        communicate to end system Y in LISP site B. We&rsquo;ll assume that W
        knows Y&rsquo;s EID MAC address (e.g. learned via ARP).</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>W sends an Ethernet/IEEE 802 MAC frame with destination
            EID=&lt;IID1,MAC_Y&gt; and source EID=&lt;IID1,MAC_W&gt;.</t>

            <t>ITR A does a lookup in its local map-cache for the destination
            EID=&lt;IID1, MAC_Y&gt;. Since this is the first packet sent to
            MAC_Y, the map-cache is a miss, and the ITR sends a Map-request to
            the mapping database system looking up the
            EID=&lt;IID1,MAC_Y&gt;.</t>

            <t>The mapping systems forwards the Map-Request to ETR B, that is
            aware of the EID-to-RLOC mapping for &lt;IID1,MAC_Y&gt;.
            Alternatively, depending on the mapping system configuration, a
            Map-Server which is part of the mapping database system may send a
            Map-Reply directly to ITR A.</t>

            <t>ETR B sends a Map-Reply to ITR A that includes the EID-to-RLOC
            mapping: EID=&lt;IID1,MAC_Y&gt; -&gt; RLOC=IP_B, where IP_B is the
            locator of ETR B, hence the locator of LISP site B. In order to
            facilitate interoperability, the Map-Reply may also include
            attributes such as the data plane encapsulations supported by the
            ETR.</t>

            <t>ITR A populates the local map-cache with the EID to RLOC
            mapping, and either L2 LISP, VXLAN, or NVGRE encapsulates all
            subsequent packets with a destination EID=&lt;IID1,MAC_Y&gt; with
            a destination RLOC=IP_B.</t>
          </list>It should be noted how the LISP mapping system replaces the
        use of Flood-and-Learn based on multicast distribution trees
        instantiated in the underlay network (required by VXLAN&rsquo;s
        dynamic data plane learning), with a unicast control plane and a cache
        mechanism that &ldquo;pulls&rdquo; on-demand the EID-to-RLOC mapping
        from the LISP mapping database. This improves scalability, and
        simplifies the configuration of the underlay network.</t>

                 title="Supporting ARP Resolution with LISP Mapping System">
          <t>A large majority of data center applications are IP based, and in
          those use cases end systems are provisioned with IP addresses as
          well as MAC addresses.</t>

          <t>In this case, to eliminate the flooding of ARP traffic and
          further reduce the need for multicast in the underlay network, the
          LISP mapping system is used to support ARP resolution at the ITR. We
          assume that as shown in <xref target="l3-nve"></xref>: (1) end
          system W has an IP address IP_W, and end system Y has an IP address
          IP_Y, (2) end system W knows Y&rsquo;s IP address (e.g. via DNS
          lookup). We also assume that during registration Y has registered
          both its MAC address and its IP address as EID. End system Y is then
          identified by the EID = &lt;IID1,IP_Y,MAC_Y&gt;.</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>End system W sends a broadcast ARP message to discover the
              MAC address of end system Y. The message contains IP_Y in the
              ARP message payload.</t>

              <t>ITR A, acting as a L2 switch, will receive the ARP message,
              but rather than flooding it on the overlay network sends a
              Map-Request to the mapping database system for EID =
              &lt;IID1,IP_Y,*&gt;.</t>

              <t>The Map-Request is routed by the mapping system
              infrastructure to ETR B, that will send a Map-Reply back to ITR
              A containing the mapping EID=&lt;IID1,IP_Y,MAC_Y&gt; -&gt;
              RLOC=IP_B, (the locator of ETR B). Alternatively, depending on
              the mapping system configuration, a Map-Server in the mapping
              system may send directly a Map-Reply to ITR A.</t>

              <t>ITR A populates the map-cache with the received entry, and
              sends an ARP-Agent Reply to W that includes MAC_Y and IP_Y.</t>

              <t>End system W learns MAC_Y from the ARP message and can now
              send a packet to end system Y by including MAC_Y, and IP_Y, as
              destination addresses.</t>

              <t>ITR A will then process the packet as specified in Section
              3.4.</t>
            </list>This example shows how LISP, by replacing dynamic data
          plane learning (Flood-and-Learn) largely reduces the need for
          multicast in the underlay network, that is needed only when
          broadcast, unknown unicast or multicast are required by the
          applications in the overlay. In practice, the LISP mapping system,
          constrains ARP within the boundaries of a link-local protocol. This
          simplifies the configuration of the underlay network and removes the
          significant scalability limitation imposed by VXLAN
          Flood-and-Learn.</t>

          <t>It&rsquo;s important to note that the use of the LISP mapping
          system, by pulling the EID-to-RLOC mapping on demand, also improves
          end system mobility across data centers.</t>

        <t>This section shows how the LISP control plane deals with mobility
        when end systems are migrated from one Data Center to another. We'll
        assume that a signaling protocol, as described in <xref
        target="I-D.kompella-nvo3-server2nve"></xref>, signals to the NVE
        operations such as creating/terminating/migrating an end system. The
        signaling protocol consists of three basic messages: "associate",
        "dissociate", and "pre-associate".</t>

        <t>Let's consider the scenario shown in <xref

          </figure>As a result of the end system registration, described in
        <xref target="registration"></xref>, the Mapping System contains the
        EID-to-RLOC mapping for end system W that associates EID=&lt;IID1,
        MAC_W&gt; with the RLOC(s) associated with LISP site A (IP_A).</t>

        <t>The process of migrating end system W from data center A to data
        center B is initiated.</t>

        <t>ETR B receives a pre-associate message that includes EID=&lt;IID1,
        MAC_W&gt;. ETR B sends a Map-Register to the mapping system
        registering RLOC=IP_B as an additional locator for end system W with
        priority set to 255. This means that the RLOC MUST NOT be used for
        unicast forwarding, but the mapping system is now aware of the new
        location.</t>

        <t>During the migration process of end system W, ETR A receives a
        dissociate message, and sends a Map-Register with Record TTL=0 to
        signal the mapping system that end system W is no longer reachable at
        RLOC=IP_A. xTR A will also add an entry in its forwarding table that
        marks EID=&lt;IID1, MAC_W&gt; as non-local. When end system W has
        completed its migration, ETR B receives an associate message for end
        system W, and sends a Map-Register to the mapping system setting a
        non-255 priority for RLOC=IP_B. Now the mapping system is updated with
        the new EID-to-RLOC mapping for end system W with the desired
        priority.</t>

        <t>The remote ITRs that were corresponding with end system W during
        the migration will keep sending packets to ETR A. ETR A will keep
        forwarding locally those packets until it receives a dissociate
        message, and the entry in the forwarding table associated with
        EID=&lt;IID1, MAC_W&gt; is marked as non-local. Subsequent packets
        arriving at ETR A from a remore ITR, and destined to end system W will
        hit the entry in the forwarding table that will generate an exception,
        and will generate a Solicit-Map-Request (SMR) message that is returned
        to the remote ITR. Upon receiving the SMR the remote ITR will
        invalidate its local map-cache entry for EID=&lt;IID1, MAC_W&gt; and
        send a new Map-Request for that EID. The Map-Request will generate a
        Map-Reply that includes the new EID-to-RLOC mapping for end system W
        with RLOC=IP_B. Similarly, unencapsulated packets arriving at ITR A
        from local end systems and destined to end system W will hit the entry
        in the forwarding table marked as non-local, and will generate an
        exception that by sending a Map-Request for EID=&lt;IID1, MAC_W&gt;
        will populate the map-cache of ITR A with an EID-to-RLOC mapping for
        end system W with RLOC=IP_B.</t>

        <t>The two examples above shows how the LISP control plane can be used
        in combination with either L2 LISP, VXLAN, or NVGRE encapsulation to
        provide L2 network virtualization services across data centers.</t>

        <t>There is a trend, led by Massive Scalable Data Centers, that is
        accelerating the adoption of L3 network services in the data center,

        <t>LISP, as defined in <xref target="RFC6830"></xref>, provides L3
        network virtualization services over an L3 underlay network that, as
        an alternative to L2 overlay solutions, matches the requirements for
        DC Network Virtualization. L2 overlay solutions are necessary for Data
        Centers that rely on non IPv4/IPv6 protocols, but when IP is pervasive
        L3 LISP provides a better and more scalable overlay.</t>

      <t><xref target="nvo3-ref-model"></xref>, taken from <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-framework"></xref>, introduces the NVO3 reference
      model.</t>

      <t>In a LISP NVO3 network the Tenant Systems (TS) that are homed to a
      common NVE, having specific Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), are part of a
      'LISP site'.</t>

      <t>The network virtualization edge (NVE) function is performed by
      Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) that are responsible for encapsulating the
      LISP ingress traffic, and Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) that are
      responsible for de-encapsulating the LISP egress traffic. </t>

      <t>The outer tunnel IP addresses (either IPv4 or IPv6) on the ITR and
      ETR NVE function are known as Routing Locators (RLOCs). </t>

      <t>ETRs are also responsible to register the EID-to-RLOC mapping for a
      given LISP site in the LISP mapping database system <xref
      target="RFC6833"></xref> . </t>

      <t>ITRs and ETRs, collectively referred as xTRs, provide for tenant
      separation, perform the encap/decap function, and interface with the
      LISP Mapping System that maps tenant addressing information (in the EID
      name space) on the underlay L3 infrastructure (in the RLOC name space),
      with the encoding defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf"></xref>.
      </t>

      <t>The LISP Mapping system is a distributed mapping infrastructure,
      accessible via Map Servers (MS) and Map Resolvers (MR), that performs
      the NVA function. </t>

      <t>The LISP Mapping system can be scaled across various physical
      components e.g. across an EID based hierarchy as described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-lisp-ddt"></xref>. EID prefixes and/or address families
      can thus be scaled across the mapping infrastructure if needed. </t>

      <t>The NVA function can offer a northbound SDN interface in order to
      program the EID to RLOC mapping from e.g. an orchestration system. An
      example is given in <xref target="I-D.barkai-lisp-nfv"></xref> .</t>

      <t>As traffic reaches An ingress NVE, the corresponding ITR uses the
      LISP Map-Request/Reply service to determine the location of the
      destination End System.</t>

      <t>The LISP mapping system combines the distribution of address
      advertisement and (stateless) tunneling provisioning.</t>

      <t>LISP defines several mechanisms for determining RLOC reachability,
      including Locator Status Bits, "nonce echoing", and RLOC probing. Please
      see Sections 5.3 and 6.3 of <xref target="RFC6830"></xref>. However,
      given the fact that DC's are typically deployed with a single stage IGP
      hierarchy, the IGP responsible for the RLOC space offers enough
      reachability information.</t>

        <section anchor="vap" title="Virtual Attachment Points (VAPs)">
          <t>In a LISP NVE, Tunnel Routers (xTRs) implement the NVE
          functionality on ToRs or Virtual Switches. Tenant Systems attach to
          the Virtual Access Points (VAPs) provided by the xTRs (either a
          physical port or a virtual interface). </t>

          <t>The VAPs are identified by either a physical port or a virtual
          interface, e.g. Indexed by VLAN tags, a set, range, or set of ranges
          of VLAN tags in the case of a L2 service, or a virtual routed
          interface Indexed by a VLAN in case of a L3 service, or a

                 title="Overlay Modules and Tenant ID">
          <t>The xTR also implements the function of NVE Overlay Module, by
          mapping the addressing information (EIDs) of the tenant packet on
          the appropriate locations (RLOCs) in the underlay network. The
          Virtual Network Identifier (VNI) is encoded in the encapsulated
          packet (either in the 24-bit IID field of the LISP header for L2/L3
          LISP encapsulation, or in the 24-bit VXLAN Network Identifier field
          for VXLAN encapsulation, or in the 24-bit NVGRE Tenant Network
          Identifier field of NVGRE). In a LISP NVE globally unique (per
          administrative domain) VNIs are used to identify the Tenant
          instances.</t>

          <t>The mapping of the tenant packet address onto the underlay
          network location is &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; on-demand from the mapping
          system, and cached at the NVE in a per-VNI map-cache.</t>

        <section anchor="tenant-instance" title="Tenant Instance">
          <t>Tenants are mapped on LISP Instance IDs (IIDs), and the LISP
          Control Plane uses the IID to provide segmentation and
          virtualization. The ETR is responsible to register the Tenant System
          to the LISP mapping system, via the Map-Register service provided by
          LISP Map-Servers (MS). The Map-Register includes the IID that is
          used to identify the tenant.</t>

          <t>The LISP control protocol, as defined today, provides support for
          L2 LISP and VXLAN L2 over L3 encapsulation, and LISP L3 over L3
          encapsulation, as well as support for the Generic Protocol

            <t>The LISP framework does not include mechanisms to provision the
            local NVE with the appropriate Tenant Instance for each Tenant
            System. Other protocols, such as VDP (in IEEE P802.1Qbg), should
            be used to implement a network attach/detach function.</t>

            <t>The LISP control plane can take advantage of such a network
            attach/detach function to trigger the registration of a Tenant End
            System to the Mapping System. This is particularly helpful to
            handle mobility across DC of the Tenant End System.</t>

            <t>It is possible to extend the LISP control protocol to advertise
            the tenant service instance (tenant and service type provided) to
            other NVEs, and facilitate interoperability between NVEs that are
            using different service types.</t>

            <t>The LISP mapping system combines the distribution of address
            advertisement and (stateless) tunneling provisioning.</t>

            <t>When EIDs are mapped on both IP addresses and MACs, the need to
            flood ARP messages at the NVE is eliminated resolving the issues

          underlay is no longer required (at least for IP traffic) for unicast
          overlay services.</t>

        <section anchor="separation"

          <t>LISP introduces a clear separation between data plane and control

          doesn&rsquo;t require packet format changes in multicast routing
          protocols, and doesn&rsquo;t impose changes in the internal
          operation of multicast in a LISP site. The only operational changes

      <t>Additional security mechanisms to protect the LISP Map-Register
