Internet-Draft         Optimal Transmission Window             June 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an ICMPv6 Router Advertisement [RFC4861]
   option, which the router can use in an attempt to schedule and
   synchronize periodical communication activities of the hosts router
   provides routing services for.  The option describes an optimal
   transmission window, during which hosts should perform periodic
   transmissions.

   In certain deployments routers are very power constrained.  A class
   of such routers are battery powered cellular phones that are sharing
   the wireless cellular connection to wireless local area networks.
   Hosts in the local area networks may be, for example, personal
   computers or low-energy sensors.

   In 3GPP cellular networks the radio, once activated, stays on for
   some time based on network-specific timer values [Haverinen2007].
   This means that, for example, a single packet originated by a host in
   a local area network and routed via a cellular handset can cause
   handset's uplink radio to be activated into a significantly power
   consuming state for tens of seconds.

   The power consumption problem is made worse if a router provides
   connectivity services for multitude of hosts and, in the case of
   cellular handset, also provides connectivity for internal
   applications as well.  Potentially several different entities are
   sending keep-alive and/or other periodic messages at random times and
   by so doing causing router's uplink radio to be activated
   unnecessarily often.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

      R:           If set, the optimal transmission window is open
                   when the Router Advertisement was sent. If not set,
                   the window may not be open.
      SWF:         Decimal value indicating secondary transmission
                   window timing as fractions of Interval. Value
                   of zero indicates lack of secondary transmission
                   windows. Other values are used as dividers for

                   '1000').

      Interval:    The time between optimal transmission windows, in

      Next:        The time to the start of the next optimal
                   transmission window in milliseconds.
      Duration:    The time the optimal transmission window is open in
                   milliseconds, for example, how long the router
                   estimates the radio to be at least active.


3.  Router Behavior

   A router that attempts to synchronize periodic transmission of hosts
   it serves MUST include Optimal Transmission Window option in all
   ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages it originates.

   If the uplink radio is active at the time of sending the Router
   Advertisement, a router SHOULD set the R-bit on to indicate
   immediately suitable time for transmissions.  Furthermore, in the
   event of uplink radio activation, a router MAY send otherwise
   unscheduled Router Advertisement message with R-bit set in order to
   indicate unscheduled power efficient transmission opportunity for
   hosts.

Internet-Draft         Optimal Transmission Window             June 2012


   The router using this option MUST set the Interval-field to exactly
   match the optimal sending window, as some hosts receiving the ICMPv6
   Router Advertisement can choose to go to sleep until the optimal
   transmission window opens.  The value for the interval-field is
   router's implementation decision and depends on the deployment
   scenario.  A default value of INTERVAL_DEFAULT (see Section 5) is
   defined for the cases where router has no better information.
   Interval field value of zero indicates transmission window to be
   always open.  The SWF-field indicates presence and time of secondary
   transmission windows during one Interval.  For example, default value
   of 8 indicates secondary transmission window to occur at every
   INTERVAL_DEFAULT/8.

   With the default values for INTERVAL_DEFAULT and SWF-field hosts have
   secondary transmission window every 100 seconds, which is enough in
   case host needs to refresh UDP mappings of NAT utilizing two minute
   expiration time (see section 4.3 of [RFC4787]).

   The Next-field MUST be always set to point to the moment of the next
   optimal transmission window.  Even if the R-bit is set, the Next-
   field MUST nevertheless point to the start of the next optimal
   transmission window.

   The Duration-field MUST indicate the length of the window during
   which hosts should start their periodic transmissions.  The length
   has to be at least MIN_WINDOW_DURATION (see Section 5).

   The secondary transmission window bitfield indicates possibly
   alternative, but still synchronized, times for hosts to transmit if
   the optimal sending window interval frequency is too low.

   If the router implements synchronization services for router's
   internal applications' periodical communications, the router MUST
   synchronize the internal applications to communicate during the same
   optimal transmission window.


4.  Host Behavior

   A host MUST utilize the timing information received via Optimal
   Transmission Window option and time it's periodic transmissions
   accordingly, when possible.  Additionally, a host MAY use Router
   Advertisement with this option and R-bit set as trigger for
   communications.  The host MUST refresh it's timing states after every
   received Router Advertisement message.

   The host MUST wait for a random period of time between the start of
   the optimal transmission window, or reception of a Router

   Advertisement with R-bit set, and COLLISION_AVOIDANCE_DURATION (see
   Section 5) in order to avoid collisions caused by multitude of hosts
   transmitting at the same time.

   Sometimes a host needs to perform time consuming operations on the
   link before transmitting to the Internet, such as performing
   Detecting Network Attachment-procedures [RFC6059] if the host has
   been asleep long enough.  In such cases, the host SHOULD perform time
   consuming operations before the communications are scheduled to take
   place.

   The host does not have to transmit during every window, but SHOULD
   use the one right before the application's optimal periodic
   communication event.  If the host is running application that
   requires more frequent periodic messaging that what the optimal
   transmission window provides, the host SHOULD attempt to communicate
   during secondary transmission windows as configured via SWF-field.

   The host MUST only use timing values as learned from the Router
   Advertisement message that has been used for the highest priority
   default router configuration.  If a host supports more-specific
   routes [RFC4191], the host SHOULD also record optimal transmission
   window schedules for each more-specific route.

   The host SHOULD provide an implementation specific application
   programming interface that applications can use to learn the optimal
   transmission window schedules.  If the host maintains destination-
   specific optimal transmission window timing information, the
   application programming interface SHOULD allow applications to ask
   for the timing information specific to a destination.

   The host does not have to transmit in every optimal sending window.


5.  Protocol Constants

   Following constants are defined for the operation of the Optimal
   Transmission Window Configuration option.

   INTERVAL_DEFAULT: 800 seconds

   MIN_WINDOW_DURATION: 1000 milliseconds

   COLLISION_AVOIDANCE_DURATION: 100 milliseconds

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests IANA to allocate a type value from the "IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" registry for the option defined at
   the Section 2.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies that a host uses timing information only from
   the Router Advertisements the host accepts for configuring default
   and more-specific routes.  This helps to mitigate against attacks
   that try to influence transmission schedules by sending malicious
   Router Advertisements.

   With this option it is not possible to hinder host's communications,
   as the option is an optimization that help nodes to synchronize
   transmissions with each other, while allowing transmissions at any
   time when necessary.  Therefore, if the timing values sent in Router
   Advertisement do not make sense for a host, or it's applications, the
   values will be ignored.
