     Asserting Administrative Policies and Boundaries in DNS Zones
                draft-sullivan-zone-policy-assertions-01

Abstract

   Some security policies on the Internet depend on the idea of the
   "domain policy" or "zone policy".  It is difficult to discover such
   policies, and it is harder to do so in a way that does not subject
   operators of domains to others' assertions.  This memo describes the
   problem, and proposes a mechanism for solving it.

1.  Introduction

   [[anchor2: This document contains ideas that may have been the result
   of a visit from the bad idea fairy.  It's still pretty sketchy.  You
   have been warned.  The document title is "zone" policy, and yet I've
   already convinced myself that it could be at any name, which sort of
   shows this isn't ready yet. --ajs@anvilwalrusden.com]] Many network
   resources are accessed primarily by name.  DNS names make up a
   fundamental part of the name by which people or other systems access
   those network resources.  As a result, DNS names have become
   fundamental elements in building security policies and user agent
   behaviour.

   Unfortunately, most of the attempts to build useful security policies
   around DNS names are based on rules of thumb that mostly work but
   that fail in ways surprising to users, to security system designers,
   or both.  The failures are both too broad and too narrow: sometimes,
   failures prevent (or just make inconvenient) a desired use, while
   other times failures do not catch actual problems and permit things
   like cross-site scripting attacks.  In general, the failures stem
   from a misunderstanding of what a domain name means, what a policy of
   "same origin" would look like, and what information the DNS can
   actually provide.

1.1.  Example cases

   o  The HTTP Cookies specification (formally known as "HTTP State
      Management Mechanism", [RFC6265]) depends on matching domain names
      and subdomains.
   o  Some web browsers have adopted a list of "public" domain names
      that are known to be delegation-centric (the publicsuffix.org
      list).
   o  Some web browsers use lists of officially-approved domain names
      near the DNS root to identify those where U-labels are to be
      displayed.  If a name is not in the list, Internationalized Domain
      Names (IDNs) are displayed.  (This is not based on the
      publicsuffix.org list, but the principle is the same.)
   o  Many clients -- especially but not only web browsers -- use a
      "same origin" policy for following links to apparently related
      content.


2.  What is the Problem?

   The use of domain names as a mechanism for identifying administrative
   boundaries is problematic for several reasons.

   1.  The Start of Authority (SOA) Resource Record marks the boundary
       of a zone, but not the boundary of administrative control.  For
       instance, the operator of example.com might delegate
       remoteoffice.example.com, inserting an SOA record at the apex of
       remoteoffice.example.com.  For legal and organizational purposes,
       everything under example.com is one administrative domain.  The
       remoteoffice.example.com delegation is only for administrative
       convenience.  By the same token, a large zone might contain
       multiple domains that share a common SOA record, but that are
       actually completely separated for administrative purposes (this
       pattern of use is common in large corporations and academic
       institutions).
   2.  Even if the SOA record were a reliable indicator of
       organizational boundaries, in the absence of DNSSEC is it not
       convenient to find.
   3.  The publicsuffix.org list has no mechanism (apart from manual
       updates) to ensure it remains in sync with the actual delegation
       pattern on the Internet.  It will not scale.
   4.  The publicsuffix.org list appears not to understand empty non-
       terminals.
   5.  IDN display policies that depend on the policies of domains near
       the root implicitly assume that IDN policies are transitive from
       parent to child.
   6.  Previous experiences with static lists of domain names maintained
       outside the DNS suggests that these mechanisms are fragile and
       hard to fix, particularly in the face of changes in the root
       zone.

   Scalability is a particular concern.  As of this writing, ICANN has
   plans to delegate up to 1,000 new TLDs per year as long as there is
   demand.  There is every reason to suppose that many of these will be
   IDNs, and that they will be aimed at communities that neither speak
   English nor even use Latin script, which means that volunteer-
   operated systems like publicsuffix.org will need a more diverse pool
   of volunteers.


3.  An analogy with anti-abuse systems

   The e-mail world has already struggled with the problem of mail
   senders communicating their policies, and has come up with mechanisms
   that publish records in the DNS in order to communicate those
   policies.  It seems that a similar approach might be useful for DNS
   systems themselves.

   In the e-mail technologies, the operator of a mail site publishes
   special records that are immediately below the name in question.  For
   DNS zone operators' policies, this approach will not work, because at

   least sometimes zone cuts will stand in the way of the places where
   one might like to put such information.  (In particular, where there
   are zone cuts and assertions about what happens on the other side of
   the cut, it is necessary to discover the policy on the other side is
   also.)  Moreover, it is not clear that the sort of information that
   would be most helpful would fit nicely in a single DNS RR.

   Nevertheless, the basic mechanism of performing some DNS queries in
   order to find the relevant administrative policies provides a way of
   anchoring the policy in the very technology for which the policy is
   desired.  That seems better than keeping such policies in a
   repository unlinked to the systems to which the policy applies.


4.  The Mechanism

   The proposed mechanism includes two elements:

   1.  a DNS RR to identify the policy document and a policy server;
   2.  a policy document that includes all the relevant policies for the
       zone in question, where that zone is determined by its SOA RR.


5.  Resource Records

   The operator of a zone that wishes to publish a policy document
   places a URI RR at the name _http._zpolicy at the location in the
   tree where the policy assertion is relevant.  In most cases, this
   will be immediately below the zone apex. [[anchor3: This could be an
   SRV record instead, if we're worried about the novelty of URI
   --ajs@anvilwalrusden.com]]


6.  Policy Document

   The operator of the zone provides, at the URIs in the _http._zpolicy
   RR, an XML document that provides the policy statements.  The
   document has a time to live that permits applications to cache it and
   continue using it over time.

   The policy document may include statements about the administrative
   boundaries in the domain, the repertoire of Unicode characters that
   the zone permits in U-labels, and the names of domains that may be
   considered alternatives for the purposes of operation of a given
   protocol.

Internet-Draft            Asserting Zone Policy               March 2012


6.1.  Administrative boundaries

   It is possible to use the mechanism to assert things about other
   zones.  For example, the policy document for example.com might make
   assertions about all names below example.com.  But the operator of
   independent.example.com might not want to follow the same policy.

   In order to determine whether there is agreement about policies
   across zone cuts, a policy checking client examines the
   _http._zpolicy record on the parent side of a zone cut, in order to
   ensure that there is agreement about the administrative boundaries.
   Similarly, when a policy document asserts coverage of another domain
   (not necessarily subordinate, the policy checking agent always looks
   up the _http._zpolicy record in the other domain as well.  In a
   subordinate domain, if the record does not exist, then the
   superordinate policy is in force.  In a domain in another part of the
   DNS name space, if the value of the URI is the same, then the policy
   is the same.

6.2.  Unicode Repertoire

   A policy may include a list of Unicode code points that are permitted
   characters in a U-label in that domain.  Such a list may also include
   mechanisms for determining alternative names that either must or may
   be used whenever the first Unicode code point exists (this is a label
   generation policy in support of IDN code point variants).  These
   mechanisms may be carried across zone cuts, but only with explicit
   inclusion in the subordinate zone's policy.  In the absence of a
   policy, it may be assumed that the domain has no rules about Unicode
   code point inclusion.  The existence of U-labels with code points
   outside the list should be taken as evidence of a failed policy.

6.3.  Alternative Names

   Sometimes the same service is offered at more than one DNS name.  For
   instance, the mail server at example.com and example.net might be the
   same, such that every localpart@example.com leads to the same mailbox
   as localpart@example.net.  Clients might find it convenient to be
   able to discover these relationships, and it is not possible to do so
   in the DNS.  A policy might include this data so that clients can
   discover it and so that servers may automatically configure
   themselves.

   In order for this to be safe, the tests in Section 6.1 need to be
   administered in order to ensure that one domain cannot make
   assertions about another domain.  In the absence of any policy

   [[anchor4: Question: should this require that the policy cover the

   zone -- i.e. that it be at the apex?  I used to think so, but I'm
   less convinced now. --ajs@anvilwalrusden.com]]


7.  Security Considerations

   Discuss the need to check across cuts to ensure that both sides
   agree.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The _zpolicy stuff needs to get registered.
