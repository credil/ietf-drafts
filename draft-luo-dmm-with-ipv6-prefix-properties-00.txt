 Distributed Mobility Management Approaches with IPv6 Prefix Properties
              draft-luo-dmm-with-ipv6-prefix-properties-00

Abstract

   This draft extends the existing PMIP-based mobility management
   protocol to support a more distributed model by introducing two new
   logical functions to enable distributed anchoring and location
   management.  Given the consideration that, the MN may not always
   require the mobility support that requires the use of the global
   prefix and additional network resources, this draft supports the
   option to leverage the extended properties of IPv6 prefixes source
   address selection hint (i.e.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol and
   its Prefix Information Option) to enable the UE's selection of IPv6
   prefix according to its service/application's mobility support
   requirement.  When the extended prefix properties feature is
   supported by the MN, this draft enable the MN to select the
   appropriate prefix according to the mechanism as described in
   [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties].  Once the IPv6 prefix is
   determined, the rest of the DMM mechanism is similar to the luo draft
   [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach].

1.  Introduction

   Centralized mobility anchoring imposes some limitations to the system
   such as single point of congestion and failure, non optimal routing
   etc. which are discussed in [I-D.liu-mext-distributed-mobile-ip].
   With the effect of social media phenomenon and the exponential growth
   of smart-phone devices (e.g. iPhone) with mobile applications that
   demand the real-time performance and high bandwidth, mobile and
   access network providers have trouble to keep up with such demands
   even with their aggressive deployment of more efficient and higher
   capacity mobile access networks (e.g. 4G and 802.11n-WLAN).  It comes
   to recognize that the centralized mobility anchoring model is no
   longer sufficient to handle the new traffic pattern happening in the
   internet and in private networks.  The objective of Distributed
   Mobility Management (DMM) is intended to mitigate those drawbacks,
   and the purpose of this draft is to present a PMIP-based extension
   for DMM support.

   This draft extends the existing PMIP-based mobility management
   protocol to support a more distributed model by introducing two new
   logical functions to enable distributed anchoring and location
   management.  Given the consideration that, the MN may not always
   require the mobility support that requires the use of the global
   prefix and additional network resources, this draft supports the
   option to leverage the extended properties of IPv6 prefixes source
   address selection hint (i.e.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol and
   its Prefix Information Option) to enable the UE's selection of IPv6
   prefix according to its service/application's mobility support
   requirement.  When the extended prefix properties feature is
   supported by the MN, this draft enable the MN to select the
   appropriate prefix according to the mechanism as described in
   [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties].  Once the IPv6 prefix is
   determined, the rest of the DMM mechanism is similar to the luo draft
   [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach].


2.  Solution Overview

   This draft introduces two new logic functions to the existing PMIP-
   based protocol to support the distributed mobility management:

   1.  Location Management Function (LMF) is designed to maintain the
       mappings between IP addresses and location of MNs.

   2.  Distributed Anchoring Function (DAF) is designed to provide the
       local anchoring support for the MN at its first hop router as
       described in luo draft [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach],
       section 7, which is referred as enhanced LMA (eLMA) with the

       similar property of the LMA as described in RFC[5213].

   DAF is composed of Distributed Routing sub-Function (DRF) and
   Distributed Mobility sub-Function (DMF).  The DRF operates as the
   distributed tunnel end-point at the first hop router of the MN to
   support the optimized routing between two DMM-capable end-points
   (i.e.  MN and its corresponding node, i.e. the CN).  DMF is designed
   to support the mobile node's mobility handover operation, with the
   intention to minimize the packet loss during the optimized route
   establishment.

   During the initial MN attachment, this draft re-uses an option to
   leverage korhonen draft [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties] to
   deliver source address selection hint of IPv6 prefixes to the MN
   (i.e. the 'M' flag in Prefix Information Option as defined in this
   draft).

   When eLMA detects an initial attachment of a MN, it will send a RA
   message to that MN.  The RA includes IPv6 prefixes, and each prefix
   is tagged with its properties which includes its mobility management
   property.  According to the mobility management property, the IPv6
   prefix is differentiated by the MN based on two categories, i.e.
   global prefix and local prefix and they are defined as follows:

   1.  Global Prefix: if an IPv6 address derived from a global prefix is
       used as source address for a session, this session will be
       provided with fully mobility support by using the mobility
       management mechanism specified in this draft.  That means, the
       address always remains valid even the point of attachment is
       changed.

   2.  Local Prefix: if an IPv6 address derived from a local prefix is
       used as source address for a session, no or limited mobility
       support will be provided for this session.  The address may not
       be valid when the point of attachment is changed.

   Based on the acquired mobility management property, MN supports its
   service applications according to these two categories of IPv6
   prefix.  If application on MN requires mobility support, the MN will
   derive an IPv6 address from the global prefix by having the
   application to invoke an appropriate socket API extension.
   Otherwise, the application on the MN requires no or limited mobility
   support, the MN will derive IPv6 address from local prefix by
   invoking another appropriate socket API extension.

   The network will not provide mobility for those local IPv6 prefixes,
   which implies when MN changes its point of attachment, i.e. eLMA, the
   local prefix assigned by previous eLMA will be

   deprecated\invalidated.  When attached to next eLMA, the new local
   prefix will be advertised by the new eLMA.

   eLMA only updates the location information to the LMF for those
   global prefixes.  Section 3.1 provides more detailed description.  If
   the MN does not support the extended prefix property features as
   described in [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties], the MN will derive
   the IPv6 address based on IPv6 global prefix.  If either the MN does
   not support this extended prefix property or the MN selects the
   global prefix, the DMM mechanisms as described in
   [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach] will leverage the global IPv6
   prefixes to maintain the mobility support for the MN for data
   forwarding and handoff operations and they are described as follows:

   a.  Data Forwarding: if the application on the MN requires mobility
       support (such as VOIP), it will leverages the IPv6 address
       derived from a global prefix to establish a session based on this
       global address as its source address with its CN.  When eLMA of
       the correspondent node receives traffic send to that global
       address, eLMA will query the LMF for the location information of
       that global address and forward the traffic based on the location
       information (e.g.  IP in IP tunnel).  Section 3.2 below provides
       more detailed descriptions.

   b.  Handoff: when MN changes its point of attachment from previous
       eLMA to next eLMA, the next eLMA will advertise the same global
       prefix to the MN over the new link and update new location
       information for that global prefix to the LMF for the purpose of
       maintaining the reachability of MN's global prefix.  Section 3.3
       below provides more detailed descriptions.


3.  Detailed Scenarios and Approaches

   As described above, the distributed anchor in this draft is referred
   as eLMA as shown in figures below.  Note that, although the MAG as
   defined in RFC[5213] is not shown in the figures below, one should
   aware that, the MAG could be co-located with the eLMA.

   Figure 1.  Initial Attach

   When eLMA1 detects an initial attachment of a mobile node, it sends a
   RA message to that mobile.  The RA includes two categories of
   prefixes, local prefix (PreA) and global prefix (PreB).  The eLMA
   should set PreA (i.e. local prefix) with high priority and PreB (i.e.
   global prefix) with low priority as according to
   [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties].

   The mobile node will derive its IPv6 addresses based on these two
   categories of IPv6 prefixes provided by the RA message.  The derived
   IPv6 addresses include local IPv6 address (IP1 in figure 1) and
   global IPv6 address (IP2 in figure 1).  Applications on the mobile
   node could select an appropriate IPv6 address as its source address
   as described in section 4 in [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties].

   Furthermore, the eLMA1 needs to perform the location update for the
   MN based on the MN's global prefix-to-location mapping info, i.e.
   {MN's global prefix, eLMA's IPv6 address}, for this particular mobile
   node to the LMF based on the mechanism introduced in section 7.2 of
   [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach].  Note that, the distributed
   anchor performs the location update only for the MN's global prefix.

   Figure 2.1 Data forwarding mechanism

   When correspondent node (CN) sends traffic to the mobile node, the
   traffic will arrive at CN's distributed anchor first (i.e. eLMA3 in
   figure 2.1).  Depending on the category of the destination IPv6
   address, eLMA3 will operate accordingly:

   1.  If the destination IPv6 address with local IPv6 prefix (IP1 in
       figure 2.1), eLMA3 will route the IP packet by using the generic
       IPv6 routing mechanism.

   2.  Otherwise, if the destination IPv6 address with global IPv6
       prefix (IP2 in figure 2.1), then eLMA3 will route this IP packet
       using routing mechanism as specified in section 7.2 of
       [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach].

   Figure 2.2 traffic between CN and MN, when destination is global IPv6
   address of MN, routing is optimized.

   As shown in figure 2.2, if the traffic from CN is sent to the mobile
   node's global IPv6 address (i.e.  IP2), the routing will be:
   CN-->eLMA3==>eLMA1-->MN which is based on optimized route.

   Note that, the tunnel between eLMA1 and eLMA3 is not per MN-CN pair,
   rather, it is a single tunnel between two distributed anchor peers.
   Any traffic between the MNs which are attached to these two peers
   will be routed over the same tunnel of which the tunnel is over an
   optimal routing path between the peers.

   Figure 3.1 Handover Scenario

   The handover between distributed anchors happens when the mobile node
   switches to a new distributed anchor, i.e. switching its anchor from
   eLMA1 to eLMA2 as shown in figure 3.1.  Once eLMA2 detects the
   attachment from the MN, it will send a RA which includes local
   prefix(es) and global prefix(es) to the mobile node and the handover
   operation is described as follows:

   a.  MN's local prefix assigned by the previous distributed anchor
       (PreA in figure 3.1) will be deprecated\invalidated.  In this
       case, the traffic which is sent to IP1 (configured from PreA)
       from CN will be discarded by the IPv6 routing system
       automatically; unless, a temporary tunnel between the previous
       and the next distributed anchors is setup to maintain the
       reachability to the previous local prefix.  Applications which
       rely on those local prefixes may suffer a change of source IP
       address.

   b.  New local prefix(es) (i.e.  PreC in figure 3.1) carried in the RA
       message and is assigned by eLMA2 is now have high priority.  The
       MN will derive a new IPv6 local address (IP3 in figure 3.1) for
       the PreC.

   c.  The global prefix(es) (i.e.PreB in figure 3.1) in the RA message
       remain the same global prefix(es) as assigned by eLMA1 which is
       the distributed anchor of this MN during its initial attachment.
       The eLMA2 shall perform the location update for the global
       prefixes of this MN based on the IPv6 address of eLMA2 to LMF to
       maintain the reachability of those global prefix(es).  The
       details for the handover can be reviewed in section 7.2 of
       [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach]

   Thus, after the handover, the mobile node can be reached either via
   its new local IPv6 address (i.e.  IP3) or via its global IPv6 address
   (i.e.  IP2); and if a temporary tunnel is present between eLMA1 and
   eLMA2, also be researchable via its previous local IPv6 address
   (i.e.IP1).

   It is the network policy to decide to maintain the reachability to
   the previous local prefix via a temporary tunnel between the previous
   distributed anchor and the next distributed anchor as described in
   section 4.4.2 of [I-D.korhonen-dmm-local-prefix] (Note that the
   distributed anchor refers to MAG in [I-D.korhonen-dmm-local-prefix]
   and eLMA in this draft).  Never-the-less, the purpose for such
   temporary tunnel to support service continuity when employing the
   local prefix is similar to the tunnel used by the global prefix for
   the mobility management purpose.

   As shown in figure 3.2, if the traffic from CN is sent to the mobile
   node's global IPv6 address (i.e.  IP2) after the handover, the
   routing will be: CN-->eLMA3==>eLMA2-->MN.  The routing is still
   optimized.
