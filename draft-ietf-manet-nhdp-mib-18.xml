      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
      the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
      accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects      
      in the MIB module are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
      Management Information (SMI). This document specifies a MIB module that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in 
      <xref target="RFC2578"/>,  
      <xref target="RFC2579"/> and  
      <xref target="RFC2580"/>.</t>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t><xref target="RFC6130"/> allows a router to discover and track topological information of routers up to two hops away by virtue of exchanging HELLO messages. This information is useful for routers running various routing and multicast flooding protocols developed within the IETF MANET Working Group.</t>

        <t>The following definitions apply throughout this document:</t>
        <t><list style='symbols'>
          <t>Notification Objects - triggers and associated notification             messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined            events on the managed router.</t>
          <t>Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are initialized to default settings or set through the management interface defined by this MIB module.</t>
          <t>State Objects - automatically generated values which            define the current operating state of the NHDP instance in the router.</t>
          <t>Performance Objects - automatically generated values             which help an administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the NHDP instance on the router and the overall discovery performance within the MANET.</t>
        </list></t>
      </section>    

      <section title="Notation">
        <t>The same notations as defined in [RFC6130] are used throughout this document.</t>

    </section>



    <section title="Structure of the MIB Module">
      <t>This section presents the structure of the NHDP-MIB module. 
         The MIB module is arranged into the following structure:</t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>
        <t>nhdpNotifications - objects defining NHDP-MIB notifications.</t>
        <t>nhdpObjects - defining objects within this MIB module.
           The objects are arranged into the following groups:
           <list style='symbols'>
              <t>Configuration Group - defining objects related to 
                 the configuration of the NHDP instance on the router.</t>
              <t>State Group - defining objects which reflect the current
                 state of the NHDP instance running on the router.</t>
              <t>Performance Group - defining objects which are 
                 useful to a management station when characterizing the
                 performance of NHDP on the router and in the MANET.</t>
           </list></t>
        <t>nhdpConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
           requirements for implementations of this MIB module.</t>
      </list></t>


	   <section title="Notifications">
      	<t>This section describes the use of notifications, and mechanisms to enhance the ability to manage NHDP routing domains.</t>
      	
         <section title="Introduction">
         	<t>Notifications can be emitted by a router running an instance of this specification as a reaction to a specific event. This allows a network manager to efficiently determine the source of problems or significant changes of configuration or topology, instead of polling a possibly large number of routers.</t>
         </section>
         
         <section title="Notification Generation">
         	<t>When an exception event occurs, the application notifies the local agent, which sends a notification to the appropriate SNMP management stations.  The message includes the notification type and may include a list of notification-specific variables.  <xref target="MIB"/> contains the notification definitions, which includes the variable lists. At least one IP address of the  router that originates the notification is included in the variable list so that the network manager may determine the source of the notification.</t>
         </section>
         
         <section title="Limiting Frequency of Notifications">
         	<t>To limit the frequency of notifications, the following additional   mechanisms are suggested, similar to those in <xref target="RFC4750"/>:</t>
             <section title="Ignoring Initial Activity">
             	<t>The majority of critical events occur when NHDP is first enabled on a router, at which time the symmetric neighbors and two-hop neighbors of the router are discovered. During this initial period, a potential flood of notifications is unnecessary since the events are expected. To avoid unnecessary notifications, a router SHOULD NOT originate expected notifications until a certain time interval has elapsed, which is to be predefined by the network manager. It is RECOMMENDED that this time interval is at least 3 x 'nhdpHelloInterval', so that symmetric neighbors are discovered. The suppression window for notifications is started when the 'nhdpIfStatus'
transitions from its default value of 'false(2)' to 'true(1)'</t>
             </section>
         
             <section title="Throttling Notifications">
             	<t>The mechanism for throttling the notifications is the same as in <xref target="RFC4750"/> (i.e. the amount of transmitted notifications per time is bounded).</t>

  		<t>Appropriate values for the window time and upper bound are to be selected by the network manager and depend on the deployment of the MANET. If NHDP is deployed on a lossy, wireless medium, sending too many notifications in a short time interval may lead to collisions and dropped packets. In particular, in dense deployments of routers running NHDP (i.e. where each router has many neighbors), a change of the local topology may trigger many notifications at the same time. <xref target="RFC4750"/> recommends "7 notifications with a window time of 10 seconds" as the upper bound. As NHDP is expected to be deployed in more
lossy channels than OSPF, it is RECOMMENDED to choose a lower threshold for the number of notifications per time than that. Specifically it is RECOMMENDED to choose a threshold value for the objects reflecting the change be set to a value of '10' and have set the DEFAULT values for these objects within the Notifications Group to this value. Further, a time window for the change objects is defined within this MIB module. It is RECOMMENDED that if the number of occurrences exceeds the change threshold within the previous change window,
then the notification is to be sent. Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that the value for this window be set to at least 5 times the 'nhdpHelloInterval'.</t>
  		
  		
  		<t>The following objects are used to define the thresholds and time
windows for specific Notifications defined in the NHDP-MIB module: 'nhdpNbrStateChangeThreshold', 'nhdpNbrStateChangeWindow',  'nhdp2HopNbrStateChangeThreshold', 'nhdp2HopNbrStateChangeWindow',  'nhdpIfRxBadPacketThreshold', 'nhdpIfRxBadPacketWindow'.</t>
             </section>
         
             <section title="One Notification per Event">
             	<t>Similar to the mechanism in <xref target="RFC4750"/>, only one notification is sent per event.</t>
             </section>
         </section>
      </section>



      <section title="The Configuration Group">
        <t>The router running NHDP is configured with a set of controls. The authoritative list of configuration controls within the NHDP-MIB module are found within the MIB module itself. Generally, an attempt was made in developing the NHDP-MIB module to support all configuration objects defined in <xref target="RFC6130"/>. For all of the configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of these parameters as defined in <xref target="RFC6130"/> are followed.  Refer to <xref target="RFC5148"/> for guidance on setting jitter related parameters, e.g., nhdpMaxJitter.</t>
      </section>



      <section title="The State Group">
        <t>The State Group reports current state information of a router running NHDP. The NHDP-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain the complete set of state information defined within the information bases specified in Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 of <xref target="RFC6130"/>.</t>

        <t>Two constructs, i.e., TEXTUAL CONVENTIONs, are defined to support 
           of the tables in the State Group. 
           NHDP stores and indexes information through sets
           of (dynamically defined) addresses, i.e., address sets.  
           Within SMIv2 it is not possible to
           index tables with variably defined address sets.  Hence, these TEXTUAL
           CONVENTIONS are defined to provide a local mapping between NHDP
           managed address sets and SMIv2 table indexing.
           These constructs are the NeighborIfIndex and NeighborRouterIndex.  
           These are locally (to the router) defined, unique identifiers
           of virtual neighbors and neighbor interfaces. 

           Due to the nature of NHDP, the local router may have identified distinct address
           sets but is not able to associate these as a single interface.  Hence,
           two or more NeighborIfIndexes pointing to multiple distinct address sets
           may in fact be related to a common neighbor interface.  This ambiguity
           may also hold with respect to the assignment of the NeighborRouterIndex.
           The local MIB agent is responsible for managing, aggregating and
           retiring the defined indexes, and in updating MIB tables using these
           indexes as the local router learns more about its neighbors'
           topology.
 
           These constructs are used to define indexes to the appropriate State Group tables and 
           to correlate table entries to address sets, virtual neighbor interfaces and 
           virtual neighbors
           within the MANET.</t>
      </section>


      <section anchor="perf_group" title="The Performance Group">
        <t>The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance. Unstable neighbors or 2-hop neighbors and frequent changes 
           of sets can have a negative influence on the performance of NHDP. 
        This MIB module defines several objects that can be polled in order to, e.g., calculate histories or monitor frequencies of changes. This may help the network administrator to determine unusual topology changes or other changes that affect stability and reliability of the MANET. One such framework is specified in <xref target="REPORT-MIB"/>.</t>    
      </section>
      
      


    <section title="Tables and Indexing">
      <t>The NHDP-MIB module contains a number of tables which record
         data related to:
      </t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>  
         <t>the local router,</t> 
         <t>a local MANET interface on the router,</t>  
         <t>other routers which are 1-hop removed from the local router,</t>  
         <t>interfaces on other routers which are 1-hop removed from the
            local router, and</t> 
         <t>other routers which are 2-hop removed from the local router.</t> 
      </list></t>

      <t>The NHDP-MIB module's tables are indexed via the following constructs:
      </t>
      <t><list style='symbols'>  
         <t>nhdpIfIndex - which is the IfIndex of the local router on which
            NHDP is configured.</t> 
         <t>nhdpDiscIfIndex - a locally managed index representing a known
            interface on a neighboring router.</t> 
         <t>nhdpDiscRouterIndex - a locally managed index representing an
            ID of a known neighboring router.</t> 
         <!--<t>nhdpIPAddressType and nhdpIpAddress pair - for tables containing
            address lists.</t> -->
      </list></t>

      <t>These tables and their indexing are:

      <section title="Relationship to Other MIB Modules">
         <t>This section specifies the relationship of the MIB module contained in this document to other standards, particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are identified in this section.</t>


          <section title="Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB">
            <t>The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB module <xref target="RFC3418"/> is defined as being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a whole. The 'system' group provides identification of the management entity and certain other system-wide data. The NHDP-MIB module does not duplicate those objects.</t>
          </section>


          <section title="Relationship to Routing Protocol MIB Modules Relying on the NHDP-MIB Module">
            <t><xref target="RFC6130"/> allows routing protocols to rely on the neighborhood information that is discovered by means of HELLO message exchange. In order to allow for troubleshooting, fault isolation, and management of such routing protocols through a routing protocol MIB module, it may be desired to align the State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB module and the routing protocol MIB module. This is accomplished through the definition of two TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS in the NHDP-MIB module: the NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterIndex.  These object types are used to develop indexes into common NHDP-MIB module and routing protocol State Group tables. These objects are locally significant but should be locally common to the NHDP-MIB module and the routing protocol MIB module implemented on a common networked router. This will allow for improved cross referencing of information across the two MIB modules.</t>

--
-- Textual Conventions
--
   -- Two new Textual Conventions have been defined in 
   -- this MIB module for indexing into the following
   -- tables and indexing into other tables in other MIB modules.
   -- This was necessary because NHDP manages and
   -- indexes based upon dynamic address tuples, i.e.,
   -- address sets, while SMI requires statically
   -- defined indexes for accessing its table rows.
   -- The NeighborIfIndex defines a unique (to the local router)
   -- index referencing a discovered virtual interface on another
   -- neighbor within the MANET. The NeighborRouterIndex defines a
   -- unique (to the local router) index referencing a discovered
   -- virtual neighbor within the MANET.  
   --
   -- Due to the nature of NHDP,
   -- different indexes may be related to common neighbor
   -- interfaces or common neighbor routers, but the information 
   -- obtained through NHDP has not allowed the local router
   -- to relate these virtual objects (i.e., interfaces or routers)
   -- at this point in time.  As more topology information
   -- is gathered by the local router, it may associate
   -- virtual interfaces or routers and collapse these
   -- indexes appropriately.

   -- Multiple addresses can be associated with a
   -- given NeighborIfIndex.  Each NeighborIfIndex is
   -- associated with a NeighborRouterIndex.  Throughout
   -- the nhdpStateObjGroup, the
   -- NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterIndex are used
   -- to define the set of IpAddrs related to a virtual 
   -- neighbor interface or virtual neighbor under discussion.

    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An arbitrary, locally unique identifier associated with a
        virtual interface of a discovered NHDP neighbor.
        Due to the nature of NHDP, the local router 
        may not know if two distinct addresses belong to the 
        same interface of a neighbor or to two different 
        interfaces.  As the local router gains more
        knowledge of its neighbors, its local view may change and 
        this table will be updated to reflect the local router's current
        understanding associating address sets to neighbor interfaces.
        The local router identifies a virtual neighbor interface through 
        the receipt of address lists advertised through an 
        NHDP HELLO message.  
        
        All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent
        out of a common number space.

        The value for each discovered virtual neighbor 
        interface may not remain constant from 
        one re-initialization of the entity's network management 
        agent to the next re-initialization.  If the
        local router gains information associating two virtual
        interfaces on a neighbor as a common interface, 
        then the agent MUST aggregate the two address sets to 
        a single index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes, 
        and it MUST update all tables in this 
        MIB module which are indexed by indexes
        of type NeighborIfIndex.  It MAY then reuse freed 
        index values following the next agent restart.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity."

NeighborRouterIndex ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "d"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An arbitrary, locally unique identifier associated with a
        virtual discovered neighbor (one or two hop).  Due to the 
        nature of NHDP, the local router may identify 
        multiple virtual neighbors  which in fact are one and 
        the same.  Neighbors that are two hops away with more than 
        one advertised address will exhibit this behavior.  As the
        local router's knowledge of its neighbors' topology
        increases, the local router will be able to associate
        multiple virtual neighbor indexes into a single virtual
        neighbor index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes,
        it MUST update all tables in this MIB module indexed by these
        indexes, and it MAY reuse the freed indexes following the
        next agent re-initialization.

        All objects of type NeighborRouterIndex are assigned by
        the agent out of a common number space.

        The NeighborRouterIndex defines a discovered NHDP peer
        virtual neighbor of the local router.
        The value for each discovered virtual neighbor index MUST remain
        constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
        network management agent to the next re-initialization, except
        that if an application is deleted and re-created.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
        entity. An NeighborRouterIndex value MUST not be re-used 
        until the next agent restart."

           As such, this table 'sparse augments' the ifTable
           specifically when NHDP is to be configured to
           operate over this interface.  The interface is
           identified by the ifIndex from the interfaces
           group defined in the Interfaces Group MIB module.
 
           A conceptual row in this table exists if and only
           if either a manager has explicitly created the row
           or there is an interface on the managed device
           that supports and runs NHDP. 

           The manager can create a row by setting
           rowStatus to 'createAndGo' or 'createAndWait'.
           Row objects having associated DEFVAL clauses are
           automatically defined by the agent with these
           values during row creation, unless the manager
           explicitly defines these object values during the
           row creation.

           If the corresponding entry with ifIndex value
           is deleted from the Interface Table, then the entry
           in this table is automatically deleted and
           NHDP is disabled on this interface,
           and all configuration and state information

           from memory."

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This MIB module defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and
         notification of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol <xref target="RFC6130"/>. 
         NHDP allows routers to acquire topological information up to two hops away 
         by virtue of exchanging HELLO messages. The information acquired by NHDP 
         may be used by routing protocols. The neighborhood information, exchanged 
         between routers using NHDP, serves these routing protocols as a baseline 
         for calculating paths to all destinations in the MANET, relay set selection 
         for network-wide transmissions etc.</t>

      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
         with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
         may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
         The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
         proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
         These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

          <t>nhdpIfStatus - this writable object turns on or off the NHDP
             process for the specified interface.  If disabled, higher level
             protocol functions, e.g., routing, would fail causing
             network-wide disruptions.</t>

          <t>nhdpHelloInterval, nhdpHelloMinInterval, and nhdpRefreshInterval
             - these writable objects control the rate at which HELLO messages 
             are sent on an interface. If set at too high a rate, 
             this could represent a form of DOS attack by overloading interface 
             resources.</t>

          <t>nhdpHystAcceptQuality, nhdpHystRejectQuality, nhdpInitialQuality,
             nhdpInitialPending - these writable objects affect the perceived 
             quality of the NHDP links and hence the overall stability of the network.  
             If improperly set, these settings could result in network-wide disruptions.</t>

          <t>nhdpInterfaceTable - this table contains writable objects that affect 
             the overall performance and stability of the NHDP process.  
             Failure of the NHDP process would result in network-wide failure.  
             Particularly sensitive objects from this table are discussed 
             in the previous list items. This is the only table in the 
             NHDP-MIB module with writable objects.</t>
        </list></t>


      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
         MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
         vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
         even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
         encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
         via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
         sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         <list style="symbols">
          <t>nhdpDiscIfSetTable - The object contains information on discovered neighbors,
             specifically their IP address in the nhdpDiscIfSetIpAddr object. 
             This information provides an adversary broad information on the 
             members of the MANET, located within this single table.  
             This information can be used to expedite attacks on the other members 
             of the MANET without having to go through a laborious discovery 
             process on their own. This object is the index into the table, 
             and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-accessible'. However, this information 
             can be exposed using SNMP operations.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of 
         emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these 
         applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of the
         communications network and to protect sensitive information related 
         to its operation.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to provide support 
         for the Transport Security Model (TSM) <xref target="RFC5591"></xref> 
         in combination with TLS/DTLS <xref target="RFC6353"/>.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
         Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
         there is no control as to who on the secure network is
         allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
         in this MIB module.</t>

      <t>Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
         SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref> ), including full support for
         authentication and confidentiality via the User-based Security Model (USM)
         <xref target="RFC3414"></xref>  
         with the AES cipher algorithm <xref target="RFC3826"></xref>.  
         Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
         <xref target="RFC5591"></xref> in combination with a secure transport such as 
         SSH <xref target="RFC5592"></xref> or 
         TLS/DTLS <xref target="RFC6353"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
         RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
         cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to 
         ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
         module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
         those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
         SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

    <section title="Applicability Statement">
      <t>This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
         Neighborhood Discovery Protocol <xref target="RFC6130"/>
         process on a router.  
         This MIB module, denoted NHDP-MIB, 
         also reports state, performance information and notifications.
         This sections provides some examples of how this MIB module can be used in
         MANET network deployments.
         A fuller discussion of MANET network management use cases and
         challenges will be provided elsewhere.
      </t>

      <t>NHDP is designed to allow  routers to automatically discover and track routers one hop remote (denoted "neighbors"), and routers two hops remote (denoted "two-hop neighbors).  This information is used by other MANET protocols
         in operation on the router to perform
         routing, multicast forwarding and other functions with ad-hoc and 
         mobile networks.
         In the following, three scenarios are listed where this MIB module is useful, i.e.,
      </t>

      <t><list style='symbols'>
            <t>For a Parking Lot Initial Configuration Situation - it is common for
               the vehicles comprising the
               MANET being forward deployed at a remote location, e.g., the site of
               a natural disaster, to be off-loaded in a parking lot where an initial configuration
               of the networking devices is performed.  The configuration is loaded into the
               devices from a fixed location Network Operation Center (NOC) at the parking lot and the
               vehicles are stationary at the parking lot while the configuration changes are made.
               Standards-based
               methods for configuration management from the co-located NOC
               are necessary for this deployment option.
               </t>
            <t>For Mobile vehicles with Low Bandwidth Satellite Link to a Fixed NOC - Here
               the vehicles carrying the MANET routers carry multiple wireless interfaces, one of
               which is a relatively low-bandwidth on-the-move satellite connection which interconnects
               a fix NOC to the nodes of the MANET.
               Standards-based
               methods for monitoring and fault management from the fixed NOC
               are necessary for this deployment option. </t>
            <t>For Fixed NOC and Mobile Local Manager in Larger Vehicles - for larger
               vehicles, a hierarchical network management arrangement is useful.  Centralized
               network management is performed from a fixed NOC while local management is performed
               locally from within the vehicles.
               Standards-based
               methods for configuration, monitoring and fault management
               are necessary for this deployment option. </t>
