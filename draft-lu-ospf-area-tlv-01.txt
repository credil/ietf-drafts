Abstract

   For multi-area path computation, it is desirable to have knowledge of
   area boundaries and the corresponding border routers which are
   capable of processing inter-area TE traffic.  This memo defines a TLV
   to the OSPF TE extensions to meet such need.

Internet-Draft       OSPF TE Extension for Area IDs            July 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   Traffic Engineering (TE) based networks are widely used by network
   operators.  The provision and setup mechanisms work fine in a single
   IGP area thanks to the well defined TE extensions to the
   corresponding protocols, namely RSVP-TE [RFC3209], OSPF-TE [RFC3630],
   and ISIS-TE [RFC3784].  From the single area TE database, LSPs can be
   derived to meet various TE constraints using some Path Computation
   Element (PCE) methods such as CSPF.

   The mechanisms however cannot be applied directly to multi-area
   networks, for which the path computation is one of the key
   applications of the PCE-based architecture [RFC4655].

   It is highly desirable to compute inter-area shortest paths that
   satisfy some bandwidth constraints or any other constraints, with
   little manual intervention, as is possible within a single IGP area.

1.2.  Current Solutions

   Listed below are a few existing inter-area path computation
   mechanisms.  As can be seen the ABR whereabouts are indispensable in
   computing inter-area LSPs.

1.2.1.  Global TED

   A single TE database that contains all TE information of each and
   every area/domain is called the global TED.  This certainly makes it
   easy to compute shortest path LSPs that meet all constraint
   requirements.  The drawbacks nevertheless are apparent:

   a.  IGP hierarchy enables improved IGP scalability by dividing the
       IGP domain into areas and limiting the flooding scope of topology
       information to within area boundaries.  The global TED goes
       against this principle.

   b.  Even if one is willing to compromise this principle, the LSPs
       created upon this global TED would lack of area information which
       may be required for enforcing path selection policies.

1.2.2.  Stitch

   This method uses per-area path computation based on ERO expansion on
   the head-end LSR and on ABRs.  ABRs can be selected through either:

Internet-Draft       OSPF TE Extension for Area IDs            July 2011


   a.  Static configuration of ABRs as loose hops at the head-end LSR;

   b.  Dynamic ABR selection - Proprietary, knowledge of ABRs may be
       aquired through non-standard protocol modification.

1.2.3.  Crankback

   Crankback method defined in [RFC4920] allows an LSP to be constructed
   to beyond the area scope provided some intermediate nodes, i.e.
   ABRs, are known.  Crankback can probe the ABRs one after another till
   a viable path is found if it exists.

   Note that this method does not allow computing an optimal path but
   just a feasible path.  It may also have some non-negligible setup
   delay.  These issues nevertheless are beyond the scope of this
   document.

1.2.4.  Distributed Path Computation

   PCE architecture document [RFC4655] outlines a distributed PCE
   architecture.  The idea is that various PCEs which have partial
   information of the topologies work together to conclude the best
   paths that meet the computation constraint requirements.

   Individual PCEs may not have any visibility beyond the areas they are
   servicing.  For inter-area path computation purpose, the knowledge of
   ABRs are essential for the neighboring PCEs to find out the overall
   best path over the combined areas.

   BRPC as defined in [RFC5441] provides one of such methods.  OSPF-CAP
   [RFC5088] on the other hand defines methods to make known distributed
   PCEs using OSPF capability TLVs.

   Note that although [RFC5088] contains PCE-DOMAIN sub-TLV for OSPF
   Area ID, it however cannot be used for identifying area border LSRs.
   It is for locating PCEs, not LSRs.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Definitions

   The following definitions are under the context where TE is enabled.

2.1.  Exit Area

   A neighboring OSPF area to which an inter-area path can possibly be
   extended is called Exit Area.

   The ABR which connects the current area to an Exit Area is called
   exit ABR.

2.2.  TE-ABR

   An exit ABR is also referred to as TE-ABR.

3.  Motivation

3.1.  The importance of ABR whereabouts

   All solutions listed in Section 1.2, except the global TED approach,
   have to use the knowledge of exit ABRs to accomplish their inter-area
   path computation tasks.

   Some methods require manual configuration which is costly and error
   prone.  Others may have to use proprietary means to acquire the
   information.

   It is desirable to have the exit ABR information available and make
   it conveniently accessible to the relevant PCEs without adding lot of
   complexity to the protocols nor too much burden to the participating
   routers.

3.2.  Topic not Yet Addressed

   Apart from the manual provision, currently the exit ABR information
   is difficult to acquire.  The reasons are:

   1.  OSPF TE Database (TED) does not contain information on exit ABRs;

   2.  CSPF operates on the TED and is therefore limited to the
       information the latter provides.  Unless the critical information
       of the exit ABRs becomes available, the CSPF cannot operate
       optimally by seeing beyond the area scope.

   3.  One may argue that CSPF can dig into OSPF's other repositories,
       such as LSDB, to find out the ABR whereabouts.  This is not
       advisable because it negates the purpose of keeping TED opque and
       independent from the normal OSPF operation.  This is also
       technically difficult because usually CSPF and OSPF are two
       different processes that they may not be running in the same
       nodes.

   4.  Even if one is willing for CSPF to intrude into OSPF space, and
       use the ABR bit (B bit) information for locating border routers,
       these ABRs are not necessarily the exit ABRs.  In other words,
       even if CSPF learns which routers sit on area borders, it is
       still unable to ascentain whether the ABRs are supporting TE on
       the other side of the borders.  OSPF's hierarchical design limits
       the topology sharing to within area boundaries.

   5.  And even if one is willing to jump across this limit and somehow
       manages to aquire the ABRs' TE ability onto other areas, there is
       still the need for one more key information, the Area IDs.

Internet-Draft       OSPF TE Extension for Area IDs            July 2011


   6.  The Area IDs are critical to the distributed PCE architecture.
       They are essential in enforcing path computation area sequences
       and PCE policies.  They are also useful for consolidating path
       computation jobs.  Section 6.2 provides an example of ABR
       consolidation.

   7.  It is important to understand that the proposed TLV also implies
       TE capabilities.  In other words the TLV signifies that the
       advertising router is not only an ABR, but also an LSR capable of
       handling TE traffic.  Unless tied with TE knowledge, methods of
       discovering of ABRs will not be useful in locating TE-ABRs, i.e.
       the LSRs that can transit TE traffic across areas.

   8.  At last, since the TLV is TE based, it should be defined in the
       OSPF TE extensions and maintained similarly with its
       counterparts, Router Address TLV and Link TLV.

3.3.  Benefits

   The benefits of having an OSPF Area ID TLV are listed below:

   1.  It fits into OSPF TE architecture, preserves the protocol's
       hierarchy, and adds little burden to the OSPF process;

   2.  It automates the TE-ABR discovery, and eliminates the need of
       manual provisioning;

   3.  Very often an LSR is also a PCE.  If this LSR is also an ABR, it
       can compute a two-area LSP effortlessly.  The PCC only needs to
       send the request to one TE-ABR (if there are multiple TE-ABRs
       sharing the same border), provided it has knowledge of the TE-ABR
       whereabouts.


4.  Scope of the proposal

   This document describes solutions for inter-area path computation and
   does not address inter-domain scenarios.

   It is also specific to OSPF as an IGP protocol, though the concepts
   apply to ISIS which are to be defined in a separate document.


5.  Area ID TLV

   [RFC3630] section 2.4 defines two TLVs.  This memo adds a third TLV
   called the Area ID TLV.

5.1.  TLV Origination Point

   The Area ID TLV is originated and maintained by TE-ABR routers.  The
   TLV is encoded in an OSPF TE LSA which is an area-opaque LSA, and
   handled the same way as the TE-LINK TLV and TE-ROUTER-ADDRESS TLV.
   This TLV is flooded throughout and within the originating area.

   In Figure 1 for example, it is assumed all ABRs and areas are TE
   enabled.  For ABR1 and ABR2, since they sit between Area0 and Area1,
   both will originate an Area ID TLV concerning Area1 and flood it into
   Area0, and vice versa.  Likewise, ABR3 will originate a TLV covering
   Area2, Area3, and Area4, and flood it into Area0, and so on for
   Area2, Area3 and Area4.

                           Figure 2: TLV Format

   Type   The Area ID TLV consists of a 1-octet type value which will be
          allocated by the IANA (suggested value 3).

   Len    1-octet unsigned integer value 4xN to represent N exit areas,
          not including the originating area.

   Value  The value fields contains one or more Area IDs.  Each Area ID
          is a four-octet OSPF Area ID associated with an exit area for
          which the ABR has TE enabled.  An ABR may connect to multiple
          areas.  Therefore it may generate 1 TLV with N IDs, where N is
          the total number of exit areas, not including the originating
          area.  Since the Len field is of 1-octet, this TLV can hold
          upto 63 IDs.  For non-ABR routers this Area-ID TLV SHOULD not
          occur.

5.3.  Example

   Consider Figure 1 again.  Router ABR3 connects to four areas Area0,
   Area2, Area3, and Area4.  Assuming all ABRs and areas are TE enabled
   except Area4 which is not TE-enabled.  ABR3 originates and floods
   following Area-ID TLVs as shown in Figure 3, assuming type is 3.

                           Figure 4: Use-Case 1

   The topology is shown in Figure 4.  The headend "H" is in Area1.  The
   tailend "T" is in Area0.  LSRs are running OSPF-TE and RSVP-TE.

6.1.1.  Crankback approach

   The crankback method requires a list of ABRs for tryout.  The list
   usually has to be provisioned manually.

   With the proposed Area-ID TLVs, the ABR information is made available
   through the OSPF TE database.  Therefore "H" learns the ABR list
   dynamically from its OSPF TED, which is ABR1 and ABR2.  "H" starts
   the crankback procedure with "ABR1" from which it reaches "T".  The
   LSP thus is established successfully, though not necessarily optimal.

6.1.2.  BRPC approach

   With the method defined in [RFC5441], the VSPT has to be first built
   from "T" in Area0.  Given that the area sequence is Area0->Area1, the
   initial VSPT has the candidate exit ABRs ABR1, ABR2, and ABR3.

Internet-Draft       OSPF TE Extension for Area IDs            July 2011


   Now with the proposed OSPF Area ID TLVs the PCE of Area0 knows that
   ABR3 connects Area2, not Area1, therefore ABR3 is not considered as
   an exit ABR.

   Subsequently the PCE of Area1 takes the VSPT passed by the PCE of
   Area0 as input and concludes the end-to-end path computation.

6.2.  Use-Case 2

   Very often an LSR is also a PCE.  In that case, the Area ID TLVs can
   make the path computation job more efficient.

                         |          ABR1  Area1   |
                         |    H      ||           |
                         |          ABR2   T      |
                         |   Area0   ||           |
                         |          ABR3          |
                         |           | -----------
                         |           ||           |
                         |          ABR4  Area2   |
                         |           ||           |
                          -----------  -----------

                           Figure 5: Use-Case 2

   As shown in Figure 5, if the headend "H" knows that the tailend "T",
   or some intermediate node to reach, is in Area1, it sends a PCReq to
   one of the ABRs that connect to Area1.  The draft proposal makes the
   ABR list conveniently available, which is [ABR1, ABR2, ABR3].  Note
   that ABR4 is not listed since it is not an exit ABR to Area1.

   Assuming by some local policy ABR1 is chosen.  Since ABR1 sits across
   Area0 and Area1, it has visibility to TEDs of both areas.  ABR1 which
   is also a PCE performs the path computation job in the same way as an
   intra-area path computation.

   Note that the resulting path, if existent, does not necessarily go
   through ABR1.  It can be for example H->ABR3->T.

   Note also that the ABR selection is a local decision.  One can use
   some criteria, for example the highest te-router-id, to select the
   ABR.  However, the candidate ABRs have to share the common border
   such as the one between Area0 and Area1.  This can be achieved by
   grouping ABRs according to their exit Area IDs in the proposed OSPF
   Area ID TLVs.
