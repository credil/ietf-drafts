Abstract

   This document proposes a method by which in a VXLAN environment the
   ARP tables of each VTEP having an active VM belonging to a particular
   tenant where such active VMs are distributed amongst several VTEPs in
   a data center or across data centers are walked through and the
   collation of the location of such active VMs and the VTEPs they are
   located in is found for management and network resource planning
   purposes.

INTERNET DRAFT       VM topology discovery in VXLAN           March 2012


1  Introduction

   It will be necessary in a VXLAN data center environment to locate the
   several active VMs belonging to one or more tenants or all tenants
   which are hosted by the VTEPs in the data center and list the active
   VMs such that management and network resource planning can be done
   for that tenant. This information may be useful to the network
   administrators of the data center deploying VXLAN and to the tenants
   that have their active VMs hosted in the data center running VXLAN
   for the mentioned purposes.


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


1.2  Methodology



   The following IP Address Translation table also called the ARP table
   as outlined in RFC 2011 will be useful in this method. It is possible
   that several IP sub-nets are deployed for a given tenant. For each
   such IP sub-net there may be a VLAN allocated. For routing between
   such IP sub-nets the default gateway for a VLAN that has its VNICs in
   several such VLANs may be deployed. In such a case the ARP tables of
   each of the interfaces of then active VM default gateway for the
   several VLANs involved is inspected to collate the different VLAN's
   active VMs that are hosted on the VTEPs in the VXLAN based data
   center. The algorithm that does this specific job of collation is
   explained in section 1.2.1.

   -- the IP Address Translation table

   -- The Address Translation tables contain the IpAddress to
   -- "physical" address equivalences.  Some interfaces do not
   -- use translation tables for determining address
   -- equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method);
   -- if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address
   -- Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.

               identified with said entry.  It is an implementation-
               specific matter as to whether the agent removes an
               invalidated entry from the table.Accordingly, management
               stations must be prepared to receive tabular information
               from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in
               use.  Proper interpretation of such entries requires
               examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object."

2. Applicability to NMS Applications

   Network Management Applications can provide a friendly user interface
   where the topology of the Layer 3 transport network with the TORs and
   respective VTEPs under them can be discovered using regular Layer 3
   topology discovery. The algorithm in 1.2.1 can then be executed and
   the active VMs of various tenants displayed. This will help in
   management and in network resource planning.

2.1 VTEP support

   VTEPs in the VXLAN environment in data centers are expected to have
   SNMP support in the form of MIBs as per [2011].
