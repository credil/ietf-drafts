              draft-ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements-06.txt

Abstract

   This document presents a set of requirements and a framework for
   providing a Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire (PW) over MPLS PSNs.  The
   requirements identified in this document are related to architecture,
   signaling and maintenance aspects of Point-to-Multipoint PW
   operation.  They are proposed as guidelines for the standardization
   of such mechanisms.  Among other potential applications, Point-to-
   Multipoint PWs can be used to optimize the support of multicast layer
   2 services (Virtual Private LAN Service and Virtual Private Multicast
   Service) as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual Private Network Working
   Group.

Internet-Draft            P2MP PW Requirements              October 2013


1.1.  Problem Statement

   As defined in the pseudowire architecture [RFC3985], a Pseudowire
   (PW) is a mechanism that emulates the essential attributes of a
   telecommunications service (such as a T1 leased line or Frame Relay)
   over an IP or MPLS PSN.  It provides a single service which is
   perceived by its user as an unshared link or circuit of the chosen
   service.  A Pseudowire is used to transport layer 1 or layer 2
   traffic (e.g. Ethernet, TDM, ATM, and FR) over a layer 3 PSN.  PWE3
   operates "edge to edge" to provide the required connectivity between
   the two endpoints of the PW.

   The Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) topology described in
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpms-frmwk-requirements] and required to provide P2MP
   L2VPN services can be achieved using one or more P2MP PWs.  The use
   of PW encapsulation enables P2MP services transporting layer 1 or
   layer 2 data.  This could be achieved using a set of point to point
   PWs, with traffic replication on the PE, but at the cost of bandwidth
   efficiency, as duplicate traffic would be carried multiple times on
   shared links.

   This document defines the requirements for a Point-to-Multipoint PW
   (P2MP PW).  A P2MP PW is a mechanism that emulates the essential
   attributes of a P2MP Telecommunications service such as a P2MP ATM VC
   over a PSN.  The required functions of P2MP PWs include encapsulating
   service-specific PDUs arriving at an ingress Attachment Circuit (AC),
   and carrying them across a tunnel to one or more egress ACs, managing
   their timing and order, and any other operations required to emulate
   the behavior and characteristics of the service as faithfully as
   possible.

   P2MP PWs therefore extend the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985] to offer a
   P2MP Telecommunications service.

   This document also defines the associated requirements related to the
   P2MP PW operation (e.g. setup and maintenance, protection and
   scalability).

1.2.  Scope of This Document

   The document describes the P2MP PW Reference Model architectures and
   outlines specific signaling requirements for the set up and
   maintenance of a P2MP PW.  In this document, the requirements focus
   on the Single-Segment PW model.  It is for further study how it
   should be realized in Multi-Segment PW model.  For other aspects of
   P2MP PW implementation, such as packet processing (section 4) and
   Faithfulness of Emulated Services (section 7), the document refers to
   [RFC3916].

   Some P2MP PW requirements are derived from the signaling requirements
   for P2MP Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths [RFC4461].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .

2.1.  Acronyms

      P2P: Point-to-Point
      P2MP: Point-to-Multipoint
      PW: Pseudowire
      PSN: Packet Switched Network
      SS-PW: Single-Segment Pseudowire
      MS-PW: Multi-Segment Pseudowire

2.2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology described in [RFC5659].  It also
   introduces additional terms needed in the context of P2MP PW.

   P2MP PW, (also referred as PW Tree):
         Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire.  A PW attached to a source CE
         used to distribute Layer 1 or Layer 2 traffic to a set of one
         or more receiver CEs.  The P2MP PW is unidirectional and
         optionally bidirectional.
   P2MP SS-PW:
         Point-to-Multipoint Single-Segment Pseudowire.  A single
         segment P2MP PW set up between the PE attached to the source CE
         and the PEs attached to the receiver CEs.  The P2MP SS-PW uses
         P2MP LSPs as PSN tunnels.  The requirements in this document is
         targeted for SS-PW model.  Application of MS-PW (Multi-segment
         PW) model [RFC5254] is out of scope and left for future work.
   Root PE:
         P2MP PW Root Provider Edge.  The PE attached to the traffic
         source CE for the P2MP PW via an Attachment Circuit (AC).
   Leaf PE:
         P2MP PW Leaf Provider Edge.  A PE attached to a set of one or
         more traffic receiver CEs, via ACs.  The Leaf PE replicates
         traffic to the CEs based on its Forwarder function [RFC3985].
   P2MP PSN Tunnel:
         In the P2MP SS-PW topology, The PSN Tunnel is a general term
         indicating a virtual P2MP connection between the Root PE and
         the Leaf PEs.  A P2MP tunnel may potentially carry multiple

         P2MP PWs inside (aggregation).  This document uses terminology
         from the document describing the MPLS multicast architecture
         [RFC5332] for MPLS PSN.

3.  P2MP PW Requirements

3.1.  Reference Model

   As per the definition of [RFC3985], a pseudowire (PW) both originates
   and terminates on the edge of the same packet switched network (PSN).
   The PW label is unchanged between the originating and terminating
   provider edges (PEs).  This is also known as a single-segment
   pseudowire (SS-PW), as the most fundamental network model of PWE3.

   P2MP PW can be defined as Point-to-Multipoint connectivity from a
   Root PE connected to a traffic source CE to one or more Leaf PEs
   connected to traffic receiver CEs.  It is considered to be an
   extended architecture of the existing unicast-based SS-PW technology.

   Figure 1 describes the P2MP reference model which is derived from
   [RFC3985] to support P2MP emulated services.

   This architecture applies to the case where a P2MP PSN tunnel extends
   between edge nodes of a single PSN domain to transport a
   unidirectional P2MP PW with endpoints at these edge nodes.  In this
   model a single copy of each PW packet is sent over the PW on the P2MP
   PSN tunnel and is received by all Leaf PEs due to the P2MP nature of
   the PSN tunnel.  The P2MP PW MUST be traffic optimized, i.e., only
   one copy of a P2MP PW packet is sent on any single link.  P Routers
   participate in P2MP PSN tunnel operation but not in the signaling of
   P2MP PWs.

   The Reference Model outlines the basic pieces of a P2MP PW.  However,
   several levels of replication needs to be considered when designing a
   P2MP PW solution:

   -  Ingress PE replication to CEs: traffic is replicated to a set of
      local receiver CEs
   -  P router replication in the core: traffic replicated by means of
      P2MP PSN tunnel (P2MP LSP)
   -  Egress PE replication to CEs: traffic replicated to local receiver
      CEs

   Theoretically, it is also possible to consider Ingress PE replication
   in the core; that is, all traffic is replicated to a set of P2P PSN
   transport tunnels at ingress, not using P router replication at all.
   However, this approach may easily lead to more than one-stream
   bandwidth consumption at a single link, particularly if the PSN
   tunnels logically go over the same physical link.  Hence this
   approach is not preferred.

   Specific operations that must be performed at the PE on the native
   data units are not described here since the required pre-processing
   (Forwarder (FWRD) and Native Service Processing (NSP)) defined in
   section 4.2 of [RFC3985] are also applicable to P2MP PW.

   P2MP PWs are generally unidirectional, but a Root PE may need to
   receive unidirectional P2P traffic from any Leaf PE.  For that
   purpose the P2MP PW solution MAY support optional bidirectional
   connectivity between the Root PE and each Leaf PE:

   -  Downstream: Point-to-Multipoint (Root PE to any Leaf PE)
   -  Upstream: Point-to-Point or Multipoint-to-Point (any Leaf PE to
      Root PE)

   Depending on the service using the P2MP PW, the Root PE MAY benefit
   from information sent by a Leaf PE using P2P connectivity at the
   expense of the amount of state and configuration overhead for the P2P
   return path.  However, in most situations a Multipoint-to- point
   (MP2P) connectivity is expected to be sufficient.  Hence it MUST be

   possible for the operator to configure the attributes (P2P or MP2P)
   of the return path.

3.2.  P2MP PW and Underlying Layer

   The definition of MPLS multicast encapsulation [RFC5332] specifies
   the procedure to carry MPLS packets that are to be replicated and a
   copy of the packet sent to each of the specified next hops.  This
   notion is also applicable to P2MP PW (as a MPLS) packet carried by
   P2MP PSN tunnel.

   To be more precise, a P2MP PSN tunnel corresponds to "point-to-
   multipoint data link or tunnel" described in [RFC5332] Section 3.
   Similarly, P2MP PW labels correspond to "the top labels (before
   applying the data link or tunnel encapsulation) of all MPLS packets
   that are transmitted on a particular point-to-multipoint data link or
   tunnel."

   In P2MP PW architecture, PW label with PW-PDU is replicated by
   underlying P2MP PSN tunnel layer in SS-PW network model.  In other
   words, it is intended to utilize PSN technology designed for
   efficient multicast/broadcast trasnport.  Note that PW label is
   unchanged and hidden in transit P routers as long as the model of SS-
   PW is taken.

   In a solution, a P2MP PW MUST be supported over a single P2MP PSN
   tunnel as underlying layer of traffic distribution.  Figure 2 gives
   an example of P2MP SS-PW topology relying on a single P2MP LSP.  The
   PW tree is composed of one Root PE (i1) and several Leaf PEs (e1, e2,
   e3, e4).

   The mechanisms for establishing the PSN tunnel are outside the scope
   of this document, as long as they enable the essential attributes of
   the service to be emulated.

Internet-Draft            P2MP PW Requirements              October 2013


   A single P2MP PSN tunnel MUST be able to serve more than one P2MP PW
   traffic in an aggregated way, i.e., multiplexing.

   A P2MP PW solution MAY support different P2MP PSN tunneling
   technology (e.g., MPLS over GRE [RFC4023], or P-to-MP MPLS LSP) or
   different setup protocols. (e.g., MLDP [RFC6388], and P2MP RSVP-TE
   [RFC4875]).

   The P2MP LSP associated to the P2MP PW can be selected either by user
   configuration or by dynamically using a multiplexing/demultiplexing
   mechanism.

   The P2MP PW multiplexing SHOULD be used based on the overlap rate
   between P2MP LSP and P2MP PW.  As an example, an existing P2MP LSP
   may attach more leaves than the ones defined as Leaf PEs for a given
   P2MP PW.  It may be attractive to reuse it to minimize new
   configuration, but using this P2MP LSP would imply non-Leaf PEs
   receive unwanted traffic, not destined to Leaf PE at the service
   layer.  The operator should determine whether the P2MP PW can accept
   partially multiplexing with P2MP LSP, and a minimum congruency rate
   may be defined.  The Root PE can determine whether P2MP PW can
   multiplex to a P2MP LSP according to the congruency rate.  The
   congruency rate should take into account several items, such as:

   -  the amount of overlap between the number of Leaf PEs of P2MP PW
      and existing egress PE routers of a P2MP LSP.  If there is a
      complete overlap, the congruency is perfect and the rate is 100%.
   -  at the expense of the additional traffic (e.g. other VPNs)
      supported over the P2MP LSP.

   With this procedure a P2MP PW is nested within a P2MP LSP.  This
   allows multiplexing several PWs over a common P2MP LSP.  Prior to the
   P2MP PW signaling phase, the Root PE determines which P2MP LSP will
   be used for this P2MP PW.  The PSN Tunnel can be an existing PSN
   tunnel or the Root PE can create a new P2MP PSN tunnel.

3.3.  P2MP PW Construction

   [RFC5332] introduces two approaches to assign MPLS label (meaning PW
   label in P2MP PW's context): Upstream-Assigned[RFC5331] and
   Downstream-Assigned.  However, it is out of scope of this document
   which one should be used in PW construction.  It is left to the
   specification of the solution work.

   The following requirements apply to the establishment of P2MP PWs
   (P2MP SS-PWs):

   -  PE nodes MUST be configurable with the P2MP PW identifiers and
      ACs.
   -  A discovery mechanism SHOULD allow the Root PE to discover the
      Leaf PEs, or vice versa.
   -  Solutions SHOULD allow single-sided operation at the Root PE for
      the selection of some AC(s) at the Leaf PE(s) to be attached to
      the PW tree so that the Root PE controls the Leaf attachment.

   The Root PE SHOULD support a method to be informed about whether a
   Leaf PE has successfully attached to the PW tree.

3.4.  P2MP Signaling Requirements

3.4.1.  PW Identifier

   The P2MP PW MUST be uniquely identified.  This unique P2MP PW
   identifier MUST be used for all signaling procedures related to this
   PW (PW setup, monitoring, etc).

3.4.2.  PW type mismatch

   The Root PE and Leaf PEs of a P2MP PW MUST be configured with the
   same PW type as defined in [RFC4446] for P2P PW.  In case of a
   different type, a PE MUST abort attempts to establish the P2MP PW.

3.4.3.  Interface Parameters sub-TLV

   Some interface parameters [RFC4446] related to the AC capability have
   been defined according to the PW type and are signaled during the PW
   setup.

   Where applicable, a solution is REQUIRED to ascertain whether the AC
   at the Leaf PE is capable of supporting traffic coming from the AC at
   the Root PE.

   In case of a mismatch, the passive PE (Root or Leaf PE, depending on
   the signaling process) MUST support mechanisms to reject attempts to
   establish the P2MP SS-PW.

3.4.4.  Leaf Grafting/Pruning

   Once the PW tree is established, the solution MUST allow the addition
   or removal of a Leaf PE, or a subset of leaves to/from the existing
   tree, without any impact on the PW tree (data and control planes) for
   the remaining Leaf PEs.

Internet-Draft            P2MP PW Requirements              October 2013


   The addition or removal of a Leaf PE MUST also allow the P2MP PSN
   tunnel to be updated accordingly.  This may cause the P2MP PSN tunnel
   to add or remove the corresponding Leaf PE.

3.4.5.  Failure Detection and Reporting

   Since the underlying layer has an End-to-End P2MP topology between
   the Root PE and the Leaf PEs, the failure reporting and processing
   procedures are implemented only on the edge nodes.

   Failure events may cause one or more Leaf PEs to become detached from
   the PW tree.  These events MUST be reported to the Root PE, using
   appropriate out-of-band or inband OAM messages.

   It MUST be possible for the operator to choose the out-of-band or
   inband OAM tools or both to monitor the Leaf PE status.  The solution
   SHOULD allow the Root PE to be informed of Leaf PEs failure for
   management purposes.

   Based on these failure notifications, solutions MUST allow the Root
   PE to update the remaining leaves of the PW tree.

   -  A solution MUST support in-band OAM mechanism to detect failures:
      unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic failure.  This SHOULD
      be realized by enhancing existing unicast PW methods, such as VCCV
      for seamless and familiar operation defined in [RFC5085][RFC6073].
   -  In case of failure, it SHOULD correctly report which Leaf PEs are
      affected.  This SHOULD be realized by enhancing existing PW
      methods, such as LDP Status Notification.  The notification
      message SHOULD include the type of fault (P2MP PW, AC or PSN
      tunnel).
   -  A Leaf PE MAY be notified of the status of the Root PE's AC.
   -  A solution MUST support OAM message mapping [RFC6310] at the Root
      PE and Leaf PE if a failure is detected on the source CE AC.

3.4.6.  Protection and Restoration

   It is assumed that if recovery procedures are required, the P2MP PSN
   tunnel will support standard MPLS-based recovery techniques
   (typically based on RSVP-TE).  In that case a mechanism SHOULD be
   implemented to avoid race conditions between recovery at the PSN
   level and recovery at the PW level.

   An alternative protection scheme MAY rely on the PW layer.

   Leaf PEs MAY be protected via a P2MP PW redundancy mechanism.  In the
   example depicted below, a standby P2MP PW is used to protect the
   active P2MP.  In that protection scheme the AC at the Root PE MUST

   serve both P2MP PWs.  In this scenario, the condition when to do the
   switchover SHOULD be implemented, e.g. one or all Leaf failure of
   active P2MP PW will course P2MP PW switchover.

   The Root PE MAY be protected via a P2MP PW redundancy mechanism.  In
   the example depicted below, a standby P2MP PW is used to protect the
   active P2MP.  A single AC at the Leaf PE MUST be used to attach the
   CE to the primary and the standby P2MP PW.  The Leaf PE MUST support
   protection mechanisms in order to select the active P2MP PW.

Internet-Draft            P2MP PW Requirements              October 2013


3.4.7.  Scalability

   The solution SHOULD scale at least linearly with the number of Leaf
   PEs.

   Increasing the number of P2MP PWs between a Root PE and a given set
   of Leaf PEs SHOULD NOT cause the P router to increase the number of
   entries in its forwarding table by the same or greater proportion.
   Multiplexing P2MP PWs to P2MP PSN Tunnels achieves this.

4.  Manageability considerations

   The solution SHOULD provide a simple provisioning procedure to build
   a P2MP PW.

   The solution MUST take into consideration the situation where the
   Root PE and Leaf PEs are not managed by a single NMS.

   In that case it MUST be possible to manage the whole P2MP PW using a
   single NMS.  Typically the P2MP PW could be managed from the Root PE.

5.  Backward Compatibility

   Solutions MUST be backward compatible with current PW standards.
   Solutions SHOULD utilize existing capability advertisement and
   negotiation procedures for the PEs implementing P2MP PW endpoints.

   The implementation of OAM mechanisms also implies the advertisement
   of PE capabilities to support specific OAM features.  The solution
   MAY allow advertising P2MP PW OAM capabilities.

   A solution MUST NOT allow a P2PW to be established to PEs that do not
   support P2MP PW functionality.  It MUST have a mechanism to report an
   error for incompatible PEs.

   In some cases, upstream traffic is needed from downstream CEs to
   upstream CEs.  The P2MP PW solution SHOULD allow a return path (i.e.
   from the Leaf to the Root) that provides upstream connectivity.

   In particular, the same ACs MAY be shared between downstream and
   upstream directions.  For downstream, a CE receives traffic
   originated by the Root PE over its AC.  For upstream, the CE MAY also
   send traffic destined to the same Root PE over the same AC.

6.  Security Considerations

Internet-Draft            P2MP PW Requirements              October 2013


   The security requirements common to PW are raised in Section 10 of
   [RFC3916].  P2MP PW is a variant of the initial P2P PW definition,
   and those requirements also apply to P2MP PW.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any IANA action.
