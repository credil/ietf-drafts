Abstract

   This document specifies requirements for algorithms that make ICE
   connectivity checks more responsive by reducing delays in dual-stack
   host ICE connectivity checks when there is a path failure for the
   address family preferred by the application or by the operating
   system.  As IPv6 is usually preferred, the procedures in this
   document helps avoid user-noticeable delays when the IPv6 path is
   broken or excessively slow.

1.  Introduction

   In situations where there are many IPv6 addresses, ICE [RFC5245] will
   prefer IPv6 candidates [RFC6724] and will attempt connectivity checks
   on all the IPv6 candidates before trying an IPv4 candidate.  If the
   IPv6 path is broken, this fallback to IPv4 can consume a lot of time,
   harming user satisfaction of dual-stack devices.

   This document describes an algorithm that makes ICE connectivity
   checks more responsive to failures of an address family by reordering
   the candidates such that IPv6 and IPv4 candidates get a fair chance
   during connectivity checks.  This document specifies requirements for
   any such algorithm, with the goals that the ICE agent need not be
   inordinately harmed with a simple reordering of the candidates.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This note uses terminology defined in [RFC5245].

3.  Candidates Priority

   A prioritization formula is used by ICE [RFC5245] so that most
   preferred address pairs are tested first, and if a sufficiently good
   pair is discovered, the tests can be stopped.  With IPv6, addresses
   obtained from local network interfaces, called host candidates, are

   recommended as high-priority ones to be tested first since if they
   work, they provide usually the best path between the two hosts.  The
   ICE specification recommends to use the rules defined in [RFC6724] as
   part of the prioritization formula for IPv6 host candidates and
   [I-D.keranen-mmusic-ice-address-selection] updates the ICE rules on
   how IPv6 host candidates are selected.

   For dual-stack hosts the preference for IPv6 host candidates is
   higher than IPv4 host candidates based on precedence value of IP
   addresses described in [RFC6724].  IPv6 server reflexive candidates
   have higher precedence than IPv4 server reflexive candidate since
   NPTv6 is stateless and transport-agnostic.

   (highest)  IPv6 Host Candidate
              IPv4 Host Candidate
              IPv6 Server Reflexive Candidate
              IPv4 Server Reflexive Candidate
              IPv6 Relayed Transport Candidate
   (lowest)   IPv4 Relayed Transport Candidate

            Figure 1: Candidate Preferences in decreasing order

   By using the technique described in Section 4, if there are both IPv6
   and IPv4 addresses candidates gathered, and the first 'N' candidates
   are of the same IP address family, then the highest-priority
   candidate of the other address family is promoted to position N in
   the check list thus making ICE connectivity checks more responsive to
   failures of an address family.

   Note: The algorithm works even if the administrator changes the
   policy table to prefer IPv4 addresses over IPv6 addresses as defined
   in [RFC6724].

4.  Algorithm overview

   The Happy Eyeballs Extension for ICE algorithm proposes the following
   steps after candidates are prioritized using the formula in section
   4.1.2.1 of [RFC5245]:

   a.  If the first 'N' candidates are of the same IP address family,
       then the highest-priority candidate of the other address family
       is promoted to position 'N+1' in the list.

   b.  Step a is repeated for subsequent candidates in the list until
       all candidates of the preferred address family are exhausted.

Internet-Draft           Happy Eyeballs for ICE              August 2013


   The result of these steps is that after every consecutive 'N'
   candidates of the preferred family, a candidate of the other family
   is inserted.

   The following figure illustrates the result of the algorithm on
   candidates:

   Before Happy Eyeballs Extension for ICE algorithm :

    (highest)  IPv6 Host Candidate-1
               IPv6 Host Candidate-2

               IPv6 Host Candidate-5
               IPv6 Host Candidate-6
               IPv6 Host Candidate-7

               IPv6 Server Reflexive Candidate
               IPv4 Server Reflexive Candidate
               IPv6 Relayed Transport Candidate
    (lowest)   IPv4 Relayed Transport Candidate


   After Happy Eyeballs Extension for ICE algorithm :
   --------------------------------------------------
    (highest)  IPv6 Host Candidate-1
               IPv6 Host Candidate-2
               IPv6 Host Candidate-3
               IPv4 Host Candidate                 ---> Promoted candidate
               IPv6 Host Candidate-4
               IPv6 Host Candidate-5
               IPv6 Host Candidate-6
               IPv4 Server Reflexive Candidate    ---> Promoted candidate
               IPv6 Host Candidate-7
               IPv6 Server Reflexive Candidate
               IPv6 Relayed Transport Candidate
    (lowest)   IPv4 Relayed Transport Candidate


4.1.  Processing the Results

   If ICE connectivity checks using IPv4 candidate is successful then
   ICE Agent performs as usual "Discovering Peer Reflexive Candidates"
   (Section 7.1.3.2.1 of [RFC5245]), "Constructing a Valid Pair"
   (Section 7.1.3.2.2 of [RFC5245]), "Updating Pair States"
   (Section 7.1.3.2.3 of [RFC5245]), "Updating the Nominated Flag"
   (Section 7.1.3.2.4 of [RFC5245]).

   If ICE connectivity checks using an IPv4 candidate is successful for
   each component of the media stream and connectivity checks using IPv6
   candidates is not yet successful, the ICE endpoint will declare
   victory, conclude ICE for the media stream and start sending media
   using IPv4.  However, it is also possible that ICE endpoint continues
   to perform ICE connectivity checks with IPv6 candidate pairs and if
   checks using higher-priority IPv6 candidate pair is successful then
   media stream can be moved to the IPv6 candidate pair.  Continuing to
   perform connectivity checks can be useful for subsequent connections,
   to optimize which connectivity checks are tried first.  Such
   optimization is out of scope of this document.

   The following diagram shows the behaviour during the connectivity
   check when Alice calls Bob and Agent Alice is the controlling agent
   and uses the aggressive nomination algorithm.  "USE-CAND" implies the
   presence of the USE-CANDIDATE attribute.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.

6.  Security Considerations

   STUN connectivity check using MAC computed during key exchanged in
   the signaling channel provides message integrity and data origin
   authentication as described in section 2.5 of [RFC5245] apply to this
