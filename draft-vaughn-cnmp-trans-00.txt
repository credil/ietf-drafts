INTERNET DRAFT         Document Roadmap for CNMP       November 20, 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document provides the recommended transport mapping for CNMP.
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the Condensed
   Network Management Protocol, please refer to [Intro].

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Within this INTERNET-DRAFT and all referenced documents, CNMP is to
   be considered another version of SNMP.  It is only given a different
   name because the protocol encoding does not follow the same message
   format as SNMP messages and the protocol will use a different binding
   with the transport layer.

3.  CNMP over UDP over IPv4

   This is the preferred transport mapping.

3.1.  Serialization

   Each instance of a message SHALL be serialized (i.e., encoded
   according to the convention of [OER]) onto a single UDP [RFC0768]
   over IPv4 [RFC0791] datagram.

3.2.  Well-known Values

   It is suggested that administrators configure their SNMP entities 
   supporting command responder applications to listen on UDP port TBD1.
    Further, it is suggested that SNMP entities supporting notification
   receiver applications be configured to listen on UDP port TBD2.

3.3.  Size Constraints

   When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it SHALL be capable
   of accepting messages up to and including 484 octets in size.  It
   SHOULD be capable of accepting messages of up to 1472 octets in size.
    It MAY be capable of accepting messages of larger sizes.

4.  CNMP over T2 over Null

   This is an alternate transport mapping.

4.1.  Serialization

INTERNET DRAFT         Document Roadmap for CNMP       November 20, 2013


   Each instance of a message SHALL be serialized (i.e., encoded
   according to the convention of [OER]) onto a single T2 [T2] datagram.

4.2.  Well-known Values

   It is suggested that administrators configure their SNMP entities 
   supporting command responder applications to listen on UDP port TBD1.
    Further, it is suggested that SNMP entities supporting notification
   receiver applications be configured to listen on UDP port TBD2.

4.3.  Size Constraints

   When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it SHALL be capable
   of accepting messages up to and including 484 octets in size.  It
   SHOULD be capable of accepting messages of up to 1472 octets in size.
    It MAY be capable of accepting messages of larger sizes.

5.  Serialization using the Octet Encoding Rules

   When encoding an object whose syntax is described using the BITS
   construct, the value SHALL be encoded as an OCTET STRING, in which
   all the named bits in (the definition of) the bitstring, commencing
   with the first bit and proceeding to the last bit, are placed in bits
   8 (high order bit) to 1 (low order bit) of the first octet, followed
   by bits 8 to 1 of each subsequent octet in turn, followed by as many
   bits as are needed of the final subsequent octet, commencing with bit
   8.  Remaining bits, if any, of the final octet are set to zero on
   generation and ignored on receipt.

   Examples of applying OER are provided in Appendix A of [Intro].

6.  Security Considerations

   CNMP offers different levels of security based on user needs. 

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the CNMP framework.  Specifically, the use of
   the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414], the
   Transport Security Model [RFC5590], and the View-based Access Control
   Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the entity
   giving access to a MIB is properly configured to give access to the
   objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights
   to indeed GET or SET (change) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign a User Port number number from the Service Name
   and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers> for TBD1 and TBD2,
   both of which are referenced in both Clauses 3.2 and 4.2.
