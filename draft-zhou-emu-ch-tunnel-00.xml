      <t>This document proposes to incorporate channel binding as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-emu-chbind ] into EAP tunnel method as soon as possible.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Channel binding as define in <xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-chbind"/> is
      used to imitigate lying authenticator , and is implemented as part of
      the ongoing EAP method, because the assertion transported from the EAP
      server to EAP peer is authenticated by the resluting key (TEK, to be
      more specific) derived from the EAP method. Although it is a bit late to
      know the contacting authenticator is a liar after the peer has completed
      the EAP method, it is a rather reasonable compromise to the legacy EAP
      methods.</t>

      <t>EAP Tunnel methods, e.g., defined in <xref target="RFC4851"/><xref
      target="RFC5281"/><xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method"/>, are
      used to protect weak EAP methods, especially some legacy EAP methods.
      When it comes to using channel binding in tunnel methods, it is more
      complex. To maximise the compatibility , channel binding may still be
      carried out with the inner EAP method, using the inner TEK, or some key
      derived from tunnel key (output from tunnel method) and inner EAP method
      key, which has not been specified. This way, a peer is assured of the
      honesty of the contacting authenticator only after both the tunnel
      establishement and the completement of the inner EAP method.</t>

      <t>Since tunnel methods are used to protect the inner method, it might
      be desirebale to provide channel binding simultaneously with or right
      after the tunnel establishment.</t>

    <section title="Channel Binding after Tunnel Establishment">
      <t>When there is no inner EAP method after the tunnel
      establishement,which is not ruled out in the current tunnel method
      specification, or the inner method does not output key, channel binding
      is carried out immediately after the tunnel establishment according to
      the procedure defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-emu-chbind"/>, the key
      used to authenticate the CB_Success or CB-Failure is derived from the
      tunnel key TK and some shared secret (TEK) between EAP server and the
      peer. TEK could be NULL if no shared secret can be provided at this
      time.</t>

      <t>In this case, when TEK is NULL, the certificate verification of the
      EAP server (i.e., the tunnel server) is crucial, as pointed out in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-emu-crypto-bind"/>.</t>

    <section title="Channel Binding after the First Inner Method">
      <t>When some inner methods are carried out after the tunnel
      establishment, and the first inner method outputs key, channel binding
      is executed along with the first inner method, as defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-emu-chbind"/>,the key used to authenticate the
      CB-Success or CB_Failure is derived from the tunnel key TK and one of
      the outputs of the first inner method , i.e., TEK.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
