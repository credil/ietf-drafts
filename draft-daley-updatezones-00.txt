1.  Definitions

   This memo uses the following DNS server roles in a manner consistent
   with RFC 2136 [RFC2136]:

   Slave   An authoritative server that uses AXFR or IXFR to retrieve
           the zone and is named in the zone's NS RRset.

   Master  An authoritative server configured to be the source of AXFR
           or IXFR data for one or more slave servers.

   This memo uses the term "catalog of zones" in the spirit of RFC 1035
   [RFC1035] to describe the set of zones that a server is authoritative
   for.

2.  Introduction

   It is common practice for Internet service providers and domain name
   registrars to operate DNS servers that are simultaneously
   authoritative for many zones.  In some case a single DNS server may
   be authoritative for hundreds of thousands of zones.  Despite the
   large number of zones served, the server is unlikely to also be
   authoritative for a common parent of these zones and so must operate
   each zone independently.

Internet-Draft                 updatezones                 November 2013


   The DNS protocol supports the provisioning of resource records in
   zones already being served by an authoritative DNS server using the
   DNS UPDATE message described in RFC 2136 [RFC2136].  However no
   similar operation exists to update the list of zones that a server
   serves.

   This memo describes an extension to the DNS UPDATE message that
   allows it to be used to instruct an authoritative DNS server to start
   serving or stop serving zones.  This extension supports the remote
   provisioning of zones in the same manner that DNS UPDATE supports the
   remote provisioning of Resource Records.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Extending the DNS UPDATE message

   RFC 2136 [RFC2136] defines the DNS UPDATE message which enables the
   remote provisioning of data within existing zones.  The operations
   enabled by RFC 2136 [RFC2136] are now referred to as 'in zone'
   operations.

   This memo extends the definition of the DNS UPDATE message to enable
   the remote provisioning of zones.  The operations enabled by this
   memo are referred to as 'whole of zone' operations.

   Two 'whole of zone' operations are defined in this memo:

   1.  Adding zones.  Instructing the receiving server to add one or
       more zones to the catalog of authoritative zones that it serves
       and start serving these zone, either as a master or a slave.

   2.  Removing zones.  Instructing the receiving server to stop serving
       one or more authoritative zones and remove them from the catalog
       of zones that it serves.

   The operations described in this memo operate on the catalog of zones
   irrespective of whether or not the server is currently responding to
   queries for a specific zone as a server may at any point time be
   actively serving only some of the zones in its catalog for
   operational reasons.

3.1.  'in zone' vs 'whole of zone' operations





Daley                     Expires May 16, 2014                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 updatezones                 November 2013


   'in zone' operations are distinguished from 'whole of zone'
   operations by the ZTYPE of the zones in the Zone section of the DNS
   UPDATE message:

   o  For 'in zone' operations the ZTYPE of all of the zones in the Zone
      section MUST be SOA.

   o  For 'whole of zone' operations the ZTYPE of all of the zones in
      the Zone section MUST be NS.

   It is not possible to have both 'in zone' and 'whole of zone'
   operations in the same DNS UPDATE message and so the zones in the
   Zone section MUST NOT have different ZTYPES.

   'whole of zone' operations interpret the data in the Prerequisite,
   Update and Additional sections differently from 'in zone' operations.

3.2.  Adding zones

   The operation to add new authoritative zones can come in one of two
   forms:

   1.  Add a master zone.  Instructing the receiving server to add a new
       zone and serve that zone as a master.

   2.  Adding slave zones.  Instructing the receiving server to add one
       or more new zones and serve those as a slave.

3.2.1.  Adding a master zone

   To add a master zone the DNS UPDATE is constructed as follows:

   One zone and only one zone MUST be listed in the Zone section.  and
   the ZTYPE of that zone MUST be set to NS.

   The Prerequisitie section MUST be empty.

   The Update section MUST contain the SOA record for the new zone.  The
   class of the SOA record MUST NOT be ANY.

   The Update section MAY contain any other resource records that are to
   be added to the zone.

   The receiving server MUST add the SOA record and any records in the
   Update section to the zone before serving the zone.

   The Additional section MUST be empty.

3.2.2.  Adding slave zones

   To add slave zones the DNS UPDATE is constructed as follows:

   One or more zones MUST be listed in the Zone section.  and the ZTYPE
   of those zone MUST be set to NS.

   The Prerequisitie section MUST be empty.

   The Update section MUST be empty.

   The Additional section MUST contain at least one A or AAAA resource
   record.  All A and AAAA records are used by the receiving server to
   identify the servers it should contact to pull the zones from.

   The Additional section MAY contain a TKEY record that the receiving
   server should use to authenticate itself when it pulls the zones.

   The resource records in the Additional section MUST NOT be added to
   the zones.

3.3.  Removing zones

   To remove zones the DNS UPDATE is constructed as follows:

   One or more zones MUST be listed in the Zone section.  and the ZTYPE
   of those zones MUST be set to NS.

   The Prerequisitie section MUST be empty.

   The Update section MUST contain a SOA record for the zone to be
   deleted and the class of the SOA record MUST be ANY.  This use of a
   class of ANY to signal the removal of a zone matches the way that a
   resource record that is to be deleted is identified in RFC 2136
   [RFC2136]

   The Additional section MUST be empty.

3.4.  Response

   The response sent to acknowledge receipt and processing of a 'whole
   of zone' operation is the same as specified for an 'in zone'
   operation in RFC 2136 [RFC2136] with the addition of the following
   specific error conditions:

   1.  When adding zones, If any of the zones listed are already in the
       catalog of authoritative zones served by the receiving server,
       whether or not it is currently being served, then the server MUST

       ignore the entire request and return an error response with
       RCode=YXDOMAIN.

   2.  When adding zones if both the Update and Additional sections are
       empty then the receiving server MUST ignore the entire request
       and return an error response with RCode=FORMERROR.

   3.  When adding zones if both the Update and Additional sections
       contain data then the receiving server MUST ignore the entire
       request and return an error response with RCode=FORMERROR.

   4.  When adding a master zone, if initial zone data is provided and
       the domains names of those resource records are not within the
       zone being added (i.e. they are 'out of bailiwick') then the
       receiving server SHOULD ignore the entire operation and return an
       error response with RCode=FORMERROR.

   5.  When removing zones, if any of the zones listed are not in the
       catalog of zones served by the receiving server then it MUST
       ignore the entire request and return an error response with
       RCode=NXDOMAIN.

4.  Processing 'whole of zone' operations

4.1.  Dynamic serving

   It is recognised that not all authoritative nameservers are capable
   of dynamically loading new zones to serve or dynamically ceasing to
   serve zones.  It is left to the implementor to decide whether to load
   /unload the zones dynamically; wait for a server restart or to
   initiate a restart itself.

4.2.  Atomicity

   This memo does not change the requirements for serialisation of
   UPDATE operations the depend on each other, as specified in section
   3.7 of RFC 2136 [RFC2136], which apply equally to 'whole of zone'
   operations as they do to 'in zone' operations.

4.3.  Provisioning order

   A server receiving a 'whole of zone' operation SHOULD NOT assume any
   particular order to the provisioning of zones and reject the
   operation as a result.  Examples of erroneous rejections include:

   1.  When adding slave zones, rejecting the operation if the master
       servers specified are unreachable or do not serve the required
       zone.

Internet-Draft                 updatezones                 November 2013


   2.  When adding or removing zones, rejecting the operation if it
       would leave an incorrect or inconsistent set of nameservers for
       that zone specified in that zone or in the parent delegation.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The author thanks Mark Andrews for his input.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   Clearly unrestricted access to 'whole of zone' operations is a
   significant threat and misuse would be likely to cause considerable
   issues.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that:

   o  DNS UPDATE messages that contain 'whole of zone' operations are
      protected by TSIG and implementors allow adminstrators to require
      this protection.

   o  Implementors do not enable processing of 'whole of zone'
      operations by default.

   The provision of a TKEY record is a significant vulnerability if the
   DNS UPDATE message containing it is transmitted in clear over the
   wire.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that such messages are encrypted.
