Internet-Draft        ECC Brainpool Curves for TLS         November 2012


1.  Introduction

   In [RFC5639], a new set of elliptic curve groups over finite prime
   fields for use in cryptographic applications was specified.  These
   groups, denoted as ECC Brainpool curves, were generated in a
   verifiably pseudo-random way and comply with the security
   requirements of relevant standards from ISO [ISO1] [ISO2], ANSI
   [ANSI1], NIST [FIPS], and SecG [SEC2].

   Usage of elliptic curves for authentication and key agreement in TLS
   1.1 and TLS 2.0 is defined in [RFC4492].  While the ASN.1 object
   identifiers defined in [RFC5639] already allow usage of the ECC
   Brainpool curves for TLS (client or server) authentication through
   reference in X.509 certificates according to [RFC3279], their
   negotiation for key exchange according to [RFC4492] requires the
   definition and assignment of additional NamedCurve IDs.  This
   document specifies such values for three curves from [RFC5639].

2.  Values to be Used in the Supported Elliptic Curve Extension

   According to [RFC4492], the Supported Elliptic Curve Extension allows
   the negotiation of elliptic curve groups during a handshake starting
   a new TLS session.  A client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its
   ClientHello message SHOULD include this extension to indicate the
   elliptic curves it supports through NamedCurve IDs, and a server that
   receives a ClientHello containing this extension MUST use the
   client's enumerated capabilities to guide its selection of an
   appropriate cipher suite.  Furthermore, the server SHOULD use a
   NamedCurve ID, if applicable, to specify the elliptic curve
   corresponding to its ephemeral ECDH public key.

   The values of NamedCurve, by which the elliptic curves are
   identified, are governed by the EC Named Curve Registry of IANA
   [IANA-TLS].  In Table 1, new values for NamedCurve for three of the
   ECC Brainpool curves defined in [RFC5639] are specified.  All three
   curves are suitable for usage in DTLS [RFC6347].

                        |      Curve      | Value |

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5246] apply accordingly.

   The confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of the TLS
   communication is limited by the weakest cryptographic primitive
   applied.  In order to achieve a maximum security level when using one
   of the elliptic curves from Table 1 for authentication and / or key
   exchange in TLS, the key derivation function, the algorithms and key
   lengths of symmetric encryption and message authentication as well as
   the algorithm, bit length and hash function used for signature
   generation should be chosen according to the recommendations of
   [NIST800-57] and [RFC5639].  Furthermore, the private Diffie-Hellman
   keys should be selected with the same bit length as the order of the
   group generated by the base point G and with approximately maximum
   entropy.

   Implementations of elliptic curve cryptography for TLS may be
   susceptible to side-channel attacks.  Particular care should be taken
   for implementations that internally transform curve points to points
   on the corresponding "twisted curve", using the map (x',y') = (x*Z^2,
   y*Z^3) with the coefficient Z specified for that curve in [RFC5639],
   in order to take advantage of an an efficient arithmetic based on the
   twisted curve's special parameters (A = -3): although the twisted
   curve itself offers the same level of security as the corresponding
   random curve (through mathematical equivalence), an arithmetic based
   on small curve parameters may be harder to protect against side-
   channel attacks.  General guidance on resistence of elliptic curve
   cryptography implementations against side-channel-attacks is given in
   [BSI1] and [HMV].

4.  IANA Considerations

   Before this document can become an RFC, IANA is required to assign
   numbers for the elliptic curves specified in Table 1 to the
   NamedCurve name space in its Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   Parameters registry [IANA-TLS].  For all these elliptic curves,
   suitability with DTLS shall be indicated in the registry.

5.  Intellectual Property Rights

   Although, the authors have no knowledge about any intellectual
   property rights which cover the general usage of the ECP groups
   defined herein, implementations based on these domain parameters may
   require use of inventions covered by patent rights.  In particular,
   techniques for an efficient arithmetic exploiting the special
   parameters of the twisted curves (see Section 3) may be covered by
   patents.

Appendix A.  Test Vectors

   This section provides some test vectors for example Diffie-Hellman
   key exchanges using each of the curves defined in Section 2 .  In all
   of the following sections the following notation is used:

      d_A: the secret key of party A

      x_qA: the x-coordinate of the public key of party A

      y_qA: the y-coordinate of the public key of party A

      d_B: the secret key of party B

      x_qB: the x-coordinate of the public key of party B

      y_qB: the y-coordinate of the public key of party B

      x_Z: the x-coordinate of the shared secret that results from
      completion of the Diffie-Hellman computation, i.e. the hex
      representation of the pre-master secret

      y_Z: the y-coordinate of the shared secret that results from
      completion of the Diffie-Hellman computation

   The field elements x_qA, y_qA, x_qB, y_qB, x_Z, y_Z are represented
   as hexadecimal values using the FieldElement-to-OctetString
   conversion method specified in [SEC1].
