                       Service Chaining Use Cases
                draft-liu-service-chaining-use-cases-00

Abstract

   For some network services, traffic is forwarded through a sequence of
   network functions, which usually have dedicated capabilities other
   than forwarding, e.g. firewall.  Forwarding of traffic along a
   sequence of service processing functions is usually based on service
   characteristics, but not destination addresses.  We call such way of
   forwarding as service chaining.  This memo describes use cases of
   service chaining.

1.  Introduction

   Service flow traffic is fowarded through some network middle boxes
   for specific purposes, for example:

      a) Direct some kinds of traffic to a domain border gateway for
      monitoring and charging.

      b) Before sending traffic to DC servers, steer the traffic to go
      through a load balancer to distribute performance pressure.

      c) Mobile network operators split mobile broadband traffic and
      steer them along an offloading path.

      d) Use firewall for filtering traffic for IDS(Intrusion Detection
      System)/IPS(Intrusion Protection System).

      e) Use security gateway to encrypt/decrypt traffic.

      f) When traffic has to traverse different network technology
      segements, for example IPv4/IPv6, direct the traffic to CGNAT.

   Cloud computing technology has been more mature in recent years and
   triggers an idea that moves above service processing functions from
   purpose-designed hardware box into general computing servers.  This
   idea can greatly save operators' cost for buying/maintaining the
   network middle boxes and give a big chance to operators on value
   added services.

Internet-Draft         Service Chaining Use Cases              June 2013


   We call the mechanism of steering traffic to service processing
   functions/service nodes before the traffic arrive their destination
   as Service chaining.

   This document describes some use cases of service chaining.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   Service Processing Function:  a logical entity which can provide one
      or more service processing functions for packets/frames such as
      firewall, DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), LI (Lawful Intercept) and
      etc.  Usually these processing functions are computation
      intensive.

   Service Chain:  one or more service processing functions in a
      specific order which are chained to provide a composite service,
      and packets/frames from one or more service flow should follow.

   Service Chaining:  a mechanism of building service chains and
      forwarding packets/frames of service flows through them.

   Service Path:  a path that traffic flows are forwarded through in a
      service chain.  There might be multiple paths in a service chain.

   Service Flow:  packets/frames with specific service characteristics
      (e.g., packets matching a specific tuple of fields in Ethernet,
      IP, TCP, HTTP headers and etc.) or determined by some service
      policies (such as access port and etc.)

3.  Use Cases of Service Chaining

3.1.  Use case for service chain with NAT function

   Due to IPv4 address exhaustion, more and more operators have deployed
   or are about to deploy IPv6 transition technologies such as NAT.  The
   traffic traversing a NAT function may go through different types of
   IP address domain.  One key feature of this scenario is that
   characteristics of packets before and after processed by the service
   processing function are different, e.g., from IPv4 to IPv6.  The
   unpredictability of processed packets, due to the algorithm in the
   service processing function, brings difficulties in steering the
   traffic.

                 Figure 1: service chain with NAT function

   Figure 1 shows a specific example of service chain with NAT function.
   Service flow1 is processed by service processing function C, (NAT)
   and E sequentially.  In this example, the service processing
   function(NAT) performs a NAT46 operation onto the flow.  As a result,
   packets after processing by the service processing function(NAT) are
   in IPv6, which is a different version of IP header from the packets
   before processing.  Service chaining in this scenario should be able
   to identify the flow even if it is changed after processed by service
   processing functions.

3.2.  Use Case For Multiple Underlay Networks

   Operators may need to deploy their networks with various types of
   underlay technologies.  Therefore, service chaining needs to support
   different types of underlay networks.

           |  |  Ethernet  |  | v  |            |  |
           +->+  network   +->+ +->+ IP network +->+
              |            |       |            |
               \\        //         \\        //
                  ------               ------

           Figure 2: multiple underlay networks: Ethernet and IP

   Figure 2 illustrates an example of Ethernet and IP network, very
   common and easy for deployment based on existing network status, as
   underlay networks.  Service processing functions A, B and C locate in
   Ethernet and IP networks respectively.  To build a service chain of
   SPF A, B and C, service chaining needs to support steering traffic
   across Ethernet and IP underlay networks.

3.3.  Use case of service path forking

   To enable service or content awareness, operators need DPI functions
   to look into packets.  When a DPI function is part of a service
   chain, packets processed by the DPI function may be directed to
   different paths according to result of DPI processing.  That means a
   forking service path.

        +---------+        +-----+----+        +----------+
                                 |
                                 |
                                 V
                           +-----+----+
                           |          |
                           | Parental |
                           | control  |
                           +-----+----+
                                 |
                                 |
                                 V


                     Figure 3: a forking service path

   Figure 3 shows the use case of a forking service path.  Traffic first
   goes through a firewall and then arrives at DPI function which
   discerns virus risk.  If a certain preconfigured pattern is matched,
   the traffic is directed to an anti-virus function.

   Such DPI function may fork out more than one path.

3.4.  Use case of multiple service paths share one network service
      function

   Some carrier grade hardware box or service processing functions
   runing on high performance servers can be shared to support multiple
   service chains.  Following is an example.

    Figure 4: two service chains share one service processing function

   In Figure 4, there are three service processing functions, firewall,
   VideoOpt and Parental Control, and two service chains SC1 and SC2.
   SC1 serves broadband user group1 which subscribes to secure web
   surfing and internet video optimization, while SC2 serves broadband
   user group2 which subscribes to secure web surfing with parental
   control.  SFP Firewall is shared by both service chains.
