Internet-Draft Internet-wide Geo-networking Prob. Stat. November 2013      

1.  Introduction

1.1 Motivation

   Internet-based applications use IP addresses to address a node that 
   can be a host, a server or a router. Scenarios and use cases exist    
   where nodes are being addressed using their geographical 
   location instead of their IP address. The most obvious use cases are 
   related to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and vehicular 
   networking, environmental monitoring, consumer electronic devices 
   (e.g. cameras) and scientific instruments. In this document we will 
   mainly focus on ITS and vehicular networking. An ITS use case is, for 
   example, a traffic jam or a chain collision, where all vehicles 
   heading towards the potential hazard should be warned. In particular, 
   for vehicles ahead that are moving away from the hazardous location, 
   the information is not relevant anymore. In such dangerous situation 
   geo-networking can offer great support to applications that require 
   geographical addressing.

   Internet-wide Geo-Networking is a location-aware forwarding protocol 
   that provides packet routing using geographical positions for packet 
   transport over the Internet. Vehicular networking can be considered
   as one of the most important enabling technologies required to
   implement a myriad of applications related to vehicles, vehicle
   traffic, drivers, passengers and pedestrians. Two main types of 
   vehicle communication networks can be distinguished. In the Vehicle-
   to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication network packets are exchanged 
   among vehicles using an infrastructure that can be Internet-wide. The   
   second type is Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, where packets 
   are exchanged among vehicles without the need for a communication
   infrastructure. Hybrid scenarios that combine V2V and V2I 
   communication appear reasonable.

   Intelligent Transportation Systems aim to improve the operation of 
   vehicles, manage vehicle traffic, assist drivers with safety and 
   other information, along with provisioning of convenience 
   applications. Prime examples of ITS services include automated toll
   collection systems, driver assist systems and other information
   provisioning systems. Over the last decade, the development of ITS
   services has been backed up by coordinated efforts for 
   standardization and formation of consortia and other governmental and 
   industrial bodies that aim to set the guiding principles, 
   requirements, and first takes on solutions for ITS-related
   communication systems that primarily involve vehicles and users 
   within vehicles.

   The main challenges that are associated with Internet-wide geo-
   networking are:
     o) support of geo-addressing, where geographical information 
        should be available in the addressing mechanism, such that 
        packets can be forwarded to a target geographical area. The 
        geographical area may either be specified by the source 
        (application) or might not be specified at all.

Internet-Draft Internet-wide Geo-networking Prob. Stat. November 2013      

     o) support of Internet-wide geo-routing, where data packets that 
        are generated by source nodes placed anywhere in the 
        Internet are forwarded over multiple hops by using the 
        position of the destination node(s) and the positions of 
        intermediate nodes for the routing decisions.
     o) creation of a forwarding method that comprises (1) a local-
        computer decision algorithm which can deterministically compare 
        IP/geographical addresses present in a packet to IP/geographical 
        addresses present in a local database, (2) a (mixed IP and 
        geographical) database topology distribution algorithm among 
        several computers, and (3) an IP/geographical path construction 
        algorithm which acts on the IP/geographical database.
     o) the use of a single consensual geodesic datum which may be used 
        by present and future GNSSs (Global Navigation Satellite 
        Systems) by as many as possible network operators, and agreed 
        datum conversion methods.
     o) representation of precision in IP addressing. IP addresses are 
        precise and unique, whereas geographical coordinates involve 
        notions of precision and accuracy.

   Geo-addressing:
   In [RFC2009], three families of solutions are described to
   integrate the concept of physical location into the current
   design of Internet that relies on logical addressing. These
   families of solutions are: (1) Application layer solutions, (2)
   GPS-Multicast solution. (3) Unicast IP routing extended to
   deal with GPS addresses. In particular, [RFC2009] specifies how GPS 
   positioning is used for destination addresses. A GPS (Global 
   Positioning System) address could be represented by using: (1) closed 
   polygons, such as circle(center point, radius), where, any node that 
   lies within the defined geographic area could receive a message, (2) 
   site-name as a geographic access path, where a message can be sent to 
   a specific site by specifying its location in terms of real-word
   names such as names of site, city, township, county, state, etc.
   [ETSI-EN-302-636-4-1] specifies geographical addressing for point-to-
   point and point-to-multipoint communications over short range  
   wireless communication technologies, such as ITS-G5, for vehicle-to-
   vehicle communication.
   Also other solutions for geo-addressing have been specified, but 
   none of them have been applied for Internet-wide geo-networking.
   
   Geo-routing: 
   A significant number of geo-routing protocols are available, see 
   e.g., [KaAl11] for a survey. These protocols can mainly be divided in
   two categories. The first category focuses on unicast routing, and 
   the second covers broadcast routing. [ETSI-EN-302-636-4-1] specifies 
   an sub-IP-routing protocol with unicast and broadcast forwarding 
   schemes for multi-hop and ad hoc communication among vehicles and 
   between vehicles and roadside station utilizing geographical 
   positions.  
   [ETSI-EN-302-636-6-1] has standardized the transmission of IPv6
   packets over ETSI GeoNetworking that can be used for the forwarding 
   of IPv6 packets using the position of the destination node(s) and the 
   positions of intermediate nodes for the routing decisions.

   However, these geo-routing protocols are not designed for Internet-
   wide geo-networking.

1.2 Goal

   Internet-wide geo-networking targets at IP-layer extensions that 
   allow source nodes anywhere in the Internet to geo(broad/any)cast 
   packets to all/any node(s) with geo-location awareness within an 
   arbitrary, source-specified destination area.

1.3.  Terminology 
   On Board Unit (OBU)

      a processing and communication feature that is located in a
      vehicle, which provides an application runtime environment,
      positioning, security and communications functions and interfaces
      to other vehicles including human machine interfaces.  OBU is also
      known as OBE (On-Board Equipment).

   Road Side Unit (RSU)

      equipment located along highways, at traffic intersections and
      other type of locations where timely communications with vehicles
      are needed.  Each RSU includes DSRC (Direct Short Range Radio, 
      e.g., IEEE 802.11p) radio, a positioning system and a router to 
      route packets back through the infrastructure network.  RSU is 
      also known as RSE (Road Side Equipment)

   Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)

      (same as in [draft-ietf-mext-nemo-ro-automotive-req]): a generic
      communication mode in which data packets are exchanged between two
      vehicles, either directly or traversing multiple vehicles, without
      involving any node in the infrastructure.

   Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)

      generic communication mode in which data packets sent by a vehicle
      traverse a communication infrastructure.

   Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V)

      generic communication mode in which data packets received by a
      vehicle traverse a communication infrastructure.

   Host vehicle

      a vehicle that uses the ITS application.

   Traffic safety application

      application that is primarily applied to decrease the probability
      of traffic accidents and the loss of life of the occupants of
      vehicles.

  Geographically-scoped broadcast (or geocast), see [C2C-CC_Manifesto]

      forwarding mechanism that is used to transport data from a single 
      node to all nodes within a target area that is specified by
      geographical positions, e.g. defined by a geographic region. The
      geographic region is determined by a geometric shape, such as 
      circle and rectangle.

   Geographical Unicast (or geounicast) see [C2C-CC_Manifesto]

      Forwarding mechanism that is used for unidirectional data 
      transport from a single node (source) to a single node 
      (destination) by means of direct communication or by multiple hops
      based on georgraphic specific addresses that include node 
      identifier, geographical position, and time information.


   Geographically-scoped anycast (or geoanycast), see [C2C-CC_Manifesto]

      forwarding mechanism that transports data from a single node to 
      any of the nodes within a geographically area. Compared to 
      geographically-scoped broadcast, with geographically-scoped 
      anycast after a packet reaches one vehicle located in the 
      specified geographic area, it stops being forwarded to other 
      vehicles located in the same area.


1.4. Organization of This Document

   This document is organized as follows. Section 2 describes several 
   Geo-networking use cases an scenarios.  Section 3 describes the 
   requirements that need to be fulfilled by the Internet-wide 
   Geo-networking solution. The open design issues are discussed in 
   Section 4. Section 5 describes possible solutions of realizing the 
   Internet-wide Geo-networking solution. Section 6 describes the 
   security considerations. The acknowledgement section is provided in 
   Section 8.

2.  Use cases and scenarios
 
2.1 Scenario

   The scenario that is considered in this document for the support of 
   Internet-wide geo-networking is shown in Figure 1. This scenario 
   shows a source node, which can be located anywhere, and is 
   interconnected with access routers via the Internet. The packets 
   generated by the source are routed through the Internet using the 
   typical destination address based routing up to the access routers. 
   Geo-routing is then used to forward the packets towards the 
   destination area where the recipients are located. In the destination 
   area the packets are geo-broadcasted to all the recipients within the 
   destination area.

2.2 Use cases

   The use cases considered in this section are vehicular networking use 
   cases. However, Internet-wide geo-networking can be applied to any 
   use case that is similar to these vehicular use cases where source 
   nodes anywhere in the Internet are able to geo(broad/any)cast packets 
   to all/any node(s) with geo-location awareness within an arbitrary, 
   source-specified destination area.

   Vehicular networking can be considered as one of the most important
   enabling technologies needed to support various types of traffic
   applications, such as infotainment type of applications, traffic
   efficiency & management and traffic safety applications.

   Traffic safety applications are those that are primarily applied to
   decrease the probability of traffic accidents and the loss of life of
   the occupants of vehicles.  Note that VSC and VSC-A projects focus on
   vehicle-to-vehicle safety.  Another project called CICAS-V
   (Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance Systems - Violation)
   discuss the traffic safety application over vehicle-to-infrastructure
   communication.

   Traffic efficiency & management applications are focusing on
   improving the vehicle traffic flow, traffic coordination and traffic
   assistance.  Moreover, traffic efficiency & management applications
   are focusing on providing updated local information, maps and in
   general messages of relevance limited in space and/or time.

   Infotainment types of applications are the applications that are
   neither traffic safety applications nor traffic efficiency &
   management applications.  Such applications are supported by e.g.,
   media downloading use cases.  
   Such vehicular applications are defined by several initiatives:
      o the USA VSC (Vehicular Safety Communications) and VSC-A (VSC-
        Applications) projects.  

      O the European Car-to-Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) 
        [C2C-CC] and the ETSI TC ITS [ETSI TC ITS], [ETSI-TR-102-638] 
        with the additional support of some EU funded research projects, 
        such as SEVECOM [SEVECOM], SAFESPOT [SAFESPOT], CVIS [CVIS]. 
        PREDRIVE-C2x [PREDRIVE-C2x], GEONET [GEONET].


   The USA Vehicle Safety Communications (VSC) consortium, see
   [VSC], is supported among others by CAMP (Crash Avoidance Metrics
   Partnership).  CAMP is a partnership that has been formed in 1995 by
   Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation.  The objective of
   CAMP is to accelerate the implementation of crash avoidance
   countermeasures to improve traffic safety by investigating and
   developing new technologies.  VSC has been realized in two phases.

   The descriptions of the relevant traffic safety applications are 
   taken from [draft-karagiannis-traffic-safety-requirements].

   The first phase, denoted as VSC started in 2002 and ended in 2004.
   The second phase started in 2006 and ends in 2009.  VSC focused and
   is focusing on traffic safety related applications.  In 2006, The VSC
   2 consortium in cooperation with USDOT initiated a three-year
   collaborative effort in the area of wireless-based safety
   applications under the Vehicle Safety Communications - Applications
   (VSC-A) project, see [VSC-A].  The VSC2 consortium consists of the
   following members; Mercedes-Benz, Ford, General Motors, Honda &
   Toyota.  The main goal of this project is to develop and test
   communications-based vehicle safety systems to determine whether
   vehicle positioning in combination with the DSRC at 5.9 GHz can
   improve the autonomous vehicle-based safety systems and/or enable new
   communication-based safety applications.

   The WAVE Short Message Protocol [IEEE 1609.3] was designed
   specifically to offer a more efficient (smaller size) alternative to
   TCP or UDP over IP, for 1-hop messages that require no routing.  

   The European Car-to-Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) is 
   an industry consortium of car manufacturers and electronics suppliers 
   that focuses on the definition of an European standard for vehicular 
   communication protocols.

   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Technical
   Committee (TC) Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) was established in
   October 2007 with the goal of developing and maintaining standards,
   specifications and other deliverables to support the development and
   the implementation of ITS service provision.

   It is foreseen that ETSI ITS will be the reference standardization 
   body of the future European ITS standards, and actually the C2C-CC 
   provides recommendations to the ETSI TC ITS.

   The following subsections describe use cases that can be implemented 
   using either V2I or V2V. When V2V is applied, the use of Internet-
   wide Geo-networking solution is not required.

   2.2.1 Traffic safety use cases

     In VSC, see [VSC] 34 vehicle application scenarios have been
   identified, evaluated and ranked.  From this evaluation, a subset of
   eight significant near- and mid-term traffic safety applications have
   been selected: (1) cooperative forward collision warning, (2) curve
   speed warning, (3) pre-crash sensing, (4) traffic signal violation
   warning, (5) lane-change warning, (6) emergency electronic brake
   light, (7) left turn assistant, (8) stop sign movement assistant.  A
   brief description of these applications is given below (for more
   details, see [VSC]):

   o  Traffic signal violation warning: it informs and warns the driver
      to stop at a legally prescribed location in the situation that the
      traffic signal indicates a stop and it is estimated that the
      driver will be in violation.

   o  Curve speed warning - Rollover Warning: aids the driver in
      negotiating speeds at appropriate curves.

   o  Emergency Electronic Brake Lights: it is used to inform vehicles
      that a vehicle brakes hard.  In particular in this situation a
      warning message is sent to the vehicles moving behind the vehicle
      that brakes hard.

   o  Pre-crash sensing: it prepares the driver for an unavoidable and
      imminent collision.

   o  Cooperative Forward Collision Warning: aids the driver in
      mitigating or avoiding collisions with the rear-end vehicles in
      the forward path of travel through driver notification or warnings
      of an unavoidable collision.  This application does not attempt to
      control the vehicle to avoid an unavoidable collision.

   o  Left Turn Assistant: it informs the driver about oncoming traffic
      in order to assist him in making a left turn at a signalized
      intersection without a phasing left turn arrow.

   o  Lane Change Warning: it warns the driver if an intended lane
      change may cause a crash with a nearby moving vehicle.

   o  Stop Sign Movement Assistance: it warns the driver that the
      vehicle is nearby an intersection, which will be passed after
      having stopped at a stop sign.

   In the VSC-A project an additional investigation has been performed,
   on traffic safety applications that can be used in crash immitment
   scenarios, see [VSC-A].  The following 7 traffic safety applications
   have been selected for implementation in the VSC-A test bed.

   o  Emergency Electronic Brake Light: is a traffic safety application
      that is the same as the Emergency Electronic Brake Light
      application defined in the VSC project, see above.

   o  Forward Collision warning: is a traffic safety application that is
      the same as the Cooperative Forward Collision Warning application
      defined in the VSC project, see above.

   o  Intersection Movement Assist: is a traffic is intended to warn the
      driver of a vehicle when it is not safe to enter an intersection
      due to high collision probability with other vehicles.  It is
      similar to the Stop Sign Movement Assistance application defined
      in the VSC project, see above.

   o  Blind Spot Warning & Lane Change Warning: it is similar to the
      Lane Change Warning application defined in the VSC project, see
      above.  In the Blind Spot Warning application the driver of a host
      vehicle is informed that another vehicle is moving in an adjacent
      lane and that this vehicle is positioned in a blind spot zone of
      the host vehicle.

   o  Do Not Pass Warning: this is an application that was not
      investigated in the VSC project.  It is intended to warn the
      driver of a host vehicle during a passing maneuver attempt when a
      slower vehicle, ahead and in the same lane, cannot be safely
      passed using a passing zone which is occupied by vehicles with the
      opposite direction of travel. In addition, the application 
      provides advisory information that is intended to inform the 
      driver of the host vehicle that the passing zone is occupied when 
      a passing maneuver is not being attempted.

   o  Control Loss Warning: this is an application that was not
      investigated in the VSC project.  It is intended to enable the
      driver of a host vehicle to generate and broadcast a control- loss
      event to surrounding vehicles.  Upon receiving this information
      the surrounding vehicle determines the relevance of the event and
      provides a warning to the driver, if appropriate.

   The Car to Car Communication Consortium specified a number of traffic 
   safety use cases. The following three are considered as being the 
   main traffic safety use cases, see [C2C-CC_Manifesto]:

     o Cooperative Forward Collision Warning: this use case tries to 
       provide assistance to the driver. Vehicles share (anonymously) 
       information such as position, speed and direction. This enables 
       the prediction of an imminent rear-end collision, by each vehicle 
       monitoring the behavior of its own driver and the information of 
       neighboring vehicles. If a potential risk is detected, the 
       vehicle warns the driver.

Internet-Draft Internet-wide Geo-networking Prob. Stat. November 2013      

       This use case requires: the ability for all vehicles to share 
       Information with each other over a distance of about 20 to 200 
       meters, accurate relative positioning of the vehicles, trust 
       relationships among the vehicles and a reasonable market 
       penetration (at least 10%).

     o Pre-Crash Sensing/Warning: this use case is similar to the 
       previous one, but in this case the collision is identified as 
       unavoidable, and then the involved vehicles exchange more precise 
       information to optimize the usage of actuators such as airbags, 
       seat belt pre-tensors, etc...
       This use case requires basically the same abilities that the 
       previous one, restricting the needed communication range to 20 to 
       100 meters, and adding the requirement of a fast and reliable 
       connection between the involved cars.

     o Hazardous Location V2V Notification: this use case is based on 
       the share of information that relates to dangerous locations on 
       the road, among vehicles, and also among vehicles and the road 
       infrastructure. 
       On one hand, vehicles may detect the dangerous locations from 
       sensors in the vehicle or from events such as the actuation of 
       the ESP (Electronic Stability Program). 
       On the other hand, recipients of this information may use it to 
       properly configure active safety systems and/or warn the driver.
       This use case requires: vehicles to trust other vehicles and 
       roadside units, reasonable market penetration, the ability of 
       vehicles to share information about a specific geographic 
       location over multiple-hops and the ability to validate 
       information propagated through multiple hops.

   2.2.2 Traffic efficiency and management use cases

     Such applications are focusing on improving the vehicle traffic 
     flow, traffic coordination and traffic assistance and provide 
     updated local information, maps and in general, messages of 
     relevance bounded in space and/or time. Two typical groups of this 
     type of applications are speed management and co-operative 
     navigation are two typical groups of this type of applications 
     [ETSI-TR-102-638], [KaAl11].
     o) Speed management:
     Speed management applications aim to assist the driver to manage 
     the speed of his/her vehicle for smooth driving and to avoid 
     unnecessary stopping. Regulatory/contextual speed limit 
     notification and green light optimal speed advisory are two 
     examples of this type.

     o) Co-operative navigation
     This type of applications is used to increase the traffic 
     efficiency by managing the navigation of vehicles through 
     cooperation among vehicles and through cooperation between vehicles 
     and road side units. Some examples of this type are traffic 
     information and recommended itinerary provisioning, co-operative 
     adaptive cruise control and platooning.

   2.2.3 Infotainment Applications
   
   Such applications are neither traffic safety applications nor traffic 
   efficiency & management applications and are mainly supported by 
   e.g., media downloading use cases, see [CVIS], [C2C-CC_Manifesto], 
   [ETSI-TR-102-638], [PREDRIVE-C2x], [KaAl11]:

   o) Co-operative local services
   This type of applications focus on infotainment that can be obtained 
   from locally based services such as point of interest notification, 
   local electronic commerce and media downloading.

   o) Global Internet services
   In this type of applications the focus is on data that can be 
   obtained from global Internet services. Typical examples are 
   Communities services, which include insurance and financial services, 
   fleet management and parking zone management, and ITS station life 
   cycle, which focus on software and data updates.

    o) large number of active sources

4. Open Design Issues 

   This section describes the Internet wide geo-networking open design 
   issues that can be addressed by the IETF. 

4.1 Geo-addressing in the wired Internet

   The Standard Internet routers are not aware of geo-networking 
   functionality. Therefore, the used addresses used must be regular 
   addresses that route to / via the Access Router. 
   In particular, regarding unicast and multicast addresses the 
   following issues can be identified.

   o) Using unicast addresses for all destination areas: does not scale 
      well and packets are sent multiple times on the wireless interface
   o) Unicast addresses of relevant access routers: can be realized by 
      using e.g., tunneling.
   o) Using multicast addresses to specify destination areas: A standard 
      router should be able to route packets that are using predefined 
      multicast addresses. This implies that an arbitrary, 
      source-specified destination area cannot be coded this way. 
      Alternatively, packets could be sent to a set of predefined areas 
      which together include the source-specified destination area 
      (further filtering at destination). However, consider that one 
      multicast address per access point is needed. Consider also that 
      each access point provides radio coverage to an area of 300m x 
      300m, which is approximately equal to 10^5 m^2. This would require 
      that on a global scale we will need: 5 * 10^14 / 10^5 = 5 * 10^9 
      multicast addresses to cover the earth, which will need to be 
      maintained by the routing table of a router. This is far too many 
      addresses that can be maintained by nowadays routers in their 
      routing tables. A solution could be to define larger predefined 
      areas. In this case however, many useless packet transmissions 
      will need to be supported. It can be, therefore, deduced that the 
      normal use of multicast addresses does not scale. Meaning that 
      other solutions are needed, such (1) aggregation of multicast 
      addresses into "larger" multicast addresses, (2) support of a 
      routing hierarchy for geocasting.

Internet-Draft Internet-wide Geo-networking Prob. Stat. November 2013      

4.2 Exchanging destination area information

   Until all routers in the Internet are geo-aware, or until a 
   sufficient level of multicast address aggregation has been achieved 
   to have a manageable total number of multicast addresses, we need a 
   way for the source node to reach the (right) first geo-aware access 
   router, e.g., RSU, (over the standard Internet). In addition to that 
   the destination area specification needs to be exchanged at this 
   first geo-aware access router.  This can be achieved only if 
   there is precise knowledge about the location of this destination 
   node. The destination area specification has to be carried in the 
   packet, using one of the following options: 
      o) Specify this information in the IP destination address 
         (tunneled in wired Internet)
      o) Use IP header extensions (not processed by standard Internet 
         routers)
      o) Carry this information in the application layer header

4.3 Lookup and translation of destination area to IP address

   When a source needs to disseminate information in a destination 
   area it should lookup and translate the destination area into a 
   standard IPv6 address of the first geo-aware access router, e.g., 
   RSU, which is routable in the standard Internet. 
   The destination area can be specified by an application at the 
   source, and does not have to coincide with known (predefined) areas, 
   e.g., corresponding with the coverage area of an AR (e.g., RSU), or 
   with the area covered by a predefined multicast address. This can be 
   realized using location databases that provide the mapping between 
   the destination area and the IPv6 address of the first geo-aware 
   access router, e.g., RSU. Examples of such location databases are: 

   o) Application specific location database
   o) DNS extended with location records and queries
   o) Table of known multicast addresses

4.4 Updating the location database

   The location databases that stores the mapping between the    
   destination areas and the IPv6 addresses of the first geo-aware 
   access router, e.g., RSU, need to be dynamically maintained and be up 
   to date. Meaning that whenever new destination areas are identified 
   or when the mapping between the stored destination areas and the 
   associated IPv6 addresses change the location database needs to be 
   updated.

4.5 Support of Internet-wide geo-routing

  By using Internet-wide geo-routing the data packets that are generated 
  by source nodes placed anywhere in the Internet are able to be 
  forwarded over multiple hops by using the position of the destination 
  node(s) and the positions of intermediate nodes for the routing 
  decisions.

Internet-Draft Internet-wide Geo-networking Prob. Stat. November 2013      

  Several geo-routing protocols have been defined by other 
  standardization bodies, e.g., ETSI ITS, however, these geo-routing  
  protocols are not designed for Internet-wide geo-networking.

5. Possible solutions

   This section presents two possible ways of how the Intern-wide geo-
   networking solution can be designed. These solutions are the extended 
   DNS and GeoServer. The extended DNS solution uses GPS coordinates to 
   address geo-location. However, also other types of coordinates, such 
   as the Galileo coordinates could be used for this purpose.

5.1 Extended DNS 

   One of the ingredients for Internet-wide geo-networking is a 
   (distributed) database, able to resolve a geographical area to 
   relevant IP addresses. Source nodes wishing to send geo-networking    
   packets can then resolve the destination area of (a flow of) packets 
   to a number of IP addresses, and send the packets to these 
   destination addresses.

   One direction for solutions is to extend the DNS system for this 
   purpose, see [FiHe11].  Rather than modifying the DNS protocol, 
   requiring new top level domains or requiring changes in the routing 
   behavior of today's Internet, this proposal is relying on the use DNS 
   LOC (location) resource records defined in the [RFC1876]. Through the 
   use of LOC records, geographical information about hosts, networks, 
   and subnets can be stored in the DNS files. By performing then 
   forward DNS lookups, geographical information about hosts or domains 
   can be obtained. Current implementation of DNS, such as NSD, support 
   LOC records to be inserted in the master file. This LOC record can 
   then be used to specify the location of an end-host, the coverage 
   area of an access router or access point, or the area in which the 
   members of a multicast group are spread.
   The key point in this proposal is the use of LOC records as primary 
   key in the forward DNS lookup in order to return IP addresses 
   associated with geographical locations. In other words, we introduce 
   a new primary key into DNS besides the already existing ones 
   (hostnames and IP addresses). The extended version of DNS extends the 
   DNS server with capabilities to handle queries for an area within a 
   domain. Upon receiving a query with such a specified area, the 
   extended DNS server should return resource records for all names for 
   which the area specified in a LOC record overlaps with the area 
   specified in the query, and are also sub-domains of the domain 
   specified in the query.
   These addresses can then be used by the source as destination address 
   for its geocast packets.
   A possible format for a query is to replace the lowest-level 
   subdomain by a location description:

   "("dlat [mlat [slat [mslat]]] "N"|"S" dlon [mlon [ slon [ mslon]]] 
   "E"|"W" alt["m"] size["m"]")".domain

              Figure 2: The extended DNS scenario 

   Here, dlat, mlat, slat and mslat specify the latitude of the center 
   of the destination area in degree, minute, second, and millisecond, 
   North ("N") or South ("S") respectively. Similarly, dlon, mlon, slon 
   and mslon specify the longitude of the center of the destination area 
   in degree, minute, second, and millisecond East ("E") or West ("W") 
   respectively. Further, alt is the altitude in meters; size the 
   (radius) size of the destination area in meters and domain specifies 
   the domain to search in. Such an approach scopes geographical queries 
   to a certain domain. In order to allow for name servers to delegate 
   location queries to servers responsible for subdomains, for each 
   delegated subdomain the latter servers must maintain a bounding box 
   of their subdomains and make sure that also their parent server has 
   its up-to-date bounding box. To this end, a new record type (Bounding 
   Box) BND is used in this proposal.
   Dynamic DNS update, as specified in [RFC2136] can be used to update 
   BND and LOC records. Different levels of granularity are possible 
   w.r.t. location representation in DNS.

   If LOC records are stored for individual end-
   hosts, a significant load for dynamic updates of LOC records may be  
   caused by mobile nodes. Alternatively, (stationary) access routers or 
   access points may store a LOC record specifying their coverage area, 
   and forward geocast packets to their coverage area. As a third 
   alternative, multicast addresses may be used to represent areas, 
   allowing host to subscribe to an area-specific multicast address 
   ([GEONET]).
   Note: if the destination location is somehow specified in the packet, 
   additional packet filtering can be done by destination hosts, using 
   their exact, current location.

5.1.1 Dynamic IP address-to-geographical Address Resolution

   A method similar to the name resolution (DNS) method can be provided. 
   The user of this method may query a server in this way: 
   it provides an IP address and it obtains in return the geographical 
   coordinates of where the interface assigned that IP address is 
   situated, or vice-versa. The method should also work for groups of IP 
   addresses (prefixes) and three-dimensional regions. 

5.2 GeoServer

   A design approach for Internet-wide geo-networking is to introduce a 
   new network element that serves as a message reflector to facilitate 
   the communication among vehicles. This network element functions as a 
   server. It processes incoming messages from each vehicle, aggregates 
   these messages when appropriate, and redistributes the messages to 
   other vehicles. Since this server is typically responsible for a 
   geographical area, it is termed GeoServer. The main functionality of 
   a GeoServer is to provide vehicles with geographical-related services 
   such as for traffic safety and traffic efficiency & management and 
   infotainment-type of applications. The GeoServer is linked to an 
   application server; both might be co-located. The application 
   scenario is illustrated in Figure 3.
   Applications may work vehicle or AppServer-triggered. In a typical 
   vehicle-triggered scenario, the vehicle may detect road works or 
   an obstacle by any means (local sensors, communication over other 
   media or user input), triggers a message and sends it to the 
   GeoServer. 
   The GeoServer can either forwards the messages directly to the 
   destination area or involve the AppServer for information aggregation 
   before forwarding the data.  In the GeoServer-triggered scenario, the 
   application server acts as originator of a message, based on data 
   aggregation or information from a traffic management center or static 
   configuration.

   The scenario requires three main communication tasks [ITSWC2012], 
   [WANG2013]: location updates, event reporting and geographical 
   messaging (GeoMessaging). Location updates are periodically sent from 
   the vehicle to the GeoServer.  Their transmission can be triggered 
   query-based, time-based, distance-based, grid-based (or a 
   combination) (see [ITSWC2011]). If the driver or the vehicle detects 
   an event, then the event will be reported to the GeoServer.

   The GeoServer enables the distribution of messages to vehicles in  
   a geographical area.  The GeoServer also takes care of periodic re-
   transmission of the warning during the lifetime of the event, i.e. 
   the repetition of the messages in order to keep the information alive 
   in the destination area when vehicles start their journey or enter 
   the area.

6.  Security Considerations 
    
   According to requirement 3.8.1, the Internet-wide geo-networking 
   solution MUST support security objectives for all supported 
   communication modes. Security objectives particularly include 
   integrity, privacy and non-repudiation and SHOULD protect the network 
   and transport layer protocol headers. In addition the Internet-wide 
   geo-networking solution MUST also protect privacy, i.e. provide 
   confidentiality to personal data such as node identifier and 
   location.
    
7.  IANA Considerations  
   No IANA considerations are considered in this document.
