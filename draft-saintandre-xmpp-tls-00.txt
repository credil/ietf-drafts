Internet-Draft                  XMPP TLS                  September 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120]
   (along with its precursor, the so-called "Jabber protocol") has used
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (along with its precursor,
   Secure Sockets Layer or SSL) since 1999.  Both [RFC6120] and its
   predecessor [RFC3920] provided recommendations regarding the use of
   TLS in XMPP.  Given the evolving threat model on the Internet today
   (see, for example, [I-D.trammell-perpass-ppa]), it is necessary to
   provide stronger recommendations (see also [I-D.sheffer-tls-bcp]).
   This document updates [RFC6120].


2.  Terminology

   Various security-related terms are to be understood in the sense
   defined in [RFC4949].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Discussion Venue

   The discussion venue for this document is the mailing list of the
   XMPP Working Group, for which archives and subscription information
   can be found at <https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/xmpp>.


4.  Recommendations

4.1.  Protocol Versions

   XMPP implementations MUST NOT negotiate SSL version 2 [RFC6176].

   XMPP implementations MUST NOT negotiate SSL version 3.

   XMPP implementations MUST support, and prefer to negotiate, TLS
   version 1.2 [RFC5246].

   XMPP implementations MAY negotiate TLS version 1.1 [RFC4346].

   XMPP implementations MAY negotiate TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246].

4.2.  Ciphersuites

   XMPP implementations MUST NOT negotiate RC4 ciphersuites
   [I-D.popov-tls-prohibiting-rc4].

   XMPP implementations MUST NOT negotiate ciphersuites that use so-
   called "export-level" encryption (including 40-bit and 56-bit
   algorithms).

   XMPP implementations MUST NOT negotiate ciphersuites that use less
   than 128-bit algorithms.

   XMPP implementations SHOULD prefer ciphersuites that use 256-bit
   algorithms or higher.

   XMPP implementations MUST support, and SHOULD prefer to negotiate,
   ciphersuites that offer perfect forward secrecy, such as those in the
   "EDH", "DHE", and "ECDH" families.


5.  Open Issues

   This document has the following open issues:

   o  Add information about the rationale for each recommendation,
      perhaps in an appendix.
   o  Recommend a specific ciphersuite or a small number of
      ciphersuites?
   o  Provide recommendations regarding key lengths?
   o  Discuss TLS compression vs. application-layer compression?


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no actions of the IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   This entire document discusses security.
