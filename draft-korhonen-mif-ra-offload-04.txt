Internet-Draft             Traffic Offloading                 March 2012


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an extension to Neighbor Discovery
   Protocol [RFC4861], which allows management of IPv4 traffic
   offloading for multi-interface dual-stack capable hosts and moving
   IPv4 traffic away from a specific interface.

   The described solution is intended to be used during transition
   towards IPv6, during which time multi-interfaced hosts are often
   likely to have network interfaces with IPv4-only capability.  A
   common scenario where coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 network interfaces
   is expected to occur is when a smartphone has IPv6-enabled cellular
   connection and IPv4-only WLAN connection active at the same time.


2.  Requirements and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Background

   Current Internet hosts generally prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4
   addresses when performing source and destination address selections,
   as is recommended in [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484bis].

   A multi-interfaced host may have IPv6 enabled on a more 'expensive'
   interface and a 'cheaper' interface may have support only for IPv4.
   In such a scenario it might be desirable for hosts to prefer IPv4 in
   communication instead of IPv6.

   The above mentioned scenario can become a problem, for example, when
   a smartphone has simultaneously IPv6-enabled cellular connection
   ([RFC6459]) and IPv4-only WLAN connectivity active.  When connecting
   to dual-stack capable destinations it would oftentimes be generally
   more efficient to use WLAN network interface.  Furthermore, a
   cellular network operator may want hosts to offload traffic away from
   cellular network whenever hosts have alternate network accesses
   available.

   Similar issue can arise also when a host has multiple interfaces with
   IPv4 connectivity.  The interface that provides better performance at
   a lower price should oftentimes be used for the communication, but it
   may not be clear for a host which one of the available interfaces it
   should prefer.

4.  Solution

   This document introduces a new Neighbor Discovery option that a
   network can use to communicate router's willingness to act as a
   default gateway for IPv4 traffic and IPv4 offloading information for
   specific routes.

   The new Neighbor Discovery option was chosen to support hosts without
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] and DHCPv4 Classless Static Route Option [RFC3442]
   support and also to work on networks not utilizing DHCPv6 and DHCPv4.

   The new Neighbor Discovery option shall be phased out when IPv4 usage
   diminishes.

4.1.  Neighbor Discovery Offload Option

   This specification defines a new Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] option
   called Offload (Type TBD) to be used in Router Advertisements.  The
   option is illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2.  Routers and hosts
   implementing this specification MUST understand the Offload option.

   Length

      8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including the
      Type and Length fields) is in units of 8 octets.  The Length field
      depends on the optional Specific Route Information.  If there is
      no Specific Route Information, the Length must be 2.

   D (IPv4 Gateway Preference)

      Indicates the willingness of the Dual-Stack capable router (who
      originated the Router Advertisement) to serve as a gateway for the
      IPv4 traffic.  If 'D' is unset (0) then the router indicates no
      specific to be or not to be a gateway for IPv4 traffic.  If 'D' is
      set (1) then the router explicitly indicates it is not willing to
      serve as a gateway for IPv4 traffic if there are other usable
      gateways present in the same or other available interfaces.

   Reserved

      Unused field.  It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   IPv4 Gateway

      The address of a dual-stack router's IPv4 interface which is used
      as the next-hop from hosts point of view for sending and receiving
      IPv4 traffic on this link.  The IPv4 address MUST belong to the
      same interface that originated the Router Advertisement containing
      this Offload option.  If the router is IPv6 only, this field MUST
      be set to unspecified address (0.0.0.0) or the Neighbor Discovery
      Offload option MUST be omitted in all Router Advertisements
      originated by the router.

   GW Lifetime

      16-bit unsigned integer.  The Lifetime in seconds limits the
      validity of state changes caused by this new option.  The value of
      Lifetime in this option SHOULD be smaller than the value of Router
      Lifetime contained in the header of the same Router
      Advertisement[RFC4191].

   Specific Route Information

      Optional information for IPv4 offloading to specific routes.  The
      format is illustrated in Figure 2.  An Offload option can contain
      multiple specific route entries.

                   Figure 2: Specific Route Information

   Route Lifetime

      16-bit unsigned integer.  The length of time in seconds (relative
      to the time the packet is sent) that the IPv4 prefix is valid for
      route determination.  The value of Route Lifetime SHOULD be
      smaller than the value of GW Lifetime contained in the same
      Offload option.

   Prf (Route Preference)

      2-bit signed integer.  The preference values are encoded as
      follows: 00 for High; 00 for Medium (default); 11 for Low; and 10
      for Reserved which MUST NOT be sent.  The Route Preference
      indicates whether to prefer the router associated with this prefix
      over others, when multiple identical prefixes for different
      routers have been received.

   Resvd (Reserved)

      6-bit unused field.  It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender
      and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Prefix Length

      8-bit unsigned integer.  The number of leading bits in the IPv4
      Prefix field that are valid.  The value ranges from 0 to 32.

   IPv4 Prefix

      The IPv4 Prefix field contains an IPv4 address.  The Prefix Length
      field contains the number of valid leading bits in the prefix.
      The bits in the prefix after the prefix length (if any) are

      reserved and MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and ignored
      by the receiver.

   Each Specific Route entry is in the length of 8 octets, containing
   Route Lifetime, Route Preference, Prefix Length, and IPv4 Prefix.
   Multiple Specific Route entries can be contained within the same
   Offload option.

   The behavior of 'IPv4 Gateway Preference' is discussed in more detail
   in the following sections (see Section 4.2).  The usage of 'IPv4
   Gateway' for offloading is discussed in Section 4.4 and Section 4.3.
   The Offload option is used only in Router Advertisements.

4.2.  Lowering IPv4 Router Preference

   The 'D' flag bit in the Offload option indicates the willingness of a
   Dual-Stack capable router originating the Router Advertisement to
   serve as a gateway for IPv4 traffic.  If 'D' is set (1), the router
   indicates that it SHOULD NOT be used as a gateway for IPv4 traffic,
   if other gateways are present in the same or other available
   interfaces.  If 'D' is unset (0), the router does not indicate any
   preference of being or not being a gateway for IPv4 traffic.  When
   'D' is unset (0), the decision of temporarily modifying the routing
   status is left for hosts that receive the Offload option (see
   Section 4.3 and Section 4.4).  The 'IPv4 Gateway' field in the
   Offload option contains the IPv4 address of the Dual-Stack interface
   that originated the Router Advertisement.  The address serves as the
   identification of the next-hop IPv4 router.

4.3.  IPv4 Offloading to Default Gateway

   If there is no Specific Route Information in the Offload option, the
   default gateway for IPv4 offloading can be added, updated, or deleted
   depending on the 'D' flag, GW Lifetime, and existing routing status
   on the hosts.  When 'D' is set (1), the existing default gateway
   matching to the advertised one SHOULD be removed if there are other
   usable gateways present in the same or other available interfaces.

   When 'D' is unset (0) and there is no default gateway present for the
   receiving interface, the advertised IPv4 Gateway with valid lifetime
   can be added.  If the advertised gateway matches to the existing one
   on the host, depending on the advertised lifetime, the existing
   lifetime of default gateway shall be updated to the advertised GW
   Lifetime in Offload option or deleted if the GW Lifetime is set 0.
   If there is a default gateway existing on the receiving interface,
   which does not match to the advertised gateway, the advertised one
   SHOULD be ignored.

4.4.  IPv4 Offloading to Specific Routes

   To enable IPv4 traffic offloading to specific routes, Specific Route
   Information MUST present in the same Offload option.  A host
   receiving such Router Advertisement needs to maintain a set of status
   including the IPv4 Gateway, IPv4 Prefix, Prefix Length, Route
   Preference, and Route Lifetime.  The Route Preference in the Offload
   option indicates whether to prefer the IPv4 router associated with
   this prefix over others.  The Route Lifetime in the Offload option
   determines how long the temporarily added specific route will be
   valid.

   When 'D' flag is unset (0) in the Offload option, the advertised
   Specific Route Information shall be added by hosts if there is no
   duplicated IPv4 prefix matching to the advertised IPv4 prefix and the
   advertised Route Lifetime in Offload option is valid.  If there is a
   matching prefix, such specific route will be updated or deleted
   according to the status of Route Lifetime and Route Preference.  The
   Route Lifetime in Offload option determines whether the route will be
   deleted or updated depending on the existing routing status of the
   hosts.  If the advertised Route Lifetime is set to 0, any matched
   IPv4 prefix and corresponding gateway MUST be removed.  If Lifetime
   is valid, the Route Preference further determines whether the IPv4
   Gateway for the existing prefix, if matched, will be substituted to
   the advertised one, or the lifetime for existing route will be
   updated.

   When 'D' flag is set (1) in the Offload option, any existing specific
   routes with the next-hop router matching to the advertised IPv4
   Gateway SHOULD be removed.

   To avoid misconfiguration of offloading operation, only one Offload
   option is allowed in a single Router Advertisement.

4.5.  Offload Lifetime

   The GW Lifetime in the Offload option determines the valid period of
   temporary routing changes including IPv4 Gateway and offloading IPv4
   traffic to specific routes.  If a router sends a new Router
   Advertisement without the Offload option before the existing lifetime
   of this router expires, it is an indication for the receiving hosts
   that any existing state/information caused by previous Offload option
   MUST be removed.


5.  Router Behavior

   A router configuration SHOULD allow network administrator to add and



Korhonen, et al.       Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             Traffic Offloading                 March 2012


   configure this option into Router Advertisement messages.  The
   configuration can be selectively enabled (the Offload option is
   included in the Router Advertisement) or disabled (the Offload option
   is not included in the Router Advertisement).


6.  Host Behavior

   A multi-interface capable host SHOULD monitor presence of Offload
   option in Router Advertisements received.  When an Offload option is
   received, the IPv4 Gateway Preference and offloading status for this
   router shall be temporarily updated as described in 4.2 and 4.3.
   Depending on the presence of Specific Route Information in the same
   Offload option, the status of offloading IPv4 traffic to specific
   routes shall be temporarily updated as described in 4.4.  Hosts
   SHOULD refer to both GW Lifetime and Route Lifetime (if present) in
   the Offload option to determine the valid time of routing changes
   caused by the Router Advertisement received.

   If the host receives a Router Advertisement without the Offload
   option and there is an existing state created by an earlier received
   Offload option, then the host MUST remove all IPv4 gateway
   preferences and offloading modifications from the previous Router
   Advertisement.  The removals concerns the prefixes configured from
   router where the router advertisement was received.


7.  Security Considerations

   The Offload option allows malicious hosts and routers to affect a
   victim host's next hop and default address selection if spoofing of
   Router Advertisements are possible on the access link.  This is a
   well-known and understood security threat [RFC3756] and can be
   mitigated using, for example, Secure Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971].
   The security of utilizing the Offload option is at the equal level to
   solution in [RFC4191].


8.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new Neighbor Discovery option described
   in Section 4.1.

A.1.  Modification to Default Address Selection

   The 'lower-than-IPv4 Preference' affects the Source Address Selection
   Rule 3.  The notation Lower(SA) returns true if the address SA was
   configured from the prefixes advertised by a 'lower-than-IPv4
   Preference' router.  Lower(SA) returns false is the address SA was
   configured from prefixes advertised by other than 'lower-than-IPv4
   Preference' router.  The notation Default(D) returns false if the
   address D has more specific routes (i.e. other than the default
   route).  Default(D) returns true if the address D points only to a
   default route.  The modified Rule 3 would be as follows:

   Rule 3:  Avoid deprecated addresses.

      The addresses SA and SB have the same scope.  If Lower(SA) == true
      and Default(D) == true, then mark SA temporarily as "deprecated".
      If Lower(SB) == true and Default(D) == true, then mark SB
      temporarily as "deprecated".  If one of the two source addresses
      is "preferred" and one of them is "deprecated" (in the [RFC4862]
      sense), then prefer the one that is "preferred."

   Similar modification also concerns the Destination Address Selection
   Rule 3 when checking whether a candidate source address for a given
   destination is deprecated.

A.2.  Address selection examples

   Link-local addresses are omitted in all following examples.  The
   assumption is that possible destinations have a global scope and all
   IPv6 enabled interfaces have at least one global scope IPv6 address.
   Therefore, the default address selection would always output global
   scope addresses over link-local addresses.

A.2.1.  Case 1: IPv6-only cellular and IPv4-only WLAN accesses

   A host has obtained global IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, on a cellular
   interface and with it has received Neighbor Discovery option with
   'lower-than-IPv4' preference.  The host also has global IPv4 address,
   192.0.2.2, on a WLAN interface.

   When connecting to a dual-stack enabled destination, both 2001:db8::2
   and 192.0.2.2 are considered as source addresses candidates.  IPv4
   address is selected, because 2001:db8::2 is considered deprecated.
   Hence host uses WLAN for communication.

   When connecting to IPv6-only destination, 2001:db8::2 is selected and
   cellular network used, as there are no other IPv6 addresses
   available.

A.2.2.  Case 2: WLAN access with multiple prefixes

   A host has obtained two global IPv6 addresses, one of which was from
   a router indicating 'lower-than-IPv4' preference.  For example, 2001:
   db8:1::2 from router with 'lower-than-IPv4' preference and
   2001:db8:2::3 from router without any special preferences.

   When connecting to IPv6-only destination, both addresses are
   considered as source address candidates.  Source address selection
   chooses 2001:db8:2::3 as 2001:db8:1::2 is considered deprecated
   (Lower(2001:db8::2) == true and Default(D) == true).

A.2.3.  Case 3: WLAN and cellular interface with cellular's IPv4 not
        default route

   A host has obtained IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, and IPv4 address,
   192.0.2.2, from cellular network.  The network has indicated 'lower-
   than-IPv4' preference for IPv6 and 'not your default router' for
   IPv4.  The host also has dual-stack WLAN access with 2001:db8:1::3
   and 192.0.2.30 addresses.

   When connecting to IPv4-only destination, host selects 192.0.2.30 as
   source address because default gateway on the interface of 192.0.2.2
   address is 'not default gateway'.  WLAN is used for communication.

   When connecting to IPv6-only destination, host selects 2001:db8:1::3
   from WLAN interface as the 2001:db8::2 is considered deprecated
   (Lower(2001:db8::2) == true and Default(D) == true).  WLAN is used
   for communication.

   When connecting to dual-stack destination, host selects from the four
   candidate addresses 2001:db8:1::3, as IPv6 is preferred in general
   and as that address is not deprecated.  WLAN is used for
   communication.

A.2.4.  Case 4: Dual-stack cellular access

   A host has obtained IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, and IPv4 address,
   192.0.2.2, from cellular network.  The network has indicated 'lower-
   than-IPv4' preference.

   When connecting to a dual-stack enabled destination, both addresses
   are considered as candidate source addresses.  IPv4 address is
   chosen, because IPv6 address is considered deprecated.

A.2.5.  Case 5: Dual-stack cellular and single stack WLAN

   A host has obtained IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, and IPv4 address,
   192.0.2.2, from cellular network.  The network has indicated 'lower-
   than-IPv4' preference for IPv6 and 'not your default router' for
   IPv4.  The host also has WLAN access with 192.0.2.30 address.

   When connecting to dual-stack destination, all three addresses are
   considered as source address candidates.  The IPv4 address from WLAN,
   192.0.2.30, is selected as the IPv6 address, 2001:db8::2, is
   considered deprecated and as the IPv4 default route points to WLAN.
   Hence WLAN is used for communication.

A.2.6.  Case 6: Coexistence with RFC4191

   A host has obtained IPv6 address, 2001:db8:1::2/64 from cellular
   network.  The network has indicated 'lower-than-IPv4' preference for
   IPv6 and a more specific route to 2001:db8:2::/48.  The host also has
   IPv6 WLAN access with 2001:db8:3::3/64 address.

   When connecting to 2001:db8:2::1 the host selects 2001:db8:1::2 from
   cellular interface as a source address, because Lower(2001:db8:1::2)
   == true and Default(2001:db8:2::1) == false and hence the
   2001:db8:1::2 is not considered as deprecated address even though
   'lower-than-IPv4' preference was advertised.

   When connecting to 2001:db8:4::1 the host selects 2001:db8:3::3 from
   WLAN interface as a source address, because Lower(2001:db8:2::1) ==
   true and Default(2001:db8:3::3) == true) and hence 2001:db8:2::1 is
   considered as deprecated address.
