                        draft-xu-ite-lisp-00.txt

Abstract

   EID-to-RLOC (Endpoint Identifier to Routing Locators) mapping system
   is one of the cornerstones for LISP (Location/Identifier Separation
   Protocol) networks.  This document discusses one solution to support
   ingress traffic engineering by controlling the EID-to-RLOC mappings
   in LISP networks as response to dynamic network status.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes one solution to support ingress traffic
   engineering in [LISP] networks, including the related network
   elements and the messages sent.  This is based on the assumption that
   the EID-to-RLOC mappings or at least part of them could be adjusted
   according to the changing network status based on the traffic
   engineering requirements.

   There are two kinds of EID-to-RLOC mappings.  One is fixed, i.e., the
   owner of the EID wants the traffic to the endpoint being imported
   into local network through the specified ETR (Egress Tunnel Router)
   for its own reasons such as security and cost considerations.  One is
   adjustable, i.e. the owner of the EID does not care which ETR is
   selected as its ingress router.

   As discussed in [Xu], one particular entry for one EID to one RLOC
   could be input into the database in ETR through manually configuring
   or be adjusted according to traffic engineering requirements.  One
   control unit as well as other network elements needed to support
   ingress traffic engineering is discussed.

   The solution discussed in this document could coexist with different
   LISP mapping system, such as [LISP-alt], [LISP-ms], [LISP-nerd],
   [LISP-dht] and [LISP-cons].

                               LISP networks

2.1.   Control Unit

   The Control Unit doesn't belong to any particular ISP (Internet
   Service Provider).  The control unit chooses the appropriate RLOCs
   for EIDs.  Based on the traffic engineering requirements and network
   status information received from TE agent-ISPs, Control Unit makes
   the final decisions about the EID-to-RLOC mappings and sends the
   final global decisions back to the appropriate ETRs through the
   appropriate TE agent-ISPs.

2.2.  TE-agent-ISP

   There is one TE-agent-ISP in each ISP.  It exchanges information with
   Control unit, ETRs of local ISP and TE-agent-nets of the stub
   networks attached to the ISP.

   TE-agent-ISP receives the traffic engineering requirements as well as
   network status from TE-agent-nets of stub networks which are attached
   to the ISP.

   For the problem of choosing an appropriate ETR (RLOC) from multiple
   ETRs of local ISP, TE-agent-ISP makes the decision based on the
   requirement(s) and status, and sends the final local decision to the
   appropriate ETR of local ISP as well as Control Unit.

Internet-Draft      LISP Ingress Traffic Engineering         August 2011


   For the problem of choosing an appropriate ETR (RLOC) from multiple
   ETRs of different ISPs, TE-agent-ISP sends the requirements to
   Control Unit and forwards the received the final global decision from
   Control Unit to the appropriate ETR of local ISP if applicable.

   For the register request of fixed EID-to-RLOC mappings, TE-agent-ISP
   sends the request to the appropriate ETR of local ISP directly.

2.3.  TE-agent-net

   There are one or more TE-agent-nets in each local stub networks.  It
   collects traffic engineering requirements from the network
   administrator and end users who want to have a say in its own EID-to-
   RLOC mapping.

   It also collects the network status, e.g., the load status of each
   links and the traffic statistics between nodes, and sends such
   information as well as TE requirements to the TE-agent-ISPs of the
   ISP(s) which provides Internet access service for local network.

2.4.  ETR

   Egress Tunnel Router as defined in [LISP] is responsible for
   maintaining (registering and unregistering mappings) the database of
   EID-to-RLOC mappings, including fixed EID-to-RLOC mappings and
   adjustable ones.


3.  Workflow of registering fixed EID-to-RLOC mapping

   The administrator of local network or the owner of the endpoint sends
   the fixed EID-to-RLOC register request to TE-agent-net of local
   network.

   TE-agent-net of local network sends the request to the TE-agent-ISP
   of the ISP to which the specified RLOC belongs.

   TE-agent-ISP of the ISP sends the request to the appropriate ETR,
   which holds the specified RLOC.

   The ETR registers the fixed EID-to-RLOC mapping into the database.


4.  Workflow of unregistering fixed EID-to-RLOC mapping

   The administrator of local network or the owner of the endpoint sends
   the unregistering request for one fixed EID-to-RLOC mapping to TE-
   agent-net of local network.

Internet-Draft      LISP Ingress Traffic Engineering         August 2011


   TE-agent-net of local network sends the unregister request to the TE-
   agent-ISP of the ISP to which the specified RLOC belongs.

   TE-agent-ISP of the ISP sends the request to the appropriate ETR,
   which holds the specified mapping.

   The ETR removes (unregisters) the particular mapping entry from the
   database.


5.  Workflow of registering changeable EID-to-RLOC mapping

   Changeable EID-to-RLOC mappings could be registered or adjusted as
   response to changing network status such as ingress traffic demands
   and traffic volumes between nodes.

   The changing status as well as TE requirements of one stub network is
   sent by TE-agent-net of this network, to one or multiple TE-agent-
   ISPs which local network is attached to,

   Two possible cases should be considered.  One is that local stub
   network is attached to only one ISP through multiple intradomain
   links.  In this case, TE-agent-ISP is responsible for choosing
   appropriate RLOC, i.e., the corresponding ETR of local ISP, for each
   EID.

   Another is that local stub network is attached to multiple ISPs.  In
   this case, the final selection of appropriate RLOC (of some ETR in
   one ISP) for one EID should be done by Control Unit.

   Based on the status information collected, TE-agent-ISP or Control
   Unit selects appropriate RLOC for one EID according to TE
   requirements received.  TE-agent-ISP sends its decision to the
   appropriate ETR and Control Unit.  And Control Unit sends its
   decision to the appropriate TE-agent-ISP while the latter forwards
   this information to the appropriate ETR.


6.  Workflow of adjusting changeable EID-to-RLOC mapping

   TE-agent-ISP as well as Control Unit monitors network status and
   changes part of EID-to-RLOC mappings if necessary.

   Unregister request is sent to the ETR which holds the old mapping.
   Meanwhile, the new mapping information is sent to the appropriate
   ETR.
