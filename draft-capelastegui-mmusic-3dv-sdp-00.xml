			<t>This document defines a mechanism to describe 3D video streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). This includes 3D video streams composed of multiple video views, or of a combination of views and depth maps. Several 3D video formats are supported, including simulcast, video-plus-depth, and frame-packing.</t>
<t>A new decoding dependency, "3dd", is defined, describing the association between media stream belonging to a 3D video stream. In addition, a new SDP media-level attribute, "3dvFormat", is defined, describing the format used by media streams within a 3D video stream.
</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	<t>3D video applications convey depth information by showing a different view for each eye of a user. In order to achieve this, 3D video streams need to include additional information compared to conventional 2D video streams, either in the form of extra views, or auxiliary maps such as depth maps , or a combination thereof. These views and maps can be transported in a variety of ways, including, among others: as separate RTP streams (simulcast), frame-packed in a single video stream <xref target="HDMIv1.4a"/>, or using the video-plus-depth format <xref target="ISO/IEC 23002-3"/>.</t>
<t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566"/> lacks the means to describe neither of these transport techniques for 3D video. This document extends SDP to support the description of multimedia sessions using 3D video encapsulated as simulcast streams, using frame-packing techniques, or using the video-plus-depth format.</t>  
<t><xref target="RFC5583"/> defines a mechanism to signal the decoding dependency of media descriptions in SDP. This document extends that mechanism by defining a new SDP decoding dependency type, '3dd', describing the association between media streams belonging to a 3D video stream. In addition, a new SDP media-level attribute, '3dvFormat', is defined to describe the format used by media streams composing a  3D video stream. Several formats for 3D video are described in this specification, including simulcast stereo video, simulcast video and depth map, various frame-packing schemes, and streams using video-plus-depth.</t>

	<section anchor='3dd' title='Decoding dependency of 3D video streams'>
	
	<t>The "depend" SDP attribute, defined in <xref target="RFC5583"/> describes the decoding dependency between two or more media descriptions.  This specification defines a new dependency type for the "depend" attribute:</t>
<t>	<list style='symbols'>
	<t>3dd: 3D video dependency - indicates that the described media stream belongs to a 3D video stream, and requires other media streams to render the 3D video. When "3dd" is used, all required media streams for the Operation Point MUST be identified by identification-tag and fmt-dependency following the "3dd" string.</t></list></t>
<t>Like other dependency types, 3dd is used in combination with the "DDP" grouping semantic, which is defined in <xref target="RFC5583"/>, and based on the SDP grouping framework <xref target="RFC5888"/>. Whenever a 3D video stream is composed of multiple media descriptions, these media descriptions MUST be included in the same DDP group. </t>
<t>The media decoding dependency terminology defined in <xref target="RFC5583"/> can be applied to 3D video streams as follows:</t>
<t><list style='symbols'>
	<t>Media Bitstream: A 3D video stream is considered a Media Bitstream for the purposes of 3dd decoding dependency.</t>
	<t>Media Partition: Each separate media description composing a 3D video stream is considered a Media Partition. Note that each Media Partition usually contains a single video view or depth map, but can also include multiple of views/maps, e.g. when using frame-packing techniques.</t>
	<t>Operation Point: A subset of a 3D Media Bitstream that includes all Media Partitions required for reconstruction at a certain point of quality, number of views or depth maps, or other property. Note that a valid Operation Point for a 3D Media Bitstream can be a 2D video lacking any depth information.</t></list></t>

	<section anchor='3dvFormat' title='The "3dvFormat" media attribute'>
	
<t><list style='empty'><t><![CDATA[ a=3dvFormat:<fmt> <attribute>:<value>]]></t></list></t>
<t>This section defines a new media-level attribute for SDP, "3dvFormat", which can be used to describe the transport format of a media stream in a 3D video stream. This attribute can indicate that a media description corresponds to a specific view within a 3D stream, or to a depth map, or to a combination of views or depth maps encapsulated with frame-packing techniques or with the video-plus-depth mechanism.</t> 
<t>A media description can have multiple "3dvFormat" attributes; each attribute is mapped to a media format specified for the media, indicated by &lt;fmt>. Only one "3dvFormat" attribute is allowed per media format.</t>
<t>Each "3dvFormat" attribute indicates a property (known as a "3D format attribute") associated to a media format of its media description. The 3D format attribute consists on an attribute-value pair, with the form "&lt;attribute>:&lt;value>". This specification defines four 3D format attributes: "depth-map-simulcast", "depth-map-metadata", "stereo-view", "and frame-pack".</t> 
<t>New 3D format attributes can be defined, but they MUST be registered with IANA, following the registry described in <xref target="IANA"/>.</t>

		<section title='The "depth-map-simulcast" 3D format attribute'>
		<t><list style='empty'><t><![CDATA[a=3dvFormat:<fmt> depth-map-simulcast:<associated_video>]]></t></list></t>
		
<t>The 3D format attribute "depth-map-simulcast" indicates that a media stream represents a depth map associated with a view within the same 3D video stream. A depth map described by this attribute is transmitted as a separate transport stream from its corresponding view.</t>
<t>&lt;associated-video> is the media stream identification (the "a=mid" attribute, as defined in <xref target="RFC5888"/>) of the video stream associated with this depth map.</t>
<t>A media description with the "depth-map-simulcast" 3D format attribute MUST be included in a DDP group. This group MUST include a video stream representing the view associated with the depth map. Finally, the depth map media description MUST include a "depend" attribute with the "3dd" dependency type, indicating dependency to one or more media formats within that video stream.</t>
<t>Example:</t>
<t><list style='empty'>
	<t>a=group:DDP 1 2</t>
	<t>m=video 1111 RTP/AVP 99</t>
	<t>a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000</t>
	<t>a=mid:1</t>
	<t>m=video 1112 RTP/AVP 99</t>
	<t>a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000</t>
	<t>a=3dvFormat:99 depth-map-simulcast:1</t>
	<t>a=mid:2</t>
	<t>a=depend:99 3dd 1:99 </t>
</list></t>
<t>The example shows two media descriptions forming a 3D video stream, of which the first one (mid:1) represents a video view, and the second one (mid:2) the depth map for that view. The depth map cannot be used without its corresponding view, and this is reflected in the "depend" attribute.</t>

		
		</section>
		<section title='The "depth-map-metadata" 3D format attribute'>
		<t><list style='empty'><t><![CDATA[a=3dvFormat:<fmt> depth-map-metadata:<associated_video>]]></t></list></t>
		
		<t>The 3D format attribute "depth-map-metadata" indicates that a media stream represents a depth map associated with a view within the same 3D video stream. A depth map described by this attribute is transmitted as part of the same transport stream as its corresponding view, in the form of metadata. If the view associated with this depth map is a MPEG-2 or H.264/AVC video stream, the depth map follows the format defined in MPEG-C part 3 <xref target="ISO/IEC 23002-3"/>.</t>
<t>&lt;associated-video> is the media stream identification (the "a=mid" attribute, as defined in <xref target="RFC5888"/>) of the video stream associated with this depth map.</t>
<t>A media description with the "depth-map-simulcast" 3D format attribute MUST be included in a DDP group. This group MUST include a video stream representing the view associated with the depth map. Finally, the depth map media description MUST include a "depend" attribute with the "3dd" dependency type, indicating dependency to that video stream.</t>
<t>It is important to note that, when a media format with a "depth-map-metadata" is used, the transport information for that media stream such as port, connection address or transport protocol MUST be ignored. In this case, the depth map is transmitted as part of the media stream of its associated view, rather than as a separate stream. </t>
<t>Example:</t>
		
	<t><list style='empty'>
	<t>a=group:DDP 1 2</t>
	<t>m=video 1111 RTP/AVP 99</t>
	<t>a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000</t>
	<t>a=mid:1</t>
	<t>m=video 1112 RTP/AVP 99 100</t>
	<t>a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000</t>
	<t>a=3dvFormat:99 depth-map-simulcast:1</t>
	<t>a=rtpmap:100 H264/90000</t>
	<t>a=3dvFormat:100 depth-map-metadata:1</t>
	<t>a=mid:2</t>
	<t>a=depend:99 3dd 1:99; 100 3dd 1:99</t>
	</list></t>
		
		<t>The example shows two media descriptions forming a 3D video stream, of which the first one (mid:1) represents a video view, and the second one (mid:2) the depth map for that view. Two possible configurations for the depth map are offered, one using simulcast (payload type 99), and the other transmitting the depth map as metadata (payload type 100). If the depth map stream is configured as metadata, the port specified in that media description (1112) will be ignored, since the depth map will be transmitted within the video view stream. On the other hand, if the simulcast option is used, the depth map will be transmitted as a separate stream using the specified port and transport, as usual.</t>
		
		</section>
		<section title='The "stereo-view" 3D format attribute'>
		<t><list style='empty'><t><![CDATA[a=3dvFormat:<fmt> stereo-view:<view-type>	]]></t></list></t>
		
		<t>The 3D format attribute "stereo-view" indicates whether a video stream is associated with the left-eye view or the right-eye view of a stereo 3D video stream.</t>
<t>&lt;view-type> indicates which view is associated with the media stream. It can have the value "left", for the left-eye view, or "right", for the right-eye view.</t>
<t>A media description with the "stereo-view" 3D format attribute MUST be included in a DDP group. This group MUST also include another video stream containing the "stereo-view" 3D format attribute with the other stereo view as value. The media description for either of the two stereo views MUST include a "depend" attribute with the "3dd" dependency type, indicating dependency to the stream corresponding to the other view.</t>
<t>Example:</t>

	<t><list style='empty'>
	<t>a=group: DDP 1 2</t>
	<t>m=video 1111 RTP/AVP 99 </t>
	<t>a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000	</t>
	<t>a=3dvFormat:99 stereo-view:left</t>
	<t>a=mid:1</t>
	<t>m=video 1112 RTP/AVP 99 </t>
	<t>a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000</t>
	<t>a=3dvFormat:99 stereo-view:right</t>
	<t>a=mid:2</t>
	<t>a=depend:99 3dd 1:99 </t>

		</list></t>
		
		<t>The example shows two media descriptions forming a stereo 3D video stream, of which the first one (mid:1) represents the left view, and the second one (mid:2) the right view. This Media Bitstream can be configured as a 3D video stream composed of two stereo views, or as a 2D video stream including just the left eye view. </t>
		
		</section>
		
		<section title='The "frame-pack" 3D format attribute'>
		<t><![CDATA[a=3dvFormat:<fmt> frame-pack:<fp-format> ]]></t>
		
		<t>The 3d attribute indicates that frame-packing mechanisms are used in a media stream, for the specified media format.</t>
<t>&lt;fp-format> signals which frame-packing mode is applied. It has three possible values: "side-by-side", "top-bottom", and "frame-seq".  </t>
<t>Of these frame-pack modes, the first two are based on spatial multiplexing, or dividing each video frame in the stream into two sub-frames, and assigning one view to each sub-frame. In "side-by-side" mode, the left sub-frame corresponds to the left eye view, and the right sub-frame to the right eye view. In "top-bottom" mode, the top sub-frame corresponds to the left eye view, and the lower sub-frame to the right eye view.</t>
<t>On the "frame-seq" (frame sequential) frame-packing mode, time multiplexing is used, so that half the video frames in a stream correspond to the left eye view, and the other half to the right eye view, in alternating order. In order to identify which frame corresponds to each view, additional signalling is required; in H.264/AVC video streams, this is achieved through supplemental enhancement information (SEI) metadata <xref target="ITU-T H.264"/>.</t>

	</section>
	
	<section anchor='offans' title='Usage with SDP offer/answer model'>
	
	<t>When the extensions defined in this specification are used in the SDP offer/answer model <xref target="RFC3264"/>, the following rules apply.</t>
<t>The offerer MAY include more than one "3dvFormat" attribute per media description,  and the values of these "3dvFormat" can be different or duplicated. However, each media format MUST NOT have more than one "3dvFormat" attribute.</t> 
<t>If the offerer includes a 3D video stream composed of more than one media description, all media descriptions in the stream MUST be included in a DDP group. If the 3D video stream includes streams with 3D format attributes whose description specifies any stream requirements or mandatory dependencies, those requirements or dependencies MUST be respected. Each 3D video stream in the offer SHOULD have at least one Operation Point consisting on a single 2D video stream, as well as any number of Operation Points with 3D video.</t>
<t>An answer MUST NOT include any "3dvFormat" attribute that is not present in the offer.</t>
<t>When a media format in an offered media description has a "3dvFormat" attribute, if the answer contains that media format it MUST also include the "3dvFormat" attribute, with the same parameters as the offer.</t>
<t>To simplify the processing of 3D video configurations, when the answer includes a "3dvFormat" attribute in a media description, the same RTP payload type number used in the offer should also be used in the answer, and the answer MUST NOT include more than one media format for that media description.</t>
<t>If the answerer understands the DDP semantics, it is necessary to take the "depend" attribute into consideration in the Offer/Answer procedure, as indicated in <xref target="RFC5583"/></t>
		<section title='Backward compatibility'>
		<t>Depending on implementation, a node that does not understand DDP grouping or "3d" attributes SHOULD respond to an offer using this grouping or attributes either with a refusal to the request, or with an answer that ignores the grouping or 3D video format attributes.</t>
<t>In case of a refused request, if the offerer has identified that the refusal of the request is caused by the use of 3D video, and it still wishes to initiate a session, it SHOULD generate a new offer without any 3D video streams. </t>
<t>If the request is accepted but the answer is ignoring the grouping attribute, the "depend" attribute, or a "3dvFormat", it should be assumed that the answerer is unable to send or receive 3D video streams. If the offerer still wishes to initiate a session, it SHOULD generate a new offer without any 3D video streams. Alternatively, if the answer does not include more than a single video stream, the offerer MAY initiate the session without generating a new offer, and send and receive that stream as a 2D video stream.</t>

	<t>The following examples show SDP Offer/Answer exchanges for sessions with 3D video streams. Only the media descriptions and grouping attributes of the SDP are shown. For each example, two possible answers are considered: one in which the answering device is compatible with this specification, and one with a legacy answering device.	</t>

In the example above, the answering device has selected a media format for the first video stream, and disabled the second video stream.  In this case, the offerer can initiate the session treating the selected media format as a 2D video stream. If the second video stream had not been disabled, the offerer should send a new offer with a single video stream.</t>

    <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                      v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).

v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
                      year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the 
                      IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.  -->
