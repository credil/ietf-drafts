                 draft-agl-tls-encryptedclientcerts-00

1.  Introduction

   TLS [RFC5246] defines a handshake in which both the server's and
   client's certificates (if any) are sent in the clear during the
   initial handshake.  Although the server's certificates are usually
   non-sensitive, client certificates may include email address or even
   full legal names.  Even client certificates that contain nothing but
   a serial number provide a unique identifier that can be correlated
   across connections by an eavesdropper.

   This motivates encrypting the client's certificates.  One existing
   solution is to perform an initial handshake without client
   authentication and then to renegotiate with it.  This solves the
   disclosure issue but at a significant cost in handshake overhead and
   latency.  The solution presented below simply moves the client's
   certificates after the client's ChangeCipherSpec.  This is
   fundamentally incompatable with DH or ECDH certificates but we note
   that such certificates are rarely used in our experience.  This
   solution is also weak as it only defends against eavesdroppers, not
   active attackers.  We still consider it worthwhile given the very low
   cost.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Encrypted client certificates extension

   A new extension type ("encrypted_client_certificates(provisionally
   13180)") is defined and MAY be included by the client in its
   "ClientHello" message.  If, and only if, the server sees this
   extension in the "ClientHello", it MAY choose to include the
   extension in its "ServerHello".  The "extension_data" MUST be empty
   in each case.

   enum {
     encrypted_client_certificates(provisionally 13180), (65535)
   } ExtensionType;

   If the extension is echoed by the server then encrypted client
   certificates are in effect for the handshake.  This causes the
   client's second flow to be reordered so that the "Certificate" and
   "CertificateVerify" messages occur after the "ChangeCipherSpec".

   Here is an example of the client's second flow without encrypted
   client certificates (taken from RFC 5246 [RFC5246]):

   Certificate*
   ClientKeyExchange
   CertificateVerify*
   [ChangeCipherSpec]
   Finished

   When client encrypted certificates are in effect, this becomes:

   ClientKeyExchange
   [ChangeCipherSpec]
   Certificate*
   CertificateVerify*
   Finished

   The "handshake_messages" value of the "CertificateVerify" is
   constructed using the new message order.

   This extension does not imply that a "CertificateRequest" handshake
   message will be sent by the server, nor that a "Certificate" or
   "CertificateVerify" message will be sent by the client.  It only
   affects the message ordering when a client certificate would have
   normally been sent in the clear.

4.  Security considerations

   In the course of a normal handshake, the use of this extension will
   protect the client certificate from eavesdroppers.  An active
   attacker can perform a downgrade attack and expose the client's
   certificates at the cost of dooming the connection.  In order to
   defend against the active attack, a strict client may refuse to send
   certificates is the server doesn't support this extension in the
   initial handshake.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA to update its registry of TLS extensions
   to assign an entry, referred herein as
   "encrypted_client_certificates".
