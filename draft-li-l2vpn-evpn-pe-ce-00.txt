1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] describes protocols and procedures for BGP MPLS
   based Ethernet VPNs.  BGP is used for MAC learning by exchanging
   customer MAC routing information between PEs in the control plane
   instead of MAC learning between PEs in the data plane.  It also
   states that mac learning between PEs and CEs MAY be done in the
   control plane, but it does not define the detailed protocols and
   procedures.  This document specifies protocols and procedures of
   using BGP as PE-CE control protocol for carrying customer MAC routing
   information.  This can provide some benefits such as fast convergence
   in some situation..

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology described in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn].

3.  Application Scenarios

   There are some benefits when control plane is introduced between PE
   and CE in EVPN network.  The following illustrates the benifits with
   an example of fast convergence in the event of PE to CE network
   failure.

   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] defines a mechanism to efficiently and quickly
   signal, to remote PE nodes, the need to update their forwarding
   tables upon the occurrence of a failure in connectivity to an
   Ethernet segment.  This mechanism optimizes the withdrawal of MAC
   advertisement routes, and then optimizes the network convergence time
   in the event of PE to CE failures.  But it still can not fully

   provide convergence time that is independent of the number of MAC
   addresses learned by the PE.  There exist a situation where the
   network convergence time is dependent on the local MAC learning of PE
   and the advertisement of them to remote PE.

   To illustrate this with an example, consider two PEs (PE1 and PE2)
   connected to a multi-homed Ethernet Segment ES1.  All-Active
   redundancy mode is assumed.  A given MAC address M1 is learned by PE1
   but not PE2.  On PE3, the following states may arise:

   T1- When the MAC Advertisement Route from PE1 and the Ethernet A-D
   routes per ESI from PE1 and PE2 are received, PE3 can forward traffic
   destined to M1 to both PE1 and PE2.

   T2- After T1, when the ES1 connected to PE1 fails, PE1 MUST withdraw
   its Ethernet A-D route per ESI, then PE3 forwards traffic destined to
   M1 to PE2 only.

   T3- After T2, PE1 MUST also withdraw the MAC advertisement routes
   (M1) that are impacted by the failure.  Before PE2 learns M1 and
   advertises a MAC route for M1, PE3 will treat traffic to M1 as
   unknown unicast.  If the behavior is to drop the unknown unicast
   based on administrative policy, the traffic to M1 on PE3 will be
   interrupted.  Note that had PE2 also advertised a MAC route for M1
   before PE1 withdraws its MAC route, then PE3 would have continued
   forwarding traffic destined to M1.

   In the above example, once the local MAC learning of PE was done via
   control plane, both PE1 and PE2 advertise a MAC route for M1, then
   PE3 could continue forwarding traffic destined to M1 in the event of
   ES1 connected to PE1 or PE2 fails.  In this case, the network
   convergence time is not dependent of the local MAC learning and
   advertisement of MAC addresses learned by the PE any more.  The
   benefit can be achieved in case of single-active redundancy mode.

4.  BGP E-VPN NLRI Extensions

   A new route type is defined for EVPN NLRI to advertise customer MAC
   route between PE and CE in EVP:

      + 6 - Customer MAC advertisement route

   A customer MAC advertisement route type specific EVPN NLRI consists
   of the following:

   It should be noted that the Route Distinguisher (RD) is not used
   since the customer MAC routes are always exchanged in the context of
   unawareness of Ethernet VPN.

5.  Exchanging C-MAC Routes

   This section describes the procedures of exchanging customer MAC
   routes between PE and CE.  This document assumes that a CE and a PE
   exchange MAC routes over a direct BGP session, and also BGP is just
   only used to carrying MAC information from CE to PE in current
   version.  Usage of carrying MAC information from PE to CE using BGP
   will be described in future version.

5.1.  Originating MAC Route at the CE router

   When a CE receives packets in a given VLAN from interfaces, other
   than interfaces connected to the PE, it learns MAC addresses in the
   data plane.  If the given VLAN is in the setting of VLANs across the
   Ethernet links attached to a given PE, the CE MAY advertises the MAC
   addresses it learns in the data plane to the given PE, using MP-BGP
   and the specified MAC Route, in the control plane.  The MAC route is
   constructed as follows:

    + The field of the Ethernet Segment Identifier is reserved for
      future use.

    + The Ethernet Tag ID is set the VLAN ID from which the MAC
      addresses is learned.

Internet-Draft      Using BGP between PE & CE in EVPN       October 2013


    + The MAC address length field is in bits and it is typically set to
      48.  However this specification enables specifying the MAC address
      as a prefix; in which case, the MAC address length field is set to
      the length of the prefix.  This provides the ability to aggregate
      MAC addresses if the deployment environment supports that.

    + The MAC address is set to the value of MAC address the CE learned.
      The encoding of a MAC address MUST be the 6-octet MAC address
      specified by [802.1D-ORIG] [802.1D-REV].  If the MAC address is
      advertised as a prefix then the trailing bits of the prefix MUST
      be set to 0 to ensure that the entire prefix is encoded as 6
      octets.

    + The IP Address field is optional.  By default, the IP Address
      Length field is set to 0 and the IP address field is omitted from
      the route.  When a valid IP address or address prefix needs to be
      advertised (e.g., for ARP suppression purposes or for inter-subnet
      switching), it is then encoded in this route.  In this case, the
      IP Address Length field is in bits and it is the length of the IP
      prefix.  This provides the ability to advertise IP address
      prefixes when the deployment environment supports that.

    + The encoding of an IP address MUST be either 4 octets for IPv4 or
      16 octets for IPv6.  When the IP address is advertised as a
      prefix, then the trailing bits of the prefix MUST be set to 0 to
      ensure that the entire prefix is encoded as either 4 or 16 octets.
      The length field of Ethernet NLRI is sufficient to determine
      whether an IP address/prefix is encoded in this route and if so,
      whether the encoded IP address/prefix is IPV4 or IPv6.

    + The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route
      MUST be set to the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the advertising CE.

   It should be noted that the BGP advertisement for the MAC route does
   not need to carry the Route Target (RT) attributes because of its
   unawareness of Ethernet VPN.

5.2.  Receiving a MAC Route by the PE router

   When a PE receives a MAC route from a CE, it learns the MAC addresses
   advertised in the MAC route in the control plane and associates the
   MAC addresses with the Ethernet Segment from which it can reach to
   the advertising CE and the VLAN carried in the MAC route.

   The PE SHOULD install forwarding state for the associated MAC
   addresses based on the Ethernet Segment and VLAN inferred from the
   MAC route.

Internet-Draft      Using BGP between PE & CE in EVPN       October 2013


   In addition, the PE SHOULD advertises the MAC addresses it learns
   from CE in the control plane, to all the other PEs in the associated
   EVPN instance, using MP-BGP and the MAC Advertisement route defined
   in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn].  For example, the PE learns a MAC address
   M1 on a multi-homed Ethernet Segment (ES1) and on a VLAN 10, and the
   VLAN 10 is bundled to EVPN A. The PE SHOULD advertise the MAC address
   M1 to all the other PEs in EVPN A.

   The construction of the MAC Advertisement route and procedures of
   handling the MAC Advertisement route on receiving it are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA to assign a new route type value for
   E-VPN NLRI.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security aspects beyond those of E-VPN
   ([I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn]).
