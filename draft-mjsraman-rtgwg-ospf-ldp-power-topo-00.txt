      Power Based Topologies in OSPF using LDP for label exchanges
              draft-mjsraman-rtgwg-ospf-ldp-power-topo-00


Abstract

   In this specification OSPF shortest path first computation is done
   based on power ratios (consumed-power to available-bandwidth OR
   available-bandwidth to available-bandwidth) assigned to links and
   nodes such as Broadcast-Multi-Access networks that form part of the
   topology in an area. When MPLS is deployed in the area (be it the
   backbone or non-backbone area) LDP can be used to distribute a
   disjoint set of labels for the power based topology. Flows some or
   all of those that traverse the area can then be mapped either to the
   regular shortest-path tree or the power based shortest-path tree.
   This document specifies the proposal to construct and maintain such a
   tree called the power based SPT.

1. Introduction

   Estimates of power consumption for the Internet predict a 300%
   increase, as access speeds increase from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps [3],
   [8]. Access speeds are likely to increase as new video, voice and
   gaming devices get added to the Internet. Various approaches have
   been proposed to reduce the power consumption of the Internet such as
   designing low-power routers and switches, and optimizing the network
   topology using traffic engineering methods [2].

   Typically both Campus networks and Service Provider networks face
   power saving challenges. It is even exacerbated in modern data
   centers. In this document we propose a scheme that will apply to all
   of these areas of interest.

   In a Interior Gateway Protocol like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
   the routes for networks and their specific next-hops are built from a
   tree with the router that is involved in the calculation being the
   root of the tree. Initially link-state database items are exchanged
   prior to this Shortest Path First computation. Once the database
   exchanges are complete then the weights assigned to links and
   Broadcast Multi-Access (BMA) nodes are used to find the shortest path
   from the said router to each destination advertised in the network
   (through these database exchanges). It is proposed in this document
   that the weights assigned to links and BMA nodes be determined by a
   ratio of consumed-power-to-available-bandwidth or available-power to-
   available bandwidth and be advertised along with the regular link and
   BMA node metrics. Thus an alter-ego of the regular topology with
   weights determined by the ratios mentioned are maintained. Once these
   are maintained in each router for its area the shortest path
   computation is done based on this power ratio based topology.

   When LDP is used to distribute MPLS labels by a router in an area,
   the router besides distributing its regular topology labels also
   distributes labels for the power-shortest path tree computed using
   the power ratios as link weights. This topology could be used to
   assign some or all of the flows (if all then the power based
   shortest-path tree becomes the default tree) passing through the area
   to the routers which are more power efficient. Power profiles of
   various routers is also discussed in this context in this document.



1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The proposal we make in this document indicates ways to solve the
   power reduction problem, by calculating a POWER metric whose
   importance is highlighted in the below mentioned sections. This POWER
   metric is obtained by including the factors such as power consumed by
   a linecard on a single chassis or multi-chassis router and
   consequently a port on that linecard by proportionally calculating
   power consumed for that port and hence for the link. The other factor
   that is taken into account is the Available Bandwidth on that port
   and hence on that link.



2. Methodology

   For each router / switch there exist linecards and each linecard has
   a set of ports or sometimes just one port of high capacity. This
   usually applies on routers and switches that are either single
   chassis or multi-chassis in their characterisation. By single chassis
   we mean that there exists a single chassis and slots for the Route
   Processor Card (one or more of these) typically upto to two of them,
   and one or more slots for linecards each having their respective
   characteristics such as number of ports (port density), type of such
   ports (SONET, ethernet, ATM etc..) usually depending on the link
   layer technology they support. Links are connections between ports on
   these linecards to other ports on linecards of other single chassis
   or multi-chassis system. A multi-chassis system is one that has
   multiple such chassis interconnceted amongst each other to form a
   single logical view of the system. Both single and multi-chassis have
   linecards and respective ports on these linecards. Multi-chassis
   typically have a switch fabric chassis which connects each of these
   chassis to each other or to chassis of other multi-chassis or single
   chassis systems.

   In the above topology assume all point-to-point links between the
   routers. For now we will deal with P2P links alone and not venture
   into Broadcast Multi-access links or Non-Broadcast Multi-access links
   etc.. It is suffice to show how the scheme works for P2P links and
   then move more specifically to other types of networks to demonstrate
   this method of calculating the power topology of the network in the
   figure.

   Each linecard consumes a certain amount of power and it is vendor
   dependent as to how the power consumed relates to the Available
   Bandwidth on any of the links to which the linecard connects to. It
   is possible that the said topology of routers come from one vendor or
   from multiple vendors. It is assumed that the algorithm proposed will
   have the power consumed by a linecard available as a readable value
   in terms of W or kW or whichever measurable metric that is provided
   by the vendor. 

   It is possible that some of the Linecards are more capable than the
   others. Consider that Router A is a more capable router with more
   powerful linecards with higher port density. This is not shown in the
   figure, but assume so. LC1, LC2 on Router A could be consuming more
   power than the other Linecards on other routers. The main reason
   could be that LC1 and LC2 may have higher port density or higher

   speed ports than the other routers. In order to calculate the power
   consumed on a link by a linecard it is important that we normalize
   the power as power consumed per port. Here the ports are normalized
   to lowest common denominator. If all links in the topology have 10G
   port capacity then the power calculated should be in terms power
   consumed per 10G port.

   Assuming we have done this normalization we go on to calculate the
   POWER metric for each of the ports involved in a link which is
   derived as follows...

   POWER metric    = Power consumed per XG (normalized bandwidth) port
   for a given       -------------------------------------------------
   Port on a LC              Available Bandwidth on that port

   Assume link L1. The ports concerned are both 10G and the ports are P5
   on Router A and P4 on Router D. For calculating the POWER metric for
   a link which we will call PWRLINK we calculate the POWER metric for
   each side of the link and average the two to get PWRLINK.

   So PWRLINK for L1 =  POWER for P5 on LC1  +  Power for P4 on LC1
                         on Router A               on Router D
                        ============================================
                                            2

   The above can also be weighted if there is a multi-capacity port on
   one side of the link and not on the other. A multi-capacity link is
   one which provides multiple bandwidth capabilities such (1G/10G/100G)
   for example but auto-negotiates with other end to provide a lesser
   than highest capacity service.

   The PWRLINK metrices once calculated are flooded in already defined
   OSPF-TE-LSA as an adapted TE-metric and is typically flooded as a
   link characteristic. 

   It is important to note that the denominator for POWER metric is
   Available Bandwidth on that port. The Available Bandwidth is measured
   in terms of intervals and not as discrete quantities. This is in
   order not to flood PWRLINK metrics into the OSPF area in LSAs very
   frequently as Bandwidth may constantly change. The same applies to
   POWER metric as well. 

   Once the LSAs have been flooded the Routers run regular SPF on the
   graph of the topology with PWRLINKs assigned to the links and
   calculate the PWRLINK based paths which consume the least power. The
   shortest power paths based on this topology can be used for
   forwarding high bandwidth streams and to optimally use power within
   the area.

   The Available Bandwidth column shows the Available bandwidth of the
   link corresponding to the row and column intersection. This figure is
   used as the numerator in the POWER metric computation for that port.

2.0.1 Experimental results and their inferences 

   The first experiments were carried out with Available Utilization
   since only 10G and 100G ports were considered. This baselines the
   metric to 10G ports and proportionality thereof. But in reality the
   actual Available Bandwidth needs to be considered for real world
   experiments. Hence this draft has been adapted to reflect the
   Available Bandwidth to be taken as the denominator of the formula
   thereof.

   Dividing the Power consumed or Available Power by the Available
   Bandwidth gives a better picture of how much power cost per Gb is
   consumed and normalizes the metric amongst links of varying
   bandwidth.

   Please refer to the section on Power Profiles where the different
   decisions in the SPF computation are described. 

2.1 Power Bias

   Assume in the figure that there exist Routers A and D and that there
   is a bias on the link L1 in such a way that Router D computes a POWER
   metric of 10 and the Router D computes a POWER metric of 2 on the
   ports P5 and P4 respectively. Now the PWRLINK would be 6 for that
   link L1. Thus even if one side is excessively power guzzling then the
   PWRLINK moves up and thus is less preferred in the CSPF algorithm and
   path computation based on the Power topology. 

   If there is no bias and both the sides of the link are optimal in
   their power usage then the metric stays low even if more streams are
   sent on it. This is the main objective that is set out for router and
   switch manufacturers in the single chassis and multi-chassis world,
   in that they are incentivised to manufacture linecards that are not
   power hungry even if the number of packets flowing through them is
   high and thus the Bandwidth Available is also reasonably on the
   higher side compared to other routers. 

   For those manufacturers who set a high power value for even minimal
   traffic, the vendors that dont would win out in the end. 

2.1.1 Advertising Available POWER 

   Please see section 2.4.1 for more information on why Available POWER
   plays a crucial role in determining the choice of routers based on

   the Power metric.  

2.2 ECMP links

   It is possible that multiple links would have the same PWRLINK metric
   after a computation cycle. In such a case load-balancing techniques
   can be used to keep the ECMP links in a steady state with respect to
   each other. Depending on the Available Bandwidth thereafter it is
   possible that the ECMP links may no longer be Equal cost but UCMP or
   Unequal Cost Paths.

2.3 Dampening the side effects of constant change

   It is recommended in this draft that the implementation of the
   proposal be adaptive, infrequent in computation to the extent
   possible without sacrificing adapting to the dynamism and also reduce
   any frequent oscillations. It SHOULD be specified that intervals of
   Available bandwidth and Consumed-Power or Available-Power be used
   instead of discrete values in arriving at the power ratios. This will
   dampen any frequent SPF computation for the power based topology.
   Even if intervals are used dampening fluctuations should be in place
   to prevent frequent re-computation of the SPF tree.

2.4 Calculating power shortest paths in an Area


   Assume the following topology where A,B,C etc.. are routers and
   corresponding labelled edges with weights are the links. These
   weights are the current values of the PWRLINK attribute that has been
   flooded in the LSAs through the Area concerned. Assume B is the ABR
   for Area 1 and the routers A and C are the Area 0 core routers. The
   rest of the routers are assumed to be in Area 1. Once the power
   topology of the Area 1 has been calculated as shown below with the
   PWRLINK attributes being assigned to the links, Power based shortest
   path first (SPF) computation can be run on the routers say. The SPF
   algorithm does its computation for the power topology which is
   characterized in terms of the PWRLINK attributes along with other
   attributes to construct a power shortest path tree from the router
   performing the computation to all the destinations in the area.
   Calculations for the power based topology are done on ABRs, ASBRs and
   area core routers.

2.4.1 Power profiles of Routers and Switches and SPF computation

   It has been experimented and from several sources found that there
   exist routers which have different power profiles. The power profile
   of a router is the curve of power consumption to available bandwidth.
   Mentioned below are a few of these prominent ones that have to be
   taken into consideration. The power based SPF computation follows the
   procedures specified below when confronted with two or more routers
   that have reachability to destinations in its calculation for the
   power based shortest path tree.

   The first profile that we will consider is the flattening curve. The
   power consumed to available bandwidth curve takes the shape of a
   steep one initially and then tapers off to a plateau. The point at
   which it begins to give a delta-C (delta in Power Consumed) to delta-
   B (Available Bandwidth exhausted) is the inflection point that tapers
   off to a plateau. Here the delta-C/delta-B begins to slow down or
   decrease rapidly. The more the traffic that is added onto the device
   the lesser it draws power.

   The second profile that we will consider is the exponential curve.
   The power consumed to available bandwidth curve takes the shape of an
   ever increasing steep curve as shown below. Here the delta-C/delta-B
   begins to increase as more traffic is thrown onto it as the Available
   bandwidth exhausted increases. This power curve beyond a point is
   intolerable with respect to power guzzling.

   2.4.1.1 Concave and Convex power curves

   Given that there are 3 kinds of major profiles in the router power
   consumption, what line would we like to pick. This is an important
   point when choosing the metric to pick the low power paths. 

   (a) If the confrontation is between 2 first profile routers the lower
   of the 2 would be considered as shown below. The lower curve offers
   better power savings for each GB of bandwidth transported.

   (b) If the confrontation is between 2 second profile routers the
   upper curve offers more power savings per GB of bandwidth.

      P |                          .  .
      o |                         .  .

      s |        .
      u.|  .
      ------------------------------------>
        |    Available Bandwidth exhausted

   (c) When the confrontation is between a first profile curve and a
   second profile curve, it would be optimal to pick (as shown below)
   the lower of the curves because it gives us lesser power consumed for
   every GB of traffic routed / switched. Here the exponential curve is
   the one that offers lesser amount of power consumed per GB of traffic
   is chosen. But when it gets to a point that the two curves intersect
   it would be more optimal to pick the tapering curve. Thus at the
   meeting point of the 2 curves the exponential curve becomes more
   costly and the tapering one gives us more GB for the power buck. Thus
   this switchover from one curve to the other (in other words from the
   exponential curve to the tapering one) does the trick in terms of
   finding an optimal solution.

      (*) Metric switchover point from Consumed Power to Available

2.4.1.3 Need to advertise both available power and consumed power

   Thus the above sections have shown that both the available power and
   the consumed power MUST be advertised so that case (c) can be
   deciphered and the switchover of the curves be done and the
   appropriate router be chosen for the rest of the bandwidth to be
   switched over to.

   Thus there will exist Consumed-Power to Available Bandwidth ratio and
   the Available Power to Available Bandwidth ratio. Both the ratios are
   computed and the lower value chosen. The Available Power can be
   judged from the calibration process such as the one carried out by
   independent test organizations as in [12]. An example of their
   calibration is referred to in [12].

   Here given below is the formula for calculating the Available Power
   to Available Bandwidth ratio also called the Available POWER metric.

2.4.2 Power to Available Bandwidth ratio in a TLV

   As per [RFC3630] the Link TLV can be used to carry this power to
   available Bandwidth ratio with an additional sub-TLV of the link TLV.
   The sub-type number 11 is recommended to be defined for this purpose.

   [RFC 3630] states in section 2.2.1 and we QUOTE ...

   2.2.1  Link TLV

   The Link TLV describes a single link.  It is constructed of a set of
   sub-TLVs.  There are no ordering requirements for the sub-TLVs.

   Only one Link TLV shall be carried in each LSA, allowing for fine
   granularity changes in topology.

   The Link TLV is type 2, and the length is variable.

   The following sub-TLVs of the Link TLV are defined:

            1 - Link type (1 octet)
            2 - Link ID (4 octets)
            3 - Local interface IP address (4 octets)
            4 - Remote interface IP address (4 octets)
            5 - Traffic engineering metric (4 octets)
            6 - Maximum bandwidth (4 octets)
            7 - Maximum reservable bandwidth (4 octets)
            8 - Unreserved bandwidth (32 octets)
            9 - Administrative group (4 octets)
           10 - Power-to-Multicast-replication-capacity (4 octets)
           11 - Consumed-Power-to-Available-Bandwidth (4 octets)
           12 - Available-Power-to-Available-Bandwidth (4 octets)

   This memo defines sub-Types 1 through 9.  See the IANA Considerations
   in [RFC3630] section for allocation of new sub-Types.

   The Link Type and Link ID sub-TLVs are mandatory, i.e., must appear
   exactly once.  All other sub-TLVs defined here may occur at most
   once.  These restrictions need not apply to future sub-TLVs.
   Unrecognized sub-TLVs are ignored.

   Various values below use the (32 bit) IEEE Floating Point format. For
   quick reference, this format is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |S|    Exponent   |                  Fraction                   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   S is the sign, Exponent is the exponent base 2 in "excess 127"
   notation, and Fraction is the mantissa - 1, with an implied binary
   point in front of it.  Thus, the above represents the value:

      (-1)**(S) * 2**(Exponent-127) * (1 + Fraction)

   It is proposed that we use the Power-to-Available-Bandwidth ratio as
   a 32 bit IEEE floating Point format field for the purpose of this
   document.

2.4.3 LDP Capability Parameter TLV for Power-SPF based label exchanges

   As per [5561] a capability parameter TLV can be exchanged at the
   initialization time or when the administrator fo the network turns on
   the feature later on. On turning on this feature, the power based
   shortest-path computation is done and labels exchanged for prefixes
   through regular LDP operation. The set of labels used for this power
   based shortest-path tree is disjoint from the label space used for
   regular IPoMPLS LDP and other features enabled.

2.4.4 When one peer says Power-SPF is fine but the other doesnt

   All the peers should advertise this capability. In other words all of
   the routers in the area should be involved in disseminating power SPT
   based labels. 

2.4.5 Mapping flows to the Power based SPT

   It is possible to map FECs (Forwarding Equivalence classes) some or
   all of them to the power based SPT. This offers flexibility to the
   admin to map certain set of large flows to the least power consuming
   routers in the topology thus getting the best bang for the bit as far
   as power is concerned.

3  Security Considerations

   No additional security considerations are required other than the
   existing mechanisms available for securing LDP exchanges.


4  IANA Considerations

   New requirements are required from IANA for a new type in the Link
   TLV in order to carry the PWRLINK metric as well. This is needed for
   both Consumed Power Ratio and Available Power Ratio.

   A new code-point for the Capability Parameter TLV needs to be
   assigned for indicating that a router supports power based SPT and
   label space thereof.
