Internet-Draft           Call-Info Purpose: IMPP                May 2013


1.  Introduction

   To improve interoperability among real-time communication endpoints
   that support the combined use of the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) [RFC3261] and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   (XMPP) [RFC6120] (so-called "CUSAX" endpoints [I-D.ivov-xmpp-cusax]),
   it can be helpful to communicate the endpoint's SIP address over XMPP
   and the endpoint's XMPP address over SIP to provide hints about the
   endpoints communication capabilities.  The former feature is enabled
   by an XMPP extension protocol called Reachability Addresses
   [XEP-0152].  As to the latter feature, discussion in the SIP
   community led to the conclusion that it would be best to use the
   Call-Info header field [RFC3261] with a value of "impp" ("instant
   messaging and presence protocol") for the "purpose" header field
   parameter.  An example follows.

   Call-Info: <xmpp:juliet@example.com> ;purpose=impp

   Although CUSAX endpoints constitute the primary use case for the
   "impp" purpose, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] for an
   instant messaging and presence protocol other than XMPP could be
   included in the Call-Info header field.


2.  Security Considerations

   Advertising an endpoint's XMPP address over SIP could inform
   malicious entities about an alternative attack vector.  Because the
   "purpose" header field parameter could be spoofed, the receiving
   endpoint ought to check the value against an authoritative source
   such as a user directory.  Clients can integrity protect and encrypt
   this header field using end-to-end mechanisms such as S/MIME or hop-
   by-hop mechanisms such as TLS.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines and registers a new predefined value "impp" for
   the "purpose" header field parameter of the Call-Info header field.
   The IANA can complete this action by adding this RFC as a reference
   to the line for the header field "Call-Info" and parameter name
   "purpose" in the Header Field Parameters and Parameter Values section
   of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters registry:

     Header Field: Call-Info
     Parameter Name: purpose
     Predefined Values: Yes
     Reference: [this document]
