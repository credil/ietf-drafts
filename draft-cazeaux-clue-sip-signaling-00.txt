Internet-Draft         CLUE signaling requirements            March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The framework defined for Telepresence Multi-Streams
   [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] in the context of CLUE introduces the need
   to have CLUE messages, conveying CLUE data, exchanged between
   telepresence endpoints.  It is necessary to agree upon signaling
   protocol enabling these CLUE messages to be exchanged, taking into
   account the existing SIP-SDP ecosystem.

   This document first outlines signaling requirements to be met by the
   CLUE protocol.  Then the document proposes two possible approaches
   for the design of this protocol.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements

   The term of "solution" designates here the set of mechanisms that
   allows endpoints to exchange CLUE related information.

   REQ-1   The solution MUST enable the implementation of the CLUE
           framework described in [I-D.ietf-clue-framework], in
           particular : CLUE data model, provider/consumer exchange.

   REQ-2   The solution MUST allow session establishment between two
           Telepresence endpoints, and between a Telepresence endpoint
           and a Multipoint Control Unit (MCU).  The solution MUST
           support the establishment of symmetrical or asymmetrical
           media streams between the Telepresence endpoints (or MCU).

   REQ-3   The solution MUST enable interoperability with SIP legacy
           endpoints, without requiring intermediary protocol
           translation systems.  At a minimum, the solution MUST enable
           interoperability with legacy SIP audio endpoints (one audio
           media stream) and SIP video endpoints (one audio media
           stream, zero or one main video media stream, zero or one
           presentation video media stream, zero or one BFCP stream).

   REQ-4   The solution MUST enable interoperability with SIP legacy
           endpoints, with a minimum number of offer-answer cycles.

   REQ-5   The solution MUST NOT make any assumptions on the SIP
           implementation level (besides [RFC3261]) of intermediary
           systems that could be in the signaling path of a Telepresence
           session (e.g. a Session Border Controller, SBC).

   REQ-6   The solution MUST enable to discover whether a remote party
           is CLUE-enabled or not.

   REQ-7   The solution MUST rely on the SDP offer/answer model for any
           CLUE data related to the definition of media streams.  This
           requirement in particular aims to enable intermediaries (such
           as SBCs) to apply appropriate policies (e.g.  QoS marking,
           Bandwidth control ...), which require that SDP offers and
           answers provide and accurate description of the actual media
           streams.

   REQ-8   The solution MUST enable to exchange data related to media
           capture (description, spatial relations, etc.) and to select
           media capture without dependency or impact on the negotiated
           media streams (except that a media capture MUST refer to a
           negotiated media stream).

   REQ-9   The solution MUST take into account that a media capture
           selection could result from the interaction with an end-user,
           at any time during a session.  The user interaction can
           indeed occur between the provider capability advertisement
           and the consumer selection, but also at any moment during the
           established session.

   REQ-10  The solution MUST NOT add new requirements regarding NAT
           traversal compared to legacy video systems (NOTE : lesson
           learned from BFCP over TCP).

   REQ-11  The solution MUST be extensible in order to support future
           evolution in a backward compatible manner.


   Note that no requirement is placed regarding to the latency of the
   CLUE messages exchanged between the provider and the consumer.

Internet-Draft         CLUE signaling requirements            March 2012


4.1.  Option A: CLUE signaling based on SIP-SDP signaling

   This option proposes an approach where the exchange of CLUE messages
   between the provider and the consumer is based on the SDP O/A model
   as specified in [RFC3264].  The SDP is used for the exchange of media
   stream and media capture data.

                           |                                    |

   cons-capX includes the capabilities of the consumer X.

   ann-capX includes the capabilities announced by the provider X.

   conf-capX includes the capabilities configured by the consumer X.

   The first SDP offer/answer cycle enables the CLUE exchange between A
   as provider and B as consumer.  The second SDP offer/answer cycle
   enables the CLUE exchange between A as consumer and B as provider.
   This second SDP offer/answer cycle completes the first one, so that

   it can safely replace it.

   It is worth noting that this option will not satisfy the requirements
   following requirements:

   REQ-8:  this option requires a complete SDP offer/answer cycle to
       change media capture selection, thus requires to re-negotiate
       (even if not actually required) the media streams.
   REQ-9:  the transmission of a SDP answer cannot wait for a user
       action more than what a SIP transaction timer allows.

4.1.2.  Transport and encoding choice

   In this option, the CLUE protocol is entirely based on the SDP offer/
   answer model as described in [RFC3264].  Thus the transport protocol
   for CLUE messages is SIP, and the encoding of CLUE messages is SDP.

4.2.  Option B: media capture selection in a separate protocol

   This option proposes an approach where the exchange of CLUE messages
   between the provider and the consumer related to media stream is
   based on the SDP offer/answer model as described in [RFC3264], and
   the exchange of CLUE messages related to media captures is based on a
   dedicated channel (named futher the CLUE channel).

                                 Figure 2

   SDP-offer1:  This SDP provides the capabilities of A acting as a
       consumer (what A can receive) under the form of the number and
       characteristics of media streams that A is able to receive.  This
       SDP also provides the capabilities of A acting as a provider
       (what A can send) which describe the characteristics A's media
       streams .  The characteristics of the media streams that A can
       send include, among other: spatial relations, available media
       captures.  At this stage: A can receive and can send.

   SDP-answer1:  This SDP provides the capabilities of B as consumer.  B
       builds his SDP in response to the capabilities of A, meaning that
       B will here define what it will receive according to A's
       capabilities as provider.  This SDP also provides the
       capabilities of B as provider, here also in response to the
       capabilities of A, meaning that B will define what it will send
       to A. At this stage : B will receive and send, A will receive and
       send.
       After this SDP offer/answer cycle, A and B are able to send and
       receive media through the media streams that have been
       negotiated.  Additionally, each entity (as consumer) know what
       media captures can be sent by the remote provider.  However, no

Internet-Draft         CLUE signaling requirements            March 2012


       media capture selection has been yet performed.

   CLUE channel:  The CLUE channel enables each consumer to perform
       media content selection according to provider capabilities.  It
       is worth noting that any operation performed on this channel is
       done in the context of the previous SDP offer-answer.  The use of
       this channel is optional.  Without it, a consumer cannot perform
       selection, thus the provider will adopt a default behavior in
       terms of media content.

   SDP-offer2 and SDP-answer2:  Subsequent SDP offer/answer cycles may
       occur, when A or B wishes to update his capabilities (add or
       remove a media stream for instance).

   This option should satisfy all requirements.

4.2.2.  Transport and encoding choice

   In this option, the solution is constituted of at least two protocol
   elements.

   The first protocol element aims to handle the CLUE media streams and
   the advertisement of the CLUE media captures.  For this part, the
   transport protocol of CLUE messages is SIP, and the encoding is SDP.

   The second protocol element (named hereafter the CLUE channel), aims
   to handle the CLUE media capture configuration and selection.  The
   CLUE channel most likely relies on a separate protocol.

   A possible design of the CLUE channel is to rely on the BFCP protocol
   ([RFC4582]) extended as defined in
   [I-D.westerlund-dispatch-stream-selection].

4.3.  Interoperability with legacy endpoints

   To enable the interoperability with legacy endpoints, a CLUE-enabled
   endpoint must be able to discover whether the remote endpoint is
   CLUE-enabled or not.  When the remote endpoint is not CLUE-enabled,
   the telepresence endpoints must establish a session without using
   CLUE extensions.

   Two solutions are possible:

   Solution 1:  OPTIONS procedures are invoked before the first offer/
       answer cycle between a consumer and a provider.  The OPTIONS
       procedure enables the provider to retrieve consumer capabilities
       so as to be able to build an SDP Offer that is meaningful for the
       consumer.  This procedure is particularly useful to enable the



Cazeaux & Bertin        Expires September 6, 2012               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         CLUE signaling requirements            March 2012


       provider to determine whether the consumer is CLUE-enabled or
       not.

   Solution 2:  RFC5939 ([RFC5939]) is used.  The SDP Offer sent by the
       provider includes an "Actual Configuration" and one or more
       "Potential Configurations".  The "Actual Configuration"
       corresponds to a basic mono-stream video call and can be
       understood by any endpoint.  One of the "Potential
       Configurations" corresponds to a fully CLUE-compliant endpoint.
       Other "Potential Configurations" may correspond to partially
       compliant endpoint (e.g. multistream video without clue-specific
       data).

   The option A as defined in Section 4.1 relies on the solution 1, and
   the option B as defined Section 4.2 relies the solution 2.  However
   it is worth noting that the the design of the solution to enable
   interoperability with legacy is actually independent from the choice
   of introducing a CLUE channel or not.  In other terms, the option A
   could also rely on the solution 2, and the option B on the solution
   1.
