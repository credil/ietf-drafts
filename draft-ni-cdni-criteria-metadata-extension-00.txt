Abstract


   In CDNI deployment, the downstream  CDN may probably delivers
   content to mobile devices, which is served by cellular networks
   (e.g., 2G, 3G). The purpose of this document is to provide some
   complement to the delivery criteria in current Metadata Interface
   with a more precise criteria model, which is in consideration of
   content delivery service to mobile devices.

Internet-Draft       Criteria Metadata Extension             July 2012



1. Introduction


   In some CDNI deployment, the downstream CDN may probably deliver
   content to mobile devices, which serves by 2G/3G cellular networks.
   In some cases, the User Agent is connected to CDN's surrogate via an
   intermediate gateway (eg., WAP Gateway and Internet Gateway).

   The metadata interface is defined by several CDNI documents, such as
   [draft-caulfield-cdni-metadata-core-00], [draft-liu-cdni-metadata-
   interface-01], and [draft-jenkins-cdni-metadata-00]. For the reason
   of copyright protection, CSPs often need to restrict content access
   to users in certain regions (e.g., within a given country or through
   a given access network). The delivery criteria metadata provides a
   list of valid source IP subnets from which content requests may be
   accepted. However, few considerations have been made for mobile
   network. This document focuses on the delivery criteria in the
   metadata interface. It enables a downstream CDN to obtain more
   information about cellular network, so that the downstream CDN can
   properly process and respond to content request from mobile devices.

1.1. Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology defined in [I-D.draft-cdni-
   problem-statement] and [draft-fmn-cdni-advanced-use-cases-00].

1.2. Abbreviations

   o UE: User Equipment
   o MSISDN: Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number
   o APN: Access Point Name
   o WAP: Wireless Application Protocol
   o HLR: Home Location Register

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Internet Gateway in Mobile Network

   In cellular network, some mobile devices are not powerful enough to
   render and process web pages built for desktop browsers. So WAP
   Gateway (or Internet Gateway) is extensively deployed as a bridge to
   ensure the connection and conversion of information between mobile
   devices and content server. For example, WAP Gateway unpacks all the
   layers in the stack, translates requests from a wireless protocol to
   Internet protocols, and compresses the original content into a
   compact format in order to save bandwidth over the air and reduce
   the processing requirements for mobile device. With the advent of
   fast processors, large memory and the deployment of 3G and 4G
   networks, many mobile devices can directly process web pages and
   content without WAP Gateway.

   However, APN identifies the form of access, in most cases one APN
   setting (i.e. "cmwap" for China Mobile, and "uniwap" for China
   Unicom) is used for both Internet and WAP access. Users may access
   different information sources with a single APN. In this condition,
   all the requests from the mobile devices will be sent to the WAP
   Gateway.

   Figure 1 shows a typical end-to-end WAP system in mobile networks.
   WAP Gateway locates between the mobile network service provider's
   core network and the content server.

   Figure 1  Typical architecture of WAP system in mobile network

   In addition to the protocol translation and content compression, WAP
   Gateway can be configured to provide additional information through
   HTTP headers, for instance the IP address of UE, user's MSISDN, type
   of mobile network, and even cell ID.

   The following is an example of HTTP request sent from WAP Gateway to
   content server. The x-forwarded-for header field specifies the UE's
   IP address assigned by the mobile core network. The x-up-calling-
   line-id header field specifies user's MSISDN.

       GET /articles/news/default.aspx HTTP/1.1

4. CDNI with Mobile Access Scenario

   In many cases, CDN may deliver content to mobile devices as well as
   PC. In CDNI deployment, mobile devices can also access the content
   of CSP via mobile networks and dCDN/uCDN, as depicted in Figure 2.

   Figure 2 Content access via mobile networks in CDNI deployment


   Scenario 1:

   During packet switch attachment, mobile device is assigned an IP
   address by the entities of core network (i.e. GGSN or PDSN). For
   different configurations of APN, the IP address could be either
   public or private. As mentioned before, WAP Gateway is the
   aggregation point of all requests from mobile devices. It provides a
   Network Address Translator function that maps the mobile device's IP
   address and port number combination to a public IP address and port
   number. In this condition, the downstream  CDN receives content
   request from the WAP Gateway's IP address. The IP address of mobile
   devices assigned by mobile core network cannot be seen by dCDN.

   Typically, the amount of WAP gateway is much less than that of the
   Core Network entities (i.e. GGSN and PDSN). In real deployments,
   several GGSN/PDSN is connected to one WAP Gateway.

   CSPs often need to restrict content access to users in certain
   regions (e.g., within a given country or through a given access
   network). In some cases, CSP may need to apply geo-blocking policy
   with finer granularity (e.g., in province level or city level). So
   common geo-blocking information (i.e., AS number and IP subnet)
   cannot provide such kind of location information very well.

   Scenario 2:
   MSISDN is the most important numbers used for identifying a mobile
   subscriber. For data services and applications provided by network
   operator, MSISDN is usually used as user's default account, so the
   users do not need to input username and password manually.

   MSISDN consists of following parts:
   O CC Country code.
   O NDC National destination code.
   O SN Subscriber number(e.g., H0 H1 H2 H3 A B C D)

   The first few digits of SN specify HLR Identifier, which is also
   used to provide user's area information. An assignment example in
   China Mobile is shown in Table 1.

   In some cases, CSPs need t apply blocking policy using MSISDN
   information. In this condition, MSISDN should be taken into
   consideration for precise control policy. Even roaming to other area,
   a mobile user can still have right to access the content.

5. Delivery Criteria Extension


   The CDNI Metadata interface allows signaling of content distribution
   control policies, such as geo-blocking information, availability
   windows, and delegation whitelist/blacklist. To achieve more precise
   control of blocking policy for mobile network, more information
   should be able to convey via in-band mechanisms, and be considered
   by the downstream CDN when delivering content to users.

   The Delivery Criteria object specifies a set of criteria to match
   against incoming content requests including protocol, region and
   time window. The Region object specifies a region where the content
   is either allowed or disallowed. A region may be described in
   several ways, only one of which needs to be present per Region
   object. The object includes the following fields:
   O country - a string containing the country code for the region.
   O bgpAs - a number containing the BGP AS identifier of the region.
   O subnet - a string containing a dotted decimal IP address and
   subnet mask, here the IP address is the source IP address in IP
   layer.
   O msdnPrefix - a few digits in MSISDN specifying user's home area
   information in mobile network. MSISDN should be extracted from HTTP
   Header by the surrogate of downstream CDN.
   O subnet2 - a string containing a dotted decimal IP address
   extracted from the HTTP x-forwarded-for header and the corresponding
   subnet mask, which specifies the real IP address of mobile devices
   assigned by mobile core network. The IP address should be extracted
   from HTTP Header by the surrogate of downstream CDN.

   If the Region object is set and the IP address or MSISDN of a
   requesting client does not match any of the metadata listed, the
   downstream CDN should respond to the content request with a 403
   Forbidden status code.
