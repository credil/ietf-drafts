    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a method of algorithmic load balancing for
      DHCPv6 traffic.  It enables multiple, cooperating servers to decide which
      one should service a client, without exchanging any information beyond
      initial configuration.

      The server selection is based on the servers hashing client DHCP Unique
      Identifiers (DUIDs) when multiple IPv6 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
      (DHCPv6) servers are available to service DHCPv6 clients.  The proposed
      technique provides for efficient server selection when multiple DHCPv6
      servers offer services on a network without requiring any changes to
      existing DHCPv6 clients.  The same method is proposed to select the target
      server of a DHCPv6 relay.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This protocol is intended to extend the algorithm described in
      <xref target="RFC3074">RFC 3074</xref> to apply to DHCPv6 traffic.
      Most of the terminology and procedures are identical to the ones
      specified in RFC 3074.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Background and External Requirements">
       <t>The requirements for DHCPv6 are substantially the same as for
       DHCPv4, replacing DHCPDISCOVER with SOLICIT, DHCPREQUEST with
       REQUEST, CONFIRM, RENEW, or REBIND (as appropriate), etc.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operation">
      <t>
      A DHCPv6 server performing this load balancing will operate in
      substantially the same manner as if it were a DHCPv4 server load
      balancing an incoming DHCPv4/BOOTP packet with the following two
      differences.</t>

      <section title="Selecting the STID">
        <t>DHCPv6 servers MUST use the client's DUID as the STID.  At most the
        first 16 bytes of the DUID are used.  Of the 4 DUID types that currently
        exist, only a DUID-UUID <xref target="RFC6355"></xref> is guaranteed
        to exceed 16 bytes.  The variability of the first 14 bytes of the UUID
        should be sufficient to allow for the hashing function to perform adequately.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Replacing the secs field">
        <t>A DHCPv6 server providing the capability of Delayed Service
        SHOULD use the value in the OPTION_ELAPSED_TIME wherever RFC 3074
        makes reference to the secs field.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
   <t>This proposal in and by itself provides no security, nor does it
   impact existing security.  Servers using this algorithm are
   responsible for ensuring that if the contents of the HBA are
   transmitted over the network as part of the process of configuring
   any server, that message be secured against tampering, since
   tampering with the HBA could result in denial of service for some or
   all clients.</t>
