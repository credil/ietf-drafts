<!-- 3 Scenario of mobile router mobility-->

<section title="Scenario of mobile router mobility">
	<t>
		This section discusses the scenario of mobile router mobility.
		The scenario of mobile router mobility is illustrated in figure 1.
		The mobile router is located in the vehicle. The mobile router works as
		the network access point for the mobile router users. The mobile router
		user include vehicle applications and other on board system. Example of
		such application may include vehicle security and monitoring system.
		The users or other vehicle may access the vehicle application from
		Internet or from other vehicle. The requirement for the mobile router
		in this architecture is that it should allow the user to access the 
		vehicle application even when the vehicle is moving.

<!-- 4 Architecture and work flow of mobile router mobility -->

<section title="Architecture and work flow of the mobile router mobility solution">
	<t>
		The architecture of the mobile router mobility solution is illustrated in figure 2.
		The architecture is composed in three component: the mobile router, the home agent and the DNS.
		The vehicle application runs in the mobile router environment. The users can access to the
		vehicle application from Internet when the vehicle is moving. The key problem is that how to
		find the vehicle's identity when the vehicle is moving. The solution discussed in this
		document uses domain name as the vehicle's application identity.

			<list style='hanging'>

				<t hangText='1. Binding update'>
					When the mobile router is powered on, it will send DSMIPv6 binding update
					to the home agent. The binding update request contains the identification
					of the mobile router, the home address of the mobile router, the access
					network allocated car-of address of the mobile router.

					For the mobile router's first time network attachment, the home address
					could be set to all zero.
					<vspace blankLines="1" />
				</t>

				<t hangText='2. Binding cache update and IP address allocation'>
					The home agent receives the binding update, it will register the
					binding cache entry and allocate IP address for the mobile router.
					This IP address is the home address of the mobile router that 
					used in the period of communication session.					
					<vspace blankLines="1" />
				</t>

				<t hangText='3. Dome name register'>
					The home agent send the domain name register request to the DNS
					system. The DNS record optional include both the home address of the 
					mobile router and the tunnel type and port information. 
					See <xref target="RFC2136"/>.
					<vspace blankLines="1" />
				</t>

				<t hangText='4. Binding Ack'>
					After the success register of the mobile router's domain name,
					the home agent send binding ack message to the mobile router
					to trigger the mobility tunnel establishment.
					<vspace blankLines="1" />
				</t>

				<t hangText='5. Mobility tunnel establishment'>
					After the success receiving of binding ack message,
					the mobile router set up the mobility tunnel between the mobile 
					router and the home agent.
					<vspace blankLines="1" />
				</t>

				<t hangText='6. DNS query from the user/other vehicle'>
					The user or other vehicles send the DNS query request to 
					the DNS system to get the IP address and port information
					of the mobile router. The DNS system will response to the
					DNS query request with the mobile router's IP address and
					other information(port number and tunnel type)
					<vspace blankLines="1" />
				</t>

				<t hangText='7. Service connection establish'>
					The user or other vehicles application use the IP address
					and port information to establish the service level
					connection to the mobile router. e.g. TCP connection.
