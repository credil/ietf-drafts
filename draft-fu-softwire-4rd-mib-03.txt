1. Introduction

   4rd [I-D. draft-ietf-softwire-4rd] is a stateless mechanism for
   running IPv4 over IPv6-only infrastructure. It provides both IPv4 and
   IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-
   existing period.

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for using with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. This MIB module may be used for monitoring the devices in
   the 4rd scenario.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the MIB. MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

3. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4. Structure of the MIB Module

   The 4rd MIB provides a way to configure and manage the devices in 4rd
   scenario through SNMP.

   4rd MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis. It depends on
   several parts of the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

     4.1. The fourRdRule Subtree

   The fourRdRule subtree describes managed objects used for managing
   the multiple mapping rules in the 4rd scenario.

     4.2. The fourRdConformance Subtree

   The Subtree provides conformance information of MIB objects.

5. MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   This MIB module IMPORTs objects from [RFC2580], [RFC2578], [RFC2863],
   [RFC4001], [RFC3411].

7. IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------
      FourRd-MIB          { transmission XXX }

8. Security Considerations

   The 4rd MIB module can be used for configuration of certain objects,
   and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured,
   with potentially disastrous results. Because this MIB module reuses
   the NAT MIB, the security considerations for these MIBs are also
   applicable to the 4rd MIB.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principles (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
