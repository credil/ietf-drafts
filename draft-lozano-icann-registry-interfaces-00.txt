Internet-Draft          ICANN Registry Interfaces             March 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the interfaces between ICANN and Registries
   and Data Escrow Agents.  These interfaces allow Registries and Data
   Escrow Agents upload the reports described in the Base Agreement of
   the new gTLD Applicant Guidebook.

   Authentication credentials for the interfaces described above are
   provided per TLD.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   "iirdea-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iirdea-1.0".  The XML namespace prefix
   "iirdea" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.


2.  Specification 2 - Data Escrow Reporting

   This section describes the interfaces provided by ICANN for Registry
   Operators and Data Escrow Agents to comply with the reporting
   provisions detailed in Specification 2 of the Base Agreement of the
   new gTLD Applicant Guidebook [ICANN-GTLD-AGB-20120604].

2.1.  Registry Operator Reporting

   The new gTLD base Registry Agreement, Specification 2, Part A,
   Section 7 requires Registry Operators to provide ICANN with a written
   statement that includes a copy of the report generated upon creation
   of an escrow deposit and a statement that the deposit has been
   inspected by the Registry Operator and is complete and accurate.

   In order to comply with this provision, the Registry Operator sends a
   report to ICANN for each escrow deposit successfully received by the
   Data Escrow Agent, using the PUT HTTP verb in the interface provided
   by ICANN at:

      https://ry-api.icann.org/report/registry-escrow-report

   Registries MUST send a <rdeReport:report> object as defined in
   [I-D.arias-noguchi-dnrd-objects-mapping].

   After successfully receiving a <rdeReport:report> object, ICANN
   validates it and provides a result code in the same HTTP transaction.

   After sending the result code, the interface closes the TCP
   connection.

   At 23:59 UTC, the last successful validated <rdeReport:report> object
   is stored and used by ICANN.

2.1.1.  Result codes

   The following table lists the result codes of the interface:

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Result    | Description                                           |
   | Code      |                                                       |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | 1000      | No ERRORs were found and the report has been accepted |
   |           | by ICANN.                                             |
   | 2001      | The report did not validate against the schema.       |
   | 2002      | A report for that day already exists, the cut-off     |
   |           | date already passed.                                  |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

                    Data Escrow Reporting Result Codes

2.2.  Data Escrow Agent Reporting

   The new gTLD base Registry Agreement, Specification 2, Part B,
   Section 7 requires Data Escrow Agents to deliver ICANN, a data escrow
   notification when a escrow deposit is successfully received from the
   Registry Operator regardless of the final status of the verification
   process.

   In order to comply with this provision, the Data Escrow Agent sends a
   notification to ICANN for each escrow deposit received from the
   Registry Operator, using the PUT HTTP verb in the interface provided
   by ICANN at:

      https://ry-api.icann.org/report/escrow-agent-notification

   Data Escrow Agents MUST send a <rdeNotification:notification> object
   as defined in [I-D.arias-noguchi-dnrd-objects-mapping].

   After successfully receiving a <rdeNotification:notification>, ICANN
   validates it and provides a result code in the same HTTP transaction.

   After sending the result code, the interface closes the TCP
   connection.

   At 23:59 UTC, the last successful validated <rdeNotification:
   notification> object is stored and used by ICANN.

2.2.1.  Interface result code

   The following table lists the result codes of the interface:

   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | Result   | Description                                            |
   | Code     |                                                        |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | 1000     | No ERRORs were found and the notification has been     |
   |          | accepted by ICANN.                                     |
   | 2001     | The notification did not validate against the schema.  |
   | 2002     | A notification for that day already exists, the        |
   |          | cut-off date already passed.                           |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

                    Data Escrow Reporting Result Codes


3.  Specification 3 - Registry Operator Monthly Reporting

   Specification 3 of the new gTLD base Registry Agreement requires
   Registry Operators to provide a set of monthly reports per gTLD.  Two
   type of reports are required to be sent by Registries: Per-Registrar
   Transactions Report and Registry Functions Activity Report.  This
   section specifies the interface provided by ICANN to automate the
   upload of these reports by Registry Operators.

   The cut-off date for the reception of the previous month report is
   the day 20 (23:59 UTC) of the current month, as described in the new
   gTLD Applicant Guidebook [ICANN-GTLD-AGB-20120604].  Before the cut-
   off date the Registry Operator could replace a successfully validated
   report as many times as it needs.

3.1.  Per-Registrar Transactions Report

   The Per-Registrar Transactions Report is a CSV report described in
   Section 1 of Specification 3.

   In order to comply with this provision, the Registry Operator sends a

   CSV report on a monthly basis as described in the Agreement, using
   the PUT HTTP verb in the interface provided by ICANN at:

      https://ry-api.icann.org/report/registrar-transactions/<TLD>/
      <date>

      Where:

      *  <TLD> MUST be substituted by the TLD for which the reports is
         being provided.  In case of an IDN TLD, the A-label MUST be
         used.

      *  <date> MUST be substituted by the month for which the reports
         is being provided in the form of YYYY-MM.  Where 'YYYY' is the
         year and 'MM' is the two digit month number.  For example:
         2013-03

   After successfully receiving a report, ICANN validates it and
   provides a result code in the same HTTP transaction.

   After sending the result code, the interface closes the TCP
   connection.

3.1.1.  Interface result codes

   The following table lists the result codes of the interface:

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Result    | Description                                           |
   | Code      |                                                       |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | 1000      | No ERRORs were found and the report has been accepted |
   |           | by ICANN.                                             |
   | 2001      | The structure of the report is invalid.               |
   | 2002      | A report for that month already exists, the cut-off   |
   |           | date already passed.                                  |
   | 2003      | Negative numeric value present in the report.         |
   | 2101      | Incorrect totals present in the report.               |
   | 2102      | Non ICANN accredited registrar present in the report. |

3.2.  Registry Functions Activity Report

   The Registry Functions Activity Report is a CSV report described in
   Specification 3, 2 of the new gTLD Applicant Guidebook
   [ICANN-GTLD-AGB-20120604].

   In order to comply with this provision, the Registry Operator sends a
   CSV report on a montly basis as described in the Agreement, using the
   PUT HTTP verb in the interface provided by ICANN at:

      https://ry-api.icann.org/report/registry-functions-activity/<TLD>/
      <date>

      Where:

      *  <TLD> MUST be substituted by the TLD for which the report is
         being provided.  In case of an IDN TLD, the A-label MUST be
         used.

      *  <date> MUST be substituted by the month for which the reports
         is being provided in the form of YYYY-MM.  Where 'YYYY' is the
         year and 'MM' is the two digit month number.  For example:
         2013-03

   After sucessfuly receiving a report, ICANN validates it and provides
   a result code in the same HTTP transaction.

   After sending the result code, the interface closes the TCP
   connection.

3.2.1.  Interface result codes

4.  IIRDEA Result Object

   After processing the input provided in the interface, a response
   object as defined by the schema in Section 5 is provided.

   The interface provides a HTTP/200 status code when the interface was
   able to receive the input and sent a response.

   The interface provides a HTTP/500 status code when the system is
   experiencing a general failure.

   An example of a response object is presented below:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <response xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iirdea-1.0">
     <result code="1000">
       <msg>No error</msg>
       <description>
          The report has been accepted by ICANN.
          Processing of the report will take place at 23:59 UTC.
       </description>
     </result>
   </response>


5.  Formal Syntax

   The schema of the IIRDEA result code is presented here.

   The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they are used to
   note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI registration
   purposes.
