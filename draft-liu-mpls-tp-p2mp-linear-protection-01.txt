          Applicability of MPLS-TP Linear protection for p2mp
              draft-liu-mpls-tp-p2mp-linear-protection-01

Abstract

   In MPLS-TP requirement document(rfc5654), there is a requirement to
   support 1+1 and 1:n protection for p2mp connectivity.  The
   requirement was described in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework
   document(RFC 6372) and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework.  The basic
   protocol for linear protection was specified in the MPLS-TP Linear
   Protection document [RFC 6378] but is limited to 1+1 and 1:1
   protection for p2p connectivity.  in addtion, The 1:N protection in
   which all of working transport paths and the protection path have the
   same end points was specified in MPLS-TP 1:N protection document
   (draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection).This document applies the
   existing PSC(RFC 6378) and extensive PSC protocol(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-
   1toN-protection) to support scenarios of protecting the p2mp path by
   extending the existing p2p linear protection mechanism.  .


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
   Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include
   an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
   to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
   network as defined by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP P2MP Linear protection           March 2013


   The MPLS Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Requirement document(RFC5654) and
   MPLS-TP P2MP Framework document both describe the requirement that
   unidirectional 1+1 and 1:n protection for p2mp connectivity must be
   supported.  while the MPLS-TP Survivability Framework(RFC6372) is
   only a framework for survivability in MPLS-TP network.

   MPLS-TP Linear protection document(RFC6378) defines a Protection
   State Coordination(PSC) protocol that supports 1+1 and 1:1 protection
   architectures descirbed in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework.  The PSC
   protocol is a single-phase protocol that allows the two endpoints of
   the protection domain to coordinate the protection switching
   operation when a change of state is detected on the transport path of
   the protection domain.

   MPLS-TP 1:N protection document(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection)
   uses a two-phase extensive PSC protocol to protect multiple working
   paths by a single protection path.

   As for the p2mp path, It has multiple leaf nodes and is still
   undirectional, so it is not good for p2mp path to use the protection
   mechanism in RFC6378 and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection.  The
   document is an applicability of the existing PSC protocol and the
   extensive PSC protocol to support protection of p2mp path by
   extending the existing linear protection mechanism.

1.1.  1+1 p2mp protection

   This protection is a specific protection that use one designated
   protection path to protect one working path.  It is fully pre-
   allocated in the sense that the route and bandwidth resource of the
   protection path is reserved for the working path, The source root
   node will bridge both the working path and the protection path at the
   same time.  while the sink leaf nodes will select one of the two
   paths to receive the traffic . As it is unnecessary to coordinate the
   switch state between the root node and the leaf nodes , the PSC
   protocol is not needed in the 1+1 protection mechanism.

                       Figure 1: 1+1 p2mp protection

   Figure 1 shows a protection domain with one working path and its
   corresponding protection path.For 1+1 protection mechanism, the p2mp
   traffic must be transported on both working path and protection path
   at any time.  So the source root node always bridges the p2mp traffic
   into both working path and protection path.  While the sink leaf node
   L1 and L2 will select one of the two paths to receive the traffic
   based on the performance of the two paths.  It isn't necessary to
   coordinate the switch state between the source root node and the sink
   leaf nodes.  So it can't use the PSC protocol for the protection
   mechanism;

1.2.  1:1 p2mp per-tree protection

   The protection mechanism will still use one designated p2mp
   protection path to protect one p2mp working path.While the source
   root node only bridges one of the two paths at any time.  All sink
   leaf nodes select the same p2mp path to receive the traffic.  In
   addition, As the root node and leaf nodes need to coordinate to
   select the same p2mp path to send and receive the p2mp traffic.  it
   Must use the existing PSC protocol to coordinate the switch state
   between the root node and the leaf nodes.

   Just as the above figure 1, Under normal condition, The p2mp traffic
   will be transported by only the working path from node r to node L1
   and L2.  When a defect is detected on the working path.  the source

   node r will bridge the traffic into its corresponding protection
   path.  Then it should send PSC packet to all leaf nodes L1 and L2 to
   notify them to select the protection path to receive the p2mp
   traffic.

1.3.  1:1 p2mp per-leaf protection

   This protection is similar to the above protection mechanism.It still
   needs to pre-configure one p2mp protection path to protect a p2mp
   working path.  When a defect is detected on the working path.  the
   source root node firstly bridge both the working path and the
   protection path to send the traffic on both paths.  While the leaf
   nodes will select one of the two paths to receive the traffic based
   on whether the working path has defect.  Here it is unnecessary to
   use PSC protocol to coordinate the switch state between the root node
   and the leaf nodes.

   Just as the above figure 1,When a defect is detected on one branch
   path of the p2mp working path, For example, Path(r-L1) or path(r-L2)
   has a defect, The source root node r will firstly send the traffic on
   both the working path and the protection path.  L1 or L2 will select
   one of the two paths to receive the traffic based on whether to have
   a defect on its branch path(r-L1) or path(r-L2)..

1.4.  1:1 p2mp branch path protection

   The protection mechanism will pre-configure one p2p protection path
   for each branch path of a p2mp working path.  Each branch path is
   disjointed from its p2p protection path.  The protection mechanism is
   similar to 1:1 protection mechanism in MPLS-TP linear
   protection(RFC3678), It needs to use the PSC protocol to coordinate
   the switch state between the root node and the leaf nodes.

                                 Figure 2

   Just as the above figure 2, It will pre-configure one p2p protection
   path for each branch path(r-L1) and (r-L2) individually.When a defect
   is detected on the branch path.  the root node r will send PSC packet
   to its peer leaf node L1 or L2 immediately , Then the protected
   traffic will be switched into its p2p protection path to be
   transported.  While the leaf node L1 or L2 will select the protection
   path to receive the traffic

1.5.  1:n p2mp shared protection

   The protection will pre-configure one p2mp shared protection path to
   protect multiple p2mp working paths which maybe have differnet end
   points.  So the leaf nodes of the p2mp shared protection path are all
   leaf nodes of these protected p2mp working paths.When a defect is
   deteced on a working path, the root node of the protection path will
   send the existing extensive PSC protocol packet to its leaf nodes to
   identify which p2mp working path will be selected to be protected.
   When the leaf node receives the PSC packet and decides how to process
   the traffic packet from the p2mp shared protection path.Just as
   figure 3.

                                 Figure 3

   A single p2mp shared protection path is used to protect p2mp working
   path 1 and p2mp working path 2.  node L1 and L2 are the sink leaf
   nodes of the p2mp working path 1.  While node L2 and L3 are the sink
   leaf nodes of the p2mp working path 2.  The leaf nodes of the p2mp
   shared protection path are L1 , L2 and L3.When a defect is detected
   on both the working path 1 and the working path 2 at the same time.
   The root node r of the p2mp shared protection path will select a
   higher priority working path to be protected.  Then the source root
   node sends extensive PSC protocol packet to all leaf nodes L1,L2 and
   L3 by the p2mp shared protection path.The leaf nodes L1,L2 and L3 can
   judge whether to receive the traffic from the protection path based
   on the extensive PSC protocol packet.

   Some protection mechanisms in this document need PSC protocol to

   It will use the existing PSC protocol to be defined in MPLS-TP Linear
   protection(RFC6378) in the 1:1 p2mp protection scenario including 1:1
   p2mp per-tree protection , 1:1 P2MP branch path protection.  The PSC
   protocol in detail maybe reference to the MPLS-TP linear
   protection(RFC6378).  While 1:n shared p2mp protection may use the
   extensive PSC protocol defined in the MPLS-TP 1:N protection(draft-
   ietf-mpls-tp-1ton-protection) to implement the protection.So the
   procedure of extensive PSC protocol maybe reference to the mpls-tp
   1:N protection document.  But the 1:n shared p2mp protection in this
   document only uses single-phase protocol which is different from the
   1:n protection for p2p path.  And it is only non-locking operation
   and the value of L field can't be set.  In addition, It is
   unnecessary for the protection mechanism to wait for peer node's
   Acknowledge(WFA), So the parameter of WFA timer isn't necessary in
   this document.

   In all above protection mechanisms, They must firstly pre-configure
   protection path for one or multiple p2mp working path.  Then They
   detect whether to have a defect on the working path.  If a defect is
   detected, the end point of the p2mp working path will swich the
   traffic from its working path to its pre-configurated protection path

4.1.  1+1 protection operation

   The procedure of 1+1 protection operation is the following :

   1 Under normal condition, The root node bridges the protected p2mp
   traffic into its working path and protection path, While its sink
   leaf nodes will select the working path to receive the traffic.

   2 A defect is detected on the working path, some leaf nodes will
   select its protection path to receive the traffic packet which have
   defect on their branch path.of the working path

4.2.  1:1 p2mp per-tree protection operation

   The procedure of this protection switch is the following phase:

   1 Under normal condition, The root node and leaf nodes will send or
   receive the traffic by their working path.And the root node will send
   NR(0,0) to all leaf nodes by PSC packet.

   2 When a defect is already detected on the working path, the root
   node will bridge from the working path to its corresponding
   protection path.  Then send SF(1,1) to all leaf nodes by PSC packet..

   3 The leaf nodes receive the SF(1,1) PSC packet, All of them will
   switch to receive the traffic by their protection path.

4.3.  1:1 p2mp per-leaf protection operation

   The procedure of the protection is the following :

   1 The root node will select its working path to send the traffic
   under normal condition ,And each leaf node still selects the working
   path to receive the traffic.

   2 When a defect is detected on a branch path of the p2mp working
   path.  the root node will bridge both the working path and the
   protection path . The leaf node will select one of the two paths to
   receive the traffic based on whether a defect happens on the working
   path.

   3 If a leaf node detect a defect on its branch path of the p2mp
   working path, IT will select its corresponding protection path to
   receive the p2mp traffic packet.  or else, it will continue to
   receive the p2mp traffic packet from its working path.

4.4.  1:1 p2mp branch path protection operation

   The procedure of the protection operation is the following :

   1 Under normal condition, The root node and all leaf nodes of a p2mp
   traffic will select their p2mp working path to send and receive the
   traffic.  At the same time, The root node sends NR(0,0) PSC packet to
   each leaf node by its p2p protection path periodically.

   2 When a defect is detected on a branch path of the p2mp working
   path, The root node will bridge the traffic into its corresponding
   p2p protection path and send SF(1,1) PSC packet to the leaf node of
   the failed branch path.

   3 The leaf node receives SF(1,1) PSC packet,It will switch from the
   working path to the p2p protection path to receive the traffic.Other
   leaf nodes will still receive the traffic from the working path.

4.5.  1:n p2mp shared protection operation

   the procedure of this protection operation is the following :

   1 Under normal condition, The root node and all leaf nodes will
   select their p2mp working path to send and receive the traffic, The
   root node sends NR(0,0) PSC packet to all leaf nodes of the p2mp
   protection path periodically.

   2 A defect is detected on one or multiple p2mp working path , The
   root node will select the highest priority working path to be
   protected.and send SF(n,n) to all leaf nodes of the shared protection
   path.  Here n indicates the identifier index of the p2mp working path
   to be protected.At the same time, The root node begin to send the
   traffic to be selected on the p2mp shared protection path.

   3 When all leaf nodes of the p2mp shared protection path receive
   SF(n,n) PSC packet.  they will know whether to receive the traffic
   from the p2mp shared protection path.  If a leaf node is a sink node
   of the p2mp working path to be protected, it will receive the traffic
   from the shared protection path.  or else, It directly abandon the
   traffic from the p2mp shared protection path.
