        Definition of Managed Objects for Performance Reporting
                     draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-03

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous report
   generation on any device that supports MIBs containing counter and
   gauge objects for performance monitoring.  This allows a management
   station to instruct a device to build off-line reports to be
   collected asynchronously by the management station.  Further, this
   REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB can be configured in a proxy configuration where
   the report generation is performed on a device in close network
   proximity to the device containing the referenced counter objects.
   Hence, this capability allows network operators to reduce the SNMP
   polling traffic burden on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Disruption Tolerant
   Networks which is typical of SNMP performance management
   applications.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            November 2012


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous, off-
   line report generation for performance monitoring on any device
   supporting MIBs containing variables that resolve to type Integer32
   (i.e., Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks).  This REPORT-
   SAMPLED-MIB allows for the report generation to occur on the same
   device as containing the referenced counter object or on a device in
   close network proximity to the device with the referenced counter
   object.  This should be useful to devices or networks where efficient
   use of bandwidth is of concern or where intermittent connectivity is
   common.  Hence, the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB is useful for devices managed
   over some Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) or Disruption Tolerant
   Networks (DTNs).

   This version of the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB offers one type of off-line
   reporting.  The MIB offers a means to collect sampled data related to
   defined MIB objects.  This type of reporting is contained in the
   reportSampledGroup.  Other types of report data are possible,
   including statistical data and historical data.  However, it was felt
   wise to focus on a more limited scope off-line reporting capability
   and gain experimental use and application prior to expending energy
   developing a more extensive capability.

   For the collection of sampled data, the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB draws
   directly from the usrHistoryGroup from RMON 2 [RFC2021] through
   application of the 'AUGMENTS' clause. .  Here the
   reportSampledControlTable allows the user to define aspects of the
   report for sampled data, including the number of MIB objects to be
   sampled and the nature of the sampling frequency and overall report
   duration.  This group uses the notion of buckets, which contain
   sampled data from a set of identified MIB objects sampled at the same
   time point.  The report consists of the buckets, each containing sets
   of sampled data from the selected MIB objects but at the specific
   sampling times.  The reportSampledObjectTable allows the user to
   identify the multiple MIB objects to be sampled.  The
   reportSampledDataTable contains the storage of the reported sampled
   data contained within buckets, one bucket for each time sampling
   instance.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            November 2012


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB references performance objects in other MIBs
   (and in other devices) and generates off-line performance reports
   related to those referenced objects.  The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB can be
   coincident with the other MIB or can reside on another device in
   close network proximity to the device containing the referenced
   performance related object.

4.1.  REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the REPORT-SAMPLED-
   MIB process.

   Figure 1 illustrates a potential use of the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB for
   the generation of off-line, remotely generated reports.  The
   management station on the left hand side of the illustration
   instructs the remote device to create reports through manipulation of
   the ReportCntrl Objects in the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB resident on the
   remote device.  The reports instruct the device to monitor the status
   of specified counters (on other MIBs and potentially on other devices
   in close network proximity) periodically.  The reports are stored
   locally until the management station decides to pull them off the
   device.  The figure shows a case where the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB
   generates a notification that Report_2 has completed, prompting the
   management station to pull Report_2 from the device.

   Figure 1: REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB front-end report generation process.

   This version of the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB provides for the collection of
   sampled data instead of statistical data.  It does this by augmenting
   the usrHistory group from RMON2 [RFC2021] which allows for the
   generation of reports collecting the sampled object values binned for
   the purpose of aggregation and efficiency of collection.  These are

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            November 2012


   defined within the reportSampledGroup.  The model used for this type
   of report generation is based upon three tables.  The
   reportSampledControlTable defines aspects of the report generation
   related to duration of the reporting interval, the bin (or bucket)
   sizes for the report, and the number of object values collected for
   each bucket.  The reportUsrHistoryObjectTable identifies the specific
   MIB objects whose values are binned within the report.  And the
   reportSampledDataTable contains the binned data values collected for
   the report.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Control - Objects defined within this document which set the
      parameters for specific reports to be generated offline on the the
      remote managed device.

   o  Data - Objects which hold the sampled report data.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB module.
   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  reportSampledMIBNotifications - defines the notifications
      associated with the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB.

   o  reportSampledMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis
      for the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB.  These objects are divided up by
      function into the following groups (currently only one group is
      defined):

   o

      *  Sampled Group - This group contains the objects which support
         the generation (collection) of reports exposing sampled data
         values.

   o  reportSampledMIBConformance - Defines a variety of conformance of
      implementations of this REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   No textual conventions are used in the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            November 2012


5.2.  The Sampled Group

   The Sampled Group contains tables which allows for the development of
   reports based upon sampling the referenced counter objects at
   specified intervals.  The development of this group within the
   REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB which augments the User History group from the
   RMON 2 MIB [RFC2021].  The Sampled Group is composed of:

   o  reportSampledControlTable - allows for the setting of the
      parameters of the report.

   o  reportSampledObjectTable - sets the referenced objects to be
      sampled during the test.  With this capability, the management
      application can reference multiple objects, all of which are
      sampled during the test and reported out through the
      reportSampledData Table.

   o  reportSampledDataTable - contains the reports.

5.3.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Sub-tree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB and their intended purpose or
   utility.  The single notification defined within this MIB module is
   the 'reportSampledNewDataReport'.  This notification is sent by the
   agent upon completion of a given report on the device.  The
   notification contains the following objects:
   'usrHistoryControlOwner', the entity that configured this report
   entry, and the 'reportSampledReportIndex', the index of the data
   table for this report.  Collectively, these objects allow the
   management application to pull the completed report from the agent.

5.4.  Tables and Indexing

   The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB module contains a number of tables which
   record data related to:

   o  the control and generation of remote performance reports,

   o  the storage of remote performance reports, and

   o  the notification of remote report completion.

   The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB module's tables are indexed via the following
   constructs:

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            November 2012


   o  usrHistoryControlIndex - from the RMON2-MIB [RFC2021], an index
      that uniquely identifies an entry in the usrHistoryControlTable.
      Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval
      for a specified set of MIB instances available from the managed
      system.

   o  usrHistoryObjectIndex - from the RMON2-MIB, an index used to
      uniquely identify an entry in the usrHistoryObject table from the
      RMON2-MIB.  Each such entry defines a MIB instance to be collected
      periodically.

   o  reportSampledReportIndex - an index that uniquely identifies the
      particular report an entry is associated with among the set of
      reports requested through the reportSampledControlNumber in the
      reportSampledControlEntry.

   o  reportSampledSampleIndex - an index that uniquely identifies the
      particular sample this entry represents among all samples
      associated with the same reportSampledControlEntry.

   These tables and their indexing are:

   o  reportSampledControlTable - this table contains a list of data-
      collection configuration entries defining aspects of the reports.
      These include, e.g., number of reports, their start and stop
      times, etc.  This table 'AUGMENTS { usrHistoryControlEntry }'.

   o  reportSampledObjectTable - this table contains a list of data-
      collection configuration entries which identify specific MIB
      entries on other devices to monitor.  This table 'AUGMENTS {
      usrHistoryObjectEntry }'.

   o  reportSampledTable - this table contains a list of historical
      samples collected for the report.  This table has 'INDEX {
      usrHistoryControlIndex, reportSampledReportIndex,
      reportSampledSampleIndex, usrHistoryObjectIndex }'.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The text of this section specifies the relationship of the MIB
   modules contained in this document to other standards, particularly
   to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions imported from
   other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in
   conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are
   identified in this section.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            November 2012


6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB
   does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the RMON2-MIB

   The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB is closely related to the RMON2-MIB [RFC2021]
   usrHistoryGroup.  Specifically, the reportSampledGroup is a direct
   copy of the RMON2 User History Group, with the names changed to
   comply with the naming conventions within the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB.
   Further, the design and use of the control tables within the REPORT-
   SAMPLED-MIB draw exactly from the definition of these table
   structures in the earlier RMON MIBs through the use of the 'AUGMENTS'
   clause within the 'reportSampledControlTable' and the
   'reportSampledTable' in this MIB module.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any module
   mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a REFERENCE
   clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited someplace within
   the narrative sections.  Therefore, the imported items in this MIB
   module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already cited, are
   cited in this section.  Since relationships to other MIB modules
   should be described in the narrative text, this section will cite
   modules from which Textual Conventions are imported.

   The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], and INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].  Significantly, the
   REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB module also IMPORTS objects from the RMON2-MIB
   module [RFC2021].

8.  Security Considerations

   This REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB defines a capability where the local device
   may poll other remote devices to collect performance data accessible
   through other MIB modules on the remote devices.  These capabilities
   defined within the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB are control-able by a network
   management application through SNMP.  As such, a network management
   application could potentially use the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB as a
   mechanism to implement a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack
   against remote devices.  Care should be taken to secure access to the
   REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB agent.  Specifically, access control mechanisms
   and authentication mechanisms (via SNMPv3) should always be used for
   SNMP SET operations.  Further, some objects may contain data deemed
   sensitive and authentication and encryption mechanisms (via SNMPv3)

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            November 2012


   should be used for SNMP GET operations.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The reportSampledControlTable is a writable table whose columnar
      objects are read-create.  The following objects with MAX ACCESS of
      read-create and their security sensitivities are:

   o

      *  usrHistoryControlBucketRequested - this object identifies the
         requested number of buckets (or intervals) requested for each
         identified object for each report instance.  As such, this
         related to the total device memory necessary to hold the
         collected data for the identified reports.  The device must
         determine whether it has the necessary storage.  If not, the
         device can indicate the available storage through the
         usrHistoryControlBucketGranted object within this table.  The
         device to protect itself against memory overruns.

      *  usrHistoryControlInterval - this object identifies the time
         interval being sampling events.  If set too low, the device may
         not be able to sample the object on remote devices fast enough
         to satisfy the requested interval.  Further, setting this value
         too low could be used to overwhelm the processing capabilities
         of the remote agent, resulting in a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
         attack.

      *  reportSampledControlRequestedNumber - this object identifies
         the requested number of consecutive reports of this type to be
         generated and stored in this device.  When, the value of this
         object should be considered in the local device's estimates of
         memory consumption related to this control table row.

      *  usrHistoryControlOwner - this objects provides a name
         associated with the presumed identity of the application
         configuring this report.  If the local device or management
         applications attribute any authority to the values contained in
         this object, then it is critical to secure access to setting or
         modifying the value of this object.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            November 2012


      *  usrHistoryControlStatus - this is the RowStatus object
         controlling the configuration of this table row.

   o  The reportSampledObjectTable is a writable table whose columnar
      objects are read-create.  The following objects with MAX ACCESS of
      read-create and their security sensitivities are:

   o

      *  usrHistoryObjectVariable - this object identifies the specific
         OID on a (potentially) remote agent whose counter or gauge
         values are to be collected for the reports.  If, for whatever
         reason, the values of this OID collected within the report is
         deemed sensitive, then the SNMP GET operations issued to
         collect these values should use SNMPv3 authentication and
         encryption mechanisms to protect.

      *  reportSampledObjectIpAddrType - this object identifies the
         address type associated with the address of the agent whose OID
         data is being collected for the report.

      *  reportSampledObjectIpAddress - this object identifies the
         address associated with the address of the agent whose OID data
         is being collected for the report.  If the address of the
         remote devices is deemed sensitive, then the SNMP SETs which
         write or the SNMP GET which collect this information should be
         protected using SNMPv3 authentication and encryption
         mechanisms.

      *  usrHistoryObjectSampleType - this object identifies the the way
         in which data values are to be stored within the reports.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to

   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   remote report generation process on a router or close device.  This
   MIB module, denoted REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB, also reports performance
   information and notifications.  The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB provides for
   the remote control, collection and notification of performance
   reports on devices.  As such, it eliminates the need for periodic
   polling for counters from remote management stations as a means for
   generating performance reports.  This is hoped to greatly reduce
   management overhead on the MANET.  This sections provides some
   examples of how this MIB module can be used in MANET network
   deployments.  A fuller discussion of MANET network management use
   cases and challenges will be provided elsewhere.

   In the following, two scenarios are listed where this MIB module is
   useful, i.e.,

   o  For Mobile vehicles with Low Bandwidth Satellite Link to a Fixed
      NOC - Here the vehicles carrying the MANET routers carry multiple
      wireless interfaces, one of which is a relatively low-bandwidth
      on-the-move satellite connection which interconnects a fix NOC to
      the nodes of the MANET.  Standards-based methods for monitoring
      and fault management from the fixed NOC are necessary for this
      deployment option.  However, to reduce polling overhead over the
      low bandwidth communications links, the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB can be
      deployed the remote MANET nodes for the remote generation of
      performance reports.

   o  For Fixed NOC and Mobile Local Manager in Larger Vehicles - for
      larger vehicles, a hierarchical network management arrangement is
      useful.  Centralized network management is performed from a fixed
      NOC while local management is performed locally from within the
      vehicles.  Standards-based methods for configuration, monitoring,
      fault and performance management are necessary for this deployment
      option.

10.  IANA Considerations


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

Appendix A.  Change Log

   Changes from draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-01 to
   draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-02 draft.

   1.  Stripped the Statistical and the Historical Reports from this
       draft in order to greatly simplify the initial development and
       experiments of this MIB module.

   2.  Changed the RFC category to Experimental.

   3.  Completed the Security section.

   4.  Relied upon the AUGMENTS statement to simplify further this MIB
       definition.

   Changes from draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-00 to
   draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-01 draft.

   1.  Proposed additions to the statsReports in order to potentially
       simplify data transmission to management applications.

   2.  Added some Notification definitions and their relationship to the
       three reports' structure, i.e., statsReports, sampledReports, and
       historyReports.

   3.  In the process of adding notifications for the Sampled and the
       History reports, decided to restructure the reports from their
       previously rolling storage model to the fixed interval reporting
       used all along in the Statistics reporting.  This allows the

       agent to notify the management application that a report has
       completed and that it is ready to be pulled from the agent
       storage.

   4.  Ran MIB through smilint checker and cleaned up all errors and
       most warnings.  A few warnings remain to be addressed.

   5.  Cleaned up textual material.

   Changes from draft-cole-manet-report-mib-02 to
   draft-ietf-manet-report-mib-00 draft.

   1.  Major change was the incorporation of the IP address objects
       associated with all objects of type 'OBJECT IDENTIFIER'.  This
       allows the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB to exist as a proxy report
       generation capability on a device separate but in close proximity
       to the device monitoring the referenced object.

   2.  Cleaned up the up front text, reducing the repetition with the
       object descriptions in the MIB.

   3.  Worked on and added sections discussing the relationship to other
       MIBs.

   Changes from draft-cole-manet-report-mib-01 to
   draft-cole-manet-report-mib-02 draft.

   1.  Restructured the MIB somewhat to now offer the three reporting
       capabilities in increasing order of detail: a) statistical
       reports, b) sampled reports, and c) historical reports.

   2.  Renamed the usrHistoryGroup and elements to samplingGroup.  This
       is in line with its actual capabilities.

   3.  Added a new historyGroup which provides a history of change
       events.

   4.  Updated the4 Conformance section to reflect the above changes and
       additions.  But did not yet run smilint to check MIB syntax.

   Changes from draft-cole-manet-report-mib-00 to
   draft-cole-manet-report-mib-01 draft.

   1.  Added (copied) the usrHistory group from RMON2 into the REPORT-
       SAMPLED-MIB.

   2.  Restructured the MIB to account for the inclusion of the
       reportSampledGroup.

Internet-Draft           The REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB            November 2012


   3.  Dropped the reportCurReportsTable as this did not make sense
       within the context of the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB.

   4.  Added the Compliance and Conformance material.  Defined several
       Compliance Groups to all for base implementations of the REPORT-
       SAMPLED-MIB for only statistical reports, for only historical
       reports or for both.  Allow for enhanced implementations to
       address higher capacity issues and extension to metric reporting
       for statistical reporting.

   5.  Ran the MIB through the smilint checker and in the process
       corrected numerous typos, omissions, TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS,
       IMPORTS, etc.

   6.  Updated main text to reflect changes.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the REPORT-SAMPLED-MIB.  This section will
   not be present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed
   once all the open issues have been resolved.

   1.  Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
       DESCRIPTION clauses.
