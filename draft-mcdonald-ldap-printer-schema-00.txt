Abstract 

   This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes, for
   printers and printer services, for use with directories that support 
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510).  This document is
   based on the printer attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet
   Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) (RFC 2911).  A few additional printer
   attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB (RFC 1759),
   IEEE-ISTO PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID (PWG 5107.2), or
   IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (IPP JPS3).

Internet Draft      LDAP Schema for Printer Services      2 October 2011



1.  Introduction

   This document defines several object classes to provide Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510] applications with flexible
   options in defining printer information using LDAP schema.  Classes
   are provided for defining directory entries with common printer
   information as well as for extending existing directory entries with
   SLPv2 [RFC2608], IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], and LPR [RFC1179]
   protocol-specific information.  
   
   The schema defined in this document is based on the printer
   attributes listed in Appendix E 'Generic Directory Schema' of
   Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) [RFC2911].  A few additional
   printer attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB
   [RFC1759], IEEE-ISTO PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID (PWG
   5107.2), or IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (IPP
   JPS3).  
   
   The schema defined in this document is technically aligned with the
   stable IANA-registered 'service:printer:' v2.0 template [SLPPRT20],
   for compatibility with already deployed Service Location Protocol
   (SLPv2) [RFC2608] service advertising and discovery infrastructure.
   The attribute syntaxes are technically aligned with the
   'service:printer:' v2.0 template - therefore simpler types are
   sometimes used (for example, 'DirectoryString' [RFC4517] rather than
   'labeledURI' [RFC2079] for the 'printer-uri' attribute).  
   
   Please send comments directly to the authors at the addresses listed
   in the section "Authors' Addresses".  
   
   
   
   1.1.  Rationale for using DirectoryString Syntax
   
   The attribute syntax 'DirectoryString' (UTF-8 [STD63]) defined in
   [RFC4517] is specified for several groups of string attributes that
   are defined in this document:  
   
   1)  URI 
       - printer-uri, printer-xri-supported, printer-more-info 
       
       The UTF-8 encoding is compatible with deployment of (UTF-8 based)
       IRI Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987].  
       
   2)  Description 
       - printer-name, printer-location, printer-info,
       printer-make-and-model 
       
       The UTF-8 encoding supports descriptions in any language,

Internet Draft      LDAP Schema for Printer Services      2 October 2011

       conformant with the IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages
       [BCP18].  
       
       Note:  The printer-natural-language-configured attribute contains
       a language tag [BCP47] for these description attributes (for
       example, to support text-to-speech conversions).  
       
   3)  Keyword 
       - printer-compression-supported, printer-finishings-supported,
       printer-media-supported, printer-media-local-supported,
       printer-print-quality-supported 
       
       The UTF-8 encoding is compatible with the current IPP/1.1
       [RFC2911] definition of the equivalent attributes, most of which
       have the IPP/1.1 union syntax 'keyword or name'.  The keyword
       attributes defined in this document are extensible by
       site-specific or vendor-specific 'names' which behave like new
       'keywords' 
       
       Note:  In IPP/1.1, each value is strongly typed over-the-wire as 
       either 'keyword' or 'name'.  This union selector is not preserved
       in the definitions of these equivalent LDAP attributes.  
   
   
   
   1.2.  Rationale for using caseIgnoreMatch
   
   The EQUALITY matching rule 'caseIgnoreMatch' defined in [RFC4517] is 
   specified for several groups of string attributes that are defined in
   this document:  
   
   1)  URI 
       
       These URI attributes specify EQUALITY matching with
       'caseIgnoreMatch' (rather than with 'caseExactMatch') in order to
       conform to the spirit of [STD66], which requires case insensitive
       matching on the host part of a URI versus case sensitive matching
       on the remainder of a URI.  
       
       These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case 
       insensitive equality matching for host names in the
       associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC4524].  
       
       Either equality matching rule choice would be a compromise:  
       a) case sensitive whole URI matching may lead to false negative
       matches and has been shown to be fragile (given deployed client
       applications that 'pretty up' host names displayed and
       transferred in URI); 
       b) case insensitive whole URI matching may lead to false positive
       matches, although it is a dangerous practice to publish URI that
       differ only by case (for example, in the path elements).

   2)  Description 
       
       Case insensitive equality matching is more user-friendly for
       description attributes.  
       
   3)  Keyword 
       
       Case insensitive equality matching is more user-friendly for
       keyword attributes.  
   
   
   
   1.3.  Rationale for using caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
   
   The SUBSTR matching rule 'caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch' defined in
   [RFC4517] is specified for several groups of string attributes that
   are defined in this document:  
   
   1)  URI 
       
       These URI attributes follow existing practice of supporting case 
       insensitive equality matching for host names in the
       associatedDomain attribute defined in [RFC4524].  
       
   2)  Description 
       
       Support for case insensitive substring matching is more
       user-friendly for description attributes.  
       
   3)  Keyword 
       
       Support for case insensitive substring matching is more
       user-friendly for keyword attributes.  



2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  
   
   Schema definitions are provided using LDAP [RFC4510] description
   formats.  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for 
   readability.

3.  Definition of Object Classes

   We define the following LDAP object classes for use with both generic
   printer related information and services specific to SLPv2 [RFC2608],
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], and LPR [RFC1179].  
   
   slpServicePrinter - auxiliary class for SLP registered printers
   printerAbstract - abstract class for all printer classes
   printerService - structural class for printers
   printerServiceAuxClass - auxiliary class for printers
   printerIPP - auxiliary class for IPP printers
   printerLPR - auxiliary class for LPR printers
   
   The following are some examples of how applications may choose to use
   these classes when creating directory entries:  
   
   1)  Use printerService for directory entries containing common
       printer information.  
       
   2)  Use both printerService and slpServicePrinter for directory
       entries containing common printer information for SLP registered
       printers.  
       
   3)  Use printerService, printerLPR and printerIPP for directory
       entries containing common printer information for printers that
       support both LPR and IPP.  
       
   4)  Use printerServiceAuxClass and object classes not defined by this
       document for directory entries containing common printer
       information.  In this example, printerServiceAuxClass is used for
       extending other structural classes defining printer information
       with common printer information defined in this document.  
   
   Refer to Section 4 for definition of attribute types referenced by
   these object classes.  We use attribute names instead of OIDs in
   object class definitions for clarity.  Some attribute names described
   in [RFC2911] have been prefixed with 'printer-' as recommended in
   [RFC2926] and [SLPPRT20].

   This auxiliary class defines Service Location Protocol (SLPv2)
   [RFC2608] specific information.  It should be used with a structural
   class such as printerService.  It may be used to create new or extend
   existing directory entries with SLP 'service:printer' abstract
   service type information as defined in [SLPPRT20].  This object class
   is derived from 'slpService', the parent class for all SLP services,
   defined in [RFC2926].

   This abstract class defines printer information.  It is a base class
   for deriving other printer related classes, such as, but not limited
   to, classes defined in this document.  It defines a common set of
   printer attributes that are not specific to any one type of service,

   This structural class defines printer information.  It is derived
   from class printerAbstract and thus inherits common printer
   attributes.  This class can be used with or without auxiliary classes
   to define printer information.  Auxiliary classes can be used to
   extend the common printer information with protocol, service or
   operating system specific information.  
   
   Note:  When extending other structural classes with auxiliary
   classes, printerService should not be used.

4.  Definition of Attribute Types

   The following attribute types are referenced by the object classes
   defined in Section 3.  
   
   The following attribute types reference syntax OIDs defined in
   Section 3 of [RFC4517] (see Section 5 'Definition of Syntaxes'
   below).  
   
   The following attribute types reference matching rule names (instead
   of OIDs) for clarity (see Section 6 below).  For optional attributes,
   if the printer information is not known, the attribute value should
   not be set.  In the following definitions, referenced matching rules
   are defined in Section 4 of [RFC4517] (see Section 6 'Definition of
   Matching Rules' below).  
   
   The following table is a summary of the attribute names defined by
   this document and their corresponding source document names as
   defined in [RFC2911], [RFC3805], [PWG5107.2], or [IPPJPS3].  Some
   source attribute names have been prefixed with 'printer-' as
   recommended in [RFC2926], to address the flat namespace for LDAP
   identifiers.

   If the printer-xri-supported LDAP attribute is implemented, then this

   Values of URI should conform to [STD66], although URI schemes may be

   Note:  LDAP application clients should not attempt to use malformed
   URI values read from this attribute.  LDAP administrative clients
   should not write malformed URI values into this attribute.  
   
   Note:  This attribute is based on 'printer-uri-supported',
   'uri-authentication-supported', and 'uri-security-supported' (called 
   the 'Three Musketeers' because they are parallel ordered attributes) 
   defined in IPP/1.1 [RFC2911].  This attribute unfolds those IPP/1.1
   attributes and thus avoids the ordering (and same number of values)
   constraints of the IPP/1.1 separate attributes.  
   
   Defined keywords for fields include:  
   
       'uri' (IPP 'printer-uri-supported')
       'auth' (IPP 'uri-authentication-supported')
       'sec' (IPP 'uri-security-supported')
   
   A missing 'auth' field should be interpreted to mean 'none'.  Per
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], defined values of the 'auth' field include:  
   
       'none' (no authentication for this URI)
       'requesting-user-name' (from operation request)
       'basic' (HTTP/1.1 Basic [RFC2617])
       'digest' (HTTP/1.1 Basic, [RFC2617])
       'certificate' (from certificate)
   
   A missing 'sec' field should be interpreted to mean 'none'.  Per
   IPP/1.1 [RFC2911], defined values of the 'sec' field include:  
   
       'none' (no security for this URI)
       'ssl3' (Netscape SSL3)
       'tls' (IETF TLS, [RFC5246])
   
   Each XRI field should be delimited by '<'.  For example:  
   
       'uri=ipp://foo.com< auth=digest< sec=tls<' 
       'uri=lpr://bar.com< auth=none< sec=none<'
       'uri=mailto:printer@foobar.com< auth=none< sec=none<'
   
   Note:  The syntax and delimiter for this attribute are aligned with
   the equivalent attribute in the 'service:printer:' v2.0 template
   [SLPPRT20].  Whitespace is permitted after (but not before) the
   delimiter '<'.  Note that this delimiter differs from
   printer-resolution-supported.

8.  Internationalization Considerations

   All text string attributes defined in this document of syntax
   'DirectoryString' [RFC4517] have values that are encoded in UTF-8
   [STD63], as required by [RFC4517].  
   
   A language tag [BCP47] for all of the text string attributes defined
   in this document is contained in the
   printer-natural-language-configured attribute.  
   
   Therefore, all object classes defined in this document conform to the
   IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages [BCP18].  



9.  Security Considerations

   See [RFC4513] for detailed guidance on authentication methods for
   LDAP and the use of TLS/1.2 [RFC5246] to supply connection
   confidentiality and data integrity for LDAP sessions.  
   
   As with any LDAP schema, it is important to protect specific entries 
   and attributes with the appropriate access control.  It is
   particularly important that only administrators can modify entries
   defined in this LDAP printer schema.  Otherwise, an LDAP client might
   be fooled into diverting print service requests from the original
   printer (or spooler) to a malicious intruder's host system, thus
   exposing the information in printed documents.  
   
   For additional security considerations of deploying printers in an
   IPP environment, see Section 8 of [RFC2911].
