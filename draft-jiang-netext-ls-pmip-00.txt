          Load sharing support for MAGs in Proxy Mobile IPv6

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility
   management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. When the
   numbers of MNs which attaching to the same MAG is very large, it will
   cause the problem that the arrival rate of data traffic is far
   surpass the process capacity of the MAG. So the MAG will suffer from
   process bottleneck. The IETF is working on optimization for PMIPv6.
   This document proposes a load sharing solution for MAGs by migrating
   the Picked Mobile Node (PMN) to some MAGs without overload to sharing
   the traffic load, which can relieve stress of the overloaded MAG and
   improve the performance of PMIPv6 network.

INTERNET DRAFT          Load sharing for PMIPv6        December 29, 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification describes the load sharing support for Mobile
   Access Gateways (MAG) in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213]
   protocol. In PMIPv6, MAG performs the mobility-related signaling on
   behalf of the Mobile Nodes (MN) attached to the access links. A Local
   Mobility Domain (LMD) includes one Local Mobile Anchor (LMA) and
   multiple MAGs. With the number of MNs attaching to the specified MAG
   increasing, the overall traffic flow will surpass the processing
   capacity of the MAG. Thus MN will suffer from delay caused in the
   MAG, which will lower the transmission performance. So supplying the
   load sharing mechanism among MAGs can improve the data transmission
   capability for the PMIPv6 network.

2.  Requirements and Terminology

2.1 Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2 Terminology

   In addition to the terminology defined in [RFC5213], the following
   terminology is also used:

   Picked Mobile Node (PMN) - the MN selected by the scheme to migrate
   from the past MAG to the new MAG. The picking criterion is based on
   the traffic load stemming from the MN with some traffic parameters
   such as arrived rate of the traffic or the traffic pattern.

3.  Load Sharing Strategy

   In PMIPv6 network, the MN migration from the overload MAG to some
   MAGs with low load can realize the load sharing among MAGs. In the
   initial stage, MAG measures the arrival rate of packets V1 from the
   MN. In general the access router is used as the MAG, so the packet
   process capacity V2 can be used to compare with V1. With the
   condition and weighted basis, the overload MAG initiates to perform
   the load sharing. The detailed comparative method can be discussed
   outside of this specification.

   The LMA located in a LMD will setup the bi-tunnel with each MAG. Load
   State Message (LSM) is used to periodically send the load information
   to LMA. The detailed message format is shown in Figure 1. A new flag
   (N) is included in the LSM message to reflect the MN attachment state
   of the MAG. The LSM is designated as MH type 10 in the Mobility

   Header as defined in Mobile IPv6 [RFC 6275]. In order to respond to
   the LSM from MAG, Load Sate Acknowledgement Message (LSAM) is
   utilized to send optional MAGs message to MAG for migrating the new
   arrival MN. The message format is presented in Figure 2.

   According to the received load statement of those connected MAGs, LMA
   constructs an optional MN allocation set for the load sharing among
   MAGs. Based on MN attachment statement of the MN allocation set, LMA
   sends the LSAM to the MAG with the heaviest load.

   For the new arrival MNs, MAG compares the V1 with V2 and chooses the
   requirements of the MN with higher transmission rate as PMN. With
   this condition, the criterion generally depends on the service type
   of the MN. MN operating traditional Internet application such as text
   and web service with low delay requirements and packet loss can be
   selected as PMN.

   (a)According to the accessing message and the service type, the MN is
   picked as PMN. The overloaded MAG actives the load sharing process
   and sends LSM to LMA.

   (b)LMA gives a feedback with the load information of a MAG set with
   MAGs in the same LMD with the overload MAG and no overload.

   (c)The overload MAG sends handover request to one step MAGs.

   (d)Those MAGs give feedback with load information.

   (e)According to the comparing, the overload MAG selects the alternate
   MAG to migrate the PMN and sends information of PMN to the alternate

   MAG.

   (f)The overload MAG sends the message with the alternate MAG
   information to PMN to activate the migration.

   (g)PMN sends the Router Solicitation to the alternate MAG. 

   (h)After the access authentication, the alternate MAG sends the PBU
   message to LMA.

   (i)LMA gives a PBA message to respond MAG.

   (j)The MAG sends a Router Advertisement with home network prefix to
   PMN. Through the bi-tunnel between PMN and alternate MAG, the new
   data transmission can be setup.
