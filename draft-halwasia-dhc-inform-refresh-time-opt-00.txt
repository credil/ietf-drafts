                   DHCPv4 INFORM Refresh Time Option
             draft-halwasia-dhc-inform-refresh-time-opt-00

Abstract

   This document describes a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
   IPv4 (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] option for specifying an upper bound for how
   long a client should wait before refreshing information retrieved
   from DHCPv4 Server by using DHCP INFORM message.  It is used with
   stateless DHCPv4 as there are no addresses or other entities with
   lifetimes that can tell the client when to contact the DHCPv4 server
   to refresh its configuration.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft      DHCPv4 INFORM Refresh Time Option     September 2012


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv4 [RFC2131] specifies DHCP INFORM message which a client can
   sent to obtain other local configuration parameters in case client
   has obtained a network address through some other means.  This other
   configuration data will typically have no associated "lease", hence
   there may be no information telling a host when to refresh its
   configuration data.  Therefore, an option that can be used from
   server to client to inform the client when it should refresh the
   other configuration data is needed.

   This option is useful in many situations:-

   - Unstable environments where unexpected changes are likely to occur.

   - For planned changes, including renumbering.  An administrator can
   gradually decrease the time as the event nears.

   - Use cases described in [I-D.bhandari-netext-pmipv6-dhcp-options]
   also intends to use this option to exchange configuration parameters
   in between MAG and LMA.


2.  DHCPv4 INFORM Refresh Time Option

   The INFORM refresh time option specifies an upper bound for how long
   a client should wait before refreshing configuration parameters
   retrieved from DHCPv4.  It is only used in DHCP ACK messages in
   response to DHCP INFORM messages.  In other messages there will
   usually be other options that indicate when the client should contact
   the server.  Note that it is only an upper bound.  If the client has
   any reason to send DHCP INFORM before the refresh time expires, it
   should attempt to refresh all the configuration parameters.  A client
   may contact the server before the refresh time expires due to various
   reasons.  For example, it may need additional configuration
   parameters (such as by an application), or that it has an indication
   that it may have moved to a new link etc.  The expiry of the refresh
   time in itself does not in any way mean that the client should remove
   the data.  The client should keep its current data while attempting
   to refresh it.  When a client receives a ACK message to an INFORM
   message that contains configuration information, it should install
   that new configuration information after removing any previously
   received configuration information.  It should also remove
   information that is missing from the new information set, e.g., an
   option might be left out or contain only a subset of what it did
   previously.

     The format of the DHCPv4 INFORM Refresh Time Option option is shown
     below.

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |     option-value(cont.)       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         option-code:  8-bit option code
         option-len:   4
         option-value: Time duration relative to the current time,
                       expressed in units of seconds


3.  Client Behaviour

   A client MUST request this option in the Parameter Request List
   Option when sending Parameter Request List message to the DHCPv4
   server.  A client MUST NOT request this option in the Parameter
   Request List option in any other messages.  This document recommends
   default refresh time of 86400 seconds and minimum default refresh
   time of 600 seconds.  If the Reply to an INFORM message does not
   contain this option, the client MUST behave as if the option with
   value 86400 seconds (24 hrs) was provided.  A client MUST use the
   refresh time of 600 seconds if it receives the option with a value
   less than 600 seconds.

   The value 0xffffffff in this option implies that the client should
   not refresh its configuration data without some other trigger (such
   as detecting movement to a new link).  If a client contacts the
   server to obtain new data or refresh some existing data before the
   refresh time expires, then it SHOULD also refresh all data covered by
   this option.  When the client detects that the refresh time has
   expired, it SHOULD try to update its configuration data by sending an
   INFORM message as specified in section 4.4.3 of [RFC2131].  A client
   MAY have a maximum value for the refresh time, where that value is
   used whenever the client receives this option with a value higher
   than the maximum.  This also means that the maximum value is used
   when the received value is "0xffffffff".  A maximum value might make
   the client less vulnerable to attacks based on forged DHCP messages.
   Without a maximum value, a client may be made to use wrong
   information for a possibly infinite period of time.  There may
   however be reasons for having a very long refresh time, so it may be
   useful for this maximum value to be configurable.

4.  Server Behaviour

   A server sending a ACK message to an INFORM message SHOULD include
   this option if it is requested in the Parameter Request List Option
   of the INFORM message.  The option value MUST NOT be smaller than 600
   seconds.  The server SHOULD give a warning if it is configured with a
   smaller value.  The option MUST only appear in the ACK messages.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines DHCPv4 INFORM Refresh Time Option which
   requires assignment of DHCPv4 option code TBD1 assigned from "Bootp
   and DHCP options" registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/ bootp-
   dhcp-parameters/bootp-dhcp-parameters.xml), as specified in
   [RFC2939].


6.  Security Considerations

   Section 7 of [RFC2131] outlines the DHCPv4 security considerations.
   This option does not change these in any significant way.  An
   attacker could send faked ACK messages with a low INFORM refresh time
   value, which would trigger use of minimum recommended value of 600
   seconds to minimize this threat.  Another attack might be to send a
   very large value, to make the client use forged information for a
   long period of time.  A possible maximum limit at the client is
   suggested, which would reduce this problem.
