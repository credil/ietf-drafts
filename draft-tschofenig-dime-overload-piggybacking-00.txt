1.  Introduction

   The problem statement for Diameter overload control can be found in
   [3].  It describes the lack of support of conveying load information
   to enable load balancing of Diameter requests in case Diameter
   servers become overload and the inability of Diameter servers to
   communicate with Diameter clients to reject requests when they become
   severely overloaded. [5] goes a step further in providing an outline
   of architectural principles and an information model.

   This document is an extension to [5] and defines how Diameter servers
   interact with Diameter clients to report about overload situations.
   This is accomplished by piggybacking overload information from the
   Diameter server to the Diameter client within existing Diameter
   applications, as long as extension points allow adding new AVPs.

   Communication overload information to Diameter clients is the last
   resource when load balancing is either not available, when all
   available servers are already overloaded, or when a critical failure
   occurred since this will lead to the Diameter client rejecting
   requests and returning appropriate error messages to end devices via
   the front-end protocols (such as SIP).

2.  Terminology

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document re-uses terminology from the Diameter base
   specification [2].

3.  Information Exchanges

3.1.  Capability Indication

   The Diameter protocol interaction starts with a Diameter client using
   some Diameter application.  The Diameter client MUST add the
   Supported-Features AVP to indicate support for the functionality
   supported for overload control.  The Supported-Features AVP MUST NOT
   have the M-bit set since this would require a Diameter application to
   be defined.

   A Diameter server receiving the Supported-Features AVP from a client
   is therefore able to know that this client supports the Diameter
   overload information exchange capability.  Otherwise only the
   Diameter Base protocol functionality [2] with DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY error
   message is available.  This enables feature discovery and a graceful
   fall-back to the functionality available with the Diameter Base
   protocol

3.2.  Overload Information

   In the rare and unlikely event of an overload situation the Diameter
   server (or a proxy, such as a load balancer, acting on behalf of
   several Diameter servers) may decide to communicate to the Diameter
   client to reject some or even all Diameter requests.  The Diameter
   server does so by adding the Overload-Info AVP, which contains the
   Overload and the Period-Of-Validity AVP.  The semantic of the
   Overload and the Period-Of-Validity AVP is described in [5].  To
   inform the Diameter client to reject requests the value of the
   Overload AVP is set to 'INCREASING_OVERLOAD' or to 'OVERLOADED'.  The
   Diameter server may instruct the client to gradually reduce the
   number of requests by using the Overload='INCREASING_OVERLOAD'
   marking on several subsequent messages.  The Period-Of-Validity AVP
   allows the Diameter server to give the "rejection policy" a soft-
   state nature, i.e., it will automatically expire without leaving
   orphan state at the Diameter client in case of a Diameter server
   failure or other error situations.

   A Diameter client that has received information to reduce the number
   of Diameter requests has to evaluate the requests based on their
   destination and their applications.

   In case the Diameter server recovers and is able to accept more
   Diameter requests it can signal this changed state to the client with
   the 'DECREASING_OVERLOAD' or the 'NO_OVERLOAD' directive.  Waiting
   for the expiry of the state is another option at the disposal of the
   Diameter server.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document utilizes the AVP defined in [5].  The ability to use
   end-to-end signaling allows the Diameter AVP level security
   mechanisms, described in [4], to be re-used.  Since the communicated
   rejection policies are bound to the application and the realm from an
   earlier request the ability to inject fake message is less likely.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.
