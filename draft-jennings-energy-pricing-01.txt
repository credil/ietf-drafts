               Communication of Energy Price Information
                    draft-jennings-energy-pricing-01

Abstract

   This specification defines media types for representing the future
   price of energy in JSON.  It also defines a way for a client device,
   such as a car, refrigerator, air conditioner, water heater, or
   display to discover a web server that can provide the future price
   for local electrical energy.  This will allow the client device to
   make intelligent decisions about when to use energy, and enable price
   distribution when the building is off-grid.  It enables obtaining
   price from a local or non-local price server.

   This draft is an early skeleton of a draft to start discussion around
   this idea.

1.  Overview

   Many uses of energy can be shifted in time, or changed in quantity,
   based on price.  Consider charging an electric car.  For users that
   plug in cars at 9pm, they may not care when it actually charges, as
   long as it is ready at 8am when they need to go to work.  This is a
   classic real time problem and can be optimized as long as the charger
   for the car has relevant information about how long it will take to
   charge and the cost of electricity between the current time and the
   time when the task needs to be complete.

   Other devices such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and washers
   can similarly shift load.  For their primary temperature regulation
   function, they can lower their setpoint (for cooling devices) when
   costs are low, and increase it when costs are high.  The amount of
   deviation from the base target is keyed to the value of the price,
   operational considerations (e.g. not letting food freeze or spoil),
   or other non-price information available (e.g. occupancy).  Devices
   such as displays (TV or computer) or lights can dim in some
   proportion to the electricity price, to balance cost and
   functionality.  Devices with user-oriented time-outs (e.g. when an
   occupancy sensor's lack of seeing anyone in a space leads to a light
   going off) can adjust the length of such time-outs in proportion to
   price.  Periodic functions (e.g. a refrigerator defrost cycle) can be
   shifted to the lowest cost time in the relevant time horizon.  In
   general, the end-use device itself usually has the most knowledge
   about how best to act, and the the best access to internal actuators
   to accomplish the change.

   Development around "Demand Response (DR)" has been advancing since
   around 2000.  Most work in that area involves sending signals from
   the grid (DR-service provider) to a large building (commercial/
   industrial) or large device within it, to request load shedding or
   load shifting.  There are then financial arrangements to pay the
   building owner for the service.  More recently, the DR community and
   regulators have turned to enabling dynamic pricing so that the price
   customers actually pay at the meter more closely corresponds to the
   actual costs that the utility faces.  Prices can be sent from the

   grid to an end use device, or from the grid to a gateway device
   (could be the meter) that then sends the prices to end use devices.

   This specification defines a simple JSON[RFC4627]media type to
   provide the cost of energy at future points of time.  It is an array
   of objects in which each object contains the time a new price will
   come into effect and the price at that time.  JSON also defines a
   well known URL on a web server so that an HTTP client can retrieve
   this data.  Finally as a way to automatically discover the web
   server, this specification defines a DHCP option to provide the host
   name of the web server.

   At this time, only electricity is contemplated, but other resources
   do plausibly have time-varying prices, such as centrally provided
   steam or hot/cold water.  Any resource (e.g. water) could use this
   mechanism to have a local price to distribute.  Resources with a
   local supply constraint will then have a local price to ensure a
   balance with demand.

   The base usage case for this specification is a time-varying
   electricity price with the current price and a set of future prices
   (confirmed or estimates), usually for a 24 hour period.  This price
   comes from the electric utility.  The price can be fetched directly
   from the utility.  However, many alternate cases are also expected
   and supported.  The building may have one entity (likely a piece of
   network equipment since it is always on already) that gets prices
   from the grid and all others get it from this building-local 'price
   server'.  Both transactions use this mechanism.

   The operator of the building may choose to present a higher price to
   devices in the building to take into account carbon emissions or
   other pollution from generating electricity.  The building may also
   have local generation and/or storage, whose state and operation may
   indicate changes in price.  For example, a building with an excess of
   solar power on-site may sell marginal electricity back to the grid at
   a low price.  This would suggest lowering the price until supply and
   demand in the building were approximately in balance.

   Some buildings operate off-grid, either all the time or
   intermittently.  A building is a structure that uses resources and
   provides services.  Common examples are homes, office, retail, and
   institutional buildings.  Other building types include vehicles such
   as cars, ships, and airplanes.  All these building types have
   electricity systems that would benefit from a price mechanism.

   There are other protocols designed to get prices from the grid to a
   building, particularly to a building control system.  One example of
   these is OpenADR.  This mechanism complements rather than replaces

Internet-Draft               Energy Pricing                    July 2011


   these other mechanisms.

   Electricity pricing has other aspects that complicate pricing.  For
   example, in many places electricity use over a monthly billing period
   is sold in blocks, with the price increasing or decreasing with
   larger blocks depending on what the utility is trying to accomplish
   with the price.  For example, the first five hundred kWh could be
   $0.10/kWh, the second 500 kWh $0.15, and so on.  Thus, the monthly
   marginal price (what is paid if the consumption goes up or down
   modestly) is the last block used.  This could be substantially
   different from an average price.  There are many options for how
   utilities could combine blocks with dynamic prices.  This
   specification is not attempting to provide a set of prices that are
   legally binding.  Rather, it is intended to provide a simple and
   reasonably reliable set of prices that devices can use (when the
   alternative may be in fact no information at all).

   Consider a typical residence with broadband Internet and a
   residential gateway that gets its IP address via DHCP from the
   service provider.  The service provider would provide the domain of
   the local power provider via DHCP.  The residential gateway would get
   this and provide it in DHCP requests sent to the residential gateway.
   The residential gateway would also be able to override this, so if
   the consumer had arranged power from an alternative power provider,
   the name of that provider could be configured in the device.

   A device on the residential network, such as a dishwasher, could find
   the energy provider name via DHCP.  The dishwasher would then make an
   HTTP GET request to the well known URI defined in this specification.
   In other words, it would do an HTTP GET to the /.well_known/
   electricity-price.json and would receive back an energyprice+json
   media type.  For example

   {
   "currency" : "USD",
   "prices":[
       { "time": "2011-04-12T23:20:00.00Z", "price": "0.028" },
       { "time": "2011-04-12T23:21:00.00Z", "price": "0.025" },
       { "time": "2011-04-12T23:22:00.00Z", "price": "0.021" }
   ]}

   The above example shows a case where at 21:00 UTC, the price falls
   from 2.8 cents per KWh to 2.5 cents per kWh.  Using kWh is fixed.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",



Jennings & Nordman      Expires January 11, 2012                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               Energy Pricing                    July 2011


   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Semantics

   Each media type carries a single JSON object that represents a set of
   prices and times.  This object contains optional attributes described
   below and a mandatory array of one or more measurements.

   validTill:  Time at which this data series will become invalid.  UTC
      time in RFC 3339 format.
   currency:  Optional.  Specify currency in ISO 4217 [REF] currency
      code.
   prices:  Array of price objects.  Mandatory and there must be at
      least one object in the array.  Objects MUST be ordered in this
      array by time.

   Each price time object contains several attributes, some of which are
   optional and some of which are mandatory.

   time:  Time this price becomes effective.  UTC time in RFC 3339
      format.
   price:  Price per kWh.  The cost of energy changes to this price at
      the time in this object and remains at this price until the time
      of the next object in the prices array.

   Open Issue:  What is the best representation for time?

   Open Issue:  Is it OK that currency is optional?

   Open Issue:  How many entries can the array have?  It would be nice
   to have some maximum size.

   The price in the last entry in the series is ignored.  That is, the
   purpose of the last entry is to close the time of the last period.
   While 24 hours will be a typical time horizon, it could be shorter or
   longer.

   Question:  Can the request have a start time (zero for the present),
   so that if there is a limit on array size, one can get the rest?

   Open Issue:  should we be able to represent both buy and sell prices?


4.  Well Known URL

   A client that implements this specification uses the path "//.well-

   known/electricity-price.json" for the resource name unless the client
   has been configured with an alternative path.


5.  DHCP

   Open Issues:  Is DHCP the best approach to discovery or would
   something else be better?


6.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor:  Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA"
   with the RFC number of this specification.

6.1.  Well-Known URI Registration

   IANA will make the following "Well Known URI" registration as
   described in RFC 5785:

          +----------------------------+------------------------+
          | URI suffix:                | electricity-price.json |
          | Change controller:         | IETF <iesg@ietf.org>   |
          | Specification document(s): | [RFC-AAAA]             |
          | Related information:       | None                   |
          +----------------------------+------------------------+

6.2.  DHCP Options

   TBD

6.3.  Media Type Registration

   The following registrations are done following the procedure
   specified in [RFC4288] and [RFC3023].

   Note to RFC Editor:  Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA"
   with the RFC number of this specification.

7.  Mapping to OpenADR

   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory led the development of OpenADR
   initially (OpenADR v1.0), and it is now being formalized as an open

   standard through OASIS and national Smart Grid activity (OpenADR
   v2.0).  At present, there are two relevant OASIS technical committees
   (TCs) that are relevant to the dynamic pricing (includes real-time
   prices) discussion:  the Energy Interoperation TC (EI) and the Energy
   Market Information Exchange TC (EMIX).  Each committee has a draft
   standard of the same name as the technical committee.

   The OpenADR v2.0 standard will become a subset of what EI produces.
   EMIX is charged with defining a standard abstract form of price
   signaling.  The details of how to represent a price product is
   defined in EMIX[EMIX] (then EI[EI] would reference and build
   implementation models, for e.g., XML schemas).

   Both committees cover much more than just price (and price forecast)
   information.  The discussion below focuses only on features relevant
   to this IETF specification.  The OpenADR model uses XML as the data
   description language.  OpenADR v1.0 and v2.0 can specify prices in
   different terms - absolute, multiple, or in relative terms to a base
   price (either additive or multiplicative).

   Pricing can be a very complicated topic, but for the discussion here,
   we limit it to what this specification does- a schedule of time
   periods and a price for each period.

   To represent time, EI and EMIX use WS-Calendar (also an OASIS
   standard), which provides for complex scheduling; simple price
   sequences use only a small part of this.  Sequences are represented
   as a start time and a sequence of interval durations.  As WS-Calendar
   builds on iCalendar (see RFC 5545) it uses the same date/time format
   as this draft.

   A related issue is how to specify the current time to assure that the
   price source and user of the price have consistent time (or know how
   to adjust the schedule for a difference in time).  This discussion
   does not consider this topic.  So long as prices do not vary
   significantly from one time period to the next, and the time
   differences are not large, this issue is not of great concern.

   EMIX can encode prices in several ways, including relative prices.
   For absolute prices, the price is simply a numeric value in cents/kWh
   for the U.S. Other additional attributes relevant to price
   representations are under consideration (e.g., currency).  The
   following is a sample excerpt of an OpenADR v1.0 price schedule:
