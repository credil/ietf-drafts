Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Dec 2011


1.  Introduction

   Cyber attacks are getting more sophisticated, and their numbers are
   increasing day by day.  To cope with such situation, incident
   information needs to be reported, exchanged, and shared among
   organizations.  IODEF is one of the tools enabling such exchange, and
   is already in use.

   To efficiently run cybersecurity operations, these exchanged
   information needs to be machine-readable.  IODEF provides a
   structured means to describe the information, but it needs to embed
   various non-structured such information in order to convey detailed
   information.  Further structure within IODEF increases IODEF
   documents' machine-readability and thus facilitates streamlining
   cybersecurity operations.

   On the other hand, there exist various other activities facilitating
   detailed and structured description of cybersecurity information,
   major of which includes CAPEC [CAPEC], CEE [CEE], CPE [CPE], CVE
   [CVE], CVRF [CVRF], CVSS [CVSS], CWE [CWE], CWSS [CWSS], OCIL [OCIL],
   OVAL [OVAL], and XCCDF [XCCDF].  Since such structured description
   facilitates cybersecurity operations, it would be beneficial to embed
   and convey these information inside IODEF document.

   To enable that, this document extends the IODEF to embed and convey
   various structured cybersecurity information, with which
   cybersecurity operations can be facilitated.  Since IODEF defines a
   flexible and extensible format and supports a granular level of
   specificity, this document defines an extension to IODEF instead of
   defining a new report format.  For clarity, and to eliminate
   duplication, only the additional structures necessary for describing
   the exchange of such structured information are provided.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document follows the one defined in RFC
   5070 [RFC5070].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   To maintain cybersecurity, organization needs to exchange
   cybersecurity information, which includes the following information:



Takahashi, et al.         Expires June 30, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Dec 2011


   attack pattern, platform information, vulnerability and weakness,
   countermeasure instruction, computer event log, and the severity.

   IODEF provides a scheme to exchange such information among interested
   parties.  However, the detailed common format to describe such
   information is not defined in the IODEF base document.

   On the other hand, to describe those information and to facilitate
   exchange, a structured format for that is already available.  Major
   of them are CAPEC, CEE, CPE, CVE, CVRF, CVSS, CWE, CWSS, OCIL, OVAL,
   and XCCDF.  By embedding them into the IODEF document, the document
   can convey more detailed contents to the receivers, and the document
   can be easily reused.  Note that interactive communication is needed
   in some cases, and some of these structured informatio nsuch as OCIL
   solicits reply from recipients.  These reply could be also embedded
   inside the IODEF document.

   These structured cybersecurity information facilitates cybersecurity
   operation at the receiver side.  Since the information is machine-
   readable, the data can be processed by computers.  That expedites the
   automation of cybersecurity operations

   For instance, an organization wishing to report a security incident
   wants to describe what vulnerability was exploited.  Then the sender
   can simply use IODEF, where an CAPEC record is embedded instead of
   describing everything in free format text.  Receiver can also
   identify the needed details of the attack pattern by looking up some
   of the xml [XML1.0] tags defined by CAPEC.  Receiver can accumulate
   the attack pattern information (CAPEC record) in its database and
   could distribute it to the interested parties if needed, without
   needing human interventions.


4.  Extension Definition

   This draft extends IODEF to embed structured cybersecurity
   information by introducing new classes, with which these information
   can be embedded inside IODEF document as element contents of
   AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.

4.1.  IDs for Structured Cybersecurity Information Specifictions

   This extension embeds structured cybersecurity information from
   external specifications.  The initial list of supported
   specifications is in Figure 1 below, followed by a subsection for
   each specification that lists the ID, specification name, version,
   namespace [XMLNames], specification URI and applicable classes for
   each specification.  Future assignments are to be managed by IANA

   +------------------------+

                       Figure 3: AttackPattern class

   This class has the following attributes.

   Version:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The version number of the extension
      specification to which this class conforms.  This value should be
      1.00, to be compliant with this document.  Its default value is
      1.00.

   SpecificationID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The ID of the specification and
      its version specifying the format of the RawData element.  The
      value should be chosen from the IDs listed in Figure 1, such as
      CAPEC_1.6.  Note that the lists in Figure 1 will be developed
      further by IANA.

   AttackPatternID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An ID of an attack pattern to
      be reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such ID is
      available.  In case a RawData or Reference element is provided
      along with this attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this
      ID is consistent with the one provided by the element; if a
      reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the
      value of this attribute, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a
      human can correct the problem.  Note that this attribute could be
      omitted if no such ID is available.  In this case, either RawData
      or Reference elements, or both of them, MUST be provided.

   The AttackPattern class is composed of the following aggregate
   classes.

   RawData:  Zero or more. xml.  A complete document that is formatted
      according to the specification and its version identified by the
      value of the SpecificationID with the Figure 1.

   Reference:  Zero or more of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  This element
      allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured
      information instead of directly embedding it into a RawData
      element.

      case, this PlatformID element SHOULD NOT be used.  If a reader/
      receiver detects the identifiers in both RawData and PlatformID
      elements and their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the identifiers
      derived from the PlatformID element, and SHOULD log the
      inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

   Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and version
   identified by the SpecificationID are consistent with the contents of
   the RawData; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.2.2.  PlatformID

   VulnerabilityID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An ID of a vulnerability to be
      reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such ID is
      available.  In case a RawData or Reference element is provided
      along with this attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this
      ID is consistent with the one provided by the element; if a
      reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the
      value of this attribute, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a
      human can correct the problem.  Note that this attribute could be
      omitted if no such ID is available.  In this case, either RawData
      or Reference elements, or both of them, MUST be provided.

   This class is composed of the following aggregate classes.

   RawData:  Zero or one. xml.  A complete document that is formatted
      according to the specification and its version identified by the
      value of the SpecificationID with the Figure 1.

   Reference:  Zero or one of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  This element

      information instead of directly embedding it into a RawData
      element.

   PlatformID:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform
      affected by the vulnerability, which is elaborated in
      Section 4.2.2.  Some of the structured information embedded in the
      RawData element may include the identifier within it.  In this
      case, this PlatformID element SHOULD NOT be used.  If a reader/
      receiver detects the identifiers in both RawData and PlatformID
      elements and their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the identifiers
      derived from the PlatformID element, and SHOULD log the
      inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

   Scoring:  Zero or more.  An indicator of the severity of the
      vulnerability, such as CVSS and CCSS scores, which is elaborated
      in Section 4.2.4.  Some of the structured information may include
      scores within it.  In this case, the Scoring element SHOULD NOT be
      used since the RawData element contains the scores.  If a reader/
      receiver detects scores in both RawData and Scoring elements and
      their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the scores derived from the
      RawData element, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances
   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,
   the underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure
   the appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity for the specific environment.

   Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
   develop operating procedures that document the following areas of
   concern.

6.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns

   The underlying messaging format and protocol used to exchange
   instances of the IODEF MUST provide appropriate guarantees of
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  The use of a
   standardized security protocol is encouraged.  The Real-time Inter-
   network Defense (RID) protocol [RFC6045] and its associated transport
   binding [RFC6046] provide such security.

   The critical security concerns are that these structured information
   may be falsified or they may become corrupt during transit.  In areas
   where transmission security or secrecy is questionable, the
   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns.  We expect that each
   exchanging organization will determine the need, and mechanism, for
   transport protection.

6.2.  Using the iodef:restriction Attribute

   In some instances, data values in particular elements may contain
   data deemed sensitive by the reporter.  Although there are no
   general-purpose rules on when to mark certain values as "private" or
   "need-to-know" via the iodef:restriction attribute, the reporter is
   cautioned not to apply element-level sensitivity markings unless they

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Dec 2011


   believe the receiving party (i.e., the party they are exchanging the
   event report data with) has a mechanism to adequately safeguard and
   process the data as marked.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML
   schemata[XMLschemaPart1][XMLschemaPart2] conforming to a registry
   mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the IODEF structured cybersecurity
   information extension namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-sci-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

      XML: None

   Registration request for the IODEF structured cybersecurity
   information extension XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-sci-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

      XML: Refer here to the XML Schema in the appendix of the document.

   This memo creates the following registry for IANA to manage:

      Name of the registry: "IODEF Structured Cyber Security Information
      Specifications"

      Namespace details: A registry entry for a Structured Cyber
      Security Information Specification (SCI specification) consists
      of:

         ID: A short XSD string that is used in the SpecificationID
         attribute of an IODEF extended class defined in this memo.  The
         ID is usually based on the acronym and version number of the
         SCI specification.

         Specification Name: A string containing the spelled-out name of
         the SCI specification in human-readable form.

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Dec 2011


         Version: The version of the registered SCI specification.  This
         is a string that SHOULD consist of numbers separated by '.'
         (period) characters, but additional characters and different
         formatting MAY be used when appropriate.

         Namespace: A URI [RFC3986] that is the XML namespace name used
         by the registered SCI specification.

         Specification URI: A URI [RFC3986] from which the registered
         specification can be obtained.  The registered specification
         MUST be readily and publicly available from that URI.

         Applicable Classes: A list of one or more of the Extended
         Classes specified in Section 4.2 of this document.  The
         registered SCI specification MUST only be used with the
         Extended Classes in the registry entry.

      Information that must be provided to assign a new value: The above
      list of information.

      Assignment policy: If the requested value is not already assigned,
      it may be assigned to the requester.

      Fields to record in the registry: ID/Specification Name/Version/
      Namespace/Applicable Classes.

      Initial registry contents: See sections from Section 4.1.1 through
      Section 4.1.16 above.

      Allocation Policy: Expert Review [RFC5226] and Specification
      Required [RFC5226].

   The Designated Expert is expected to consult with the mile (Managed
   Incident Lightweight Exchange) working group or its successor if any
   such WG exists (e.g., via email to the working group's mailing list).
   The Designated Expert is expected to retrieve the SCI specification
   from the provided URI in order to check the public availability of
   the specification and verify the correctness of the URI.  An
   important responsibility of the Designated Expert is to ensure that
   the registered Applicable Classes are appropriate for the registered
   SCI specification.
