 Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Metadata Interface
                       draft-ma-cdni-metadata-02

Abstract

   Content publishers (CPs) often use multiple Content Delivery Networks
   (CDNs) to deliver content to consumers.  Though existing interactions
   between CPs and individual CDNs are beyond the scope of CDN
   interconnection (CDNI), it is important to understand the management
   capabilities and features available with existing non-interconnected
   multi-CDN deployments.  Before migrating to CDNI, CPs must first
   assess the suitability of CDNI as a replacement for their existing
   non-interconnected multi-CDN deployments.  CDN feature configuration
   and capability advertisement and enforcement is likely to occur
   through the CDNI metadata interface (MI).  This document describes an
   approach to implementing the CDNI MI through the use of an extensible
   metadata model and a light-weight HTTP-based API.

1.  Introduction

   The use cases described in the CDNI use case document
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases] provide motivational use cases for CDN
   interconnection (CDNI).  They describe reasons and situations where
   CDNI provides a benefit to CDN vendors as well as content service
   providers (CSPs).  Additional use cases exist which describe how CDNs
   are used today, however, these use cases often involve specific
   features (e.g., customized content transformations, content security,
   client authentication and filtering, content acquisition optimization
   and redundancy, etc.) which are beyond the scope of CDNI.  Though the
   features themselves are not relevant to CDNI, the ability to support
   those features or enforce policies related to those features in a
   generic and extensible manner should be considered when designing
   CDNI interfaces.  The ability to support feature parity with existing
   deployment models (i.e., non-CDNI-based CDN federation) may help to
   remove barriers to CDNI adoption.

   Though certain interfaces are out of scope of CDNI, e.g.:

   o  upstream CDN (uCDN) configuration by the CP

   o  uCDN content acquisition

   o  uCDN content delivery

   o  downstream CDN (dCDN) content acquisition

   o  end user (EU) content acquisition

   o  third party workflow management

   o  third party request routing

   An awareness of these interfaces and an understanding of the
   restrictions which they may impose on CDNI request routing is useful
   for understanding the needs of the CDNI metadata interface (MI).  As
   described in the "Dynamic CDNI Metadata Acquisition Example" section
   in the CDNI framework document [I-D.davie-cdni-framework], upon
   receiving a request routing interface (RRI) request, the MI MAY be
   used to retrieve metadata that is "considered" before responding to
   the RRI request.  To that end, the MI MUST define a deterministic
   method for handling metadata processing.  Though the definition and
   interpretation of any individual piece of metadata is beyond the
   scope of CDNI, a well-defined method for how to respond to a RRI
   request when any unknown metadata value is encountered MUST be
   supported.

Internet-Draft                CDNI Metadata                   April 2012


   This document describes a simple data model for representing CDNI
   metadata and a simple protocol for creating and retrieving CDNI
   metadata in an opaque manner.  The term opaque, in this case, should
   be understood to mean: without understanding the underlying meaning
   or interpretation of the metadata being represented.  The metadata
   model and retrieval protocol SHOULD be completely independent of the
   definition of individual metadata values.  The metadata model and
   retrieval protocol MUST also define default behaviors for dealing
   with metadata processing errors.  The document defines a list of
   metadata which are likely applicable to a broad range of CDNI
   deployments.  The document also provides a separate list of metadata
   which are likely to be desirable to content publishers (CPs).  This
   document is not intended to suggest that any additional interfaces or
   requirements are needed beyond those already specified in the CDNI
   requirements document [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements], nor is this
   document intended to suggest that any out of scope interfaces or
   content publisher feature functionality should be brought into scope.
   The metadata examples provided are intended only to illustrate
   possible features that interconnected CDNs may wish to support and
   the extensibility of the metadata model to handle those situations.

2.  CDNI Metadata Data Model

   The simple data model is shown in Figure 1 below.  It includes a top
   level Domain object which describes the site(s) to which metadata is
   associated.  The term site, in this case, should be understood to
   mean a collection of related content assets accessed through a single
   portal or Web-site.  The Domain is associated with zero or more
   opaque Metadata objects.  Each Metadata object is associated with one
   or more Base Address objects.  The Metadata objects are each
   associated with a URI extension, applicable to any of the associated
   Base Addresses.  A combination of Base Address and URI prefix
   matching is used identify Metadata to allow for hierarchical
   associations between individual Metadata and sets of content items.
   Each Domain is also associated with one or more Agent objects.
   Agents represent entities which require access to metadata (e.g.,
   CPs, uCDNs, dCDNs, or local operators).  An Agent is associated with
   each Metadata entry allowing different Metadata values to be returned
   to different Agents.

   Note: The data model described above provides the basic components
   required for distributing Metadata and implementing the CDNI MI.  The
   specific semantics of individual pieces of metadata are abstracted to
   allow for opaque distribution of metadata.  Not all of the
   information described need be distributed through the MI.  Some
   information (e.g., Domains and Agents) may be necessary for the MI to
   function, but MAY be negotiated or implemented out-of-band.  They
   could be configured either by the CDN as part of a non-CDNI process,
   or through the CDNI control interface (CI) bootstrapping process, or
   using the MI APIs described herein.  The MI APIs may also be used by

   CDNs, internally, to configure themselves.  The complete data model
   and full set of APIs are provided as part of a holistic MI
   description.

   The following sections describe an example implementation of the
   metadata scheme described above using a standard SQL database.

2.1.  Domain Table

   The Domain object contains basic information related to the site
   being described.  The example shown contains a primary key index and
   a unique name for the site.  An OPTIONAL site description (e.g., a
   textual description of the site and its content) and site provider
   (e.g., the name of the CP or CSP which owns the content) information
   is also included.

   CREATE TABLE "domain" ("domain_id" serial primary key,
                          "name" character varying(255) NOT NULL,
                          "provider" character varying(255),
                          "description" character varying(4095));
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_domain ON domain (name);

   The Domain is the central object for binding Metadata.  The example
   Domain shown below highlights the descriptive nature of the Domain
   object:

      domain_id: 1
      name: acme
      provider: acme rocket-powered products, inc
      description: fine purveyors of high quality anvils, rubber bands,
                   bird seed, and rocket-powered footwear.

2.2.  Base Address Table

   The Base Address object contains basic hostname and base URI
   information related to the site being accessed.  The example shown
   requires a primary key index, a string containing the hostname and
   base URI, and a foreign key reference to the Metadata to which this
   Base Address is associated.  A uniqueness constraint is imposed on
   baseaddr/metadata_id pairs to prevent duplicate Base Address entries
   for a given Metadata.

   CREATE TABLE "baseaddr" ("baseaddr_id" serial primary key,
                            "baseaddr" character varying(255) NOT NULL,
                            "metadata_id" integer NOT NULL);
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_baseaddr ON baseaddr (baseaddr,
                                                   metadata_id);

                       Base Address Table Definition

   The Base Address objects allows multiple hostname and base URI pairs
   to be associated with each Metadata object denoting the list of Base
   Addresses through which content within the Domain may be accessed.
   There are many cases where different Base Addresses are used to
   access the same content, e.g.:

   o  internal vs. external addresses: content may be accessible via
      both internal 10-net IP addresses and their associated DNS
      addresses and base URIs, as well as publicly routable external IP
      addresses and their associated DNS addresses and base URIs, where
      all of the addresses point to the same content servers and the
      base URIs are mapped to the same base directories,

   o  service white-labeling: multiple CSPs may provide access to the
      same content through different branded services where each branded
      service has its own DNS address and/or base URI, but all of the
      services point to the same content, or

   o  analytics partitioning: redirects from other sites may use
      different DNS addresses and/or base URIs, so that they may be
      easily accounted for, while still pointing at the same content.

   The example Base Addresses shown below represent two DNS addresses
   through which content may be accessed as well as an internal IP
   address which may be used for staging:

      baseaddr_id: 1
      baseaddr: wile.e.coyote.acme.com
      metadata_id: 1

      baseaddr_id: 2
      baseaddr: road.runner.acme.com
      metadata_id: 1

      baseaddr_id: 3
      baseaddr: 10.10.10.10/meemeep
      metadata_id: 1

   Note: The exact schema described above may result in heavy
   duplication of Base Addresses.  It is presented as an example for its
   simplicity, however, it may be optimized by using other table joining
   implementation schemes.

2.2.1.  Hierarchical Base Addresses

   In order to support hierarchical Base Addresses, the wildcard '*.'
   SHOULD be allowed as the first part of DNS-type Base Addresses.  The
   wildcard does not make sense at the beginning of IP Address-type Base
   Addresses.  Though a wildcard at the end of IP Address-type Base
   Addresses would make more sense, support for IP Address-type Base
   Addresses is OPTIONAL.  The wildcard signifies the applicability of
   the associated Metadata value to all Base Addresses which match the
   address suffix.

   The following two Base Addresses condense the previous example by
   allowing all acme.com DNS addresses:

      baseaddr_id: 1
      baseaddr: *.acme.com
      metadata_id: 1

      baseaddr_id: 2
      baseaddr: 10.10.10.10/meemeep
      metadata_id: 1

   Note: There is no explicit enforcement that Base Addresses associated
   with a given piece of Metadata not overlap, however, for performance
   reasons, Base Addresses associated with a given piece of Metadata
   SHOULD NOT be allowed to overlap.

2.3.  Agent Table

   The Agent object contains basic information for authenticating
   entities which require access to Metadata.  The example shown
   contains a primary key index, a string containing the username, an
   OPTIONAL string containing the password (possibly hashed or
   encrypted), a boolean value for differentiating between full read/
   write access (e.g., for uCDNs) and read only access (e.g., for
   dCDNs), and a foreign key reference to the Domain to which this Agent
   is associated.  A uniqueness constraint is imposed on username/
   domain_id pairs to prevent duplicate Agent entries for a given
   Domain.

   CREATE TABLE "agent" ("agent_id" serial primary key,
                         "username" character varying(255) NOT NULL,
                         "password" character varying(255),
                         "read_only" boolean DEFAULT false NOT NULL,
                         "domain_id" integer NOT NULL);
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_agent ON agent (username, domain_id);

                          Agent Table Definition

   Note: The password field is included to support the HTTP
   authentication described in the API sections, however, if alternate
   authentication schemes are used, the password may not be necessary.

   The Agent objects manage Metadata access rights.  The Agent
   functionality as described attempts to address two issues:

   o  security concerns: where unauthorized injection or deletion of
      Metadata may alter the functionality of a content service and MUST
      be prevented, as described in the Security Considerations section,
      and

   o  customization requirements: where retrieval of certain metadata
      may require different responses depending on the Agent who is
      accessing the Metadata (e.g., with multiple and/or cascaded
      dCDNs).

   Note: Though both of the above issues could be addressed through
   means outside of the MI, or through a means common to all of the CDNI
   interfaces, the Agent serves the purpose of addressing these needs
   within the context of the MI, in lieu of a consensus alternative and
   as per the CDNI framework document [I-D.davie-cdni-framework].

   The example Agents shown below represent a uCDN Agent with write
   privileges and two dCDN Agents with read-only permissions:

      agent_id: 1
      username: ucdn
      password: xxx

2.4.  Metadata Table

   The Metadata object contains the actual individual pieces of metadata
   for the site being described.  The example shown contains a primary
   key index, a string containing the URI(s) to which the metadata
   applies, a name/value pair of strings which represent the name and
   value of the Metadata, respectively, as well as a boolean value
   stating whether or not the given Metadata must be enforced.  An
   OPTIONAL priority value is included for creating order lists of
   values for a given named Metadata.  An OPTIONAL ttl value and timeout
   field are included to support metadata invalidation.  The table also
   contains a foreign key reference to the Domain to which this Metadata
   is associated and a foreign key reference to the Agent to whom this
   Metadata is intended.  A compound uniqueness constraint is also
   applied to each uri/name/priority/domain_id/agent_id tuple to prevent
   a given Metadata from being ambiguously applied multiple times to the
   same URI in a given Domain for a given Agent.

  CREATE TABLE "metadata" ("metadata_id" serial primary key,
                           "uri" character varying(4095) NOT NULL,
                           "name" character varying(511) NOT NULL,
                           "value" character varying(65535) NOT NULL,
                           "must_enforce" boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL,
                           "priority" integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
                           "ttl" integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
                           "timeout" timestamp without time zone,
                           "domain_id" integer NOT NULL,
                           "agent_id" integer NOT NULL);
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_metadata ON metadata (uri, name, priority,
                                                  domain_id, agent_id);

   The name/value pair is represented as simple opaque strings.  The MI
   does not require and understanding of the semantics or inherent
   meaning of Metadata names or values to distribute the Metadata.
   Though, each piece of Metadata MUST have a defined set of semantics
   in order to be enforced, distributing the Metadata and determining
   whether or not the Metadata is supported does not require any
   understanding of the Metadata semantics, but rather, only an ability
   to identify supported Metadata by their name is REQUIRED.  Metadata
   names SHOULD be properly defined and registered, and any implied
   functionality SHOULD be agreed upon and documented.  A base set of
   CDNI Metadata is provided in the Metadata Definitions Section.

   The intent of the must_enforce boolean is to identify Metadata that
   MUST be enforced by all CDNs.  If a CDN is unable to understand or is
   unable to comply with the Metadata, it MUST NOT deliver the content
   being requested.  For dCDNs, the must_enforce flag defines how to
   respond to MI and RRI requests when unknown or unsupported Metadata

   is encountered.  If Metadata is marked as must_enforce, then the dCDN
   MUST NOT accept any RRI request if it is unable to enforce that piece
   of Metadata (e.g., the named Metadata is not supported, the Metadata
   value is invalid, or the Metadata value is not supported).  If the MI
   request resulted from a "recursive" RRI request, then the dCDN MUST
   return an error to the uCDN.  If the MI request resulted from an
   "iterative" RRI request, then the dCDN MUST respond with a 403
   Forbidden status code to the EU and report the failure to the uCDN.

   In the case of cascaded CDN deployments, though a given CDN may not
   be able to enforce a given piece of Metadata, other CDNs further down
   stream may be able to enforce that Metadata.  When a Metadata
   rejection occurs, the CDN SHOULD still store the Metadata so that it
   can be provided to other dCDNs.

   The OPTIONAL priority value is provided to allow configuration of
   ordered Metadata lists.  When specifying multiple values for a given
   named Metadata, each value MUST be specified with a unique priority
   value.  The explicit priority value enforces a deterministic ordering
   across MI implementations.

   The OPTIONAL ttl value is provided to allow configuration of a
   Metadata TTLs.  If the ttl is specified, it MUST be specified in
   seconds and the timeout field SHOULD be populated by the local MI
   processor and used internally, to prevent the need for clock
   synchronization between MI processors.

   The association of each Metadata to an Agent allows different Agents
   to retrieve different Metadata values for a given URI in the given
   Domain.  This is intended to allow CDNs to separate upstream Metadata
   from downstream Metadata (e.g., a uCDN content acquisition URL may
   point to a CP origin, however, the content acquisition URL that the
   dCDN retrieves from the uCDN may point at a surrogate in the uCDN;
   likewise the content acquisition URLs for different dCDNs may point
   at different surrogates in the uCDN).  Though this information could
   be hidden within a CDN's implementation, the security aspects related
   to deterministically associating an authenticated Agent with the
   proper metadata should be considered as part of the MI.  Explicitly
   representing this in the data model reduces ambiguity in Metadata
   retrieval.

2.4.1.  Hierarchical Metadata

   In order to support hierarchical metadata, '/*' SHOULD be allowed as
   the last part of the URI hierarchy, signifying the application of
   this Metadata value to all URIs which match this URI prefix.  If
   multiple Metadata are defined with overlapping prefixes, the URI with
   the longest prefix match MUST be used.  The uniqueness constraint on

   the uri/name/priority/domain_id tuple allows for unambiguous
   resolution of Metadata priority.

   Note: The wildcard is only supported at the end of the URI string to
   provide a well-defined ordering for URI prefixes (i.e., longest
   prefix matching).  Use of generalized regular expression matching
   requires ordering rules to ensure deterministically coherent results
   across multiple MI implementations.  It is assumed that the URI
   extensions for content will be the same across CDNs.  Any CDN
   specific URL rewrites MUST only affect the Base Address portion of
   the URL as defined in the Base Address.

   Given the following four Metadata objects, the value of color is
   defined five times, for three different URIs, all within the same
   Domain, but for different Agents:

      metadata_id: 1
      uri: /*
      name: color
      value: blue
      must_enforce: false
      priority: 0
      ttl: 0
      domain_id: 1
      agent_id: 2

      metadata_id: 2
      uri: /*
      name: color
      value: gold
      must_enforce: false
      priority: 0
      ttl: 0
      domain_id: 1
      agent_id: 1

      metadata_id: 3
      uri: /*
      name: color
      value: blue
      must_enforce: false
      priority: 1
      ttl: 0
      domain_id: 1
      agent_id: 1

      metadata_id: 4
      uri: /grass/*

      name: color
      value: brown
      must_enforce: false
      priority: 0
      ttl: 0
      domain_id: 1
      agent_id: 2

      metadata_id: 5
      uri: /grass/on/the/other/side/*
      name: color
      value: green
      must_enforce: false
      priority: 0
      ttl: 0
      domain_id: 1
      agent_id: 2

   The default value for the color metadata (signified by the all
   encompassing URI "/*") is blue for the dCDN Agent and gold for the
   uCDN Agent, though the default color may be blue for the uCDN as well
   (as signified by the lower priority alternate color value).
   Alternate colors are associated with requests from the dCDN Agent for
   URIs that begin with "/grass".  By default "/grass" has a color of
   brown, except when requesting "/grass/on/the/other/side/" which is
   green.


3.  CDNI Metadata Bootstrapping

   It is assumed that a well-known hostname to which MI requests should
   be sent is configured through the CDNI bootstrap data.  Bootstrap
   information is sent through the CDNI CI, as described in the CDNI
   requirements document [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements].  The MI APIs
   described herein are intended to be serviced by the MI running on
   that host.

   Domain and Agent configurations must exist prior to Metadata
   creation/retrieval.  Domains and Agents MAY be created as a part of
   an off-line business negotiation process or as a part of the CDNI
   bootstrapping process.  Domain and Agent API descriptions are
   included in Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively.  When the Domain
   and Agent APIs described are used, access to the APIs SHOULD be
   secured using SSL with client authentication as described in the
   Security Considerations section.

   Two sets of Agent configurations are also REQUIRED:

   o  Upstream Agent Configuration: Agent credentials for all external
      agents who require access to the local CDN MI, e.g. for dCDNs to
      retrieve Metadata or for uCDNs to trigger Metadata.

   o  Downstream Agent Configuration: Agent credentials for the local
      CDN to use when accessing uCDN MIs for retrieving Metadata or
      triggering Metadata responses.  Separate credentials may be
      required for each uCDN and Domain combination from which content
      redirections may originate.


4.  CDNI Metadata Management

   The Metadata creation, modification, retrieval and removal protocols
   are defined in the following sections.  All use a simple HTTP-based
   approach.  The protocol, in general, SHOULD be data format agnostic.
   The examples shown herein use an XML representation for MI requests/
   responses, however, other well-defined representations (e.g., JSON)
   are also acceptable.  The examples shown illustrate functionality
   required to support the data model described in Section 2, however,
   any protocol which allows for the forced retrieval, invalidation, and
   removal of Metadata could also be acceptable.

   Metadata creation/update is distinguished from retrieval by the HTTP
   method.  Metadata creation/update MUST use the POST method.  Metadata
   retrieval MUST use the GET method.  Metadata MUST be removed if the
   value field is empty (i.e., updating the value to be an empty string
   MUST force removal of the entire Metadata entry and all associated
   Base Address entries).

   A trigger API is also specified to initiate retrieval of Metadata.
   The uCDN may issue a trigger to the dCDN to force (re)acquisition of
   Metadata by the dCDN.  The trigger API MUST use the POST method.

   In addition to being secured using SSL with client authentication as
   described in the Security Considerations section, the MI SHOULD also
   employ an additional Agent authentication mechanism to filter
   requests and results.  In the examples shown below, HTTP basic
   authentication is used for Agent authentication, though other methods
   (e.g., HTTP digest authentication or URL hashing) could also be used.

4.1.  Metadata API

   The Metadata for a Domain is created/modified/retrieved using the
   "/CDNI/MI/metadata" API.  The metadata API REQUIRES a single query
   string argument "domain" which specifies the name of the Domain to
   which the Metadata being created/modified/retrieved belongs.  Three
   additional OPTIONAL arguments MAY also be provided when retrieving

   metadata: "name" which specifies the name of the Metadata field to
   create/modify/retrieve, "uri" which specifies the URI for which the
   Metadata must apply, and/or "agent" which specifies the agent(s) to
   which the Metadata is associated, as a comma separated list.  The
   "agent" option MUST only be allowed for agents with full read/write
   permissions.

   A simple XML representation of the information provided to the
   metadata creation/update API or returned from the metadata retrieval
   API is shown below:

      <metadatas>
        <metadata>
          <uri></uri>
          <name></name>
          <values>

          </baseaddrs>
        </metadata>
        ...
      </metadatas>

   Metadata retrieval for a Domain may be triggered using the "/CDNI/MI/
   trigger" API.  The trigger API provides the information required to
   issue a metadata API retrieval request (i.e., the "domain", "name,
   and "uri" query string arguments).  The metadata API REQUIRES a
   single query string argument "action" which specifies what type of
   action is being triggered.

   The following actions MUST be supported:

   o  refresh: The dCDN MUST retrieve and update all Metadata specified
      in the trigger.

   The following actions are considered OPTIONAL:

4.1.6.  Metadata Errors

   For any update, retrieval, or trigger request with malformed XML, the
   MI SHOULD respond with a 400 Bad Request status code.  Ancillary
   unknown tags MAY be ignored.

   For any trigger requests with an unsupported action, the MI SHOULD
   respond with a 403 Forbidden status code.

   For any update or retrieval request for a uri/name/domain_id tuple
   which does not exist, the MI SHOULD respond with a 404 Not Found
   status code.

   For any request which lacks a valid Agent authorization, the MI MUST
   respond with a 401 Unauthorized status code.  This includes Agents
   with valid credentials, but who are marked as read_only and have
   requested Metadata associated with an alternate Agent through the
   specification of an "agent" query string parameter.

   For any request which results in Metadata with an expired TTL, and
   for which an update cannot be retrieved from an upstream MI, the MI
   MUST respond to with a 500 Internal Server status code.

4.1.7.  Metadata Prepositioning

   The metadata creation/modification/removal APIs discussed above
   SHOULD only be used by uCDNs to manage Metadata in the local CDN.

Internet-Draft                CDNI Metadata                   April 2012


   Though the metadata creation/modification/removal APIs could be used
   to preposition metadata in dCDNs, the trigger API allows the uCDN to
   force refresh of the dCDN Metadata without directly posting Metadata
   to the dCDN.  This allows the dCDNs to manage retrieval of Metadata
   using lazy updates.

   dCDNs SHOULD NOT modify metadata dictated by a uCDN. dCDNs SHOULD
   only be assigned Agents with read_only access and SHOULD NOT have
   access to uCDN Domain or Agent APIs (restricted through the use of
   different SSL client authentication certificates, as described in the
   Security Considerations section).


5.  Metadata Definitions

   This section defines a base set of Metadata which SHOULD be supported
   by all CDNI implementations.

5.1.  Origin Server

   Content which is not pre-positioned must be acquired by the CDN from
   an origin server.  The origin server Metadata specifies the base URL
   to which the content request URI may be appended in order to acquire
   the content.  The origin server Metadata is defined as having the
   name "origin_server", with valid values containing a comma separated
   list of base URLs, and the must_enforce flag set to false:

      name: origin_server
      value: <url>
      must_enforce: false

   In some cases, multiple non-load balanced origin servers may be
   available for content acquisition.  The origin server Metadata SHOULD
   support an unprioritized comma separate list of base URL values.

   Note: The origin list Metadata is not a must_enforce, since, if the
   content cannot be acquired, there is no threat of unauthorized
   content distribution.  Other Metadata or content pre-positioning may
   negate the need for origin server Metadata.

5.2.  Activation Time

   Content may be pre-positioned in anticipation of demand, however, the
   content license may have restrictions on delivery timeframe.  The
   activation time Metadata specifies the first time at which the
   content may be delivered.  The activation time Metadata is defined as
   having the name "activation_time", with valid timestamp values that
   MUST conform to RFC3339 [RFC3339], and the must_enforce flag set to



Ma                      Expires October 29, 2012               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                CDNI Metadata                   April 2012


   true:

      name: activation_time
      value: <timestamp>
      must_enforce: true

   If the activation time Metadata is set and the current time is less
   than the specified activation time, the CDN MUST respond to requests
   for that content with a 403 Forbidden status code (or equivalent for
   the given non-HTTP request protocol).

5.3.  Deactivation Time

   Content may be pre-positioned in anticipation of demand, however, the
   content license may have restrictions on delivery timeframe.  The
   deactivation time Metadata specifies the last time at which the
   content may be delivered.  The deactivation time Metadata is defined
   as having the name "deactivation_time", with valid timestamp values
   that MUST conform to RFC3339 [RFC3339], and the must_enforce flag set
   to true:

      name: deactivation_time
      value: <timestamp>
      must_enforce: true

   If the deactivation time Metadata is set and the current time is
   greater than the specified activation time, the CDN MUST respond to
   requests for that content with a 403 Forbidden status code (or
   equivalent for the given non-HTTP request protocol).

5.4.  Administrative Disable

   It is sometimes necessary to temporarily disable the distribution of
   certain media (e.g., inappropriate content, irregular access
   patterns, etc.) within a set accessibility period (i.e., the
   activation/deactivation time range).  The administrative disable
   Metadata instructs the CDN not to deliver the specified content under
   any circumstances.  The administrative disable Metadata is defined as
   having the name "admin_disable", with two valid values "true" and
   "false", and the must_enforce flag set to true:

      name: admin_disable
      value: [true | false]
      must_enforce: true

   If the administrative disable Metadata is set to "true", the CDN MUST
   respond to requests for that content with a 403 Forbidden status code
   (or equivalent for the given non-HTTP request protocol).

5.5.  Delegation Depth

   CSPs may wish to prevent cascading CDNs to enforce licensing
   restrictions.  The delegation depth Metadata instructs the CDN to
   only delegate requests for the specified content if the delegation
   depth is greater than zero.  If the depth is less than or equal to
   zero, a uCDN should not delegate requests for the specified content
   to any dCDNs under any circumstances.  When distributing the
   delegation depth Metadata the uCDN MUST decrement the value of
   delegation depth by at least one if the current value is greater than
   zero.  The uCDN MAY choose not to decrement the value if the value is
   already less than or equal to zero.  The uCDN MAY decrement by more
   than one in order to get to zero.  The delegation depth Metadata is
   defined as having the name "delegate_depth", with an integer value
   and the must_enforce flag set to true:

      name: delegate_depth
      value: <integer>
      must_enforce: true

   If the delegation depth Metadata is less than or equal to 0, the CDN
   MUST either service the content requests itself or respond to
   requests for that content with a 504 Server Busy status code (or
   equivalent for the given non-HTTP request protocol).

5.6.  Footprint Filter

   CSPs often purchase rights to content which are only valid when
   accessed from certain locations (e.g., within a given country or
   through a given access network).  The footprint filter Metadata
   provides a list of valid source IP subnets from which content
   requests may be accepted.  The footprint filter Metadata is defined
   as having the name "footprint", with valid values containing a comma
   separated list of IP subnet definitions, and the must_enforce flag
   set to true:

      name: footprint
      value: <ip_subnet> [, <ip_subnet>]...
      must_enforce: true

   If the footprint filter Metadata is set and the source address of a
   requesting client does not match any of the IP subnets listed, the
   CDN MUST respond to the content request with a 403 Forbidden status
   code (or equivalent for the given non-HTTP request protocol).

Internet-Draft                CDNI Metadata                   April 2012


5.7.  HTTP Header Filter

   CSPs often desire the ability to filter requests based on the
   existence of specific HTTP header fields and values (e.g., User-Agent
   headers for device detection or custom headers inserted by client-
   side applications).  The HTTP header filter Metadata provides a list
   of HTTP header names and values which must be verified.  The HTTP
   header filter Metadata is defined as having the name "http_headers",
   with valid values containing a comma separated list of HTTP header
   names and regular expression matching criteria definitions, and the
   must_enforce flag set to true:

      name: http_headers
      value: <name>:<regex> [, <name>:<regex>]...
      must_enforce: true

   If the HTTP header filter Metadata is set and the HTTP headers of the
   content request do not match all of the filters specified, the CDN
   MUST respond to the content request with a 403 Forbidden status code
   (or equivalent for the given non-HTTP request protocol).

5.8.  Protocol Filter

   Though content is typically only accessible using specific a protocol
   (e.g., HTTP, RTMP, or RTSP), a CSP may wish to explicitly allow/
   disallow access to certain content for a given protocol.  The
   protocol filter Metadata provides a list of allowed protocols via
   which content may be delivered.  The protocol filter Metadata is
   defined as having the name "protocol", with valid values containing a
   comma separate list of protocol strings, and the must_enforce flag
   set to true:

      name: protocols
      value: <protocol> [, <protocol>]...
      must_enforce: true

   If the protocol filter Metadata is set and the request protocol does
   not match any protocol in the list, the CDN MUST respond to the
   content request with a 403 Forbidden status code (or equivalent for
   the given non-HTTP request protocol).

5.9.  SSL Required

   CSPs which require delivery privacy may require dCDNs to support the
   same SSL configurations which were applied to the uCDN.  The SSL
   required Metadata expresses the requirement to enforce SSL on content
   request connections and provides the necessary key and certificate
   information required for server authentication.  The SSL required

Internet-Draft                CDNI Metadata                   April 2012


   Metadata is defined as having the name "ssl_required", with valid
   values containing two URLs (comma separated) which point to the key
   and certificate, respectively, and the must_enforce flag set to true:

      name: ssl_required
      value: <key_url>,<cert_url>
      must_enforce: true

   If the SSL required Metadata is set and the request is not received
   over an SSL channel, the CDN MUST respond to the content request with
   a 403 Forbidden status code (or equivalent for the given non-HTTP
   request protocol).

   Note: Retrieval of server key and certificate information SHOULD be
   performed in a secure manner.  Retrieval could be implemented through
   the CDNI MI, however, this is not required.

5.10.  SSL Client Authentication Required

   CSPs which require client authentication may require dCDNs to support
   a SSL client authentication configuration which was applied to the
   uCDN.  The SSL client authentication required Metadata expresses the
   requirement to enforce SSL client authentication on content requests
   and provides the necessary certificate authority (CA) information for
   authenticating clients.  The SSL client authentication required
   Metadata is defined as having the name "ssl_auth_required", with
   valid values containing a single URL which points to the CA
   certificate to be used in client verification, and the must_enforce
   flag set to true:

      name: ssl_auth_required
      value: <ca_url>
      must_enforce: true

   If the SSL client authentication required Metadata is set and the
   client certificate cannot be verified using the CA certificate, the
   CDN MUST respond with a handshake_failure alert.

5.11.  URL Hash

   TBD.

   [Ed.  Note: There are many proprietary URL hashing techniques in use
   today with varying timestamp formats, query string parameter names,
   hashing algorithm combinations, etc.  A generic definition of URL
   hashing algorithm parameters, capable of supporting all algorithms
   would be best.]

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of security concerns associated with the MI as
   Metadata may be used to influence CDNI request routing.  Metadata may
   describe content acquisition parameters or content security
   restrictions.  Altering Metadata or inhibiting Metadata discovery may
   impact content distribution.  Some MI concerns include:

   o  intercepting and discarding Metadata requests to prevent content
      acquisition may be used as a denial of service attack,

   o  altering content acquisition Metadata to prevent content
      acquisition may be used as a denial of service attack, and

   o  spoofing content security Metadata to disable delivery
      restrictions may be used to circumvent rights management.

   To combat these concerns, unauthorized access to the MI MUST be
   prevented.  The use of SSL with client authentication SHOULD be used
   for all MI APIs.  Deployments in controlled environments where
   physical security and IP address white-listing is employed MAY choose
   not to use SSL.  Different client authentication certificates SHOULD
   be used to protect access to Domain and Agent APIs, as well as uCDN
   access to the Metadata API, differently from dCDN access to the
   Metadata API.  Deployments where uCDNs and dCDNs are mutually trusted
   entities (e.g., when uCDNs and dCDNs are controlled by the same
   corporate organization) MAY choose to use a single client
   authentication certificate.

   responses, however, other well-defined representations (e.g., JSON)
   are also acceptable.  The examples shown illustrate the functionality
   required to support the data model described in Section 2, however,
   any protocol which allows for the creation, modification, retrieval,
   and removal of Domains could also be acceptable.

   Domain creation/update is distinguished from domain retrieval and
   removal by the HTTP method.  Domain creation/update MUST use the POST
   method.  Domain retrieval MUST use the GET method.  Domain removal
   MUST use the DELETE method.

   All Agents and Metadata MUST be associated with a Domain.  A Domain
   is created/modified/retrieved/removed using the "/CDNI/MI/domain"
   API.  The domain API REQUIRES a single query string argument "domain"
   which specifies the name of the Domain to be created/modified/
   retrieved.

   A simple XML representation of the information provided to the domain
   creation/update API or returned from the domain retrieval API is
   shown below:

      <domain>
        <provider></provider>
        <description></description>

                   bird seed, and rocket-powered footwear.</description>
    </domain>

9.3.  Domain Retrieval

   The following example retrieves the updated "acme" Domain
   information:

     GET /CDNI/MI/domain?domain=acme HTTP/1.1
     Host: host.mi.cdni.example.com
     Accept: */*

                    bird seed, and rocket powered footwear</description>
     </domain>

   The MI MAY support bulk retrieval of Domains through the use of a
   comma separated list of Domain names in the domain query string
   parameter.

9.4.  Domain Removal

   The following example removes the "acme" Domain:

      DELETE /CDNI/MI/domain?domain=acme HTTP/1.1

   Any update or retrieval request for a Domain which does not exist
   SHOULD respond with a 404 Not Found status code.


10.  Appendix B: Agent API

   Agent creation, modification, retrieval, and removal protocols are
   defined in the following sections.  All use a simple HTTP-based
   approach.  The protocol, in general, SHOULD be data format agnostic.
   The examples shown herein use an XML representation for MI requests/
   responses, however, other well-defined representations (e.g., JSON)
   are also acceptable.  The examples shown illustrate the functionality
   required to support the data model described in Section 2, however,
   any protocol which allows for the creation, modification, retrieval,
   and removal of Agents could also be acceptable.

   Agent creation/update is distinguished from Agent retrieval and
   removal by the HTTP method.  Agent creation/update MUST use the POST
   method.  Agent retrieval MUST use the GET method.  Agent removal MUST
   use the DELETE method and specify the Agent name(s) in the query
   string.

   All Metadata MUST be associated with an Agent.  An Agent is created/
   modified/retrieved/removed using the "/CDNI/MI/agent" API.  The agent
   API REQUIRES a single query string argument "domain" which specifies
   the name of the Domain to which the Agent has access.  In the case of
   DELETEs, the agent API also REQUIRES a query string argument "agent"
   which specifies the name(s) of the Agent(s) to remove, as a comma
   separated list.

   A simple XML representation of the information provided to the agent
   creation/update API or returned from the agent retrieval API is shown
