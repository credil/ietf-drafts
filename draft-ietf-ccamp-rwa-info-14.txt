Abstract 

   This document provides a model of information needed by the routing 
   and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength switched 
   optical networks (WSONs).  The purpose of the information described 
   in this model is to facilitate constrained lightpath computation in 
   WSONs. This model takes into account compatibility constraints 
   between WSON signal attributes and network elements but does not 
   include constraints due to optical impairments. Aspects of this 
   information that may be of use to other technologies utilizing a 
   GMPLS control plane are discussed.

1. Introduction 

   The purpose of the following information model for WSONs is to 
   facilitate constrained lightpath computation and as such is not a 
   general purpose network management information model. This 
   constraint is frequently referred to as the "wavelength continuity" 
   constraint, and the corresponding constrained lightpath computation 
   is known as the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem. 
   Hence the information model must provide sufficient topology and 
   wavelength restriction and availability information to support this 
   computation. More details on the RWA process and WSON subsystems and 
   their properties can be found in [RFC6163]. The model defined here

   includes constraints between WSON signal attributes and network 
   elements, but does not include optical impairments.  

   In addition to presenting an information model suitable for path 
   computation in WSON, this document also highlights model aspects 
   that may have general applicability to other technologies utilizing 
   a GMPLS control plane.  The portion of the information model 
   applicable to other technologies beyond WSON is referred to as 
   "general" to distinguish it from the "WSON-specific" portion that is 
   applicable only to WSON technology.

3. Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Model 

   The following WSON RWA information model is grouped into four 
   categories regardless of whether they stem from a switching 
   subsystem or from a line subsystem: 

   o  Node Information 

   o  Link Information 

   o  Dynamic Node Information 

   o  Dynamic Link Information 

   Note that this is roughly the categorization used in [G.7715] 
   section 7.  

   In the following, where applicable, the reduced Backus-Naur form 
   (RBNF) syntax of [RBNF] is used to aid in defining the RWA 
   information model.  

   3.1. Dynamic and Relatively Static Information 

   All the RWA information of concern in a WSON network is subject to 
   change over time.  Equipment can be upgraded; links may be placed in 
   or out of service and the like.  However, from the point of view of 
   RWA computations there is a difference between information that can 
   change with each successive connection establishment in the network 
 
 
Bernstein & Lee       Expires September 6, 2012                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft          WSON Information Model               March 2012 
    

   and that information that is relatively static on the time scales of 
   connection establishment. A key example of the former is link 
   wavelength usage since this can change with connection 
   setup/teardown and this information is a key input to the RWA 
   process.  Examples of relatively static information are the 
   potential port connectivity of a WDM ROADM, and the channel spacing 
   on a WDM link. 

   This document separates, where possible, dynamic and static 
   information so that these can be kept separate in possible encodings 
   and hence allowing for separate updates of these two types of 
   information thereby reducing processing and traffic load caused by 
   the timely distribution of the more dynamic RWA WSON information. 

4. Node Information (General) 

   The node information described here contains the relatively static 
   information related to a WSON node. This includes connectivity 
   constraints amongst ports and wavelengths since WSON switches can 
   exhibit asymmetric switching properties. Additional information 
   could include properties of wavelength converters in the node if any 
   are present. In [Switch] it was shown that the wavelength 
   connectivity constraints for a large class of practical WSON devices 
   can be modeled via switched and fixed connectivity matrices along 
   with corresponding switched and fixed port constraints. These 
   connectivity matrices are included with the node information while 
   the switched and fixed port wavelength constraints are included with 
   the link information. 

   Formally, 

   <Node_Information> ::= <Node_ID> [<ConnectivityMatrix>...]  

   Where the Node_ID would be an appropriate identifier for the node 
   within the WSON RWA context.  

   Note that multiple connectivity matrices are allowed and hence can 
   fully support the most general cases enumerated in [Switch].  

   4.1. Connectivity Matrix 

   The connectivity matrix (ConnectivityMatrix) represents either the 
   potential connectivity matrix for asymmetric switches (e.g. ROADMs 
   and such) or fixed connectivity for an asymmetric device such as a 
   multiplexer. Note that this matrix does not represent any particular 
   internal blocking behavior but indicates which inputinput ports and 
   wavelengths could possibly be connected to a particular output port. 
 
 
Bernstein & Lee       Expires September 6, 2012                [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft          WSON Information Model               March 2012 
    

   Representing internal state dependent blocking for a switch or ROADM 
   is beyond the scope of this document and due to its highly 
   implementation dependent nature would most likely not be subject to 
   standardization in the future. The connectivity matrix is a 
   conceptual M by N matrix representing the potential switched or 
   fixed connectivity, where M represents the number of inputinput 
   ports and N the number of outputoutput ports. This is a "conceptual" 
   matrix since the matrix tends to exhibit structure that allows for 
   very compact representations that are useful for both transmission 
   and path computation [Encode]. 

   Note that the connectivity matrix information element can be useful 
   in any technology context where asymmetric switches are utilized. 

   ConnectivityMatrix ::= <MatrixID> <ConnType> <Matrix> 

   Where  

   <MatrixID> is a unique identifier for the matrix.  

   <ConnType> can be either 0 or 1 depending upon whether the 
   connectivity is either fixed or potentially switched. 

   <Matrix> represents the fixed or switched connectivity in that 
   Matrix(i, j) = 0 or 1 depending on whether inputinput port i can 
   connect to outputoutput port j for one or more wavelengths. 

   4.2. Shared Risk Node Group 

   SRNG: Shared risk group for nodes. The concept of a shared risk link 
   group was defined in [RFC4202]. This can be used to achieve a 
   desired "amount" of link diversity. It is also desirable to have a 
   similar capability to achieve various degrees of node diversity. 
   This is explained in [G.7715]. Typical risk groupings for nodes can 
   include those nodes in the same building, within the same city, or 
   geographic region. 

   Since the failure of a node implies the failure of all links 
   associated with that node a sufficiently general shared risk link 
   group (SRLG) encoding, such as that used in GMPLS routing extensions 
   can explicitly incorporate SRNG information. 

5. Node Information (WSON specific) 

   As discussed in [RFC6163] a WSON node may contain electro-optical 
   subsystems such as regenerators, wavelength converters or entire 
   switching subsystems. The model present here can be used in 
 
 
Bernstein & Lee       Expires September 6, 2012                [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft          WSON Information Model               March 2012 
    

   characterizing the accessibility and availability of limited 
   resources such as regenerators or wavelength converters as well as 
   WSON signal attribute constraints of electro-optical subsystems. As 
   such this information element is fairly specific to WSON 
   technologies.  

   A WSON node may include regenerators or wavelength converters 
   arranged in a shared pool. As discussed in [RFC6163] this can 
   include OEO based WDM switches as well. There are a number of 
   different approaches used in the design of WDM switches containing 
   regenerator or converter pools. However, from the point of view of 
   path computation the following need to be known: 

   1. The nodes that support regeneration or wavelength conversion. 

   2. The accessibility and availability of a wavelength converter to 
      convert from a given inputinput wavelength on a particular 
      inputinput port to a desired outputoutput wavelength on a 
      particular outputoutput port. 

   3. Limitations on the types of signals that can be converted and the 
      conversions that can be performed. 

   Since resources tend to be packaged together in blocks of similar 
   devices, e.g., on line cards or other types of modules, the 
   fundamental unit of identifiable resource in this document is the 
   "resource block". A resource block may contain one or more 
   resources. As resources are the smallest identifiable unit of 
   processing resource, one can group together resources into blocks if 
   they have similar characteristics relevant to the optical system 
   being modeled, e.g., processing properties, accessibility, etc. 

   This leads to the following formal high level model: 

   <Node_Information> ::= <Node_ID> [<ConnectivityMatrix>...] 
   [<ResourcePool>]  

   Where 

   <ResourcePool> ::= <ResourceBlockInfo>... 
   [<ResourceAccessibility>...] [<ResourceWaveConstraints>...] 
   [<RBPoolState>] 

   First the accessibility of resource blocks is addressed then their 
   properties are discussed.

Internet-Draft          WSON Information Model               March 2012 
    

   5.1. Resource Accessibility/Availability 

   A similar technique as used to model ROADMs and optical switches can 
   be used to model regenerator/converter accessibility. This technique 
   was generally discussed in [RFC6163] and consisted of a matrix to 
   indicate possible connectivity along with wavelength constraints for 
   links/ports. Since regenerators or wavelength converters may be 
   considered a scarce resource it is desirable that the model include, 
   if desired, the usage state (availability) of individual 
   regenerators or converters in the pool. Models that incorporate more 
   state to further reveal blocking conditions on input or output to 
   particular converters are for further study and not included here. 

   The three stage model is shown schematically in Figure 1 and Figure 
   2. The difference between the two figures is that Figure 1 assumes 
   that each signal that can get to a resource block may do so, while 
   in Figure 2 the access to sets of resource blocks is via a shared 
   fiber which imposes its own wavelength collision constraint. The 
   representation of Figure 1 can have more than one input to each 
   resource block since each input represents a single wavelength 
   signal, while in Figure 2 shows a single multiplexed WDM inputinput 
   or output, e.g., a fiber, to/from each set of block. 

   This model assumes N input ports (fibers), P resource blocks 
   containing one or more identical resources (e.g. wavelength 
   converters), and M output ports (fibers). Since not all input ports 
   can necessarily reach each resource block, the model starts with a 
   resource pool input matrix RI(i,p) = {0,1} whether input port i can 
   reach potentially reach resource block p.  

   Since not all wavelengths can necessarily reach all the resources or 
   the resources may have limited input wavelength range the model has 
   a set of relatively static input port constraints for each resource. 
   In addition, if the access to a set of resource blocks is via a 
   shared fiber (Figure 2) this would impose a dynamic wavelength 
   availability constraint on that shared fiber. The resource block 
   input port constraint is modeled via a static wavelength set 
   mechanism and the case of shared access to a set of blocks is 
   modeled via a dynamic wavelength set mechanism. 

   Next a state vector RA(j) = {0,...,k} is used to track the number of 
   resources in resource block j in use. This is the only state kept in 
   the resource pool model. This state is not necessary for modeling

   After that, a set of static resource output wavelength constraints 
   and possibly dynamic shared output fiber constraints maybe used. The 
   static constraints indicate what wavelengths a particular resource 
   block can generate or are restricted to generating e.g., a fixed 
   regenerator would be limited to a single lambda. The dynamic 
   constraints would be used in the case where a single shared fiber is 
   used to output the resource block (Figure 2). 

   Finally, to complete the model, a resource pool output matrix 
   RE(p,k) = {0,1} depending on whether the output from resource block 
   p can reach output port k, may be used.

   Note that except for <ResourcePoolState> all the other components of 
   <ResourcePool> are relatively static. Also the 
   <InAvailableWavelengths> and <OutAvailableWavelengths> are only used 
   in the cases of shared input or output access to the particular 
   block. See the resource block information in the next section to see 
   how this is specified. 
    
    
    
   5.2. Resource Signal Constraints and Processing Capabilities 

   The wavelength conversion abilities of a resource (e.g. regenerator, 
   wavelength converter) were modeled in the <OutputWaveConstraints> 
   previously discussed. As discussed in [RFC6163] the constraints on 
   an electro-optical resource can be modeled in terms of input 
   constraints, processing capabilities, and output constraints: 

   <ResourceBlockInfo> ::= ([<ResourceSet>] <InputConstraints> 
   [<ProcessingCapabilities>] <OutputConstraints>)* 

   Where  <ResourceSet> is a list of resource block identifiers with 
   the same characteristics. If this set is missing the constraints are 
   applied to the entire network element. 

   The <InputConstraints> are signal compatibility based constraints 
   and/or shared access constraint indication. The details of these 
   constraints are defined in section 5.3.  

   <InputConstraints> ::= <SharedInput> [<ModulationTypeList>] 
   [<FECTypeList>] [<BitRateRange>] [<ClientSignalList>] 

   The <ProcessingCapabilities> are important operations that the 
   resource (or network element) can perform on the signal. The details 
   of these capabilities are defined in section 5.3.  

   <ProcessingCapabilities> ::= [<NumResources>] 
   [<RegenerationCapabilities>] [<FaultPerfMon>] [<VendorSpecific>] 

   The <OutputConstraints> are either restrictions on the properties of 
   the signal leaving the block, options concerning the signal 
   properties when leaving the resource or shared fiber output 
   constraint indication. 

   <OutputConstraints> := <SharedOutput> [<ModulationTypeList>] 
   [<FECTypeList>]

   5.3. Compatibility and Capability Details 

   5.3.1. Shared Input or Output Indication 

   As discussed in the previous section and shown in Figure 2 the input 
   or output access to a resource block may be via a shared fiber. The 
   <SharedInput> and <SharedOutput> elements are indicators for this 
   condition with respect to the block being described. 

      5.3.2. Modulation Type List 

      Modulation type, also known as optical tributary signal class, 
      comes in two distinct flavors: (i) ITU-T standardized types; (ii) 
      vendor specific types. The permitted modulation type list can 
      include any mixture of standardized and vendor specific types.  

      <modulation-list>::= 
      [<STANDARD_MODULATION>|<VENDOR_MODULATION>]... 

      Where the STANDARD_MODULATION object just represents one of the 
      ITU-T standardized optical tributary signal class and the 
      VENDOR_MODULATION object identifies one vendor specific 
      modulation type. 

      5.3.3. FEC Type List 

      Some devices can handle more than one FEC type and hence a list 
      is needed.  

      <fec-list>::= [<FEC>] 

      Where the FEC object represents one of the ITU-T standardized 
      FECs defined in [G.709], [G.707], [G.975.1] or a vendor-specific 
      FEC.   

      5.3.4. Bit Rate Range List 

      Some devices can handle more than one particular bit rate range 
      and hence a list is needed. 

      <rate-range-list>::= [<rate-range>]... 

      <rate-range>::=<START_RATE><END_RATE> 

      Where the START_RATE object represents the lower end of the range 
      and the END_RATE object represents the higher end of the range.

      5.3.5. Acceptable Client Signal List 

      The list is simply: 

      <client-signal-list>::=[<GPID>]... 

      Where the Generalized Protocol Identifiers (GPID) object 
      represents one of the IETF standardized GPID values as defined in 
      [RFC3471] and [RFC4328]. 

      5.3.6. Processing Capability List 

     The ProcessingCapabilities were defined in Section 5.2 as follows: 

     <ProcessingCapabilities> ::= [<NumResources>] 
     [<RegenerationCapabilities>] [<FaultPerfMon>] [<VendorSpecific>] 

     The processing capability list sub-TLV is a list of processing 
     functions that the WSON network element (NE) can perform on the 
     signal including:  

        1. Number of Resources within the block 

        2. Regeneration capability 

        3. Fault and performance monitoring 

        4. Vendor Specific capability  

     Note that the code points for Fault and performance monitoring and 
     vendor specific capability are subject to further study.  

       

6. Link Information (General) 

   MPLS-TE routing protocol extensions for OSPF and IS-IS [RFC3630], 
   [RFC5305] along with GMPLS routing protocol extensions for OSPF and 
   IS-IS [RFC4203, RFC5307] provide the bulk of the relatively static 
   link information needed by the RWA process. However, WSON networks 
   bring in additional link related constraints. These stem from WDM 
   line system characterization, laser transmitter tuning restrictions, 
   and switching subsystem port wavelength constraints, e.g., colored 
   ROADM drop ports.

   In the following summarize both information from existing GMPLS 
   route protocols and new information that maybe needed by the RWA 
   process. 

   <LinkInfo> ::=  <LinkID> [<AdministrativeGroup>] 
   [<InterfaceCapDesc>] [<Protection>] [<SRLG>]... 
   [<TrafficEngineeringMetric>] [<PortLabelRestriction>] 

   6.1. Administrative Group 

   AdministrativeGroup: Defined in [RFC3630]. Each set bit corresponds 
   to one administrative group assigned to the interface.  A link may 
   belong to multiple groups. This is a configured quantity and can be 
   used to influence routing decisions. 

   6.2. Interface Switching Capability Descriptor 

   InterfaceSwCapDesc: Defined in [RFC4202], lets us know the different 
   switching capabilities on this GMPLS interface. In both [RFC4203] 
   and [RFC5307] this information gets combined with the maximum LSP 
   bandwidth that can be used on this link at eight different priority 
   levels. 

   6.3. Link Protection Type (for this link) 

   Protection: Defined in [RFC4202] and implemented in [RFC4203, 
   RFC5307]. Used to indicate what protection, if any, is guarding this 
   link. 

   6.4. Shared Risk Link Group Information 

   SRLG: Defined in [RFC4202] and implemented in [RFC4203, RFC5307]. 
   This allows for the grouping of links into shared risk groups, i.e., 
   those links that are likely, for some reason, to fail at the same 
   time. 

   6.5. Traffic Engineering Metric 

   TrafficEngineeringMetric: Defined in [RFC3630].  This allows for the 
   definition of one additional link metric value for traffic 
   engineering separate from the IP link state routing protocols link 
   metric. Note that multiple "link metric values" could find use in 
   optical networks, however it would be more useful to the RWA process 
   to assign these specific meanings such as link mile metric, or 
   probability of failure metric, etc...

   6.6. Port Label (Wavelength) Restrictions 

   Port label (wavelength) restrictions (PortLabelRestriction) model 
   the label (wavelength) restrictions that the link and various 
   optical devices such as OXCs, ROADMs, and waveband multiplexers may 
   impose on a port. These restrictions tell us what wavelength may or 
   may not be used on a link and are relatively static. This plays an 
   important role in fully characterizing a WSON switching device 
   [Switch]. Port wavelength restrictions are specified relative to the 
   port in general or to a specific connectivity matrix (section 4.1.  
   Reference [Switch] gives an example where both switch and fixed 
   connectivity matrices are used and both types of constraints occur 
   on the same port. Such restrictions could be applied generally to 
   other label types in GMPLS by adding new kinds of restrictions. 

   <PortLabelRestriction> ::= [<GeneralPortRestrictions>...] 
   [<MatrixSpecificRestrictions>...] 

   <GeneralPortRestrictions> ::= <RestrictionType> 
   [<RestrictionParameters>] 

   <MatrixSpecificRestriction> ::= <MatrixID> <RestrictionType> 
   [<RestrictionParameters>] 

   <RestrictionParameters> ::= [<LabelSet>...] [<MaxNumChannels>] 
   [<MaxWaveBandWidth>] 

 

   Where  

   MatrixID is the ID of the corresponding connectivity matrix (section 
   4.1.  

   The RestrictionType parameter is used to specify general port 
   restrictions and matrix specific restrictions. It can take the 
   following values and meanings: 

   SIMPLE_WAVELENGTH:   Simple wavelength set restriction; The 
   wavelength set parameter is required.  

   CHANNEL_COUNT: The number of channels is restricted to be less than 
   or equal to the Max number of channels parameter (which is 
   required).

Internet-Draft          WSON Information Model               March 2012 
    

   PORT_WAVELENGTH_EXCLUSIVITY: A wavelength can be used at most once 
   among a given set of ports. The set of ports is specified as a 
   parameter to this constraint. 

   WAVEBAND1:   Waveband device with a tunable center frequency and 
   passband. This constraint is characterized by the MaxWaveBandWidth 
   parameters which indicates the maximum width of the waveband in 
   terms of channels. Note that an additional wavelength set can be 
   used to indicate the overall tuning range. Specific center frequency 
   tuning information can be obtained from dynamic channel in use 
   information. It is assumed that both center frequency and bandwidth 
   (Q) tuning can be done without causing faults in existing signals. 

   Restriction specific parameters are used with one or more of the 
   previously listed restriction types. The currently defined 
   parameters are: 

     LabelSet is a conceptual set of labels (wavelengths).  

     MaxNumChannels is the maximum number of channels that can be 
     simultaneously used (relative to either a port or a matrix). 

     MaxWaveBandWidth is the maximum width of a tunable waveband 
     switching device. 

     PortSet is a conceptual set of ports. 

   For example, if the port is a "colored" drop port of a ROADM then 
   there are two restrictions: (a) CHANNEL_COUNT, with MaxNumChannels = 
   1, and (b) SIMPLE_WAVELENGTH, with the wavelength set consisting of 
   a single member corresponding to the frequency of the permitted 
   wavelength. See [Switch] for a complete waveband example. 

   This information model for port wavelength (label) restrictions is 
   fairly general in that it can be applied to ports that have label 
   restrictions only or to ports that are part of an asymmetric switch 
   and have label restrictions. In addition, the types of label 
   restrictions that can be supported are extensible. 

   6.6.1. Port-Wavelength Exclusivity Example 

   Although there can be many different ROADM or switch architectures 
   that can lead to the constraint where a lambda (label) maybe used at 
   most once on a set of ports Figure 3 shows a ROADM architecture 
   based on components known as a Wavelength Selective Switch 
   (WSS)[OFC08]. This ROADM is composed of splitters, combiners, and 
   WSSes. This ROADM has 11 output ports, which are numbered in the

   diagram. Output ports 1-8 are known as drop ports and are intended 
   to support a single wavelength. Drop ports 1-4 output from WSS #2, 
   which is fed from WSS #1 via a single fiber. Due to this internal 
   structure a constraint is placed on the output ports 1-4 that a 
   lambda can be only used once over the group of ports (assuming uni-
   cast and not multi-cast operation). Similarly the output ports 5-8 
   have a similar constraint due to the internal structure.

Internet-Draft          WSON Information Model               March 2012 
    

7. Dynamic Components of the Information Model 

   In the previously presented information model there are a limited 
   number of information elements that are dynamic, i.e., subject to 
   change with subsequent establishment and teardown of connections. 
   Depending on the protocol used to convey this overall information 
   model it may be possible to send this dynamic information separate 
   from the relatively larger amount of static information needed to 
   characterize WSON's and their network elements. 

   7.1. Dynamic Link Information (General) 

   For WSON links wavelength availability and wavelengths in use for 
   shared backup purposes can be considered dynamic information and 
   hence are grouped with the dynamic information in the following set: 

   <DynamicLinkInfo> ::=  <LinkID> <AvailableLabels> 
   [<SharedBackupLabels>] 

   AvailableLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths) currently available 
   on the link. Given this information and the port wavelength 
   restrictions one can also determine which wavelengths are currently 
   in use. This parameter could potential be used with other 
   technologies that GMPLS currently covers or may cover in the future. 

   SharedBackupLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths) currently used 
   for shared backup protection on the link. An example usage of this 
   information in a WSON setting is given in [Shared]. This parameter 
   could potential be used with other technologies that GMPLS currently 
   covers or may cover in the future. 

   Note that the above does not dictate a particular encoding or 
   placement for available label information. In some routing protocols 
   it may be advantageous or required to place this information within 
   another information element such as the interface switching 
   capability descriptor (ISCD). Consult routing protocol specific 
   extensions for details of placement of information elements. 

   7.2. Dynamic Node Information (WSON Specific) 

   Currently the only node information that can be considered dynamic 
   is the resource pool state and can be isolated into a dynamic node 
   information element as follows:  

   <DynamicNodeInfo> ::=  <NodeID> [<ResourcePoolState>]

8. Security Considerations 

   This document discussed an information model for RWA computation in 
   WSONs. Such a model is very similar from a security standpoint of 
   the information that can be currently conveyed via GMPLS routing 
   protocols.  Such information includes network topology, link state 
   and current utilization, and well as the capabilities of switches 
   and routers within the network.  As such this information should be 
   protected from disclosure to unintended recipients.  In addition, 
   the intentional modification of this information can significantly 
   affect network operations, particularly due to the large capacity of 
   the optical infrastructure to be controlled. 

    

9. IANA Considerations 

   This informational document does not make any requests for IANA 
   action.
