                     Balanced Security for IPv6 CPE
            draft-v6ops-vyncke-balanced-ipv6-security-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes how an IPv6 residential Customer Premise
   Equipment (CPE) can have a balanced security policy that allows for a
   mostly end-to-end connectivity while keeping the major threats
   outside of the home.  It is based on an actual IPv6 deployment by
   Swisscom and proposes to allow all packets inbound/outbound EXCEPT
   for some layer-4 ports where attacks and vulnerabilities (such as
   weak passwords) are well-known.

Internet-Draft           Balanced-CPEv6-security            January 2013


1.  Introduction

   Internet access in residential IPv4 deployments generally consist of
   a single IPv4 address provided by the service provider for each home.
   Residential CPE then translates the single address into multiple
   private IPv4 addresses allowing more than one device in the home, but
   at the cost of losing end-to-end reachability.  IPv6 allows all
   devices to have a unique, global, IP address, restoring end-to-end
   reachability directly between any device.  Such reachability is very
   powerful for ubiquitous global connectivity, and is often heralded as
   one of the significant advantages to IPv6 over IPv4.  Despite this,
   concern about exposure to inbound packets from the IPv6 Internet
   (which would otherwise be dropped by the address translation function
   if they had been sent from the IPv4 Internet) remain.  This document
   describes firewall functionality for an IPv6 CPE which departs from
   the "simple security" model described in [RFC6092] .  The intention
   is to provide an example of a security model which allows most
   traffic, including incoming unsolicited packets and connections, to
   traverse the CPE unless the CPE identifies the traffic as potentially
   harmful based on a set of rules.  This model has been deployed
   successfully in Switzerland by Swisscom without any known security
   incident.

   This document is applicable to off-the-shelves CPE as well to managed
   Service Provider CPE.


2.  Threats

   For a typical residential network connected to the Internet over a
   broadband connection, the threats can be classified into:

   o  denial of service by packet flooding:  overwhelming either the
      access bandwidth or the bandwidth of a slower link in the
      residential network (like a slow home automation network) or the
      CPU power of a slow IPv6 host (like networked thermostat or any
      other sensor type nodes);

   o  denial of service by Neighbor Discovery cache exhaustion
      [RFC6583]:  the outside attacker floods the inside prefix(es) with
      packets with a random destination address forcing the CPE to
      exhaust its memory and its CPU in useless Neighbor Sollicitations;

   o  denial of service by service requests:  like sending print jobs
      from the Internet to an ink jet printer until the ink cartridge is
      empty or like filing some file server with junk data;

   o  unauthorized use of services:  like accessing a webcam or a file
      server which are open to anonymous access within the residential
      network but should not be accessed from outside of the home
      network or accessing to remote desktop or SSH with weak password
      protection;

   o  exploiting a vulnerability in the host in order to get access to
      data or to execute some arbitrary code in the attacked host such
      as several against old versions of Windows;

   o  trojanized host (belonging to a Botnet) can communicate via a
      covert channel to its master and launch attacks to Internet
      targets.


3.  Overview

   The basic goal is to provide a fixed security policy which aims to
   block known harmful traffic and allow the rest, restoring as much of
   end-to-end communication as possible.

3.1.  Rules for Balanced Security Policy

   These are an example set of generic rules to be applied.  Each would
   normally be configurable, either by the user directly or on behalf of
   the user by a subscription service.

   If we name all nodes on the residential side of the CPE as 'inside'
   and all nodes on the Internet as 'outside', and any packet sent from
   outside to inside as being 'inbound' and 'outbound' in the other
   direction, then the behavior of the CPE is described by a small set
   or rules:

   1.  Rule RejectBogon:  apply ingress filtering in both directions per
       [RFC3704] and [RFC2827] for example with unicast reverse path
       forwarding (uRPF) checks (anti-spoofing) for all inbound and
       outbound traffic (implicitly blocking link-local and ULA in the
       same shot), this is basically the Section 2.1 Basic Sanitation
       and Section 3.1 Stateless Filters of [RFC6092];

   2.  Rule ProtectWeakServices:  drop all inbound and outbound packets
       whose layer-4 destination is part of a limited set (see
       Section 3.2), the intent is to protect against the most common
       unauthorized access and avoid propagation of worms (even if the
       latter is questionable in IPv6); an advanced residential user
       should be able to modify this pre-defined list;

   3.  Rule Openess:  allow all unsolicited inbound packets with rate
       limiting the initial packet of a new connection (such as TCP SYN,
       SCTP INIT or DCCP-request not applicable to UDP) to provide very
       basic protection against SYN port and address scanning attacks.
       All transport protocols and all non-deprecated extension headers
       are accepted.  This a the major deviation from REC-11, REC-17 and
       REC-33 of [RFC6092].

   4.  All requirements of [RFC6092] except REC-11, REC-18 and REC-33
       must be supported.

3.2.  Rules example for Layer-4 Protection as Used by Swisscom

   The rule ProtectWeakService can be implemented by using the following
   suggestions as implemented by Swisscom in 2013:

         +-----------+------+-----------------------------------+
         | Transport | Port |            Description            |
         +-----------+------+-----------------------------------+
         |    tcp    |  22  |         Secure Shell (SSH)        |
         |    tcp    |  23  |               Telnet              |
         |    tcp    |  80  |                HTTP               |
         |    tcp    | 3389 | Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol |
         |    tcp    | 5900 |    VNC remote desktop protocol    |
         +-----------+------+-----------------------------------+

         +-----------+------+-----------------------------------+
         | Transport | Port |            Description            |
         +-----------+------+-----------------------------------+
         |  tcp-udp  |  88  |              Kerberos             |
         |    tcp    |  111 |     SUN Remote Procedure Call     |
         |    tcp    |  135 |      MS Remote Procedure Call     |
         |    tcp    |  139 |      NetBIOS Session Service      |
         |    tcp    |  445 |    Microsoft SMB Domain Server    |
         |    tcp    |  513 |            Remote Login           |
         |    tcp    |  514 |            Remote Shell           |
         |    tcp    |  548 |   Apple Filing Protocol over TCP  |
         |    tcp    |  631 |     Internet Printing Protocol    |
         |    udp    | 1900 | Simple Service Discovery Protocol |
         |    tcp    | 2869 | Simple Service Discovery Protocol |
         |    udp    | 3702 |   Web Services Dynamic Discovery  |
         |    udp    | 5353 |           Multicast DNS           |
         |    udp    | 5355 |   Link-Lcl Mcast Name Resolution  |
         +-----------+------+-----------------------------------+

   This list should evolve with the time as new protocols and new
   threats appear, [DSHIELD] is used by Swisscom to keep those filters
   up to date.  Another source of information could be the appendix A of
   [TR124].  The above proposal does not block GRE tunnels ([RFC2473])
   so this is a deviation from [RFC6092].

   Note:  the authors believe that with this set the usual residential
   subscriber, the proverbial grand-ma, is protected.  Of course,
   technical susbcribers should be able to open other applications
   through their CPE through some kind of user interface.


4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no extra IANA consideration for this document.


5.  Security Considerations

   The authors of the documents believe and the Swisscom deployment
   shows that the following attack are mostly stopped:

   o  Unauthorized access because vulnerable ports are blocked

   This proposal cannot help with the following attacks:

   o  Flooding of the CPE access link;

   o  Malware which is fetched by inside hosts on a hostile web site
      (which is in 2012 the majority of infection sources).
