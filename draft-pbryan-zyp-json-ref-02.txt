Internet-Draft               JSON Reference                   March 2012


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a JSON [RFC4627] structure which allows a
   JSON value to reference another JSON value in a JSON document.  This
   provides the basis for transclusion in JSON: the use of a target
   resource as an effective substitute for the reference.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Syntax

   A JSON Reference is a JSON object, which contains a member named
   "$ref", which has a JSON string value.  Example:

   { "$ref": "http://example.com/example.json#/foo/bar" }

   If a JSON value does not have these characteristics, then it SHOULD
   NOT be interpreted as a JSON Reference.

   The "$ref" string value contains a URI [RFC3986], which identifies
   the location of the JSON value being referenced.  It is an error
   condition if the string value does not conform to URI syntax rules.
   Any members other than "$ref" in a JSON Reference object SHALL be
   ignored.


4.  Resolution

   Resolution of a JSON Reference object SHOULD yield the referenced
   JSON value.  Implementations MAY choose to replace the reference with
   the referenced value.

   If the URI contained in the JSON Reference value is a relative URI,
   then the base URI resolution MUST be calculated according to
   [RFC3986], section 5.2.  Resolution is performed relative to the
   referring document.

   If a URI contains a fragment identifier, then the fragment should be
   resolved per the fragment resolution mechansim of the referrant
   document.  If the representation of the referrant document is JSON,
   then the fragment identifier SHOULD be interpreted as a
   [JSON-Pointer].

5.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Reference
   SHOULD fail to complete.


6.  Media Type

   Documents that use JSON Reference SHOULD include a media type
   parameter: application/json; profile=http://json-schema.org/json-ref
   or refer to a schema that extends http://json-schema.org/json-ref.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft includes no request to IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   A JSON Reference is not guaranteed to resolve to a JSON value.
   Implementations of this specification SHOULD take appropriate
   precautions.

   Documents containing JSON References can be structured to resolve
   cyclically.  Implementations SHOULD include appropriate checks to
   prevent such structures from resulting in infinite recursion or
   iteration.
