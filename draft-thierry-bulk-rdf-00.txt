Internet-Draft                  BULK-RDF                     August 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Literal numerical values are provided in decimal or hexadecimal as
   appropriate.  Hexadecimal literals are prefixed with "0x" to
   distinguish them from decimal literals.

   BULK bytes sequences and expressions are described with the same
   conventions than used in the BULK 1.0 specification [BULK1]

2.  BULK RDF namespace

   The RDF namespace is an official namespace identified by the UUID
   <urn:uuid:ed460331-a89b-5742-a8de-907dff727779> (BULK,
   "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#").  Its first purpose is
   to serialize both RDF ontologies and graphs, but as RDF is deeply
   rooted in the World Wide Web and the REST architecture, some of the
   names and forms defined in this specification are intended to be used
   in applications related to those.

   This specification defines the type "URIString", which is an array
   whose content is a string conforming to the "URI-reference"
   production in [RFC3986] (section 4.1).

2.1.  URI reference

   name  "0x1" (mnemonic: "uriref" )

   shape  "( uriref URIString )"

   This form makes it possible to differentiate a string containing a
   URI from a URI reference itself.

   Type: "URIRef"

2.2.  Base URI

   name  "0x2" (mnemonic: "base" )

   shape  "( base URIString )"

   This form changes the current base URI for URI resolution.  If the
   given URI is relative, it must be resolved with the current base URI.

Internet-Draft                  BULK-RDF                     August 2013


2.3.  URI prefix

   name  "0x3" (mnemonic: "prefix" )

   shape  "( prefix {uri} )"

   Name's type  EagerFunction

   Form's type  EagerFunction

   Form's value  a function that returns a URIRef whose content is the
      concatenation of {uri} and its only argument (or returns {uri} if
      called without arguments)

   {uri} can be of type "URIString" or "URIRef".  If it is of type
   URIRef, the above description should be taken as if the form is of
   shape "( prefix ( uriref {uri} ) )".

2.4.  blank

   name  "0x4" (mnemonic: "blank" )

   shape  "( blank )"

   Name's type  EagerFunction

   Form's type  Expr

   Form's value  a new blank node.  If a same blank node must be used in
      several forms, it should be made the value of a name.

2.5.  RDF literals

   Literals are arbitrary data that can be an object in an RDF triple.
   It is important to note that their BULK serialization doesn't need to
   denote the string of their lexical form.

   Any array used as object in an RDF triple has the semantics of a
   plain literal without language tag.

2.5.1.  Plain literal

   name  "0x5" (mnemonic: "plain" )

   shape  "( plain {lang}:Array {literal}:Array )"

   This is a plain RDF literal. {lang} is the language tag.

2.5.2.  Typed literal

   name  "0x6" (mnemonic: "type" )

   shape  "( type {id}:URIRef {literal} )"

   This is a typed RDF literal. {id} is the datatype URI.  Each type
   defines what is legal as "{literal}".

2.5.3.  XMLLiteral

   name  "0x7" (mnemonic: "xmlliteral" )

   value  "( uriref
      "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral" )"

   A literal with this type SHOULD contain a BULK serialization of XML
   (cf. [BULK-XML]).  An application MUST NOT use an array for this
   literal for anyhting else than a string that belongs to the lexical
   space defined for
   <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral>.

2.6.  Triples

   name  "0x8" (mnemonic: "triples" )

   shape  "( triples {triples} )"

   "{triples}" must be a sequence of "( {subj}:URIRef {pred}:URIRef
   {obj} )".

2.7.  Turtle-like statements

   name  "0x9" (mnemonic: "turtle" )

   shape  "( turtle {statements} )"

   "{statements}" MUST be a sequnce of "( {subj}:URIRef {preds} )",
   where "{preds}" MUST be a sequence of "( {pred}:URIRef {objs} )",
   where "{objs}" is a sequence.

2.8.  RDF vocabulary

   The following names are associated with "uriref" forms, with a base
   URI of <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.  Their mnemonic
   is the lowercased URI reference.

   0xA  type

   0xB  Property

   0xC  Statement

   0xD  subject

   0xE  predicate

   0xF  object

   0x10  Bag

   0x11  Seq

   0x12  Alt

   0x13  value

   0x14  List

   0x15  nil

   0x16  first

   0x17  rest

   0x18  PlainLiteral

2.9.  RDF embedding

   name  "0x20" (mnemonic: "this-resource" )

   shape  "this-resource"

   This expression is intended to help embedding RDF metadata alongside
   or within a resource.  It has the semantics of a blank node that
   designates this resource.  What makes a resource the current
   described resource is application-dependent.
