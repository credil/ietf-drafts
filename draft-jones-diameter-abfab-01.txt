   The Diameter 'Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web
                          (ABFAB)' Application
                   draft-jones-diameter-abfab-01.txt

Abstract

   The Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB)
   architecture provides cross-domain authentication, authorization and
   accounting functionality by utilizing well-established technologies,
   such as Diameter, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and
   the Generic Security Services API (GSS-API).

   This document defines a Diameter application for usage with the ABFAB
   architecture to convey authentication information, and authorization
   decisions from the Diameter server (acting as the identity provider)
   to the Diameter client (acting as a relying party) encoded in a
   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) encoding.

Internet-Draft         Diameter ABFAB Application             March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB)
   architecture [I-D.ietf-abfab-arch] provides cross-domain
   authentication, authorization and accounting functionality by
   utilizing well-established technologies, such as Diameter, the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and the Generic Security
   Services API (GSS-API).

   The steps taken generally in an ABFAB federated authentication/
   authorization exchange are as follows:

   1.   Principal provides NAI to Application: Somehow the client is
        configured with at least the realm portion of an NAI, which
        represents the IdP to be discovered.

   2.   Authentication mechanism selection: this is the step necessary
        to indicate that the GSS-EAP SASL/GS2 mechanism will be used for
        authentication/authorization.

   3.   Client Application provides NAI to RP: At the conclusion of
        mechanism selection the NAI must be provided to the RP for
        discovery.

   4.   Discovery of federated IdP: This is discussed in detail below.
        Either the RP is configured with authorized IdPs, or it makes
        use of a federation proxy.

   5.   Request from Relying Party to IdP: Once the RP knows who the IdP
        is, it or its agent will forward RADIUS request that
        encapsulates a GSS/EAP access request to an IdP.  This may or
        may not contain a SAML request as a series of attributes.  At
        this stage, the RP will likely have no idea who the principal
        is.  The RP claims its identity to the IdP in AAA attributes,
        and it makes whatever SAML Attribute Requests through a AAA
        attribute.

   6.   IdP informs the principal of which EAP method to use: The
        available and appropriate methods are discussed below in this
        memo.

   7.   A bunch of EAP messages happen between the endpoints: Messages
        are exchanged between the principal and the IdP until a result
        is determined.  The number and content of those messages will
        depend on the EAP method.  If the IdP is unable to authenticate
        the principal, the process concludes here.  As part of this
        process, the principal will, under protection of EAP, assert the
        identity of the RP to which it intends to authenticate.

Internet-Draft         Diameter ABFAB Application             March 2012


   8.   Successful Authentication: At the very least the IdP (its EAP
        server) and EAP peer / subject have authenticated one another.
        As a result of this step, the subject and the IdP hold two
        cryptographic keys- a Master Session Key (MSK), and an Extended
        MSK (EMSK).  If the asserted identity of the RP by the principal
        matches the identity the RP itself asserted, there is some
        confidence that the RP is now authenticated to the IdP.

   9.   Local IdP Policy Check: At this stage, the IdP checks local
        policy to determine whether the RP and subject are authorized
        for a given transaction/service, and if so, what if any,
        attributes will be released to the RP.  Additional policy checks
        will likely have been made earlier just through the process of
        discovery.

   10.  Response from the IdP to the Relying Party: Once the IdP has
        made a determination of whether and how to authenticate or
        authorize the principal to the RP, it returns either a negative
        AAA result to the RP, or it returns a positive result to the RP,
        along with an optional set of AAA attributes associated with the
        principal that could include one or more SAML assertions.  In
        addition, an EAP MSK is returned to the subject.

   11.  RP Processes Results.  When the RP receives the result from the
        IdP, it should have enough information to either grant or refuse
        a resource access request.  It may have information that leads
        it to make additional attribute queries.  It may have
        information that associates the principal with specific
        authorization identies.  It will apply these results in an
        application-specific way.

   12.  RP returns results to principal: Once the RP has a response it
        must inform the client application of the result.  If all has
        gone well, all are authenticated, and the application proceeds
        with appropriate authorization levels.

   The involved entities are shown in Figure 1.

4.1.  Session Management

   The Diameter server may maintain state or may be stateless.  This is
   indicated in the Auth-Session-State AVP (or its absence).  The
   Diameter client MUST support the Authorization Session State Machine
   defined in [RFC3588].

4.1.1.  Session-Termination-Request

   The Session-Termination-Request (STR) message [RFC3588] is sent by
   the Diameter client to inform the Diameter server that an authorized
   session is being terminated.

4.1.2.  Session-Termination-Answer

   The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the
   Diameter server to acknowledge the notification that the session has
   been terminated.

4.1.3.  Abort-Session-Request

   The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message [RFC3588] is sent by the
   Diameter server to the Diameter client to terminate the authorized
   session.  When the Diameter client receives the ASR message, it MUST
   take further actions to terminate the established application
   context.

4.1.4.  Abort-Session-Answer

   The Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the Home
   Agent in response to an ASR message.

4.2.  Accounting for ABFAB services

   The Diameter client collects accounting records needed for service
   control and charging MUST support the accounting procedures and the
   Accounting Session State Machine as defined in [RFC3588].

   The Diameter application design guideline
   [I-D.ietf-dime-app-design-guide] defines two separate models for
   accounting:

   Split accounting model:

      According to this model, the accounting messages use the Diameter
      Base Accounting Application Identifier (value of 3).  Since
      accounting is treated as an independent application, accounting
      commands may be routed separately from the rest of application
      messages and thus the accounting messages generally end up in a
      central accounting server.  Since the Diameter ABFAB application
      does not define its own unique accounting commands, this is the
      preferred choice, since it permits use of centralized accounting
      for several applications.

Internet-Draft         Diameter ABFAB Application             March 2012


   Coupled accounting model:

      In this model, the accounting messages will use the ABFAB
      Application Identifiers.  This means that accounting messages will
      be routed like any other Diameter ABFAB application messages.
      This requires the Diameter server in charge of the Diameter ABFAB
      application to handle the accounting records (e.g., sends them to
      a proper accounting server).

   As mentioned above, the preferred choice is to use the split
   accounting model and thus to choose Diameter Base Accounting
   Application Identifier (value of 3) for accounting messages.

4.2.1.  Accounting-Request

   The Accounting-Request command [RFC3588] is sent by the Diameter
   client to the Diameter server to exchange accounting information.

4.2.2.  Accounting-Answer

   The Accounting-Answer command [RFC3588] is sent by the Diameter
   server to the Diameter client to acknowledge an Accounting-Request.

5.  Command Codes

   The Diameter ABFAB application defined in this document reuses the
   Diameter EAP application [RFC4072] commands: Diameter-EAP-Request
   (DER) and Diameter-EAP-Answer (DEA).  This specification extends the
   existing DER and DEA command ABNFs to offer the necessary ABFAB
   functionality.  Other than new additional AVPs and the corresponding
   additions to the command ABNFs, the Diameter EAP application command
   ABNFs remain unchanged.  The ABNF language is defined in [RFC3588].

5.1.  Diameter-EAP-Request

   The Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message, indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to 268 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field, is
   sent by the Diameter client to the Diameter server to initiate a
   Diameter ABFAB authentication and authorization procedure.  The
   Application-ID field of the Diameter Header MUST be set to the
   Diameter ABFAB Application ID (value of TDB).

   The SAML-AuthnRequest AVP is only included in the first DER message
   send by the Diameter client.  The user is both authenticated and
   during the EAP method authentication.  Authorization happens
   immediately after the authentication procedure has been completed.
   Thus, the Auth-Request-Type AVP MUST be set to the value
   AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE.

5.2.  Diameter-EAP-Answer

   The Diameter-EAP-Answer (DEA) message, indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to 268 and 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field, is
   sent in response to the Diameter-EAP-Request message (DER).  The
   Application-Id field in the Diameter message header MUST be set to
   the Diameter ABFAB Application-Id (value of TBD).


   <Diameter-EAP-Answer> ::= < Diameter Header: 268, PXY >
                             < Session-Id >
                             { Auth-Application-Id }
                             { Auth-Request-Type }
                             { Result-Code }
                             { Origin-Host }
                             { Origin-Realm }
                             [ User-Name ]
                             [ EAP-Payload ]
                             [ EAP-Reissued-Payload ]
                             [ EAP-Master-Session-Key ]
                             [ EAP-Key-Name ]
                             [ Multi-Round-Time ]
                             ...
                             [ SAML-AuthnResponse ]
                             [ SAML-Assertion ]
                             ...
                           * [ AVP ]

   SAML related attributes are only included in the final message
   exchange.  Either the SAML-AuthnResponse AVP is included in the
   response or a SAML-Assertion but not both.

                  AVPs for the Diameter ABFAB Application

   [Editor's Note: SAML encryption requirements are FFS.  The "MAY Encr"
   column in the above table refers to XML-Enc rather than the defunct
   Diameter AVP encryption.]

   The SAML-Assertion AVP contains the UTF8String encoded SAML
   assertion.

   The SAML-AuthnRequest AVP contains the UTF8String encoded SAML
   AuthnRequest message.

   The SAML-AuthnResponse AVP contains the UTF8String encoded SAML
   AuthnResponse message.

8.  AVP Occurrence Tables

   The following tables present the AVPs defined in this document and
   their occurrences in Diameter messages.

   The table uses the following symbols:

   0:

      The AVP MUST NOT be present in the message.


   0+:

      Zero or more instances of the AVP MAY be present in the message.


   0-1:

      Zero or one instance of the AVP MAY be present in the message.


   1:

      One instance of the AVP MUST be present in the message.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the namespaces that have either been created in
   this specification or had their values assigned to existing
   namespaces managed by IANA.

9.1.  AVP Codes

   This specification requires IANA to register the following new AVPs
   from the AVP Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].


   o  SAML-Assertion

   o  SAML-AuthnRequest

   o  SAML-AuthnResponse


   The AVPs are defined in Section 8.

9.2.  Application Identifier

   This specification requires IANA to allocate a new application ID
   from the Application Identifier namespace defined in [RFC3588].


   Application Identifier             | Value
   -----------------------------------+------
   Diameter ABFAB (ABFAB)             | TBD
