    Abstract 

       Dual-Stack Lite, combining IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel and Carrier Grade NAT 
       technologies, provides an approach that offers IPv4 service via IPv6 
       network by sharing IPv4 addresses among customers during IPv6 
       transition period. Dual-stack lite, however, requires CGN to maintain 
       active NAT sessions, which means processing performance, memory size 
       and log abilities for NAT sessions should scale with number of 
       sessions of subscribers; Hence increasing in CAPEX for operators 
       would be resulted in when traffic increase. 

       This document propose the NAT offload extensions to DS-Lite, which 
       allows offloading NAT translation function from centralized network 
       side (AFTR) to distributed customer equipments (B4), thereby offering 
       a trade-off between CAPEX (e.g. less performance requirements on AFTR 
       device) and OPEX (e.g., easy and fast deployment of Dual-Stack Lite) 
       for operators. The ability of easily co-deploying with basic Dual-
       Stack Lite is essential to NAT offload extension to DS-Lite.

    Internet-Draft    Lightweight extension to DS-Lite        October 2011 
        

    1. Background 

       The basic idea of NAT offload extension to DS-lite, is to reuse the 
       basic DS-Lite infrastructure, including tunneling transport and 
       provisioning method, and ICMP and fragmentation processing as well. 

        

       The NAT offload extension makes the AFTR table scales with customer 
       number other than traffic sessions. Based on this NAT offload 
       extension, log entries for per subscriber instead of per session is 
       achievable. IPv4 address utilization efficiency depends on port 
       allocation strategies, e.g., per port on demand, or a buck of ports 
       pre-allocation, which would be elaborated in Section 5. 

       Besides, this method allows unique IPv6 address for delivery both 
       IPv4 over IPv6 traffic and native IPv6 traffic without introduce any 
       IPv4 addressing/rouging into IPv6 address/routing, as it reuses Dual 
       Stack Lite tunneling transport infrastructure, unlike stateless 
       solutions with port set allocation such as aplusp and 4rd, that 
       either requires two IPv6 addresses separately for either IPv4 traffic 
       over IPv6 or native IPv6 traffic, or require carefully design to 
       avoid introduce IPv4 routing to IPv6 routing when using unique IPv6 
       address to transport both IPv4 over IPv6 traffic and native IPv6 
       traffic.

                 Figure 1 : NAT offload extended DS-Lite Overview 

        

       NATed B4:  A NAT offload extended B4 which is called NATed B4 in this 
       document can be either an IPv6 hosts or a CPE. NATed B4 performs IP 
       address and port translation function, besides establishment of IPv4 
       in IPv6 tunnel with AFTR. 

        

       NAT offload AFTR: A NAT offload extended AFTR which is called NAT 
       offload AFTR is responsible for establishing IPv4 in IPv6 tunneling 
       with NATed B4 to transport IPv4 over IPv6 while the NAT translation 
       function is offloaded to NATed B4. 

        

       A NATed B4 uses IPv4 address with a restricted port set for this IPv4 
       connectivity, which may be provisioned via either DHCPv4 with the 
       AFTR, or via PCP with the PCP server. The AFTR keeps the mapping 
       between B4's IPv6 address, allocated IPv4 address, and a restricted 
       port set ID on a per customer basis. 

       For host NATed B4 case, the host gets public address directly. It is 
       also suggested that the host run a local NAT to map randomly 
       generated ports into the restricted port set. Private to public 
       address translation would not be needed in this NAT.  Another   
     
     
    DBC                     Expires May 31, 2012                  [Page 4] 
        
    Internet-Draft    Lightweight extension to DS-Lite        October 2011 
        

       solution is to have the IP stack to only assign ports within the   
       restricted port set to applications.  Either way the host guarantees 
       that every port number in the packets sent out by itself  falls into 
       the allocated port set. 

        

    3. NATed B4 Behavior  

       The NATed B4 is responsible for performing NAT and/ALG functions, 
       basic B4 functions, as well as supporting NAT Traversal mechanisms 
       (e.g., UPnP or NAT-PMP). 

       The tunneling provisioning of the B4 element should reuse what has 
       defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite]. 

        

    3.1. Plain IPv4 Address 

       A NATed B4 MAY be assigned with a plain IPv4 address. 

       When a plain, IPv4 address is assigned, the NAT operations are 
       enforced as per current legacy CPEs.  The NAT in the AFTR is disabled   
       for that user.IPv4 datagrams are encapsulated in IPv6 as specified in 
       [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite]. 

        

    3.2. Restricted IPv4 Address and port set provisioning 

    3.2.1. Restricted port allocation strategies and requirements 

       Restricted port allocation strategies for this approach could either 
       be allocating per port on demand, or be pre-allocating a port set (no 
       matter a continuous port range, or multiple non-continuous sub port 
       sets),which leads to trade-off between provisioning  efficiency and 
       IPv4 utilization efficiency.  

        

       Note that efficiency on log is reported by operators as a practical 
       requirement for AFTR, hence port set decoding should take this 
       requirement into account, no matter which port allocation strategy is 
       adopt.

    Internet-Draft    Lightweight extension to DS-Lite        October 2011 
        

       Unlike stateless 4over6 solutions such as  [I-D.murakami-softwire-
       4rd], the restricted port sets allocation for NAT offload extended 
       DS-Lite has no requires on careful planning of the IPv6 and IPv4 
       addressing together. It therefore offers more flexibility for ISPs, 
       when it comes to managing the IPv6 access network, and introduces no 
       impact on IPv6 routing. 

        

    3.2.2. Restricted IPv4 Address and port set provisioning method 

        

       Either DHCP for example, [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign] or PCP would be 
       candidate for delivery Restricted IPv4 and port set. 

       With PCP, The basic PCP protocol allows per port on demand allocation, 
       while an extension to PCP [I-D.tsou-pcp-natcoord] supports pre-
       allocate bulk of ports. 

        

    3.3. Outgoing Packets Processing 

       Upon receiving an IPv4 packet, the B4 performs NAT using the public 
       IPv4 address and port set assigned to it.  Then B4 encapsulates the   
       resulting IPv4 packet into an IPv6 packet, and delivers it through 
       IPv6 connectivity to AFTR which will then decapsulate the 
       encapsulated packet and forward it through IPv4.  The destination   
       IPv6 address used for encapsulation should be the AFTR's address. 

        

    3.4. Incoming Packets Processing 

       Upon receipt of IPv4-in-IPv6 packet from AFTR, B4 will decapsulate 
       the packet and translate the public IPv4 address to the private IPv4 
       address.  Finally, it delivers the packet to the host using the   
       translated IPv4 address.  The source IPv6 address used for 
       encapsulation at AFTR is the AFTR's address, and the destination 
       address is set to the external address of B4. 

    3.4.1. Incoming Ports considerations on a given restricted IPv4 address 

       As described in [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues], a bulk 
       of incoming ports can be reserved as a centralized resource shared by 
       all subscribers using a given restricted IPv4 address.  In order to 
     
     
    DBC                     Expires May 31, 2012                  [Page 6] 
        
    Internet-Draft    Lightweight extension to DS-Lite        October 2011 
        

       distribute incoming ports as fair as possible among subscribers 
       sharing a given restricted IPv4 address, other than allocating a 
       continuous range of ports to each, a solution to distribute bulks of 
       non-continuous ports among subscribers, which also takes port 
       randomization into account, is elaborated in Section 3.1. 

        

    4. NAT offload AFTR Behaviour 

        

       The NAT offload AFTR may be co-located with IP and /or restricted 
       port set allocation server (e.g., a DHCP server, or a PCP server). 

       The AFTR only maintains a static mapping entry per customer consist 
       of IPv6 address, IPv4 address and port set ID, other than maintains 
       NAT entries per session.  

        

    4.1. Outgoing Packets Processing 

       For outgoing packets, the NAT offload AFTR simply decapsulates it and 
       forwards it to IPv4 Internet. 

        

    4.2. Incoming Packets Processing 

       For inbound traffic, NAT offload AFTR would use the IPv4 destination 
       address and port as the index to retrieve mapping table in order to 
       find a destination IPv6 address, and then encapsulates it into IPv6, 
       so that native IPv6 routing could be used to forward the IPv4 in IPv6 
       traffic.   

        

    5. Fragmentation and Reassembly and DNS 

       No change to Section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite. The 
       DNS behavior is the same as described in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-
       stack-lite].

    6.  Security Considerations 

        

       As port randomization is one protection among others against blind 
       attacks, a simple non-contiguous port sets distribution mechanism is   
       therefore proposed to distribute bulks of non-continuous ports among   
       subscribers, and to enable subscribers operating port randomized NAT. 

       In this section, a non-continuous restricted port set 
       encoding/decoding and an algorithm of random ephemeral port selection 
       within the allocated restricted port set example proves that port 
       randomization is applicable this approach. 

       On every external IPv4 address, according to port set size N, log2(N)   
       bits are randomly choosing by NAT offload AFTR as subscribers 
       identification bits(s bit) among 1st and 16th bits. Take a sharing 
       ration 1:32 for example, Figure 1 shows an example of 5 random 
       selected bits of s bits. 

        
                        |1st |2nd |3rd |4th |5th |6th |7th | 8th| 
                        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ 
                        | 0  |  s | 0  | 0  | s  | 0  | s  |  0 | 
                        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ 
                        |9th |10th|11th|12th|13th|14th|15th|16th| 
                        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ 
                        | s  | 0  |  s | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 
                        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ 
        

           Figure 2 : A s bit selection example (on a sharing ration 1:32 
                                    address). 

        

       Subscriber ID pattern is formed by setting all the s bits to 1 and 
       other trivial bits to 0.  Figure 2 illustrates an example of 
       subscriber ID pattern on a sharing ration 1:32 address.  Note that 
       the subscriber ID pattern will be different, guaranteed by the random   
       s bit selection, on every restricted IP address no matter whether the   
       sharing ratio varies.The NAT offload AFTR can use subscriber ID 
       pattern as port set ID on a per restricted IPv4 address basis, which 
       allows log entries scale on a subscriber basis, hence meets the log 
       efficiency requirements described in Section 3.1.2.

       Subscriber ID pattern and subscriber ID value together uniquely 
       defines a non-overlapping port set on a restricted IP address. 

       Pseudo-code shown in the Figure 4 describe how to use subscriber ID   
       pattern and subscriber ID value to implement a random ephemeral port   
       selection function in a restricted port set.

    Appendix A. Variants of this approach  

       A.1. Introduction 

       This section defines variants of deployment for this NAT offload DS-
       Lite approach. A.2 describes its combination with stateless 
       encapsulation. 

       A.2 Stateless Encapsulation 

       B4 may implement the stateless encapsulation specified in Section 4.4 
       of [I-D.ymbk-aplusp].
