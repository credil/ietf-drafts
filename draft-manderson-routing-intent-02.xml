<section title="Requirements Notation">
  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
  described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">

<t>The IANA address registries currently do not have a uniform and consistent nomenclature to signal if an allocation is intended to 
be publicly routed. While some registries, such as the <xref target="RFC5736">IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry</xref>, include a column describing 
routing scope it is the exception. The consequence of this is that at present the intended routing 
posture of many allocations is, at best, implied.</t>

<t>Work is underway in the IETF to design and document a number of systems or architectures to facilitate the desire to secure
the Internet routing system. <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-arch"></xref> describes one such architecture. Such work will require an explicit 
statement as to the intended public routability of an allocation. Over time several architectures may come
to exist, and in support of the idea of routing security, this document provides direction to IANA to mark existing and future IANA 
IPv4 <xref target="RFC0791"></xref> and IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"></xref> allocations with generic terms pertaining to the Public 
(global) Routing Intent (PRI) and with a granularity that removes any possible ambiguity in interpreting the address registry.</t>

<t>These well defined generic terms can then be applied in technology solutions that address routing security, or other routing concerns.</t>
	
</section>


<section title="Definitions">

<t>Publically Routed: Where the announcement of a prefix contained within, or representing, an allocation is exchanged between 2 or more 
	Autonomous Systems that do not share a common and unified routing policy except for the announcement
and acceptance of routes containing a prefix directly allocated to themselves.</t>
	
<t>Routable: An IPv4 <xref target="RFC0791"></xref> or IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"></xref> prefix that is intended to be (publicly) routed.</t>


<t>Not Routable: An IPv4 <xref target="RFC0791"></xref> or IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"></xref> prefix that is NOT intended to be (publicly) routed.</t>


</section>

<section title="Wording for future IETF Documents">
<t>All future IETF documents that request IANA <xref target="RFC5226"></xref> to allocate, assign, or reserve an IPv4 <xref target="RFC0791"></xref> or IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"></xref> address 
block MUST include a statement for each and every unique prefix it requests that describes the routing intent for the prefix. Suitable examples are: 
</t>

<figure><artwork>
<![CDATA[
1) This prefix, 2001:DB8::/32, is to be considered Routable.
2) 2001:DB8::/32 is for private use and intended to be Not Routable.
3) The assignment of 2001:DB8::/32 is intended to be Routable.

<section title="Special Address Registries">
<t>The <xref target="RFC5736">IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry</xref> already contains a routing scope definition.
While this registry is the exception for address registries, the PRI column MUST be added to the IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry leaving 
the existing Routing Scope in place for additional information to the reader.</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This document directs IANA to extend all the IPv4 and IPv6 address registries to record Public Routing Intent (PRI) as either "Routable" or "Not Routable". This intent 
should be initially taken from the appendices in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-iana-objects"></xref> for reserved, special use, and unallocated 
address space. Address space already allocated to the Regional Internet Registries or other entities for use on the public internet MUST be marked 
as "Routable". Future standards action IETF documents that request action in all IANA IPv4 or IPv6 addresses registries MUST include a statement 
pertaining to the routing intent of the resulting action as described in this document.</t>

<t>Implementation of this document further requires IANA to update the IPv4 and IPv6 address registries to use a granularity commensurate with the most 
	specific entry in the address registry. An example registry can be found in Appendix <xref target="appenA">A</xref>.</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>This document does not alter the security profile for IANA IPv4 <xref target="RFC0791"></xref> or IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"></xref> address registries.
