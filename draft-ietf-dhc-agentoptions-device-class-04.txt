This document proposes a new sub-option to the DHCP (Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol) Relay Agent Information Option.  This new
sub-option is for use with DOCSIS (Data-Over-Cable Service Interface
Specifications) cable modems and describes a "device class" to which
the cable modem belongs.  The cable modem signals its device class
information to the Relay Agent using DOCSIS signaling, and the Relay
Agent forwards the device class information to the DHCP Server which
can then make a policy decision based on it.

This document is a product of the Dynamic Host Configuration Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state and
status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
