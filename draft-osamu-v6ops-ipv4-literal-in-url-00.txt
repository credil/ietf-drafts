Abstract

   In an IPv6-only environment with DNS64/NAT64 based translation
   service, there is no way to get access a URL whose domain name part
   includes an IPv4 address literal.  This memo discusses a few methods
   to rewrite the URL on an IPv6-only host so that the URL is accessible
   from the IPv6-only host.

1.  Introduction and Overview

   When a host in an IPv6 only environment (an IPv6-only host) has to
   access an IPv4-only destination, a translator-based approach is a
   powerful tool.  The translator-based approach is usually composed of
   a DNS64 server [RFC6147] and a stateful NAT64 translator [RFC6146].
   The DNS64 server responds with an AAAA record of an IPv4 embedded
   IPv6 address with significant IPv6 prefix assigned to the NAT64
   translator.  The IPv6-only host sends an IPv6 packet, which is
   translated by the NAT64 box to an IPv4 packet.  The translation of
   responded IPv4 packet back into an IPv6 packet is also performed in
   the NAT64 translator.

   The NAT64 with DNS64 approach works well for most destinations.  It
   does not work well when the DNS response packet included NXDOMAIN or
   SERVFAIL to the AAAA query, partly described in [RFC4074].
   Resolution of this case is out of scope of this memo.

   It is legitimate to embed an IPv4 address literal in an URL such as
   follows:
       http://192.0.2.10/index.html
   In the environment described above, the destination is not accessible
   from an IPv6-only host.  This problem has already been reported in
   [RFC6586] and other experiences.

   The reason why we cannot access the destination specified by above
   notation is that no DNS lookup is performed in most cases, and no
   DNS64 service is able to tell an IPv4 embedded IPv6 address to the
   host.  To perform DNS64/NAT64 translation against such an IPv4

Internet-Draft               IPv4addr in URL                   July 2013


   address literal notation, some mechanism will be required.

   This memo proposes a special-use TLD.  We denote the special-use TLD
   as ``.TLD'' which will be replaced with actual TLD based on
   discussion in Section 3.5.  The concept of ``.TLD'' is simple; all
   IPv4 address literal notations are rewritten to ``<ipv4-address-
   literal>.TLD'' on the IPv6-only host, letting DNS servers and
   translators translate the IPv4 address literal to appropriate IP
   address on each leaf network.  For example, <ipv4-address-
   literal>.TLD in DNS64/NAT64 environment would be translated to a
   NAT64 prefix mapped address.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Scope of this memo

   Before discussing solutions, we define the scope of this memo.  We
   focus only on smooth migration to an IPv6-only environment with the
   DNS64/NAT64 solution.  Therefore, we focus on only ``IPv4 address
   literal'' problem mentioned in [RFC6586].

   The ``IPv6 address literal'' is out of scope of this memo, because an
   URL including IPv6 address literal can be accessible in IPv6-only
   networks and in dual stack networks.  The solutions to keep IPv4-only
   hosts or IPv4-only applications in IPv6 only environment are out of
   scope on this memo.


3.  A special-use TLD for IPv4 Address Literal

   When the part of IPv4 address literal is written to form a pseudo
   FQDN, the DNS64 server can return an AAAA record with the specified
   IPv4 address that is mapped to a NAT64 prefix.

   Once an AAAA record is obtained, the IPv6-only host can send an IPv6
   packet to the destination.  The IPv6 packet will be translated via
   NAT64 translator in the same way as a regular IPv4-only destination.

3.1.  The procedure in detail

   The procedure of the special-use TLD is as follows;
   o  An host internally attaches ``.TLD'' to an IPv4 address literal.
      For example, <ipv4-address-literal> is rewritten to <ipv4-address-
      literal>.TLD.




Nakamura, et al.        Expires January 11, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               IPv4addr in URL                   July 2013


   o  The host gets access to <ipv4-address-literal>.TLD instead of
      <ipv4-address-literal>.
   o  As <ipv4-address-literal>.TLD looks like a regular FQDN, the IPv6-
      only host will query the FQDN to a DNS server.
   o  The DNS server recognizes that the FQDN ``<ipv4-address-
      literal>.TLD'' is a special-use TLD.  Then,
      *  If the network is an IPv6-only network, and if the IPv6-only
         network has a DNS64 server and NAT64 translator(s), then, the
         DNS64 server SHOULD convert <ipv4-address-literal> into a NAT64
         prefix mapped address and returns the NAT64 prefix mapped
         address as an AAAA record.
      *  If the network is an IPv4-only network, then, the DNS4 server
         MAY remove ``.TLD'' and returns an A record corresponding to
         <ipv4-address-literal>.
      *  If the network is a dual stack network, and if the dual stack
         network does not have any DNS64/NAT64 function, then, DNS4
         server MAY remove ``.TLD'' and returns <ipv4-address-literal>
         as an A record.
      *  If the network is a dual stack network, and if the dual stack
         network has any DNS64/NAT64 function, then, <ipv4-address-
         literal> MAY be returned as an A record and NAT64 prefix mapped
         address MAY be returned as an AAAA record.
   o  After the name resolution procedure is completed, the host will
      access the <ipv4-address-literal> through an appropriate socket.

   This solution would not require the modification of common shared
   libraries on Operating Systems.  The DNS implementations have to
   support the special-use TLD and the procedure mentioned above.  The
   modification of NAT64 or DHCP are not required.

3.2.  Use case 1: manual use

   For example, consider living on an IPv6-only network with DNS64/
   NAT64, and receiving a message like ``please download a file foo.doc
   from a ftp server 192.0.2.10''.  Usually, you don't have any method
   to get NAT64 information.  Under the proposed mechanism, you can just
   type as follow;
       % ftp 192.0.2.10.TLD

   The packet would be transferred along with [RFC6384].

3.3.  Use case 2: browser plug-in

   An IPv4 address literal is often used in URL for the lazy DNS
   operation, a temporary HTTP server or a hidden (private) server.
   Taking into account user convenience, a browser plug-in can be
   developed that it converts the <ipv4-address-literal> on the hostname
   part of an URL to <ipv4-address-literal>.TLD.  It may suggested to

Internet-Draft               IPv4addr in URL                   July 2013


   turn this on when the host is on IPv6-only network, however, it may
   not be easy to detect it.

3.4.  Other Possible Solutions

   Several possible solutions can be considered described below,
   however, most of them would not work between considerable fraction of
   IPv6 only networks and dual stack networks.

3.4.1.  IPv4-Compatible IPv6 Address

   The literally embedded IPv4 address is converted to an IPv4-
   Compatible IPv6 address, and sent to the NAT64 converter as usual.
   This solution requires application or common shared library
   modification.

   Also, the procedure for learning about the NAT64 prefix to be used
   for a particular IPv4 destination is issued.  Looking up to some
   known IPv4-only anchor host is a possible method.  However, current
   ISC BIND DNS64 implementation can set different NAT64 prefixes to
   different IPv4 address prefixes.  Therefore, this solution would not
   work well.

3.4.2.  Advertising NAT64 prefix by DHCP or DNS

   Wing proposed a solution that advertises a NAT64 prefix by DHCP or
   DNS in [I-D.draft-wing-behave-learn-prefix-04]'' in 2009.  But this
   solution is a little complex and requires various modifications to
   DNS and DHCP implementations.  Wing's draft has already expired.

3.4.3.  Using BIH or 464XLAT CLAT on a host

   Bump in the Host (BIH) [RFC6535] and 464XLAT [RFC6877] are possible
   solutions, both of which are aimed at retaining the usage of IPv4-
   only applications in IPv6-only environment.  BIH has a local
   translator function between the socket API and the TCP/IP stack.  On
   the other hand, 464XLAT provides PLAT (Provider side XLAT) [RFC6146]
   and CLAT (Customer side XLAT) [RFC6145].  Some mobile carriers have
   started CLAT CPE on smart phones.  Therefore, some CLAT plug-in on a
   browser or CLAT CPE on a host may work.

   The BIH case requires several extensions on Operating Systems, so we
   have to wait many independent Operating System Open Source Projects
   and/or commercial Operating System vendors support BIH in their
   Operating Systems.

   In case of the 464XLAT, 464XLAT assumes that a user always uses a
   specific CLAT and PLAT pair.  If a user want to change or move



Nakamura, et al.        Expires January 11, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               IPv4addr in URL                   July 2013


   various public wi-fi networks, then, a global reachable PLAT might be
   placed and a CLAT on a host has to equip a function that switches the
   CLAT function depending on the condition of the current network.

3.5.  special-use TLD alternatives

   A few candidates of the special-use TLD is discussed here.

3.5.1.  Use of .host special TLD

   A special string ``.host'' is attached to an IPv4 address literal
   notation like ``192.0.2.10'' to form a pseudo FQDN such as
   ``192.0.2.10.host''.  Also, IPv4 address and port number literal is
   often used, for instance, ``192.0.2.10:8080'' becomes
   ``192.0.2.10.host:8080''.

3.5.2.  Use of .ip4host.arpa special TLD

   This idea is almost the same as ``.host'', but uses ``ip4host.arpa''
   top level labels rather than ``.host''.  While the pseudo FQDN is
   expected to appear only in the DNS look up by an IPv6-only host, it
   may leak to the global Internet.  In order to avoid the query to the
   Root DNS servers, use of the sub-domain of ".arpa" may be
   recommended.  The generated pseudo FQDN looks like
   ``192.0.2.10.ip4host.arpa''.

3.5.3.  Use of .dns64 special TLD

   The special-use TLD is mainly aimed to force IPv4 address literal
   notation to be translated by DNS64/NAT64 in IPv6-only environments.
   Therefore, ``.dns64'' reflects the request for DNS64/NAT64
   translation against an IPv4 address.

3.5.4.  Our recommendation

   We, authors of this memo, discussed which special-use TLD is
   suitable.  Our recommendation is to use ``.host'' from the view of
   usability.  Of course, we will accept any feedbacks from the
   community such as IETF v6ops and dnsops working groups and users
   community.


4.  Discussions

4.1.  Usages of IPv6 address literal

   The special-use TLD may be applied to IPv6 address cases in same
   ways, however, such notation is not required in dual stack / IPv6-



Nakamura, et al.        Expires January 11, 2014                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               IPv4addr in URL                   July 2013


   only environment, generally.

4.2.  Attached the special-use TLD to a regular FQDN

   Conceptually, the special-use TLD would be attached to only IPv4
   address literals, however, the special-use TLD may be attached to a
   regular FQDN notation like ``foo.bar.com.TLD''.  We propose that such
   misuses should be discarded on the DNS or applications on the host
   side.

4.3.  An embedded IP address literal in the content part of URL

   In some case, <ipv4-address-literal> may be embedded into the content
   part of a URL, however, it may be difficult for users or browser
   plug-ins to recognize unambiguously that a string like <ipv4-address-
   literal> surely means some IPv4 address.  From the point of view of
   IPv6 migration, embedded IP address literal in the content part of an
   URL MUST be avoided.

4.4.  Prevention the leak of the special-use TLD

   When the special-use TLD ``.TLD'' is actually employed in the
   operation, ``.TLD'' will leak to the public DNS infrastructure
   including root DNS servers as seen in ``.local''.  Therefore, once
   consensus is obtained, the relevant TLD SHOULD be delegated to a set
   of DNS servers.

   Two possible DNS operation methods can be considered.  One is to
   delegate the TLD to AS112 servers [as112-servers].  When one of the
   AS112 servers received a query with the special-use TLD, it returns
   with NXDOMAIN.

   The other possible DNS operation is to deploy a set of special
   purpose DNS servers which accept queries with ``.TLD'' and synthesize
   an A record corresponding to the IPv4 address in the QNAME when it is
   a legitimate IPv4 address.  Otherwise, NXDOMAIN is returned.


5.  Implementation Strategy

   It is suggested to implement the .TLD rewriting as in the following
   order:
   1.  Define .TLD
          Once the community agrees to accept the rewriting scheme
          described in this memo, it must fix the .TLD to be used.
   2.  .TLD delegation





Nakamura, et al.        Expires January 11, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               IPv4addr in URL                   July 2013


          DNS queries with .TLD can leak to the DNS of the global
          Internet, it is highly suggested to delegate .TLD to a set of
          authoritative DNS servers as discussed in Section 4.4.
   3.  DNS64 modification
          DNS64 implementation is suggested to modify to respond
          corresponding AAAA record to a query with .TLD.  This process
          can be done in parallel to the step 2 above.
   4.  Start using .TLD rewriting
          After, at least the step 2 is completed, the TLD rewriting may
          be used in manually described in Section 3.2 or automatically
          by browser plugins described in Section 3.3.
          While further discussions and observation is required, we may
          discourage to use an URL in IPv4 literal embedded.  Instead,
          we may encourage to use .TLD notation as a legitimate URL even
          in the server side.


6.  Security Considerations

   The recommendation contains security considerations related to DNS.
   At the moment, we do not consider the affinity with DNSSEC.


7.  IANA Considerations

   According to the discussion with communities, this memo may call for
   changes or additions of special-use TLD to the IANA registry.
