                IPv6 Delegated Prefix Verification Tool
                      draft-shishio-v6ops-dpvt-01

Abstract

   IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6
   (DHCP-PD) and IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) are technology to provide
   IPv6 prefix, not IPv6 address themselves.

   Delegated Prefix are controlled by Customer Premise Equipment (CPE)
   and 6rd Customer Edge (6rd CE).  The service provider can not confirm
   utilization of delegated prefix on CE and CPE.

   This document describes mechanism of verification for delegated
   prefix on CPE and CE from service provider side.

Internet-Draft     Delegated Prefix Verification Tool      February 2013


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6
   (DHCP-PD) is defined as RFC3633,IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) is
   defined as RFC5969.  Both of technologies provide IPv6 prefix to edge
   device on the access network.  Delegated edge devices are assigned
   IPv6 address to the interface from delegated prefix.

   Prefix Delegation is effective approach to assign IPv6 address
   hierarchical with scalability.  But there are some issues from
   maintenance perspective.

   -DHCP-PD server does not care interface address of CPE.

   -6rd PE does not know which CE are using 6rd delegate prefix.

   This document proposes new ICMPv6 type to verify delegated prefix on
   CPE and CE.


2.  problem statement

   The stateless tunnel and prefix delegation technology provides much
   scalability network to the customer.

   On one hand, these technologies are difficult to plan additional
   capacity and hard to know current deployment status unless the
   devices are completely managed.

2.1.  6rd[RFC5969] case

   6rd[RFC5969] is automatic IPv6 over IPv4 technology.  If the operator
   provides 6rd parameter such as 6rd BR address/6rd prefix/
   prefix-length and IPv6 internet then CE always can connect without
   additional configuration for PE from 6rd domains.

   6rd is stateless technology so the PE operator can not know how many
   user already connects/configured.

2.2.  DHCP-PD[RFC3633] case

   Service provider delegates large prefix to CPE.  And CPE assigns ipv6
   prefix to the client from the delegated prefix.

   ISP does not need maintenance each of client prefix , the
   architecture provides address hierarchy, thus it can build scalable
   network.

   But if the RIR policy and address planning would be changed , ISP can
   not check how the delegated prefixes are using.


3.  Another solution

3.1.  IPFIX/Netflow

   Monitor real traffic data using by IPFIX/Netflow could analyze
   traffic to the internet on both 6rd and DHCP-PD cases.  But CPE
   internal traffic can not find.

3.2.  IPv6 Node Information Queries

   IPv6 Node Information Queries is defined RFC4620 as experimental.  It
   may resolve the problem if the RFC4620 improved as standard.

5.  packet processing

   1.  The request node make "verification request" with delegated
   prefix which are the operator would like to check.

   2.  The received node compares interface address and Delegated
   Prefix/prefix-length in the packets.

   3-a.  If the received node's interface address match the Delegated
   Prefix/prefix-length, then it contains the interface address and snmp
   ifindex in the "verification reply".

   3-b.  If the receives node's interface address does not match the
   Delegated Prefix/prefix-length, then it makes "does not match any."


6.  development consideration

   If the delegated prefix also delegates to another router.  The ISP
   can not check any even if the protocol is executed.

   IANA should assign New type and code of ICMPv6.


10.  Security Considerations

   documented in the "Security Considerations" section of RFC4443

   This protocol has potential risk, because the configuration
   information be shared by "verification reply" message.

   The nonce mechanism could avoid spoofing "verification reply"/"does
   not response".  But it is not protect from attacker.

   The implementation SHOULD be accepted from this NEW TYPE of ICMPv6
   message from only authorized node such as 6rd BR and DHCP-PD server.
