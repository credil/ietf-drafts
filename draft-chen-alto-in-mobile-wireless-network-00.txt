Abstract

   As wireless access bandwidths increase quickly, Peer-to-Peer
   applications boom in mobile and wireless network and their traffic 
   need to be optimized. This document deals with the scenario of ALTO 
   where peers are connected through mobile or wireless network, like 3G,
   LTE and WLAN access network. It proposes the requirements and

1. Introduction

   The present ALTO server can collect many properties about endpoints
   like connection type, geographical location, and others may be useful
   to applications in ALTO protocol[1]. However, the information mainly
   focuses on fixed broadband network.

   As wireless access bandwidths increase quickly, Peer-to-Peer
   applications spring up in mobile and wireless network. For example,
   they had been in top 3 of high traffic in 3G network of China Mobile
   and their traffic need to be optimized in mobile and wireless network.

   This document deals with the scenario of ALTO where peers are
   connected through wireless mobile network, like 3G, LTE and WLAN
   environments. Due to the scarcity and high dynamicity of wireless
   links, traffic optimization of mobile and wireless network is
   different from that of fixed broadband network. It proposes the
   requirements and architecture of ALTO in mobile and wireless network.

   Section 2 outlines the requirements and architecture of ALTO in
   mobile and wireless network.

2. ALTO used in Mobile and wireless Network

   This section discusses the requirements and architecture of ALTO in
   mobile and wireless network.

2.1. Requirements of ALTO in Mobile and wireless Network

   In the fixed broadband network, ALTO hopes to localize P2P traffic to
   the full extent. However, in mobile and wireless network localizing
   P2P traffic would result in the imbalance between base stations' or
   wireless access points' load due to the scarcity of wireless resource
   i.e., some base stations or wireless access points have the
   congestion so as not to provide the P2P or other data service to
   other peers or terminals in that congested base stations or wireless
   access points.

   Therefore, ALTO should optimize P2P traffic to balance the load of
   base stations or wireless access points, except and more than to
   localize P2P traffic, in mobile network like 3G, LTE and WLAN access
   environments. It means that load information of base stations and
   wireless access points is one of important properties in ALTO
   protocol of mobile and wireless environments.

   Besides, high dynamicity of topology caused by mobility and wireless
   links in mobile and wireless network results that ALTO should handle
   the network topology and link information in a shorter lifetime than
   in the fixed broadband network.

2.2. Architecture of ALTO in Mobile and wireless Network

   Figure.1 shows the enhanced ALTO architecture in mobile and wireless
   network integrating mobile and wireless network information. ALTO
   server collects the information related on mobile and wireless
   network from specific mobile information source, like Host Location
   Register and Visitor Location Register (HLR/VLR), even Policy and
   Charging Rules Function(PCRF) in Policy and Charging Control(PCC) and
   so on. ALTO client(like a peer of P2P applications) or ALTO service
   discovery elements(like P2P tracker)sends ALTO query to ALTO server
   through the ALTO protocol to obtain the prior peers evaluated by
   mobile or wireless network information of ALTO server.
