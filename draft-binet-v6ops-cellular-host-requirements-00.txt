Internet-Draft    IPv6 Requirements for Cellular Hosts     November 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3316] lists a set of features to be supported by cellular hosts
   to connect to 3GPP cellular networks.  Since the publication of that
   document, new functions have been specified within the 3GPP and the
   IETF whilst others have been updated.  Moreover, in the light of
   recent IPv6 production deployments, additional features to facilitate
   IPv6-only deployments while accessing IPv4-only service are to be
   considered.

   A detailed overview of IPv6 support in 3GPP architectures is provided
   in [RFC6459].

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC6459].

   PREFIX64 denotes an IPv6 prefix used to build IPv4-converted IPv6
   addresses [RFC6052].

1.1.  Scope

   Various types of nodes can be connected to 3GPP networks requiring
   specific functions.  Indeed, a 3GPP network can be used to connect
   user equipment such as a mobile telephone, a CPE or a machine-to-
   machine (M2M) device.  Because of this diversity of terminals, it is
   necessary to define a set of IPv6 functionalities valid for any node
   directly connecting to a 3GPP network.  This document describes these
   functionalities.

   This document is structured to initially provide the generic IPv6
   requirements which are valid for all nodes, whatever their function
   or service (e.g., SIP [RFC3261]) capability.  The document also
   contains, dedicated sections covering specific functionalities the
   specific device types must support (e.g., smartphones, devices
   providing some LAN functions (mobile CPE or broadband dongles)).

   M2M devices profile is not considered in the first version of this
   document.

   The requirements listed below are valid for both 3GPP GPRS and 3GPP
   EPS access.  For EPS, "PDN type" terminology is used instead of "PDP
   context".

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Requirements for Cellular Hosts     November 2012


   REQ#1:  The cellular host MUST support the IPv6 addressing
        architecture described in ([RFC4291]).  For address
        representation, [RFC5952] MUST be supported.

   REQ#2:  The cellular host MUST support both IPv6 and IPv4v6 PDP
        Contexts.

             This allows each operator to select their own strategy
             regarding IPv6 introduction.  Both IPv6 and IPv4v6 PDP
             contexts MUST be supported in addition to the IPv4 PDP
             context.  IPv4, IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDP-Context request
             acceptance depends on the mobile network configuration.

   REQ#3:  The cellular host MUST comply with the behavior defined in
        [TS.23060] [TS.23401] [TS.24008] for requesting a PDP context
        type.  In particular, the cellular host MUST request an IPv6 PDP
        context if the cellular host is IPv6-only and requesting an
        IPv4v6 PDP context if the cellular host is dual stack or when
        the cellular host is not aware of connectivity types requested
        by devices connected to it (e.g., cellular host with LAN
        capabilities):

        *    If the requested IPv4v6 PDP context is not supported by the
             network, but IPv4 and IPv6 PDP types are allowed, then the
             cellular host will be configured with an IPv4 address
             and/or an IPv6 prefix by the network.  It MAY initiate
             another PDP request in addition to the one already
             activated for a given APN.

        *    If the requested PDP type and subscription data allows only
             one IP address family (IPv4 or IPv6), the cellular host
             MUST NOT request a second PDP context to the same APN for
             the other IP address family.

   REQ#4:  The cellular host MUST support the PCO (Protocol
        Configuration Options) [TS.24008] to retrieve the IPv6
        address(es) of the Recursive DNS server(s).

             In-band signaling is a convenient method to inform the
             cellular host about various services, including DNS server
             information.  It does not require any specific protocol to
             be supported and it is already deployed in IPv4 cellular
             networks to convey such DNS information.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Requirements for Cellular Hosts     November 2012


   REQ#5:  The cellular host MUST support IPv6 aware Traffic Flow
        Templates (TFT) [TS.24008].

             Traffic Flow Templates are employing a Packet Filter to
             couple an IP traffic with a PDP-Context.  Thus a dedicated
             PDP-Context and radio resources can be provided by the
             mobile network for certain IP traffic.

   REQ#6:  The cellular host MUST support ICMPv6 ([RFC4443]).

             The base protocol MUST be fully implemented by every IPv6
             node as indicated in Section 2 of [RFC4443].

   REQ#7:  The device MUST support the Neighbor Discovery Protocol
        ([RFC4861] and [RFC5942]).

             In particular, MTU communication via Router Advertisement
             SHOULD be supported since many 3GPP networks do not have a
             standard MTU setting due to inconsistencies in GTP
             [RFC3314] mobility tunnel infrastructure deployments.

   REQ#8:  The cellular host MUST support IPv6 Stateless Address
        Autoconfiguration ([RFC4862]) apart from the exceptions noted in
        [TS.23060] (3G) and [TS.23401] (LTE):

             Stateless mode is the only way to configure a cellular
             host.  The GGSN must allocate a prefix that is unique
             within its scope to each primary PDP context.

             The cellular host MUST use the interface identifier sent in
             PDP Context Accept message to configure its link local
             address.  The cellular host may use a different Interface
             Identifiers to configure its global addresses.

   REQ#9:  The cellular host SHOULD support Router Advertisement Options
        [RFC6106] for DNS configuration.

             The support of this function allows for a consistent method
             of informing cellular hosts about DNS recursive servers
             across various types of access networks.  The cellular host
             SHOULD support RA-based DNS information discovery.

   REQ#10:  The cellular host SHOULD embed a DHCPv6 client [RFC3736].

             If [RFC6106] is not supported, the cellular host SHOULD
             retrieve DNS information using stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736].

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Requirements for Cellular Hosts     November 2012


             If the cellular host receives the DNS information in
             several channels for the same interface, the following
             preference order MUST be followed:
             1.   PCO
             2.   RA
             3.   DHCPv6

   REQ#11:  The cellular host SHOULD support a method to locally
        construct IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses [RFC6052].  A method to
        learn PREFIX64 SHOULD be supported by the cellular host.

             This solves the issue when applications use IPv4 referrals
             on IPv6-only access networks.

             The cellular host SHOULD implement the method specified in
             [I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic] to retrieve the
             PREFIX64.

   REQ#12:  The cellular host SHOULD implement the Customer Side
        Translator function (CLAT, [I-D.ietf-v6ops-464xlat]) function
        which is compliant with [RFC6052][RFC6145][RFC6146].

             CLAT function in the cellular host allows for IPv4-only
             application and IPv4-referals to work on an IPv6-only PDP.
             CLAT function requires a NAT64 capability [RFC6146] in the
             core network.

   REQ#13:  The cellular device SHOULD embed a DNS64 function [RFC6147].

             Local DNS64 functionality allows for compatibility with
             DNSSEC.  Means to configure or discover a PREFIX64 is also
             required on the cellular device.

   REQ#14:  The cellular host SHOULD support PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

             The support of PCP is seen as a driver to save battery
             consumption exacerbated by keepalive messages.  PCP also
             gives the possibility of enabling incoming connections to
             the user.  Indeed, because several stateful devices may be
             deployed in mobile networks (e.g., NAT and/or Firewalls),
             PCP can be used by the cellular host to control network
             based NAT and Firewall functions which will reduce per-
             application signaling and save battery consumption.

   REQ#15:  The cellular host SHOULD support means to prefer native IPv6
        connection over NAT64 devices or NAT44 when the cellular host
        gets dual stack connectivity.

             Cellular hosts SHOULD follow the procedure specified in
             [RFC6724] for source address selection.

             Some potential issues are discussed in
             [I-D.ietf-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension] for MIFed devices.

   REQ#16:  The cellular host SHOULD support the procedure defined in
        [RFC6555].

   REQ#17:  The cellular host SHOULD NOT perform Duplicate Address
        Detection (DAD) for these Global IPv6 addresses (as the GGSN or
        PDN-GW must not configure any IPv6 addresses using the prefix
        allocated to the cellular host).

   REQ#18:  The cellular device MAY embed a BIH function [RFC6535]
        facilitating the communication between an IPv4 application and
        an IPv6 server.

2.1.  WiFi Connectivity

   It is increasingly common for cellular hosts have a Wi-Fi interface
   in addition to their cellular interface.  These hosts are likely to
   be connected to private or public hotspots.  Below are listed some
   generic requirements:

   REQ#19:  IPv6 MUST be supported on the Wi-Fi interface.

   REQ#20:  DHCPv6 client SHOULD be supported on Wi-Fi interface
          ([RFC3736]).

   REQ#21:  Wi-Fi interface SHOULD support Router Advertisement Options
          for DNS configuration ([RFC6106]).


3.  Advanced Requirements

   REQ#22:  The cellular host MUST support Path MTU discovery
          ([RFC1981]).  If the MTU used by cellular hosts is larger than
          1280 bytes, they can rely on Path MTU discovery function to
          discover the real path MTU.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Requirements for Cellular Hosts     November 2012


   REQ#23:  The cellular host SHOULD support the Privacy Extensions for
          Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 ([RFC4941]).

                 The activation of privacy extension makes it more
                 difficult to track a host over time when compared to
                 using a permanent interface identifier.  [RFC4941] does
                 not require any DAD mechanism to be activated as the
                 GGSN (or PDN-GW) MUST NOT configure any global address
                 based on the prefix allocated to the cellular host.

   REQ#24:  The cellular host SHOULD support ROHC for IPv6 ([RFC5795]).

                 Bandwidth in mobile environments must be optimized as
                 much as possible.  ROHC provides a solution to reduce
                 bandwidth consumption and to reduce the impact of
                 having bigger packet headers in IPv6 compared to IPv4.

   REQ#25:  The cellular host SHOULD support IPv6 Router Advertisement
          Flags Options ([RFC5175]).

                 Some flags are used by the GGSN (or PDN-GW) to inform
                 cellular hosts about the autoconfiguration process.

   REQ#26:  The cellular host SHOULD support Router Advertisement
          extension for communicating default router preferences and
          more-specific routes as described in [RFC4191].

                 This function can be used for instance for traffic
                 offload.


4.  Cellular Devices with LAN Capabilities

   This section focuses on cellular devices (e.g., CPE, smartphones or
   dongles with tethering features) which provide IP connectivity to
   other devices connected to them.  In such case, all connected devices
   are sharing the same GPRS, UMTS or EPS connection.  In addition to
   the generic requirements listed in Section 2, these cellular devices
   have to meet the requirements listed below.

   REQ#27:  The cellular device MUST support Prefix Delegation
          capabilities [RFC3633] and MUST support Prefix Exclude Option
          for DHCPv6-based Prefix Delegation as defined in [RFC6603].
          Particularly, it MUST behave as a Requesting Router.

                 Cellular networks are more and more perceived as an
                 alternative to fixed networks for home IP-based
                 services delivery; especially with the advent of

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Requirements for Cellular Hosts     November 2012


                 smartphones and 3GPP data dongles.  There is a need for
                 an efficient mechanism to assign shorter prefix than
                 /64 to cellular hosts so that each LAN segment can get
                 its own /64 prefix and multilink subnet issues to be
                 avoided.

                 In case a prefix is delegated to a cellular host using
                 DHCPv6, the cellular device will be configured with two
                 prefixes:

                        (1) one for 3GPP link allocated using SLAAC
                        mechanism and

                        (2) another one delegated for LANs acquired
                        during Prefix Delegation operation.

                 Note that the 3GPP network architecture requires both
                 the WAN and the Delegated Prefix to be aggregatable, so
                 the subscriber can be identified using a single prefix.

                 Without the Prefix Exclude Option, the delegating
                 router (GGSN/PDN-GW) will have to ensure [RFC3633]
                 compliancy (e.g., halving the Delegated prefix and
                 assigning the WAN prefix out of the 1st half and the
                 prefix to be delegated to the terminal from the 2nd
                 half).

   REQ#28:  The cellular device MUST be compliant with the CPE
          requirements specified in [RFC6204].

   REQ#29:  Prefix delegation which allows to allocate a shorter prefix
          to a cellular host is only available since 3GPP Release 10.
          For deployments requiring to share the same /64 prefix, the
          cellular device SHOULD support [I-D.ietf-v6ops-64share] to
          enable sharing a /64 prefix between the 3GPP interface towards
          the GGSN (WAN interface) and the LAN interfaces.

   REQ#30:  The cellular device SHOULD support the Customer Side
          Translator (CLAT) [I-D.ietf-v6ops-464xlat].

                 Various IP devices are likely to be connected to
                 cellular device, acting as a CPE.  Some of these
                 devices can be dual-stack, others are IPv6-only or
                 IPv4-only.  IPv6-only connectivity for cellular device
                 does not allow IPv4-only sessions to be established for
                 hosts connected on the LAN segment of cellular devices.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 Requirements for Cellular Hosts     November 2012


                 In order to allow IPv4 sessions establishment initiated
                 from devices located on LAN segment side and target
                 IPv4 nodes, a solution consists in integrating the CLAT
                 function in the cellular device.  As elaborated in
                 Section 2, the CLAT function allows also IPv4
                 applications to continue running over an IPv6-only
                 host.

   REQ#31:  If a RA MTU is advertised from the 3GPP network, the
          cellular device SHOULD relay that upstream MTU information to
          the downstream attached LAN devices in RA.

                 Since 3GPP networks extensively use IP-in-IP/UDP GTP
                 tunnels, the effective MTU is frequently effectively
                 reduced to 1440 bytes.  While a host may generate
                 packets with an MTU of 1500 bytes, this results in
                 undesirable fragmentation of the GTP IP/UDP packets.

                 Receiving and relaying RA MTU values facilitates a more
                 harmonious functioning of the mobile core network where
                 end nodes transmit packets that do not exceed the MTU
                 size of the mobile network's GTP tunnels.


5.  APIs & Applications

   REQ#32:  Name resolution libraries MUST support both IPv4 and IPv6.

                 In particular, the cellular host MUST support
                 [RFC3596].

   REQ#33:  Applications MUST be independent of the underlying IP
          address family.

                 This means applications must be IP version agnostic.

   REQ#34:  Applications using URIs MUST follow [RFC3986].  For example,
          SIP applications MUST follow the correction defined in
          [RFC5954].


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations identified in [RFC3316] are to be taken
   into account.
