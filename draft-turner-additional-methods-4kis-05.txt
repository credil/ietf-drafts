Internet-Draft   Additional Methods For Key Identifiers     May 30, 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5280] defines the AKI (Authority Key Identifier) and SKI (Subject
   Key Identifier) certificate extensions.  These extensions allow one
   certificate to refer to another certificate via the matching of these
   corresponding values.  These identifiers enable a relying party to
   disambiguate between two CA (Certification Authority) certificates
   with the same Subject name, located in the same directory entry. 
   These identifiers are used during certification path construction in
   support of heuristics to reduce relying party workload.  These
   identifiers are not used during certificate path validation.  These
   key identifiers are used by PKI-enabled security protocols, such as
   CMP (Certificate Management Protocol) [RFC4210] and CMS
   (Cryptographic Message Syntax) [RFC5652], to identify the certificate
   used to protect a message, a session, etc.

   [RFC5280] describes two example mechanisms for generating AKI/SKI
   values: a 160-bit SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) hash of the public
   key and a four-bit type field with the value 0100 followed by the
   least significant 60 bits of the SHA-1 hash.  Both of these
   mechanisms were designed to be non-security critical.  That is, the
   use of a hash algorithm was intended to provide a high probability
   (but not a guarantee) of uniqueness.  [RFC5280] allows for additional
   mechanisms.  (This is consistent with the fact that the SKI and AKI
   extensions are always marked non-critical.)  In addition, some
   secruity protocols (e.g., SMIME [RFC5751]) as a shorthand way to
   refer to a cert.

   This document defines two additional mechanisms for generating key
   identifier values, using SHA-256 and SHA-512 [SHS]. Sample code for
   SHA-256 and SHA-512 can be found in [RFC6234]. The motivation for
   defining these additional means of generating AKI/SKI values is to
   accommodate use of additional, standard one-way hash functions that
   are becoming more widely used in PKI contexts.  Note that these
   example methods like the examples methods from [RFC5280] are designed
   to be non-security critical.  

   With these additional mechanisms, CAs can omit code for algorithms
   that are otherwise unwanted or unused.  For example, a CA that issues
   certificates hashed with SHA-256 and signed with ECDSA on the P-256
   curve [RFC5480] might no longer need to implement SHA-1 as part of
   their CA application.

   This document also specifies an extension to identify the algorithm
   used to generate the SKI.  The extension also identifies the hash
   algorithm input used to generate to the key identifier.

Internet-Draft   Additional Methods For Key Identifiers     May 30, 2012


1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


1.2.  ASN.1

   The extension is defined using ASN.1 [X.680], [X.681], [X.682], and
   [X.683].


2.  Additional Methods for Generating Key Identifiers

   As specified in [RFC5280], both authority and subject key identifiers
   SHOULD be derived from the public key.  Two additional mechanisms CAs
   can use to identify public keys are as follows:

     1) The keyIdentifier is composed of the least significant 160-bits
        of the SHA-256 hash of the value of the BIT STRING
        subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of
        unused bits).

     2) The keyIdentifier is composed of the least significant 160-bits
        of the SHA-512 hash of the value of the BIT STRING
        subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of
        unused bits).


3.  Subject Key Identifier Semantics Extension

   The SKI semantics extension indicates the hash algorithm, the hash
   algorithm input used to compute the SKI, and any semantics the issuer
   chooses to communicate via the SKI.  This allows the CA to embed
   additional semantics in to the SKI, allowing it to be used for
   purposes beyond certificate path building.  This extension MAY, at
   the option of the certificate issuer, be either critical or non-
   critical.  This extension is identified by id-pe-skiSemantics.

     ext-skiSemantics EXTENSION ::= {
       SYNTAX SKISemantics
       IDENTIFIED BY id-pe-skiSemantics }

     id-pe-skiSemantics OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe TBD }

Internet-Draft   Additional Methods For Key Identifiers     May 30, 2012


     SKISemantics ::= SEQUENCE {
       skiAlgorithm  AlgorithmIdentifier
                      { DIGEST-ALGORITHM, { SKIHashAlgs } },
       skiInput      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ( SKIInputs, ... ) OPTIONAL,
       skiOutput     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ( SKIOutputs, ... ) OPTIONAL }

     SKIHashAlgs DIGEST-ALGORITHM ::= {
       mda-sha256 | mda-sha512, ... }

     SKIInputs OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       id-subjectPublicKeyInfo, ... }

     id-subjectPublicKeyInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-tbd }

     SKIOutputs OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ... }

   SKISemantics has three fields:

     o akiAlgorithm indicates the algorithm used to generate the key
       identifier.  For example, if the CA wanted to indicate that one
       of the algorithms listed in Section 2 was used, then it would
       include OIDs (Object Identifiers) from [RFC5758].  

     o akiInput indicates the semantics for the input to the hash
       algorithm.  If this field is absent, then only the public key is
       hashed.  This document defines the OID id-subjectPublicKeyInfo to
       be used when the input to the hash algorithm is the certificate's
       SubjectPublicKeyInfo field [RFC5280].

     o skiOutput indicates the key identifier's semantics.  If this
       field is absent, then key identifier is the hash (algorithm
       identified in kiAlgorithm) of the value of the BIT STRING
       subjectPublicKey (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused
       bits).  This document defines the OID id-subjectPublicKeyInfo to
       be used when the input to the hash algorithm is the certificate's
       SubjectPublicKeyInfo field [RFC5280].  


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5280] apply to certificates.  The
   security considerations of [RFC5758] apply to the hash algorithms. 
   The security considerations of [RFC5912] apply to the ASN.1.

   While hash algorithms provide collision resistance, this property is
   not needed for key identifiers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.

   NOTE there are some OIDs that need to be registered in the PKIX Arc. 
   This will be completed later in the process.
