    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a framework comprised of a number of
      scenarios and associated requirements for pseudowire (PW) redundancy. A
      set of redundant PWs is configured between provider edge (PE) nodes in
      single segment PW applications, or between Terminating PE nodes in
      Multi-Segment PW applications. In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to
      indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding PW packets to one
      another, a new PW status is required to indicate the preferential
      forwarding status of active or standby for each PW in the redundancy
      set.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The objective of PW redundancy is to provide sparing of attachment
      circuits (ACs), Provider Edge nodes (PEs), and Pseudowires (PWs) to
      eliminate single points of failure, while ensuring that only one active
      path between a pair of Customer Edge nodes (CEs).</t>

      <t>In single-segment PW (SS-PW) applications, protection for the PW is
      provided by the Packet Switched Network (PSN) layer. This may be a
      Resource Reservation Protocol with Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) labeled
      switched path (LSP) with a fast-Reroute (FRR) backup or an end-to-end
      backup LSP. It is assumed that these mechanisms can restore PSN
      connectivity rapidly enough to avoid triggering protection by PW
      redundancy. PSN protection mechanisms cannot protect against failure of
      the a PE node or the failure of the remote AC. Typically, this is
      supported by dual-homing a Customer Edge (CE) node to different PE nodes
      which provide a pseudowire emulated service across the PSN. A set of PW
      mechanisms is therefore required that enables a primary and one or more
      backup PWs to terminate on different PE nodes.</t>

      <t>In multi-segment PW (MS-PW) applications, PSN protection mechanisms
      cannot protect against the failure of a switching PE (S-PE). A set of
      mechanisms that support the operation of a primary and one or more
      backup PWs via a different set of S-PEs is therefore required. The paths
      of these PWs are diverse in the sense that they are switched at
      different S-PE nodes.</t>

      <t>In both of these applications, PW redundancy is important to maximise
      the resiliency of the emulated service.</t>

      <t>This document describes framework for these applications and its
      associated operational requirements. The framework utilizes a new PW
      status, called the Preferential Forwarding Status of the PW. This is
      separate from the operational states defined in RFC4447 <xref
      target="RFC4447"></xref>. The mechanisms for PW redundancy are modeled
      on general protection switching principles.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Up PW: A PW which has been configured (label mapping exchanged
          between PEs) and is not in any of the PW defect states specified in
          <xref target="RFC4447"></xref>. Such a PW is is available for
          forwarding traffic.</t>

          <t>Down PW: A PW that has either not been fully configured, or has
          been configured and is in any one of the PW defect states specified
          in <xref target="RFC4447"></xref>. Such a PW is not available for
          forwarding traffic.</t>

          <t>Active PW. An UP PW used for forwarding user, OAM and control
          plane traffic.</t>

          <t>Standby PW. An UP PW that is not used for forwarding user traffic
          but may forward OAM and specific control plane traffic.</t>

          <t>PW Endpoint: A PE where a PW terminates on a point where Native
          Service Processing is performed, e.g., A Single Segment PW (SS-PW)
          PE, a Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) Terminating PE (T-PE), or a
          Hierarchical VPLS MTU-s or PE-rs.</t>

          <t>Primary PW: the PW which a PW endpoint activates (i.e. uses for
          forwarding) in preference to any other PW when more than one PW
          qualifies for active state. When the primary PW comes back up after
          a failure and qualifies for the active state, the PW endpoint always
          reverts to it. The designation of Primary is performed by local
          configuration for the PW at the PE and is only required when
          revertive behaviour is used.</t>

          <t>Secondary PW: when it qualifies for the active state, a Secondary
          PW is only selected if no Primary PW is configured or if the
          configured primary PW does not qualify for active state (e.g., is
          DOWN). By default, a PW in a redundancy PW set is considered
          secondary. There is no Revertive mechanism among secondary PWs.</t>

          <t>Revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by the
          primary PW if it is UP and a wait-to-restore timer expires and the
          primary PW is made the Active PW.</t>

          <t>Non-revertive protection switching. Traffic will be carried by
          the last PW selected as a result of previous active PW entering
          Operationally DOWN state.</t>

          <t>Manual selection of PW. The ability for the operator to manually
          select the primary/secondary PWs.</t>

          <t>MTU-s: A hierarchical virtual private LAN service Multi-Tenant
          Unit switch, as defined in RFC4762 <xref
          target="RFC4762"></xref>.</t>

          <t>PE-rs: A hierarchical virtual private LAN service switch, as
          defined in RFC4762.</t>

      <section title="PW Redundancy Network Reference Scenarios">
        <t>This section presents a set of reference scenarios for PW
        redundancy.</t>

        <section title="Single Multi-Homed CE">
          <t>The following figure illustrates an application of single segment
          pseudowire redundancy. This scenario is designed to protect the
          emulated service against a failure of one of the PEs or ACs attached
          to the multi-homed CE. Protection against failures of the PSN
          tunnels is provided using PSN mechanisms such as MPLS Fast Reroute,
          so that these failures do not impact the PW.</t>

          <t>CE1 is dual-homed to PE1 and PE3. A dual homing control protocol,
          the details of which are outside the scope of this document, selects
          which AC CE1 should use to forward towards the PSN, and which PE
          (PE1 or PE3) should forward towards CE1.</t>

            </figure>In this scenario, only one of the PWs should be used for
          forwarding between PE1 / PE3, and PE2. PW redundancy determines
          which PW to make active based on the forwarding state of the ACs so
          that only one path is available from CE1 to CE2.</t>

          <t>Consider the example where the AC from CE1 to PE1 is initially
          active and the AC from CE1 to PE3 is initially standby. PW1 is made
          active and PW2 is made standby in order to complete the path to
          CE2.</t>

          <t>On failure of the AC between CE1 and PE1, the forwarding state of
          the AC on PE3 transitions to Active. The preferential forwarding
          state of PW2 therefore needs to become active, and PW1 standby, in
          order to reestablish connectivity between CE1 and CE2. PE3 therefore
          uses PW2 to forward towards CE2, and PE2 uses PW2 instead of PW1 to
          forward towards CE1. PW redundancy in this scenario requires that
          the forwarding status of the ACs at PE1 and PE3 be signaled to PE2
          so that PE2 can choose which PW to make active.</t>

          <t>Changes occurring on the dual homed side of network due to a
          failure of the AC or PE are not propagated to the ACs on the other
          side of the network. Furthermore, failures in the PSN are not be
          propagated to the attached CEs.</t>

          <t></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Multiple Multi-Homed CEs">
          <t>This scenario, illustrated in <xref
          target="multi-multi-homed-ces"></xref>, is also designed to protect
          the emulated service against failures of the ACs and failures of the
          PEs. Here, both CEs, CE1 and CE2, are dual-homed to their respective
          PEs, PE1 and PE2, and PE3 and PE4. The method used by the CEs to
          choose which AC to use to forward traffic towards the PSN is
          determined by a dual-homing control protocol. The details of this
          protocol are outside the scope of this document.</t>

          <t>Note that the PSN tunnels are not shown in this figure for
          clarity. However, it can be assumed that each of the PWs shown is
          encapsulated in a separate PSN tunnel. Protection against failures
          of the PSN tunnels is provided using PSN mechanisms such as MPLS
          Fast Reroute, so that these failures do not impact the PW.</t>

          <t>PW1 and PW4 connect PE1 to PE3 and PE4, respectively. Similarly,
          PE2 has PW2 and PW3 connect PE2 to PE4 and PE3. PW1, PW2, PW3 and
          PW4 are all UP. In order to support N:1 or 1:1 protection, only one
          PW MUST be selected to forward traffic. This document defines an
          additional PW state that reflects this forwarding state, which is
          separate from the operational status of the PW. This is the
          &lsquo;Preferential Forwarding Status&rsquo;.</t>

          <t>If a PW has a preferential forwarding status of
          &lsquo;active&rsquo;, it can be used for forwarding traffic. The
          actual UP PW chosen by the combined set of PEs that interconnect the
          CEs is determined by considering the preferential forwarding status
          of each PW at each PE. The mechanisms for communicating the
          preferential forwarding status are outside the scope of this
          document. Only one PW is used for forwarding.</t>

          <t>The following failure scenario illustrates the operation of PW
          redundancy in Figure 2. In the initial steady state, when there are
          no failures of the ACs, one of the PWs is chosen as the active PW,
          and all others are chosen as standby. The dual-homing protocol
          between CE1 and PE1/PE2 chooses to use the AC to PE2, while the
          protocol between CE2 and PE3/PE4 chooses to use the AC to PE4.
          Therefore the PW between PE2 and PE4 is chosen as the active PW to
          complete the path between CE1 and CE2.</t>

          <t>On failure of the AC between the dual-homed CE1 and PE2, the
          preferential forwarding status of the PWs at PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4
          needs to change so as to re-establish a path from CE1 to CE2.
          Different mechanisms can be used to achieve this and these are
          beyond the scope of this document. After the change in status the
          algorithm for selection of PW needs to revaluate and select PW to
          forward traffic. In this application each dual-homing algorithm,
          i.e., {CE1, PE1, PE2} and {CE2, PE3, PE4}, selects the active AC
          independently. There is therefore a need to signal the active status
          of each AC such that the PEs can select a common active PW for
          forwarding between CE1 and CE2.</t>

          <t>Changes occurring on one side of network due to a failure of the
          AC or PE are not propagated to the ACs on the other side of the
          network. Furthermore, failures in the PSN are not be propagated to
          the attached CEs. Note that End-to-end native service protection
          switching can also be used to protect the emulated service in this
          scenario. In this case, PW3 and PW4 are not necessary.</t>

          <t>If the CEs do not perform native service protection switching,
          they may instead may use load balancing across the paths between the
          CEs.</t>

          There are three multi-segment PWs. PW1 is switched at S-PE1, PW2 is
          switched at S-PE2, and PW3 is switched at S-PE3.</t>

          <t>Since there is no multi-homing running on the ACs, the T-PE nodes
          would advertise 'Active' for the forwarding status based on a
          priority for the PW. Priorities associate meaning of 'primary PW'
          and 'secondary PW'. These priorities MUST be used in revertive mode
          as well and paths must be switched accordingly. The priority can be
          configuration or derivation from the PWid. Lower the PWid higher the
          priority. However, this does not guarantee selection of same PW by
          the T-PEs because, for example, mismatch of the configuration of the
          PW priority in each T-PE. The intent of this application is to have
          T-PE1 and T-PE2 synchronize the transmit and receive paths of the PW
          over the network. In other words, both T-PE nodes are required to
          transmit over the PW segment which is switched by the same S-PE.
          This is desirable for ease of operation and troubleshooting.</t>

            </figure>In <xref target="mtu-dual-homing"></xref>, the MTU-s is
          dual homed to PE1-rs and PE2-rs and has spoke PWs to each of them.
          The MTU-s needs to choose only one of the spoke PWs ( the active PW)
          to one of the PE to forward the traffic and the other to standby
          status. The MTU-s can derive the status of the PWs based on local
          policy configuration. PE1-rs and PE2-rs are connected to the H-VPLS
          core on the other side of network. The MTU-s communicates the status
          of its member PWs for a set of Virtual Switching Instances (VSIs)
          having common status of Active or Standby. Here the MTU-s controls
          the selection of PWs to forward the traffic. Signaling using PW
          grouping with a common group-id in PWid FEC Element or Grouping TLV
          in Generalized PWid FEC Element as defined in <xref
          target="RFC4447"></xref> to PE1-rs and PE2rs respectively, is
          recommended to scale better.</t>

          <t>Whenever MTU-s performs a switchover, it needs to communicate to
          PE2-rs for the Standby PW group the change to the status of
          active.</t>

          <t>In this scenario, PE devices are aware of switchovers at MTU-s
          and could generate MAC Withdraw Messages to trigger MAC flushing
          within the H-VPLS full mesh. By default, MTU-s devices should still
          trigger MAC Withdraw messages as currently defined in <xref
          target="RFC4762"></xref> to prevent two copies of MAC withdraws to
          be sent (one by MTU-s and another one by the PE-rs'). Mechanisms to
          disable the MAC Withdraw trigger in certain devices are out of the
          scope of this document.</t>

            </figure>In <xref target="vpls-bridge"></xref>, two provider
          access networks, each having two n-PEs, where the n-PEs are
          connected via a full mesh of PWs for a given VPLS instance. As shown
          in the figure, only one n-PE in each access network is serving as a
          Primary PE (P) for that VPLS instance and the other n-PE is serving
          as the backup PE (B). In this figure, each primary PE has two active
          PWs originating from it. Therefore, when a multicast, broadcast, and
          unknown unicast frame arrives at the primary n-PE from the access
          network side, the n-PE replicates the frame over both PWs in the
          core even though it only needs to send the frames over a single PW
          (shown with :::: in the figure) to the primary n-PE on the other
          side. This is an unnecessary replication of the customer frames that
          consumes core-network bandwidth (half of the frames get discarded at
          the receiving n-PE). This issue gets aggravated when there is three
          or more n-PEs per provider, access network. For example if there are
          three n-PEs or four n-PEs per access network, then 67% or 75% of
          core-BW for multicast, broadcast and unknown unicast are wasted,
          respectively.</t>

          <t>In this scenario, n-PEs can disseminate the status of PWs
          active/standby among them and furthermore to have it tied up with
          the redundancy mechanism such that per VPLS instance the status of
          active/backup n-PE gets reflected on the corresponding PWs emanating
          from that n-PE.</t>

            1:1 protection MUST be supported. The N:1 protection case is less
            efficient in terms of the resources that must be allocated and
            hence this SHOULD be supported. 1+1 protection architecture MAY be
            suported, but its definition is for further study.</t>

            <t>Non-revertive behavior MUST be supported, while revertive
            behavior is OPTIONAL. This avoids the need to designate one PW as
            primary unless revertive behavior is explicitly required.</t>

            <t>Protection switchover can be initiated from a PE e.g. using a
            Manual lockout/force switchover, or it may be triggered by a
            signal failure i.e. a defect in the PW or PSN. Manual switchover
            may be necessary if it is required to disable one PW in a
            redundant set. Both methods MUST be supported and signal failure
            triggers MUST be treated with a higher priority than any local or
            far-end manual trigger.</t>

            <t>Note that a PE MAY be able to forward packets received from a
            standby status PW in order to avoid black holing of in-flight
            packets during switchover. However, in the case of use of VPLS,
            all VPLS application packets received from standby PWs MUST be
