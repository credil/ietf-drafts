Internet-Draft     MT Extensions To MPLS/BGP L3VPN MIB         July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Multi Topology (MT) solution makes it possible to establish
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) across
   a specific, or set of, multiple topologies.  By using these MT LSPs,
   Layer-3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPN) can benefit from the
   advantages of Multi Topology, such as service separation, end-to-end
   protection, simplified inter-AS deployment, etc.

   The motivation of this document is to facilitate the configuration
   and management of such MT based MPLS/BGP L3VPN.  It defines
   extensions to MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB to support MT features.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminologies from the document describing the
   MPLS architecture [RFC3031] and from the document describing MPLS
   Layer-3 VPNs (L3VPN) [RFC4364], as well as the MPLS LDP Multi
   Topology [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology].

   Throughout this document, the use of the terms "Provider Edge (PE)
   and Customer Edge (CE)" or "PE/CE" will be replaced by "PE" in all
   cases except when a network device is a CE when used in the carrier's
   carrier model.


3.  Requirements

   Within a Service Provider's MPLS backbone, besides default topology,
   there might be some more topolgies with MT LSPs on them.  Provider
   Edge (PE) routers should associate the VPN service(s) to a specific
   topology.  Multiple VPN application can share a same topology, or use
   their respective ones.

                      MT Based MPLS/BGP L3VPN Example

                                 Figure 1

   In the figure above, the paths between PE1 and PE2 can be separated
   into several topologies.  In this example, PE1--PE2 belongs to
   default topology, while PE1--P1--PE2 belongs to RED topology, and
   PE1--P2--PE2 belongs to BLUE topology.  And the applications over
   this MT based MPLS backbone can be associated to diferrent VPNs, or
   diferrent services (such as IPv4 and IPv6 services) in a same VPN.
   Users are allowed to map each application to a specific topology by
   configuration, for instance, App1 maps to the LSPs in the RED
   topology, App2 maps to the LSPs in the default topology, App3 maps to
   the LSPs in the BLUE topology.  Then the VPN performance can be
   monitored per topology.


4.  Extensions To MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB

4.1.  Example Of Setting UP MT Based MPLS L3VPN

   [RFC4364] demonstrates MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB to setup MPLS L3VPN.  In
   order to setup MT based MPLS L3VPN, this document adds one object to
   mplsL3VpnVrfTable to specify the topology used in MPLS backbone.

           "The storage type for this VPN VRF entry.
            Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent'
            need not allow write access to any columnar
            objects in the row."

5.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thank authors of [RFC4362] and the authors of
   draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology from which some text of this
   document has been inspired.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has assigned { mplsStdMIB 11 } to the MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB
   module specified in [RFC 4362].  This document only makes extensions
   to the MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB module, there is no further IANA
   requirement.


7.  Security Considerations

   No specific security issues with the proposed solutions are known.
   The proposed extension in this document does not introduce any new
   security considerations beyond that already apply to the base MPLS/
   BGP L3VPN specification as [RFC 3031] and [RFC 4364].
