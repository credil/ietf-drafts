      <t>This document defines support for the operation of IS-IS over
      Unidirectional Links without the use of tunnels or encapsulation of
      IS-IS Protocol Data Units. Adjacency establishment when the return path
      from the router at the receive end of a unidirectional link to the
      router at the transmit end of the unidirectional link is via another
      unidirectional link is supported. The extensions defined here are
      backwards compatible - only the routers directly connected to a
      unidirectional link need to be upgraded.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Operation of IS-IS depends upon two-way connectivity. Adjacencies are
      formed by exchanging hellos on a link, flooding of the link state
      database is made reliable by exchanges between neighbors on a link, etc.
      However, there are deployments where operation of the protocol is
      desired over links which are unidirectional i.e., one end of the link
      can only send Protocol Data Units (PDUs) and one end of the link can
      only receive PDUs. Traditional methods of supporting Unidirectional
      Links (UDLs) have involved establishing a tunnel from the Intermediate
      System (IS) at the receive end of the UDL to the IS at the transmit end
      of the UDL, encapsulating/decapsulating the IS-IS PDUs as they
      enter/exit the tunnel, and associating the PDUs received via the tunnel
      with the UDL at the transmit end. This typically requires static
      configuration and may introduce Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) issues
      due to the required encapsulation.</t>

      <t>This specification defines extensions to the protocol which support
      correct and reliable operation of IS-IS over UDLs without the need for
      tunnels or any form of encapsulation.</t>
    </section>

    <section title=" Encoding Extensions">
      <t>Although the IS at the transmit end of a UDL link (IS-T) can send
      IS-IS PDUs normally on the link, the IS at the receive end of a UDL link
      (IS-R) requires assistance from other ISs in the network to pass the
      information it would normally send directly to IS-T. The Update Process
      as defined in [IS-IS] allows information generated by one IS in the
      network to be reliably flooded to all other ISs in the network using
      Link State PDUs (LSPs). The extensions defined here utilize LSPs to
      allow IS-R to send information normally sent in hellos (IIHs) or
      sequence number PDUs (SNPs) to IS-T in LSPs. As LSPs are flooded to all
      ISs in an area/sub-domain, care is taken to minimize the LSP churn
      necessary to support adjacency establishment and maintenance between
      IS-T and IS-R.</t>

      <section title="UDL LSPs and the UDL-TLV">
        <t>Routers on the receive end of a UDL MUST reserve at least one LSP
        (for each level supported on the UDL) to advertise the UDL information
        described below. Such LSPs are referred to as UDL-LSPs although the
        only distinction between a UDL-LSP and other LSPs is in the TLV
        information which is present in such an LSP. LSP #0 MUST NOT be used
        to send UDL information. UDL-LSPs have the following special
        characteristics:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The only TLV which may be advertised in UDL-LSPs is the UDL TLV
            described below and (optionally) an Authentication TLV and/or
            Purge Originator Identification TLV [RFC6232] . This requirement
            is enforced by the originator of the UDL-LSP but is not checked by
            receiving systems i.e., other TLVs which are included in a UDL-LSP
            are processed normally. The reason for the restriction is to
            minimize the number of LSPs which have UDL information
            content.</t>

            <t>Routers on the transmit side of a UDL flood UDL-LSPs regardless
            of the existence of an adjacency in the UP state on that circuit.
            Flooding of UDL-LSPs on circuits other than a UDL is as specified
            in [IS-IS] i.e., no special handling.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>A new TLV is defined in which UDL specific information appears. All
        information in a UDL-TLV is encoded in sub-TLVs. UDL sub-TLVs are
        formatted as specified in [RFC5305]. The format of the UDL-TLV is
        therefore:</t>

        <t>UDL links may operate in Point-to-Point mode or in broadcast mode
        (assuming the subnetwork is a broadcast subnetwork). There are
        therefore two types of Intermediate System Neighbors sub-TLVs defined.
        A UDL-TLV MUST NOT contain more than one Intermediate System Neighbors
        sub-TLV. If multiple Intermediate System Neighbors sub-TLVs appear in
        a UDL-TLV all information in that UDL-TLV MUST be ignored.</t>

    <section title="Adjacency Establishment">
      <t>An adjacency over a UDL link may be established over a link operating
      in Point-to-Point mode (including a LAN subnetwork configured to operate
      in Point-to-Point mode) or a link operating in broadcast mode. Operation
      in either mode is identical except for some differences in the manner of
      adjacency establishment as specified in the following sub-sections.</t>

      <t>IS-T utilizes the set of manualAreaAddresses advertised by IS-R in a
      UDL Manual Area Address sub-TLV in combination with the UDL Intermediate
      System Neighbor sub-TLV(s) to IS-T advertised by IS-R to determine the
      level(s) associated with any adjacency to IS-R.</t>

      <section title="Adjacency Establishment in Point-to-Point Mode">
        <t>Adjacency establishment makes use of Three Way Handshake as defined
        in [RFC5303] when operating in Point-to-Point mode. When operating
        over a LAN subnetwork, the use of point-to-point operation over LAN as
        defined in [RFC5309] is also used.</t>

        <t>IS-T initiates adjacency establishment by sending Point-to-Point
        IIHs over the UDL as normal i.e., including Three-Way Handshake TLV.
        Note that the local circuit ID specified by IS-T need only be unique
        among the set of Point-to-Point UDL links supported by IS-T on which
        IS-T is at the transmit end.</t>

        <t>Upon receipt of a Point-to-Point IIH IS-R creates an adjacency in
        the INIT state with IS-T and advertises the existence of the adjacency
        in its UDL-LSP(s) utilizing the UDL Point-to-Point Intermediate System
        Neighbor sub-TLV. The Local LAN address is included if the link is a
        LAN subnetwork operating in Point-to-Point mode. UDL-LSPs of the
        appropriate level(s) are generated according to the type of the
        adjacency with IS-T.</t>

        <t>When IS-T receives the UDL-LSP(s) generated by IS-R containing the
        UDL Point-to-Point Intermediate System Neighbor sub-TLV it validates
        the 3 way information and, if valid, transitions its adjacency to UP
        state. In subsequent Point-to-Point IIHs IS-T includes IS-R's circuit
        ID information as indicated in the UDL Point-to-Point IS Neighbor
        sub-TLV in its 3 way handshake TLV. A complete set of CSNPs is sent to
        IS-R for the level(s) appropriate for the type of adjacency. LSPs
        which are updated as a result of the existence of the adjacency to
        IS-R are sent to IS-R, but IS-T does NOT propagate its full LSP
        Database. This is done to minimize the amount of redundant
        flooding.</t>

        <t>IS-R uses normal adjacency bring up rules based on the 3 way
        handshake information it receives in Point-to-Point IIHs from IS-T and
        advertises its IS neighbor to IS-T in the usual manner i.e. in an LSP
        other than a UDL-LSP. Following transition of the adjacency to IS-T to
        the UP state IS-R MAY request IS-T to flood its complete LSP Database
        by sending an LSP Range sub-TLV to IS-T in a UDL-LSP.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Adjacency Establishment in Broadcast Mode">
        <t>IS-T initiates adjacency establishment by sending LAN IIHs of the
        appropriate level(s) over the UDL as normal. IS-T specifies itself in
        the LAN ID field of the IIH, including a non-zero circuit ID. Note
        that the local circuit ID specified by IS-T need only be unique among
        the set of LAN UDL links supported by IS-T on which IS-T is at the
        transmit end. This is because pseudo-node LSPs will never be generated
        for a UDL. Operation in broadcast mode supports a UDL with a single
        IS-T and multiple IS-Rs.</t>

        <t>Upon receipt of a LAN IIH PDU IS-R creates an adjacency in the INIT
        state with IS-T and advertises the existence of the adjacency in its
        UDL-LSP(s) utilizing the UDL LAN Intermediate System Neighbor sub-TLV.
        UDL-LSPs of the appropriate level(s) are generated according to the
        levels supported by IS-R and IS-T.</t>

        <t>When IS-T receives the UDL-LSP(s) generated by IS-R containing the
        UDL LAN Intermediate System Neighbor sub-TLV(s) it validates the LANID
        and, if valid, transitions its adjacency to UP state. In subsequent
        LAN IIH PDUs, IS-T includes IS-R's LAN Address as indicated in the UDL
        LAN IS Neighbor info. A complete set of CSNPs for the appropriate
        level is sent over the circuit. LSPs which are updated as a result of
        the existence of the adjacency to IS-R are sent to IS-R, but IS-T does
        NOT propagate its full LSP Database. This is done to minimize the
        amount of redundant flooding.</t>

        <t>IS-R uses normal adjacency bring up rules based on the IS Neighbor
        LAN Address information it receives in LAN IIH PDUs from IS-T and
        advertises its IS neighbor to IS-T in an LSP other than a UDL-LSP.
        Note that there is no pseudo-node on a UDL LAN circuit &ndash;
        therefore both IS-T and IS-R MUST advertise an IS Neighbor TLV to each
        other, not to a pseudo-node. This is identical to what is done on a
        Point-to-Point subnetwork. Following transition of the adjacency to
        IS-T to the UP state IS-R MAY request IS-T to flood its complete LSP
        Database by sending an LSP Range sub-TLV to IS-T in a UDL-LSP.</t>

      <section title="UDL link metric configuration">
        <t>What metrics are configured on a UDL depend upon the intended use
        of the UDL. If the UDL is to be used for unicast forwarding, then IS-T
        should be configured with the value appropriate to its intended
        preference in the network topology and IS-R should be configured with
        maximum link metric (2^24 -1) as defined in [RFC5305] (assuming wide
        metrics are in use). If the UDL is to be used for building a multicast
        Reverse Path Forwarding tree, then IS-R should be configured with the
        value appropriate to its intended preference in the network topology
        and IS-T should be configured with maximum link metric (2^24 -1).If
        the link is to be used for both unicast forwarding and multicast, then
        it is necessary to have two different metric configurations and
        perform two different SPF calculations. This may be achieved through
        the use of multi-topology extensions as defined in [RFC5120]. Note
        that the configured link metrics have no bearing on adjacency
        establishment &ndash; they only affect the building of a Shortest Path
        Tree (SPT).</t>

    <section title="Adjacency Maintenance">
      <t>This section defines how adjacencies are maintained once established.
      Adjacency maintenance is defined without the need to send periodic
      UDL-LSP updates as this would be a significant burden on the entire
      network.</t>

      <section title="Adjacency Maintenance by IS-T">
        <t>IS-T sends IIH PDUs as normal on a UDL. As IS-R does NOT send IIH
        PDUs to IS-T, IS-T maintains the adjacency to IS-R so long as all of
        the following conditions are TRUE:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>IS-T has a valid UDL-LSP from IS-R which includes
            Point-to-Point UDL IS Neighbor information or LAN UDL IS Neighbor
            information (as appropriate) regarding the adjacency IS-R has with
            IS-T on the UDL.</t>

            <t>IS-T can calculate a return path rooted at IS-R to IS-T which
            does not traverse the UDL on which the adjacency is associated</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>When either of the above conditions becomes FALSE, IS-T brings down
        its adjacency to IS-R. Note that the return path calculation is only
        required when a topology change occurs in the network. It therefore
        need only be done in conjunction with a normal event driven SPF
        calculation.</t>

        <t>NOTE: Immediately after the adjacency to IS-R has come up, if the
        only available return path traverses a UDL link on which the adjacency
        is still in the process of coming UP, the return path check will fail.
        This is possible because we bypass normal flooding rules to allow the
        UDL-LSP to be flooded even when the adjacency is not UP on a UDL link
        (as described later in this document). If IS-T immediately brings the
        adjacency to IS-R down in this case, a circular dependency condition
        arises. To avoid this, if the return path check fails immediately
        after the adjacency comes up, a timer Tp is started. The timer is
        cancelled when a return path check succeeds. If the timer expires,
        IS-T brings down the adjacency to IS-R. A recommended value for the
        timer Tp is a small multiple (e.g., "twice") of the estimated time
        necessary to propagate LSPs across the entire domain.</t>

        <t>Although it is unorthodox to bring up an adjacency without
        confirmed two way connectivity, the extension is well grounded because
        the receipt of IS-R&rsquo;s UDL-LSP by IS-T is indicative of the
        existence of a return path even though it cannot yet be confirmed by
        examination of the LSP database. This unconfirmed two way connectivity
        is a condition which we do not want to persist indefinitely - hence
        the use of timer Tp.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Adjacency Maintenance by IS-R">
        <t>IS-R maintains its adjacency with IS-T based on receipt of IIHs
        from IS-T as normal. So long as IS-T follows the rules for adjacency
        maintenance described in the previous section this is sufficient.</t>

        <t>Further protection against pathological behavior on the part of
        IS-T (e.g., failure to perform the return path calculation after a
        topology change) MAY be implemented by IS-R. When IS-R receives a CSNP
        from IS-T which contains an SNP entry identifying an LSP which is not
        in IS-R's Link State Database (LSDB) a timer Tf is started for each
        such LSP. This includes entries which are older than, newer than, or
        non-existent in IS-R's LSDB.The timer Tf is cancelled if:<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>The associated LSP is received by IS-R on any circuit by normal
            operation of the Update process or</t>

            <t>A subsequent set of CSNPs received from IS-T does not include
            the LSP entry</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If any timer Tf expires IS-R brings down the adjacency with
        IS-T.</t>

        <t>In the absence of pathological behavior by IS-T the Tf extension is
        not required. Its use is therefore optional.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Use of BFD">
        <t>A multi-hop BFD session [RFC5883] MAY be established between IS-T
        and IS-R. This can be used to provide fast failure detection. If used,
        this would also make the calculation by IS-T of a return path from
        IS-R to IS-T optional.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Operation of the Update Process on a UDL">
      <t>For purposes of LSP propagation IS-T views the UDL as if it were a
      broadcast subnetwork where IS-T is the Designated Intermediate System
      (DIS). This is true regardless of the mode of operation of the circuit
      (point-to-point or broadcast). Therefore, IS-T propagates new LSPs on
      the UDL as they arrive but after sending an LSP on the UDL the SRM flag
      for that LSP is cleared i.e. no acknowledgement for the LSP is required
      or expected. IS-T also sends periodic CSNPs on the UDL.</t>

      <t>IS-R cannot propagate LSPs to IS-T on the UDL. IS-R also cannot
      acknowledge LSPs received from IS-T on the UDL. In this respect IS-R
      operates on the UDL in a manner identical to a non-DIS on a broadcast
      circuit. If an LSP entry in a CSNP received from IS-T identifies an LSP
      which is "newer than" an LSP in IS-R's LSDB, IS-R MAY request the LSP
      from IS-T by sending a UDL-LSP with an LSP entry as described above.
      Since IS-R's UDL-LSP(s) will be propagated throughout the network even
      though the information is only of use to IS-Ts, it is recommended that
      some small delay occur between the receipt of a CSNP from IS-T and the
      generation of a UDL-LSP with an updated LSP entry by IS-R so as to allow
      for the possible receipt of the LSP either from IS-T or on another
      link.</t>

      <t>If the number of LSP entries to be requested exceeds the space
      available in the UDL TLV associated with the adjacency to IS-T, IS-R
      MUST NOT generate multiple UDL TLVs associated with the same adjacency.
      Instead it should maintain the state of SSN flags appropriately for the
      LSP entries that require updates and send additional LSP entries (if
      necessary) in a subsequent UDL-LSP after the previously requested
      updates arrive.</t>

      <t>Use of the LSP Range sub-TLV by IS-R allows more efficient encoding
      of a request for multiple LSPs. This could be especially useful
      following an adjacency UP event on a UDL. As described in Section 3,
      IS-T does NOT propagate its full LSP database following transition of an
      adjacency to IS-R to the UP state. This is consistent with IS-T
      operating in the role of DIS on a broadcast circuit. If IS-R has
      neighbors on other circuits it is possible that it will have received
      LSPs from other neighbors. In such a case flooding of the full LSP
      database by IS-T would be redundant. It is therefore left to the
      discretion of IS-R to request those portions of the LSP database which
      are not current. This is consistent with IS-R operating as a non-DIS on
      a broadcast circuit.</t>

      <t>On receipt of a UDL-LSP generated by IS-R, IS-T checks the neighbor
      information in each UDL-TLV. If the information matches an existing
      adjacency that IS-T has with IS-R then IS-T sets SRM flag on the UDL for
      any LSPs in its LSDB which are "newer" than the corresponding entries
      IS-R sent in LSP Entry sub-TLVs in UDL TLVs. SRM flags are also set on
      the UDL for LSPs which fall in the ranges specified in LSP Range
      sub-TLVs in UDL TLVs. UDL-TLVs associated with adjacencies to routers
      other than IS-T are ignored by IS-T.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Support for UDL on the Return Path">
      <t>If all return paths from IS-R to IS-T traverse a UDL, then in order
      to bring up the adjacency between IS-T and IS-R at least one of the
      adjacencies on a return path UDL must already be UP. This is required
      because IS-T relies on receiving the UDL-LSP(s) generated by IS-R in
      order to bring up its adjacency. In order to overcome a circular
      dependency in the case where multiple pairs of UDL neighbors are trying
      to bring up an adjacency at the same time, an extension to LSP
      propagation rules is required.</t>

      <t>When a new UDL-LSP is received by any IS which has one or more active
      UDLs on which it is operating as an IS-T, the set of neighbors other
      than the local system which are advertised in UDL-TLVs in the received
      UDL-LSP is extracted - call this UDL-LSP-ISN-SET. A return path from the
      originating IS-R to each neighbor in the UDL-LSP-ISN-SET is calculated.
      If there is no return path to one or more neighbors in this set periodic
      propagation of that UDL-LSP on all UDLs on which the local system acts
      as IS-T is initiated regardless of the state of an adjacency on that
      UDL. Periodic transmission of that UDL-LSP continues until a return path
      to all neighbors in the UDL-LSP-ISN-SET exists. This calculation is
      redone whenever the UDL-LSP is updated and when a topology change in the
      network occurs as a result of updates to the LSDB. Note that periodic
      retransmission is only done on UDLs on which the local system acts as
      IS-T.</t>

      <t>If the network is partitioned the lack of a return path from a given
      IS-R to a given IS-T may persist. It is therefore recommended that the
      periodic retransmission employ an exponential backoff timer such that
      when the partition persists the periodic retransmission period is long
      enough so as to not represent a significant burden. It is recommended
      that the periodic retransmission be initially set to the locally
      configured CSNP interval. Note that periodic retransmission is only
      performed on UDL links and if an IS-R has previously received the same
      UDL-LSP it will silently ignore the retransmission since the UDL-LSP
      will already be in its LSDB. Unnecessary reflooding of the retransmitted
      UDL-LSP beyond the UDL does not occur.</t>

      <t>IS-R MUST accept and propagate UDL-LSPs received on a UDL even when
      there is no adjacency in the UP state on the UDL circuit. Flooding of
      UDL-LSPs by IS-R uses normal flooding rules. LSPs received by IS-R on
      the UDL which do NOT include UDL TLVs are discarded unless the adjacency
      is UP (normal processing).</t>

      <t>This extension allows establishment of an adjacency on a UDL even
      when the return path transits another UDL which is also in the process
      of bringing up an adjacency. The periodic nature of the flooding is
      meant to compensate for the unreliability of the flooding. After the
      adjacency is UP, IS-R can request LSPs from IS-T by putting LSP entries
      into UDL-LSPs &ndash; but that ability is not available until the
      adjacency is UP.</t>
