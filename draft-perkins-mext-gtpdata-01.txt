Abstract

   Widely deployed mobility management systems for wireless
   communications use GTP for transmitting packets to mobility agents
   serving the mobile node.  In order to enable use of Proxy Mobile IPv6
   in such telecommunication systems, GTP should be allowed as a
   tunneling choice for packets between the LMA and the MAG.  This
   specification allocates a new bit (the 'G' bit) in the Proxy Binding
   Update for the purpose of enabling GTP tunneling.

1.  Introduction

   Widely deployed mobility management systems for wireless
   communications use GTP [3] for transmitting packets to mobility
   agents serving the mobile node.  In order to enable use of Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 in such telecommunication systems, GTP [2] should be
   allowed as a tunneling choice for packets between the LMA and the
   MAG.  This specification allocates a new bit (the 'G' bit) in the
   Proxy Binding Update for the purpose of enabling GTP tunneling.  This
   specification does not introduce any modifications to GTP.
   Considerations about the use of GTP-C for establishing binding
   updates is outside the scope of this specification.

2.  GTP tunneling bit in Binding Update

   In order to request GTP tunneling, the 'G' bit is set in the Binding
   Update.  This is also useful when the 'P' bit is set, so that the MAG
   can indicate that the LMA should use GTP as the tunneling protocol
   for proxy packet delivery.

3.  New Status Code for GTP tunneling rejection


   The Status is an 8-bit unsigned integer field in a Binding
   Acknowledgement message, indicating the disposition of the Binding
   Update.  Values of the Status field less than 128 indicate that the
   Binding Update was accepted by the receiving node.  Values greater
   than or equal to 128 indicate that the Binding Update was rejected by
   the receiving node.  The following new Status value is specified for
   use when the receiving node cannot provide GTP as a tunneling option.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms, and does
   not have any impact on existing security mechanisms.  Tunneling of
   data via GTP does not introduce any known security vulnerabilities.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document allocates a new bit from the reserved field of the
   Binding Update message header.  The new bit is denoted the 'G' bit.
   This document also creates a new "Status Code" for the Status field
   in the Binding Acknowledgement message.  The new status code,
   "Invalid Tunnel Format", indicates rejection of the requested
   tunneling mode in the Binding Update, and is needed if the receiver
   of the Binding Update does not offer GTP encapsulation.  The new
   Status Code is required to be allocated from the values larger than
   128 in order to indicate that the Binding Update was rejected.
