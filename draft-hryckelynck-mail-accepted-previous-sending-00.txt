Abstract

   Mail Accepted by Previous Sending defines a mechanism by which
   incoming unsollicited mails may be rejected or penalized by a MTA if
   their sender address domains has never been a destination for the
   outgoing mails treated by this MTA.

Internet-Draft      Mail Accepted by Previous Sending          June 2012


1.  Introduction

   It is easy to say that mails with, for example, an attempted fraud
   content are mails we must intercept.

   But for many other type of mail as, for example, marketing mail, it
   is very difficult to make the difference between a mail user wants to
   receive and a mail he does not want to receive.

   In fact, in a lot of cases, the only difference between sollicited
   and unsollicited mail is the recipient advice.

   With this in mind, it MAY be useful to find a mechanism for users to
   choose themselves who will be able to send them some mails.

   This mechanism SHOULD of course be implemented in a way the users do
   not feel too constrained.

   The mechanism described below is an attempt to give an answer to this
   problematic.

   Mail Accepted by Previous Sending defines a mechanism by which
   incoming unsollicited mails may be rejected or penalized by a MTA if
   their sender address domains has never been a destination for the
   outgoing mails treated by this MTA.

2.  Terminology

   The term "domain" use in this document has to be understand as the
   domain part of a SMTP address (user@domain) and must be a FQDN as
   describe in the section 2.3.5 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].  These words take their normative meanings only when they
   are presented in ALL UPPERCASE.

3.  SMTP responsability notion

3.1.  Original SMTP responsability notion

   In the SMTP RFC [RFC5321], you will find a responsability notion.

3.1.1.  responsibility of the client

   As Describe in the section 2.1 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] :

   "The responsability of an SMTP client is to transfer mail messages to
   one or more SMTP servers, or report its failure to do so".

3.1.2.  responsibility of the server

   As Describe in the section 2.1 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] :

   "The protocol requires that a server MUST accept responsability for
   either delivering the message or properly reporting the failure to do
   so"

   As Describe in the section 6.1 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] :

   When the receiver-SMTP accepts a piece of mail (by sending a "250 OK"
   message in response to DATA), it is accepting responsibility for
   delivering or relaying the message.  It must take this responsibility
   seriously.

3.2.  gap is growing with the original notion

3.2.1.  silent dropping

   Because of the huge quantity of unsollicited mail and to avoid giving
   more information to those who are sending them, section 6.2 of RFC
   5321 [RFC5321] permits in practice silent dropping and more and more
   MTAs are configured to drop silently those mails.

3.3.  How to get back to the original notion

3.3.1.  Does the return-path exists ?

   If section 6.2 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] permits in practice silent
   dropping, it also pleads to keep the "delivered or returned" way to
   deal with mails.

   In this sense, those past years, efforts has been made to find some
   ways to check the return path as to stay close from the original SMTP
   responsability notion (deliver or notify).  You of course need a

Internet-Draft      Mail Accepted by Previous Sending          June 2012


   return path in case of notify.

   But at this time the RFC 5321 [RFC5321]in section 3.6.2 doesn't
   recommend any method.

   A return-path is made of two independant elements, the user and the
   domain.  What can be done if we want to check those two elements.

3.3.1.1.  verification of the user part

   User part makes sense only for the MTA which finally delivers the
   mail.

   In the SMTP RFC [RFC5321] the VRFY command permits to ask a MTA about
   the user part.  But to avoid giving more information to those who are
   sending unsollicited mail, the VRFY command has been disabled on most
   MTAs.  The user part of the sender address is therefore uncheckable.

3.3.1.2.  verification of the domain part

   There are four verification levels when checking domain :

   1.  Does the domain exist : First level is to verify if the domain is
       declared in the Internet DNS.  This can be done by a DNS SOA
       Request

   2.  Does the domain has an MX record : Second level is to verify if
       the domain has declared that it can handle mail receiving.  This
       can be done by a DNS MX request.

   3.  Does the domain has a declared MTA : Third level is to verify if
       the answer of the MX request, formerly the name of the server
       which will handle the mails, is properly declared on the Internet
       DNS.  This can be done by a DNS A request.

   4.  Does the MTA is answering : Fourth level is to verify if the
       answer of the A request, formerly the IP address of the MTA, is
       accepting an SMTP connection.  This can be done by a connection
       on the TCP port 25.

   Doing all of these verifications :

   o  Will consume a lot of ressources.  In fact as much work as to send
      a notification (except of the data).

   o  will only prove that your correspondants have a fully compliant
      configuration.

   o  Will not be disuasive for people who wants to send you some
      unsollicited mails as the cost to rent an MTA on Internet and to
      get a fully compliant Internet DNS configuration is very cheap and
      can be change regularly.

   Still the only thing that can definitively makes the difference
   between a sollicited and an unsollicited mail is the recipient
   advice.

3.3.2.  Does the return-path has been sollicited ?

3.3.2.1.  situation resume

   Briefly :

   o  We MUST NOT drop messages without sending notifications.

   o  So there SHOULD be a return path for notifications.

   o  And it MAY be rational to verify this return path validity.

   o  But today we can only check the domain part of the sender address.

   o  And it is a very heavy process.

3.3.2.2.  Mail accepted by previous sending

   To verify the domain and in the same time to be sure the user wants
   to comunicate with this domain we could apply the following
   mechanism.

   When mails are going out :

   o  Take the domain part of the recipient address.

   o  Store it, if not already store, in a base as accepted or rejected
      domains.

   Then when a mail is coming in :

   o  Take the domain part of the sender address.

   o  Check in the base if users accepted or rejected this domain

   o  If some user accepted the domain, we MAY accept the mail.

   o  If some user rejected the domain, we MAY reject and notify, or
      penalize the mail.

   This mechanism is fully compliant with RFC 5321 [RFC5321].

   As Describe in the section 2.1 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] : "The protocol
   requires that a server MUST accept responsability for either
   delivering the message or properly reporting the failure to do so"

   And in section 7.9 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321] : "It is a well-established
   principle that an SMTP server may refuse to accept mail for any
   operational or technical reason that makes sense to the site
   providing the server."

   And it has the advantage to give the user the possibility to
   explicitly declare what is for him a sollicited mail.

6.3.  reject a domain On demand

   To declare a mail as Unsollicited, user sends an outgoing mail with a
   specific header, a filter intercepts the mail and adds the domain
   part of the recipient adress as rejected in the base.

9.  Recommendations

9.1.  Transparent mode

   When a company wants to implement this mechanism.  It SHOULD, at the
   beginning, activate only the "Automatically" mode (see 4.1) without
   applying any policy.

   During a period of time, the base will be automatically filled with
   accepted domain.

   At the beginning the size of the base will grow up very fast.

   After a while, when the growing of the base will slow down, the MTA
   administrator could then :

   o  Communicate to users the way to accept or reject domain.

   o  Start to reject or penalize non previoulsy accepted domain.

9.2.  base to be shared

   Information in the Base SHOULD be sharable by all MTA in a same
   company.

9.3.  Size of the base

   To limit the size of the base, the Date field can be used to delete
   oldest records.

9.4.  Notification

   If you make the choice, considering the information in the base, to
   reject the mail, you MUST return a 5.5.0 code as Describe in the
   section 3.6.2 of RFC 5321 [RFC5321].

11.  Security Considerations

11.1.  IP reputation

   Ip reputation mechanism will still protect you against massive
   sending.  Without this mechanism the domain verification process
   could be a target for Deny of service attack.

11.2.  SPF, Sender ID and DKIM

   It is not garanteed, when a mail which has a sender address from a
   domain you previously accepted, that this mail really come from this
   domain.  For this purpose you may need other mechanism that could be
   viewed as complementary like Sender ID [RFC4406], SPF [RFC4408] or
   DKIM [RFC6376].

11.3.  Mail analysis

   Mail analysis is still needed, as a previously accepted domain MAY
   have been temporarly corrupted and MAY send you temporarly
   unsollicited mail.

11.4.  Authentification

   The possibility you give to user to authorize a domain just by
   sending a mail SHOULD be limited to authentified user.
