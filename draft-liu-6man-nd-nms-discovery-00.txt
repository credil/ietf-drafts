Internet-Draft     IPv6 ND Option for NMS Discovery       October 2013




1. Introduction

   NMS (Network Management System) has become a must-have component in
   modern networks. It could be utilized to benefit various aspects of a
   network. For example, the emerging router auto-configuration
   solutions are mostly based on NMS. If the devices could successfully
   connect to the NMS server(s), then auto-configuration won't be a
   problem.

   So there is a key problem of how to discover the NMS server for the
   devices when they get online. Currently there are mainly two methods
   to solve the problem. One is to set the NMS server's IP/URL into the
   devices before shipping to the customer premises; the other one is
   the NMS actively discovering the devices through some polling
   mechanisms. The former one is easy to be implemented and deployed,
   but it lacks flexibility due to the static pre-configuration and
   might be error-prone for configuration when the different networks
   have different NMS servers; the latter one lacks the instantaneity
   due to the polling mechanisms need the intermediate nodes to
   integrate supporting features which introduce complex functions and
   protocols.

   This document introduces a mechanism for devices to actively learn
   the NMS server from the neighbors through IPv6 ND protocol extension.
   It is a good leverage of IPv6 automatic features.

   This document only discusses problem/solution within the IPv6-only
   scope.

2. Basic Approach

   When a device gets online, we could assume that its neighbors who
   have already got online have learnt the NMS server's address. So it
   is quite easy for the new device to learn the information from its
   neighbor.

   This document is based on the above Neighbor-Learning approach.

3. Scenario Description

3.1. New Devices Getting Online

   - Adding a New Device into an Existing Network

Internet-Draft     IPv6 ND Option for NMS Discovery       October 2013


   For adding a new device into an existing network, it is very
   reasonable to assume that the neighbors have already connected to the
   NMS server. So it is obvious that the new device could easily learn
   the NMS server's address from neighbors.

   - Deploying a New Network

   In the case of deploying a new network, the NMS server address needs
   to be propagated to the whole network, then some kind of flooding
   mechanism is needed if the propagation also relies on above mentioned
   neighbor-learning approach. This is applicable through careful plan
   which might need proper order for the devices to get online
   successively.

   The detail of the flooding mechanism is out of the scope of this
   document. We treat it as an assumption for the application of
   neighbor-learning NMS discovery.

3.2. Regarding Connectivity

   - Connecting NMS after Getting Global Connectivity

   Normally, address assignment is not coupled with NMS processings.
   Before connected to the NMS server, the devices could obtain global
   connectivity either through SLAAC or DHCPv6.

   In this case, once the devices have learnt the NMS server address,
   they could directly connect to get more configurations.

   - Connecting NMS before Getting Global Connectivity

   In contrast, address assignment might be done through NMS in some
   situations. For example, the device is a backbone router, and the
   address has been carefully planned and pre-configured in the NMS
   server, when the device connect to the server, it will be assigned
   global address through network management processing.

   In this case, after learning the NMS server address, the device might
   need a proxy to communicate with the server or configuring itself a
   ULA address and utilizing the NPTv6 processing on its neighbor or
   uplink router. The details are out of the scope of this document.

4. Neighbor Discovery Extension for Supporting NMS Discovery

   Since ND is a basic protocol in IPv6, every router supports IPv6
   would support ND, we utilize ND extension to achieve the above
   mentioned neighbor-learning NMS server discovery.

4.3. Option Carried in Router Advertisement Messages

   - RA-only Mode

   A device discoveries NMS server's address through received Router
   Advertisement messages which include a new option defined for
   carrying NMS server's address.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 ND Option for NMS Discovery       October 2013


   Since RA messages are usually generated by the gateway on a link,
   this approach is suitable for a hub-and-spoke subnet in which a new
   device joins in.

   After having learnt the NMS server's address, then the device could
   directly connect to the server

4.4. Option Carried in Neighbor Solicit/Advertisement Messages

   A device discoveries NMS server's address through actively initiating
   Neighbor Solicit message and receiving Neighbor Advertisement
   messages which include the new option carrying the NMS server's
   address.

   This approach is suitable for point-to-point or non-broad circuits.

5. Security Considerations

   - Device authentication for NMS Servers

   With applying the mechanism described in this document, the devices
   would actively connect to the NMS servers. So there might be stronger
   desire for the NMS servers to authenticate the devices.

   - ND security

   This document doesn't introduce more threats than original Neighbor
   Discovery protocol, so generally it aligns with the security
   considerations described in [RFC4861].

6. IANA Considerations

   The newly defined options need IANA to assign type codes.
