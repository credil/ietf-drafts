Internet-Draft        CLEFIA Cipher Suites for TLS              May 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies cipher suites for the Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC5246] protocol to support the CLEFIA [RFC6114]
   encryption algorithm as a block cipher algorithm.  The proposed
   ciphersuites include variants using the SHA-2 family of cryptographic
   hash functions [FIPS180-3] and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM].
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) cipher suites and Pre-Shared Key
   (PSK) [RFC4279] cipher suites are also included.

1.1.  CLEFIA

   CLEFIA is a 128-bit blockcipher algorithm, with key lengths of 128,
   192, and 256 bits, which is compatible with the interface of the
   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [FIPS-197].  The algorithm of
   CLEFIA was published in 2007 [FSE07].  Since AES was designed,
   cryptographic technologies have been advancing: new techniques on
   attack, design and implementation are extensively studied.  CLEFIA is
   designed based on the state-of-the-art techniques on design and
   analysis of block ciphers.  The security of CLEFIA has been
   scrutinized in the public community, and no security weaknesses have
   been reported so far.

   CLEFIA is a general purpose blockcipher, and offers high performance
   in software and hardware.  Especially, CLEFIA has an advantage in
   efficient hardware implementation over AES, Camellia, and SEED, which
   can be used in TLS.  Its gate efficiency, which is defined as the
   ratio of speed to gate size, is superior to these ciphers [ISCAS08].

   CLEFIA is standardized in ISO/IEC 29192-2 [ISO29192-2].  ISO/IEC
   29192 is a standardization project of "LightWeight Cryptography
   (LWC)", which is a cryptographic algorithm or protocol tailored for
   implementation in constrained environments including RFID tags,
   sensors, contactless smart cards and so on.  LWC contributes to the
   security of the constrained devices connecting with IP.  CLEFIA is
   also proposed in the CRYPTREC project for the revision of the
   e-Government recommended ciphers list in Japan [CRYPTREC].

   The algorithm specification is described in RFC6114 [RFC6114].
   Further information about CLEFIA, which includes design rationale,
   security evaluations, implementation results, and a reference code,
   is available from [CLEFIAWEB].

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

2.3.  GCM based Cipher Suites

   The twenty cipher suites use the same asymmetric key algorithms as
   those in the previous section but use the authenticated encryption
   modes defined in TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] with CLEFIA in GCM [GCM].

3.  Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1.  Key Exchange

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, ECDH, DH_anon, and ECDHE
   key exchanges are performed as defined in RFC5246 [RFC5246].

3.2.  Cipher

   The CLEFIA_128_CBC cipher suites use CLEFIA [RFC6114] in CBC mode
   with a 128-bit key and 128-bit Initialization Vector (IV); the
   CLEFIA_256_CBC cipher suites use a 256-bit key and 128-bit IV.

   AES-authenticated encryption with associated data algorithms,
   AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM are described in RFC5116
   [RFC5116].  AES GCM cipher suites for TLS are described in RFC5288
   [RFC5288].  AES and CLEFIA share common characteristics, including
   key sizes and block length.  CLEFIA_128_GCM and CLEFIA_256_GCM are
   defined according to those characteristics of AES.

3.3.  Hash and PRFs

3.3.1.  Hash and PRFs prior to TLS 1.2

   The cipher suites ending with _SHA use HMAC-SHA1 as the MAC
   algorithm.

   When used with TLS versions prior to TLS 1.2 ( TLS 1.0 [RFC2246] and
   TLS 1.1 [RFC4346]), the PRF is calculated as specified in the
   appropriate version of the TLS specification.

3.3.2.  Hash and PRFs for TLS 1.2

   The hash algorithms and pseudorandom function (PRF) algorithms for
   TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] SHALL be as follows:

   a) The cipher suites ending with _SHA256 use HMAC-SHA-256 [RFC2104]
   as the MAC algorithm, The PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA-256
   [FIPS180-3] as the hash function,
   b) The cipher suites ending with _SHA384 use HMAC-SHA-384 [RFC2104]
   as the MAC algorithm, The PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA-384
   [FIPS180-3] as the hash function.

3.4.  PSK cipher suites

   PSK cipher suites for TLS are described in RFC4279 [RFC4279], RFC4785
   [RFC4785], RFC5487 [RFC5487], and RFC5489 [RFC5489].

4.  Security Considerations

   The security of CLEFIA algorithm has been scrutinized in the public
   community since the algorithm was proposed, but no security
   weaknesses have been reported so far.

   The cipher suites with SHA-1 are included in this document for
   interoperability with TLS prior to 1.2.  NIST SP 800-131A describes
   that SHA-1 for non-digital signature applications (including HMAC-
   SHA-1) is acceptable; no security risk is currently known.  The use
   of SHA-1 for digital signature generation by US Federal government
   agencies is allowed through 2013, but the user must accept some risk
   [SP800-131A].  SHA-1 may be used for digital signature verification
   in legacy-use, but there may be risk in doing so.  Methods for
   mitigating this risk should be considered [SP800-131A].

   For other security considerations, please refer to the security
   considerations in previous RFCs ([RFC4279], [RFC4785], [RFC5116],
   [RFC5288], [RFC5289], [RFC5487], and [GCM]).  These apply to this
   document as well.
