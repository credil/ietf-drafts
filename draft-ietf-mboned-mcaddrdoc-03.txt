Internet-Draft    Multicast Addresses for Documentation    February 2012


1.  Introduction

   It is often useful in documentation, IETF documents, etc., to provide
   examples containing IP multicast addresses.  For documentation where
   examples of general purpose multicast addresses are needed, one
   should use multicast addresses that never will be assigned or in
   actual use.  There is a risk that addresses used in examples may
   accidentally be used.  It is then important that the same addresses
   are not used by other multicast applications or services.  It may
   also be beneficial to filter out such addresses from multicast
   signalling and multicast data sent to such addresses.

   For unicast there are both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses reserved for this
   purpose, see [RFC5737] and [RFC3849] respectively.  This document
   reserves multicast addresses for this purpose.

   There are also some multicast addresses that are derived from AS
   numbers or unicast addresses.  For examples where such addresses are
   desired, one should derive them from the AS numbers and unicast
   addresses reserved for documentation purposes.  This document also
   discusses the use of these.

2.  IPv4 multicast documentation addresses

   For Any-Source Multicast (ASM), the IPv4 multicast addresses
   allocated for documentation purposes are 233.252.0.0 - 233.252.0.255
   (233.252.0.0/24).

   For Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) it is less important which
   multicast addresses are used, since a host/application joins a
   channel identified by both source and group.  Any source addresses
   used in SSM examples should be unicast addresses reserved for
   documentation purposes.  There are three unicast address ranges
   provided for documentation use in [RFC5737].  The ranges are
   192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24.

   Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific type of address
   is desired.  E.g. for text about multicast scoping, one might want
   the examples to use addresses that are to be used for administrative
   scoping.  See below for guidance on how to construct specific types
   of example addresses.

2.1.  Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses

   Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses [RFC2365] are
   reserved for scoped multicast.  They can be used within a site or an
   organization.  Apart from a small set of scope relative addresses,
   these addresses are not assigned.  The high order /24 in every scope
   is reserved for relative assignments.  A relative assignment is an
   integer offset from the highest address in the scope and represents
   an IPv4 address.  For documentation purposes, the integer offset is
   TBD1.  This provides one multicast address per scope.

   For example in the Local Scope 239.255.0.0/16, the multicast address
   for documentation purposes is 239.255.255.255-TBD1.

2.2.  GLOP multicast addresses

   GLOP [RFC3180] is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast group
   addresses from 16 bit AS numbers.  For examples where GLOP addresses
   are desired, the addresses should be derived from the AS numbers
   reserved for documentation use.

   The 16 bit AS numbers reserved for documentation use in [RFC5398] are
   64496 - 64511.  By use of [RFC3180], we then get 16 /24 multicast
   prefixes for documentation use.  The first one 233.251.240.0/24, and
   the last 233.251.255.0/24.

2.3.  Unicast prefix based IPv4 multicast addresses

   IPv4 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv4 unicast prefixes,
   see [RFC6034].  For examples where this type of addresses are
   desired, the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses
   reserved for documentation purposes, see [RFC5737].

   There are three unicast address ranges provided for documentation use
   in [RFC5737].  The ranges are 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24 and
   203.0.113.0/24.  Using [RFC6034] this leaves us with the unicast
   prefix based IPv4 multicast addresses 234.192.0.2, 234.198.51.100 and
   234.203.0.113.

3.  IPv6 multicast documentation addresses

   For Any-Source Multicast (ASM) the IPv6 multicast addresses allocated
   for documentation purposes are TBD2.

   For Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) it is less important which
   multicast addresses are used, since a host/application joins a
   channel identified by both source and group.  Any source addresses
   used in SSM examples should be unicast addresses reserved for
   documentation purposes.  The IPv6 unicast prefix reserved for
   documentation purposes is 2001:DB8::/32, see [RFC3849].

   Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific type of address
   is desired.  E.g. for text about multicast scoping, one might want
   the examples to use addresses that are to be used for administrative
   scoping.  See below for guidance on how to construct specific types
   of example addresses.

3.1.  Unicast prefix based IPv6 multicast addresses

   IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes,
   see [RFC3306].  For examples where this type of addresses is desired,
   the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses reserved
   for documentation purposes.

   The IPv6 unicast prefix reserved for documentation purposes is 2001:
   DB8::/32, see [RFC3849].  This allows a wide range of different IPv6
   multicast addresses.  Using just the base /32 prefix, one gets the
   IPv6 multicast prefixes FF3X:20:2001:DB8::/64, one for each available
   scope X. One can also produce longer prefixes from this.  Just as an
   example, one can pick say a /64 prefix 2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/64 which
   gives the multicast prefixes FF3X:40:2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/96, one for
   each available scope X.

3.2.  Embedded-RP IPv6 multicast addresses

   There is a type of IPv6 multicast addresses called Embedded-RP
   addresses where the IPv6 address of a Rendezvous-Point is embedded
   inside the multicast address, see [RFC3956].  For examples where this
   type of addresses is desired, the addresses should be derived from
   the unicast addresses reserved for documentation purposes, see
   [RFC3849].

   For documentation purposes, the RP address can be any address from
   the range 2001:DB8::/32 that follows the constraints specified in
   [RFC3956].  One example address could be 2001:DB8::1.  The
   embedded-RP multicast prefixes might then be FF7X:120:2001:DB8::/96.
   Another example could be the RP address 2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::7 which

   gives the prefixes FF7X:740:2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::/96.  See also the
   examples in [RFC3956].

4.  Security Considerations

   The use of specific multicast addresses for documentation purposes
   has no impact on security.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a scope relative IPv4 address for
   documentation purposes.  The string TBD1 in this document should be
   replaced by the assigned offset.  Also the string 255-TBD1 should be
   replaced by the value of 255 minus the assigned offset.  These last
   two sentences should be deleted before publishing.

   IANA is requested to assign "variable scope" IPv6 multicast addresses
   for documentation purposes.  This should be a /96 prefix of the form
   FF0X:...  The word TBD2 in this text should be replaced with the
   assigned prefix, and this sentence should be deleted before
   publishing.
