        Coloring based IP Flow Performance Measurement Framework
              draft-chen-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework-00

Abstract

   By setting one unused bit of the IP header of packets to "color" the
   packets into different color blocks, it naturally gives a way to
   measure the real packet loss and delay without inserting any extra
   OAM packets.  This is called coloring based IP performance
   measurement.  This document specifies a framework and protocol for
   this "coloring" based IP performance measurement.

1.  Introduction

   Performance Measurement (PM) is an important tool that can not only
   provide Service Level Agreement (SLA) verification but facilitate in
   trouble shooting (e.g., fault localization or fault delimitation) and
   network visualization.

   There are two types of performance measurement: one is active
   performance measurement, and the other is passive performance
   measurement.

   In active performance measurement the receiver measures the injected
   packets to evaluate the performance of a path.  The active
   measurement measures the performance of the extra injected packets,
   the rate, numbers and interval of the injected packets will largely
   affect the accuracy of the results.  In addition, it also requires
   that the injected packets have to follow the same path as the real
   traffic; this normally cannot be guaranteed in the pure IP network.
   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) [RFC4656] and Two-Way
   Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357] are tools to enable
   active performance measurement.

   In passive performance measurement, no artificial traffic is injected
   into the flow and measurements are taken to record the performance
   metrics of the real traffic.  The Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) PM protocol [RFC6374] for packet loss is an example of passive
   performance measurement.  By periodically inserting auxiliary
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) packets, the
   traffic is delimited by the OAM packets into consecutive blocks, and
   the receivers count the packets and calculate the packets loss each
   block.

   But, when the OAM channel is in-band, solutions like [RFC6374] are
   not pure passive measurement as the OAM packets are inserted into the
   data stream.  Furthermore because solutions like [RFC6374] depend on
   the fixed positions of the delimiting OAM packets for packets
   counting, they are vulnerable to out-of-order arrival of packets.
   This could happen particularly with out-of-band OAM channels, but
   might also happen with in-band OAM because of the presence of
   multipath forwarding within the network.  Out of order delivery of
   data and the delimiting OAM can give rise to inaccuracies in the
   performance measurement figures.  The scale of these inaccuracies
   will depend on data speeds and the variation in delivery, but with
   out-of-band OAM, this could result in significant differences between
   real and reported performance.

   This document describes a mechanism where data packets are marked or
   "colored" so that they form blocks of data.  No additional delimiting

   OAM is needed and the performance can be measured in-service without
   the insertion of additional traffic.  Furthermore, because coloring
   based IP performance measurement does not require extra OAM packets
   for traffic delimitation, it can be used in situations where there is
   packets re-ordering.  This document specifies a framework and
   protocol for the "coloring" based IP performance measurement.

3.  Overview and Concept

   The concept of "coloring" IP packets for performance measurement is
   described in [I-D.tempia-opsawg-p3m].  By "coloring" the packets of a
   specific IP flow to different colors, it naturally splits the IP flow
   into deferent consecutive blocks.

   For packet loss measurement, there are two ways to color packets:
   fixed packet numbers or fixed time period for each color block.  This
   document only talks about the way of fixed time period.  The sender
   and receiver nodes count the transmitted and received packets/octets
   based on each color block.  By collecting and comparing the
   transmitted and received packets/octets, it can easily detect whether
   there is packet loss and how many packets/octets get lost.

   For packet delay measurement, there are two solutions.  One is
   similar to packet loss, it still colors the IP flow to different



Chen, et al.             Expires August 21, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Colouring based IP FPM Framework       February 2013


   color blocks and uses the time when color changing as the reference
   time for delay calculation.  This solution requires that there must
   not be any out-of-order packets, otherwise, the result will not be
   accurate.  Because it uses the first packet of each color block for
   delay measurement, if there is packet reordering, the first packet of
   each block at the sender will be probably different from the first
   packet of the block at the receiver.  The other way is to
   periodically color a single packet of the IP flow.  Within a time
   period, there is only one packet can be colored.  The sender records
   the timestamp when the colored packet is transmitted, the receiver
   records the timestamp when detecting the colored packet.  With the
   two timestamps, the packet delay can be computed.

   To make the above solutions work, two conditions are required.  The
   first one is that there have to be a way to collect the packet counts
   and timestamps from the senders and receivers to a centralized
   calculation element.  The second is that the centralized calculation
   element has to know what exactly a pair of packet counts(one from the
   sender and the other is from the receiver) are based on the same
   color block and a pair of timestamps (one from the sender and the
   other is from the receiver) are based on the same colored packet.


4.  Reference Model and Functional Components

4.1.  Reference Model

   An Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) reference model (as shown in
   Figure 1) is introduced in this document.  For a specific IP flow,
   there may be one or more upstream and downstream Measurement Points
   (MPs).  An IP flow can be identified by the Source IP (SIP) and
   Destination IP (DIP) addresses, and it may combine the SIP and DIP
   with any or all of the Protocol number, the Source port, the
   Destination port, and the Type of Service (TOS) to identify an IP
   flow.

   An MP is a network node.  From the measurement point of view, it
   consists of two parts (as shown in Figure 2): Data Collecting Point
   (DCP), and Target Logical Port (TLP).  For an MP, there is only one
   DCP and may be one or more TLPs.  The Measurement Control Point (MCP)
   is a centralized calculation element, MPs periodically report their
   measurement data to the MCP for final performance calculation.  The
   report protocol is defined Section 5 of this document.

   The reason for choosing MP2MP model is that it can satisfy all the
   scenarios that include Point-to-Point (P2P), Point-to-Multipoint
   (P2MP), Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P), and MP2MP.  P2P scenario is
   obvious and can be used anywhere.  P2MP and MP2P are very common in

   mobile backhaul networks.  For example, a Cell Site Gateway (CSG)
   multi-homing to two Radio Network Controller (RNC) Site Gateways
   (RSGs) is a typical network design.  When there is a failure, there
   is a requirement to monitor the flows between the CSG and the two
   RSGs hence to determine whether the fault is in the transport network
   or in the wireless network(this is normally called "fault
   delimitation").  This is especially useful in the situation where the
   transport network belongs to one service provider and wireless
   network belongs to other service providers.

4.2.  Measurement Control Point

   The MCP is responsible for calculating the final performance metrics
   according to the received measurement data from the MPs (actually
   from the DCPs).  For packet loss, based on each color block, the
   difference between the total counts received from all upstream MPs
   and the total counts received from all downstream MPs are the lost
   packet numbers.  The MCP must make sure that the counts from the
   upstream MPs and downstream MPs are related to the same color block.
   For packet delay (e.g., one way delay), the difference between the
   timestamps from the downstream MP and upstream MP is the packet
   delay.  Similarly to packet loss, the MCP must make sure the two
   timestamps are based on the same colored packet.

Internet-Draft      Colouring based IP FPM Framework       February 2013


   This document introduces a Period Number (PN) based synchronization
   mechanism to help the MCP to determine whether any two or more packet
   counts (from distributed MPs) are related to the same color block or
   any two timestamps are related to the same colored packet.  The PN is
   generated each time a DCP reads the packet counts and timestamps from
   the TLP, and is equal to the modulo of the local time (when the
   counts and timestamps are read) and the interval of the color time
   period.  Each packet count and timestamp has a PN when reported to
   the MCP, and the same PN means that they are related to the same
   color block or colored packet.  This requires that the upstream and
   downstream MPs having a certain time synchronization capability
   (e.g., supporting the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905], or the
   IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) [IEEE1588].) and assumes that
   the upstream and downstream MPs have already time synchronized.
   Since is the intention to measure packet delay, this requirement for
   time synchronization is already present.

4.3.  Data Collecting Point

   The DCP is responsible for periodically collecting the measurement
   data from the TLPs and for reporting the data to the MCP.  In
   addition, when to change the color, when to color a packet (for
   packet delay measurement), and when to read the packet counts and
   timestamps are also controlled by DCP.  Each DCP will maintain two
   timers, one (C-timer, used at upstream DCP) is for color changing,
   the other (R-timer, used at downstream DCP) is for reading the packet
   counts and timestamps.  The two timers have the same time interval
   but are started at different times.  A DCP can be either an upstream
   or a downstream DCP: the role is specific to an IP flow.  For a
   specific IP flow, the upstream DCP will change the color and read the
   packet counts and timestamps when the C-timer expires, the downstream
   DCP just reads the packets counts and timestamps when the R-timer
   expires.  In order to allow for a certain degree of packets re-
   ordering, the R-timer should be started later than a defined period
   of time after the C-timer is started (e.g., 1/3 or 2/3 T, where T is
   the interval of the C-timer).  It recommends that: for packet loss
   measurement, the R-timer should be started at 1/3 T after the C-Timer
   is started, and for packet delay measurement, the R-timer should be
   started at 2/3 T after the C-Timer is started.

   To make the implementation simple, the C-timer should be started at
   the beginning of each time period.  This document recommends the
   implementation to support at least these time periods (1s, 10s, 1min,
   10min and 1h).  So, if the time period is 10s, the C-timer should be
   started at the time of any multiples of 10 in seconds (e.g., 0s, 10s,
   20s, etc.), then the R-timer should be started, for example, at the
   time of T+1/3 or 2/3 T. With this method, each DCP can independently
   start its C-timer and R-timer given that the clocks have been

   synchronized.

4.4.  Target Logical Port

   The TLP is a logical entity that actually executes the final
   measurement actions (e.g., colors the packets, counts the packets,
   records the timestamps, etc.).  Normally, a physical interface
   corresponds to a TLP, and the TLP resides in the data plane.  For a
   measurement instance (corresponding to an IP flow), a TLP will
   maintain a pairs of packet counters and a timestamp counter for each
   color block.  One packet counter is for counting packets and the
   other is for counting octets.


5.  Colouring based Performance Measurement Protocol

   This section is a preliminary documentation of CPMP.  More details
   will be supplied in a future version of this document.

   The Coloring-based Performance Measurement Protocol (CPMP) is defined
   for communication between DCP and MCP.  An MCP may use it to enable/
   disable a measurement instance on DCPs, and DCPs use it to
   periodically report measurement data to the MCP.  The CPMP uses TCP
   as the transport protocol, a dedicated TCP port is required.  The MCP
   listens on the port and accept the connect request from DCPs.  So,
   DCPs must know where the MCP is, this could be done by configuration
   when creating a measurement instance.

5.1.  Common Message Header

   There are 4 messages defined in this document, which include Open
   Message, KeepAlive Message, Configure Message and Report Message.
   Each message has a common header as follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3

5.2.  Open Message

   After a TCP session between a DCP and MCP is established, the Open
   Message is the first message sent by the MCP to the DCP or the DCP to
   the MCP hence to establish a CPMP session.  The format of Open
   Message is as follows:

5.3.  KeepAlive Message

   A Keepalive message is sent by a DCP or a MCP in order to keep the
   CPMP session in active state.  The Keepalive message is also used in
   response to an Open message to acknowledge that an Open message has
   been received and that the CPMP session characteristics are
