1.  Background

   Many Chinese people are attending IETF meetings and joining mailing
   list discussions (around 150 according to IETF Chairman report at
   Operation Plenary).  Although their names are spelt using English
   letters, it is always not easy for English speakers to pronounce
   them.  The essential problem is that there was not a standard while
   translating or mapping the Chinese names to English letters at the
   time.  This document will not go into the details of the why this is
   the fact, but rather would like to serve as a tutorial for English
   speakers to pronounce Chinese spellings especially names correctly.

   There are several translating systems from Chinese characters to
   Latin script, including Pinyin, Webster and Zhuyin.  Most people are
   using Pinyin now, which is the focus of this document.  This document
   will not help you if you encounter names spelt in other systems.

   Most of the contents are referred to [Pinyin].  This document is not
   to accomplish a comprehensive eduation of pronunciation, but to
   eduate people to start with some basic knowledge and would like to
   serve as a guide that that IETF people can drop by and get the
   correct pronounce in a quick way.

   We also have submitted a companion document on how to call Chinese
   people in an authentic way, i.e. http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-deng-
   call-chinese-names.

2.  The Pinyin system

   Pinyin is the official phonetic system for transcribing the sound of
   Chinese characters into Latin script in China.  It is often used to
   teach Standard Chinese and spell Chinese names in foreign
   publications and may be used as an input method to enter Chinese

   characters (Hanzi) into computers.  'Pinyin' literally means
   "spelled-out sounds."

   The pinyin system was developed in the 1950s based on earlier forms
   of romanization.  It was published by the Chinese government in 1958
   and revised several times.  The International Organization for
   Standardization adopted pinyin as the international standard in 1982.

3.  How to Pronounce Pinyin Words

   I will describe the simple way to learn the pronouncing system as
   below.

   1.  Divide the Pinyin syllable into one 'Initial' and one 'Final'

   2.  Learn how to pronounce the 'Initial' per introduction in
       Section 3.1

   3.  Learn how to pronounce the 'Final' per introduction in
       Section 3.2

   4.  Combine what you get from Step 2&3, and speak out (do not be
       afraid of making mistakes :))

3.2.  How to Pronounce 'Finals'

   'Finals' come after 'Initials'.  Generally they are more difficult to
   pronounce than 'Initials'.  But the good thing is, unlike English
   equivalent, they have only one way to pronounce.  Compared to 'ough'
   in 'Cough' and 'rough', 'cought', etc., 'Finals' are more stable.

                Figure 2: How to pronounce Finals in Pinyin

4.  Examples

   For example, how to pronounce my first name Zhen and last name Cao.
   For 'zhen', we can divide it into initial 'zh' and final 'en', and
   then go and find them in Figure 1 and Figure 2.  Okay, you will find
   them in the tables, 'zh' pronounces like 'ch', and 'en' follows its
   pronunciation in 'taken', so you will know how to pronounce it in a
   combination.  For 'Cao', it will be similar, you can take it as an
   execise and confirm with me on future IETF meetings :).

   Take Hui Deng as another example, 'Hui' can be devided into
   'h'(initial) and 'ui' (final), and you can speak out.  'Deng' can be
   devided into 'd' and 'eng'.  As in Figure 2, 'g' is silent.

5.  Pronounciation Dictionary for Chinese Participants

   This section intends to serve as a pronounciation dictionary for
   Chinese participants in IETF.

   Note: please advise an efficient way to accomplish this task, to
   benifit communication between working group chairs and working group
   participants from China.
