INTERNET DRAFT                 VXLAN-EVPN              February 18, 2013


1  Introduction

   [E-VPN] introduces a solution for multipoint L2VPN services, with
   advanced multi-homing capabilities, using BGP for distributing
   customer/client MAC (C-MAC) address reach-ability information over
   the core MPLS/IP network. [VXLAN] defines a a tunneling scheme to
   overlay Layer 2 networks on top of Layer 3 networks. Similar to
   [TRILL], [VXLAN] allows for optimal forwarding of Ethernet frames
   with support for multipathing of unicast and multicast traffic. VXLAN
   uses an IP/UDP encapsulation for tunneling. In this document, we
   discuss how Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) technology can be used to
   interconnect VXLAN networks over an MPLS/IP network, while
   guaranteeing C-MAC address transparency on the hand-off point and
   control-plane isolation among the interconnected VXLAN networks.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Requirements

2.1. C-MAC Address Transparency on the Hand-off Point

   When VXLAN networks are interconnected over an MPLS/IP network, it is
   required to maintain C-MAC address transparency on the hand-off point
   and the edge (i.e. PE) of the MPLS network. Otherwise, the MPLS edge
   nodes may suffer from MAC address table space exhaustion, as they
   would need to learn the C-MAC addresses from all interconnected VXLAN
   networks.

   VXLAN-EVPN supports seamless interconnect with VXLAN while
   guaranteeing C-MAC address transparency on the PE nodes.

2.2. Control Plane Isolation among VXLAN Networks

   It is required to maintain control-plane isolation among the various
   VXLAN networks being interconnected over the MPLS/IP network. This
   ensures the following characteristics:

   - scalability of the IGP control plane in large deployments and fault
   domain localization, where link or node failures in one site do not
   trigger reconvergence in remote sites.

   - scalability of multicast trees as the number of interconnected
   networks scales.


3. Solution Overview

   Every VXLAN network that is connected to the MPLS core runs an
   independent instance of the IGP control-plane. Each PE participates
   in the IGP control plane instance of its local site. The PE does not
   terminate the VXLAN data-plane encapsulation. The PE nodes
   encapsulate VXLAN IP/UDP packets with MPLS in the imposition path,
   and de-capsulate them in the disposition path.

4.  EVPN Routes

   VXLAN-EVPN leverages the same BGP Routes and Attributes defined in
   [E-VPN], adapted as follows:

4.1.  BGP MAC Advertisement Route

   This route and its associated modes are not needed in VXLAN-EVPN.

4.2.  Ethernet Auto-Discovery Route

INTERNET DRAFT                 VXLAN-EVPN              February 18, 2013


   This route and its associated modes are not needed in VXLAN-EVPN.

4.3.  Per VPN Route Targets

   VXLAN-EVPN uses the same set of route targets defined in [E-VPN]. 

4.4  Inclusive Multicast Route

   The E-VPN Inclusive Multicast route is used to distribute the VNI
   information over the MPLS network. This is required to perform the
   discovery of the PEs participating in a given VNI. It also enables
   the stitching of the IP multicast trees, which are local to each
   VXLAN site, with the Label Switched Multicast (LSM) trees of the MPLS
   network.

   The Inclusive Multicast Route is encoded as follow:

   - Ethernet Tag ID is set to VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI).

   - Originating Router's IP Address is set to one of the PE's IP
   addresses.

   All other fields are set as defined in [E-VPN].

   Please see section 4.6  "Handling Multicast"

4.5.  Unicast Forwarding

   TBD

4.6. Handling Multicast

   Each VXLAN network independently builds its P2MP or MP2MP shared
   multicast trees. A P2MP or MP2MP tree is built for every VNI local to
   the VXLAN network. 

   In the MPLS/IP network, multiple options are available for the
   delivery of multicast traffic:
      - Ingress replication
      - LSM with Inclusive trees
      - LSM with Aggregate Inclusive trees
      - LSM with Selective trees
      - LSM with Aggregate Selective trees
   When LSM is used, the trees may be either P2MP or MP2MP.

   The PE nodes are responsible for stitching the IP multicast trees, on
   the access side, to the ingress replication tunnels or LSM trees in
   the MPLS/IP core. The stitching must ensure that the following

   characteristics are maintained at all times:

   1. Avoiding Packet Duplication: In the case where the VXLAN network
   is multi-homed to multiple PE nodes, if all of the PE nodes forward
   the same multicast frame, then packet duplication would arise. This
   applies to both multicast traffic from site to core as well as from
   core to site.

   2. Avoiding Forwarding Loops: In the case of VXLAN network multi-
   homing, the solution must ensure that a multicast frame forwarded by
   a given PE to the MPLS core is not forwarded back by another PE (in
   the same VXLAN network) to the VXLAN network of origin. The same
   applies for traffic in the core to site direction.

   3. Pacifying RPF Checks: For multicast traffic originating from a
   different VXLAN network, the RPF check shouldn't have an issue with
   PIM-BIDIR. 

   There are two approaches by which the above operation can be
   guaranteed: one offers per-VTEP source load-balancing while the other
   offers per- VNI load-balancing.

4.6.1. Multicast Stitching with Per-Source Load Balancing


   The PE nodes, connected to a multi-homed VXLAN network, perform BGP
   DF election to decide which PE is responsible for forwarding
   multicast traffic from a given source VTEP. A PE would only forward
   multicast traffic from source VTEP for which it is the DF, in both
   the site to core as well as core to site directions. This solves both
   the issue of avoiding packet duplication as well as the issue of
   avoiding forwarding loops.


4.6.2. Multicast Stitching with Per-VNI Load Balancing

   The PE nodes, connected to a multi-homed VXLAN network, perform BGP
   DF election to decide which PE node is responsible for forwarding
   multicast traffic associated with a given VNI. A PE would forward
   multicast traffic for a given VNI only when it is the DF for this
   VNI. This forwarding rule applies in both the site to core as well as
   core to site directions. 

5. NVGRE

   Just like VXLAN, NVGRE IP tunnels encapsulating Customer Ethernet
   Frames can be carried seamlessly over EVPN, all the above
   specification would apply for NVGRE, replacing the VNI with Virtual
