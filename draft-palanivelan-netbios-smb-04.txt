                    Server Message Block and NetBIOS
                    draft-palanivelan-netbios-smb-04


Abstract

   The Server Message Block (SMB) is a presentation layer protocol
   providing file and print sharing functions for LAN Manager, and other
   network operating systems. 

   The Network Basic I/O System (NetBIOS) NetBIOS was developed in the
   early 1980s to allow applications to communicate over a network. The
   TCP/IP version called NetBIOSoverTCP/IP(NetBT), was developed to
   support communications between symbolically named stations and
   transfer of arbitrary data.NetBT supports all three services (Name,
   Datagram and Session) supported by NetBIOS.

   This document attempts to provide, Control and Operational details on
   SMB over NetBT session, which is otherwise not clearly explained in
   the RFCs [Netbios concepts] and [Netbios specification] or any
   available documentation.

   This document is intended for documentation purpose and for
   informational use only.This document does not attempt to define a
   standard, rather tries explaining an existing implementation.

   This document puts together pieces of information scattered in
   multiple documents and offers a single complete documentation for
   this specific application (smb over NetBT).

1  Introduction

   NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT, or sometimes NetBT) is a networking
   protocol that allows legacy node applications relying on the NetBIOS
   API to scale for the modern TCP/IP networks.This shall support all
   the three NetBIOS services (given below) over secured tcp/ip
   connections.

   * Name service for name registration and resolution (port: 137)

   * Datagram distribution service for connectionless communication
   (port: 138)

   * Session service for connection-oriented communication (port: 139)

   The file and printer sharing services are provided by the Server
   Message Block (SMB) protocol. This shall run on top of NetBT session
   or run directly over TCP.


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Overview

   In NetBIOS, The following three services are supported.

   Name Service    :  Each participant must register on the network
   using a unique name of at most 16 characters. NetBT Name Service
   handles and records all name registrations.(Port: 137/UDP or 137/TCP)

   Datagram Service:  Datagram mode is connectionless. A datagram is
   sent to unique or multiple NetBIOS participants on the network.(Port
   138/UDP)

   Session Service :  Session mode lets two hosts in the network to
   access and transfer data in a secured way.(Port 139/TCP)

   Direct hosted "NetBIOS-less" SMB traffic uses port 445 (TCP and
   UDP)and SMB over NetBT uses the nbsession service Port (139/TCP).

   NetBT allows handling of larger messages, while also providing error
   detection and recovery.This document is focused on the NetBT Session
   service for message transfer between hosts, and hence shall discuss
   SMB and SMB over NetBT in detail.

3. Server Message Block packet structure

   Server Message Block (SMB) allows hosts to control sessions like
   share files, printers, disks etc. SMB thus enables access of shared
   resources between nodes across the network. SMB packet structure is
   given below.


                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   A successful connection from a client machine to the server returns a
   Treeid that identifies the transactions through this particular
   connection. Each of the operations from the client is identified by
   the caller process id (PID) and the userid (UID) is used for the
   authenticated requests/operations.

   Multiplexing the single client and server connection among the
   client's multiple processes, threads, and requests per thread is
   identified by the Multiplex id (MID).

   The Size of the data portion of the packet is given by Bytecount and
   the actual data follows this field.

4  Netbios Session Service Packet structure


   The [Netbios specification] describes the session service packet
   structure. File and printer services are the primary uses of the
   NetBIOS Session service.All session packets are of the following
   general structure:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |      TYPE     |     FLAGS     |            LENGTH             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   /               TRAILER (Packet Type Dependent)                 /
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The TYPE, FLAGS, and LENGTH fields are present in every session  
   packet.

   	TYPE - Message Type   ( SESSION MESSAGE 	
				SESSION REQUEST           		  
      				POSITIVE SESSION RESPONSE
	                        NEGATIVE SESSION RESPONSE
                              	RETARGET SESSION RESPONSE
	                        SESSION KEEP ALIVE )

   4.1  Session Message

   The actual data transfer in NetBT session is through session
   messages.The Session service Packet Type "Session message" is
   represented in hexadecimal as 00.

              00 -  SESSION MESSAGE

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

   The NetBT session is established on TCP port 139 and the data
   transfer is done through the session messages.The connection is then
   closed after the data transfer.  There may be one or more session
   messages during an active session based on the size of data.

5  File and Printer Sharing Operations 

   The file and printer sharing services are provided by the Server
   Message Block (SMB) protocol. This shall run on top of NetBT session
   or run directly over TCP. SMB fits well with the client-server
   topology, where client makes specific requests and the server
   responds accordingly.

   5.1 Direct hosted SMB

   Direct hosted SMB traffic uses port 445. This does not use NetBT.
   Here, a four-byte header precedes the SMB traffic. The first byte of
   this header is always 0x00, and the next three bytes are the length
   of the data.

   This is useful in systems that do not support NetBT and in network
   where NetBT is not preferred. 

   If the Client has NetBT disabled, it will always try to connect to
   the server at port 445 only. If the server answers on port 445, the
   session shall be established and continued on that port. If it
   doesn't answer, the session will fail completely.When the server has
   NetBT disabled, it shall listen on port 445 only and respond to
   requests to this port.

   5.2 SMB over NetBT

   If both the direct hosted and NetBT interfaces are enabled, both
   methods are tried at the same time and the first to respond is
   used.This allows interoperability with operating systems that do not
   support direct hosting of SMB traffic or NetBT. 

   5.2.1.  NetBT Session Establishment

   When the client and the remote machine have NetBT enabled, the
   Netbios Sessions are established by exchanging packets on TCP port
   139. The node establishing the session attempts to make a TCP
   connection to port 139 on the remote node/server.

   On establishing the TCP connection, the client then sends over this
   connection a "Session Request" packet with the NetBIOS names of the
   client to the NetBIOS name to remote machine/server.The remote node
   shall respond with a "Positive Session Response" indicating that a
   session can be established or a "Negative Session Response"
   indicating that no session can be established.

   Multiple sessions, each identified with a unique Transaction id, may
   exist between any pair of calling and called names.

   5.2.2 NetBT session Data Transfer

   Data is transmitted during an established session by Session Message
   packets. NetBIOS keep-alives are used on each connection to verify
   that both the server and workstation are still able to maintain their
   session.

   For file sharing or printer sharing services, the data transfer shall
   be through the SMB packets that are exchanged as NetBT session
   message packets.

   5.2.3 SMB Data transfer on NetBT

   On an established NetBT session,the client through SMB negotiates the
   SMB capabilities with the remote machine/server.This is done through
   SMB command "Negotiate protocol request" on NetBT session message
   which is responded by a"Negotiate protocol response". The negotiated
   SMB capabilities includes understanding long file names, extended
   attributes, and so on.

   All the SMB command messages go on top of the NetBT session message
   on port139.The flags field in the SMB header shall indicate the type
   of SMB command as request to the server or as response to the client
   or the redirector. SMB shall follow this with "Session setup and x
   request" command.The User and domain information of the connecting
   machine shall be recorded in the local system. The session setup
   request shall have the same process id (PID) as the Negotiate
   protocol request/response. This command is replied with a "session
   setup and x response" command for the same PID.

   SMB "Tree connect and X request" command shall follow the session
   setup. The "Path" field of this command shall contain the path of the
   shared resource in the remote machine/server, the client is
   requesting access. The remote machine shall respond with a "Tree
   connect and X response" for a successful tree connection with a
   unique TreeID.

   On establishing the tree connection, further network traffic shall be
   generated based on the operation performed including displaying
   directory, accessing data files, launching applications, etc. The
   subsequent transactions on this tree connection shall have matching
   TID,PID,UID information.

   The SMB data transfer typically uses "Read and x request", "Read and
   xresponse", "Write and x request" and "Write and x response"
   commands. "No more data from sender" flag set in these commands shall
   indicate that there is no more data to follow.

   The client machine sends a "close request"  command and the server
   shall acknowledge with a "close response". This may be followed by a
   further set of transactions on the same tree.

   The client may then request to close the tree connection with a "tree
   disconnect request".The remote machine/server releases the TID and
   responds with a "tree disconnect response".



   5.2.4 NetBT Session Close 	 The NetBT Sessions are closed by closing
   the TCP connection.When a user requests to close a session, the
   service first attempts a graceful close of the TCP connection.  If
   the connection does not close within the SSN_CLOSE_TIMEOUT the TCP
   connection is aborted. No matter how the TCP connection is
   terminated, the NetBIOS session service always closes the NetBIOS
   session.
