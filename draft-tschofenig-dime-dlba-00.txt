                   draft-tschofenig-dime-dlba-00.txt

Abstract

   This specification documents a Diameter Load Balancing Application
   (DLBA), which uses the normal Diameter application approach for the
   capability negotiation, propagation and management of Diameter load
   information between Diameter nodes to enable load balancing of
   Diameter requests.

1.  Introduction

   The problem statement for Diameter overload control can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-overload-reqs].  It describes the lack of support of
   conveying load information to enable load balancing of Diameter
   requests in case Diameter servers become overload and the inability
   of Diameter servers to communicate with Diameter clients to reject
   requests when they become severely overloaded.
   [I-D.tschofenig-dime-overload-arch] goes a step further in providing
   an outline of architectural principles and an information model.

   This document specifies Diameter Load Balancing Application (DLBA),
   which uses the AVPs defined in [I-D.tschofenig-dime-overload-arch].
   As the name indicates, this document focuses on load balancing.

   The Diameter Load Balancing Application (DLBA) typically runs between
   a load balancer and a Diameter server.  The load balancer may act as
   a DLBA client and the Diameter server as a DLBA server but the roles
   may also be reversed without loss in protocol functionality since
   Diameter is flexible as a protocol.  There may be zero or more
   intermediate Diameter agents on the path between the DLBA client and
   the DLBA server.  Understanding the DLBA functionality is not
   expected from relays and redirect agents.

   The main usage for this application is within a single realm, as
   shown in Figure 2 of [I-D.tschofenig-dime-overload-arch], where a
   load balancer distributes incoming Diameter requests to different
   Diameter servers.  Designing the load balancing functionality as a

   stand-alone application prevents Diameter servers and load balancers
   to adjust their information exchange frequency to meet the needs of
   the network administrator regardless of remaining Diameter
   application traffic.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Commands

   The DLBA-Report-Request message is used to request load information.

   <DLBA-Report-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: TBD2, REQ, PXY >
                             < Session-Id >
                             { Auth-Application-Id }
                             { Origin-Host }
                             { Origin-Realm }
                             { Destination-Realm }
                             { Auth-Request-Type }
                             { Destination-Host }
                             [ Auth-Session-State ]
                           * [ Class ]
                             [ Origin-State-Id ]
                           * [ Proxy-Info ]
                           * [ Route-Record ]

                             [ Supported-Features ]
                             [ Sending-Rate ]
                             [ Load-Info ]
                           * [ AVP ]


   The DLBA-Report-Answer message is used as a response to the DLBA-
   Report-Request.  The message MAY piggyback load information in order
   to avoid unnecessary DLBA-Report-Request messages in the reverse
   direction.

   <DLBA-Report-Answer> ::= < Diameter Header: TBD2, PXY >
                          < Session-Id >
                          { Result-Code }
                          { Origin-Host }
                          { Origin-Realm }
                          [ Auth-Session-State ]
                        * [ Class ]
                          [ Error-Message ]

                          [ Failed-AVP ]
                          [ Origin-State-Id ]

                          [ Redirect-Max-Cache-Time ]
                        * [ Proxy-Info ]

                          [ Supported-Features ]
                          [ Sending-Rate ]
                          [ Load-Info ]
                        * [ AVP ]


   Diameter is flexible from a message handling point of view.
   Therefore, any the DLBA capable Diameter node, such as a load
   balancer or a Diameter server, MAY initiate a DLBA-Report-Request at
   any given time.  The receiver of the DLBA-Report-Request responds
   with a DLBA-Report-Answer and includes the Result-Code AVP indicating
   whether it could honor the action/report in the request.  The DLBA-
   Report-Answer SHOULD also piggyback load information.

   A DLBA client MUST set the Auth-Session-State AVP to the value
   NO_STATE_MAINTAINED and SHOULD include load information into the
   DLBA-Report-Request message, if available.  The DLBA-Report-Response
   message MUST contain the Auth-Session-State AVP set to value
   NO_STATE_MAINTAINED.

4.  Attribute Value Pair Flag Rules

5.  Example

   This example shows the simplicity of the DLBA application.  Here the
   load balancer initiates the DLBA exchange and solicits load
   information from a Diameter server.  The rate at which these messages
   are exchange depend on the Sending-Rate AVP.  The Diameter server
   may, however, at any time send an unsolicited DLBA-Report-Request
   message in case the load situation changes unexpectedly.

       |                               |

       |    Load AVP                   |

       :                               :
       :                               :
       |                               |
       |...more load info exchanges... |
       |                               |
       |                               |


6.  Transport Considerations

   In case of Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) transport, it
   is RECOMMENDED to mark Diameter packets using the DLBA defined SCTP
   Payload Protocol Identifier (PPID) TBD1.  The PPID MAY be used by
   intermediating network nodes or agents to peek into SCTP message and
   find out that this is about overload control.  Such information can
   be used for prioritizing SCTP packet handling as an example.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Application Identifiers

   This specification reserves a new Diameter Application-ID TBD14 for
   the Diameter Load Balancing Application (DLBA) from the
   'Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Parameters'
   Application IDs registry.

Internet-Draft                    DLBA                         July 2013


7.2.  SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier

   Section 6 reserves a new SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier for the
   DLBA application usage.  The value is reserved from the existing SCTP
   Payload Protocol Identifiers registry.

7.3.  Command Codes

   Two command codes are defined in Section 3.  The DLBA-Report-Request
   Command Code is TBD and the DLBA-Report-Answer Command Code is TBD.
   Both are allocated from the 'Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting (AAA) Parameters' Command Codes registry.

7.4.  Result-Code Values

   This specification adds Diameter Overload Control Application
   specific Permanent Failure codes from the 'Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Parameters' Result-Code AVP
   Values (code 268) - Permanent Failure registry:

   AVP Values | Attribute Name                | Reference
   -----------+-------------------------------+----------
    5xxx      | DIAMETER_RATE_TOO_BIG         | RFCxxxx
    5xxx      | DIAMETER_NO_COMMON-FEATURES   | RFCxxxx


8.  Security Considerations

   This Diameter application uses the Diameter [RFC6733] security
   mechanisms and, what is more important, is primarily used within a
   single realm to allow a load balancer to obtain load information from
   Diameter servers for distributing Diameter requests depending on the
   utilization of these servers.  Passing load information beyond an
   administrative domain is possible with Diameter but not advisable to
   avoid leaking valuable information to potentially untrustworthy
   parties.
