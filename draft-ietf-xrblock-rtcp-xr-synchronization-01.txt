Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks               October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines two new block types to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The first new block type supports reporting of Initial
   Synchronization Delay to establish multimedia session.  Information
   is recorded about time difference between the start of RTP sessions
   and the time the RTP receiver acquires all components of RTP sessions
   in the multimedia session [RFC6051].

   The second new block type supports reporting of the relative
   synchronization offset time of two arbitrary streams (e.g., between
   audio and video streams), with the same RTCP CNAME included in RTCP
   SDES packets [RFC3550].  Information is recorded about the
   synchronization offset time of each RTP stream relative to the
   reference RTP stream with the same CNAME and General Synchronization
   Offset of zero.

   These metrics belong to the class of transport level metrics defined
   in [MONARCH].


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Initial Synchronization Delay:

      A multimedia session comprises a set of concurrent RTP sessions
      among a common group of participants, using one RTP session for
      each media type.  The initial synchronization Delay is the average
      time for receiver to synchronize all components of a multimedia
      session [RFC6051].

   Synchronization Offset:

      Synchronization between two media streams must be maintained to
      ensure satisfactory QoE.  Two media streams can be of the same
      media type belonging to one RTP session or in different media
      types belonging to one multimedia session.  The Synchronization
      Offset is the relative time difference of the two media streams

      that need to be synchronized.



3.  Applicability

   The report blocks defined in this document could be used by dedicated
   network monitoring applications.

   When joining each session in layered video sessions [RFC6190] or the
   multimedia session, a receiver may not synchronize playout across the
   multimedia session or layered video session until RTCP SR packets
   have been received on all components of RTP sessions.  The component
   RTP session are referred to as each RTP session for each media type
   in multimedia session or separate RTP session for each layer in the
   layered video session.  For unicast session, the delay due to
   negotiation of NAT pinholes, firewall holes, quality-of-service, and
   media security keys is contributed to such initial synchronization
   playout.  For multicast session, such initial synchronization delay
   varies with the session bandwidth, the number of members, and the
   number of senders in the session.  The RTP flow Initial
   synchronization delay block can be used to report the initial
   synchronization delay to receive all the RTP streams belonging to the
   same multimedia session or layered video session.  In the absence of
   packet loss, the initial synchronization delay equals to the average
   time taken to receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP session with
   the longest RTCP reporting interval.  In the presence of packet loss,
   the media synchronization needs to based on the in-band mapping of
   RTP and NTP-format timestamps [RFC6051] or wait until the reporting
   interval has passed, and the next RTCP SR packet is sent.

   In an RTP multimedia session, there can be an arbitrary number of
   streams carried in different RTP sessions, with the same RTCP CNAME.
   These streams may be not synchronized with each other.  For example,
   one audio stream and one video stream belong to the same session and
   audio stream are transmitted lag behind video stream for multiple
   tens of milliseconds [TR-126].  The RTP Flows Synchronization Offset
   block can be used to report such synchronization offset between video
   stream and audio stream.


4.  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block

   This block is sent by RTP receivers and reports Initial
   synchronization delay beyond the information carried in the standard
   RTCP packet format.  Information is recorded about time difference
   between the start of RTP sessions and the time the RTP receiver
   acquires all components of RTP sessions [RFC6051].

4.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block has the
   following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow Initial Synchronization Delay
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block is
      identified by the constant <RFISD>.

   Reserved: 8 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the media source SHALL be set to the value of the SSRC
      identifier carried in any arbitrary component of RTP sessions
      belonging to the same multimedia session.

   Initial Synchronization Delay: 32 bits

      The average delay, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, from the
      RTCP packets received on all of the components RTP sessions to the
      beginning of session [RFC6051].  The value is calculated based on
      received RTCP SR packets or the RTP header extension containing
      in-band mapping of RTP and NTP-format timestamps [RFC6051].  If
      there is no packet loss, the initial synchronization delay is



Asaeda, et al.           Expires April 21, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks               October 2012


      expected to be equal to the average time taken to receive the
      first RTCP packet in the RTP session with the longest RTCP
      reporting interval or the average time taken to receive the first
      RTP header extension containing in-band mapping of RTP and NTP-
      format timestamps.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 SHOULD be reported.


5.  RTP Flows Synchronization Offset Metrics Block

   In the RTP multimedia sessions, there can be an arbitrary number of
   Media streams and each media stream (e.g., audio stream or video
   stream) is sent in a separate RTP stream.  The receiver associates
   RTP streams to be synchronized by means of RTCP CNAME contained in
   the RTCP Source Description (SDES) packets [RFC3550].

   This block is sent by RTP receivers and reports synchronization
   offset of the arbitrary two RTP streams that needs to be synchronized
   in the RTP multimedia session.  Information is recorded about the
   relative time difference between two media streams with the same
   CNAME.  In two media streams, one media stream is the reference
   stream, which can be chosen as the arbitrary stream with minimum
   delay according to the common criterion defined in section 6.2.2.1 of
   [Y.1540].

5.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block has the
   following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

5.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block is
      identified by the constant <RFSO>.

   Lag and Lead Indication (L): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the reporting stream lead
      before the reference stream or lag behind the reference stream.
      The value of this field is set to 1, if the reporting stream lead
      before the reference stream, 0 otherwise.

   Reserved: 7 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 4, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the media source SHALL be set to the value of the SSRC
      identifier of the reporting RTP stream to which the XR relates.

   SSRC of Reference: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the reference stream SHALL be set to the value of the
      SSRC identifier of the reference RTP stream to which the XR
      relates.

   Synchronization Offset: 64 bits

      The synchronization offset of the reporting RTP stream relative to
      the reference RTP stream with the same CNAME.  The calculation of
      Synchronization Offset is similar to Difference D calculation in
      the RFC3550.  That is to say,if Si is the RTP timestamp from the
      reporting RTP packet i, and Ri is the time of arrival in RTP
      timestamp units for reporting RTP packet i, Sj is the RTP
      timestamp from the reference RTP packet j, and Rj is the time of
      arrival in RTP timestamp units for reference RTP packet j, then
      the value of the synchronization offset D may be expressed as

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks               October 2012


         D(i,j) = (Rj - Ri) - (Sj - Si) = (Rj - Sj) - (Ri - Si)
      The value of the synchronization offset is represented using a 64-
      bit NTP-format timestamp as defined in [RFC5905], which is 64-bit
      unsigned fixed-point number with the integer part in the first 32
      bits and the fractional part in the last 32 bits.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 SHOULD be reported.


6.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

6.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   Two new parameters are defined for the two report blocks defined in
   this document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].
   They have the following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute
   [RFC3611]:

     rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                           [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

     xr-format = RTP-flows-init-syn-delay
               / RTP-flows-syn-offset

     RTP-flows-init-syn-delay = "RTP-flows-init-syn-delay"
     RTP-flow-syn-offset = "RTP-flows-syn-offset"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.

6.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] applies.


7.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].
