        IPv6 Transition Technologies Selection using DHCP/DHCPv6
                  draft-yang-v6ops-ipv6tran-select-02

Abstract

   Nowadays, many IPv6 transition technologies has been proposed, such
   as Dual-Stack, DS-Lite, 6rd and so on.  An CPE may support some of
   them instead of only one.  But ISPs usually deploy just an unique
   transition technology in an area, for example, under a BRAS/SR or in
   a MAN.  So they must control all the CPEs to ues the exact transition
   tech through the CPEs' management system or configuring them before
   issuing to the customers.  Another question is that if subscriber buy
   a new CPE from supermarket to substitute the one received from the
   ISP, he may not access internet because of the wrong configuration.

   To solve these problems,this document defines a new DHCP/DHCPv6
   option named TRAN_TYPE which can control CPEs to select the
   appropriate IPv6 transition technology which ISP deployed instend of
   the CPEs' default configration.  This method can also solve the
   configurating problem when various CPEs work together without a
   uniform configuration in advance.

1.  Introduction

   Nowadays, many IPv6 transitioning technologies has been proposed such
   as Dual-Stack, DS-Lite, 6rd and so on.  Each of them proposes
   individual requirment to the CPEs.  To promote the competitive
   ability of products,the CPE manufacturers certainly will try to
   support more technologies as much as possible.  Meanwhile, the
   operators tend to use single or less technologies.  Moreover, users
   can buy and use their own equipments instead of using the one which
   operator gives them, that will bring the diversity of CPEs.

   Assume that an operator uses one transitioning strategy in its
   network.  There are two ways to make the CPEs available.  The first
   one is to make a pre-configuration for each CPE in advance.  But,
   when the users modify the configuration or change to their own
   equipment, the connection will fail.  The Second method is to deploy
   Network Management System (NMS) to configurate all the CPEs.  Various
   CPEs from different manufactories usually need different NMS which
   means either the operator needs to maintains multiple NMS in their
   network or operator can only use one manufacturer's product in a
   subnet.  What's worse, when users buy and use their own CPE instead
   of using the original one, there will be no any solutions to
   configurate correctly except visiting service.

   DHCP and DHCPv6 solutions are presented in this document to solve the
   problem mentioned above.  By supporting this option, the operator can
   configurate the CPEs simple and directly by delivering DHCP or DHCPv6
   options.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  DHCP Solution

   DHCP protocol will be used during the configuration process of CPE in
   IPoE scenario.  Here, a new option named OPTION_TRAN_TYPE is defined.
   This option is sent by a server to a CPE to affect the selection of
   transition strategy by the client.

   The format of the OPTION_TRAN_TYPE option is:

   The process of this operation is:

   1.  The DHCP module in CPE broadcasts the Discover Message.

   2.  The DHCP module in Server (such as BRAS/SR) replies the Offer
   Message.

   3.  CPE MUST send Request message with OPTION_TRAN_TYPE option code
   in option55[Parameter Request List, RFC2131,section 9.8] to Server.

   4.  Server replies ACK message with OPTION_TRA_TYPE option to CPE,
   which may allow or allocate a transition strategy (such as mode = 1).

   A server MAY include a TRAN_TYPE option in any DHCP message to
   control the transition strategy selection of the CPE, including
   Discover, Offer, Request, Reply, and Inform Messages.

   The server can also send the OPTION_TRA_TYPE option in Offer Message
   or ACK Message directly without the request OPTION code in Discover
   or Request Message from CPE.

   To avoid OPTION_TRAN_TYPE meanings ambiguity, the 'mode' field must
   be consisitent in any CPE and server.  The list of all the transition
   technologies must be defined by IANA or other organizations.  For
   example, the 'mode' field list is set as below.

4.  DHCPv6 Solution

   In IPv6oE scenario, CPE must support DHCPv6 which can be used during
   the configuration process.  As above, we can also define a new option
   named OPTION_TRAN_TYPE to unify the transition technology of CPE and
   server.  This option is sent by a server to a CPE to affect the
   selection of transition strategy of the client.

   The format of the OPTION_TRAN_TYPE option is:


      0                   1                   2                   3

   Advertise Message.

   3.  CPE MUST send Request message with OPTION_TRAN_TYPE option code
   in Option Request Option [RFC3115,section 22.7] to Server.

   4.  Server replies Confirm message with OPTION_TRAN_TYPE option to
   CPE, which may allow or allocate a transition strategy (such as mode
   = 1).

   A server MAY include a TRAN_TYPE option in any DHCPv6 message to
   control the transition strategy selection of the CPE, including
   Solicit, Advertise, Request, Confirm, Renew, Rebind, Information-
   Request Messages.

   The server can also send the OPTION_TRA_TYPE option in Advertise
   Message or Confirm Message directly without the request OPTION in
   Solicit or Request Message from CPE.

   To avoid OPTION_TRAN_TYPE meanings ambiguity, the 'mode' field must
   be consisitent in any CPE and server in the same way in DHCP.


5.  Other questions

   1.  If there is a DHCP/DHCPv6 Relay between the CPE and server, it
   must forward the messages including this option transparently.

   2.  Why choose DHCP and DHCPv6 to take this important option, not
   just one of them?  Because some of the transition technologies only
   use IPv4 or IPv6 in the CPEs' WAN interface.  Obviously, if CPE
   choose 6RD as its default transition technology, it can only support
   DHCP.  Contrarily, DS-Lite CPE only support IPv6 in its WAN in the
   default configuration.  Of course, we can deploy any type of tunnels
   to transport DHCPv4 over IPv6 networks, as summarized in the draft of
   "Provisioning IPv4 Configuration Over IPv6 Only Networks".

   3.  Although DHCP/DHCPv6 must be used in IPoE scenario, it may not be
   launched in PPPoE network, which is a popular protocol in the fixed
   access networks.  Then we must deploy DHCP/DHCPv6 after the IPCP/
   IPCPv6 precess to solve this problem.

   4.  We can add a new similar option in RA instead of that in DHCPv6.
   The discussion between RA and DHCPv6 is not included in this draft.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security problem is under disscussion.

7.  IANA Considerations

   1.  IANA is requested to assign an option code from the "DHCP Option
   Codes" and "DHCPv6 Option Codes" Registry for OPTION_TRAN_TYPE.

   2.  IANA is also requested to assign a uniform serial number for the
   'mode' field.
