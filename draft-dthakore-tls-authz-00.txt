  Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authorization Using DTCP Certificate
                      draft-dthakore-tls-authz-00

Abstract

   This document specifies the use of DTCP certificate as an
   authorization extension in the Transport Layer Security Handshake
   Protocol, according to guidelines in RFC 5878.  Extensions carried in
   the client and server Hello messages confirm that both parties
   support the desired authorization data types.  Then if supported by
   both the client and server, DTCP certificates are exchanged in the
   supplemental data handshake TLS handshake message as specified in
   RFC4680.

Internet-Draft             TLS Auth Using DTCP              October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol (TLS1.0 [RFC2246], TLS1.1
   [RFC4346], TLS1.2 [RFC5246]) is being used in an increasing variety
   of operational environments, the most common among which is its use
   in securing HTTP traffic ([RFC2818]).  RFC 5878 [AUTHZ] introduces
   extensions that enable TLS to operate in environments where
   authorization information needs to be exchanged between the client
   and the server before any protected data is exchanged.  The use of
   these TLS authorization extensions is especially attractive since it
   can allow the client and server to determine the type of protected
   data to exchange based on the authorization information received in
   the extensions.

   A number of consumer electronics devices such as TV's, tablets, game
   consoles, settop boxes and other multimedia devices contain Digital
   Transmission Licensing Administrator [DTLA] issued Digital
   Transmission Content Protection [DTCP] certificates.  These
   certificates are used for link protection over various types of links
   like DTCP over IP [DTCP-IP] to securely transmit premium audio visual
   content between devices.  These DTCP certificates can also be used to
   verify device functionality, other than link protection.

   This document describes the format and necessary identifiers to
   exchange DTCP certificates inside a TLS exchange.  This credential
   exchange allows a client and/or server to perform certain actions or
   provide specific services.  The DTCP certificate is cryptographically
   tied to the X.509 certificate being used during the TLS tunnel
   establishment by an EC-DSA [DTCP] signature.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

2.1.  Overview of Supplemental Data handshake

   Figure 1 (Figure 1) illustrates the exchange of SupplementalData
   message during the TLS handshake as specified in RFC4680 [SuppData]
   and is repeated here for convenience.

2.2.  Overview of authorization extensions

   RFC5878 [AUTHZ] defines two authorization extension types that are
   used in the ClientHello and ServerHello messages and are repeated
   below for convenience.


         enum {
           client_authz(7), server_authz(8), (65535)
         } ExtensionType;

Internet-Draft             TLS Auth Using DTCP              October 2012


   A client uses the client_authz and server_authz extensions in the
   ClientHello message to indicate that it will send client
   authorization data and receive server authorization data respectively
   in the SupplementalData messages.  A server uses the extensions in a
   similar manner in its ServerHello message.  RFC5878 [AUTHZ] also
   establishes a registry that is maintained by IANA for registering
   authorization data formats.  This document defines a new
   authorization data type that is used in both the client_authz and
   server_authz extensions and allows the client and server to exchange
   DTCP certificates in the SupplementalData message.

2.3.  Overview of Supplemental Data usage for authorization

   Section 3 of RFC5878 [AUTHZ] specifies the syntax of the Supplemental
   Data message when carrying the authz_data message that is negotiated
   in the client_authz and/or server_authz types.  The syntax is
   repeated here for convenience.



          enum {
             authz_data(16386), (65535)
          } SupplementalDataType;

          struct {
             SupplementalDataType supplemental_data_type;
             select(SupplementalDataType) {
                case authz_data:  AuthorizationData;
             }
          } SupplementalData;



   This document defines a new authorization data format that is used in
   the authz_data message when sending DTCP Authorization data.


3.  DTCP Authorization Data Format

3.1.  DTCP Authorization Type

   The DTCP Authorization type definition in the TLS Authorization Data
   Formats registry is:



          dtcp_authorization(TBA);

3.2.  DTCP Authorization Data

   The DTCP Authorization data SHALL be sent in the authz_data message
   when the authorization data type is dtcp_authorization.  The syntax
   of the authorization data is:



         struct {
             opaque random_bytes[32];
         } RandomNonce;

         struct {
             opaque ASN.1 Cert<1..2^24-1>;
             opaque DTCP Cert<1..2^24-1>;
         } DigitallySigned;

         struct {
             RandomNonce nonce;
             DigitallySigned certs;
         } dtcp_authz_data;



   The ASN.1 Certificate in the structure above MUST be the same as the
   sender's certificate that will be sent in the Certificate or
   ClientCertificate message.

   RandomNonce - consists of 32 bytes generated by a secure random
   number generator.  The dtcp_authz_data message MUST always contain a
   RandomNonce.

   DigitallySigned - contains the tuple {ASN.1 Certificate, DTCP
   Certificate} followed by the digital signature generated using the
   private key associated with the DTCP certificate using an Elleptic
   Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EC-DSA) as specified in [DTCP].
   The sender SHALL include this in the dtcp_authz_data message only
   when it is sending its own DTCP Certificate.

3.3.  Usage rules for clients to exchange DTCP Authorization data

   A client MUST include both the client_authz and server_authz
   extensions in the extended client hello message when indicating its
   desire to exchange DTCP authorization data with the server.
   Additionally the client MUST use the authorization data type
   specified in Section 3.1 in the extension_data field to specify the
   format of the authorization data.  A client will receive the server's
   dtcp_authz_data before it sends its own dtcp_authz_data.  When

Internet-Draft             TLS Auth Using DTCP              October 2012


   sending its own dtcp_authz_data message, the client MUST use the same
   RandomNonce that it received in the server's dtcp_authz_data message.

3.4.  Usage rules for servers to exchange DTCP Authorization data

   A server MUST respond with both the client_authz and server_authz
   extensions in the extended server hello message when indicating its
   desire to exchange dtcp_authorization data with the client.
   Additionally the server MUST use the authorization data type
   specified in Section 3.1 in the extension_data field to specify the
   format of the dtcp_authorization data.  A server MUST generate and
   populate the RandomNonce in the dtcp_authz_data message.  If the
   client's hello message does not contain both the client_authz and
   server_authz extensions with dtcp_authorization type, the server
   SHALL not include support for dtcp_authorization data in its hello
   message.

3.5.  Alert Messages

   This document reuses TLS Alert messages for any errors that arise
   during authorization processing, while preserving the AlertLevels as
   specified in [AUTHZ].  Additionally the following AlertDescription
   values SHALL be used to report errors in dlna_authorization
   processing:



           unsupported_extension:
             In dtcp_authorization processing a client uses this when
             it receives a server hello message that indicates support
             for only one of client_authz or server_authz extension.




4.  Acknowledgements

   This document derives its structure and much of its content from
   [SuppData], [AUTHZ] and [RFC6042].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires a new entry in the IANA-maintained TLS
   Authorization Data Formats registry, dtcp_authorization(TBA).  This
   registry is defined in [AUTHZ].
