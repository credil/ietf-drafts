Abstract

   This document examines the process of transporting applications via
   multicast across inter-domain peering points. The objective is to
   describe the setup process for multicast-based delivery across
   administrative domains and document supporting functionality to
   enable this process.

   1. Introduction

   Several types of applications (e.g., live video streaming) are well
   suited for delivery via multicast means. The use of multicast for
   delivering such applications offers significant savings for
   utilization of resources in any given administrative domain. End
   user demand for such applications is growing. Often, this requires
   transporting such applications across administrative domains via
   inter-domain peering points.

   The objective of this Best Current Practices document is twofold:
     o Describe the process and establish guidelines for setting up
        multicast-based delivery of applications across inter-domain
        peering points, and
     o Catalog  all  required  information  exchange  between  the
        administrative domains to support multicast-based delivery.

   While there are several multicast protocols available for use, this
   BCP will limit the discussion to the peering requirements of a
   select set of the newer and more popular protocols including:
     o Protocol  Independent  Multicast  -  Source  Specific  Multicast
        (PIM-SSM) [RFC4607]
     o Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) v3 [RFC4604]
     o Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [RFC4604]

   This document therefore serves the purpose of a "Gap Analysis"
   exercise for this process. The rectification of any gaps identified
   - whether they involve protocol extension development or otherwise -
   is beyond the scope of this document and is for further study.

   2. Overview of Inter-domain Multicast Application Transport

   A multicast-based application delivery scenario is as follows:
     o Two independent administrative domains are interconnected via a
        peering point.
     o The peering point is either multicast enabled (end-to-end
        native multicast across the two domains) or it is connected by
        one of two possible tunnel types:
       o A Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) Tunnel [RFC2784]
          allowing multicast tunneling across the peering point, or
       o An Automatic Multicast Tunnel (AMT) [IETF-ID-AMT].
     o The application originates at a source in Domain A
     o An End User associated with Domain B requests the application
     o The request is communicated to the application source which
        commences the delivery via multicast

     o Application is distributed via Multicast from the source in
        Domain A through the Peering Point interface and then to the
        End User through Domain B.

   The setup of the delivery process along with associated requirements
   is described in section 3. A comprehensive list of required
   information that needs to be exchanged between the two domains to
   support various functions enabling the application transport is
   provided in section 4.

   3. Inter-domain Peering Point Requirements for Multicast

   The transport of applications using multicast requires that the
   inter-domain peering point is enabled to support such a process.
   There are three possible Use Cases for consideration.

   3.1. Native Multicast

   This Use Case involves end-to-end Native Multicast between the two
   administrative domains and the peering point is also native
   multicast enabled.

   Interface requirements for this Use Case need to be described here.



   3.2. Peering Point Enabled with GRE Tunnel

   The peering point is not native multicast enabled in this Use Case.
   There is a Generic Routing Encapsulation Tunnel provisioned over the
   peering point.

   Interface requirements for this Use Case need to be described here.



   3.3. Peering Point Enabled with an AMT

   The peering point in this Use Case is provisioned with an Automatic
   Multicast Tunnel.

   Interface requirements for this Use Case need to be described here.

   4. Supporting Functionality

   Supporting functions and related interfaces over the peering point
   that enable the multicast transport of the application are listed in
   this section. Critical information parameters that need to be
   exchanged in support of these functions are enumerated along with
   guidelines as appropriate. Specific interface functions for
   consideration are as follows.

   4.1. Network Transport and Security Guidelines





   4.2. Routing Aspects and Related Guidelines





   4.3. Back Office Functions - Billing and Logging Guidelines





   4.4. Operations - Service Performance and Monitoring Guidelines





   4.5. Reliability Models/Service Assurance Guidelines





   4.6. Provisioning Guidelines
