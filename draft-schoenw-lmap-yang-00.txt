Internet-Draft               LMAP Data Model               February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document sketches a data model for configuring and scheduling
   tests for large scale broadband access network measurements.  The
   data model is defined using the YANG [RFC6020] data modeling
   language.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Data Model Overview

   The data model has the following structure, where square brackets are
   used to enclose a list's keys, "?" means that the leaf is optional,
   and "*" denotes a leaf-list:


   module: acme-lmap
      +--rw lmap
         +--rw tests
         |  +--rw test [name]
         |     +--rw name           string
         |     +--rw description?   string
         |     +--rw program        string
         |     +--rw option [name]
         |     |  +--rw name     string
         |     |  +--rw value?   string
         |     +--rw argument*      string
         +--rw schedules
            +--rw schedule [name]
               +--rw name            string
               +--rw test?           leafref
               +--rw enabled?        boolean
               +--rw (schedule-type)?
               |  +--:(periodic)
               |  |  +--rw interval?       uint32
               |  +--:(calendar)
               |  |  +--rw weekday?        weekday-set
               |  |  +--rw month-set?      months-set
               |  |  +--rw day*            int8
               |  |  +--rw hour*           int8
               |  |  +--rw minute*         int8
               |  +--:(one-shot)
               +--ro failures?       yang:counter32
               +--ro last-failure?   string
               +--ro last-failed?    yang:date-and-time

3.  YANG Module

   The data model uses types imported from [RFC6021].

                the specified number of seconds have passed.

                The scheduler must ignore all periodic schedules that
                have a interval value of 0. A periodic schedule
                with a scheduling interval of 0 seconds will therefore
                never invoke a test.

                Implementations may be forced to delay invocations in
                the face of local constraints. A scheduled test should
