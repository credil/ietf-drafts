           PIM MTU Hello Option for PIM Message Encapsulation
                       draft-lts-pim-hello-mtu-01

Abstract

   This memo introduces a new PIM Hello MTU Option which is carried in
   PIM Hello messages.  The MTU option enables interface MTU information
   to be exchanged among PIM neighbors, and PIM messages to be
   encapsulated in an efficient and consistent way.

Internet-Draft            PIM Hello MTU Option                 July 2012


1.  Introduction

   A PIM router often needs to preserve a great many (*,G) or (S,G)
   multicast forwarding states to enable traffic forwarding for large
   scale of multicast channels.  These states are usually set up and
   kept alive by each downstream router periodically sending Join
   Messages carrying its own forwarding states to its upstream neighbor.
   For each round of assembling these states into a PIM message,
   multiple segments of packets might be generated due to the MTU
   limitation on the sending PIM interface.

   Current implementation uses merely sending link MTU to calculate
   maximum PIM packet length without considering the receiving MTU of
   the neighbor(s).  It has some drawbacks because if the MTU of the
   sending interface is larger than that of the receiving one, PIM
   protocol packets encapsulated according to the sending MTU will most
   possibly be discarded by the receiving router and the forwarding
   states cannot be properly established as a result.  There are already
   faults being reported caused by inconsistent MTU configuration among
   PIM neighbors.

   Even though the problem could be resolved by requiring each PIM
   downstream interface to take less or equal MTU value than its
   upstream interface, it is inflexible for operation and does not scale
   because the interface or link conditions across the network might be
   diverse in practice.  As a remedy, this memo recommends exchanging
   link MTU information among PIM neighbors by using a new Hello MTU
   Option.  The option is carried in periodical PIM Hello messages for a
   router to inform its receiving link MTU parameter on an interface to
   the connected neighbor(s), so that the MTU information could be
   referenced by the neighbor(s) when they are sending PIM protocol
   messages on this link.

   PIM MTU Option can be applied to all variants of PIM protocols, i.e.,
   PIM-SM, PIM-SSM, PIM-DM, and BIDIR-PIM, on both IPv4 and IPv6
   networks.  There is an exception for the processing of PIM-SM
   Register/Register-Stop Message, which should reference the MTU
   information on the entire path between source DR and RP, as described
   in 4.4.1 of [RFC4601].

   It should be noted that PIM MTU Option extension is different from
   multicast PMTU discovery mentioned in [RFC1981] .  Section 5.2 of
   RFC1981 describes that an implementation could maintain a single PMTU
   learned across the whole multicast distribution tree.  This might
   result in using smaller packets than necessary for a lot of paths.
   And because the end to end paths can be very dynamic it could make
   the effort too complex.  This PMTU is used in encapsulating a
   'multicast data packet' to avoid fragmentation in multicast data

   plane as the packet travels on all paths of the tree.  Whereas PIM
   MTU option works in control plane and has a per-hop nature - it only
   functions between adjacent one-hop PIM neighbors to guide the sending
   of a 'PIM protocol message'.

   The maintenance of MTU in control plane (by PIM Hello MTU Option) and
   data plane (by PMTU) are for different purposes and are run
   independently - the control plane makes sure that forwarding paths
   are setup even there exists asymmetric MTUs on different links, while
   the data plane is to make multicast delivery efficient by avoiding
   fragmenting/reassembling operation, which could be done by means of
   acquiring minimal MTU on all paths, and of applying it in generating
   a data packet on first-hop or head-end.  Control plane cannot
   preclude fragmentation, but it is the premise of normal data
   forwarding - even if some data packets exceeding limitation of some
   points of the paths cannot be processed properly, other packets
   meeting the PMTU requirements will be normally forwarded and
   delivered.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  MTU Option and its Operation Rule

   To record the minimum usable sending MTU value on an interface, a new
   General Purpose non-group-specific state - Sending MTU state is
   introduced in PIM protocols (for General Purpose State referring to
   4.1.1 of [RFC4601] and [RFC3973], and 3.1.1 of [RFC5015]).  It is 32-
   bit long and is unique on an interface whether the link connected is
   point-to-point or multi-accessed.  The initial value of the Sending
   MTU state should be set to the outbound MTU of the interface, taking
   either the configured MTU or the default MTU value (referring to 7.1
   of [RFC1191] for common MTU for different link types).

   When an MTU Hello Option is received from a neighbor, a PIM router
   parses the MTU value in the option and decides whether or not it
   should accept the value and store it in the Sending MTU field.  A
   router should not accept too small a value to prevent extreme
   fragmentation from deteriorating the router's performance.  If the
   MTU value is valid from a legal neighbor, it compares the value with
   the MTU value currently stored in the Sending MTU field, and makes
   the replacement if the former is less than the latter.

Internet-Draft            PIM Hello MTU Option                 July 2012


   Unlike other PIM Hello option, MTU Option is not required being
   supported simultaneously by all PIM neighbors connecting to a
   network.  An MTU-capable router only considers the MTU of a trusty
   neighbor from which a valid MTU option is received.  An MTU-capable
   PIM router should use MTU option in its Hello message, and should
   keep the Sending MTU state to the initial value if no neighbor
   reports a valid MTU Option.  Finally, an MTU-incapable router should
   ignore an MTU option on reception.

   The Sending MTU state should be checked before sending a multicast
   PIM message, to ensure the length of the message does not exceed the
   MTU limit of both the sending and receiving links.  It should be
   noted that as a convention, the length calculation starts from the
   beginning of an IP header.


4.  Option Format

   A Hello MTU Option has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |         Type = TBD            |          Length = 4           |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |           Value = inbound MTU of this interface               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type: to be assigned by IANA if this option is accepted.  The field
   is 16-bit long.

   Length: the length of the Value field.  The field is 16-bit long.

   Value: inbound MTU value for this interface.  The field is 32-bit
   long.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The Type field should be allocated by IANA if MTU option is accepted.


6.  Security Considerations

   The potential security threat for MTU option should be the denial-
   of-service attack of extremely fragmenting PIM messages, by
   advertising much smaller MTU value than necessary.  A remedy is to
   require a PIM router to check the validity of a neighbor's MTU value
