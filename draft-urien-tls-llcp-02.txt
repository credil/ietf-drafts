Abstract 
    
   This document describes the implementation, named LLCPS, of the TLS 
   protocol over the NFC (Near Field Communication) LLCP (Logical Link 
   Control Protocol) layer. The NFC peer to peer (P2P) protocol may be 
   used by any application that needs communication between two devices 
   at very small distances (a few centimeters). LLCPS enforces a strong 
   security in NFC P2P exchanges, and may be deployed for many 
   services, in the Internet Of Things (IoT) ecosystem, such as 
   payments, access control or ticketing operations. Applications 
   secured by LLCPS are identified by the service name 
   "urn:nfc:sn:tls:x" where x is the application name.

1 Overview 
    
1.1 About the NFC protocol 
    
   The Near Field Communication protocol (NFC) is based on standards 
   such as [ECMA340] or [ISO/IEC 18092]. It uses the 13,56 Mhz 
   frequency, with data rates ranging from 106 To 848 kbps. The working 
   distance between two nodes is about a few centimeters, with 
   electromagnetic fields ranging between 1 and 10 A/M. 
    
   There are two classes of working operations: 
    
   - Reader/Writer and Card Emulation. A device named "Reader" feeds 
   another device called "Card", thanks to a 13,56 MHz electromagnetic 
   field coupling. This mode is typically used with [ISO7816] 
   contactless smartcards or with NFC RFIDs. 
    
   - Peer To Peer (P2P). Two devices, the "Initiator" and the "Target" 
   establish a NFC communication link. In the "Active" mode these two 
   nodes are managing their own energy resources. In the "Passive" mode 
   the Initiator powers the Target via a 13,56 MHz electromagnetic 
   field coupling. 
    
   This draft focuses on P2P security, which is required by many 
   applications, targeting access control, transport, or other Internet 
   Of Things (IoT) items. Although the NFC protocol enables data 
   exchange at small physical distances, it doesn't support 
   standardized security features providing privacy or integrity. Thus, 
   protocols such as [SNEP] or [NPP], whose goal is to push NDEF [NDEF] 
   contents, are not today secured. In this draft we define a profile 
   for TLS support in P2P operations. 
    
   A P2P session (see figure 1) occurs in four logical phases: 
    
   1) Initialization and Anti-collision. The Initiator periodically 
   sends a request packet (and therefore generates a RF field), which 
   is acknowledged by a Target response packet. Because several Targets 
   may be located near the Initiator, an anti-collision mechanism is 
   managed by the Initiator in order to establish a session with a 
   single Target. 
   2) Protocol Activation and Parameters Selection. The Initiator 
   starts a logical session with a detected Target by sending a ATR-REQ 
   (Attribute-Request) message, which is confirmed by a Target ATR-RESP 
   (Attribute-Response) message. These messages fix the device IDs 
   (DIDi, Device ID Initiator and DIDt, Device ID Target) used in 
   further packet exchanges. Optional information fields (Gi for the 
   Initiator, and Gt for the Target) identify the protocol to be used 
   over the MAC level; in this document it is assumed that the LLCP 
   [LLCP] (Logical Link Control Protocol) protocol is selected by the 
   Gi and Gt bytes. Optionally some parameters are negotiated by 
   additional packets.

                                     LLCPS                   July 2013 
 
   3) Data Exchange. Frames are exchanged via the DEP (Data Exchange 
   Protocol) protocol. DEP works with DEP-REQ (DEP-Request) transmitted 
   by the Initiator and DEP-RESP (DEP-Response) delivered by the 
   Target. DEP provides error detection and recovery. It uses small 
   data unit size (from 64 to 256 bytes); however it supports a 
   chaining mode for larger sizes. DEP frames typically transport LLCP 
   packets, and provide an error free service 
   4) De-Activation. The Initiator may deactivate the Target by sending 
   a RLS-REQ (Release Request) message acknowledged by a RLS-RESP 
   (Release Response). 
    
   Usually, and for practical reasons, P2P sessions are established 
   between a unique Target and an Initiator, for example a mobile phone 
   and another NFC device. They are automatically started when the 
   distance between the two NFC modes is sufficiently small. The MAC 
   link may be broken at any time, as soon as the distance disables 
   radio operations.

                           Figure 1. A NFC P2P Session 
    
   Due to the dissymmetry of the DEP protocol (see figure 2), in which 
   the Initiator sends requests and Target returns responses, the NFC-
   P2P MAC services are dissymmetric on the Initiator and Target sides. 
    
   - The Initiator delivers Data.Request-i and gets Data.Indication-i. 
   - The Target gets Data.Indication-t and delivers Data.Request-t 
    
   MAC services implemented by NFC controllers usually support such 
   dissymmetric primitives for Initiator and Target procedures (MAC 
   Data.request-i/t and Data.Indication-i/t). 
    
   The timeout value (between DEP-REQ and DEP-RESP messages) is deduced 
   from the RWT attribute (Response Waiting Time) returned by the 
   Target in the ATR-RESP message. RWT ranges between 0,6 ms and 9,9 
   ms. It may be extended to the RWT-INT by a factor RTOX (RWT-INT = 
   RTOX x RWT) between 1 and 60, so the maximum value is about 6s.

1.2 The LLCP layer 
    
   The LLCP [LLCP] protocol works like a light LLC [IEEE 802.2] layer. 
   It provides two classes of services, connectionless transport and 
   connection-oriented transport. 
    
   This draft focuses both on connection-oriented transport, in which 
   TLS services are identified by a Service Name (SN), and on non-
   connected mode, in which a fix (well-known) Service Access Point 
   (SAP) is used. 
    
   A LLCP packet (see figure 3) comprises three mandatory fields, DSAP 
   (Destination Service Access Point, 6 bits), SSAP (Source Service 
   Access Point, 6 bits), and PTYPE (Protocol data unit type field, 4 
   bits). 
    
   An optional sequence field (8 bits) contains two 4 bits number N(S) 
   and N(R) respectively giving the number of the information SDU to be 
   sent and the number of the next information PDU to be received. 
    
   An optional Information field transports the LLCP payload. 
    
         <--------------LLCP Header--------------><-LLCP Payload -> 
         |  DSAP  | PTYPE  |  SSAP  |  Sequence   |  INFORMATION  | 
         | 6 bits | 4 bits | 6 bits | 0 or 8 bits |   M x 8 bits  | 
    
                      Figure 3. Structure of an LLCP packet 
    
   There are sixteen types of LLCP packets, identified by PTYPE values 
   ranging between 0 and 15. In this draft we use only nine of these 
   PDUs. 
    
   1) Symmetry (SYMM, PTYPE=0, DSAP=SSAP=0, No Sequence, No 
   Information). This PDU is produced as soon as there is no 
   information to provide. This mechanism avoids timeout at the MAC 
   (DEP) level. SYMM SHOULD be generated after an inactivity period of 
   about LTO/2, where LTO is the link timeout.

   2) Connect (CONNECT, PTYPE=4, No sequence, Information). This PDU 
   MUST include a SN (service name parameter) that identified the TLS 
   service ("com.ietf.tls"). It uses a DSAP value set to 1 (the SAP of 
   the Service Discovery Protocol, SDP) and a SSAP value ranging 
   between 16 and 31. It indicates the connection the well-known 
   service (WKS) SDP (SAP=1), which SHOULD deliver an ephemeral SAP 
   (SAP-client) ranging between 16 and 31. 
    
   3) Connection Complete (CC, PTYPE=6, No sequence, Optional 
   Information). This PDU notifies the successful connection to the 
   "com.ietf.tls" service. It allocates the SAP (DSAP=SAP-client) to be 
   used for this session identified by the tuple (SAP-server, SAP-
   client) 
    
   4) Disconnection (DISC, PTYPE=5, No sequence, No Information). This 
   PDU indicates the disconnection of the (SAP-server, SAP-client) 
   session. Null SAP values MAY be used to notify the disconnection of 
   the LLCP entity. 
    
   5) Disconnected Mode (DM, TYPE=7, No sequence, one byte of 
   Information). This PDU confirms the disconnection of the (SAP-
   server, SAP-client) session; one information byte gives the 
   "Disconnected Mode Reasons". Null SAP values notify the 
   disconnection of the LLCP entity. 
    
   6) Information (INFORMATION, PTYPE=10, Sequence, information). This 
   PDU transport a SDU; N(S) indicates the SDU number, N(R) indicates 
   the next SDU number to be received. In this draft the Receive 
   Windows Size (RW) MUST be set to one, which is the default LLCP 
   value. 
    
   7) Receive Ready (RR, PTYPE=11, sequence N(R) only, no Information). 
   This PDU is used for the acknowledgment of previously received 
   information PDU. It indicates the next sequence number (N(R)) to be 
   received. 
    
   8) Receive Not Ready (RNR, PTYPE=12, sequence N(R) only, no 
   Information).This PDU indicates a temporary inability to process 
   subsequent information PDUs. 
    
   9) Unnumbered Information (UI, PTYPE=3, no Sequence, Optional 
   Information). This PDU is used to transfer service data units to the peer 
   LLC without prior establishment of a data link connection. 
    
   According to [LLCP] some LLCP functional parameters are updated by 
   LLCP-Parameter attributes exchanged in LLCP packets or in ATR-REQ 
   and ATR-RESP messages. Parameters are encoding according to TLV 
   format, in which Type size is one byte, Length size is one byte and 
   Value is a set of L bytes. In this document we use 6 parameters.

   1) Version Number (VERSION, T=01h, L=01h, V=10h). In this document 
   this option MUST be included in the general bytes of ATR-REQ and 
   ATR-RESP.

   128. The MIUX parameter MAY be inserted in general bytes of ATR-REQ 
   and ATR-RESP, and in LLCP PDUs CONNECT and CC. 
    
   3) Well-Known Service List (WKS, T=03h, L=02h). This parameter 
   associates a bit to the instance of a well-known LLCP parameter. A 
   typical value is 00001h, indicating the availability of the DSP 
   service. WKS MAY be inserted in general bytes of ATR-REQ and ATR-
   RESP. 
    
   4) Link Timeout (LTO, T=04h, L=01h). This parameter indicates the 
   timeout value for the LLCP layer, in multiples of 10ms. LTO MAY be 
   inserted in general bytes of ATR-REQ and ATR-RESP. 
    
   5) Receive Windows Frame (RW, T=05h, L=01h). This parameter 
   indicates the size of the receive windows, its value ranges between 
   0 and 15. The default value is one, and MUST be set to one according 
   to this document. It MAY be inserted in LLCP PDUs CONNECT or CC. 
    
   6) Service Name (SN, T=06h). This parameter indicates the name of a 
   service. It MUST be inserted in the CONNECT PDU. In this document 
   its value is set to "urn:nfc:sn:tls:x", where x is the application 
   name securely transported by TLS. 
    
1.3 LLCPS basic guidelines 
    
   The TLS protocol is a series of record messages, which MAY be 
   encrypted or integrity-protected. Each record message includes a 
   five bytes prefix that comprises three attributes: 
   - The type (one byte) of the message, 
   - The version (two bytes), 
   - The message length (two bytes). 
    
   The client and the server exchange RECORD messages whose meaning is 
   deduced from the TLS protocol rules, according to a half-duplex 
   paradigm. Therefore as soon as the beginning of the TLS session is 
   detected, the two TLS entities alternatively send and receive a set 
   of record messages, whose synchronization is handled by the 
   knowledge of TLS protocol. 
    
   The EAP-TLS protocol [RFC 5216] shows how TLS record messages may be 
   gathered in blocks exchanged according to a half-duplex mechanism. 
    
   LLCPS specifies the TLS session establishment and release, and the 
   transport of TLS packets in a NFC P2P context.

   Applications secured by LLCPS are identified by the service name 
   "urn:nfc:sn:tls:x" where x is the application name. 
    
2 TLS support over LLCP, Connection-oriented Transport 
    
   In NFC P2P mode the Initiator detects a Target and afterwards starts 
   and manages a data exchange session; it may optionally feed the 
   Target device. The Initiator has consequently a longer useful life 
   than the Target; it is a legitimate place to host TLS server in a 
   permanent way. 
    
   However the TLS server MAY be hosted on the Initiator or on the 
   Target side. 
    
   Each entity manages five exclusive processes 
    
   - The Connection Process (CP) 
   - The Disconnection Process (DP) 
   - The Sending Process (SP) 
   - The Receiving Process (RP) 
   - The Inactivity Process (IP) 
    
   The Inactivity Process MAY be started (see figure 4) each time a 
   receiving or sending buffer is empty; in this case it is assumed 
   that the computing time or the delay required before the next 
   input/output operation is greater than the LLCP timeout (LTO). 
    
2.1 Peer To Peer Link Establishment 
    
   As described in section 1, the Initiator periodically probes the 
   presence of a Target. At the end of the "Protocol Activation and 
   Parameters Selection" phase, ATR-REQ and ATR-RESP messages have been 
   exchanged, and LLCP services are available on both Initiator and 
   Target nodes, including in particular the Data-Request-i/t and Data-
   Indication-i/t primitives. 
    
   Due to the ephemeral intrinsic nature of an NFC connection, the P2P 
   session may be broken at any time, which implies transmission or 
   reception errors notified by the MAC primitives. 
    
   As a consequence an LLCP session is assumed to be released at the 
   first MAC error. 
    
   Once a NFC P2P link is established, TLS server and client software 
   entities are activated. Procedures such as: 
    
   - SOCKET acceptllcp (char  *ServiceName), and 
   - SOCKET connectllcp(char  *ServiceName)

   MAY be used respectively on Initiator and Target sides, in order to 
   get a SOCKET. 
    
    
   A SOCKET object supports additional facilities, typically the 
   following procedures: 
    
   - int sendllcp(SOCKET s, char *buffer, int length) 
   - int recvllcp(SOCKET s, char *buffer, int length) 
   - int closellcp(SOCKET s) 
    
   which are used for the LLCP session management.

   2.2 Inactivity Process 
    
   When the LLCP layer detects an inactivity period greater than a 
   given timeout value (see figure 5), it generates a SYMM PDU. 
   Therefore each time a LLCP layer is waiting for a non SYMM PDU, and 
   receives a SYMM PDU, it MUST acknowledge it by sending a SYMM PDU. A 
   maximum number (SYMM-Ct-i/t) of echoed SYMM PDU SHOULD be defined. 
    
   The Inactivity Process (IP) MAY start between the Receiving Process 
   (RP) and the Sending Process (SP). 
    
   Upon the reception of an INFORMATION PDU, the packet is stored in 
   the reception buffer, and is acknowledged by a RR PDU.

  2.5.2 Disconnection initiated by the Target 
    
   The Target receives a LLCP PDU. If it receives DISC then it sends 
   DM; else it sends the DISC PDU.

   Each packet MUST be acknowledged by the Target with a RR PDU. 
    
   If a RNR PDU is received instead of a RR PDU then the initiator 
   sends a SYMM PDU that should be acknowledged either by a SYMM (if 
   the target is still overloaded) or by a RR PDU (if the target is 
   ready again to process INFORMATION PDUs).

   The Target switches to the sending process, managed by the 
   sendllcp() procedure. 
    
   The Target MUST receive a SYMM PDU. 
    
   The buffer to be sent is segmented in INFORMATION PDUs. 
    
   Each INFORMATION PDU is sent by the Target to the Initiator and MUST 
   be acknowledged by a RR PDU. 
    
   If a RNR PDU is received instead of a RR PDU then the target sends a 
   SYMM PDU that should be acknowledged either by a SYMM (if the 
   initiator is still overloaded) or by a RR PDU (if the initiator is 
   ready again to process INFORMATION PDUs). 
    
    
   Upon the reception of the last RR PDU a SYMM PDU MUST be sent by the 
   Target to the Initiator.

2.7 Receiving Process 
    
   The Receiving process is handled by the recvllcp(SOCKET s, char 
   *buffer, int length) procedure, which manages a reception buffer. 
    
   2.7.1 Initiator side 
    
   A1) If the reception buffer is empty, the Initiator sends a SYMM 
   PDU. This PDU starts the Target receiving process. The expected PDU 
   received from the Target is either an INFORMATION PDU or a SYMM PDU 
   (notifying an ephemeral inactivity state). 
    
   B1) If the reception buffer stores enough data, then the size 
   requested by the recvllcp() procedure is returned. If the buffer 
   gets empty after this operation, a RR PDU is sent to the Target. The 
   PDU received from the Target is either an INFORMATION PDU or a SYMM 
   PDU. 
    
   B2) Else, while there is not enough data in the buffer, the 
   following loop is performed 
   - Send RR PDU 
   - Receive INFORMATION PDU 
    
   B2.1) at this end of this loop the size requested by the recvllcp() 
   procedure is returned. If the buffer gets empty after this

3 TLS support over LLCP, Connectionless Transport 
    
   In NFC P2P mode the Initiator detects a Target and afterwards starts 
   and manages a data exchange session; it may optionally feed the 
   Target device. 
    
   The Initiator has consequently a longer useful life than the Target; 
   it is a legitimate place to host TLS server in a permanent way. 
    
   However the TLS server MAY be hosted on the Initiator or on the 
   Target side. 
    
   Each entity manages five exclusive processes 
    
   - The Connection Process (CP) 
   - The Disconnection Process (DP) 
   - The Sending Process (SP) 
   - The Receiving Process (RP) 
   - The Inactivity Process (IP) 
    
   The Inactivity Process MAY be started (see figure 14) each time a 
   receiving or sending buffer is empty; in this case it is assumed 
   that the computing time or the delay required before the next 
   input/output operation is greater than the LLCP timeout (LTO).

3.1 Peer To Peer Link Establishment 
    
   As described in section 1, the Initiator periodically probes the 
   presence of a Target. At the end of the "Protocol Activation and 
   Parameters Selection" phase, ATR-REQ and ATR-RESP messages have been 
   exchanged, and LLCP services are available on both Initiator and 
   Target nodes, including in particular the Data-Request-i/t and Data-
   Indication-i/t primitives. 
    
   Due to the ephemeral intrinsic nature of an NFC connection, the P2P 
   session may be broken at any time, which implies transmission or 
   reception errors notified by the MAC primitives. 
    
   As a consequence an LLCP session is assumed to be released at the 
   first MAC error. 
    
   Once a NFC P2P link is established, TLS server and client software 
   entities are activated. Procedures such as: 
    
   - SOCKET acceptllcp(char TLS-SAP), and 
   - SOCKET connectllcp(char TLS-SAP) 
    
   MAY be used respectively on Initiator and Target sides, in order to 
   get a SOCKET. This object supports additional facilities, typically 
   the following procedures: 
    
   - int sendllcp(SOCKET s, char *buffer, int length) 
   - int recvllcp(SOCKET s, char *buffer, int length) 
   - int closellcp(SOCKET s) 
    
   which are used for the LLCP session management.

3.2 Inactivity Process 
    
   When the LLCP layer detects an inactivity period greater that a 
   given timeout value (see figure 15), it generates a SYMM PDU. 
   Therefore each time a LLCP layer is waiting for a non SYMM PDU, and 
   receives a SYMM PDU, it MUST acknowledge it by sending a SYMM PDU. A 
   maximum number (SYMM-Ct-i/t) of echoed SYMM PDU SHOULD be defined. 
    
   Upon the reception of an UI PDU, the packet is stored in the 
   reception buffer. 
    
   The Inactivity Process (IP) MAY start between the Receiving Process 
   (RP) and the Sending Process (SP).

   graceful closing of a TLS session. The Disconnection Process is 
   initiated by the Initiator or the Target. 
    
  3.5.1 Disconnection initiated by the Initiator 
    
   The Initiator MUST send a DM PDU 
    
   The Target receives the DM PDU. 
    
   The Target sends a SYMM or a DM PDU. 
    
  3.5.2 Disconnection initiated by the Target 
    
   If the Target receives a DM PDU, then it sends the DM or the SYMM 
   PDU. 
    
   Else the Target sends the DM PDU.

3.7 Receiving Process 
    
   The Receiving process is handled by the  
                     recvllcp(SOCKET s, char *buffer, int length)  
   procedure, which manages a reception buffer. 
    
   3.7.1 Initiator side 
    
   A1) If the reception buffer is empty, the Initiator sends a SYMM 
   PDU. This PDU starts the Target receiving process. The expected PDU 
   received from the Target is either an UI PDU or a SYMM PDU 
   (notifying an ephemeral inactivity state). 
    
   B1) If the reception buffer stores enough data, then the size 
   requested by the recvllcp() procedure is returned. If the buffer 
   gets empty after this operation, the SYMM PDU SHOULD be sent to the 
   Target. The PDU received from the Target is either an UI PDU or a 
   SYMM PDU. 
    
   B2) Else, while there is not enough data in the buffer, the 
   following loop is performed 
   - Send SYMM 
   - Receive UI PDU 
    
   B2.1) at this end of this loop the size requested by the recvllcp() 
   procedure is returned. If the buffer gets empty after this 
   operation, the SYMM PDU SHOULD be sent to the Target. The PDU 
   received from the Target is either an UI PDU or a SYMM PDU. 
    
   In B1 and B2.1 a SYMM PDU SHOULD be sent when the reception buffer 
   gets empty. This rule avoids un-needed transition to the IP process. 
   It is a "double checking" of the empty buffer event.
