JSON Format Extensions for Traffic Engineering (TE) performance metrics

                        draft-wu-alto-json-te-00

Abstract

   The base ALTO specification defines two properties for cost metric
   attribute in the Cost MAP, including 'hopcount' and 'routingcost'.
   This specification adds five new properties and one new parameter for
   Traffic Engineering(TE) performance related constraint attribute
   associated with cost metric attribute 'routingcost' in the ALTO
   Information Resource Directory: Link Delay, Delay Variation, Packet
   Loss, Residual Bandwidth, Available Bandwidth,linkstate.

1.  Introduction

   The ALTO protocol [I.D-ietf-alto-protocol] uses a REST-ful design
   [Fielding-Thesis], and encodes its requests and responses using JSON.
   In ALTO architecture [I.D-ietf-alto-protocol], the ALTO server allows
   alto information to be gathered from multiple systems(e.g., routing
   protocol).  [I.D-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions] describes extensions
   to OSPF TE called "OSPF TE Metric Extensions", that can be used to
   distribute network performance information (such as link delay, delay
   variation, packet loss, residual bandwidth, and available bandwidth).
   The mechanism defined in [I.D-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions]can be
   used by an ALTO Server to retrieve the necessary performance
   information supplementing the prefix and network topology data
   gathered from other sources in the underlying network.

   In the ALTO Information Resource Directory, Network and Cost Map are
   two core ALTO Information provided to clients.  The TE performance
   metric can be represented using Cost MAP.  The base ALTO
   specification [I.D-ietf- alto-protocol] defines one typical cost
   metric attribute for Cost Type in the Cost MAP
   (i.e.,'routingcost')and uses constraint attribute to list additional
   constraints to which elements of the Cost Map are related.  This
   specification adds five new properties and one new parameter for
   constraint attribute associated with 'routingcost' cost metric
   attribute in alto information service: Link Delay, Link Jitter,
   Packet Loss, Residual Bandwidth, Available Bandwidth,linkstate.

   Namespace:

   Parameter name:  linkstate

   Purpose:  Used in a multi-valued property to
             indicate whether it is steady state
             link performance.

   Description:  When a property is multi-valued,
   LINKSTATE can be used to construct a steady state
   performancetopology for initial tunnel path computation,
   or to verify alternative failover paths. The LINSTATE
   is set when the measured value of this parameter exceeds
   its configured maximum threshold.  The LINKSTATE is
   cleared when the measured value falls below its
   configured threshold.LINKSTATE should be used
   together with properties we defined in the
   section 3.

       LINKSTATE-param =  "LINKSTATE=" INDEX-value

       LINKSTATE-value =  integer
