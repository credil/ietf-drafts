Abstract

   Edge RBridges currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and
   their egress RBridges by observing the data packets traversed
   through. When an ingress RBridge receives a data frame with its
   destination address (MAC&VLAN) unknown, the data frame is flooded
   within the VLAN across the TRILL campus. When there are more than
   one RBridge ports connected to one bridged LAN, only one of them can
   be designated as the Appointed Forwarder port for
   forwarding/receiving native traffic to/from each VLAN, the other
   RBridge ports on that LAN have to be disabled for native traffic in
   that VLAN.

   This draft describes the framework for using directory services to

Internet-Draft       TRILL Directory Assistance Framework      Oct 2012

1. Introduction

   Edge RBridges (devices implementing [RFC6325], also known as TRILL
   Switches) currently learn the mapping between destination MAC
   addresses and their egress RBridges by observing data packets. When
   ingress RBridge receives a data frame with its destination address
   (MAC&VLAN) unknown, the data frame is flooded within that VLAN
   across the TRILL campus. When there are more than one RBridge ports
   connected to one bridged LAN, only one of them can be designated as
   the Appointed Forwarder port for forwarding/receiving native traffic
   to/from for each VLAN. The other RBridge ports on that LAN have to
   be blocked for native traffic in that VLAN. (This ''blocked'' state
   has no effect of TRILL Data or IS-IS frames, which can still be sent
   and received. It only affects native frames.)

   This draft describes the framework for using directory services to
   assist edge RBridges by reducing multi-destination frames,
   particularly ARP, ND, and unknown unicast, improving TRILL network
   scalability in environments, such as data centers.

   Data center networks are different from enterprise campus networks
   in several ways, in particular:

   1. Data centers, especially Internet and/or multi-tenant data centers
     tend to have a large number of end stations with a wide variety of
     applications.
   2. Topology is usually based on racks and rows.
         -Guest OSs assignment to Servers, Racks, and Rows is
          orchestrated by a Server/VM Management system, not at random.
   3. Rapid workload shifting in data centers can accelerate the
     frequency of the physical servers being re-loaded with different
     applications. Sometimes, the applications loaded to one physical
     server at different times can belong to different subnets.
   4. With server virtualization, there is an ever-increasing trend to
     dynamically create or delete VMs when demand for resource changes,
     to move VMs from overloaded servers to less loaded servers, or to
     aggregate VMs onto fewer servers when demand is light.

   Both 3) and 4) above can lead to applications in one subnet being
   placed in different locations (racks or rows) or one rack having
   applications belonging to different subnets.

   This draft describes why and how Data Center TRILL networks can be
   optimized by utilizing a directory assisted approach.

   3.1. Issues of Flooding Based Learning in DCs

   It is common for Data Center networks to have multiple tiers of
   switches, for example, one or two Access Switches for each server
   rack (ToR), aggregation switches for some rows (or EoR switches),
   and some core switches to interconnect the aggregation switches.
   Many aggregation switches deployed in data centers have high port

   density. It is not uncommon to see aggregation switches
   interconnecting hundreds of ToR switches.

               Figure 1: Typical Data Center Network Design

   The following problems could occur when TRILL is deployed in a data
   center with large number of end stations, and the end stations in
   one subnet/VLAN could be placed under multiple edge RBridges:

      - Unnecessary filling of slots in MAC table of edge RBridges RB1,
        due to RB1 receiving broadcast/multicast traffic (e.g. ARP/ND,
        cluster multicast, etc.) from end stations under other edge
        RBridges that are not actually communicating with any end
        stations attached to RB1.
      - Some edge RBridge ports being blocked for user traffic when
        there are more than one RBridge ports connected to an edge
        bridged LAN. When there are multiple RBridge ports connected to
        a bridged LAN in each VLAN, only one (the Appointed Forwarder
        port) can forward/receive native traffic for that bridged LAN
        or VLAN. The rest have to be blocked for forwarding/receiving
        native traffic for that VLAN. When servers have dual uplinks to
        two different ToR switches (or edge RBridges), some links may
        not be fully utilized.
      - Packets being flooded across TRILL campus when their DAs are
        not in ingress RBridge's cache.
      - In an environment where VMs migrates, there is higher chance of
        cached entries becoming invalid, causing traffic to be black


Dunbar, et al                                                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       TRILL Directory Assistance Framework      Oct 2012

        holed by the egress RBridge. If VMs send out gratuitous ARP/ND
        or IEEE Std 802.1Qbg's VDP messages upon arriving at new
        locations, the ingress nodes might not have the MAC entries for
        the newly arrived VMs, causing more unknown flooding.

   3.2. Some Examples

   Consider a data center with 1600 server racks. Each server rack has
   at least one ToR switch. The ToR switches are further divided into 8
   groups, with each group being connected by a set of aggregation
   switches.  There could be 4 to 8 aggregation switches in each set to
   achieve load sharing for traffic to/from server racks. If TRILL is
   deployed in this data center environment, let's consider the
   following two scenarios for the TRILL campus boundary:

       - Scenario #1: TRILL campus boundary starts at ToR switches:

         If each server rack has one uplink to one ToR, there are 1600
         edge RBridges. If each rack has dual uplinks to two ToR
         switches, then there will be 3200 edge RBridges

         In this scenario, the TRILL domain will have more than 1600 (or
         3200) + 8*4 (or 8*8) nodes, which is a large IS-IS domain. Even
         though a mesh IS-IS domain can scale up to thousands of nodes,
         it is challenging for aggregation switches to handle IS-IS link
         state advertisement among hundreds of parallel ports.

       - Scenario #2: TRILL campus boundary starts at the aggregation
        switches:

         With the same assumption as before, the number of nodes in the
         TRILL campus will be less than 100, and aggregation switches
         don't have to handle IS-IS link state advisements among
         hundreds of parallel ports.

         But bridged LANs are formed under the aggregation switches in
         this scenario.  With aggregation switches being the RBridge
         edge nodes, multiple RBridge edge ports could be connected to
         one bridged LAN. To avoid potential loops, TRILL requires only
         one of multiple RBridge edge ports connected to each VLAN being
         designated as Appointed Forwarder [RFC6439], and other ports
         being blocked for native frames in that VLAN.

         There is also the possibility of loops on the bridged LAN
         attached to RBridge edge ports unless STP/RSTP is running.


Dunbar, et al                                                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       TRILL Directory Assistance Framework      Oct 2012

         Running traditional Layer 2 STP/RSTP on the bridged LAN in this
         environment may be overkill because the topology among the ToR
         switches and aggregation switches is very simple and may not
         allow loops.

         In addition, the number of MAC&VLAN<->Egress RBridge Mapping
         entries to be learned and managed by RBridge edge node can be
         very large. In the example above, each edge RBridge has 200
         edge ports facing the ToR switches. If each ToR has 40
         downstream ports facing servers and each server has 10 VMs,
         there could be 200*40*10 = 80000 end stations attached. If all
         those end stations belong to 1600 VLANs (i.e. 50 per VLAN) and
         each VLAN has 200 end stations, then under the worst-case
         scenario, the total number of MAC&VLAN entries to be learned by
         the edge RBridge can be 1600*200=320000, which is very large.

4. Benefits of Directory Assisted Edge RBridge in DC

   In data center environment, applications placement to servers,
   racks, and rows is orchestrated by Server (or VM) Management
   System(s). That is, there is a database or multiple databases
   (distributed model) that have the knowledge of where each
   application is placed. If the application location information can
   be fed to RBridge edge nodes, in some form of Directory Service,
   then RBridge edge nodes won't need to flood data frames with unknown
   DA across the TRILL campus.

   Avoiding unknown unicast DA flooding to TRILL campus is especially
   valuable in data center environment because there is higher chance
   of an edge RBridge receiving packets with unknown unicast DA and
   broadcast/multicast messages due to VM migration and servers being
   loaded with different applications.  When a VM is moved to a new
   location or a server is loaded with a new application with different
   IP/MAC addresses, it is more likely that the DA of data packets sent
   out from those VMs are unknown to their attached edge RBridges.  In
   addition, gratuitous ARP (IPv4) or Unsolicited Neighbor
   Advertisement (IPv6) sent out from those newly migrated or activated
   VMs have to be flooded to other edge RBridges that have VMs in the
   same subnets.

   The benefits of using directory assistance include:

      - Avoid flooding unknown unicast DA across TRILL campus. The
        Directory enforced MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge mapping table
        can determine if a data packet needs to be forwarded across
        TRILL campus.



Dunbar, et al                                                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       TRILL Directory Assistance Framework      Oct 2012

         When multiple RBridge edge ports are connected via a bridged
         LAN to end stations (servers/VMs), a directory assisted edge
         RBridge won't need to flood unknown unicast DA data frames to
         all ports of the edge RBridges in the frame's VLAN when it
         ingresses a frame. It can trust the directory to tell it where
         the DA is or it will discard the frame if the directory says
         the DA does not exist in the campus.

      - Reduce flooding of decapsulated Ethernet frames with unknown
        MAC-DA to a bridged LAN connected to RBridge edge ports.

         When an RBridge receives a TRILL frame whose destination
         Nickname matches with its own, the normal procedure is for the
         RBridge to decapsulate the TRILL header and forward the
         decapsulated Ethernet frame to the directly attached bridged
         LAN. If the destination MAC is unknown, the normal
         Ethernet switch's flooding will occurs to the decapsulated
         Ethernet frame. With directory assistance, the egress RBridge
         can determine if DA in a frame matches with any end stations
         attached via the bridged LAN. Frames can be discarded if their
         DAs do not match.

      - Reduce the amount of MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge mapping
        maintained by edge RBridges. There is no need for an edge
        RBridge to keep MAC entries of remote end stations that don't
        communicate with the end stations locally attached.

5. Generic operation of Directory Assistance

   5.1. Information in Directory for Edge Bridges

   To achieve the benefits of directory service for TRILL, the
   corresponding directory server entries will need, at a minimum, the
   following logical attributes:

   [IP, MAC, attached RBridge nickname, {list of interested RBridges}]

   The {list of interested RBridges} would get populated when an
   RBridge queries for information, or pushed down from management
   systems. The list is used to notify those RBridges whose
   connectivity to VMs changes due to VM migration or link failures.

   There can be two different models for RBridge edge node to be
   assisted by Directory Service: Push Model and Pull Model.



Dunbar, et al                                                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       TRILL Directory Assistance Framework      Oct 2012

   5.2. Push Model

   Under this model, Directory Server(s) push down the MAC&VLAN <->
   Egress RBridge mapping for all the end stations that might
   communicate with end stations attached to an RBridge edge node.
   Under this model, it is recommended that the ingress RBridge simply
   drops a data packet (instead of flooding to TRILL campus) if the
   packet's destination address can't be found in the MAC&VLAN<->Egress
   RBridge mapping table.

   It may not be necessary for every edge RBridge to get the entire
   mapping table for all the end stations in a data center. There are
   many ways to narrow the full set down to a smaller set of remote end
   stations that communicate with end stations attached to an edge
   RBridge. A simple approach of only pushing down the mapping for the
   VLANs that have active end stations under an edge RBridge can reduce
   the number of mapping entries being pushed down.

   However, the Push Model usually will push down more entries of
   MAC&VLAN<->Egress RBridge mapping to edge RBridges than needed.
   Under the normal process of edge RBridge cache aging and unknown DA
   flooding, rarely used mapping entries would have been removed. But
   it can be difficult for Directory Servers to predict the
   communication patterns among applications within one VLAN.
   Therefore, it is likely that the Directory Servers will push down
   all the MAC&VLAN entries if there are end stations in the VLAN being
   attached to the edge RBridge. This is a major disadvantage of the
   Push Model compared with the Pull Model described below.

   In the Push Model, it is necessary to have a way for an RBridge node
   to request directory server(s) to start pushing down the mapping
   entries. This method should at least include the VLANs enabled on
   the RBridge, so that directory server doesn't need to push down the
   entire mapping entries for all the end stations in the data center.
   An RBridge node must be able to get mapping entries when it is
   initialized or restarted.

   The detailed method and hand-shake mechanism between RBridge and
   Directory Server(s) is beyond the scope of this framework draft.

   When directory server needs to push down a very large number of
   entries to edge RBridges, summarization should be considered. For
   example, with one edge RBridge Nickname being associated with all
   attached end stations' MAC addresses and VLANs as shown below:

            Table 1: Summarized table pushed down from directory

   Whenever there is any change in MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge mapping,
   that can be triggered by end stations being added, moved, or de-
   commissioned, an incremental update can be sent to the edge RBridges
   which are impacted by the change. Therefore, something like a
   sequence number has to be maintained by directory servers and
   RBridges. Detailed mechanisms will be specified in a separate draft.

   5.3. Pull Model

   Under this model, an RBridge pulls the MAC&VLAN<->Egress RBridge
   mapping entry from the directory server when its cache doesn't have
   the entry. There are several options to trigger the pulling process.
   For example, the RBridge edge node can send a pull request whenever
   it receives an unknown DA, or the RBridge edge node can simply
   intercept all ARP/ND requests and forward them to the Directory
   Server(s) that has the information on where the target stations are
   located. The ingress RBridge can cache the mapping pulled down from
   the directory.

   One advantage of the Pull Model is that edge RBridge can age out
   MAC&VLAN entries if they haven't been used for a certain configured
   period of time or a period of time provided by the Directory.
   Therefore, each edge RBridge will only keep the entries which are
   frequently used, so mapping table size can be smaller. Edge RBridges
   would query the Directory Server(s) for unknown DAs in data frames
   or ARP/ND and cache the response. When end stations attached to
   remote edge RBridges rarely communicate with the locally attached
   end stations, the corresponding MAC&VLAN entries would be aged out
   from the RBridge's cache.

Internet-Draft       TRILL Directory Assistance Framework      Oct 2012

   RBridge waiting for response from Directory Servers upon receiving a
   data frame with unknown DA is similar to a L2/L3 boundary router
   waiting for ARP/ND response upon receiving an IP data frame whose DA
   is not in the router's IP/MAC cache table. Most deployed routers
   today do hold the packets and send an ARP/ND requests to the target
   upon receiving a packet with DA not in its IP-MAC cache. When ARP/ND
   replies are received, the router will send the data frame to the
   target. This practice is to minimize flooding when targets don't
   exist in the subnet.

   When the target doesn't exist in the subnet, routers generally re-
   send ARP/ND request a few more times before dropping the packets.
   Therefore, the holding time by routers to wait for ARP/ND response
   can be longer than the time taken by the Pull Model to get IP-MAC
   mapping from directory if target doesn't exist in the subnet.

   A separate draft will specify the detailed messages and mechanism
   for edge RBridge to pull information from directory server(s).

6. Conclusion and Recommendation

    The traditional RBridge learning approach of observing data plane
    can no longer keep pace with the ever growing number of end stations
    in Data centers.

    Therefore, we suggest TRILL consider directory assisted approach(es).
    This draft only describes the basic framework of using directory
    assisted approach for RBridge edge nodes. More complete mechanisms
    will be described in separate drafts.



7. Security Considerations

    Accurate mapping of IP addresses into MAC addresses is important to
    the correct delivery of information. The security of specific
    directory assisted mechanisms will be discussed in the draft or
    drafts specifying those mechanisms.

    For general TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6325].
