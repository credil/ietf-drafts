Abstract

   With the rapid growth of networks around the globe there is an ever
   increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of devices.
   Operators begining to seek more information of power consumption in
   the network, have no standard mechanism to measure, report and
   compare power usage of different networking equipment under different
   network configuration and conditions exist.

   This document provides suggestions for measuring power usage of live
   networks under different traffic loads and various switch router
   configuration settings.  It provides a suite which can be deployed on
   any networking device .

1.  Introduction

   Energy Efficiency is becoming increasing important in the operation
   of network infrastructure.  Data traffic is exploding at an
   accelerated rate.  Networks provide communication channels that
   facilitates components of the infrastructues to exchange critical
   information and are always on.  On the other hand, a lot of devices
   run at very low average utlization rates.  Various strategies are
   being defined to improve network utilization of these devices and
   thus improve power consumption.

   The first step to obtain a network wide view is to start with an
   individual device view of the system and address different devices in
   the network on a per device basis.  The easiest way to measure the
   power consumption of a device is to use a power meter.  This can be
   used to measure power under a variety of conditions affecting power
   usage on a networking device.

   Various techniques have been defined for energy management of
   networking devices.  However, there is no common strategy to actually
   benchmark power utilization of networking devices like routers or
   switches.  This document defines the mechanism to correctly
   characterize and benchmark the power consumption of various
   networking devices so as to be able to correctly measure and compare
   the power usage of various devices.  This will enable intelligent
   decisions to optimize the power consumption for individual devices
   and the network as a whole.  Benchmark are also required to compare
   effectiveness of various energy optimization techniques.

   The Network Energy Consumption Rate (NECR) as well as Network Energy
   Proportionality Index (NEPI) is also defined here.

   The procedures/ metrics defined in this document have been used to
   perform live measurement with a variety of networking equipment from
   three large well known vendors.

2.  Challenges in defining benchmarks

   Using the "Maximum Rated Power" and spec sheets of devices and adding
   the values for all devices are of little use because the measurement
   gives the maximum power that can consumed by the device, however that
   does not accurately reflect the power consumed by the device under a
   normal work load.  Typical energy requirements of a networking device
   are dependent on device configuration and traffic.

   The ratio of the actual power consumed by the device on an average,
   to its maximum rated power varies widely across different device
   families.  Thus, relying merely on the maximum rated power can
   grossly overestimate the total energy consumed by networking
   equipment.

   There are a wide variety of networking equipment and finding a
   general benchmark to work across a variety of devices, requires a lot
   of flexibility in benchmarking methodology. the workload and test
   conditions will also depend on the kind of device.

   A network device consists of a lot of individual component, each of
   which consume power.  For example, only considering the power
   consumption of the CPU/ data forwarding ASIC we may ignore the power
   consumption of the other components like external memory.

   Power instrumentation of a device in a live network involves
   unplugging the device and plugging it into a power meter.  This can
   inturn lead to traffic loss.  Unfortunately, most current equipment
   is not equipped with internal instrumentation to report power usage
   of the device or its components.  It is for this reason the power
   measurement is done on an individual device under different network
   conditions using a traffic generator.

   The network devices can also dissipate significant heat.  Past
   studies have shown dissipation rations of 2.5.  Which means if the
   power in is 2.5 Watt, only 1 Watt is used for actual work, the rest
   is disspated as heat.  This heating can lead to more power consumed
   by fan/ compressor for cooling the devices.  Though this methodology
   does not measure the power consumed by external cooling
   infrastructure, it measures the power consumed internally.  It also
   (optionally) measures the temperature change of the device which can
   be correlated to the amount of external power consumed to cool the
   device.

   The amount of power used at startup can be more than the average
   power usage of the device.  This is also measured as part of the test
   methodology.

3.  Factors for power consumption

   The metrics defined here will help operators get a more accurate idea
   of power consumed by network equipment and hence forecast their power
   budget.  These will also help device vendors test and compare the new
   power efficiency enhancements on various devices.

3.1.  Network Factors affecting power consumption

   The first and the most important factor from the network perspective
   which can determine the power consumption is the traffic load.
   Benchmarks must be performed with different traffic loads in the
   network.

   There are now various kinds of transcivers/ connectors on a network
   device.  For the same bandwidth the power usage of a device depends
   on the kind of connector used.  The connector/ interface type used
   needs to be specified in the benchmark.

   The length of the cable used also defines the amount of power
   consumed by the system.  Benchmarks should specify the cable length
   used.  For example, a 5 meter cable can be used wherever possible.

3.2.  Device Factors affecting power consumption

   Base Chassis Power - typically, higher end network devices come with
   a chassis and card slots.  Each slot may have a number of ports.  For
   the lower end devices there are no removable card slots.  In both
   these cases the base chassis power consists of processors, fans,
   memory, etc.

   Number of line cards - In switches that support inserting linecards,
   there is a limit on the number of ports per linecard as well as the
   aggregate bandwidth that each linecard can accommodate.  This
   mechanism allows network operators the flexibility to only plug in as
   many linecards as they need.  For each benchmark the total number of
   line cards plugged into the system needs to be specified.

   Number of active ports - This term refers to the total number of
   ports on the switch (across all the linecards) that are active (with
   cables plugged in).  The remaining ports on the switch are explicitly
   disabled using the switchs command line interface.  For each
   benchmark the number of active and passive ports must be specified.

   Port settings - Setting this parameter limits the line rate
   forwarding capacity of individual ports.  For each benchmark the port
   configuration and settings need to be specified.

Internet-Draft      Power Benchmarking for Networking       January 2013


   Port Utilization - This term describes the actual throughput flowing
   through a port relative to its specified capacity.  For each
   benchmark the port utilization of each port must be specified.  The
   actual traffic can use the information defined in RFC 2544 [RFC2544].

   TCAM - Network vendors typically implement packet classification in
   hardware.  TCAMs are supported by most vendors as they have very fast
   look-up times.  However, they are are notoriously power-hungry.  The
   size of the TCAM in a switch is widely variable.  The size of the
   TCAM needs to be reported in the benchmark document.  The number of
   TCAM entries does not affect power consumption.

   Firmware - Vendors periodically release upgraded versions of their
   switch/router firmware.  Different versions of firmware may also
   impact the device power consumption.  The firmware version needs to
   be reported in the benchmark document.  Different firmware versions
   have resulted in different power usage.

3.3.  Traffic Factors affecting power consumption

   Packet Size - Different packet sizes typically do not effect power
   consumption.

   Inter-Packet Delay - time between successive packets may affect power
   usage but we do not measure the effects in detail.

   CPU traffic - Percentage of CPU traffic.  For our benchmarks we can
   assume different values of CPU bound traffic.  The different
   percentage of CPU bound traffic must be specified in the benchmark.

4.  Network Energy Consumption Rate (NECR)

   To optimize the run time energy usage for different devices, the
   additional energy consumption that will result as a factor of
   additional traffic needs to be known.  The NECR defines the power
   usage increase in MilliWatts per Mbps of data at the physical layer.

   The NECR will depend on the line card, the port and the other factors
   defined earlier.

   For the effective use of the NECR the base power of the chassis, a
   line card and a port needs to be specified when there is no load.
   The measurements must take into consideration power optimization
   techniques when there is no traffic on any port of a line card.

5.  Network Energy Proportionality Index (NEPI)

   In the ideal case the power consumed by a device is proportional to
   its network load.  The average difference between the ideal(I) and
   the measured (M) power consumption defines the EPI.

   The ideal power is measured by assuming the power consumed by a
   device at 100% traffic load and using that to derive the ideal power
   usage for different traffic loads.

   EPIx = (Mx - Ix)/ Mx * 100

   EPI = EPI1 + EPI2 + .......  EPIn / n

   The EPI is independent of the actualy traffic load.  It can thus be
   used to define the energy efficiency of a networking device.  A value
   of 0 means the power usage is agnostic to traffic and a value of 100
   means that the device has perfect energy proportionality.
