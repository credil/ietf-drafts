             Advice for Safe Handling of Malformed Messages
                  draft-ietf-appsawg-malformed-mail-03

Abstract

   The email ecosystem has long had a very permissive set of common
   processing rules in place, despite increasingly rigid standards
   governing its components, ostensibly to improve the user experience.
   The handling of these come at some cost, and various components are
   faced with decisions about whether or not to permit non-conforming
   messages to continue toward their destinations unaltered, adjust them
   to conform (possibly at the cost of losing some of the original
   message), or outright rejecting them.

   This document includes a collection of the best advice available
   regarding a variety of common malformed mail situations, to be used
   as implementation guidance.  It must be emphasized, however, that the
   intent of this document is not to standardize malformations or
   otherwise encourage their proliferation.  The messages are manifestly
   malformed, and the code and culture that generates them needs to be
   fixed.  Therefore, these messages should be rejected outright if at
   all possible.  Nevertheless, many malformed messages from otherwise
   legitimate senders are in circulation and will be for some time, and,
   unfortunately, commercial reality shows that we cannot always simply
   reject or discard them.  Accordingly, this document presents
   alternatives for dealing with them in ways that seem to do the least
   additional harm until the infrastructure is tightened up to match the
   standards.

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  The Purpose Of This Work

   The history of email standards, going back to [RFC822] and beyond,
   contains a fairly rigid evolution of specifications.  But
   implementations within that culture have also long had an
   undercurrent known formally as the robustness principle, but also
   known informally as Postel's Law: "Be conservative in what you do, be
   liberal in what you accept from others."

   In general, this served the email ecosystem well by allowing a few
   errors in implementations without obstructing participation in the
   game.  The proverbial bar was set low.  However, as we have evolved
   into the current era, some of these lenient stances have begun to
   expose opportunities that can be exploited by malefactors.  Various
   email-based applications rely on strong application of these
   standards for simple security checks, while the very basic building
   blocks of that infrastructure, intending to be robust, fail utterly
   to assert those standards.

   This document presents some areas in which the more lenient stances
   can provide vectors for attack, and then presents the collected
   wisdom of numerous applications in and around the email ecosystem for
   dealing with them to mitigate their impact.

1.2.  Not The Purpose Of This Work

   It is important to understand that this work is not an effort to
   endorse or standardize certain common malformations.  The code and
   culture that introduces such messages into the mail stream needs to
   be repaired, as the security penalty now being paid for this lax
   processing arguably outweighs the reduction in support costs to end
   users who are not expected to understand the standards.  However, the
   reality is that this will not be fixed quickly.

   Given this, it is beneficial to provide implementers with guidance
   about the safest or most effective way to handle malformed messages
   when they arrive, taking into consideration the tradeoffs of the
   choices available especially with respect to how various actors in
   the email ecosystem respond to such messages in terms of handling,
   parsing, or rendering to end users.

1.3.  General Considerations

   Many deviations from message format standards are considered by some
   receivers to be strong indications that the message is undesirable,
   i.e., is spam or contains malware.  Such receivers quickly decide



Kucherawy & Shapiro      Expires April 12, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


   that the best handling choice is simply to reject or discard the
   message.  This means malformations caused by innocent
   misunderstandings or ignorance of proper syntax can cause messages
   with no ill intent also to fail to be delivered.

   Senders that want to ensure message delivery are best advised to
   adhere strictly to the relevant standards (including, but not limited
   to, [MAIL], [MIME], and [DKIM]), as well as observe other industry
   best practices such as may be published from time to time either by
   the IETF or independently.

2.  Document Conventions

2.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].  However,
   they only have that meaning in this document when they are presented
   entirely in upper case.

2.2.  Examples

   Examples of message content include a number within braces at the end
   of each line.  These are line numbers for use in subsequent
   discussion, and are not actually part of the message content
   presented in the example.

   Blank lines are not numbered in the examples.

3.  Background

   The reader would benefit from reading [EMAIL-ARCH] for some general
   background about the overall email architecture.  Of particular
   interest is the Internet Message Format, detailed in [MAIL].
   Throughout this document, the use of the term "messsage" should be
   assumed to mean a block of text conforming to the Internet Message
   Format.

4.  Internal Representations

   Any agent handling a message could have one or two (or more) distinct
   representations of a message it is handling.  One is an internal
   representation, such as a block of storage used for the header and a
   block for the body.  These may be sorted, encoded, decoded, etc., as
   per the needs of that particular module.  The other is the
   representation that is output to the next agent in the handling
   chain.  This might be identical to the version that is input to the



Kucherawy & Shapiro      Expires April 12, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


   module, or it might have some changes such as added or reordered
   header fields, body modifications to remove malicious content, etc.

   In some cases, advice is provided only for internal representations.
   However, there is often occasion to mandate changes to the output as
   well.

5.  Invariate Content

   Experience has shown that it is beneficial to ensure that, from the
   first analysis agent at ingress into the destination Administrative
   Management Domain (ADMD; see [EMAIL-ARCH]) to the agent that actually
   affects delivery to the end user, the message each agent sees is
   identical.  Absent this, it can be impossible for different agents in
   the chain to make assertions about the content that correlate.

   For example, suppose a handling agent records that a message had some
   specific set of properties at ingress to the ADMD, then permitted it
   to continue inbound.  Some other agent alters the content for some
   reason.  The user, on viewing the delivered content, reports the
   message as abusive.  If the report is based on the set of properties
   recorded at ingress, then the complaint effectively references a
   message different from what the user saw, which could render the
   complaint inactionable.  Similarly, a message with properties that a
   filtering agent might use to reject an abusive message could be
   allowed to reach the user if an intermediate agent altered the
   message in a manner that alters one of those properties, thwarting
   detection of the abuse.

   Therefore, agents comprising an inbound message processing
   environment SHOULD ensure that each agent sees the same content, and
   the message reaches the end user unmodified.  An exception to this is
   content that is identitfied as certainly harmful, such as some kind
   of malicious executable software included in the message.

6.  Mail Submission Agents

   Within the email context, the single most influential component that
   can reduce the presence of malformed items in the email system is the
   Mail Submission Agent (MSA).  This is the component that is
   essentially the interface between end users that create content and
   the mail stream.

   The lax processing described earlier in the document creates a high
   support and security cost overall.  Thus, MSAs MUST evolve to become
   more strict about enforcement of all relevant email standards,
   especially [MAIL] and the [MIME] family of documents.

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


   Relay Mail Transport Agents (MTAs) SHOULD also be more strict;
   although preventing the dissemination of malformed messages is
   desirable, the rejection of such mail already in transit also has a
   support cost, namely the creation of a [DSN] that many end users
   might not understand.

7.  Line Terminaton

   The only valid line separation sequence in messaging is ASCII 0x0D
   ("carriage return", or CR) followed by ASCII 0x0A ("line feed", or
   LF), commonly referred to as CRLF.  Common UNIX user tools, however,
   typically only use LF for line termination.  This means the protocol
   has to convert LF to CRLF before transporting a message.

   Naive implementations can cause messages to be transmitted with a mix
   of line terminations, such as LF everywhere except CRLF only at the
   end of the message.  According to [SMTP], this means the entire
   message actually exists on a single line.

   A "naked" CR or LF in a message has no reasonable justification, and
   furthermore [MIME] presents mechanisms for encoding content that
   actually does need to contain such an unusual character sequence.

   Thus, handling agents MUST treat naked CRs and LFs as CRLFs when
   interpreting the message.

8.  Header Anomalies

   This section covers common syntactical and semantic anomalies found
   in headers of messages, and presents preferred mitigations.

8.1.  Converting Obsolete and Invalid Syntaxes

   There are numerous cases of obsolete header syntaxes that can be
   applied to confound agents with variable processing.  This section
   presents some examples of these.  Messages including them SHOULD be
   rejected; where this is not possible, RECOMMENDED internal
   interpretations are provided.

8.1.1.  Host-Address Syntax

   The following obsolete syntax:

       To: <@example.net:fran@example.com>

   should be interpreted as:

       To: <fran@example.com>



Kucherawy & Shapiro      Expires April 12, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


8.1.2.  Excessive Angle Brackets

   The following over-use of angle brackets, e.g.:

       To: <<<user2@example.org>>>

   should be interpreted as:

       To: <user2@example.org>

8.1.3.  Unbalanced Angle Brackets

   The following use of unbalanced angle brackets:

       To: <another@example.net
       To: second@example.org>

   should be interpreted as:

       To: <another@example.net>
       To: second@example.org

8.1.4.  Unbalanced Parentheses

   The following use of unbalanced parentheses:

       To: (Testing <fran@example.com>
       To: Testing) <sam@example.com>

   should be interpreted as:

       To: (Testing) <fran@example.com>
       To: "Testing)" <sam@example.com>

8.1.5.  Unbalanced Quotes

   The following use of unbalanced quotation marks:

       To: "Joe <joe@example.com>

   should be interpreted as:

       To: "Joe <joe@example.com>"@example.net

   where "example.net" is the domain name or host name of the handling
   agent making the interpretation.

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


8.2.  Non-Header Lines

   It has been observed that some messages contain a line of text in the
   header that is not a valid message header field of any kind.  For
   example:

       From: user@example.com {1}
       To: userpal@example.net {2}
       Subject: This is your reminder {3}
       about the football game tonight {4}
       Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2010 20:53:35 -0400 {5}

       Don't forget to meet us for the tailgate party! {7}

   The cause of this is typically a bug in a message generator of some
   kind.  Line {4} was intended to be a continuation of line {3}; it
   should have been indented by whitespace as set out in Section 2.2.3
   of [MAIL].

   This anomaly has varying impacts on processing software, depending on
   the implementation:

   1.  some agents choose to separate the header of the message from the
       body only at the first empty line (i.e. a CRLF immediately
       followed by another CRLF);

   2.  some agents assume this anomaly should be interpreted to mean the
       body starts at line {4}, as the end of the header is assumed by
       encountering something that is not a valid header field or folded
       portion thereof;

   3.  some agents assume this should be interpreted as an intended
       header folding as described above and thus simply append a single
       space character (ASCII 0x20) and the content of line {4} to that
       of line {3};

   4.  some agents reject this outright as line {4} is neither a valid
       header field nor a folded continuation of a header field prior to
       an empty line.

   This can be exploited if it is known that one message handling agent
   will take one action while the next agent in the handling chain will
   take another.  Consider, for example, a message filter that searches
   message headers for properties indicative of abusive of malicious
   content that is attached to a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) implementing
   option 2 above.  An attacker could craft a message that includes this
   malformation at a position above the property of interest, knowing
   the MTA will not consider that content part of the header, and thus



Kucherawy & Shapiro      Expires April 12, 2013                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


   the MTA will not feed it to the filter, thus avoiding detection.
   Meanwhile, the Mail User Agent (MUA) which presents the content to an
   end user, implements option 1 or 3, which has some undesirable
   effect.

   It should be noted that a few implementations choose option 4 above
   since any reputable message generation program will get header
   folding right, and thus anything so blatant as this malformation is
   likely an error caused by a malefactor.

   The preferred implementation if option 4 above is not employed is to
   apply the following heuristic when this malformation is detected:

   1.  Search forward for an empty line.  If one is found, then apply
       option 3 above to the anomalous line, and continue.

   2.  Search forward for another line that appears to be a new header
       field, i.e., a name followed by a colon.  If one is found, then
       apply option 3 above to the anomalous line, and continue.

8.3.  Unusual Spacing

   The following message is valid per [MAIL]:

       From: user@example.com {1}
       To: userpal@example.net {2}
       Subject: This is your reminder {3}
        {4}
        about the football game tonight {5}
       Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2010 20:53:35 -0400 {6}

       Don't forget to meet us for the tailgate party! {8}

   Line {4} contains a single whitespace.  The intended result is that
   lines {3}, {4}, and {5} comprise a single continued header field.
   However, some agents are aggressive at stripping trailing whitespace,
   which will cause line {4} to be treated as an empty line, and thus
   the separator line between header and body.  This can affect header-
   specific processing algorithms as described in the previous section.

   Ideally, this case simply ought not to be generated.

   Message handling agents receiving a message bearing this anomaly MUST
   behave as if line {4} was not present on the message, and SHOULD emit
   a version in which line {4} has been removed.

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


8.4.  Header Malformations

   There are various malformations that exist.  A common one is
   insertion of whitespace at unusual locations, such as:

       From: user@example.com {1}
       To: userpal@example.net {2}
       Subject: This is your reminder {3}
       MIME-Version : 1.0 {4}
       Content-Type: text/plain {5}
       Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2010 20:53:35 -0400 {6}

       Don't forget to meet us for the tailgate party! {8}

   Note the addition of whitespace in line {4} after the header field
   name but before the colon that separates the name from the value.

   The acceptance grammar of [MAIL] permits that extra whitespace, so it
   cannot be considered invalid.  However, a consensus of
   implementations prefers to remove that whitespace.  There is no
   perceived change to the semantics of the header field being altered
   as the whitespace is itself semantically meaningless.  Thus, a module
   compliant with this memo MUST remove all whitespace after the field
   name but before the colon, and MUST emit that version of that field
   on output.

8.5.  Header Field Counts

   Section 3.6 of [MAIL] prescribes specific header field counts for a
   valid message.  Few agents actually enforce these in the sense that a
   message whose header contents exceed one or more limits set there are
   generally allowed to pass; they may add any required fields that are
   missing, however.

   Also, few agents that use messages as input, including Mail User
   Agents (MUAs) that actually display messages to users, verify that
   the input is valid before proceeding.  Two popular open source
   filtering programs and two popular Mailing List Management (MLM)
   packages examined at the time this document was written select either
   the first or last instance of a particular field name, such as From,
   to decide who sent a message.  Absent enforcement of [MAIL], an
   attacker can craft a message with multiple fields if that attacker
   knows the filter will make a decision based on one but the user will
   be shown the other.

   This situation is exacerbated when a claim of message validity is
   inferred by something like a valid [DKIM] signature.  Such a
   signature might cover one instance of a constrained field but not



Kucherawy & Shapiro      Expires April 12, 2013                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


   another, and a naive consumer of DKIM's output, not realizing which
   one was covered by a valid signature, could presume the wrong one was
   the "good" one.  An MUA, for example could show the first of two From
   fields as "good" or "safe" while the DKIM signature actually only
   verified the second.

   Thus, an agent compliant with this specification MUST enact one of
   the following:

   1.  reject outright or refuse to process further any input message
       that does not conform to Section 3.6 of [MAIL];

   2.  remove or, in the case of an MUA, refuse to render any instances
       of a header field whose presence exceeds a limit prescribed in
       Section 3.6 of [MAIL] when generating its output;

   3.  alter the name of any header field whose presence exceeds a limit
       prescribed in Section 3.6 of [MAIL] when generating its output so
       that later agents can produce a consistent result.  Any
       alteration likely to cause the field to be ignored by downstream
       agents is acceptable.  A common approach is to prefix the field
       names with a string such as "BAD-".

8.6.  Missing Header Fields

   Similar to the previous section, there are messages seen in the wild
   that lack certain required header fields.  For example, [MAIL]
   requires that a From and Date field be present in all messages.

   When presented with a message lacking these fields, the MTA might
   perform one of the following:

   1.  Make no changes

   2.  Add an instance of the missing field(s) using synthesized content

   Option 2 is RECOMMENDED for handling this case.  Handling agents
   SHOULD add these for internal hanlding if they are missing, but MUST
   NOT add them to the external representation.  The reason for this
   requirement is that there are some filter modules that would consider
   the absence of such fields to be a condition warranting special
   treatment (e.g., rejection), and thus the effectiveness of such
   modules would be stymied by an upstream filter adding them.

   The synthesized fields SHOULD contain a best guess as to what should
   have been there; for From, the SMTP MAIL command's address can be
   used (if not null) or a placeholder address followed by an address
   literal (e.g., unknown@[192.0.2.1]); for Date, a date extracted from

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


   a Received field is a reasonable choice.

   One other important case to consider is a missing Message-Id field.
   An MTA that encounters a message missing this field SHOULD synthesize
   a valid one using techniques described above and add it to the
   external rpresentation, since many deployed tools use the content of
   that field as a common unique message reference, so its absence
   inhibits correlation of message processing.  One possible synthesis
   would be based on based on an encoding of the current date/time and
   an internal MTA ID (e.g., queue ID) followed by @ and the fully
   qualified hostname of the machine synthesizing the header value.  For
   example:

       tm = gmtime(&now);
       (void) snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%04d%02d%02d%02d%02d.%s@%s",
                       tm->tm_year + 1900, tm->tm_mon + 1, tm->tm_mday,
                       tm->tm_hour, tm->tm_min, queueID, fqhn);

8.7.  Eight-Bit Data

   Standards-compliant mail messages do not contain any non-ASCII data
   without indicating that such content is present by means of published
   [SMTP] extensions.  Absent that, [MIME] encodings are typically used
   to convert non-ASCII data to ASCII in a way that can be reversed by
   other handling agents or end users.

   Non-ASCII data otherwise found in messages can confound code that is
   used to analyze content.  For example, a null (ASCII 0x00) byte
   inside a message can cause typical string processing functions to
   mis-identify the end of a string, which can be exploited to hide
   malicious content from analysis processes.

   Handling agents MUST reject messages containing null bytes that are
   not encoded in some standard way, and SHOULD reject other non-ASCII
   bytes that are similarly not encoded.  If rejection is not done, an
   ASCII-compatible encoding such as those defined in [MIME] SHOULD be
   used.

9.  MIME Anomalies

   [MIME], et seq, define a mechanism of message extensions for
   providing text in character sets other than ASCII, non-text
   attachments to messages, multi-part message bodies, and similar
   facilities.

   Some anomalies with MIME-compliant generation are also common.  This
   section discusses some of those and presents preferred mitigations.

9.1.  Header Field Names

   [MAIL] permits header field names to begin with "--".  This means
   that a header field name can look like a [MIME] multipart boundary.
   For example:

     --foo:bar

   This is a legal header field, whose name is "--foo" and whose value
   is "bar".  Thus, consider this header:

       From: user@example.com {1}
       To: userpal@example.net {2}
       Subject: This is your reminder {3}
       Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2010 20:53:35 -0400 {4}
       MIME-Version: 1.0 {5}
       Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="foo:bar" {6}
       --foo:bar {7}
       Malicious-Content: muahaha {8}

   One implementation could observe that line {7} announces the
   beginning of the first MIME part while another considers it a part of
   the message's header.

   If rejection of such messages cannot be done, agents MUST treat line
   {7} as part of the message's header block and not a MIME boundary.

9.2.  Missing MIME-Version Field

   Any message that uses [MIME] constructs is required to have a MIME-
   Version header field.  Without them, the Content-Type and associated
   fields have no semantic meaning.

   It is often observed that a message has complete MIME structure, yet
   lacks this header field.

   As described at the end of Section 8.2, this is not expected from a
   reputable content generator and is often an indication of mass-
   produced spam or other undesirable messages.

   Therefore, an agent compliant with this specification MUST internally
   enact one or more of the following in the absence of a MIME-Version
   header field:

   1.  Ignore all other MIME-specific fields, even if they are
       syntactically valid, thus treating the entire message as a
       single-part message of type text/plain;

Internet-Draft             Safe Mail Handling               October 2012


   2.  Remove all other MIME-specific fields, even if they are
       syntactically valid, both internally and when emitting the output
       version of the message;

10.  Body Anomalies

10.1.  Oversized Lines

   A message containing a line of content that exceeds 998 characters
   plus the line terminator (1000 total) violates Section 2.1.1 of
   [MAIL].  Some handling agents may not look at content in a single
   line past the first 998 bytes, providing bad actors an opportunity to
   hide malicious content.

   There is no specified way to handle such messages, other than to
   observe that they are non-compliant and reject them, or rewrite the
   oversized line such that the message is compliant.

   Handling agents MUST take one of the following actions:

   1.  Break such lines into multiple lines at a position that does not
       change the semantics of the text being thus altered.  For
       example, breaking an oversized line such that a [URI] then spans
       two lines could inhibit the proper identification of that URI.

   2.  Rewrite the MIME part (or the entire message if not MIME) that
       contains the excessively long line using a content encoding that
       breaks the line in the transmission but would still result in the
       line being intact on decoding for presentation to the user.  Both
       of the encodings declared in [MIME] can accomplish this.

11.  Security Considerations

   The discussions of the anomalies above and their prescribed solutions
   are themselves security considerations.  The practises enumerated in
   this memo are generally perceived as attempts to resolve security
   considerations that already exist rather than introducing new ones.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This memo contains no actions for IANA.
