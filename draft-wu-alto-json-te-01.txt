JSON Format Extensions for Traffic Engineering (TE) performance metrics
               in the ALTO Information Resource Directory
                        draft-wu-alto-json-te-01

Abstract

   The base ALTO specification defines two properties for cost metric
   attribute in the Cost MAP, including 'hopcount' and 'routingcost'.
   This specification define five new cost metric and one new parameter
   for Traffic Engineering(TE) performance information in the ALTO
   Information Resource Directory: Link Delay, Delay Variation, Packet
   Loss, Residual Bandwidth, Available Bandwidth,linkstate.  They can be
   used either as constraint attribute associated with cost metric
   attribute 'routingcost' or returned cost metric in the response.

1.  Introduction

   The ALTO protocol [I.D-ietf-alto-protocol] uses a REST-ful design ,
   and encodes its requests and responses using JSON.  In ALTO
   architecture [I.D-ietf-alto-protocol], the ALTO server allows alto
   information to be gathered from multiple systems(e.g., routing
   protocol).  [I.D-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions] describes extensions
   to OSPF TE called "OSPF TE Metric Extensions", that can be used to
   distribute network performance information (such as link delay, delay
   variation, packet loss, residual bandwidth, and available bandwidth).
   The mechanism defined in [I.D-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions]can be
   used by an ALTO Server to retrieve the necessary performance
   information supplementing the prefix and network topology data
   gathered from other sources in the underlying network.

   In the ALTO Information Resource Directory, Network and Cost Map are
   two core ALTO Information provided to clients.  The TE performance
   metric can be represented using Cost MAP.  The base ALTO
   specification [I.D-ietf- alto-protocol] defines one typical cost
   metric attribute for Cost Type in the Cost MAP
   (i.e.,'routingcost')and uses constraint attribute to list additional
   constraints to which elements of the Cost Map are related.  This
   specification defines five new cost map attributes and one property
   associated with these attributes in alto information service: Link
   Delay, Link Jitter,Packet Loss, Residual Bandwidth, Available
   Bandwidth,linkstate.  These five attribute and one new parameter can
   be either used as constraint attribute associated with 'routingcost'
   cost metric attribute or used as returned Cost Map in the response.

3.  Cost Map constraint Extensions:

   Section 10.2.2.3 of "ALTO: Application Layer Traffic Optimization
   Protocol" [I.D-ietf-alto-protocol] states:
   "
   object {
        CostType   cost-type;
        [JSONString constraints<0..*>;]
        [PIDFilter  pids;]
      } ReqFilteredCostMap;

   object {
        PIDName srcs<0..*>;
        PIDName dsts<0..*>;
      } PIDFilter;

   with members:

   cost-type  The CostType (Section 9.7) for the returned costs.  The
   cost-metric and cost-mode fields MUST match one of the supported
   Cost Types indicated in this resource's capabilities
   (Section 10.2.2.4).  The ALTO Client SHOULD omit the description
   field, and if present, the ALTO Server MUST ignore the description
   field.

   constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which
   elements of the Cost Map are returned.  This parameter MUST NOT be
   specified if this resource's capabilities ( Section 10.2.2.4)
   indicate that constraint support is not available.  A constraint
   contains two entities separated by whitespace: (1) an operator,
    'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for greater than
   or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for equal to;
   (2) a target cost value.  The cost value is a number that MUST be
   defined in the same units as the Cost Metric indicated by the
   cost-metric parameter.  ALTO Servers SHOULD use at least IEEE 754
   double-precision floating point [IEEE.754.2008] to store the cost
   value, and SHOULD perform internal computations using double-
   precision floating-point arithmetic.  If multiple 'constraint'
   parameters are specified, they are interpreted as being related to
   each other with a logical AND.
   "

   In the JSON Object of type ReqFilteredCostMap, the constraint
   attribute is expressed as:

   "
   [gt | lt | ge | le | eq ] <value>
   "

   In this specification, the constraint attribute is changed to

      "
   <cost-type2>  [gt | lt | ge | le | eq ] <value>
      "

   Accordingly, the constraints definition is changed to:

  "
  constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which
  elements of the Cost Map are returned.  This parameter MUST NOT be
  specified if this resource's capabilities ( Section 10.2.2.4)
  indicate that constraint support is not available.  A constraint
  contains three entities separated by whitespace: (1)an cost type
  is by default cost-type in the JSON Object of type ReqFilteredCostMap.
  In addition, it could be another cost-type used for the returned cost
  (2) an operator, 'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for
  greater than or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for
  equal to; (3) a target cost value.  The cost value is a number that
  MUST be defined in the same units as the Cost Metric indicated by the
  cost-metric parameter.  ALTO Servers SHOULD use at least IEEE 754
  double-precision floating point [IEEE.754.2008] to store the cost
  value, and SHOULD perform internal computations using double-
  precision floating-point arithmetic.  If multiple 'constraint'
  parameters are specified, they are interpreted as being related to
  each other with a logical AND.

              }

4.5.  Attribute: availablebandwidth

 Namespace:

 Attribute name:  availablebandwith

 Purpose:  To specify the available bandwidth on a link between two
           directly connected neighboring peers. For a link, available
           bandwidth is defined to be residual bandwidth  minus the
           measured bandwidth used for the actual forwarding of non-
           RSVP-TE packets.  For a bundled link, available bandwidth
           is defined to be the sum of the component link available
           bandwidths.

 Value type:  A single number value containing an integer component that
               may be prefixed with an optional minus sign, which may
               be followed by a fraction part and/or an exponent part.

 Cardinality:  *1

 Attribute parameters:  linkstate


 Description: This is intended to be a new cost metric. It can
 be either used as constraint attribute value used together
 with 'routing cost' cost metric attribute or used as returned
  cost metric in the response.'routingcost' may also be used
 with other cost constraint attributes that is used to specify
 cost constraints.If 'availablebw' is present, 'routingcost'
 MUST have at most one 'availablebw'.

 Cost mode:  A Cost Mode is encoded as a US-ASCII string.
 The string MUST either have the value 'numerical' or 'ordinal'.

5.  Cost Metric Extensions: Parameters

   The following sections define Parameters used within cost metrics
   Definitions in the section 3.

5.1.  Parameter: linkstate

  Namespace:

  Parameter name:  linkstate

  Purpose:  Used in a multi-valued property to
            indicate whether it is steady state
            link performance.

  Description:  When a property is multi-valued,
     LINKSTATE can be used to construct a steady state
     Performance topology for initial tunnel path computation,
     or to verify alternative failover paths. The LINSTATE
     is set when the measured value of this parameter exceeds
     its configured maximum threshold.  The LINKSTATE is
     cleared when the measured value falls below its
     configured threshold. LINKSTATE should be used
     together with Cost metric we defined in the
     section 3. Cost Metrics prefixed with 'lss:' are
     reserved for cost metric that is not steady state
     link performance. Cost Metrics without prefix 'lss:'
     indicate the cost metrics are steady state link performace.

  Examples:

  POST /endpointcost/lookup HTTP/1.1
  Host: alto.example.com
  Content-Length: 195
  Content-Type: application/alto-endpointcostparams+json
  Accept: application/alto-endpointcost+json,application/alto-error+json

    {
      "cost-type": {"cost-mode" : "numerical",
       "cost-metric" : "routingcost"},
      "constraints" : {"linkdelay ls 15"},
      "endpoints" : {
        "srcs": [ "ipv4:192.0.2.2" ],
        "dsts": [

          "ipv4:198.51.100.34",
          "ipv4:203.0.113.45"
