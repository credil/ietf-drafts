Internet-Draft   DHCPv6 client link-layer address option       July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an optional mechanism and the related
   DHCPv6 option to allow DHCPv6 client or first hop DHCPv6 relay agent
   directly connected to the client to populate client link-layer
   address in the DHCPv6 messages being sent towards the server.


2.  Problem Background and Scenario

   DHCPv4 protocol specification [RFC2131] provides a way to specify the
   client hardware address in the DHCPv4 message header.  DHCPv4 message
   header has 'htype' and 'chaddr' fields to specify client hardware
   address type and hardware address respectively.  The client hardware
   address thus learnt can be used by DHCPv4 server and relay in
   different ways.  In some of the deployments DHCPv4 servers use
   'chaddr' as a customer identifier and a key for lookup in the client
   lease database.

   With the incremental deployment of IPv6 to existing IPv4 networks,
   effectievly an enablement of dual-stack, there will be devices that
   act as both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients.  In service provider
   deployments, a typical DHCPv4 implemention will use the client
   hardware address as one of the keys to build DHCP client lease
   database.  In dual stack scenarios it is desirable for the operator
   to associate DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages as belonging to the same
   client interface based on an identifier that is already used by that
   operator such as the client hardware address.

   Currently, the DHCPv6 protocol specification [RFC3315] does not
   define a way for DHCP clients to specify client link-layer address in
   the DHCPv6 message sent towards DHCPv6 Server.  Similarly DHCPv6
   Relay or Server cannot glean client link-layer address from the
   contents of DHCPv6 message received.  DHCPv6 protocol specification
   mandates all clients to prepare and send DUID as the client
   identifier option in all the DHCPv6 message exchange.  However none
   of these methods provide a simple way to extract client's link-layer
   address.This presents a problem to an operator who is using an
   existing DHCPv4 system with the client hardware address as the
   customer identifier, and desires to correlate DHCPv6 assignments
   using the same identifier.  Modifying the system to use DUID based
   correlation across DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 is possible, but it requires a
   modification of the DHCPv4 system and associated back-ends.

   Providing an option in DHCPv6 messages to carry client link-layer
   address explicitly will help above mentioned scenarios.  For e.g. it
   can be used along with other identifiers to associate DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6 messages from a dual stack client.  Further, having client

   link-layer address in DHCPv6 will help in proving additional
   information in event debugging and logging related to the client at
   relay and server.  The proposed option may be used in wide range of
   networks, two notable deployment models are service provider and
   enterprise network environments.


3.  DHCPv6 Client Link-layer Address Option

   The format of the DHCPv6 Client Link-layer Address option is shown
   below.
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR  |           option-length       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    hardware type (16 bits)    |                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               |
   |               link-layer address (variable length)            |
   |                                                               |
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   option-code:        OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR (TBD)
   option-length:      2 + length of link-layer address
   hardware type:      Client Link-layer address type. The hardware type MUST be a
                       valid hardware type assigned by the IANA, as described in [RFC0826]
   link-layer address: Client Link-layer address.



4.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   All hosts or clients MAY include DHCPv6 Client link-layer address
   option in all the upstream DHCPv6 messages.


5.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior

   DHCPv6 Relay agents which are directly connected to clients/hosts MAY
   look for Client Link-layer Address option in the incoming DHCPv6
   client message.  Irrespective of the presence of client link-layer
   option in incomming DHCPv6 client messages, DHCPv6 Relay agents MAY
   include client link-layer address option in relayed DHCPv6 (RELAY-
   FORW) message.  The DHCPv6 Relay agent behaviour can depend on
   configuration that decides whether Client Link-layer Address option
   needs to be processed and included.

Internet-Draft   DHCPv6 client link-layer address option       July 2012


   In Relay chaining scenarios, any other relay agent other than first
   hop DHCPv6 Relay agent or DHCPv6 LDRA [RFC6221] MUST not add this
   option.


6.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   If DHCPv6 Server is configured to store or use client link-layer
   address, it SHOULD first look for the client link-layer address
   option in the RELAY-FORW DHCP message of the DHCPv6 Relay agent
   closest to the client.  In case it is not found, Server SHOULD look
   for client link-layer address option in the client DHCP message.
   Further, this behavior w.r.t the precedence of DHCPv6 server to look
   for Client link-layer address option can be overridden based upon the
   local policies.

   There is no requirement that a server return this option and its data
   in a downstream DHCP message.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to
   OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR from the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options"
   registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-
   parameters.xml).


8.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related DHCPv6 are described in section 23 of
   [RFC3315].
