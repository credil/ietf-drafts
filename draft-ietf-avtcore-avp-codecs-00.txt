          Update to Recommended Codecs for the AVP RTP Profile
                    draft-ietf-avtcore-avp-codecs-00

Abstract

   [RFC3551] defines the AVP RTP profile, which is the basis for many
   other profiles, such as SAVP [RFC3711], AVPF [RFC4585], and SAVPF
   [RFC5124].  This document updates [RFC3551] (and by extension, the
   profiles that build upon it) to reflect changes in audio codec usage
   since the document was originally published.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC3551] says that audio applications operating under the AVP
   profile SHOULD be able to send and receive PCMU and DVI4.  However,
   in practice, many RTP deployments do not support DVI4, and its
   utility is limited in the presence of much more modern codecs.  This
   document updates the recommended audio codec selection for the AVP
   profile to remove the SHOULD for DVI4.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Updates to RFC 3551

   The text of [RFC3551] is hereby updated as set forth below.

3.1.  Updates to Section 6

   In the final paragraph of Section 6, replace, "payload types 0 (PCMU)
   and 5 (DVI4)," with "payload type 0 (PCMU)."  Also, add a final
   sentence to this paragraph that states, "Some environments MAY make
   support for PCMU mandatory."

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations for
   [RFC3551].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks to Colin Perkins for suggesting this update.
