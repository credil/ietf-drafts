                 draft-enyedi-rtgwg-mrt-local-detour-00

Abstract

   IP and LDP Fast ReRoute using Maximally Redundant trees was defined
   in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  In this document we add a
   simple extension to that technique, which can guarantee to keep
   detours in the part of the network, where the failure happened.

1.  Introduction

   In the case of failure, Fast ReRoute using Maximally Redundant Trees
   (MRT-FRR) [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] use detours defined
   by two maximally redundant trees, which are not related to shortest
   paths at all.  Although there are heuristics for decreasing path
   lengths, which are sufficient in almost all situations, there is no
   strict guarantee to keep failure handling local.  This means that
   detours may cause temporal congestion even in those parts of the
   network, which are far from the original failure.

   This document defines a possible solution by using multiple pairs of
   maximally redundant trees in an IGP area.  Our solution introduce
   artificial "subareas", each having its own recovery, and use them to
   provide the best possible protection.  If both the Point of Local
   Repair (PLR) and the destination are in the same subarea, the detour
   can simply use one of the trees of that subarea, in this way never
   leaving the surroundings of the failure.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT):   A pair of trees where the path
      from any node X to the root R along the first tree and the path
      from the same node X to the root along the second tree share the
      minimum number of nodes and the minimum number of links.  Each
      such shared node is a cut-node.  Any shared links are cut-links.

   2-connected:   A graph that has no cut-nodes.  This is a graph that
      requires at least two nodes to be removed before gets partitioned.

   block:   Either a maximally 2-connected (induced) subgraph, a cut-
      link with with its endpoints, or an isolated node.

   DAG:   Directed Acyclic Graph - a digraph containing no directed
      cycle.

   ADAG:   Almost Directed Acyclic Graph - a digraph that can be
      transformed into a DAG whith removing a single node (the root
      node).

   GADAG:   Generalized ADAG - a digraph, which has only ADAGs as all of
      its blocks.

   PLR:   Point of Local Repair - the node neighboring the failed
      resource (which can be a node or a link), and which do the
      rerouting.

   Cut-node:   A node is a cut-node, if removing it partitions the
      network.

   Cut-link:   A link is a cut-link, if removing it partitions the
      network.

3.  Problem Description

   Consider the network and GADAG depicted in Figure 1 (for GADAG
   computation and finding FRR paths using a GADAG consult
   [I-D.enyedi-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm]).  Suppose that node H wants to
   send some packets to node I, but the link between them went down.
   Since node H is definitely lesser than node I, the detour must be the
   one that goes through R, i.e. H->G->C->B->A->R->F->E->J->I, even if
   there was a much shorter one through node D. The problem here is not
   that such path is long, but that the traffic may get far away from
   the failure, thus congestion may occur in any part of the network.

   There are already possibilities to mitigate the problem presented
   above.  First, there are heuristics that can be applied in order to
   decrease path lengths, thus paths in real networks are usually using
   detours not much longer than the shortest paths.  Even when
   heuristics cannot help (like in the network above), there is still
   some room for optimization by selecting the GADAG root better.  E.g.
   in the previous example selecting node D as a GADAG root can solve
   the problem (however it cannot solve anything if we add one more ring
   connected to A and R).  Finally, note that congestion can be caused
   only while IGP is doing the recovery, which is quite fast in most of
   the cases, in this way reducing the severity of this situation.

   This document describes a mechanism to give strict guarantees that
   detour does not get far from the failure.  This can be applied for
   special situations, when detours would be too long otherwise or in
   networks, where bandwidth guarantees are needed to be fulfilled in
   all cases.

4.  Artificial Islands

   MRT-FRR capable routers can handle multiple MRT profiles.  MRT
   profiles was introduced for handling routers with different
   capabilities, even those, which do not support MRT-FRR at all.
   Routers supporting the same profile create an MRT-FRR island in the
   IGP area.

   Each such island has its GADAG and its own redundant trees, which are
   only valid in that island.  If a packet gets out from an island, it
   gets back to the shortest path.  If the destination (or the area/AS
   border router) is inside the island where the failure happened, it is
   guaranteed that packet will never leave the island.  Basically
   islands are subareas with their own protection.

   Currently, islands are there only for handling capability differences
   between routers.  In this document, we introduce artificial islands,
   which are limiting packet detours to a part of the network.  In order
   to define such an island, operator needs only to configure routers in
   the desired subarea to advertise one more profile, which is is not
   supported by any other router in the network.  Naturally, this
   profile does not need to describe new capabilities, but it can differ
   from other profiles just in some extra ID field.  Therefore profile
   descriptor must be extended with such ID field.

   Operators may define islands arbitrary; the only restriction is that
   such islands must be connected, otherwise they would be considered as
   multiple connected islands.  Similarly, if an island is split into
   disjunct parts due to some failure, such parts can be handled as
   disjunct islands.  As an example, operators can define one island

   containing the whole IGP area, and some smaller ones for keeping up
   local failure handled when needed.  When a failure can be handled
   locally, a "small" island is used, while there is still the "big"
   island containing the whole area for the remaining cases.

   As an example of this scheme, consider the the previous network, and
   define artificial islands in it in order to keep packets inside the
   ring where the failure has happened.  The network and the two islands
   defined are depicted below.  Note that there should be a third island
   that contains all the nodes to handle failures that cannot be handled
   locally; this third island is not depicted in Figure 2.  Also note
   that having this third island is not mandatory, it can be not
   configured, if operator wants to disable global protection for some
   reason.

   Observe that Island1 and Island2 are not disjunct, instead both of
   them are containing node C, D and E, in this way making both islands
   2-connected.  This overlapping is the main difference compared to the
   situation when an area is split into two using MRT-ineligible links;
   if we would only disable the MRT capability for some links in this
   network, at least one of the resulting "subareas" (islands) would be
   not 2-connected, thus protection would be impossible in at least one
   of them.  Moreover thanks to overlapping, it is possible to define

   the third island and use it to provide protection when the PLR and
   the destination are not in the same ring (i.e. there is no local
   detour).

   Although it is useful for protection, note that operator do not
   always need to find 2-connected artificial islands, if there are
   considerations other than maximum protection.  Consider Figure 3 and
   suppose that in this network link L-F is not wanted to be used for
   local protection for some reason.  In this case, the two artificial
   islands for local protection are selected as depicted below.  If node
   M is going down, Island2 is split into two, so no local protection is
   possible in this case.  (Naturally, selecting Island2 is not
   pointless, if any link or any other node than M is going down, there
   is still local protection.)

   If a router is in multiple islands, selecting one for a concrete
   failure case is a local decision of the node and not defined in this
   document.  Vendors may make it possible to assign priority at each
   router for the artificial islands created.  Moreover, routers may
   take other differences into consideration as well, e.g. if there is

   node protecting path in one island but only link protecting in
   another one.

   Selecting the endpoint of detour is a local decision of MRT-FRR
   capable routers, it is not needed to select always the destination/
   border router as the endpoint, especially when not all the routers
   are supporting MRT-FRR and islands are formed (for details see
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture]).  If there are artificial
   islands the only difference is that a router may belong to multiple
   islands, so it may take into consideration all of those islands and
   select the best for that failure with respect to arbitrary local
   preference.

   For MRT-FRR, each router must have two extra addresses/labels per
   profile it supports.  The situation is the same if there are
   artificial islands applied, since a router in multiple islands must
   compute the MRTs for each of those islands, and it must be able to
   decide which of these trees is used.
