Abstract

   This memo proposes a new CoAP link format attribute, "geo", that can
   be used to associate positioning metadata to a CoAP resource.

1.  Introduction

   This memo proposes a new CoAP link-format attribute, "geo", that can
   be used to associate positioning metadata to a CoAP resource, and
   make this information available to other endpoints that, directly or
   indirectly, participate in to CoAP link-format discovery [RFC6690].

   The ability for a consuming application to access positioning
   information about a sensing resource is crucial in a number of use
   cases, especially those in which one or more sensor networks provide
   input to an emergency handling service (e.g. fire, flood, etc.).

   This spec reuses the geo URI syntax [RFC5870], which is capable to
   describe physical locations in two or three dimensions (also
   supporting underground and underwater localisation using negative
   numbers) in a compact, simple and human readable way.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Motivation and Use Cases

   Location-aware applications and location-based services like seismic
   networks, gas pipeline monitoring deployments, fire or flood
   detection systems, etc., need to precisely locate the source of
   sensed stimulus in order to react in a sensible way.

   {TODO collect other use cases}

3.  The geo Link Format Attribute

Internet-Draft        The geo Link-Format Attribute         October 2013


   This section defines a new Web Linking [RFC5988] link-param, "geo",
   to be used within the [RFC6690] framework, having the following
   syntax:

   link-extension  = "geo" "=" geo-path
   geo-path          ; defined in Section 3.3. of RFC 5870


   The geo attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in a link.

   (NOTE about Link-Format queries: non exact matches cannot be easily/
   effectively queried.)

4.  Examples

   o  A fire detector somewhere in the Pollino National Park:

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core

     RES: 2.05 Content
     </fire>;ct=40;if="sensor;geo="40,16.34"


   o  An underwater current sampler in the sea between Ithaki and
      Kefallonia:

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core

     RES: 2.05 Content
     </water>;ct=40;if="sensor;geo="38.295326,20.642624,-20"


5.  Encoding Considerations

   See Section 3.5. of [RFC5870].

6.  IANA Considerations

   TODO

7.  Security Considerations

   The "geo" link-format attributes share the same security issues as
   any other attribute involved in the discovery process described in
   [RFC6690].

   Further to that, the privacy considerations regarding distribution,
   protection, usage, retention, and storage of the location information
   of the target resource found in [RFC6280] fully apply.
