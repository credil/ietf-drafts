         Localized Routing for Multi-Home Mobile Node in PMIPv6
                    draft-cui-netext-multihome-lr-00 

Abstract

   In basic PMIPv6[RFC5213], Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) should forward
   all traffic for the registered MN.  Localized Routing (LR) for PMIPv6
   proposed in [RFC6705] allows MN to exchange data directly by using
   localized forwarding or tunnel between the MAGs.  But in some multi-
   access scenarios, it is apparently suboptimal.  The present document
   proposes two localized routing mechanisms that are compatible with
   RFC 6705 for multi-access MNs which have some interfaces attached to
   the same MAGs.

1.  Introduction

   With the development of internet access technologies and mobile
   terminal equipment, more and more hosts are operating in multiple
   network interfaces, the situation that a terminal access to multiple
   heterogeneous network domains simultaneously has become more
   widespread.

   PMIPv6 is a protocol to provide IP mobility without MN participation.
   [RFC5213] proposes three kinds of Localized Routing schemes which
   allow MNs to route traffic by using localized forwarding or creating
   a direct tunnel between MAGs to improve routing and reduce the load
   of LMA.  Those three Localized Routing schemes are focus on Single-
   access scenario, as for Multiple-access scenario those schemes may be
   suboptimal.

   This document develops the mechanisms of RFC6705, and proposes two
   other localized routing mechanisms which are compatible with RFC 6705
   for multi-access MNs Attached to the same MAGs with some interfaces.
   The mentioned mechanisms optimize the traffic transport among the
   interfaces attached to the same MAG; consequently, reduce transport
   costs and traffic loads at the network side.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Scenario

   In this scenario, at least one of the two Mobile Nodes involved in
   communication has multiple interface access in PMIPv6 domain, and
   both of the two MNs have interfaces attached to the same MAG, as
   shown in Figure 1.  Both MN1 and MN2 access to PMIPv6 domain via two
   interfaces, both MN1-IF1 and MN2-IF1 are attached to MAG1.  We assume
   MN implements logical interface as defined
   in[I-D.ietf-netext-logical-interface-support], so that MN can adjust
   the uplink traffic sending interface according to the interface that
   the downlink traffic was received.

   the transport interfaces attached to the MAG that not connect with
   Correspondent nodes.  For example the traffic that is transported

   Identifier(MN-ID) of the transport interfaces attached to the MAG,
   and Both LRIs contain the IP address of the objective MAG (MAG1) that
   both MNs attached to.  As for the LRI sent to the objective MAG, it
   contains HNPs and MN-ID of the MNs involved.

   After receiving the LRI message, MAG verifies the attachment status
   of the MNs by checking the binding cache.  When MAG (MAG2 and MAG3)

   detects that the LRI contains MAG IP address option, it creates a
   local forwarding entry and forwards the session through a tunnel
   associated with the remote MAG.  When the MAG detects that the LRI
   contains no MAG IP address option but MN-ID option and a HNP
   option, it just updates the local route policy and forwards the
   session to the associated MNs.  For example MAG1 forwards the packets
   that its destination address Prefix contains MN1-HNP1 and MN1-HNP2 to
   MN1-IF1.  When the local process is over, MAG sends an LRA message
   for responding the LRI.  Then the packets sent from MN1 to MN2 will
   take the path of MN1-IF2->MAG2->MAG1-> MN2-IF1, and the packets sent
   from MN2 to MN1 will take the path of MN2-IF2->MAG3->MAG1-> MN1-IF1.

   As MN received a session on a sub-interface different from the one
   that the session had sent, it treats this event as a flow mobility
   trigger signal from the network.  Then MN updates the local router
   policy rules, so that the session's uplink was sent by the sub-
   interface that its downlink was received.  So the transport path
   between MN1 and MN2 is MN1-IF1<->MAG1<->MN2-IF1.

   Assumed that there is a session between MN1-IF2 and MN2-IF1, after
   LMA decision, LMA just creates an LRI message to the objective
   MAG(MAG1) that both of MNs attached to as illustrated in Figure 3.
   The Options that included in this LRI are the same as the ones
   included in the LRI sent to objective MAG in case1.

   When MAG1 receives the LRI, as in case1, MAG1 just updates the local
   route policy and forwards the packets to the associated MNs.  Then
   the transport path from MN1 to MN2 remains unchanged, but the path
   from MN2 to MN1 changes, it directly forwards packets to the MNs by
   MAG1 without Traversing the LMA.  It means that the transport from
   MN2 to MN will take the path of MN2-IF1->MAG1->MN1-IF1.

   As case1, when MN1 identified the downlink session arriving on the
   sub-interface is changed, it updates the local router policy rules,
   and then the packets sent from MN1 to MN2 will take the path of
   MN1-IF1->MAG1->MN2-IF1.
