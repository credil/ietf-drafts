Abstract

   To perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other metrics on
   a particular VPN flow, the egress PE need to tell to which specific
   ingress VRF a packet belongs.  But for L3VPN, multipoint-to-point or
   multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) network model applies, flow
   identifying is a big challenge.  This document summarizes the current
   performance monitoring mechanisms for MPLS networks, and analyzes the
   challenge for L3VPN performance monitoring.  This document also
   discuss the key points need to be taken in consideration when
   designing L3VPN performance monitoring mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   Level 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) [RFC4364]service is widely
   deployed in the production network.  It is deployed to provide
   enterprise interconnection, Voice over IP (VoIP), video, mobile, etc.
   services.  Most of these services are sensitive to the packet loss
   and delay.  The capability to measure and monitor performance metrics
   for packet loss, delay, as well as related metrics is essential for
   SLA.  The requirement for SLA measurement for MPLS networks has been
   documented in [RFC4377].

   One popular deployment of L3VPN nowadays is in mobile backhaul
   networks.  When deploying MPLS-TP in mobile backhaul network, due to
   the scalability issue with PW, L3VPN is used either for end-to-end
   service delivery, or L2VPN and L3VPN hybrid networking.  The
   measurement capability of L3VPN provides operators with greater
   visibility into the performance characteristics of their networks,
   and provides diagnostic information in case of performance
   degradation or failure and helps for fault localization.

   To perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other metrics on
   a particular VPN flow, the egress PE need to tell to which specific
   ingress VRF a packet belongs.  But for L3VPN, multipoint-to-point or
   multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) network model applies, flow
   identifying is a big challenge.  This document summarizes the current
   performance monitoring mechanisms for MPLS networks, and analyzes the
   challenge for L3VPN performance monitoring.  This document also
   discuss the key points need to be taken in consideration when
   designing L3VPN performance monitoring mechanisms.

2.  Overview of current mechanisms for MPLS networks

2.1.  Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks

   [RFC6374]defines procedure and protocol mechanisms to enable the
   efficient and accurate measurement of packet loss, delay, as well as
   related metrics in MPLS networks.

   The LM protocol can perform two distinct kinds of loss measurement.
   In inferred mode, it can measure the loss of specially generated test
   packets (in order to infer the approximate data-plane loss level).
   In direct mode, it can directly measure data-plane packet loss.
   Direct measurement provides perfect loss accounting, but may require
   specialized hardware support and is only applicable to some LSP
   types.  Inferred measurement provides only approximate loss
   accounting but is generally applicable.

   The LM and DM protocols are initiated from a single node, the
   querier.  A query message may be received either by a single node or
   by multiple nodes; i.e. these protocols provide point-to-point or
   point-to-multipoint measurement capabilities.

2.2.  Profile for MPLS-based Transport Networks

   Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput
   in MPLS networks are defined in [RFC6374].  [RFC6375]describes a
   profile, i.e. a simplified subset, of procedures that suffices to
   meet the specific requirements of MPLS-based transport networks
   [RFC5921] as defined in [RFC5860].  This profile is presented for the
   convenience of implementors who are concerned exclusively with the
   transport network context.

   LM session is externally configured and the values of several
   protocol parameters can be fixed in advance at the endpoints involved
   in the session, so that inspection or negotiation of these parameters
   is not required.

3.  Challenge for L3VPN Performance Monitoring

   To perform the measurement of packet loss, delay and other metrics on
   a particular VPN flow, the egress PE need to tell to which specific
   ingress VRF a packet belongs.

   The above mentioned existing mechanisms for MPLS networks provide
   either point-to-point or point-to-multipoint measurement
   capabilities.  For a specific receiver, it could easily identify a
   specific flow by the label stack information, when Penultimate Hop
   Pop (PHP) function is disabled .

   But in the case of L3VPN, multipoint-to-point or multipoint-to-
   multipoint (MP2MP) network model applies , it makes the flow
   identifying a big challenge for packets loss and delay measurement.
   According to the label allocation mechanisms of L3VPN, a private
   label itself cannot uniquely identify a specific VPN flow.  That is,
   when the egress PE allocates VPN label for a specific prefix of a
   VPN, the same label will be advertised to all its peers.  Given a VPN
   flow, the egress PE cannot tell which ingress VRF is from based on
   the private label it carries.  As a result, it's not feasible to
   perform the loss or delay measurement on this flow.

   In L3VPN the LSPs may be merged at any intermediate nodes along the
   LSP (e.g., Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] based LSP).
   The egress PE cannot derive a unique identifier of the source PE from
   label stack.  The tunnel label cannot help for flow identification
   due to the LSP merge.

   In L3VPN, the ingress PE could be identified by the tunnel label when
   TE LSP applies [RFC3209], but the egress PE cannot tell to which
   specific VRF a packet belongs when extranet (If the various sites in
   a VPN are owned by different enterprises) exist on ingress PE.
   Figure 1 shows an example of extranet.  In Figure1, Site A,B,C,D all
   belong to the same VPN-A, but Site C and Site D does not belong to
   the same enterprise (Site D also belongs to a VPN-B), so different
   VRFs are maintained for each site on PE3.  PE1 assign the same label
   L for prefix 10.0.0.1 to PE3 of VPN-A, when it recieve the VPN-A flow
   from PE3, it can not tell the flow is from either VRFC or VRFD by the
   label stack.

   The current label allocation mechanism of L3VPN make the flow
   identification a big challenge for L3VPN performace monitoring, as a
   result the current performace monitoring mechanisms for MPLS networks
   cannot be applied to L3VPN networks.  Extension or alteration to
   current label allocation mechanism is needed to solve the problem.

4.  Design Consideration

   This section discuss the key points need to be taken in consideration
   when designing L3VPN performance monitoring mechanism.

4.1.  P2P Connection

   As analyzed above, to perform the packet loss or delay measurement on
   a specific VPN flow, it is critical for the egress PE to identify the
   unique ingress VRF, i.e. to establish the Point-to-Point connection
   between the two VRFs.  Current allocation mechanism may need
   extension or alteration to help build up the Point-to-Point
   connection.  Once the Point-to-Point connection is built up, current
   measurement mechanisms may be applied to L3VPN .

   Conditions like Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP), Equal-Cost Multi-Path
   (ECMP) load-balancing and BGP multi-path may make it infeasible for
   receiving PE to identify the ingress PE.  These conditions SHOULD be
   excluded for consideration for mechanism design.

4.2.  Control Plane

   In L3VPN, BGP is used to distribute a particular route, as well as an
   MPLS label that is mapped to that route [RFC4364].  The label mapping
   information for a particular route is piggybacked in the same BGP
   Update message that is used to distribute the route itself.  In order
   to setup the Point-to-Point connection between ingress and egress
   VRFs the current label distribution mechanism may be altered.  For
   compatibility, this alteration SHOULD NOT change the current label
   distribution mechanism dramatically.

4.3.  Data Plane

   Same as for control plane, for compatibility reason, the data plane
   should as far as be compatible with the current L3VPN forwarding
   procedure.

4.4.  MPLS OAM

   [RFC6374], [RFC6375]defines procedure and protocol mechanisms to
   enable the measurement of packet loss, delay, as well as related
   metrics in MPLS networks.  These mechanisms SHOULD be reasonably
   reused in L3VPN networks.  The addressing of source an destination of
   Loss Measurement (LM) and Delay Measurement (DM) messages may needed
   to be changed to identify the measured VRF.

Internet-Draft            PM Analysis for L3VPN             October 2012


4.5.  QoS

   To perform the packet loss or delay measurement in L3VPN network,
   either proactive or on-demand, SHOULD NOT impact the customer QoS
   experience.

4.6.  Configuration

   Measurement entities and functions MUST be configurable either
   statically or dynamically.  It SHOULD be possible to configure and
   activated/deactivated the measurement capability as part of
   connectivity establishment, and it SHOULD also be possible to
   configure and activated/deactivated the capability after connectivity
   has been established .
