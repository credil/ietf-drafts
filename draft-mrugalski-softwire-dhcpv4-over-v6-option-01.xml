      defines a way for communication between legacy DHCPv4 clients
      with DHCPv4 servers over IPv6-only transport. It requires
      deployment of Client Relay Agent (CRA) that transmits messages
      to IPv6-Transport Server (TSV) or IPv6-Transport Relay Agent
      (TRA). Deployed CRA must know an address of TSV or TRA to
      forward incoming client's messages. This document defines a
      DHCPv6 option that may be used to provision TSV or TRA location
      to CRAs.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6"/> defines a way
      for communication between legacy DHCPv4 clients with DHCPv4
      servers (defined in <xref target="RFC2131"/>) over IPv6-only
      transport. It requires deployment of Client Relay Agent (CRA)
      that transmits messages to IPv6-Transport Server (TSV) or
      IPv6-Transport Relay Agent (TRA). Although there are several
      scenarios envisaged, all of them assume that CRA needs to know
      the recipient address of the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 traffic. In a
      typical deployment as
      <xref target="I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite"/>
      or <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6"/>,
      CRA functionality will be a part of a Lightweight B4 element 
      (Basic Bridging BroadBand element) implementation.</t>

      <t>Depending on the scenario discussed, the DHCPv4 over IPv6
      transport endpoint could be either an IPv6-Transport Server (TSV)
      or an IPv6-Transport Relay Agent (TRA). Both cases are
      indistinguishable from CRA perspective. CRA needs to know TSV's
      or TRA's IPv6 address in advance to relay traffic. Again, the
      typical envisaged use would be the Lightweight 4over6
      architecture, where TSV or TRA could be part of Lightweight
      AFTR implementation.</t>

      <t>As CRA uplink is IPv6-only (otherwise there would be no need
      to deploy DHCPv4 over IPv6), the only feasible way to provision
      information to CRA is over DHCPv6. Therefore this document specifies
      a DHCPv6 option that conveys necessary information.</t>

      <t>To provide the conveyance of the configuration information, a
      single <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> option is used,
      expressing the TRA's or TSV's IPv6 address to the CRA.</t>

    </section>

    <section title='The DHCPv4-Over-IPv6 Endpoint DHCPv6 Option' anchor='option-addr'>
      <t>The DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option is a DHCPv6 option. It consists
      of an option-code and option-len fields (as all DHCPv6 options
      have), and a fixed-length dhcpv4-over-ipv6-endpoint-addr
      field containing an IPv6 address that refers to
      the DHCPv4 over IPv6 transport endpoint to which the CRA MAY
      transport DHCPv4 traffic. This address represents TRA or TSV,
      depending on deployment scenario.</t>

      <t>The DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option SHOULD NOT appear in any other
      than the following DHCPv6 messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request,
      Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and Reply.</t>

      <t>The format of the DHCPv4 over IPv6 option is shown in the
      following figure:</t>

      <t>The option is validated by confirming that all of the
      following conditions are met:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>the option-len is exactly 16;</t>
        <t>the dhcpv4-over-ipv6-endpoint-addr contains valid unicast address.
	In particular any address (::), multicast (ff::/8) or IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
        is invalid and MUST be rejected.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>A DHCPv6 server SHOULD NOT send more than one DHCPv4-over-IPv6
      option.  It SHOULD NOT permit the configuration of multiple
      addresses within one DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option.  Both of these
      conditions are handled as errors by the client, so an
      operator using software that does not perform these validations
      should be careful not to configure multiple addresses.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2</xref>
      describes how a DHCPv6 client and server negotiate configuration
      values using the Option Request Option (OPTION_ORO).  As a
      convenience to the reader, we mention here that a server will
      not reply with a DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option if the client has not
      explicitly enumerated it on its Option Request Option. In other
      words, server SHOULD send this option only if client explicitly
      requested it in ORO.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>A client that supports the DHCPv4 over IPv6 functionality of
      and conforms to this specification MUST include OPTION_DHCP4_OVER_V6
      on its OPTION_ORO.</t>

      <t>If the client receives the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option, it MUST verify the
        option contents as described in <xref target="option-addr"/>.</t>

      <t>If the CRA entity receives more than one DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option, it
        MUST use only one instance of that option.</t>

      <t>If the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option contains more than one address,
      the CRA entity system MUST ignore the option. It SHOULD
      warn its operator about such condition.</t>

      <t>Note that a CRA system may have multiple network interfaces,
      and these interfaces may be configured differently; some may be
      connected to networks that call for DHCPv4-over-IPv6, and some
      may be connected to networks that are using normal dual stack or
      other means.  The CRA entity should approach this specification
      on an interface-by-interface basis.  For example, if the CRA
      entity is attached to multiple networks that provide the
      DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option, then the CRA entity MUST configure a
      DHCPv4 over IPv6 transport for each interface separately as each
      transport provides IPv4 connectivity for each distinct
      interface.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document does not present any new security issues, but
      as with all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely
      possible that the configuration is being delivered by a third
      party (Man In The Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust
      that the access the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 connection provides can be
      trusted. It should be protected by available security mechanisms
      such as IP firewalls.</t>

      <t>It should be noted that DHCPv4 over IPv6 traffic may bypass
      existing firewalls that are typically configured to drop
      incoming outside DHCPv4 over IPv4 and DHCPv6 over IPv6 traffic.</t>

      security issues.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is kindly requested to allocate DHCPv6 option code TBD
      to the OPTION_DHCP4_OVER_V6. The value should be added to the
      DHCPv6 option code space defined in Section 24.3 of <xref
      target="RFC3315"/>.</t>
