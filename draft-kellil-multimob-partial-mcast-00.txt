Abstract

   Various approaches have been proposed to support multicast in PMIPv6
   domains. However, the problem of partial deployment of multicast in
   the PMIPv6 domain has not been considered. In particular, the
   proposed approaches typically assume that all the MAGs of the PMIPv6
   domain are multicast-capable. The present work aims at carrying out
   the case where some of the PMIPv6 domain's MAGs are not necessarily
   multicast-capable.

Internet-Draft    Group Communications in PMIPv6        November 2012


 1. Introduction

   The present work seeks into addressing the case of partial
   deployment of multicast in PMIPv6 domains while enabling end-to-end
   group communications.

   The proposed approach may be useful for network operators that may
   be reluctant in deploying multicast in the whole PMIPv6 domain for
   different reasons like deployment cost, security policy/access
   control constraints, service provisioning constraints, QoS, etc. For
   such operators, the present approach may represent a good short/mid-
   term multicast deployment strategy in PMIPv6 (for an experimental
   purpose, for instance).

   Various approaches have been proposed to support multicast in PMIPv6
   domains. They all assume that multicast is supported in the whole
   PMIPv6 domain. For instance, the document [RFC 6224] describes some
   techniques for deploying multicast listener functions in Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domains without modifying mobility and multicast
   protocol standards. In the proposed solution, the LMA implements the
   function of the designated multicast router, MLD querier, and
   optionally an MLD proxy. According to MLD reports received from a
   MAG (on behalf of the MNs), the LMA manages multicast forwarding
   states at its corresponding downstream tunnel interfaces. Also, the
   MAG performs MLD proxy functions. A MAG that does not support
   multicast operations will discard MN's subscription message. This
   solution does not address the case of a partial deployment of
   multicast in the PMIPv6 domain (e.g., scenarios where some MAGs of
   the PMIPv6 domain do not support multicast operations). Also, other
   approaches like [Saada2012] [Hui2012] seek into optimizing mobility
   of multicast receivers in terms of handover latency and tunneling
   overhead at the MAG, yet such approaches do not solve the problem of
   partial deployment of multicast in the PMIPv6 domain.


 2. Proposed Solution

2.1. Assumptions

   The solution leverages SIP protocol [RFC 3261] to enable the LMA
   storing information about active multicast groups. Therefore, it is
   assumed that a SIP framework is deployed over the PMIPv6 domain. In
   this framework the LMA plays the role of a SIP proxy. This proxy is
   of a stateful type so as it can maintain states of active multicast
   groups and associated MNs. Also, the SIP server is present in the
   SIP framework, yet the SIP server will not be discussed in this
   document because it is not directly involved in the functional

   scheme of the present approach. In addition, the MN is assumed to
   perform standard PMIPv6 operations for network attachment and
   handover [RFC 5213].

   Also, the MN is assumed to be a multicast-capable node (multicast
   receiver) as well as a SIP client. However, the MN is not aware of
   any possible multicast capability on the MAG. This avoids the
   modification of Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC 4861].

   Also, the LMA is assumed to be a multicast anchor point in that it
   implements the operations defined in RFC 6224 (MLD Querier, optional
   MLD proxy, and multicast router). The LMA also manages a multicast
   subscription list (MSL) that has the following structure:

   <mcast @>,  <MN-ID>, <MN @>, <MAG @>, <MAG cap>

   There may be multiple MAGs in the PMIPv6 domain. Some of these MAGs
   are multicast-capable whereas others are standard PMIPv6 MAGs. Also,
   some of these standard PMIPv6 MAGs may be configured with a mapping
   that associates a UDP port number to one or more multicast
   addresses. In view of that, three types of MAG are to be considered:
   non multicast capable MAG, configurable MAG, and multicast-capable
   MAG.

   o Non multicast capable MAG (NM): in this option the MAG supports
      conventional PMIPv6 operations only, as per RFC 5213.

   o Configurable MAG (CM): a MAG that supports conventional PMIPv6
      operations and stores a structure that maps an input UDP port
      number to a multicast address. In addition, it is capable of
      forwarding multicast packets to the MNs attached to its network.
      The MAG's input UDP port number is known in advance by both the
      MAG and LMA.

   o Multicast capable MAG (MM): a MAG that supports multicast
      operations as indicated in RFC 6224.

   Also, in this solution it is assumed that the LMA knows the
   capability of each MAG in terms of multicast support. Also, it is
   assumed that each time the LMA receives a PBU message from a MAG, it
   internally checks for MAG's capability.

   To store the information on the MAG capability in terms of multicast
   support, the standard PMIPv6 binding cache structure may need to be
   modified so as each MAG address will be associated (e.g., will be
   pointing) to a MAG capability value NM, CM, or MM.

2.2. Node Subscription

   First, the MN attaches to the PMIPv6 network using the standard
   procedure defined in RFC 5213 (cf. figure 1). Once the MN has
   configured its IP address, it initiates the group subscription
   procedure, by sending a SIP invite message to the LMA, which acts as
   a SIP proxy. The SIP invite message includes the multicast address of
   the desired group as well as the MN-ID.
   When the LMA receives the SIP invite message from MN, it stores the
   MN-ID and multicast address in its multicast subscription list (MSL).

   It is worth mentioning that since the LMA holds the couple "<MN-ID>,
   <MAG @>" in its binding cache as well, the present solution proposes
   that each time the LMA notices that a new MN has registered through a
   standard PMIPv6 procedure, it checks whether this MN is registered in
   the MSL list. If so, the LMA then checks if the said MSL entry
   includes the MN's MAG address.  If the MAG address does not exist,
   the LMA will add it in the MSL entry. If MN's MAG address is already
   in the MSL list, no further operation is needed in the MSL entry.

   In addition to its registration with the LMA, the MN sends an
   (unsolicited) MLD Report message on its link, without caring, though,
   whether the MAG is multicast-capable or not. These options are
   discussed in what follows.

2.2.1. Option 1 - Non multicast-capable MAG

   When the LMA receives a PBU message from a MAG and notices that the
   said MAG is not multicast-capable, it checks whether the MN-ID
   included in the PBU message is registered in one of the entries of
   its multicast subscription list (MSL). If so, the LMA updates the
   associated MSL entry with the MAG's IP address, and attaches to the
   multicast tree on behalf of the MN (cf. figure 2). In addition, the
   LMA establishes a double IP tunneling towards the MN (besides the
   LMA's standard PMIPv6 tunnel). The inner tunnel will end at the MN's
   IP address, and the outer tunnel will end at MAG's IP address. Of
   course, this double IP tunneling is transparent to the MAG, since the
   inner header includes MN's IP address, while the outer tunnel
   (obviously) terminates at the MAG's PMIPv6 tunnel interface.

   If the MN-ID is not in the MSL list, no multicast-specific operation
   is needed on the LMA. On the other hand, when the MAG receives MN's
   Report, it will ignore it.

2.2.2. Option 2 - Configurable MAG

   When the LMA receives a PBU message from a MAG and notices that the
   said MAG is a configurable MAG, it checks whether the MN-ID included
   in the PBU message is registered in one of the entries of its
   multicast subscription list (MSL). If so, the LMA updates the
   associated MSL entry with the MAG's IP address, and attaches to the
   multicast tree on behalf of the MN (cf. figure 3). In addition, the
   LMA establishes a unicast tunnel towards the MAG (besides the
   standard PMIPv6 tunnel) and sets a dedicated destination port number
   to the said tunnel. In a preferred setting, there is a common tunnel
   (and thus a common port number) between LMA and MAG for all the
   multicast addresses. The use of one tunnel (and thus one port
   number) between LMA and MAG per multicast address is kept optional.

   If the MN-ID is not in the MSL list, no multicast-specific operation
   is needed on the LMA. On the other hand, when the MAG receives MN's
   MLD Report, it will ignore it.

         Figure 2 PMIPv6-based MN's Group Join Procedure - Case of
                             Configurable MAG

2.2.3. Option 3 - Multicast-capable MAG

   When the LMA receives a PBU message from a MAG and notices that the
   said MAG is multicast-capable, it checks whether the MN-ID included
   in the PBU message is registered in one of the entries of its
   multicast subscription list (MSL). If so, the LMA updates the
   associated MSL entry with the MAG' IP address, and carries on the
   rest of the MN registration operation according to RFC 6224 (i.e.,
   receive and process aggregated MLD Reports (or Aggregated Join
   message) from the MAG, attach to the multicast tree on behalf of the
   MN, establish appropriate tunnel with the MAG).

   If the MN-ID is not in the MSL list, no multicast-specific operation
   is needed on the LMA. On the other hand, when the MAG receives MN's
   MLD Report, it will process it according to RFC 6224 specification
   (MLD Reports aggregation and forwarding to LMA).

2.3. Data Forwarding

   When the LMA receives a multicast packet, it checks its MSL list for
   the entries that match the packet's multicast address. For each
   matching entry, the LMA checks whether the associated MAG is
   multicast-capable or not.

2.3.1. Option 1 - Non multicast-capable MAG

   If the MAG is not multicast-capable, the LMA will utilize a double-
   tunneling to send the multicast packet towards the MN. The outer IP
   header of the tunnel includes MAG's address as a destination. The
   inner IP header of the tunnel includes MN's IP address so as
   multicast packet forwarding from LMA to MN via the MAG will be
   transparent to the said MAG.

   When the MAG receives the multicast packet from the LMA via its
   PMIPv6 tunnel interface, it removes the outer header and forwards the
   resulting packet to the MN (as per RFC 5213).

2.3.2. Option 2 - Configurable MAG

   If the MAG is configurable, the LMA will tunnel the multicast packet
   towards the MAG using the dedicated UDP port number.

   When the MAG receives the multicast packet from the LMA via a
   dedicated input UDP port, it removes the outer header and forwards
   the resulting (multicast) packet on its downstream interface.

2.3.3. Option 3 - Multicast Capable MAG

   Data forwarding procedure in option 3 is similar to that of RFC
   6224.

2.4. Node Handover

   MN handover to a new network associated to a new MAG: nMAG is quite
   similar to that of the MN subscription phase (option 1, option 2 &
   option 3), excluding the SIP procedure, which of course is not
   needed for the handover phase. In addition, the LMA in the MN
   handover phase has to update the associated MSL entry with the nMAG'
   IP address (this update is done when the LMA checks the PBU's MN-ID
   in the MSL list). Furthermore, in the handover phase there may be no
   need to (re)build the multicast path (from the multicast tree)
   towards the LMA (since the said path is (normally) already built).

2.5. Node Unsubscription

   When an MN wishes to leave a multicast group, it notifies the LMA
   via SIP Bye message and sends an MLD Exclude/Done on its link. The
   SIP message contains the multicast address of the group to be left
   by MN as well as the MN-ID.

   When the LMA receives the SIP Bye message, it checks MN's ID and the
   multicast address against the MSL entries. If an entry is found, the
   LMA removes it and updates the multicast routing state accordingly
   (ex. the LMA removes the multicast forwarding state for the said
   multicast address if no more MNs are associated to this multicast
   address).

   On the MAG's side, however, three options are to be distinguished.

2.5.1. Option 1 - Non multicast-capable MAG

   When a non-multicast capable MAG receives an MLD Exclude/Done
   message, it ignores it.

2.5.2. Option 2 - Configurable MAG

   When a configurable MAG receives an MLD Exclude/Done message, it
   ignores it.

2.5.3. Option 3 - Multicast-Capable MAG

   When a multicast-capable MAG receives an MLD Exclude/Done message,
   the rest of the procedure follows RFC 6224's operations (if
   necessary, update of the MAG's membership database and transmission
   of MLD Exclude/Done via the MAG-to-LMA interface towards the LMA,
   which then terminates multicast forwarding).

 3. Security Considerations

   The security considerations are the same as that covered by [RFC
   6224] and [RFC 3261].

 4. IANA Considerations

   If this solution is to be pursued, IANA would be kindly requested to
   reserve a default port to be used in the case of configurable MAG.
