	<!-- The goal of this document is to
	describe key  aspects of multi-hop ad hoc wireless communication. -->
	Experience gathered with ad hoc routing protocol development, deployment and operation,
	shows that wireless communication presents specific challenges <xref target="RFC2501"/>
	<xref target="DoD01"/>,
	which Internet protocol designers should be aware of, when designing
	solutions for ad hoc networks at the IP layer. 
	This document briefly describes these challenges. 
</t>

<section anchor='manets' title='Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Networks'>

<t>
	For the purposes of this document, a multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	network will be considered to be a collection of devices
	that each have a radio transceiver, that are using the same
	physical and medium access protocols, that are moreover configured
	to self-organize and provide store-and-forward functionality
	on top of these protocols as needed to enable communications.
	The devices providing network connectivity are considered to
	be routers. Other non-routing wireless devices, if present
	in the ad hoc network, are considered to be "end-hosts".
	The considerations in this document apply equally to routers
	or end-hosts; we use the term "node" to refer to any such
	network device in the ad hoc network.
</t>

<t>
	Examples of multi-hop ad hoc wireless network deployment and operation
	include wireless community networks such as
	Funkfeuer<xref target="FUNKFEUER"/> 
	and Freifunk<xref target="FREIFUNK"/>; these use routers
	running OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing <xref target="RFC3626"/>)
	on IEEE 802.11 in ad hoc mode with the same ESSID (Extended Service
	Set Identification) at the link layer. Multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	networks may also run on link layers other than 802.11, and may
	use routing protocols other than OLSR (for instance,
	AODV<xref target="RFC3561"/>, TBRPF<xref target="RFC3684"/>,
	DSR<xref target="RFC4728"/>, or OSPF-MPR<xref target="RFC5449"/>).
</t>

<t>
	In contrast, simple hosts communicating through an 802.11 access
	point in infrastructure mode do not form a multi-hop
	ad hoc wireless network, since the central role of the access point
	is predetermined, and since nodes other than the access point
	do not generally provide store-and-forward functionality.
</t>

	title="Common Packet Transmission Characteristics in
		Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Networks">
	
<t>	
	Let A and B be two nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network N. 
	Suppose that, when node A transmits a packet through its 
	interface on network N, that packet is correctly received
	by node B without requiring storage and/or forwarding by any other
	device. We will then say that B can "detect" packets transmitted by
	A, or more simply that B detects A.  Note that therefore, when B
	detects an IP packet transmitted by A, the TTL of
	the IP packet detected by B will be precisely the same as it
	was when A transmitted that packet.
</t>

<t>
	Let S be the set of nodes that can detect packets transmitted 
	by node A through its interface on network N. The following
	section gathers common characteristics concerning packet
	transmission over such networks, which were observed through
	experience with MANET routing protocol development 
	(OLSR<xref target="RFC3626"/>, AODV<xref target="RFC3561"/>, 
	TBRPF<xref target="RFC3684"/>, DSR<xref target="RFC4728"/>, 
	or OSPF-MPR<xref target="RFC5449"/>), as well as deployment and
	operation (Freifunk<xref target="FREIFUNK"/>,
	Funkfeuer<xref target="FUNKFEUER"/>).
</t>


<section anchor="graphs"
	title="Asymmetry, Time-Variation, and Non-Transitivity">

<t>
	First, even though a node C in set S can (by definition) detect packets
	transmitted by node A, there is no guarantee that node C can,
	conversely, send IP packets directly to node A. In other
	words, even though C can detect packets transmitted by A (since it is
	a member of set S), there is no guarantee that A can detect
	packets transmitted by C. Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	communications may be "asymmetric".  Such cases are common.
</t>


<t>
	Second, there is no guarantee that, as a set, S is at all stable, i.e.
	the membership of set S may in fact change at any rate, at any time.
	Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications may be "time-variant".
	Time variation is often observed in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks
	due to variability of the wireless medium, and to node mobility.
</t>

<t>
	Now, conversely, let V be the set of nodes which A detects --
	in other words, IP packets transmitted by any node in set V are
	received directly by A, without TTL decrement. Suppose that node A is
	communicating at time t0 through its interface on network N.
	As a consequence of time variation and asymmetry,
	we observe that A:
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">

<t>
	cannot assume that S = V,
</t>

<t>
	cannot assume that S and/or V are unchanged at time t1 later than t0.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
	Furthermore, transitivity is not guaranteed over multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless networks. Indeed, let's assume that, through their
	respective interfaces within network N:
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">

<t>
	node B and node A can detect one another (i.e. node B is a member of
	sets S and V), and,
</t>

<t>
	node A and node C can also detect one another (i.e. node C is a
	also a member of sets S and V).
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>	
	These assumptions do not imply that node B can detect node C, nor that
	node C can detect node B (through their interface on network N).
	Such "non-transitivity" is common on multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless networks.
</t>

<t>
	In a nutshell: multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications can be
	asymmetric, non-transitive, and time-varying. 
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="reality"
	title="Radio Range and Wireless Irregularities">

<t>
	<xref target="graphs"/> presents an abstract description of some
	common characteristics concerning packet transmission over multi-hop
	ad hoc wireless networks.  This section describes practical examples,
	which illustrate the characteristics listed in <xref target="graphs"/>
	as well as other common effects.
</t>

<t>
	Wireless communication links are subject to limitations to the
	distance across which they may be established. The range-limitation
	factor creates specific problems on multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	networks. In this context, the radio ranges of several nodes
	often partially overlap. Such partial overlap causes
	communication to be non-transitive and/or asymmetric, as described
	in <xref target="graphs"/>.  Moreover, the range varies from one
	node to another, depending on location and environmental factors.
	This is in addition to the time variation of range and signal
	strength caused by variability in the local environment.
</t>	

<t>
	For example, as depicted in Figure 1, it may happen that a node
	B detects a node A which transmits at high power, whereas B transmits
	at lower power. In such cases, B detects A, but A cannot detect B.
	This examplifies the asymmetry in multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	communications as defined in <xref target="graphs"/>.
</t>

</t>	

<t>	
	Another example, depicted in Figure 2, is known as the "hidden node"
	problem.  Even though the nodes all have equal power for their radio
	transmissions, they cannot all detect one another.  In the figure,
	nodes A and B can detect one another, and A and C can also detect one another. 
	On the other hand, nodes B and C cannot detect one another.  When
	nodes B and C try to communicate with node A simultaneously, their
	radio signals collide.  Node A will only be able to detect noise, and
	may even be unable to determine the source of the noise.  The hidden
	terminal problem illustrates the property of non-transitivity in
	multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications as described
	in <xref target="graphs"/>.

</t>	


<t><vspace blankLines="6"/></t>

<t>
	Another situation, shown in Figure 3, is known as the
	"exposed node" problem. In the figure, node A is transmitting
	(to node B). As shown, node C cannot reliably communicate with
	node D, because of the on-going transmission of node A, presenting
	interference within
	C's radio-range.  Node C cannot detect D, but node D can
	detect C because D is outside A's radio range.
	Node C is then called an "exposed node", because it is exposed to
	co-channel interference from node A and thereby prevented from
	exchanging protocol messages to enable data transmission to node D
	-- even though the transmission would be successful and would not
	interfere with the reception of data sent from node A to node B.

</t>

<t>
	Hidden and exposed node situations are often observed
	in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks. Problems with asymmetric
	links may also arise for reasons other than power inequality
	(e.g., multipath interference).
	Such problems are often resolved by specific mechanisms below the
	IP layer.
	However, depending on the link layer technology in use and the
	position of the nodes, such problems due to
	range-limitation and partial overlap may affect the IP layer.
</t>

<t>
	Besides radio range limitations, wireless communications are
	affected by irregularities in the shape of the geographical area
	over which nodes may effectively communicate (see for instance
	<xref target="MC03"/>, <xref target="MI03"/>).
	For example, even omnidirectional wireless transmission is
	typically non-isotropic (i.e. non-circular).
	Signal strength often suffers frequent and significant variations,
	which are not a simple function of distance.  Instead, it is a
	complex function of the environment including obstacles, weather
	conditions, interference, and other factors that change over time.
	Because each individual link has to encounter different terrain,
	path, obstructions, atmospheric conditions and other phenomena,
	analytical formulation of signal strength is considered intractable
	<xref target="VTC99"/>, and the radio engineering community has thus
	developed numerous radio propagation models, relying on median values
	observed in specific environments <xref target="SAR03"/>.
</t>

<t>
	The above irregularities also cause communications on multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless networks to be non-transitive, asymmetric, or time-varying,
	as described in <xref target="graphs"/>, and may impact protocols at
	the IP layer and above.  There may be no indication to IP when a
	previously established communication channel becomes unusable;
	"link down" triggers are generally absent in multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	networks, since the absence of detectable radio energy (e.g., in
	carrier waves) may simply indicate that neighboring nodes are not
	currently transmitting.  Such an absence of detectable radio energy
	does not therefore indicate whether or not transmissions have failed
	to reach the intended destination.
</t>

</section>
</section>

<section anchor="moreterms" title="Alternative Terminology">

<t>
	Many terms have been used in the past to describe the relationship of 
	nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network based on their ability
	to send or receive packets to/from each other.  The terms used in
	this document have been selected because the authors believe they are
	unambiguous, with respect to the
	goal of this document (see <xref target="introduction"/>).
</t>	
<t>
	Nevertheless, here are a few other terms that describe the same
	relationship between nodes in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.
	In the following, let network N be, again, a multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless network.  Let the set S be, as before, the set of 
	nodes that can directly receive packets transmitted by node A
	through its interface on network N. In other words, any node B
	belonging to S can detect packets transmitted by A. Then,
	due to the asymmetry characteristic of wireless links:
</t>


<t>
<list style="hanging">

<t>
	- We may say that node B hears node A. In this
	terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is hears
	node B, even if node B hears node A.
</t>

<t>
	- We may say that node B is reachable from node A. In this
	terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is reachable from
	node B, even if node B is reachable from node A.
</t>

<t>
	- We may say that node A has a link to node B. In this terminology,
	there is no guarantee that node B has a link to node A, even if
	node A has a link to node B.
</t>

<t>
	- We may say that node B is adjacent to node A. In this terminology,
	there is no guarantee that node A is adjacent to node B, even
	if node B is adjacent to node A.
</t>


<t>
	- We may say that node B is downstream from node A. In this
	terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is downstream from
	node B, even if node B is downstream from node A.
</t>

<t>
	- We may say that node B is a neighbor of node A. In this
	terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is a neighbor
	of node B, even if node B a neighbor of node A.  As it happens,
	the terminology for "neighborhood" is quite confusing for
	asymmetric links.  When B can detect signals from A, but A
	cannot detect B, it is not clear whether B should be considered
	a neighbor of A at all, since A would not necessarily be
	aware that B was a neighbor.  Perhaps it is best to avoid
	the "neighbor" terminology except for symmetric links.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
	This list of alternative terminologies is given here for illustrative
	purposes only, and is not suggested to be complete or even
	representative of the breadth of terminologies that have been
	used in various ways to explain the properties mentioned in
	<xref target="links"/>.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="IPover" title="IP over Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless">

<t>
	The characteristics of packet transmission over multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless networks, described in previous sections, are not the
	typical characteristics expected by IP <xref target="RFC6250"/>.
	Nevertheless, it is possible and desirable to run IP over such
	networks, through the use of:
</t>
<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t>
	IP interface configuration, such as described in
	RFC 5889 <xref target="RFC5889"/>, or
</t>

<t>
	routing protocols designed for operation over wireless interfaces,
	for example OLSR<xref target="RFC3626"/>, AODV<xref target="RFC3561"/>,
	or OSPF-MPR<xref target="RFC5449"/>.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Thus, even though the physical effects described in this document require
robust protocol designs for routing and topology management, the experience
in the projects described in the cited references shows that useful networks
can be designed and operated using well-understood techniques.
Protocols running above the IP layer can be shielded somewhat from
the unusual characteristics experienced over multi-hop ad hoc wireless
networks. Note however that some protocols are nevertheless more appropriate
than others when interfaces to multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks are
involved in the communication. For instance, for applications written
to run over both UDP and TCP, the latter choice may be preferred in
situations with relatively high packet loss rates. But such choices
must be based on application requirements.
