                       draft-ietf-rtgwg-mofrr-01

Abstract

   As IPTV deployments grow in number and size, service providers are
   looking for solutions that minimize the service disruption due to
   faults in the IP network carrying the packets for these services.
   This draft describes a mechanism for minimizing packet loss in a
   network when node or link failures occur.  Multicast only Fast Re-
   Route (MoFRR) works by making simple enhancements to multicast
   routing protocols such as PIM and mLDP.

Internet-Draft                    MoFRR                       April 2013


1.  Introduction

   Multiple techniques have been developed and deployed to improve
   service guarantees, both for multicast video traffic and Video on
   Demand traffic.  Most existing solutions are geared towards finding
   an alternate path around one or more failed network elements (link,
   node, path failures).

   This draft describes a mechanism for minimizing packet loss in a
   network when node or link failures occur.  Multicast only Fast Re-
   Route (MoFRR) works by making simple changes to the way selected
   routers use multicast protocols such as PIM and mLDP.  No changes to
   the protocols themselves are required.  With MoFRR, in many cases,
   multicast routing protocols don't necessarily have to depend on or
   have to wait on unicast routing protocols to detect network failures.

   On a merge point MoFRR logic determines a primary Upstream Multicast
   Hop (UMH) and a secondary UMH and joins the tree via both
   simultaneously.  Data packets are received over the primary and
   secondary paths.  Only the packets from the primary UMH are accepted
   and forwarded down the tree, the packets from the secondary UMH are
   discarded.  The UMH determination is different for PIM and mLDP and
   explained later in this document.  When a failure is detected on the
   path to the primary UMH, the repair occurs by changing the secondary
   UMH into the primary and the primary into the secondary.  Since the
   repair is local, it is fast - greatly improving convergence times in
   the event of node or link failures on the path to the primary UMH.

   tree :  Either a PIM (S,G)/(*,G) tree or a mLDP P2MP or MP2MP LSP.

   OIF :  Outgoing InterFace, an interface used to forward multicast
      packets down the tree towards the receivers.  Either a PIM
      (S,G)/(*,G) tree or a mLDP P2MP or MP2MP LSP.


2.  Basic Overview

   The basic idea of MoFRR is for a merge point router to join a
   multicast tree via two divergent upstream paths in order to get
   maximum redundancy.  The two divergent paths SHOULD never merge
   upstream, otherwise the maximal redundancy is compromised.  Sometimes
   the topology guarantees maximal redundancy, other times additional
   configuration or techniques are needed to enforce it.  See later in
   this document.

   A merge point router should only accept and forward on one of the
   upstream paths at the time in order to avoid duplicate packet
   forwarding.  The selection of the primary and secondary UMH is done
   by the MoFRR logic and normally based on unicast routing to find loop
   free candidates.

   Note, the impact of additional amount of data on the network is
   mitigated when tree membership is densely populated.  When a part of
   the network has redundant data flowing, join latency for new joining
   members is reduced because its likely a tree merge point is not far
   away.


3.  Upstream Multicast Hop Selection

   An Upstream Multicast Hop (UMH) is a candidate next-hop that can be
   used to reach the root of the tree.  This is normally based on
   unicast routing to find loop free candidate(s).  With MoFRR
   procedures we select a primary and a backup UMH.  The procedures for
   determining the UMH are different for PIM and mLDP.  See below;

3.1.  PIM

   The UMH selection in PIM is also known as the Reverse Path Forwarding
   (RPF) procedure.  Based on a unicast route lookup on either the
   Source address or Rendezvous Point (RP) [RFC4601], an upstream
   interface is selected for sending the PIM Joins/Prunes AND accepting
   the multicast packets.  The interface the packets are received on is
   used to pass or fail the RPF check.  If packets are received on an
   interface that was not selected by the RPF procedure, or not the
   primary, the packets are discarded.

3.2.  mLDP

   The UMH selection in mLDP also depends on unicast routing, but the
   difference with PIM is that the acceptance of multicast packets is
   based on MPLS labels and independent on the interface the packet is
   received on.  Using the procedures as defined in [RFC6388] an
   upstream Label Switched Router (LSR) is elected.  The upstream LSR
   that was elected for a Label Switched Path (LSP) gets a unique local
   MPLS Label allocated.  Multicast packets are only forwarded if the
   MPLS label matches the MPLS label that was allocated for that LSPs
   (primary) upstream LSR.


4.  Topologies for MoFRR

   MoFRR works best in topologies illustrated in the figure below.
   MoFRR may be enabled on any router in the network.  In the figures
   below, MoFRR is shown enabled on the Provider Edge (PE) routers to
   illustrate one way in which the technology may be deployed.

         FIG1. Two-Plane Network Design


   The topology has two planes, a primary plane and a secondary plane
   that are fully disjoint from each other all the way into the POPs.
   This two plane design is common in service provider networks as it
   eliminates single point of failures in their core network.  The links
   marked PJ indicate the normal path of how the PIM joins flow from the
   POPs towards the source of the network.  Multicast streams,
   especially for the densely watched channels, typically flow along
   both the planes in the network anyways.

   The only change MoFRR adds to this is on the links marked S where the
   PE routers join a secondary path to their secondary ECMP UMH.  As a
   result of this, each PE router receives two copies of the same
   stream, one from the primary plane and the other from the secondary
   plane.  As a result of normal UMH behavior, the multicast stream
   received over the primary path is accepted and forwarded to the
   downstream receivers.  The copy of the stream received from the

Internet-Draft                    MoFRR                       April 2013


   secondary UNH is discarded.

   When a router detects a routing failure on the path to its its
   primary UMH, it will switch to the secondary UMH and accept packets
   for that stream.  If the failure is repaired the router may switch
   back.  The primary and secondary UMHs have only local context and not
   end-to-end context.

   As one can see, MoFRR achieves the faster convergence by pre-building
   the secondary multicast tree and receiving the traffic on that
   secondary path.  The example discussed above is a simple case where
   there are two ECMP paths from each PE device towards the source, one
   along the primary plane and one along the secondary.  In cases where
   the topology is asymmetric or is a ring, this ECMP nature does not
   hold, and additional rules have to be taken into account to choose
   when and where to join the secondary path.

   MoFRR is appealing in such topologies for the following reasons:

   1.  Ease of deployment and simplicity: the functionality is only
       required on the PE devices although it may be configured on all
       routers in the topology.  Furthermore, each PE device can be
       enabled separately.  PEs not enabled for MoFRR do not see any
       change or degradation.  Inter-operability testing is not required
       as there are no PIM or mLDP protocol change.

   2.  End-to-end failure detection and recovery: any failure along the
       path from the source to the PE can be detected and repaired with
       the secondary disjoint stream.

   3.  Capacity Efficiency: as illustrated in the previous example, the
       Multicast trees corresponding to IPTV channels cover the backbone
       and distribution topology in a very dense manner.  As a
       consequence, the secondary path graft into the normal Multicast
       trees (ie. trees signaled by PIM or mLDP without MoFRR extension)
       at the aggregation level and hence do not demand any extra
       capacity either on the distribution links or in the backbone.
       They simply use the capacity that is normally used, without any
       duplication.  This is different from conventional FRR mechanisms
       which often duplicate the capacity requirements (the backup path
       crosses links/nodes which already carry the primary/normal tree
       and hence twice as much capacity is required).

   4.  Loop free: the secondary path join is sent on an ECMP disjoint
       path.  By definition, the neighbor receiving this request is
       closer to the source and hence will not cause a loop.

   The topology we just analyzed is very frequent and can be modeled as

   per Fig2.  The PE has two ECMP disjoint paths to the source.  Each
   ECMP path uses a disjoint plane of the network.


                            Source
                            /    \
                        Plane1  Plane2

                           A1    A2
                             \  /
                              PE

           FIG2. PE is dual-homed to Dual-Plane Backbone


   Another frequent topology is described in Fig 3.  PEs are grouped by
   pairs.  In each pair, each PE is connected to a different plane.
   Each PE has one single shortest-path to a source (via its connected
   plane).  There is no ECMP like in Fig 2.  However, there is clearly a
   way to provide MoFRR benefits as each PE can offer a disjoint
   secondary path to the other plane PE (via the disjoint path).

   MoFRR secondary neighbor selection process needs to be extended in
   this case as one cannot simply rely on using an ECMP path as
   secondary neighbor.  This extension is referred to as non-ecmp
   extension and is described later in the document.

           FIG3. PEs are connected in pairs to Dual-Plane Backbone



5.  Detecting Failures

   Once the two paths are established, the next step is detecting a
   failure on the primary path to know when to switch to the backup
   path.

   A first option consists of comparing the packets received on the



Karan, et al.           Expires October 20, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                    MoFRR                       April 2013


   primary and secondary streams but only forwarding one of them -- the
   first one received, no matter which interface it is received on.
   Zero packet loss is possible for RTP-based streams.

   A second option assumes a minimum known packet rate for a given data
   stream.  If a packet is not received on the primary RPF within this
   time frame, the router assumes primary path failure and switches to
   the secondary RPF interface. 50msec switchover is possible.

   A third option leverages the significant improvements of the IGP
   convergence speed.  When the primary path to the source is withdrawn
   by the IGP, the MoFRR-enabled router switches over to the backup
   path, the UMH is changed to the secondary UMH.  Since the secondary
   path is already in place, and assuming it is disjoint from the
   primary path, convergence times would not include the time required
   to build a new tree and hence are smaller.  Realistic availability
   requirements (sub-second to sub-200msec) should be possible.

   A fourth option consists in leveraging connected link failure.  This
   option makes sense when MoFRR is deployed across the network (not
   only at PE).


6.  ECMP-mode MoFRR

   If the IGP installs two ECMP paths to the source and if the Multicast
   tree is enabled for ECMP-Mode MoFRR, the router installs them as
   primary and secondary UMH.  Only packets received from the primary
   UMH path are processed.  Packets received from the secondary UMH are
   dropped.

   The selected primary UMH should be the same as if MoFRR extension was
   not enabled.

   If more than two ECMP paths exist, two are selected as primary and
   secondary UMH.  Information from the IGP link-state topology could be
   leveraged to optimize this selection.

   Note, MoFRR does not restrict the number of UMH paths that are
   joined.  Implementations may use as many paths as are configured.


7.  Non-ECMP-mode MoFRR

   A router X configured for non-ECMP-mode MoFRR for a Multicast tree
   joins a primary path to its primary UMH R(X) and a secondary path to
   UMH N if the following three conditions are met.


   C1: xs < xn + ns
   C2: ns < nx + xs
   C3: X cannot join the secondary path N if N is the only member of the OIF list

   The first condition ensures that N is not on the primary branch from
   X to S.

   The second condition ensures that X is not on the primary branch from
   N to S.

   These two conditions ensure that at least locally the two paths are
   disjoint.

   The third condition is required to break control-plane loops which
   could occur in some scenarios.

   For example in FIG3, if PE1 and PE2 have received an igmp request for
   a Multicast tree, they will both join the primary path on their plane
   and a secondary path to the neighbor PE.  If their receivers would
   leave at the same time, it could be possible for the Multicast tree
   on PE1 and PE2 to never get deleted as each PE refresh each other via
   the secondary path joins (remember that a secondary path join is not
   distinguishable from a primary join.  MoFRR does not require any PIM
   or mLDP protocol modification).

   A control-plane loop occurs when two nodes keep a state forever due
   to joining the secondary path to each other.  This forever condition
   is not acceptable as no real receiver is connected to the nodes
   (directly via IGMP or indirectly via PIM).  Rule 3 prevents this case
   as it prevents the mutual refresh of secondary joins and it applies
   it in the specific case where there is no real receiver connected.

7.1.  Variation

   Rule R3 can be removed if Rule 2 is restricted as follows:

   R2p: ns < xs

   This ensures that X will only join the secondary path to a neighbor N
   who is strictly closer to the source than X is.  By reciprocity, N
   will thus never join the secondary path for the same Multicast tree
   via X. The strictly smaller than is key here.

   Note that this non-ECMP-mode MoFRR variation does not support the
   square topology and hence is less preferred.


8.  Keep It Simple Principle

   Many Service Providers devise their topology such that PEs have
   disjoint paths to the multicast sources.  MoFRR leverages the
   existence of these disjoint paths without any PIM or mLDP protocol
   modification.  Interoperability testing is thus not required.  In
   such topologies, MoFRR only needs to be deployed on the PE devices.
   Each PE device can be enabled one by one.  PEs not enabled for MoFRR
   do not see any change or degradation.

   Multicast streams with Tight SLA requirements are often characterized
   by a continuous high packet rate (SD video has a continuous
   interpacket gap of ~ 3msec).  MoFRR simply leverages the stream
   characteristic to detect any failures along the primary branch and
   switch-over on the secondary branch in a few 10s of msec.


9.  Capacity Planning for MoFRR

   As for LFA FRR (draft-ietf-rtgwg-lfa-applicability-00), MoFRR
   applicability is topology dependent.

   In this document, we have described two very frequent designs (Fig 2
   and Fig 3) which provide maximum MoFRR benefits.

   Designers with topologies different than Fig2 and 3 can still benefit

   from MoFRR benefits thanks to the use of capacity planning tools.

   Such tools are able to simulate the ability of each PE to build two
   disjoint branches of the same tree.  This for hundreds of PEs and
   hundreds of sources.

   This allows to assess the MoFRR protection coverage of a given
   network, for a set of sources.

   If the protection coverage is deemed insufficient, the designer can
   use such tool to optimize the topology (add links, change igp
   metrics).


10.  Other Applications

   While all the examples in this document show the MoFRR applicability
   on PE devices, it is clear that MoFRR could be enabled on aggregation
   or core routers.

   MoFRR can be popular in Data Center network configurations.  With the
   advent of lower cost ethernet and increasing port density in routers,
   there is more meshed connectivity than ever before.  When using a
   3-level access, distribution, and core layers in a Data Center, there
   is a lot of inexpensive bandwidth connecting the layers.  This will
   lend itself to more opportunities for ECMP paths at multiple layers.
   This allows for multiple layers of redundancy protecting link and
   node failure at each layer with minimal redundancy cost.

   Redundancy costs are reduced because only one packet is forwarded at
   every link along the primary and secondary data paths so there is no
   duplication of data on any link thereby providing make-before-break
   protection at a very small cost.

   Alternate methods to detect failures such as MPLS-OAM or BFD may be
   considered.

   The MoFRR principle may be applied to MVPNs.


11.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this design other than what
   is already in the main PIM specification [RFC4601] and mLDP
   specification [RFC6388] .
