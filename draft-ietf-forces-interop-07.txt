Internet-Draft           ForCES Interop Report                April 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document captures results of the second interoperability test of
   the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) which took
   place February 24-25, 2011 in the Internet Technology Lab (ITL) of
   Zhejiang Gongshang University, China.  The test involved protocol
   elements described in several documents namely:

      - ForCES Protocol [RFC5810]
      - ForCES Forwarding Element Model [RFC5812]
      - ForCES Transport Mapping Layer [RFC5811]

   The test also involved protocol elements described in the then-
   current versions of two Internet-Drafts.  Although these documents
   have subsequently been revised and advanced, it is important to
   understand which versions of the work were used during this test.
   The then-current Internet-Drafts are:

      - ForCES Logical Function Block (LFB) Library
      [I-D.ietf-forces-lfb-lib-03].
      - ForCES Intra-NE High Availability [I-D.ietf-forces-ceha-00].

   Three independent ForCES implementations participated in the test.

   Scenarios of ForCES LFB Operation, TML with IPSec, CE High
   Availability, and Packet Forwarding are constructed.  Series of
   testing items for every scenario are carried out and interoperability
   results are achieved.  Popular packet analyzers Ethereal/
   Wireshark[Ethereal] and Tcpdump[Tcpdump] are used to verify the wire
   results.

   This document is an update to RFC 6053, which captured the results of
   the first ForCES interoperability test.  The first test on ForCES was
   held in July 2008 at the University of Patras, Greece.  That test
   focused on validating the basic semantics of the ForCES protocol and
   ForCES FE model.

1.1.  ForCES Protocol

   The ForCES protocol works in a master-slave mode in which FEs are
   slaves and CEs are masters.  The protocol includes commands for
   transport of Logical Function Block (LFB) configuration information,
   association setup, status, and event notifications, etc.  The reader
   is encouraged to read the ForCES protocol specification [RFC5810] for
   further information.

1.2.  ForCES FE Model

Internet-Draft           ForCES Interop Report                April 2013


   The ForCES FE model [RFC5812]  presents a formal way to define FE
   Logical Function Blocks (LFBs) using XML.  LFB configuration
   components, capabilities, and associated events are defined when the
   LFB is formally created.  The LFBs within the FE are accordingly
   controlled in a standardized way by the ForCES protocol.

1.3.  Transport Mapping Layer

   The ForCES Transport Mapping Layer (TML) transports the ForCES
   Protocol Layer (PL) messages.  The TML is where the issues of how to
   achieve transport level reliability, congestion control, multicast,
   ordering, etc are handled.  It is expected that more than one TML
   will be standardized.  RFC 5811 specifies an SCTP-Based Transport
   Mapping Layer (TML) for ForCES protocol, which is a mandated TML for
   ForCES.  See RFC 5811 for more details.

1.4.  Definitions

   This document follows the terminology defined by ForCES related
   documents, including RFC3654, RFC3746, RFC5810, RFC5811, RFC5812,
   RFC5813, etc.

2.  Overview

2.1.  Date, Location, and Participants

   The second ForCES interoperability test meeting was held by IETF
   ForCES Working Group on February 24-25, 2011, and was chaired by
   Jamal Hadi Salim.  Three independent ForCES implementations
   participated in the test:

   o  Zhejiang Gongshang University/Hangzhou BAUD Corporation of
      Information and Networks Technology (Hangzhou BAUD Networks),
      China.  This implementation is referred to as "China" or in some
      cases "C" in the document for the sake of brevity.

   o  NTT Corporation, Japan.  This implementation is referred to as
      "Japan" or in some cases "J" in the document for the sake of
      brevity.

   o  The University of Patras, Greece.  This implementation is referred
      to as "Greece" or in some cases "G" in the document for the sake
      of brevity.

   Two other organizations, Mojatatu Networks and Hangzhou BAUD Networks
   Corporation, which independently extended two different well known
   public domain protocol analyzers, Ethereal/Wireshark [Ethereal] and
   Tcpdump [Tcpdump], also participated in the interop test.  During the

   interoperability test, the two protocol analyzers were used to verify
   the validity of ForCES protocol messages and in some cases semantics.

   Some issues related to interoperability among implementations were
   discovered.  Most of the issues were solved on site during the test.
   The most contentious issue found was on the format of encapsulation
   for protocol TLV (Refer to Section 5.1 ).

   Some errata related to ForCES document were found by the
   interoperability test.  The errata has been reported to related IETF
   RFCs.

   At times, interoperability testing was exercised between two instead
   of all three representative implementations due to a third one
   lacking a specific feature; however, in ensuing discussions, all
   implementers mentioned they will be implementing any missing features
   in the future.

2.2.  Testbed Configuration

2.2.1.  Participants Access

   Japan and China physically attended on site at the Internet
   Technology Lab (ITL) of Zhejiang Gongshang University in China.  The
   University of Patras implementation joined remotely from Greece.  The
   chair, Jamal Hadi Salim, joined remotely from Canada by using the
   Teamviewer as the monitoring tool[Teamviewer].  The approach is as
   shown in Figure 1.  In the figure, FE/CE refers to FE or CE that the
   implementer may act alternatively.

   As specified in RFC 5811, all CEs and FEs shall implement IPSec
   security in the TML.

   On the internet boundary, gateways used must allow for IPSec, SCTP
   protocol and SCTP ports as defined in the ForCES SCTP-TML [RFC5811] .

2.2.2.  Testbed Configuration

   CEs and FEs from China and Japan implementations were physically
   located within the ITL Lab of Zhejiang Gongshang University and
   connected together using Ethernet switches.  The configuration can be
   seen in Figure 2.  In the figure, the SmartBits is a third-party
   supplied routing protocol testing machine, which acts as a router
   running OSPF and RIP and exchanges routing protocol messages with
   ForCES routers in the network.  The Internet is connected via an ADSL
   channel.

   All above testbed configurations can then satisfy requirements of all
   the interoperability test scenarios that are mentioned in this
   document.

3.  Scenarios

3.1.  Scenario 1 - LFB Operation

   This scenario is to test the interoperability on LFB operations among
   the participants.  The connection diagram for the participants is as
   shown in Figure 4.

                   Figure 4: Scenario for LFB Operation

   In order to make interoperability more credible, the three
   implementers are required to carry out the test in a way acting as CE
   or FE alternatively.  As a result, every LFB operation is combined
   with 6 scenarios, as shown by Figure 4.

Internet-Draft           ForCES Interop Report                April 2013


   The test scenario is designed with the following purposes:

   Firstly, the scenario is designed to verify all kinds of protocol
   messages with their complex data formats, which are defined in RFC
   5810.  Specially, we try to verify the data format of a PATH-DATA
   with nested PATH-DATAs, and the operation(SET, GET, DEL) of an array
   or an array with a nested array.

   Secondly, the scenario is designed to verify the definition of ForCES
   LFB Library [I-D.ietf-forces-lfb-lib-03], which defines a base set of
   ForCES LFB classes for typical router functions.  Successful test
   under this scenario also means the validity of the LFB definitions.

3.2.  Scenario 2 - TML with IPSec

   This scenario is designed to implement a TML with IPSec, which is the
   requirement by RFC 5811.  TML with IPSec was not implemented in the
   first ForCES interoperability test as reported by RFC 6053.  For this
   reason, in the second interoperability test, we specifically designed
   the test scenario to verify the TML over IPSec channel.

   In this scenario, tests on LFB operations for Scenario 1 were
   repeated with the difference that TML was secured via IPSec.  This
   setup scenario allows us to verify whether all interactions between
   CE and FE can be made correctly under an IPSec TML environment.

   The connection diagram for this scenario is shown as Figure 5.
   Because of system deficiency to deploy IPSec over TML in Greece, the
   text only took place between China and Japan.

   In this scenario, ForCES TML was run over IPSec channel.
   Implementers joined in this interoperability have used the same
   third-party software 'racoon' to have established the IPSec channel.

   China and Japan have made a successful test with the scenario, and
   the following items have been realized:

   o  Internet Key Exchange (IKE) with certificates for endpoint
      authentication.

   o  Transport Mode Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).  HMAC-SHA1-96
      for message integrity protection.

3.3.  Scenario 3 - CE High Availability

   CE High Availability (CEHA) was tested based on the ForCES CEHA
   document [I-D.ietf-forces-ceha-00]

   The design of the setup and the scenario for the CEHA were simplified
   so as to focus mostly on the mechanics of the CEHA, which are:

   o  Associating with more than one CE.

   o  Switching to backup CE on master CE failure.

   The connection diagram for the scenario is as shown in Figure 6.

                (a)                           (b)

                Figure 6: Scenario for CE High Availability

   In this scenario one FE is connected and associated to a master CE
   and a backup CE.  In the pre-association phase, the FE would be
   configured to have China's or Japan's CE as master CE and Greece's CE
   as standby CE.  The CEFailoverPolicy component of the FE Protocol
   Object LFB that specifies whether the FE is in High Availability mode
   (value 2 or 3) would either be set in the pre-association phase by
   the FEM interface or in post-association phase by the master CE.

Internet-Draft           ForCES Interop Report                April 2013


   If the CEFailoverPolicy value is set to 2 or 3, the FE (in the post-
   association phase) will attempt to connect and associate with the
   standby CE.

   When the master CE is deemed disconnected, either by a TearDown, Loss
   of Heartbeats or physically disconnected, the FE would assume that
   the standby CE is now the master CE.  The FE will then send an Event
   Notification, Primary CE Down,to all associated CEs, only the standby
   CE in this case, with the value of the new master CEID.  The standby
   CE will then respond by sending a configuration message to the CEID
   component of the FE Protocol Object with its own ID to confirm that
   the CE considers itself as the master as well.

   The steps of the CEHA test scenario are as follows:

   1.  In the pre-association phase, setup of FE with master CE and
       backup CE

   2.  FE connecting and associating with master CE.

   3.  When CEFailoverPolicy is set to 2 or 3, the FE will connect and
       associate with backup CE.

   4.  Once the master CE is considered disconnected then the FE chooses
       the first Associated backup CE.

   5.  It sends an Event Notification specifying that the master CE is
       down and who is now the master CE.

   6.  The new master CE sends a SET Configuration message to the FE
       setting the CEID value to who is now the new master CE completing
       the switch.

3.4.  Scenario 4 - Packet forwarding

   This test scenario is to verify LFBs like RedirectIn, RedirectOut,
   IPv4NextHop, IPv4UcastLPM defined by the ForCES LFB library document
   [I-D.ietf-forces-lfb-lib-03], and more importantly, to verify the
   combination of the LFBs to implement IP packet forwarding.

   The connection diagram for this scenario is as Figure 7.

   In case (a), a CE by Japan is connected to an FE by China to form a
   ForCES router.  A Smartbits test machine with its routing protocol
   software are used to simulate an OSPF router and are connected with
   the ForCES router to try to exchange OSPF hello packets and LSA
   packets among them.  Terminals are simulated by Smartbits to send and
   receive packets.  As a result, the CE in the ForCES router need to be
   configured to run and support OSPF routing protocol.

   In case (b), a CE by China is connected to an FE by Japan to form a
   ForCES router.  Two routers running OSPF are simulated and connected
   to the ForCES router to test if the ForCES router can support OSPF
   protocol and support packet forwarding.

   In case (c), two ForCES routers are constructed.  One is with CE by
   Japan and FE by China and the other is opposite.  OSPF and packet
   forwarding are tested in the environment.

   Testing process for this scenario is as below:

   1.  Boot terminals and routers, and set IP addresses of their
       interfaces.

   2.  Boot CE and FE.

   3.  Establish association between CE and FE, and set IP addresses of
       FEs interfaces.

   4.  Start OSPF among CE and routers, and set FIB on FE.

   5.  Send packets between terminals.

   The test result is as reported by Figure 8.  For the convenience
   sake, as mentioned earlier, abbreviations of 'C' in the table means
   implementation from China,'J'Japan implementation, and 'G' Greece

                   Figure 8: LFB Operation Test Results

   Note on test 1#:

   On the wire format of encapsulation on array, only the case of
   FULLDATA-in-FULLDATA was tested.

   In China's implementation, after test 2# CE have to get all LFBs'
   instance data actively according to the queried component of
   LFBSelectors.

   Note on test 28# and 29#:

   Only had new reachable network destination been set, can route entry
   be added into system.

   Note on test 30# and 31#:

   Corresponding nexthop entry must be deleted before prefix entry which
   is decided by FE's routing management.

4.2.  TML with IPSec Test

   In this scenario, the ForCES TML is run over IPSec.  Implementers
   joined this interoperability test use the same third-party tool
   software 'racoon' to establish IPSec channel.  Some typical LFB
   operation tests as in Scenario 1 are repeated with the IPSec enabled
   TML.

   A note on this test is, because of the system difficulty to implement
   IPSec over TML, Greece did not join in the test.  Therefore, this
   scenario only took place between C and J.

   The TML with IPSec test results are reported by Figure 9.

4.3.  CE High Availability Test

   In this scenario one FE connects and associates with a master CE and
   a backup CE.  When the master CE is deemed disconnected the FE would
   attempt to find another associated CE to become the master CE.

   The CEHA scenario as is described in Scenario 3 was completed
   successfully for both setups.

   Due to a bug in one of the FEs, a interesting issue was caught: it
   was observed that the buggy FE took up to a second to failover.  It
   was eventually found that the issue was due to the FE's
   prioritization of the different CEs.  All messages from the backup CE
   were being ignored unless the master CE is disconnected.

   While the bug was fixed and the CEHA scenario was completed
   successfully, the authors feel it was important to capture the
   implementation issue in this document.  The recommended approach is
   the following:

   o  The FE should receive and handle messages first from the master CE
      on all priority channels to maintain proper functionality and then
      receive and handle messages from the backup CEs.

   o  Only when the FE is attempting to associate with the backup CEs,
      then the FE should receive and handle messages per priority
      channel from all CEs.  When all backup CEs are associated with or
      deemed unreachable, then the FE should return to receiving and
      handling messages first from the master CE.

4.4.  Packet Forwarding Test

   As described in the ForCES LFB library [I-D.ietf-forces-lfb-lib-03],
   packet forwarding is implemented by a set of LFB classes that compose



Wang, et al.            Expires October 17, 2013               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft           ForCES Interop Report                April 2013


   a processing path for packets.  In this test scenario, as shown in
   Figure 7, a ForCES router running OSPF protocol was constructed.  In
   addition, a set of LFBs including RedirectIn, RedirectOut,
   IPv4UcastLPM, and IPv4NextHop LFBs are used.  RedirectIn and
   RedirectOut LFBs redirect OSPF hello and LSA packets from and to CE.
   A Smartbits test machine is used to simulate an OSPF router and
   exchange the OSPF hello and LSA packets with CE in ForCES router.

   Cases (a) and (b) in Figure 7 both need a RedirectIn LFB to send OSPF
   packets generated by CE to FE by use of ForCES packet redirect
   messages.  The OSPF packets are further sent to an outside OSPF
   Router by the FE via forwarding LFBs including IPv4NextHop and
   IPv4UcastLPM LFBs.  A RedirectOut LFB in the FE is used to send OSPF
   packets received from outside OSPF Router to CE by ForCES packet
   redirect messages.

   By running OSPF, the CE in the ForCES router can generate new routes
   and load them to routing table in FE.  The FE is then able to forward
   packets according to the routing table.

   The test is reported with the results in Figure 10

                 Figure 10: Packet Forwarding Test Results

   Note on test 1# and 2#:

   A multicast route pointed to localhost was manually set before
   redirect channel could work normally.

   Note on test 3# to 9#:

   During the tests, OSPF packets received from CE were found by
   Ethereal/Wireshark with checksum errors.  China's FE corrected the
   checksum in FE so that the Smartbits would not drop the packets and

Internet-Draft           ForCES Interop Report                April 2013


   Comment on Test #16 and #17:

   The two test items failed.  Note that Test #7 and #8 are exactly the
   same as these tests, only with CE and FE implementers are exchanged,
   and Test #12 and #13 show the redirect channel works well.  As a
   result, it can be inferred that the problem caused the test failure
   was almost certainly from the implementation of the related LFBs
   rather than from the ForCES protocol design problem, therefore the
   failure does not lead to the interoperability problem on ForCES.

5.  Discussions

5.1.  On Data Encapsulation Format

   In the first day of the test, it was found that the LFB inter-
   operations about tables all failed.  The reason is found to be the
   different ForCES protocol data encapsulation method among different
   implementations.  The encapsulation issues are detailed as below:

   Assuming that an LFB has two components, one is a struct with ID 1
   and the other an array with ID 2, further with two components of u32
   both inside, as below:

   struct1: type struct, ID=1
       components are:
       a, type u32, ID=1
       b, type u32, ID=2

   table1: type array, ID=2
       components for each row are (a struct of):
       x, type u32, ID=1
       y, type u32, ID=2


   1.  On response of PATH-DATA format

   When a CE sends a config/query ForCES protocol message to an FE from
   a different implementer, the CE probably receives response from the
   FE with different PATH-DATA encapsulation format.  For example, if a
   CE sends a query message with a path of 1 to a third party FE to
   manipulate struct 1 as defined above, the FE is probable to generate
   response with two different PATH-DATA encapsulation format: one is
   the value with FULL/SPARSE-DATA and the other is the value with many
   parallel PATH-DATA TLV and nested PATH-DATA TLV, as below:

   format 1:
       OPER = GET-RESPONSE-TLV
           PATH-DATA-TLV:

Internet-Draft           ForCES Interop Report                April 2013


               IDs=1
               FULLDATA-TLV containing valueof(a),valueof(b)
   format 2:
       OPER = GET-RESPONSE-TLV
           PATH-DATA-TLV:
               IDs=1
               PATH-DATA-TLV:
                   IDs=1
                   FULLDATA-TLV containing valueof(a)
               PATH-DATA-TLV:
                   IDs=2
                   FULLDATA-TLV containing valueof(b)


   The interoperability test witnessed that a ForCES element (CE or FE)
   sender is free to choose whatever data structure that IETF ForCES
   documents define and best suits the element, while a ForCES element
   (CE or FE) should be able to accept and process information (requests
   and responses) that use any legitimate structure defined by IETF
   ForCES documents.  While in the case a ForCES element is free to
   choose any legitimate data structure as a response, it is preferred
   the ForCES element responds in the same format that the request was
   made, as it is most probably the data structure is the request sender
   looks forward to receive.

   2.  On operation to array

   An array operation may also have several different data encapsulation
   formats.  For instance, if a CE sends a config message to table 1
   with a path of (2.1), which refers to component with ID=2, which is
   an array, and the second ID is the row, so row 1, it may be
   encapsulated with three formats as below:

Internet-Draft           ForCES Interop Report                April 2013


   format 1:
       OPER = SET-TLV
           PATH-DATA-TLV:
               IDs=2.1
               FULLDATA-TLV containing valueof(x),valueof(y)
   format 2:
       OPER = SET-TLV
           PATH-DATA-TLV:
               IDs=2.1
               PATH-DATA-TLV:
                   IDs=1
                   FULLDATA-TLV containing valueof(x)
               PATH-DATA-TLV
                   IDs=2
                   FULLDATA-TLV containing valueof(y)


   Moreover, if CE is targeting the whole array, for example if the
   array is empty and CE wants to add the first row to the table, it
   could also adopt another format:

   format 3:
       OPER = SET-TLV
           PATH-DATA-TLV:
               IDs=2
               FULLDATA-TLV containing rowindex=1,valueof(x),valueof(y)



   The interoperability test experience shows that format 1 and format
   3, which take full advantage of multiple data elements description in
   one TLV of FULLDATA-TLV, get more efficiency, although format 2 can
   also get the same operating goal.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   Developers of ForCES FEs and CEs must take the security
   considerations of the ForCES Framework [RFC3746]  and the ForCES
   Protocol [RFC5810]  into account.  Also, as specified in the security
   considerations section of the SCTP-Based TML for the ForCES Protocol
   [RFC5811], the transport-level security has to be ensured by IPsec.
