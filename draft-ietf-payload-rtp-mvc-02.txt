Internet-Draft     RTP Payload Format for MVC Video           June 2012


Abstract

   This memo describes an RTP payload format for Multiview Video Coding
   (MVC), the multiview extension of the ITU-T Recommendation H.264
   video codec that is technically identical to ISO/IEC International
   Standard 14496-10.  The RTP payload format allows for packetization
   of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units, produced by
   the video encoder, in each RTP payload.  The payload format can be
   applied in RTP based 3D video transmissions such as such as 3D video
   streaming, free-viewpoint video, and 3DTV.

1. Introduction

   This memo specifies an RTP [RFC3550] payload format for the
   multiview extension of the H.264/AVC video coding standard, also
   known as Multiview Video Coding (MVC).  MVC is specified in Annex H
   of ITU-T Rec. H.264 [H.264] | ISO/IEC 14496 Part 10 [MPEG4-10].

   MVC covers a wide range of 3D video applications, including 3D video
   streaming, free-viewpoint video as well as 3DTV.

   This memo follows a backward compatible enhancement philosophy, by
   keeping as close an alignment to the H.264/AVC payload format
   [RFC6184] as possible.  It documents the enhancements relevant from
   an RTP transport viewpoint, and defines signaling support for MVC,
   including a new media subtype name.

   Due to the similarity between MVC and Scalable Video Coding (SVC),
   as defined in Annex G of H.264 [H.264], in system and transport
   aspects, this memo reuses the design principles as well as many
   features of the SVC RTP payload draft [RFC6190].



   [Ed.Note(TS):Need text on session multiplexing and on the relation
   of this draft to [RFC6190] here.]

Internet-Draft     RTP Payload Format for MVC Video           June 2012


1.1. The MVC Codec

1.1.1. Overview

   MVC provides multi-view video bitstreams.  An MVC bitstream contains
   a base view conforming to at least one of the profiles of H.264/AVC
   defined in Annex A of [H.264], and one or more non-base views.  To
   enable high compression efficiency, coding of a non-base view can
   utilize other views for inter-view prediction, thus its decoding
   relies on the presence of the views it depends on.  Each coded view
   itself may be temporally scalable.  Besides temporal scalability,
   MVC also supports view scalability, wherein a subset of the encoded
   views can be extracted, decoded and displayed, whenever it is
   desired by the application.

   The concept of video coding layer (VCL) and network abstraction
   layer (NAL) is inherited from H.264/AVC.  The VCL contains the
   signal processing functionality of the codec; mechanisms such as
   transform, quantization, motion-compensated prediction, loop
   filtering and inter-view prediction.  The NAL encapsulates each
   slice generated by the VCL into one or more NAL units.  Please
   consult RFC 6184 for a more in-depth discussion of the NAL unit
   concept.  MVC specifies the decoding order of NAL units.

   In MVC, one access unit contains all NAL units pertaining to one
   output time instance for all the views.  Within one access unit, the
   coded representation of each view, also named as view component,
   consists of one or more slices.

   The concept of temporal scalability is not newly introduced by SVC
   or MVC, as profiles defined in Annex A of [H.264] already support
   it.  In [H.264], sub-sequences have been introduced in order to
   allow optional use of temporal layers.  SVC extended this approach
   by advertising the temporal scalability information within the NAL
   unit header or prefix NAL units, both were inherited to MVC.

1.1.2. Parameter Set Concept

   The parameter set concept was first specified in [H.264].  Please
   refer to section 1.2 of [RFC6184] for more details.  SVC introduced
   some new parameter set mechanisms.  MVC has inherited the parameter
   set concept from [H.264].

   In particular, a different type of sequence parameter set (SPS),
   which is referred to as subset SPS, using a different NAL unit type
   than "the old SPS" specified in [H.264] is used for non-base views,
   while the base view still uses "the old SPS".  Slices from different

   views would be able to use either 1) the same sequence or picture
   parameter set, or 2) different sequence or picture parameter sets.

   The inter-view dependency and the decoding order of all the encoded
   views are indicated in a new syntax structure, the SPS MVC
   extension, included in each subset SPS.

1.1.3. Network Abstraction Layer Unit Header

   An MVC NAL unit of type 20 or 14 consists of a header of four octets
   and the payload byte string.  MVC NAL units of type 20 are coded
   slices of non-base views.  A special type of an MVC NAL unit is the
   prefix NAL unit (type 14) that includes descriptive information of
   the associated H.264/AVC VCL NAL unit (type 1 or 5) that immediately
   follows the prefix NAL unit.

   MVC extends the one-byte H.264/AVC NAL unit header by three
   additional octets.  The header indicates the type of the NAL unit,
   information regarding the relative importance of the NAL unit for
   the decoding process, the view identification information, the
   temporal layer identification information, and other fields as
   discussed below.

   The syntax and semantics of the NAL unit header are formally
   specified in [H.264], but the essential properties of the NAL unit
   header are summarized below.

   The first byte of the NAL unit header has the following format (the
   bit fields are the same as defined for the one-byte H.264/AVC NAL
   unit header, while the semantics of some fields have changed
   slightly, in a backward compatible way):

         +---------------+
         |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |F|NRI|  Type   |
         +---------------+

   F: 1 bit

   forbidden_zero_bit.  H.264/AVC declares a value of 1 as a syntax
   violation.

   NRI: 2 bits

   nal_ref_idc.  A value of 00 indicates that the content of the NAL
   unit is not used to reconstruct reference pictures for future


Wang et al            Expires December 25, 2012                [Page 5]

   prediction.  Such NAL units can be discarded without risking the
   integrity of the reference pictures in the same view.  A value
   higher than 00 indicates that the decoding of the NAL unit is
   required to maintain the integrity of reference pictures in the same
   view, or that the NAL unit contains parameter sets.

   Type: 5 bits

   nal_unit_type.  This component specifies the NAL unit type.

   In H.264/AVC, NAL unit types 14 and 20 are reserved for future
   extensions.  MVC uses these two NAL unit types.  NAL unit type 14 is
   used for prefix NAL unit, and NAL unit type 20 is used for coded
   slice of non-base view.  NAL unit types 14 and 20 indicate the
   presence of three additional octets in the NAL unit header, as shown
   below.

            +---------------+---------------+---------------+
            |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |S|I|  PRID     | VID               | TID |A|V|O|
            +---------------+---------------+---------------+

   S: 1 bit

   svc_extention_flag.  MUST be equal to 0 in MVC context.  In the
   context of Scalable Video Coding (SVC), the flag must be equal to 1.

   I: 1 bit

   non_idr_flag.  This component specifies whether the access unit the
   NAL unit belongs to is an IDR access unit (when equal to 0) or not
   (when equal to 1), as specified in [H.264].

   PRID: 6 bits

   priority_id.  This flag specifies a priority identifier for the NAL
   unit.  A lower value of PRID indicates a higher priority.

   VID: 10 bits

   view_id.  This component specifies the view identifier of the view
   the NAL unit belongs to.

   TID: 3 bits

   temporal_id.  This component specifies the temporal layer (or frame
   rate) hierarchy.  Informally put, a temporal layer consisting of
   view component with a less temporal_id corresponds to a lower frame
   rate.  A given temporal layer typically depends on the lower
   temporal layers (i.e. the temporal layers with less temporal_id
   values) but never depends on any higher temporal layer (i.e. a
   temporal layer with a greater temporal_id value).

   A: 1 bit

   anchor_pic_flag.  This component specifies whether the access unit
   the NAL unit belongs to is an anchor access unit (when equal to 1)
   or not (when equal to 0), as specified in [H.264].

   V: 1 bit

   inter_view_flag.  This component specifies whether the view
   component is used for inter-view prediction (when equal to 1) or not
   (when equal to 0).

   O: 1 bit

   reserved_one_bit.  Reserved bit for future extension.  R shall be
   equal to 1.  Receivers SHOULD ignore the value of
   reserved_zero_one_bit.  This memo reuses the same additional NAL
   unit types introduced in RFC 6190, which are presented in section
   4.2.  In addition, this memo introduces one more NAL unit type, 30,
   as specified in section 4.7.  These NAL unit types are marked as
   unspecified in [H.264] and intentionally reserved for use in systems
   specifications like this memo.  Moreover, this specification extends
   the semantics of F, NRI, PRID, TID, A, and I as described in section
   4.3.



1.2. Overview of the Payload Format

   This payload specification can only be used to carry the "naked" NAL
   unit stream over RTP, and not the byte stream format according to
   Annex B of [H.264].  Likely, the applications of this specification
   will be in the IP based multimedia communications fields including
   3D video streaming over IP, free-viewpoint video over IP, and 3DTV
   over IP.

   This specification allows, in a given RTP packet stream, to
   encapsulate NAL units belonging to

     o the base view only, detailed specification in [RFC6184], or

     o one or more non-base views, or

     o the base view and one or non-base views

   [Ed.Note(YkW): To be extended to allow separate carriage of
   different temporal layers in different RTP packet streams as in
   [RFC6190].]

1.2.1. Design Principles

   The following design principles have been observed:

     o Backward compatibility with [RFC6184] wherever possible.

     o As the MVC base view is H.264/AVC compatible, the base view or
        any H.264/AVC compatible subset of it, when transmitted in its
        own RTP packet stream, MUST be encapsulated using [RFC6184].
        Requiring this has the desirable side effect that the
        transmitted data can be received by [RFC6184] receivers and
        decoded by H.264/AVC decoders.

     o Media-Aware Network Elements (MANEs) as defined in [RFC6184]
        are signaling aware and rely on signaling information.  MANEs
        have state.

     o MANEs can aggregate multiple RTP streams, possibly from
        multiple RTP sessions.

     o MANEs can perform media-aware stream thinning.  By using the
        payload header information identifying Layers within an RTP
        session, MANEs are able to remove packets from the incoming RTP
        packet stream.  This implies rewriting the RTP headers of the
        outgoing packet stream and rewriting of RTCP Receiver Reports.

1.2.2. Transmission Modes and Packetization Modes

   Please see section 1.2.2 of [RFC6190].

2. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the notion of setting and clearing a bit
   when bit fields are handled.  Setting a bit is the same as assigning
   that bit the value of 1 (On).  Clearing a bit is the same as
   assigning that bit the value of 0 (Off).



3. Definitions and Abbreviations

3.1. Definitions

3.1.1. Definitions per the MVC Specification

   This document uses the definitions of [H.264].  The following terms,
   defined in [H.264], are summed up for convenience:

   access unit:  A set of NAL units always containing exactly one
   primary coded picture with one or more view components. In addition
   to the primary coded picture, an access unit may also contain one or
   more redundant coded pictures, one auxiliary coded picture, or other
   NAL units not containing slices or slice data partitions of a coded
   picture. The decoding of an access unit always results in one
   decoded picture. All slices or slice data partitions in an access
   unit have the same value of picture order count.

  anchor access unit: An access unit in which the primary coded picture
  is an anchor picture.

  anchor picture: A coded picture in which all slices may reference
  only slices within the same access unit, i.e., inter-view prediction
  may be used, but no inter prediction is used, and all following coded
  pictures in output order do not use inter prediction from any picture
  prior to the coded picture in decoding order.  The value of
  anchor_pic_flag is equal to 1 for all the prefix NAL units (when
  present) and all the slice extension NAL units that are contained in
  an anchor picture.

  base view: A bitstream subset that contains all the NAL units with
  the nal_unit_type syntax element equal to 1, 5 or 14 of the bitstream
  and does not contain any NAL unit with the nal_unit_type syntax
  element equal to 15, or 20 and conforms to one or more of the
  profiles specified in Annex A of [H.264].

   prefix NAL unit:  A NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 14 that
   immediately precedes a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1, 5,
   or 12.  The NAL unit that succeeds the prefix NAL unit is also
   referred to as the associated NAL unit.  The prefix NAL unit

   contains data associated with the associated NAL unit, which are
   considered to be part of the associated NAL unit.





  target output view: A view that is targeted for output.

  view component: An access unit subset containing only NAL units that
  share to the same view identifier.



3.1.2. Definitions Specific to this Memo

   MVC NAL unit:  A NAL unit of NAL unit type 14 or 20 as specified in
   Annex H of [H.264]. An MVC NAL unit has a four-byte NAL unit header.

   operation point:  An operation point of an MVC bitstream represents
   a certain level of temporal and view scalability.  An operation
   point contains only those NAL units required for a valid bitstream
   to represent a certain subset of views at a certain temporal level.
   An operation point is described by the view_id values of the subset
   of views, and the highest temporal_id.

   multi-session transmission: The transmission mode in which the MVC
   bitstream is transmitted over multiple RTP sessions, with each
   stream having the same SSRC.  These multiple RTP streams can be
   associated using the RTCP CNAME, or explicit signalling of the SSRC
   used.  Dependency between RTP sessions MUST be signaled according to
   [RFC5583] and this memo.

   single-session transmission: The transmission mode in which the MVC
   bitstream is transmitted over a single RTP session, with a single
   SSRC and separate timestamp and sequence number spaces.

   cross-session decoding order number (CS-DON): A derived variable
   indicating NAL unit decoding order number over all NAL units within
   all the session-multiplexed RTP sessions that carry the same MVC
   bitstream.

3.1. Abbreviations

   In addition to the abbreviations defined in [RFC6184], the following

4. MVC RTP Payload Format

4.1. RTP Header Usage

   Please see section 5.1 of [RFC6184].

4.2. Common Structure of the RTP Payload Format

   Please see section 5.2 of [RFC6184].

4.3. NAL Unit Header Usage

   The structure and semantics of the NAL unit header were introduced
   in section 1.1.3.  This section specifies the semantics of F, NRI,
   PRID, TID, A and I according to this specification.

   Note that, in the context of this section, "protecting a NAL unit"
   means any RTP or network transport mechanism that could improve the
   probability of success delivery of the packet conveying the NAL
   unit, including applying a QoS-enabled network, forward error
   correction (FEC), retransmissions, and advanced scheduling behavior,
   whenever possible.

   The semantics of F specified in section 5.3 of [RFC6184] also
   applies herein.

   For NRI, for a bitstream conforming to one of the profiles defined
   in Annex A of [H.264] and transported using [RFC6184], the semantics
   specified in section 5.3 of [RFC6184] are applicable, i.e., NRI also
   indicates the relative importance of NAL units.  In MVC context, in
   addition to the semantics specified in Annex H of [H.264] are
   applicable, NRI also indicate the relative importance of NAL units
   within a view.  MANEs MAY use this information to protect more
   important NAL units better than less important NAL units.
   [Ed.Note(YkW): "MVC context" to be clearly specified.]

Internet-Draft     RTP Payload Format for MVC Video           June 2012


   For PRID, the semantics specified in Annex H of [H.264] applies.
   Note that MANEs implementing unequal error protection MAY use this
   information to protect NAL units with smaller PRID values better
   than those with larger PRID values, for example by including only
   the more important NAL units in a forward error correction (FEC)
   protection mechanism.  The importance for the decoding process
   decreases as the PRID value increases.

   For TID, in addition to the semantics specified in Annex H of
   [H.264], according to this memo, values of TID indicate the relative
   importance.  A lower value of TID indicates a higher importance for
   NAL units within a view.  MANEs MAY use this information to protect
   more important NAL units better than less important NAL units.

   For A, in addition to the semantics specified in Annex H of [H.264],
   according to this memo, MANEs MAY use this information to protect
   NAL units with A equal to 1 better than NAL units with A equal to 0.
   MANEs MAY also utilize information of NAL units with A equal to 1 to
   decide when to forward more packets for an RTP packet stream.  For
   example, when it is sensed that view switching has happened such
   that the operation point has changed, MANEs MAY start to forward NAL
   units for a new target view only after forwarding a NAL unit with A
   equal to 1 for the new target view.

   For I, in addition to the semantics specified in Annex H of [H.264],
   according to this memo, MANEs MAY use this information to protect
   NAL units with I equal to 1 better than NAL units with I equal to 0.
   MANEs MAY also utilize information of NAL units with I equal to 1 to
   decide when to forward more packets for an RTP packet stream.  For
   example, when it is sensed that view switching has happened such
   that the operation point has changed, MANEs MAY start to forward NAL
   units for a new target view only after forwarding a NAL unit with I
   equal to 1 for the new target view.

4.7. Payload Content Scalability Information (PACSI) NAL Unit for MVC

   A new NAL unit type is specified in this memo, and referred to as
   payload content scalability information (PACSI) NAL unit.  The PACSI
   NAL unit, if present, MUST be the first NAL unit in an aggregation
   packet, and it MUST NOT be present in other types of packets.  The
   PACSI NAL unit indicates view and temporal scalability information
   and other characteristics that are common for all the remaining NAL
   units in the payload of the aggregation packet. Furthermore, a PACSI
   NAL unit MAY include a DONC field and contain zero or more SEI NAL
   units.  PACSI NAL unit makes it easier for MANEs to decide whether
   to forward/process/discard the aggregation packet containing the
   PACSI NAL unit.  Senders MAY create PACSI NAL units and receivers
   MAY ignore them, or use them as hints to enable efficient
   aggregation packet processing.  Note that the NAL unit type for the
   PACSI NAL unit is selected among those values that are unspecified
   in [H.264] and [RFC6184].

   When the first aggregation unit of an aggregation packet contains a
   PACSI NAL unit, there MUST be at least one additional aggregation
   unit present in the same packet.  The RTP header and payload header
   fields of the aggregation packet are set according to the remaining
   NAL units in the aggregation packet.

   When a PACSI NAL unit is included in a multi-time aggregation packet
   (MTAP), the decoding order number (DON) for the PACSI NAL unit MUST
   be set to indicate that the PACSI NAL unit has an identical DON to
   the first NAL unit in decoding order among the remaining NAL units
   in the aggregation packet.

   The structure of a PACSI NAL unit is as follows.  The first four
   octets are exactly the same as the four-byte MVC NAL unit header as
   discussed in section 4.3.  They are followed by two always present
   octet, two optional octets, and zero or more SEI NAL units, each SEI

   NAL unit preceded by a 16-bit unsigned size field (in network byte
   order) that indicates the size of the following NAL unit in bytes
   (excluding these two octets, but including the NAL unit type octet
   of the SEI NAL unit).  Figure 1 illustrates the PACSI NAL unit
   structure and an example of a PACSI NAL unit containing two SEI NAL
   units.

   The bits P, C, S, and E are specified only if the bit X is equal to
   1. The T bit MUST NOT be equal to 1 if the aggregation packet
   containing the PACSI NAL unit is not an STAP-A packet.  The T bit
   MAY be equal to 1 if the aggregation packet containing the PACSI NAL
   unit is an STAP-A packet.  The field DONC MUST NOT be present if the
   T bit is equal to 0, and MUST be present if the T bit is equal to 1.

         Figure 1.  PACSI NAL unit structure

   The values of the fields in PACSI NAL unit MUST be set as follows.
   The term "target NAL units" are used in the semantics of some
   fields.  The target NAL units are such NAL units contained in the
   aggregation packet, but not included in the PACSI NAL unit, that are
   within the access unit to which the first NAL unit following the
   PACSI NAL unit in the aggregation packet belongs.

   o The F bit MUST be set to 1 if the F bit in at least one of the
   remaining NAL units in the aggregation packet is equal to 1.
   Otherwise, the F bit MUST be set to 0.

   o The NRI field MUST be set to the highest value of NRI field among
   all the remaining NAL units in the aggregation packet.

   o The Type field MUST be set to 30.

   o The S bit MUST be set to 1.

   o The PRID field MUST be set to the lowest value of the PRID values
   of all the remaining NAL units in the aggregation packet.

   o The TID field MUST be set to the lowest value of the TID values of
   all the remaining NAL units with the lowest value of VID in the
   aggregation packet.

   o The A bit MUST be set to 1 if the A bit of at least one of the
   remaining NAL units in the aggregation packet is equal to 1.
   Otherwise, the A bit MUST be set to 0.

   o The VID field MUST be set to the lowest value of the VID values of
   all the remaining NAL units in the aggregation packet.

   o The I bit MUST be set to 1 if the I bit of at least one of the
   remaining NAL units in the aggregation packet is equal to 1.
   Otherwise, the I bit MUST be set to 0.

   o The V bit MUST be set to 1 if the V bit of at least one of the
   remaining NAL units in the aggregation packet is equal to 1.
   Otherwise, the A bit MUST be set to 0.

   o The R bit MUST be set to 0.  Receivers SHOULD ignore the value of
   R.

   o If the X bit is equal to 1, the bits P, C, S, and E are specified
   as below. Otherwise, the bits P, C, S, and E are unspecified, and
   receivers MUST ignore these bits.  The X bit SHOULD be identical for
   all the PACSI NAL units involved in all the RTP sessions conveying
   an MVC bitstream.

   o The RR field MUST be set to '00' (in binary form).  Receivers
   SHOULD ignore the value of RR.

   o If the T bit is equal to 1, the OPTIONAL field DONC MUST be
   present and specified as below. Otherwise, the field DONC MUST NOT
   be present.

   o The P bit MUST be set to 1 if all the remaining NAL units in the
   aggregation packet are with redundant_pic_cnt higher than 0, i.e.

   the slices are redundant slices.  Otherwise, the P bit MUST be set
   to 0.

      Informative note: The P bit indicates whether the packet can be
      discarded because it contains only redundant slice NAL units.
      Without this bit, the corresponding information can be concluded
      from the syntax element redundant_pic_cnt, which is buried in the
      variable-length coded slice header.

   o The C bit MUST be set to 1 if the target NAL units belong to an
   access unit for which the view components are intra coded.
   Otherwise, the C bit MUST be set to 0.  The C bit SHOULD be
   identical for all the PACSI NAL units for which the target NAL units
   belong to the same access unit.

      Informative note: The C bit indicates whether the packet contains
      intra slices which may be the only packets to be forwarded for a
      fast forward playback, e.g. when the network condition is
      extremely bad.

   o The S bit MUST be set to 1, if the first VCL NAL unit, in
   transmission order, of the view component containing the first NAL
   unit following the PACSI NAL unit in the aggregation packet is
   present in the aggregation packet.  Otherwise, the S bit MUST be set
   to 0.

   o The E bit MUST be set to 1, if the last VCL NAL unit, in
   transmission order, of the view component containing the first NAL
   unit following the PACSI NAL unit in the aggregation packet is
   present in the aggregation packet.  Otherwise, the E field MUST be
   set to 0.

      Informative note: The S or E bit indicates whether the first or
      last slice, in transmission order, of a view component is in the
      packet, to enable a MANE to detect slice loss and take proper
      action such as requesting a retransmission as soon as possible,
      as well as to allow an efficient playout buffer handling
      similarly as the M bit in the RTP header.  The M bit in the RTP
      header still indicates the end of an access unit, not the end of
      a view component.

   o The RRR field MUST be set to '00000000'(in binary form).
   Receivers SHOULD ignore the value of RRR.

   o When present, the field DONC indicates the CL-DON value for the
   first NAL unit in the STAP-A in transmission order.

   SEI NAL units included in the PACSI NAL unit, if any, MUST contain a
   subset of the SEI messages associated with the access unit of the
   first NAL unit following the PACSI NAL unit within the aggregation
   packet.

      Informative note: Senders may repeat such SEI NAL units in the
      PACSI NAL unit the presence of which in more than one packet is
      essential for packet loss robustness.  Receivers may use the
      repeated SEI messages in place of missing SEI messages.

   An SEI message SHOULD NOT be included in a PACSI NAL unit and
   included in one of the remaining NAL units contained in the same
   aggregation packet.

   This section will address the issues of section 4.7.1 of [RFC6190].

4.9. Cross-Session DON (CS-DON) for Multi-Session Transmission

   This section will address the issues of section 4.11 of [RFC6190].

5. Packetization Rules

   [Ed.Note(TS): We need to adjust this section with respect to
   [RFC6190].]

   Section 6 of [RFC6184] applies.  The following rules apply in
   addition.

   All receivers MUST support the single NAL unit packetization mode to
   provide backward compatibility to endpoints supporting only the
   single NAL unit mode of RFC 3984.  However, the single NAL unit
   packetization mode SHOULD NOT be used whenever possible, because
   encapsulating NAL units of small sizes, e.g. small NAL units
   containing parameter sets, SEI messages or prefix NAL units, in
   their own packets is typically less efficient because of the
   relatively big overhead.

   All receivers MUST support the non-interleaved packetization mode.

      Informative note: The non-interleaved mode allows an application
      to encapsulate a single NAL unit in a single RTP packet.
      Historically, the single NAL unit mode has been included into
      [RFC6184] only for compatibility with ITU-T Rec. H.241 Annex A
      [H.241].  There is no point in carrying this historic ballast
      towards a new application space such as the one provided with


Wang et al            Expires December 25, 2012               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft     RTP Payload Format for MVC Video           June 2012


      MVC.  More technically speaking, the implementation complexity
      increase for providing the additional mechanisms of the non-
      interleaved mode (namely STAP-A and FU-A) is minor, and the
      benefits are great, that STAP-A implementation is required.

   A NAL unit of small size SHOULD be encapsulated in an aggregation
   packet together with one or more other NAL units. For example, non-
   VCL NAL units such as access unit delimiter, parameter set, or SEI
   NAL unit are typically small.

   A prefix NAL unit SHOULD be aggregated to the same packet as the
   associated NAL unit following the prefix NAL unit in decoding order.

   When the first aggregation unit of an aggregation packet contains a
   PACSI NAL unit, there MUST be at least one additional aggregation
   unit present in the same packet.

   When an MVC bitstream is transported in more than one RTP session,
   the following applies.

   o Interleaved mode SHOULD be used for all the RTP sessions.

   o An RTP session that does not use interleaved mode SHOULD be
   constrained as follows.

     - Non-interleaved mode MUST be used.

     - STAP-A MUST be used, and any other type of packets MUST NOT be
   used.

     - Each STAP-A MUST contain a PACSI NAL unit and the DONC field
   MUST be present in the PACSI NAL unit.

      Informative note: The motivation for these constraints is to
      allow the use of non-interleaved mode for the session conveying
      the H.264/AVC compatible view, such that RFC 3984 receivers
      without interleaved mode implementation can subscribe to the base
      view session.

   Non-VCL NAL units SHOULD be conveyed in the same session as the
   associated VCL NAL units.  To meet this, SEI messages that are
   contained in scalable nesting SEI message and are applicable to more
   than one session SHOULD be separated and contained into multiple
   scalable nesting SEI messages.  The DON values MUST indicate the
   cross-layer decoding order number values as if all these SEI
   messages were in separate scalable nesting SEI messages and

   contained in the beginning of the corresponding access units as
   specified in [H.264].

6. De-Packetization Process (Informative)

   For a single RTP session, the de-packetization process specified in
   section 7 of [RFC6184] applies.

   For receiving more than one of multiple RTP sessions conveying a
   scalable bitstream, an example of a suitable implementation of the
   de-packetization process is to be specified similarly as what will
   be finally included in [RFC6190].

7. Payload Format Parameters

   This section specifies the parameters that MAY be used to select
   optional features of the payload format and certain features of the
   bitstream.  The parameters are specified here as part of the media
   type registration for the MVC codec.  A mapping of the parameters
   into the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is also
   provided for applications that use SDP.  Equivalent parameters could
   be defined elsewhere for use with control protocols that do not use
   SDP.

7.1. Media Type Registration

   The media subtype for the MVC codec is allocated from the IETF tree.

   The receiver MUST ignore any unspecified parameter.

      Informative note: Requiring ignoring unspecified parameter allows
      for backward compatibility of future extensions.  For example, if
      a future specification that is backward compatible to this
      specification specifies some new parameters, then a receiver
      according to this specification is capable of receiving data per
      the new payload but ignoring those parameters newly specified in
      the new payload specification.  This sentence is also present in
      RFC 3984.

   Media Type name:     video

   Media subtype name:  H264-MVC

   The media subtype "H264" MUST be used for RTP streams using RFC
   3984, i.e. not using any of the new features introduced by this
   specification compared to RFC 3984.  For RTP streams using any of
   the new features introduced by this specification compared to RFC

   3984, the media subtype "H264-MVC" SHOULD be used, and the media
   subtype "H264" MAY be used.  Use of the media subtype "H264" for RTP
   streams using the new features allows for RFC 3984 receivers to
   negotiate and receive H.264/AVC or MVC streams packetized according
   to this specification, but to ignore media parameters and NAL unit
   types it does not recognize.

   Required parameters: none

   OPTIONAL parameters:

      In the following definitions of parameters, "the stream" or "the
      NAL unit stream" refers to all NAL units conveyed in the current
      RTP session in SST, and all NAL units conveyed in the current RTP
      session and all NAL units conveyed in other RTP sessions that the
      current RTP session depends on in MST.

      profile-level-id:

      sprop-view-scalability-info:

         This parameter MAY be used to convey the NAL unit containing
         the view scalability information SEI message as specified in
         Annex H of [H.264].  This parameter MAY be used to signal the
         contained target temporal level and target output views of an
         MVC bitstream.  The parameter MUST NOT be used to indicate
         codec capability in any capability exchange procedure. The
         value of the parameter is the base64 [RFC4648] representation
         of the NAL unit containing the view scalability information
         SEI message.  If present, the NAL unit MUST contain only one
         SEI message that is a view scalability information SEI message.



         This parameter MAY be used in an offering or declarative SDP
         message to indicate what temporal level and output views
         (operation points) can be provided.  A receiver MAY indicate
         its choice of one operation point using the optional media
         type parameter sprop-view-operation-point-id.



      sprop-view-operation-point-id:

         This parameter MAY be used to signal a receiver's choice of
         the offers or declared operation points using sprop-view-
         scalability-info or sprop-view-operation-point-info.  The

         value of sprop-view-operation-point-id is a base16
         representation of the operation_point_id[i] syntax element in
         the view scalability information SEI message as specified in
         Annex H of [H.264] or operation-point-ID contained in sprop-
         view-operation-point-info.



      sprop-view-operation-point-info

         This parameter MAY be used to describe the operation points of
         an RTP session.  The value of this parameter consists of a
         comma-separated list of view-operation-point-description
         vector. The values given by the view-operation-point-
         description vectors are the same as, or are derived from, the
         values that would be given for an operation point in the view
         scalability information SEI message as specified in Annex H of
         [H.264], where the term operation point in the view
         scalability information SEI message refers to those NAL units
         required for a valid bitstream to represent a certain subset
         of views at a certain temporal level. An operation point is
         described by the view_id values of the subset of views, and
         the highest temporal_id.

         Each view-operation-point-description vector has variable
         number (depends on the number of view-IDs) of elements,
         provided as a comma-separated list of values as defined below.
         The first value of the view-operation-point-description vector
         is preceded by a '<', and the last value of the view-
         operation-point-description vector is followed by a '>'.  If
         the sprop-view-operation-point-info is followed by exactly one
         view-operation-point-description vector, this describes the
         highest operation point contained in the RTP session.  If
         there are two or more view-operation-point-description
         vectors, the first describes the lowest and the last describes
         the highest operation point contained in the RTP session.

         The values given by the operation-point-description vector are
         as follows, in the order listed:

         - operation-point-ID: This value specifies the identifier of
            the operation point, which is identical to the
            operation_opint_id that would be indicated (for the same
            values of a list of views and the highst temporal_id) in
            the view scalability information SEI message.  This field
            MAY be empty, indicating that the value is unspecified.

            vectors with operation-point-ID, the values of operation-
            point-ID do not need to be consecutive.

         - temporal-ID: This value specifies the maximum value of
            temporal_id of the NAL units in the represntaiton of the
            current operation point.

         - num-target-output-views-minus1: This value plus 1 specifies
            the number of target output views for the current operation
            point.

         - view-ID: each of this parameter specifies the identifier of
            a target output view for the current operation point. The
            number of this parameter depends on num-target-output-
            views-minus1.

         - profile-level-ID: This value specifies the profile-level-
            idc of the operation point in the base16 format. The
            default sub-profile or default level indicated by the
            parameter profile-level-ID in the sprop-view-operation-
            point-info vector SHALL be equal to or lower than the
            default sub-profile or default level indicated by profile-
            level-id, which may be either present or the default value
            is taken. This field MAY be empty, indicating that the
            value is unspecified.

         - avg_bitrate: This value specifies the average bit rate of
            the representation of the current operation point. This
            parameter is given as an integer in kbits per second over
            the entire stream.  Note that this parameter is provided in
            the view scalability information SEI message in bits per
            second and calculated over a variable time window.  This
            field MAY be empty, indicating that the value is
            unspecified.

         - max_bitrate: This value specifies the maximum bitrate of
            the operation point.  This parameter is given as an integer
            in kbits per second and describes the maximum bitrate per
            each one-second window.  Note that this parameter is
            provided in the view scalability information SEI message in
            bits per second and is calculated over a variable time
            window.  This field MAY be empty, indicating that the value
            is unspecified.

         - avg_frm_rate: This value specifies the average frame rate
            of the operation point.  This value is given as an integer

            in frames per 256 seconds.  The field MAY be empty,
            indicating that the value is unspecified.



            Similarly to sprop-view-scalability-info, this parameter
            MAY be used in an offering or declarative SDP message to
            indicate what temporal level and output views (operation
            points) can be provided.  A receiver MAY indicate its
            choice of the highest layer it wants to send and/or receive
            using the optional media type parameter sprop-view-
            operation-point-id.

7.2. SDP Parameters

7.2.1. Mapping of Payload Type Parameters to SDP

   The media type video/H264-MVC string is mapped to fields in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) as follows:

   The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be video.

   The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be H264-MVC
   (the   media subtype).

   The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 90000.

   The OPTIONAL parameters, when present, MUST be included in the
   "a=fmtp" line of SDP.  These parameters are expressed as a media
   type string, in the form of a semicolon separated list of
   parameter=value pairs.

7.2.2. Usage with the SDP Offer/Answer Model

   TBD.

7.2.3. Usage with Multi-Session Transmission

   If multi-session transmission is used, the rules on signaling media
   decoding dependency in SDP as defined in
   [RFC5583] apply.

7.2.4. Usage in Declarative Session Descriptions

   TBD.

7.3. Examples

   TBD.

7.4. Parameter Set Considerations

   Please see section 10 of [RFC6184].

8. Security Considerations

   Please see section 11 of [RFC6184].

13. Open Issues

   - The use of CL-DON for session reordering allows also for
     interleaved transmission with non-interleaved packetization mode.
     There should be a clear separation between both tools.  This issue
     should be handled the same way as for the SVC payload draft.

   - Since SVC session multiplexing (multi source transmission(MST)) is
     cleared, it would be great to just reference the MST sections in
     [RFC6190]. Since the text in sections 6 and 7 of [RFC6190] is
     currently very SVC specific, the authors would have to try to
     rewrite these sections in a more generic way. If this is not
     possible, we need to copy text from [RFC6190] with respect to MVC.

   - The structure of this document should be aligned with recently
     finished RFC6190.

   - This document is not intended to be a delta document in respect to
     RFC6190.

   - The PASCI definition in this document differs from the definition
     in RFC6190
