Abstract

   Real time communcation Web (RTCWeb) workgroup defines the real time
   commmunication using JavaScript Session establishment protocol (JSEP)
   as an offer/answer mechanism.  Session Initiation protocol (SIP) is
   IETF defined and well deployed protocol for real time communication.
   This document provides offer & answer interworking between JSEP and
   SIP.

Internet-Draft     O/A Interworking between JSEP & SIP         June 2013


1.  Introduction

   Real time communcation Web (RTCWeb) workgroup defines JavaScript
   Session establishment protocol (JSEP) [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-jsep] as an
   offer/answer mechanism.  The transport to carry JSEP information
   shall be HTTP long polling [RFC6202]  or WebSockets over TLS/TCP
   [RFC6455].  JSEP Offer/answer details shall be carried based on the
   application choice and some of the possible mechanism are REST or SIP
   or XMPP.  HTTP based transport mechanism has the advantages of
   travering through all NAT and firewall.  JSEP offer/answer focuses on
   the offer/answer between two browsers wherein the offer/answer
   related feature like parallel forking in SIP is not provided.

   Session Initiation protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] is IETF defined and well
   deployed protocol for real time communication.  SIP offer/answer
   mechanism is based on [RFC3264] and few enhancements are done in the
   SIP layer.

   RTCWeb clients (browser) and SIP UA supports Session Description
   protocol (SDP)[RFC4566] as the media description protocol.  In case
   of mapping between these two protocols, SDP shall be reused.

   SIP offer/answer supports the different RTP models [RFC3550] like RTP
   endpoint, RTP Mixer, RTP translator whereas JSEP supports RTP
   endpoint only.

   As there are difference betweeen SIP offer/answer and JSEP, there is
   a need of explicit mapping.  This document provides the mapping
   between JSEP and SIP offer/answer mechanism.  This mapping happens
   between SIP UA and RTCWeb entity which handles JSEP.  RTCWeb entity
   in this document refers to the RTCWeb compliant browser or RTCWeb
   Server.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs."


3.  Definitions
   o  RTCWeb entity : RTCWeb compliant browser or RTCWeb Server.
   o  18x response: 180 (ringing) or 183 (session progress) or any other
      response in the range of 180-189

4.  SIP and JSEP offer/answer mapping architecture

   The mapping between SIP and JSEP offer/answer is the building block
   described in this document.  This mapping happens between SIP UA and
   RTCWeb entity which handles JSEP.  RTCWeb entity in this document
   refers to the RTCWeb compliant browser or RTCWeb Server.  The
   following diagrams illustrate the possible JSEP-SIP mapping
   architecture.

            Fig 1:  JSEP-SIP mapping in RTCWeb Server


   In the above figure 1, JSEP-SIP mapping is done at RTCWeb server.
   JSEP shall be transported from RTCWeb browser to RTCWeb Server by any
   signaling mechanism


                              SIP
   RTCWeb Browser + SIP UA<----------->RTCWeb Server + SIP UA/Proxy

            Fig 2:  JSEP-SIP mapping in RTCWeb browser


   JSEP-SIP mapping shall be done at RTCWeb browser as shown in the
   above diagram.  SIP shall be transported from RTCWeb browser to
   RTCWeb Server by SIP over WebSocket or any other signaling mechanism


5.  JSEP offer/answer to SIP offer/answer mapping

5.1.  Basic JSEP session mapping

   In RTCWeb browser, ICE is mandatorily supported.  ICE calls for two
   offer/answer exchange wherein the initial offer indicates the set of
   ICE candidate pairs and the second offer/answer confirms the
   candidate pair which is used for the session.  JSEP OFFER SHALL be
   mapped to INVITE with SDP and 200 OK with SDP SHALL be mapped to JSEP
   ANSWER.

5.2.  Early media mapping

   In SIP, early dialog is established using PRACK [RFC3262] method and
   ICE negotiation (OFFER2) is triggered by UPDATE method [RFC3311]
   towards SIP UA. 18x (18x/183) response with SDP triggers the early
   media.  SDP 200 for INVITE with Answer2 SHALLL be ignored towards
   JSEP side as the answer2 is forwarded as part of 200 for UPDATE with
   Answer2.

5.4.  Offer JSEP- SIP Offer Race condition handling

   It is possible for offer to be send by RTCWeb browser and SIP UA
   during the middle of the session.  In [RFC3262], these race
   conditions are resolved using 491 response as shown below.

5.5.  JSEP to SIP serial forking

   In case of SIP serial forking with ICE exchange, second offer MAY be
   required in case the candidate pair is changing from the default
   during the early dialog and such earlier dialog offer/answer exchange
   has to happen in dialog1 using UPDATE mechanism.  When the second
   INVITE is forked from proxy towards the UA3, the final response 200
   OK from UA3 is received with different SDP as Answer3.  Answer3 has
   to be mapped as Offer 3 towards JSEP in JSEP-SIP gateway as JSEP
   completed offer-answer exchange already.  Also, PRANSWER state in
   JSEP is not used as OFFER2 with ICE update is not possible within
   PRANSWER state.  ANSWER4 SDP is same as ANSWER2, RE-INVITE towards UA
   shall be optimized or else RE-INVITE MUST be exchanged between JSEP-
   SIP GW to SIP-UA.

   Fig 7:  Serial Forking JSEP to SIP session mapping


   The assumption in Fig 5 is that ANSWER2 and ANSWER4 are same.  In
   case they are different, there is a need of extra offer-answer
   between JSEP-SIP GW and SIP UA3

5.6.  JSEP to SIP Parallel forking

   JSEP does not support SIP parallel forking currently and it is the
   application responsibility to achieve the same.  As JSEP-SIPGW is the
   application in this document, SIP parallel forking SHALL be achieved
   as shown below.  The point to be noted is that only one active RTP
   stream is possible in JSEP side and so, the other active RTP stream
   is updated as inactive using UPDATE offer/answer as shown in offer4.
   The rest of the callflow for parallel forking is same as SIP serial
   forking handling.

   Fig 8:  Parallel Forking JSEP to SIP session mapping



6.  SIP offer/answer to JSEP offer/answer mapping

   SIP specific offer/answer mechanism is defined in [RFC3261].

6.1.  Basic SIP-JSEP session mapping

   INVITE with SDP offer is the first message in SIP which maps to JSEP
   Offer.  The user alert information is not part of JSEP, HTTP
   application specific extension shall indicate the user alert status
   to the interworking entity which shall be later mapped to 18x mapping

Internet-Draft     O/A Interworking between JSEP & SIP         June 2013


   without SDP.  When RTCWeb user accepts the session, JSEP send ANSWER
   towards interworking entity and ANSWER will be mapped to 200 OK
   message in SIP.

6.2.  INVITE without SDP Offer to JSEP session mapping

   It is possible in SIP that INVITE without SDP offer is the first
   message in SIP which has to initiate JSEP Offer from the client side.
   The mechanism by which JSEP offer initiate request between
   interworking entity and JSEP entity is outside the scope of the
   document.  Once the JSEP offer is received in the interworking
   entity, it will be to 183 with offer towards UAC.  PRACK with SDP
   answer is received,

6.3.  SIP Non-ICE to JSEP ICE handling

   SIP does not mandate for ICE [RFC5245] whereas JSEP in RTCWeb has to
   have mandatorily ICE handling.  So, SIP-JSEP interworking entity has
   to make sure ICE to non-ICE handling as well as SDP specific changes
   for these interworking.

6.4.  JSEP ICE to SIP Non-ICE handling

   Most of the deployed SIP devices does not support ICE whereas JSEP in
   RTCWeb always requires ICE.  So, the interworking JSEP ICE to SIP
   Non-ICE has to be handled in case JSEP-SIP gateway.  This document
   does not mandates the mechanism for this interworking but provides
   one of the possible solution wherein ICE exchange is handled by JSEP-
   SIP GW and here how JSEP-SIP Gateway identify SIP UA does not support
   ICE is outside the scope of this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration of SIP UA and JSEP MUST be considered for
   the interworking functionality.  There is no need of any other extra
   security considerations for this document.


8.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA considerations for this draft.
