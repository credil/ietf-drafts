Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for STUN              October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Traversal Utilities
   for NAT (STUN) protocol.

   STUN is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in
   dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  It can be
   used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to
   it by a NAT, to perform connectivity checks between two endpoints,
   and used as a keepalive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  RFC 5389
   [RFC5389] defines the specifics of the STUN protocol.

   The 'stun/stuns' URI scheme is used to designate a standalone STUN
   server or any Internet host performing the operations of a STUN
   server in the context of STUN usages (Section 14 RFC 5389 [RFC5389]).
   With the advent of standards such as WEBRTC [WEBRTC], we anticipate a
   plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to identify and
   communicate with such a STUN server to carry out the STUN protocol.
   This also implies those endpoints and/or applications to be
   provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify the
   STUN server.  Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and can
   result in non-interoperable solutions.  It can result in solutions
   that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on the
   different aspects of the syntax and alike.  The 'stun/stuns' URI
   scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent
   way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a
   STUN server.  This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with
   encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones
   proposed in the WEBRTC Standards [WEBRTC], for example.

   The 'stun/stuns' URI scheme adheres to the generic syntax defined in
   RFC 3986 [RFC3986].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  URI Scheme Definition

3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The 'stun/stuns' URI takes the following form (the syntax below is
   non-normative):

Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for STUN              October 2011


      stun:<userinfo>@<host>:<port>

      stuns:<userinfo>@<host>:<port>

   Where <userinfo> with the "@" (at) sign character, as well as the
   <port> part and the preceding ":" (colon) character, is OPTIONAL.

   The normative syntax of the 'stun' URI is defined as shown in the
   following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]. rule:

   stun-uri      = stun-scheme ":" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
   stun-scheme   = "stun"/"stuns"
   userinfo      = user
   user          = 1*(%x21-24 / %x26-39 / %x3B-3F / %x41-7F
                   / escaped)
                       ; The symbols "%", ":", "@", and symbols
                       ; with a character value below 0x21 may
                       ; be represented as escaped sequences.
   host          = hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
   hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
   domainlabel   = alphanum / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
   toplabel      = ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
   IPv4address   = 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
   IPv6reference = "[" IPv6address "]"
   IPv6address   = hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
   hexpart       = hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
   hexseq        = hex4 *( ":" hex4 )
   hex4          = 1*4HEXDIG
   port          = 1*DIGIT
   alphanum      = ALPHA / DIGIT
   escaped       = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

   The current ABNF proposal doesn't specify a mechanism for handling
   different transports.  We have identified a possible solution and
   will be included in the future version of the draft.

   The <host>, <port> and <userinfo> rules are described in Appendix A
   of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  The core rules <ALPHA>, <DIGIT> and
   <HEXDIGIT> are used as described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The STUN protocol supports sending messages over UDP, TCP or TLS-
   over-TCP.  The 'stuns' URI scheme SHALL be used when STUN is run over
   TLS-over-TCP (or DTLS-over-UDP in the future) and the 'stun' scheme
   SHALL be used otherwise.  The <host> part of the 'stun' URI, which is
   REQUIRED, denotes the STUN server host.  The <userinfo> part is
   OPTIONAL and MAY NOT be utilized within the 'stun/stuns' URI scheme.

   It is provided so as to be compatible with certain non-standard
   standalone STUN server implementations that enforce clients to
   authenticate.  The <port> part, if present,denotes the port on which
   the STUN server is awaiting connection requests.  For a standalone
   STUN server the port SHALL default to 3478 for both UDP and TCP.  The
   default port for TLS SHALL be 5349.


4.  Examples

   URI identifying a STUN Server at example.com listening on port 1234:

      stun:example.com:1234

   A URI to identify a STUN server at example.com listening on the
   default TLS port 5349:

      stuns:example.com

   URI to identify a short-term or a long-term credential for the
   connection to STUN server, example.com, on port 1234:

      stun:username:password@example.com:1234


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document instructs IANA to register the 'stun' and 'stuns' URI
   schemes in the "Permanent URI Schemes" sub-registry in the "Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes" IANA registry [URIREG].  These
   registrations follows the URI Scheme Registration Template detailed
   in Section 5.4 of RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

5.1.  The 'stun' URI Scheme Registration

   IANA registration of the the 'stun' URI scheme:

      URI scheme name: stun

      Status: Permanent

      URI scheme syntax: see Section 3.1 of RFC XXXX [This document]

      URI scheme semantics: see Section 3.2 of RFC XXXX [This document]

      URI scheme encoding considerations: there are no other encoding
      considerations for 'stun' URIs that are not described in RFC 5389
      [RFC5389].

6.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

   The URI Scheme defined by this document for the Session Traversal
   Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol does not introduce any security
   considerations beyond those detailed in Section 16 of RFC 5389
   [RFC5389].

   The STUN protocol supports two opional credential mechanisms as
   described in the Section 10 of RFC 5389 [RFC5389].  For the short-
   term credential mechanism (Section 10.1 of RFC 5389 [RFC5389]), the
   security of such a credential SHALL be the responsibility of the STUN
   usage mechanism, say ICE (RFC 5245 [RFC5245]).  For the long-term
   credential mechanism (Section 10.2 of RFC 5389 [RFC5389]), such a
   credential MUST be passed over a secure transport such as HTTPS (RFC
   2818 [RFC2818]).

   Many thanks to Cullen Jennings for his detailed review and thoughtful
   comments on this document.

   We acknowledge the existence of
   draft-petithuguenin-behave-turn-uri-bis-04 document as a parallel
   effort in defining the URI scheme for TURN.  Awareness of this draft
   came late in the process and we have not had to time to reach out to
   the author of that memo and discuss opportunities to collaborate on a
   single document.  It is our intentions to do so.
