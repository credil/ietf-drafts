      <t>The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion of the
      potential problems of using private, RFC1918, or non-globally-routable
      addressing within the core of an SP network. The discussion focuses on
      link addresses and to a small extent loopback addresses. While many of
      the issues are well recognised within the ISP community, there appears
      to be no document that collectively describes the issues.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>In the mid to late 90's, some Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
      adopted the practice of utilising private (or non-globally unique) <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> IP addresses for the infrastructure links and
      in some cases the loopback interfaces within their networks. The reasons
      for this approach centered on conservation of address space (i.e.
      scarcity of public IPv4 address space), and security of the core network
      (also known as core hiding).</t>

      <t>However, a number of technical and operational issues occurred as a
      result of using private (or non-globally unique) IP addresses, and
      virtually all these ISPs moved away from the practice. Tier 1 ISPs are
      considered the benchmark of the industry and as of the time of writing,
      there is no known tier 1 ISP that utilises the practice of private
      addressing within their core network.</t>

      <t>The following sections will discuss the various issues associated
      with deploying private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> IP addresses
      within ISP core networks.</t>

      <t>The intent of this document is not to suggest that private IP can not
      be used with the core of an SP network as some providers use this
      practice and operate successfully. The intent is to outline the
      potential issues or effects of such a practice.</t>

      <t>Note: The practice of ISPs using ‘stolen’ address space (also known
      as 'squat' space) has many of the same issues (or effects) as that of
      using private IP address space within core networks. The term “stolen IP
      address space” refers to the practice of an ISP using address space for
      its own infrastructure/core network addressing that has been officially
      allocated by an RIR to another provider, but that provider is not
      currently using or advertising within the Internet. Stolen addressing is
      not discussed further in this document. It is simply noted as an
      associated issue.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conservation of Address Space">
      <t>One of the original intents for the use of private IP addressing
      within an ISP core was the conservation of IP address space. When an ISP
      is allocated a block of public IP addresses (from a RIR), this address
      block was traditionally split in order to dedicate some portion for
      infrastructure use (i.e. for the core network), and the other portion
      for customer (subscriber) or other address pool use. Typically, the
      number of infrastructure addresses needed is relatively small in
      comparison to the total address count. So unless the ISP was only
      granted a small public block, dedicating some portion to infrastructure
      links and loopback addresses (/32) is rarely a large enough issue to
      outweigh the problems that are potentially caused when private address
      space is used.</t>

      <t>Additionally, specifications and equipment capability improvements
      now allow for the use of /31 subnets <xref target="RFC3021"></xref> for
      link addresses in place of the original /30 subnets – further minimising
      the impact of dedicating public addresses to infrastructure links by
      only using two (2) IP addresses per point to point link versus four (4)
      respectively.</t>

      <t>The use of private addressing as a conservation technique within an
      Internet Service Provider (ISP) core can cause a number of technical and
      operational issues or effects. The main effects are described below.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Effects on Traceroute">
      <t>The single biggest effect caused by the use of private <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> addressing within an Internet core is the fact
      that it can disrupt the operation of traceroute in some situations. This
      section provides some examples of the issues that can occur.</t>

      <t>A first example illustrates the situation where the traceroute
      crosses an AS boundary and one of the networks has utilised private
      addressing. The following simple network is used to show the
      effects.</t>

      <t>Using this example, performing the traceroute from AS64497 to
      AS64496, we can see the private addresses of the infrastructure links in
      AS64496 are returned.</t>

      <t>This effect in itself is often not a problem. However, if
      anti-spoofing controls are applied at network perimeters, then responses
      returned from hops with private IP addresses will be dropped.
      Anti-spoofing refers to a security control where traffic with an invalid
      source address is discarded. Anti-spoofing is further described in <xref
      target="BCP38"></xref>/<xref target="RFC2827"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The effects are illustrated in a second example below. The same
      network as example 1 is used, but with the addition of anti-spoofing
      deployed at the ingress of R4 on the R3-R4 interface (IP Address
      198.51.100.10).</t>

      <figure>

      </figure>

      <t>In a third example, a similar effect is caused. If a traceroute is
      initiated from a router with a private (source) IP address, located in
      AS64496 and the destination is outside of the ISPs AS (AS64497), then in
      this situation the traceroute will fail completely beyond the AS
      boundary.</t>

      <t>While it is completely unreasonable to expect a packet with a private
      source address to be successfully returned in a typical SP environment,
      the case is included to show the effect as it can have implications for
      troubleshooting. This case will be referenced in a later section.</t>

      <t>In a complex topology, with multiple paths and exit points, the
      provider will lose their ability to trace paths originating within their
      own AS, through their network, to destinations within other ASs. Such a
      situation could be a severe troubleshooting impediment.</t>

      <t>For completeness, a fourth example is included to show that a
      successful traceroute can be achieved by specifying a public source
      address as the source address of the traceroute. Such an approach can be
      used in many operational situations if the router initiating the
      traceroute has at least one public address configured. However, the
      approach is more cumbersome.</t>

      <t>It should be noted that some solutions to this problem have been
      proposed in <xref target="RFC5837"></xref> which provides extensions to
      ICMP to allow the identification of interfaces and their components by
      any combination of the following: ifIndex, IPv4 address, IPv6 address,
      name, and MTU. However at the time of writing, little or no deployment
      was known to be in place.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Effects on Path MTU Discovery">
      <t>The Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) process was designed to allow hosts to
      make an accurate assessment of the maximum packet size that can be sent
      across a path without fragmentation. Path MTU Discovery is supported by
      TCP over IPv4 <xref target="RFC1191"></xref>, TCP over IPv6 <xref
      target="RFC1981"></xref> and some tunneling protocols such as GRE and
      IPSEC.</t>

      <t>The PMTUD mechanism requires that an intermediate router can reply to
      the source address of an IP packet with an ICMP reply which uses the
      router's interface address. If the router's interface address is a
      private IP address, then this ICMP reply packet may be discarded due to
      uRPF or ingress filtering, thereby causing the PMTUD mechanism to fail.
      If the PMTUD mechanism fails, this will cause transmission of data
      between the two hosts to fail silently due to the traffic being
      black-holed. As a result, the potential for application level issues may
      be created.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Unexpected interactions with some NAT implementations">
      <t>Private addressing is legitimately used within many enterprise,
      corporate or government networks for internal network addressing. When
      users on the inside of the network require Internet access, they will
      typically connect through a perimeter router, firewall, or network
      proxy, that provides Network Address Translation (NAT) or Network
      Address Port Translation (NAPT) services to a public interface.</t>

      <t>Scarcity of public IPv4 addresses, and the transition to IPv6, is
      forcing many service providers to make use of NAT. CGN (Carrier Grade
      NAT) will enable service providers to assign private <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> IPv4 addresses to their customers rather than
      public, globally unique IPv4 addresses. NAT444 will make use of a double
      NAT process.</t>

      <t>Unpredictable or confusing interactions could occur if traffic such
      as traceroute, PMTUD and possibly other applications were launched from
      the NAT IPv4 ‘inside address’ and it passed over the same address range
      in the public IP core. While such a situation would be unlikely to occur
      if the NAT pools and the private infrastructure addressing were under
      the same administration, such a situation could occur in the more
      typical situation of a NAT'ed corporate network connecting to an ISP.
      For example, say if 10.1.1.0/24 is used to internally number the
      corporate network. A traceroute or PMTUD request is initiated inside the
      corporate network from say 10.1.1.1. The packet passes through a NAT (or
      NAPT) gateway, then over an ISP core numbered from the same range. When
      the responses are delivered back to the originator, the returned packets
      from the privately addressed part of the ISP core could have an
      identical source and destination address of 10.1.1.1.</t>

      <t>This overlapping address space configuration is likely to cause
      confusion among operational staff, thereby making it more difficult to
      successfully debug networking problems.</t>

      <t>Certainly a scenario where the same <xref target="RFC1918"></xref>
      address space becomes utilised on both the inside and outside interfaces
      of a NAT/NAPT device can be problematic. For example, the same private
      address range is assigned by both the administrator of a corporate
      network and their ISP. Some applications discover the outside address of
      their local CPE to determine if that address is reserver for special
      use. Application behavior may then be based on this determination. <xref
      target="RFC6598">"IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address
      Space"</xref> provides further analysis of this situation.</t>

      <t>To address this scenario and others, <xref
      target="RFC6598">"IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address
      Space"</xref> requests a dedicated /10 address block for the purpose of
      Shared CGN (Carrier Grade NAT) Address Space. The purpose of Shared CGN
      Address Space is to number CPE (Customer Premise Equipment) interfaces
      that connect to CGN devices. As explained in <xref
      target="RFC6598"></xref>, <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> addressing has
      issues when used in this deployment scenario.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Interactions with edge anti-spoofing techniques">
      <t>Denial of Service Attacks (DOS) and Distributed Denial of Service
      Attacks (DDoS) can make use of spoofed source IP addresses in an attempt
      to obfuscate the source of an attack. <xref target="RFC2827">Network
      Ingress Filtering</xref> strongly recommends that providers of Internet
      connectivity implement filtering to prevent packets using source
      addresses outside of their legitimately assigned and advertised prefix
      ranges. Such filtering should also prevent packets with private source
      addresses from egressing the AS.</t>

      <t>Best security practices for ISPs also strongly recommend that packets
      with illegitimate source addresses should be dropped at the AS
      perimeter. Illegitimate source addresses includes private <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref>IP addresses, addresses within the provider's
      assigned prefix ranges, and bogons (legitimate but unassigned IP
      addresses). Additionally, packets with private IP destination addresses
      should also be dropped at the AS perimeter.</t>

      <t>If such filtering is properly deployed, then traffic either sourced
      from, or destined for privately addressed portions of the network should
      be dropped. Hence the negative consequences on traceroute, PMTUD and
      regular ping type traffic.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Peering using loopbacks">
      <t>Although not a common technique, some ISPs use the loopback addresses
      of border routers (ASBRs) for peering, in particular where multiple
      connections or exchange points exist between the two ISPs. Such a
      technique is used by some ISPs as the foundation of fine grained traffic
      engineering and load balancing through the combination of IGP metrics
      and multi-hop BGP. When private or non-globally reachable addresses are
      used as loopback addresses, this technique is either not possible, or
      considerably more complex to implement.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DNS Interaction">
      <t>Many ISPs utilise their DNS to perform both forward and reverse
      resolution for the infrastructure devices and infrastructure addresses.
      With a privately numbered core, the ISP itself will still have the
      capability to perform name resolution of their own infrastructure.
      However others outside of the autonomous system will not have this
      capability. At best, they will get a number of unidentified <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> IP addresses returned from a traceroute.</t>

      <t>It is also worth noting that in some cases the reverse resolution
      requests may leak outside of the AS. Such a situation can add load to
      public DNS servers. Further information on this problem is documented in
      <xref target="RFC6304">"AS112 Nameserver Operations"</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operational and Troubleshooting issues">
      <t>Previous sections of the document have noted issues relating to
      network operations and troubleshooting. In particular when private IP
      addressing within an ISP core is used, the ability to easily
      troubleshoot across the AS boundary may be limited. In some cases this
      may be a serious troubleshooting impediment. In other cases, it may be
      solved through the use of alternative troubleshooting techniques.</t>

      <t>The key point is that the flexibility of initiating an outbound ping
      or traceroute from a privately numbered section of the network is lost.
      In a complex topology, with multiple paths and exit points from the AS,
      the provider may be restricted in their ability to trace paths through
      the network to other ASs. Such a situation could be a severe
      troubleshooting impediment.</t>

      <t>For users outside of the AS, the loss of the ability to use a
      traceroute for troubleshooting is very often a serious issue. As soon as
      many of these people see a row of "* * *" in a traceroute they often
      incorrectly assume that a large part of the network is down or
      inaccessible (e.g. behind a firewall). Operational experience in many
      large providers has shown that significant confusion can result.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>One of the arguments often put forward for the use of private
      addressing within an ISP is an improvement in the network security. It
      has been argued that if private addressing is used within the core, the
      network infrastructure becomes unreachable from outside the providers
      autonomous system, hence protecting the infrastructure. There is
      legitimacy to this argument. Certainly if the core is privately numbered
      and unreachable, it potentially provides a level of isolation in
      addition to what can be achieved with other techniques, such as
      infrastructure ACLs, on their own. This is especially true in the event
      of an ACL misconfiguration, something that does commonly occur as the
      result of human error.</t>

      <t>There are three key security gaps that exist in a privately addressed
      IP core.<list>
          <t>The approach does not protect against reflection attacks if edge
          anti-spoofing is not deployed. For example, if a packet with spoofed
          source address corresponding to the networks infrastructure address
          range, is sent to a host (or other device) attached to the network,
          that host will send its response directly to the infrastructure
          address. If such an attack was performed across a large number of
          hosts, then a successful large scale denial of service attack on the
          infrastructure could be achieved. This is not to say that a publicly
          numbered core will protect from the same attack, it won’t. The key
          point is that a reflection attack does get around the apparent
          security offered in a privately addressed core.</t>

          <t>Even if anti-spoofing is deployed at the AS boundary, the border
          routers will potentially carry routing information for the privately
          addressed network infrastructure. This can mean that packets with
          spoofed addresses, corresponding to the private infrastructure
          addressing, may be considered legitimate by edge anti-spoofing
          techniques such as Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding – Loose Mode, and
          forwarded. To avoid this situation, an edge anti-spoofing algorithm
          such as Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding – Strict Mode, would be
          required. Strict approaches can be problematic in some environments
          or where asymmetric traffic paths exist.</t>

          <t>The approach on its own does not protect the network
          infrastructure from directly connected customers (i.e. within the
          same AS). Unless other security controls, such as access control
          lists (ACLs), are deployed at the ingress point of the network,
          customer devices will normally be able to reach, and potentially
          attack, both core and edge infrastructure devices.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Alternate approaches to core network security">
      <t>Today, hardware-based ACLs, which have minimal to no performance
      impact, are now widespread. Applying an ACL at the AS perimeter to
      prevent access to the network core may be a far simpler approach and
      provide comparable protection to using private addressing; such a
      technique is known as an infrastructure ACL (iACL).</t>

      <t>In concept, iACLs provide filtering at the edge network which allows
      traffic to cross the network core, but not to terminate on
      infrastructure addresses within the core. Proper iACL deployment will
      normally allow required network management traffic to be passed, such
      that traceroutes and PMTUD can still operate successfully. For an iACL
      deployment to be practical, the core network needs to have been
      addressed with a relatively small number of contiguous address blocks.
      For this reason, the technique may or may not be practical.</t>

      <t>A second approach to preventing external access to the core is IS-IS
      core hiding. This technique makes use of a fundamental property of the
      IS-IS protocol which allows link addresses to be removed from the
      routing table while still allowing loopback addresses to be resolved as
      next hops for BGP. The technique prevents parties outside the AS from
      being able to route to infrastructure addresses, while still allowing
      traceroutes to operate successfully. IS-IS core hiding does not have the
      same practical requirement for the core to be addressed from a small
      number of contiguous address blocks as with iACLs. From an operational
      and troubleshooting perspective, care must be taken to ensure that pings
      and traceroutes are using source and destination addresses that exist in
      the routing tables of all routers in the path. i.e. Not hidden link
      addresses.</t>

      <t>A third approach is the use of either an MPLS based IP VPN, or an
      MPLS based IP Core where the 'P' routers (or Label Switch Routers) do
      not carry global routing information. As the core 'P' routers (or Label
      Switch Routers) are only switching labeled traffic, they are effectively
      not reachable from outside of the MPLS domain. The 'P' routers can
      optionally be hidden such they do not appear in a traceroute. While this
      approach isolates the 'P' routers from directed attacks, it does not
      protect the edge routers - being either a 'PE' router or a Label Edge
      Router (LER). Obviously there are numerous other engineering
      considerations in such an approach, we simply note it as an option.</t>

      <t>These techniques may not be suitable for every network, however,
      there are many circumstances where they can be used successfully without
      the associated effects of a privately addressing the core.</t>
