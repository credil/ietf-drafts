Internet-Draft                 WebDAV Sync                  January 2012


1.  Introduction

   WebDAV [RFC4918] defines the concept of 'collections' which are
   hierarchical groupings of WebDAV resources on an HTTP [RFC2616]
   server.  Collections can be of arbitrary size and depth (i.e.,
   collections within collections).  WebDAV clients that cache resource
   content need a way to synchronize that data with the server (i.e.,
   detect what has changed and update their cache).  This can currently
   be done using a WebDAV PROPFIND request on a collection to list all
   members of a collection along with their DAV:getetag property values,
   which allows the client to determine which were changed, added or
   deleted.  However, this does not scale well to large collections as
   the XML response to the PROPFIND request will grow with the
   collection size.

   This specification defines a new WebDAV report that results in the
   server returning to the client only information about those member
   URLs that were added or deleted, or whose mapped resources were
   changed, since a previous execution of the report on the collection.

   Additionally, a new property is added to collection resources that is
   used to convey a "synchronization token" that is guaranteed to change
   when the collection's member URLs or their mapped resources have
   changed.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses XML DTD fragments ([W3C.REC-xml-20081126], Section
   3.2) as a purely notational convention.  WebDAV request and response
   bodies cannot be validated by a DTD due to the specific extensibility
   rules defined in Section 17 of [RFC4918] and due to the fact that all
   XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace name
   "DAV:".  In particular:

   1.  element names use the "DAV:" namespace,

   2.  element ordering is irrelevant unless explicitly stated,

   3.  extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child
       elements) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated
       otherwise,

   4.  extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for
       this element) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly

       stated otherwise.

   When an XML element type in the "DAV:" namespace is referenced in
   this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string
   "DAV:" will be prefixed to the element type.

   This document inherits, and sometimes extends, DTD productions from
   Section 14 of [RFC4918].

3.  WebDAV Synchronization

3.1.  Overview

   One way to synchronize data between two entities is to use some form
   of synchronization token.  The token defines the state of the data
   being synchronized at a particular point in time.  It can then be
   used to determine what has changed between one point in time and
   another.

   This specification defines a new WebDAV report that is used to enable
   client-server collection synchronization based on such a token.

   In order to synchronize the contents of a collection between a server
   and client, the server provides the client with a synchronization
   token each time the synchronization report is executed.  That token
   represents the state of the data being synchronized at that point in
   time.  The client can then present that same token back to the server
   at some later time and the server will return only those items that
   are new, have changed or were deleted since that token was generated.
   The server also returns a new token representing the new state at the
   time the report was run.

   Typically, the first time a client connects to the server it will
   need to be informed of the entire state of the collection (i.e., a
   full list of all member URLs that are currently in the collection).
   That is done by the client sending an empty token value to the
   server.  This indicates to the server that a full listing is
   required.

   As an alternative, the client might choose to do its first
   synchronization using some other mechanism on the collection (e.g.
   some other form of batch resource information retrieval such as
   PROPFIND, SEARCH [RFC5323] , or specialized REPORTs such as those
   defined in CalDAV [RFC4791] and CardDAV [RFC6352]) and ask for the
   DAV:sync-token property to be returned.  This property (defined in
   Section 4) contains the same token that can be used later on to issue
   a DAV:sync-collection report.

   In some cases a server might only wish to maintain a limited amount
   of history about changes to a collection.  In that situation it will
   return an error to the client when the client presents a token that
   is "out of date".  At that point the client has to fall back to
   synchronizing the entire collection by re-running the report request
   using an empty token value.

   Typically, a client will use the synchronization report to retrieve
   the list of changes, and will follow that with requests to retrieve
   the content of changed resources.  It is possible that additional
   changes to the collection could occur between the time of the
   synchronization report and resource content retrieval, which could
   result in an inconsistent view of the collection.  When clients use
   this method of synchronization, they need to be aware that such
   additional changes could occur, and track them, e.g., by differences
   between the ETag values returned in the synchronization report and
   those returned when actually fetching resource content, by using
   conditional requests as described in Section 5, or repeating the
   synchronization process until no changes are returned.

3.2.  DAV:sync-collection Report

   If the DAV:sync-collection report is implemented by a WebDAV server,
   then the server MUST list the report in the "DAV:supported-report-
   set" property on any collection supporting synchronization.

   To implement the behavior for this report a server needs to keep
   track of changes to any member URLs and their mapped resources in a
   collection (as defined in Section 3 of [RFC4918]).  This includes
   noting the addition of new member URLs, changes to the mapped
   resources of existing member URLs, and removal of member URLs.  The
   server will track each change and provide a synchronization "token"
   to the client that describes the state of the server at a specific
   point in time.  This "token" is returned as part of the response to
   the "sync-collection" report.  Clients include the last token they
   got from the server in the next "sync-collection" report that they
   execute and the server provides the changes from the previous state,
   represented by the token, to the current state, represented by the
   new token returned.

   The synchronization token itself MUST be treated as an "opaque"
   string by the client - i.e., the actual string data has no specific
   meaning or syntax.  However, the token MUST be a valid URI to allow
   its use in an If pre-condition request header (see Section 5).  For
   example, a simple implementation of such a token could be a numeric
   counter that counts each change as it occurs and relates that change
   to the specific object that changed.  The numeric value could be
   appended to a "base" URI to form the valid sync-token.

   Marshalling:

      The request URI MUST identify a collection.  The request body MUST
      be a DAV:sync-collection XML element (see Section 6.1), which MUST
      contain one DAV:sync-token XML element, one DAV:sync-level
      element, and one DAV:prop XML element, and MAY contain a DAV:limit
      XML element.

      This report is only defined when the Depth header has value "0";
      other values result in a 400 (Bad Request) error response.  Note
      that [RFC3253], Section 3.6, states that if the Depth header is
      not present, it defaults to a value of "0".

      The response body for a successful request MUST be a DAV:
      multistatus XML element, which MUST contain one DAV:sync-token
      element in addition to one DAV:response element for each member
      URL that was added, has had its mapped resource changed, or was
      deleted since the last synchronization operation as specified by
      the DAV:sync-token provided in the request.  A given member URL
      MUST appear only once in the response.  In the case where multiple
      member URLs of the request-URI are mapped to the same resource, if
      the resource is changed, each member URL MUST be returned in the
      response.

      The content of each DAV:response element differs depending on how
      the member was altered:

         For members that have changed (i.e., are new or have had their
         mapped resource modified) the DAV:response MUST contain at
         least one DAV:propstat element and MUST NOT contain any DAV:
         status element.

         For members that have been removed, the DAV:response MUST
         contain one DAV:status with a value set to '404 Not Found' and
         MUST NOT contain any DAV:propstat element.

         For members that are collections and are unable to support the
         DAV:sync-collection report, the DAV:response MUST contain one
         DAV:status with a value set to '403 Forbidden', a DAV:error
         containing DAV:supported-report or DAV:sync-traversal-supported
         (see Section 3.3 for which is appropriate), and MUST NOT
         contain any DAV:propstat element.

      The conditions under which each type of change can occur is
      further described in Section 3.5.

   Preconditions:

      (DAV:valid-sync-token): The DAV:sync-token element value MUST be a
      valid token previously returned by the server for the collection
      targeted by the request-URI.  Servers might need to invalidate
      tokens previously returned to clients.  Doing so will cause the
      clients to fall back to doing full synchronization using the
      report, though that will not require clients to download resources
      that are already cached and have not changed.  Even so, servers
      need to limit themselves to invalidating tokens only when
      absolutely necessary.  Specific reasons include:

      *  Servers wishing to limit the overall history that they keep for
         size or performance reasons. e.g., servers might maintain only
         up to 3 weeks worth of changes to a collection, or only up to
         10,000 total changes.

      *  Collection replacement: a collection that exists and has been
         synchronized with clients, might be deleted and re-created
         before a client has a chance to re-synchronize and notice the
         deletion.  In such a case, the client will present the token
         for the previous incarnation of the collection.  That will
         typically not be considered as valid, to ensure a full purge of
         the clients local cache of the data from the previous
         collection.

      *  User account changes: a server designed to scale to large
         numbers of users might partition users across different "back-
         end" data stores, each of which maintains an independent
         history of changes related to that store only.  Such a server
         might "re-balance" the user distribution from time-to-time and
         move a user's data from one datastore to another.  When doing
         so, it will likely preserve the state of the individual
         resources (e.g., their etags) but won't be able to preserve the
         synchronization history, forcing an invalidation of tokens.

      *  Change to server implementation: servers might be upgraded to a
         new implementation that tracks the history in a different
         manner and thus previous synchronization history is no longer
         valid.

   Postconditions:

      (DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits): The number of changes
      reported in the response must fall within the client specified
      limit.  This condition might be triggered if a client requests a
      limit on the number of responses (as per Section 3.7) but the
      server is unable to truncate the result set at or below that
      limit.

3.3.  Depth behavior

   Servers MUST support only Depth:0 behavior with the DAV:sync-
   collection report. i.e., the report targets only the collection being
   synchronized in a single request.  However, clients do need to
   "scope" the synchronization to different levels within that
   collection, specifically immediate children (level "1") and all
   children at any depth (level "infinite").  To specify which level to
   use, clients MUST include a DAV:sync-level XML element in the
   request.

   o  When the client specifies the DAV:sync-level XML element with a
      value of "1", only appropriate internal member URLs (immediate
      children) of the collection specified as the request URI are
      reported.

   o  When the client specifies the DAV:sync-level XML element with a
      value of "infinite", all appropriate member URLs of the collection
      specified as the request URI are reported, provided child
      collections themselves also support the DAV:sync-collection
      report.

   o  DAV:sync-token values returned by the server are not specific to
      the value of the DAV:sync-level XML element used in the request.
      As such clients MAY use a DAV:sync-token value from a request with
      one DAV:sync-level XML element value for a similar request with a
      different DAV:sync-level XML element value, however the utility of
      this is limited.

   Note that when a server supports DAV:sync-level XML element with a
   value of "infinite", it might not be possible to synchronize some
   child collections within the collection targeted by the report.  When
   this occurs, the server MUST include a DAV:response element for the
   child collection with status 403 (Forbidden).  The 403 response MUST
   be sent once, when the collection is first reported to the client.
   In addition, the server MUST include a DAV:error element in the DAV:
   response element, indicating one of two possible causes for this:

      The DAV:sync-collection report is not supported at all on the
      child collection.  The DAV:error element MUST contain the DAV:
      supported-report element.

      The server is unwilling to report results for the child collection
      when a DAV:sync-collection report with the DAV:sync-level XML
      element set to "infinite" is executed on a parent resource.  This
      might happen when, for example, the synchronization state of the
      collection resource is controlled by another sub-system.  In such
      cases clients can perform the DAV:sync-collection report directly

      on the child collection instead.  The DAV:error element MUST
      contain the DAV:sync-traversal-supported element.

3.4.  Types of Changes Reported on Initial Synchronization

   When the DAV:sync-collection request contains an empty DAV:sync-token
   element, the server MUST return all member URLs of the collection
   (taking account of the DAV:sync-level XML element value as per
   Section 3.3, and optional truncation of results set as per
   Section 3.6) and it MUST NOT return any removed member URLs.  All
   types of member (collection or non-collection) MUST be reported.

3.5.  Types of Changes Reported on Subsequent Synchronizations

   When the DAV:sync-collection request contains a valid value for the
   DAV:sync-token element, two types of member URL state changes can be
   returned (changed or removed).  This section defines what triggers
   each of these to be returned.  It also clarifies the case where a
   member URL might have undergone multiple changes between two
   synchronization report requests.  In all cases, the DAV:sync-level
   XML element value as per Section 3.3, and optional truncation of
   results set as per Section 3.6, are taken into account by the server.

3.5.1.  Changed Member

   A member URL MUST be reported as changed if it has been newly mapped
   as a member of the target collection since the request sync-token was
   generated (e.g., when a new resource has been created as a child of
   the collection).  For example, this includes member URLs that have
   been newly mapped as the result of a COPY, MOVE, BIND [RFC5842], or
   REBIND [RFC5842] request.  All types of member URL (collection or
   non-collection) MUST be reported.

   In the case where a mapping between a member URL and the target
   collection was removed, then a new mapping with the same URI created,
   the member URL MUST be reported as changed and MUST NOT be reported
   as removed.

   A member URL MUST be reported as changed if its mapped resource's
   entity tag value (defined in Section 3.11 of [RFC2616]) has changed
   since the request sync-token was generated.

   A member URL MAY be reported as changed if the user issuing the
   request was granted access to this member URL, due to access control
   changes.

   Collection member URLs MUST be returned as changed if they are mapped
   to an underlying resource (i.e., entity body) and if the entity tag

   associated with that resource changes.  There is no guarantee that
   changes to members of a collection will result in a change in any
   entity tag of that collection, so clients cannot rely on a series of
   reports using the DAV:sync-level XML element value set to "1" at
   multiple levels to track all changes within a collection.  Instead
   DAV:sync-level XML element with a value of "infinite" has to be used.

3.5.2.  Removed Member

   A member MUST be reported as removed if its mapping under the target
   collection has been removed since the request sync-token was
   generated, and it has not been re-mapped since it was removed.  For
   example, this includes members that have been unmapped as the result
   of a MOVE, UNBIND [RFC5842], or REBIND [RFC5842] operation.  This
   also includes collection members that have been removed, including
   ones that themselves do not support the DAV:sync-collection report.

   If a member was added (and its mapped resource possibly modified),
   then removed between two synchronization report requests, it MUST be
   reported as removed.  This ensures that a client that adds a member
   is informed of the removal of the member, if the removal occurs
   before the client has had a chance to execute a synchronization
   report.

   A member MAY be reported as removed if the user issuing the request
   no longer has access to this member, due to access control changes.

   For a report with the DAV:sync-level XML element value set to
   "infinite", where a collection is removed, the server MUST NOT report
   the removal of any members of the removed collection.  Clients MUST
   assume that if a collection is reported as being removed, then all
   members of that collection have also been removed.

3.6.  Truncation of Results

   A server MAY limit the number of member URLs in a response, for
   example, to limit the amount of work expended in processing a
   request, or as the result of an explicit limit set by the client.  If
   the result set is truncated, the response MUST use status code 207,
   return a DAV:multistatus response body, and indicate a status of 507
   (Insufficient Storage) for the request URI.  That DAV:response
   element SHOULD include a DAV:error element with the DAV:number-of-
   matches-within-limits precondition, as defined in [RFC3744] (Section
   9.2).  DAV:response elements for all the changes being reported are
   also included.

   When truncation occurs, the DAV:sync-token value returned in the
   response MUST represent the correct state for the partial set of



Daboo & Quillaud          Expires July 22, 2012                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                 WebDAV Sync                  January 2012


   changes returned.  That allows the client to use the returned DAV:
   sync-token to fetch the next set of changes.  In this way the client
   can effectively "page" through the entire set of changes in a
   consistent manner.

   Clients MUST handle the 507 status on the request-URI in the response
   to the report.

   For example, consider a server that records changes using a strictly
   increasing integer to represent a "revision number" and uses that
   quantity as the DAV:sync-token value (appropriately encoded as a
   URI).  Assume the last DAV:sync-token used by the client was
   "http://example.com/sync/10", and since then 15 additional changes to
   different resources have occurred.  If the client executes a DAV:
   sync-collection request with a DAV:sync-token of
   "http://example.com/sync/10", without a limit the server would return
   15 DAV:response elements and a DAV:sync-token with value
   "http://example.com/sync/25".  But if the server choose to limit
   responses to at most 10 changes, then it would return only 10 DAV:
   response elements and a DAV:sync-token with value
   "http://example.com/sync/20", together with an additional DAV:
   response element for the request-URI with a status code of 507.
   Subsequently, the client can re-issue the request with the DAV:sync-
   token value returned from the server and fetch the remaining 5
   changes.

3.7.  Limiting Results

   A client can limit the number of results returned by the server
   through use of the DAV:limit element ([RFC5323], Section 5.17) in the
   request body.  This is useful when clients have limited space or
   bandwidth for the results.  If a server is unable to truncate the
   result at or below the requested number, then it MUST fail the
   request with a DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits post-condition
   error.  When the results can be correctly limited by the server, the
   server MUST follow the rules above for indicating a result set
   truncation to the client.

3.8.  Example: Initial DAV:sync-collection Report

   In this example, the client is making its first synchronization
   request to the server, so the DAV:sync-token element in the request
   is empty.  It also asks for the DAV:getetag property and for a
   proprietary property.  The server responds with the items currently
   in the targeted collection.  The current synchronization token is
   also returned.

4.  DAV:sync-token Property

   Name:  sync-token

   Namespace:  DAV:

   Purpose:  Contains the value of the synchronization token as it would
      be returned by a DAV:sync-collection report.

   Value:  Any valid URI.

   Protected:  MUST be protected because this value is created and
      controlled by the server.

   COPY/MOVE behavior:  This property value is dependent on the final
      state of the destination resource, not the value of the property
      on the source resource.

   Description:  The DAV:sync-token property MUST be defined on all
      resources that support the DAV:sync-collection report.  It
      contains the value of the synchronization token as it would be
      returned by a DAV:sync-collection report on that resource at the
      same point in time.  It SHOULD NOT be returned by a PROPFIND DAV:
      allprop request (as defined in Section 14.2 of [RFC4918]).

   Definition:


   <!ELEMENT sync-token #PCDATA>

   <!-- Text MUST be a valid URI -->


5.  DAV:sync-token Use with If Header

   WebDAV provides an If pre-condition header that allows for "state
   tokens" to be used as pre-conditions on HTTP requests (as defined in
   Section 10.4 of [RFC4918]).  This specification allows the DAV:sync-
   token value to be used as one such token in an If header.  By using
   this, clients can ensure requests only complete when there have been
   no changes to the content of a collection, by virtue of an un-changed
   DAV:sync-token value.  Servers MUST support use of DAV:sync-token
   values in If request headers.

5.1.  Example: If Pre-Condition with PUT

   In this example, the client has already used the DAV:sync-collection
   report to synchronize the collection /home/cyrusdaboo/collection/.

Internet-Draft                 WebDAV Sync                  January 2012


   Now it wants to add a new resource to the collection, but only if
   there have been no other changes since the last synchronization.
   Note, that because the DAV:sync-token is defined on the collection
   and not on the resource targeted by the request, the If header value
   needs to use the "Resource_Tag" construct for the header syntax to
   correctly identify that the supplied state token refers to the
   collection resource.

   >> Request <<


   PUT /home/cyrusdaboo/collection/newresource.txt HTTP/1.1
   Host: webdav.example.com
   If: </home/cyrusdaboo/collection/>
     (<http://example.com/ns/sync/12345>)
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: xxxx

   Some content here...


   >> Response <<


   HTTP/1.1 201 Created


5.2.  Example: If Pre-Condition with MKCOL

   In this example, the client has already used the DAV:sync-collection
   report to synchronize the collection /home/cyrusdaboo/collection/.
   Now it wants to add a new collection to the collection, but only if
   there have been no other changes since the last synchronization.
   Note, that because the DAV:sync-token is defined on the collection
   and not on the resource targeted by the request, the If header value
   needs to use the "Resource_Tag" construct for the header syntax to
   correctly identify that the supplied state token refers to the
   collection resource.  In this case the request fails as another
   change has occurred to the collection corresponding to the supplied
   DAV:sync-token.

   >> Request <<


   MKCOL /home/cyrusdaboo/collection/child/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: webdav.example.com
   If: </home/cyrusdaboo/collection/>
     (<http://example.com/ns/sync/12346>)

Appendix A.  Backwards Compatible Handling of Depth

   In prior draft versions of this specification the Depth request
   header was used instead of the DAV:sync-level element to indicate the
   "scope" of the synchronization request.  Servers that wish to be
   backwards compatible with clients conforming to the older
   specification should do the following: if a DAV:sync-level element is
   not present in the request body, use the Depth header value as the
   equivalent value for the missing DAV:sync-level element.

Appendix B.  Change History (to be removed prior to publication as an
             RFC)

   Changes in -07:

   1.   Updated CardDAV reference.

   2.   IETF LC: expanded acronym in abstract.

   3.   IETF LC: member URI -> member URL.

   4.   IETF LC: Clarified limit example to indicate 15 changes are to
        different resources.

   5.   IETF LC: Removed unnecessary DAV: prefix in !ELEMENT DTD
        fragments.

Internet-Draft                 WebDAV Sync                  January 2012


   6.   IETF LC: Changed from using Depth header to DAV:sync-level
        element.

   7.   Apps Review: Clarified that pre-condition applies to request-
        URI.

   8.   GenArt: Clarified that "mapped" implies addition of a resource
        in first paragraph of 3.5.1.

   9.   IESG: Clarified meaning of "opaque" to refer to client treatment
        of sync-token.

   10.  IESG: BIND is now informative again.

   11.  IESG: Removed paragraph from Security Considerations that was
        already covered by WebDAV considerations.

   12.  IESG: Created a list of allowed reasons for server sync-token
        invalidation.

   Changes in -06:

   1.  Changed the 405 error into a 403 with a DAV:error element.

   2.  Stated more clearly that both depth:1 and depth:infinity must be
       supported.

   3.  Tied up sync-token as URI changes.

   4.  Made BIND a normative reference.

   5.  Take into account REBIND.

   6.  Reworked text to more accurately make the distinction between
       member URIs and resources, which should clarify the interaction
       with extensions like BIND.

   Changes in -05:

   1.  Added option to use DAV:sync-token as an If pre-condition state
       token.

   2.  DAV:sync-token value now required to be a URI so it can be used
       in the If header.

   1.  Depth:infinity support added.

   2.  Collection resources are now reported as changed if they have a
       valid entity tag associated with them.

   Changes in -03:

   1.  Changed D:propstat to D:prop in marshalling.

   2.  Added request for dead property in examples.

   3.  Made D:prop mandatory in request so that D:response always
       contains at least one D:propstat as per WebDAV definition.

   4.  Removed DAV:status from response when resource is created/
       modified, thus allowing to get rid of DAV:sync-response in favor
       of a regular DAV:response.  As a consequence, there is no longer
       any difference in the report between created and modified
       resources.

   5.  Resource created, then removed between 2 sync MUST be returned as
       removed.

   6.  Added ability for server to truncate results and indicate such to
       the client.

   7.  Added ability for client to request the server to limit the
       result set.

   Changes in -02:

   1.  Added definition of sync-token WebDAV property.

   2.  Added references to SEARCH, CalDAV, CardDAV as alternative ways
       to first synchronize a collection.

   3.  Added section defining under which condition each state change
       (new, modified, removed) should be reported.  Added reference to
       BIND.

   4.  Incorporated feedback from Julian Reschke and Ciny Joy.

   5.  More details on the use of the DAV:valid-sync-token precondition.

   Changes in -01:

   1.  Updated to 4918 reference.
