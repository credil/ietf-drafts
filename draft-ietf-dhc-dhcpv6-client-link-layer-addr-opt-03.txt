Internet-Draft   DHCPv6 client link-layer address option    October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an optional mechanism and the related
   DHCPv6 option to allow first hop DHCPv6 relay agent directly
   connected to the client to populate client link-layer address in the
   DHCPv6 messages being sent towards the server.


2.  Problem Background and Scenario

   DHCPv4 protocol specification [RFC2131] provides a way to specify the
   client hardware address in the DHCPv4 message header.  DHCPv4 message
   header has 'htype' and 'chaddr' fields to specify client hardware
   address type and hardware address respectively.  The client hardware
   address thus learnt can be used by DHCPv4 server and relay in
   different ways.  In some of the deployments DHCPv4 servers use
   'chaddr' as a customer identifier and a key for lookup in the client
   lease database.

   With the incremental deployment of IPv6 to existing IPv4 networks,
   effectively an enablement of dual-stack, there will be devices that
   act as both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients.  In service provider
   deployments, a typical DHCPv4 implementation will use the client
   hardware address as one of the keys to build DHCP client lease
   database.  In dual stack scenarios it is desirable for the operator
   to associate DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages as belonging to the same
   client interface based on an identifier that is already used by that
   operator such as the client hardware address.

   Currently, the DHCPv6 protocol specification [RFC3315] does not
   define a way for DHCP clients to specify client link-layer address in
   the DHCPv6 message sent towards DHCPv6 Server.  Similarly DHCPv6
   Relay or Server cannot glean client link-layer address from the
   contents of DHCPv6 message received.  DHCPv6 protocol specification
   mandates all clients to prepare and send DUID as the client
   identifier option in all the DHCPv6 message exchange.  However none
   of these methods provide a simple way to extract client's link-layer
   address.  This presents a problem to an operator who is using an
   existing DHCPv4 system with the client hardware address as the
   customer identifier, and desires to correlate DHCPv6 assignments
   using the same identifier.  Modifying the system to use DUID based
   correlation across DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 is possible, but it requires a
   modification of the DHCPv4 system and associated back-ends.

   Providing an option in DHCPv6 relay forward messages to carry client
   link-layer address explicitly will help above mentioned scenarios.
   For e.g. it can be used along with other identifiers to associate
   DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages from a dual stack client.  Further, having

   client link-layer address in DHCPv6 will help in proving additional
   information in event debugging and logging related to the client at
   relay and server.  The proposed option may be used in wide range of
   networks, two notable deployment models are service provider and
   enterprise network environments.


3.  DHCPv6 Client Link-layer Address Option

   The format of the DHCPv6 Client Link-layer Address option is shown
   below.
    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR  |           option-length       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    hardware type (16 bits)    |                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               |
   |               link-layer address (variable length)            |
   |                                                               |
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   option-code:        OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR (TBD)
   option-length:      2 + length of link-layer address
   hardware type:      Client Link-layer address type. The hardware type MUST be a
                       valid hardware type assigned by the IANA, as described in [RFC0826]
   link-layer address: Client Link-layer address.



4.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior

   DHCPv6 Relay agents which receive messages originating from clients
   (for example Solicit and Request, but not, for example, Relay Forward
   or Advertise) MAY include the link-layer source address of the
   received DHCPv6 message in Client Link-layer Address option in
   relayed DHCPv6 Relay Forward messages.  The DHCPv6 Relay agent
   behavior can depend on configuration that decides whether Client
   Link-layer Address option needs to be processed and included.


5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   If DHCPv6 Server is configured to store or use client link-layer
   address, it SHOULD look for the client link-layer address option in
   the RELAY-FORW DHCP message of the DHCPv6 Relay agent closest to the

   client.  This specification does not specify the mechanism for DHCPv6
   Server to find out link-layer address of the directly connected
   clients as a DHCP option as it can obtain it directly from the link-
   layer source address of the received DHCPv6 message.

   There is no requirement that a server return this option and its data
   in a downstream DHCP message.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to
   OPTION_CLIENT_LINKLAYER_ADDR from the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options"
   registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-
   parameters.xml).


7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related DHCPv6 are described in section 23 of
   [RFC3315].
