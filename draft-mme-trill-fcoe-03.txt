Abstract

   Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and TRILL are two emerging
   standards in the data center environment. While these two protocols
   are seemingly unrelated, they have a very similar behavior in the
   forwarding plane, as both perform hop-by-hop forwarding over
   Ethernet, modifying the packet's MAC addresses at each hop. This
   document describes an architecture for the integrated deployment of
   these two protocols.

1. Introduction

   Data center networks are rapidly evolving towards a consolidated
   approach, where Ethernet is used as the common infrastructure for all
   types of traffic. Storage traffic was traditionally dominated by the
   Fibre Channel (FC) protocol suite. At the intersection between these
   two technologies a new technology was born, Fibre Channel over
   Ethernet (FCoE), where native Fibre Channel (FC) packets are
   encapsulated with an FCoE encapsulation over an Ethernet header. FCoE
   is specified in [FC-BB-5] (A future version of FCoE is under
   development and is expected to be specified in a document to be
   referred to as FC-BB-6; however, this is a work in progress and
   beyond the scope of this document.)

Internet-Draft             FCoE over TRILL                   July 2012


   Traffic between two FCoE end nodes (ENodes) is forwarded through one
   or more FCoE Forwarders (FCF). An FCF takes a forwarding decision
   based on the Fibre Channel destination ID (D_ID), and enforces
   security policies between ENodes, also known as zoning. Once an FCF
   takes a forwarding decision, it modifies the source and destination
   MAC addresses of the packet, to reflect the path to the next hop FCF
   or ENode. FCFs use a routing protocol called Fabric Shortest Path
   First (FSPF) to find the optimal path to each destination. An FCF
   typically has one or more native Fibre Channel interfaces, allowing
   it to communicate with native Fibre Channel devices, e.g., storage
   arrays.

   TRILL [RFCTRILL] is a protocol for transparent least cost routing,
   where RBridges forward traffic to their detination based on a least
   cost route, using a TRILL encapsulation header. RBridges forward
   TRILL-encapsulated packets based on the Egress RBridge Nickname in
   the TRILL header. An RBridge forwards a TRILL-encapsulated packet
   after modifying its MAC addresses to reflect the path to the next-hop
   RBridge, and decrementing a Hop Count field.

   TRILL and FCoE bear a strong resemblance in their forwarding planes.
   Both protocols take a forwarding decision based on protocol addresses
   above Layer 2, and modify the Ethernet MAC addresses on a per-hop
   basis. Each of the protocols uses its own routing protocol rather
   than using any type of bridging protocol such as spanning tree
   protocol [802.1Q] or the Shortest Path Bridging protocol [802.1aq].

   FCoE and TRILL are both targeted at the data center environment, and
   their concurrent deployment is self-evident. This document describes
   an architecture for the integrated deployment of these two protocols.

3. FCoE over TRILL

3.1. FCoE over a TRILL Cloud

   The simplest approach for running FCoE traffic over a TRILL network
   is presented in Figure 1. The figure illustrates a TRILL-enabled
   network, where FCoE traffic is transparently forwarded over the TRILL
   cloud. The figure illustrates two ENodes, a Server and an FCoE
   Storage Array, an FCF, and a native Fibre Channel SAN connected to
   the FCF.

   FCoE traffic between the two ENodes is sent from the first ENode over
   the TRILL cloud to the FCF, and then back through the TRILL cloud to
   the second ENode.

          (ENode B)
                           The "Separate Cloud" Approach

   The configuration in Figure 1 separates the TRILL cloud(s) and the
   FCoE cloud(s). The TRILL cloud forwards FCoE traffic as standard
   Ethernet traffic, and appears to the ENodes and FCF as an Ethernet
   LAN. FCoE traffic forwarded over the TRILL cloud includes FCoE data
   frames, as well as FCoE control traffic, including FCoE
   Initialization Protocol (FIP) frames. To eliminate frame loss due to
   queue overflow, the switches in any TRILL Cloud used with FCoE would
   likely implement and use the relevant DCB protocols [TRILDCB].

   The main drawback of the Separate Cloud approach is that RBridges and
   FCFs are separate nodes in the network, resulting in more cabeling
   and boxes, and communication between Enodes usually requires two
   TRILL cloud traversals with twice as many hops. As mentioned above,
   data center networking is converging towards a consolidated and cost
   effective approach, where the same infrastructure and equipment is
   used for both data and storage traffic, and where high efficiency and
   minimal number of hops are important factors when designing the
   network topology.

   Clearly the Separate Cloud approach is not practical, and is not
   commonly deployed. It is presented as a background and motivation for
   the approach discussed in the next section.

3.2. FCoE over RBridge

3.2.1. FCRB

   Rather than the Separate Cloud approach discussed in the previous
   subsection, an alternate approach is presented, where each switch
   incorporates both an FCF entity and an RBridge entity. This
   consolidated entity is referred to as FCoE-forwarder-over-RBridge
   (FCRB).

   Figure 2 illustrates an FCRB, and its main building blocks. An FCRB
   can be functionally viewed as two independent entities:

   o An FCoE Forwarder (FCF) entity.

   o An RBridge entity.

   The FCF entity is connected to one of the ports of the RBridge, and
   appears to the RBridge as a native Ethernet host. A detailed

 (ENode B)
                             FCRB Entity in the Network

   The FCRB entity maintains layer independence between the TRILL and
   FCoE protocols, while enabling both protocols on the same network.

   It is noted that FCoE traffic is always forwarded through an FCF, and
   cannot be forwarded directly between two ENodes. Thus, FCoE traffic
   between ENodes A and B in the topology in Figure 1 is forwarded
   through the path

   ENode A-->TRILL cloud-->FCF-->TRILL cloud-->ENode B

   Traffic between A and B in the topology in Figure 2 is forwarded
   through the path

   ENode A-->FCRB-->ENode B

   Hence, the usage of FCRB entities allows TRILL and FCoE to use common
   infrastructure and equipment, as opposed to the Separate Cloud
   topology presented in Figure 1.

3.2.2. Topology

   The network configuration illustrated in Figure 3 shows a typical
   topology of a data center network. Servers are hierarchically
   connected through Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches, also known as access
   switches, and each set of racks is aggregated through an End-of-Row
   (EoR) switch. The EoR switches are aggregated to the Core switches,
   which may be connected to other clouds, such as an external WAN or a
   native FC SAN.

   Note that in the example in Figure 3 all the ToR, EoR and core
   switches are FCRB entities, but it is also possible for some of the
   network nodes to be pure RBridges, creating a topology where FCRBs
   are interconnected through TRILL clouds.

                        Traffic between two ENodes - Example

   Figure 4 illustrates the traffic between ENodes A and C that are not
   connected to the same ToR.

   o FCoE traffic from A is sent to the ToR over the Ethernet
      interface. The destination MAC address is the address of the FCF
      entity at the ToR.

   o ToR:

         o The packet is forwarded to the FCF entity at the ToR. Thus,
           forwarding between A and the FCF at the ToR is analogous to
           forwarding between two Ethernet hosts.

         o The FCF entity at the ToR takes a forwarding decision based
           on the FC addresses. This decision is based on the FSPF
           routing protocol at the FCF layer. The next hop at the FCF
           layer is the EoR FCF entity.

         o The FCF then updates the destination MAC address of the
           packet to the address of the EoR FCF.

         o The packet is forwarded to the RBridge entity, where it is
           encapsulated in a TRILL header, and sent to the RBridge at
           the EoR over a single hop of the TRILL network.

   o The RBridge entity in the EoR FCRB, acting as the egress RBridge,
      decapsulates the TRILL header and forwards the FCoE packet to the
      FCF entity. From this point the forwarding process is similar to
      the one described above for the ToR.

   o A similar forwarding process takes place at the next hop ToR FCRB,
      where the FCRB finally forwards the FCoE packet to the target
      ENode.

   Figure 5 illustrates a second example, where traffic is sent between
   an ENode and an FC Storage Array, following the network topology in
   Figure 3.

   o FCoE traffic from the ENode is sent to the ToR over the Ethernet
      interface. The forwarding process through the ToR FCRB and through
      the EoR is similar to the corresponding steps in Section 3.2.3.1.

   o When the packet reaches the core FCRB, the egress RBridge entity
      decapsulates the TRILL header and forwards the FCoE packet to the
      FCF entity. The packet is then forwarded as a native FC packet
      through the FC interface to the native FC node.

3.2.3.3. Example - ENode to ENode with non-FCRB EoR

   The example illustrated in Figure 6 is similar to the one shown
   in Figure 4, except that the EoR is an RBridge rather than an FCRB.

                        Traffic between two ENodes - Example

   An FCoE packet sent from A to C is forwarded as follows:

   o The packet is sent to the FCF in ToR 1, as in the previous
      example.

   o The FCF in ToR 1 takes a forwarding decision based on the FC
      addresses, and forwards the packet to the next hop FCF, which
      resides in ToR 2. This forwarding decision is taken at the FCF
      layer, and is based on the FSPF routing protocol.

   o The packet is then forwarded to the RBridge entity in ToR 1, where
      it is encapsulated in a TRILL encapsulation, and forwarded to the
      RBridge at ToR 2. The packet is forwarded over the TRILL cloud
      through the RBridge at the EoR. The path through the TRILL cloud
      is determined by TRILL's IS-IS routing protocol.

   o Once the packet reaches ToR 2, it is forwarded in a similar manner
      to the description in Section 3.2.3.1.

   This example demonstrates that it is possible to have a hybrid
   network, where some of the nodes are FCRBs, and some of the nodes are
   RBridges. A network configuration where some of the nodes are FCFs
   and others are not FCoE aware is sometimes referred to in the FCoE
   jargon as sparse mode. In dense mode, on the other hand, all nodes in
   the network are FCFs. Thus, while the example in Figure 4 illustrates
   a dense mode topology where all bridges are FCRBs, the example
   in Figure 6 shows a sparse mode, where traffic between FCRBs can be
   forwarded through a TRILL cloud with several RBridge hops.

   data exchanges transported over an FCoE encapsulation. FCoE also

   requires control and management traffic that is used for initializing
   sessions (FIP), distributing routing information (FSPF), and fabric
   administration and management.

   The FCoE Initialization Protocol (FIP) uses Ethernet frames with a
   dedicated Ethertype, allowing the FCF to distinguish it from other
   traffic. FIP uses both unicast and multicast traffic. The following
   example describes the forwarding scheme of a multicast FIP packet
   sent through the network depicted in Figure 4:

   o ENode A generates a multicast frame to a multicast MAC address
      representing all the FCFs (All-FCF-MAC).

   o The packet is forwarded to the ToR FCRB node. The RBridge entity
      forwards a copy of the packet to its FCF entity, and also sends
      the packet through the TRILL cloud as a multicast TRILL
      encapsulated packet.

   o Each of the FCRBs in turn receives the packet, forwards a copy to
      its FCF entity, as well as forwarding the packet through the TRILL
      network, allowing all the FCFs to receive the packet.

   While FIP packets have a dedicated Ethertype and frame format, other
   types of FCoE control and management frames use the same FCoE
   encapsulation as FCoE data traffic. Thus, the forwarding scheme for
   such control traffic is similar to the examples described in the
   previous subsections, with the exception that these frames can be
   sent between ENodes, between FCFs, or between ENodes and FCFs.
