In this memo, we attempt to give some estimates for the probability of
undetected errors to facilitate the selection of an error detection
code for the Internet Protocol Small Computer System Interface
(iSCSI).

We will also attempt to compare Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs) with
other checksum forms (e.g., Fletcher, Adler, weighted checksums), as
permitted by available data.
