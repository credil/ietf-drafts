Internet-Draft      Key Wrapping with AES GCM for JWE          June 2013


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines how to encrypt (wrap) keys with the AES
   GCM algorithm [AES] [NIST.800-38D] for JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
   [JWE] objects.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the same terminology as the JSON Web
   Encryption (JWE) [JWE] and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specifications.


3.  Key Encryption with AES GCM

   This section defines the specifics of encrypting a JWE Content
   Encryption Key (CEK) with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in
   Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) [AES] [NIST.800-38D] using 128 or 256 bit
   keys.  The "alg" header parameter values "A128GCMKW" or "A256GCMKW"
   are respectively used in this case.

   Use of an Initialization Vector of size 96 bits is REQUIRED with this
   algorithm.

   The Additional Authenticated Data value used is the empty octet
   string.

   The requested size of the Authentication Tag output MUST be 128 bits,
   regardless of the key size.

   Let JWE Encrypted Key value be the concatenation of the
   Initialization Vector value, the Ciphertext output, and the
   Authentication Tag output.

   During key decryption, the JWE Encrypted Key value is split into
   three inputs to the AES GCM decryption algorithm: the first 96 bits
   are the Initialization Vector value, the last 128 bits are the
   Authentication Tag value, and the remaining bits in between are the
   Ciphertext value.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms Registration

   This specification registers the algorithms defined in Section 3 in
   the JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms registry [JWA].

4.1.1.  Registry Contents

   o  Algorithm Name: "A128GCMKW"
   o  Algorithm Usage Location(s): "alg"
   o  Implementation Requirements: OPTIONAL
   o  Change Controller: IETF
   o  Specification Document(s): Section 3 of [[ this document ]]

   o  Algorithm Name: "A256GCMKW"
   o  Algorithm Usage Location(s): "alg"
   o  Implementation Requirements: OPTIONAL
   o  Change Controller: IETF
   o  Specification Document(s): Section 3 of [[ this document ]]


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [AES] and [NIST.800-38D] also apply to
   this specification.
