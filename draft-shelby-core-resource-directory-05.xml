  <section anchor='introduction' title="Introduction">

  <t>
  The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) work aims at realizing the REST architecture in a suitable form for the most constrained nodes (e.g. 8-bit microcontrollers with limited RAM and ROM) and networks (e.g. 6LoWPAN). CoRE is aimed at machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.
  </t>
  <t>
  The discovery of resources offered by a constrained server is very important in machine-to-machine applications where there are no humans in the loop and static interfaces result in fragility. The discovery of resources provided by an HTTP Web Server is typically called Web Linking <xref target="RFC5988"/>. The use of Web Linking for the description and discovery of resources hosted by constrained web servers is specified by the CoRE Link Format <xref target="RFC6690"/>. This specification however only describes how to discover resources from the web server that hosts them by requesting /.well-known/core. In many M2M scenarios, direct discovery of resources is not practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where multicast traffic is inefficient. These problems can be solved by employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which hosts descriptions of resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for those resources.
  </t>
  <t>
  This document specifies the web interfaces that a Resource Directory supports in order for web servers to discover the RD and to registrer, maintain, lookup and remove resource descriptions. Furthermore, new link attributes useful in conjunction with a Resource Directory are defined. Although the examples in this document show the use of these interfaces with CoAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>, they may be applied in an equivalent manner to HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/>.

Readers should also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>. The URI Template format is used to describe the REST interfaces defined in this specification <xref target="RFC6570"/>. This specification makes use of the following additional terminology:
	<list style="hanging">

  <section anchor='arch' title="Architecture and Use Cases">

	<t>
	The resource directory architecture is shown in <xref target="fig-arch"/>. A Resource Directory (RD) is used as a repository for Web Links <xref target="RFC5988"/> about resources hosted on other web servers, which are called endpoints (EP). An endpoint is a web server associated with a port, thus a physical node may host one or more endpoints. The RD implements a set of REST interfaces for endpoints to register and maintain sets of Web Links (called resource directory entries), for the RD to validate entries, and for clients to lookup resources from the RD. Endpoints themselves can also act as clients. An RD can be logically segmented by the use of Domains. The domain an endpoint is associated with can be defined by the RD or configured by an outside entity.
	</t>
	<t>
	Endpoints are assumed to proactively register and maintain resource directory entries on the RD, which are soft state and need to be periodially refreshed. An endpoint is provided with interfaces to register, update and remove a resource directory entry. Furthermore, a mechanism to discover a RD using the CoRE Link Format is defined. It is also possible for an RD to proactively discover Web Links from endpoints and add them as resource directory entries, or to validate existing resource directory entries. A lookup interface for discovering any of the Web Links held in the RD is provided using the CoRE Link Format.  
	</t>

	  <section anchor='cellular' title="Use Case: Cellular M2M">
  	  <t>
	  Over the last few years, mobile operators around the world have focused on development of M2M solutions in order to expand the business to the new type of users, i.e. machines. The machines are connected directly to a mobile network using appropriate embedded air interface (GSM/GPRS, WCDMA, LTE) or via a gateway providing short and wide range wireless interfaces. From the system design point of view, the ambition is to design horizontal solutions that can enable utilization of machines in different applications depending on their current availability and capabilities as well as application requirements, thus avoiding silo like solutions. One of the crucial enablers of such design is the ability to discover resources (machines - endpoints) capable of providing required information at a given time or acting on instructions from the end users. 	
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	  In a typical scenario, during a boot-up procedure (and periodically afterwards), the machines (endpoints) register with a Resource Directory (for example EPs installed on vehicles enabling tracking of their position for the fleet management purposes and monitoring environment parameters) hosted by the mobile operator or somewhere else in the network, submiting a description of own capabilities. Due to the usual network configuration of mobile networks, the EPs attached to the mobile network do not have routable addresses. Therefore, a remote server is usually used to provide proxy access to the EPs. The address of each (proxy) endpoint on this server is included in the resource description stored in the RD. The users, for example mobile applications for environment monitoring, contact the RD, look-up the endpoints capable of providing information about the environment using appropriate set of tags, obtain information on how to contact them (URLs of the proxy server) and then initate interaction to obtain information that is finally processed, displayed on the screen and usually stored in a database. Similarly, fleet management systems provide a set of credentials along with the appropriate tags to the RD to look-up for EPs deployed on the vehicles the application is responsible for. 
	  </t>
	  </section>

	  <section anchor='automation' title="Use Case: Home and Building Automation">
	  <t>
	  Home and commercial building automation systems can benefit from the use of M2M web services. The use of CoRE in home automation across multiple subnets is described in <xref target="I-D.brandt-coap-subnet-discovery"/> and in commercial building automation in <xref target="I-D.vanderstok-core-bc"/>. The discovery requirements of these applications are demanding. Home automation usually relies on run-time discovery to commision the system, whereas in building automation a combination of professional commissioning and run-time discovery is used. Both home and building automation involve peer-to-peer interactions between endpoints, and involve battery-powered sleeping devices. 
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  The exporting of resource information to other discovery systems is also important in these automation applications. In home automation there is a need to interact with other consumer electronics, which may already support DNS-SD, and in building automation larger resource directories or DNS-SD covering multiple buildings.

  <section anchor='simple' title="Simple Directory Discovery">
  
  <t> Not all endpoints hosting resources are expected to know how to implement
  the Resource Directory Function Set and thus explicitly register with a
  Resource Directory (or other such directory server). Instead, simple endpoints
  can implement the generic Simple Directory Discovery approach described in
  this section. An RD implementing this specification MUST implement Simple
  Directory Discovery. However, there may be security reasons why this form of 
  directory discovery would be disabled. </t>
  
  <t>
  This approach requires that the endpoint makes the hosted resources that it 
  wants discovered available as links on its /.well-known/core interface as 
  specified in <xref target="RFC6690"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
  The endpoint then finds one or more IP addresses of the directory server it 
  wants to know about its resources as described in 
  <xref target="simple_finding"/>.    
  </t>
  <t>
  An endpoint that wants to make itself discoverable occasionally
  sends a POST request to the /.well-known/core URI of any candidate directory
  server that it finds. The body of the POST request is either</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>empty, in which case the directory server is encouraged by this POST 
  request to perform GET requests at the requesting server's default discovery
  URI.</t>
</list></t>

<t>or</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>a link-format document, which indicates the specific services that the
requesting server wants to make known to the directory server.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The directory server integrates the information it received this way into its
resource directory.  It MAY make the information available to further
directories, if it can ensure that a loop does not form.  The protocol used
between directories to ensure loop-free operation is outside the scope of
this document.</t>
  
	<t>
		The following example shows an endpoint using simple resource discovery,
		by simply sending a POST with its links in the body to a directory.

<section anchor="simple_finding" title="Finding a Directory Server">

<t>Endpoints that want to contact a directory server can obtain candidate IP
addresses for such servers in a number of ways.</t>

<t>In a 6LoWPAN, good candidates can be taken from:</t>

<t><list style='symbols'>
  <t>specific static configuration (e.g., anycast addresses), if any,</t>
  <t>the ABRO option of 6LoWPAN-ND <xref target="RFC6775"/>,</t>
  <t>other ND options that happen to point to servers (such as RDNSS),</t>
  <t>DHCPv6 options that might be defined later.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In networks with more inexpensive use of multicast, the candidate IP 
address may be a well-known multicast address, i.e. directory servers are 
found by simply sending POST requests to that well-known multicast address
 (details TBD).</t>

<t>As some of these sources are just (more or less educated) guesses,
endpoints MUST make use of any error messages to very strictly
rate-limit requests to candidate IP addresses that don't work out.
E.g., an ICMP Destination Unreachable message (and, in particular, the
port unreachable code for this message) may indicate the lack of a CoAP
server on the candidate host, or a CoAP error response code such as
4.05 "Method Not Allowed" may indicate unwillingness of a CoAP server
to act as a directory server.</t>

  <section anchor='rd' title="Resource Directory Function Set">

	<t>
	This section defines the REST interfaces between an RD and endpoint servers, which is called the Resource Directory Function Set. Although the examples throughout this section assume use of CoAP    
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>, these REST interfaces can also be realized using HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/>. An RD implementing this specification MUST support the discovery, registration, update, and removal interfaces defined in this section and MAY support the validation interface. For the purpose of validation, an endpoint implementing this specification SHOULD support ETag validation on /.well-known/core (which is very straightforward for static /.well-known/core link documents).
	</t>
	
	<t>
	Resource directory entries are designed to be easily exported to other discovery mechanisms such as DNS-SD. For that reason, parameters that would meaningfully be mapped to DNS are limited to a maximum length of 63 bytes.  
	</t>

	  <section anchor='discovery' title="Discovery">
	
		<t>
		Before an endpoint can make use of an RD, it must first know the RD's IP address, port and the path of its RD Function Set. There can be several mechanisms for discovering the RD including assuming a default location (e.g. on an Edge Router in a LoWPAN), by assigning an anycast address to the RD, using DHCP, or by discovering the RD using the CoRE Link Format (also see <xref target="simple_finding"/>). This section defines discovery of the RD using the well-known interface of the CoRE Link Format <xref target="RFC6690"/> as the required mechanism. It is however expected that RDs will also be discoverable via other methods depending on the deployment. 
		</t>
		
		<t>
		Discovery is performed by sending either a multicast or unicast GET request to /.well-known/core and including a Resource Type (rt) parameter <xref target="RFC6690"/> with the value "core.rd" in the query string. Likewise, a Resource Type parameter value of "core.rd-lookup" is used to discover the RD Lookup Function Set. Upon success, the response will contain a payload with a link format entry for each RD discovered, with the URL indicating the root resource of the RD. When performing multicast discovery, the multicast IP address used will depend on the scope required and the multicast capabilities of the network.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		An RD implementation of this specification MUST support query filtering for the rt parameter as defined in <xref target="RFC6690"/>.
		</t>

        <t>The discovery request interface is specified as follows: 
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Interaction:">EP -> RD</t>
          <t hangText="Method:">GET</t>	
          <t hangText="URI Template:">/.well-known/core{?rt}</t>
          <t hangText="URI Template Variables:"> 
          	<list style="hanging">
          		<t hangText="rt := ">Resource Type (optional). MAY contain the value "core.rd", "core.rd-lookup" or "core.rd*"</t>
          	</list>
          </t>
          <t hangText="Content-Type:">application/link-format (if any)</t>
        </list>
       	</t>
          
		<t>The following response codes are defined for this interface: 
        <list style="hanging">         
          <t hangText="Success:"> 2.05 "Content" with an application/link-format payload containing a matching entry for the RD resource.</t>
          <t hangText="Failure:"> 4.04 "Not Found" is returned in case no matching entry is found for a unicast request.</t>
          <t hangText="Failure:"> No error response to a multicast request.</t>
          <t hangText="Failure:"> 4.00 "Bad Request" </t>
        </list>
       	</t>

		<t>
		The following example shows an endpoint discovering an RD using this interface, thus learning that the base RD resource is at /rd. Note that it is up to the RD to choose its base RD resource, although it is recommended to use default locations where possible. 
		</t>

		After discovering the location of an RD Function Set, an endpoint MAY register its resources using the registration interface. This interface accepts a POST from an endpoint containing the list of resources to be added to the directory as the message payload in the CoRE Link Format along with query string parameters indicating the name of the endpoint, its domain and the lifetime of the registration. All parameters except the endpoint name are optional. It is expected that other specifications MAY define further parameters (it is to be determined if a registry of parameters is needed for this purpose). The RD then creates a new resource or updates an existing resource in the RD and returns its location. An endpoint MUST use that location when refreshing registrations using this interface. Endpoint resources in the RD are kept active for the period indicated by the lifetime parameter. The endpoint is responsible for refreshing the entry within this period using either the registration or update interface. The registration interface MUST be implemented to be idempotent, so that registering twice with the same endpoint parameter does not create multiple RD entries.

An update MAY contain registration parameters if there have been changes since the last registration or update. Parameters that have not changed SHOULD NOT be included in an update.

<section anchor='group' title="Group Function Set">

	<t>
		This section defines a function set for the creation of groups of endpoints for the purpose of managing and looking up endpoints for group operations. The group function set is similar to the resource directory function set, in that a group may be created or removed. However unlike an endpoint entry, a group entry consists of a list of endpoints and does not have a lifetime associated with it. In order to make use of multicast requests with CoAP, a group MAY have a multicast address associated with it.  
	</t>
	
	
	  <section anchor='group-register' title="Register a Group">

		<t>
			In order to create a group, a management entity used to configure groups, makes a request to the RD indicating the name of the group to create (or update), the optional domain the group belongs to, and the optional multicast address of the group. The registration message includes the list of endpoints that belong to that group. If an endpoint has already registered with the RD, the RD attempts to use the context of the endpoint from its RD endpoint entry. If the client registering the group knows the endpoint has already registered, then it MAY send a blank target URI for that endpoint link when registering the group.

<section anchor='lookup' title="RD Lookup Function Set">

	  <t>
	  In order for an RD to be used for discovering resources registered with it, a lookup interface can be provided using this function set. This lookup interface is defined as a default, and it is assumed that RDs may also support lookups to return resource descriptions in alternative formats (e.g. Atom or HTML Link) or using more advanced interfaces (e.g. supporting context or semantic based lookup). 
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  This function set allows lookups for domains, groups, endpoints and resources using attributes defined in the RD Function Set and for use with the CoRE Link Format. The result of a lookup request is the list of links (if any) in CoRE Link Format corresponding to the type of lookup. The target of these links SHOULD be the actual location of the domain, endpoint or resource, but MAY be an intermediate proxy e.g. in the case of an HTTP lookup interface for CoAP endpoints. Multiple query parameters MAY be included in a lookup, all included parameters MUST match for a resource to be returned.

  <section anchor="attributes" title="New Link-Format Attributes">

	<t>
	When using the CoRE Link Format to describe resources being discovered by or posted to a resource directory service, additional information about those resources is useful. This specification defines the following new attributes for use in the CoRE Link Format <xref target="RFC6690"/>:
	</t>

      <figure>
         <artwork><![CDATA[
         
   link-extension    = ( "ins" "=" quoted-string ) ; Max 63 bytes         
   link-extension    = ( "exp" ) 

         ]]></artwork>
       </figure>

	<section title="Resource Instance 'ins' attribute">
	
	 	 <t>
	 	 The Resource Instance "ins" attribute is an identifier for this resource, which makes it possible to distinguish from other similar resources. This attribute is similar in use to the "Instance" portion of a DNS-SD record, and SHOULD be unique across resources with the same Resource Type attribute in the domain it is used. A Resource Instance might be a descriptive string like "Ceiling Light, Room 3", a short ID like "AF39" or a unique UUID or iNumber. This attribute is used by a Resource Directory to distinguish between multiple instances of the same resource type within a system.
	 	 </t>
 	 
	 	 <t>
	 	 This attribute MUST be no more than 63 bytes in length. The resource identifier attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in a link description. 
         </t>
	
	</section>
   
	<section title="Export 'exp' attribute">
	
	 	 <t>
	 	 The Export "exp" attribute is used as a flag to indicate that a link description MAY be exported by a resource directory to external directories.  
	 	 </t>
	 	 <t>
	 	 The CoRE Link Format is used for many purposes between CoAP endpoints. Some are useful mainly locally, for example checking the observability of a resource before accessing it, determining the size of a resource, or traversing dynamic resource structures. However, other links are very useful to be exported to other directories, for example the entry point resource to a functional service.

  <section title="Security Considerations">
         <t> 
         This document needs the same security considerations as described in Section 7 of <xref target="RFC5988"/> and Section 6 of <xref target="RFC6690"/>. The /.well-known/core resource may be protected e.g. using DTLS when hosted on a CoAP server as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>. 
     	 </t>
     	 <t>
     	 Access control SHOULD be performed separately for the RD Function Set and the RD Lookup Function Set, as different endpoints may be authorized to register with an RD from those authorized to lookup endpoints from the RD. Such access control SHOULD be performed in as fine-grained a level as possible. For example access control for lookups could be performed either at the domain, endpoint or resource level. 
     	 </t>

  <section title="IANA Considerations">

	<t>
	"core.rd", "core.rd-group" and "core.rd-lookup" resource types need to be registered with the resource type registry defined by <xref target="RFC6690"/>.
	</t>
	
	<t>
	The "exp" attribute needs to be registered when a future Web Linking attribute is created.
