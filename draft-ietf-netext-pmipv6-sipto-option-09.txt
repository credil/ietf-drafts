       IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6
              draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option-09.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a new mobility option, IPv4 Traffic
   Offload Selector option, for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This option can be
   used by the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway for
   negotiating IPv4 traffic offload policy for a mobility session.
   Based on the negotiated IPv4 traffic offload policy, a mobile access
   gateway can selectively offload some of the IPv4 traffic flows in the
   access network instead of tunneling back to the local mobility anchor
   in the home network.

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option     February 2013


1.  Introduction

   Mobile Operators are expanding their network coverage by integrating
   various access technology domains (Ex: Wireless LAN, CDMA, LTE) into
   a common IP mobility core.  The 3GPP S2a Proxy Mobile IPv6 [TS23402]
   reference point, specified by the 3GPP system architecture defines
   the protocol inter-working for building such integrated multi-access
   network.  In this scenario, the mobile node's IP traffic is always
   tunneled back from the mobile access gateway [RFC5213] in the access
   network to the local mobility anchor in the home network.  Currently,
   there is no mechanism for allowing some of the subscriber's IP flows
   to be offloaded in the access network.

   With the exponential growth in the mobile data traffic, mobile
   operators are exploring new ways to offload some of the IP traffic
   flows at the nearest access edge.  The offload is intended either for
   local service access in the access network, or for internet offload
   through the access network when there is an internet peering point.
   Not all IP traffic flows needs to be routed back to the home network,
   some of the non-essential traffic which does not require IP mobility
   support can be offloaded at the mobile access gateway in the access
   network.  This approach allows efficient usage of the mobile packet
   core which helps in lowering transport costs.  The local mobility
   anchor in the home network can deliver the IP flow policy to the
   mobile access gateway in the access network, for identifying the IP
   flows that need to be offloaded.  It's a policy decision as to which
   traffic an operator deems as non-essential.  One operator might
   choose to offload everything except traffic (such as Voice over IP)
   that requires QoS services.  Another might choose to offload only
   HTTP traffic.  From the point of view of this specification, it is
   only about IP traffic matching a given flow selector and
   classification for offload.  This approach has one limitation with
   respect to identifying encrypted traffic: IPsec encrypted traffic
   with no visibility into the application payload cannot be selected
   for offload.

   This document defines a new mobility option, IPv4 Traffic Offload
   Selector option (Section 3.1) for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  This
   option can be used by the local mobility anchor for delivering the
   IPv4 traffic offload policy associated with a mobility session to the
   mobile access gateway.  This IPv4 traffic offload policy identifies
   the flow selectors that can used for selecting the flows for
   offloading them at the access edge.  Since, the mobile node's IP
   address topologically belongs to the home network, the offloaded IPv4
   traffic flows may need to be NAT [RFC2663] translated.  These
   offloaded flows will not have mobility support as the NAT becomes the
   anchor point for those flows.  However, when the traffic is offloaded
   for local service access as opposed to internet offload, NAT

Internet-Draft    IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option     February 2013


   translation may not be needed, if the mobile access gateways is in
   path for the return traffic.  The decision on when to apply NAT
   translation can be based on local configuration on the mobile access
   gateway.  There are better ways to address the offload problem for
   IPv6 and with the goal not to create NAT66 requirement, this
   specification therefore does not support traffic offload support for
   IPv6 flows.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the
   following terms:

   IP Flow

      IP Flow [RFC5101] represents a set of IP packets that match a
      traffic selector.  The selector is typically based on the source
      IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port
      and other fields in upper layer headers.

   IP Traffic Offload

      The approach of selecting specific IP flows and routing them
      through the access network, instead of tunneling them to the home
      network.  Offload can also be between two access networks
      (Example: moving some of the traffic from LTE access to WLAN
      access).


3.  Solution Overview

   Figure 1 illustrates the scenario where the mobile access gateway in
   an access network has enabled IPv4 traffic offload support for a
   mobility session.  The offload decision is based on the IPv4 traffic
   offload policy that it negotiated with the local mobility anchor in
   the home network.  For example, all the HTTP flows may be offloaded
   at the mobile access gateway and all the other flows for that

   mobility session are tunneled back to the local mobility anchor.  The
   offloaded flows have to be typically NAT translated and this
   specification does not impose any restrictions on the location of the
   NAT function.  It is possible for the NAT function to be co-located
   with the mobile access gateway or located somewhere in the edge of
   the access network.  When the NAT is not co-located on the mobile
   access gateway, the NAT function should have the ability to identify
   the offloaded IPv4 traffic for NAT policy enforcement.  This could be
   achieved by configuring a specific VLAN between the mobile access
   gateway and the NAT device and ensuring all the traffic on that VLAN
   is NAT translated.  This can also be achieved through other means and
   the details are outside the scope of this document.  It is also to be
   noted that the NAT translation is not required if the offloaded IPv4
   flows are for local service access.

   The traffic selectors in the IPv4 traffic offload policy are used to
   classify the traffic, so it can be offloaded to the access network.
   These parameters include Source IP address, Destination IP address,
   TCP/UDP Port numbers, and other fields.  The format of the IPv4
   Binary Traffic Selector is specified in section 3.1 of [RFC6088].

3.1.  IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector Option

   A new mobility option, IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option, is
   defined for using it in Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) messages exchanged between a mobile access
   gateway and a local mobility anchor.  This option is used for
   carrying the IPv4 traffic offload policy.  This policy identifies the
   IPv4 traffic flow selectors that can be used by the mobile access
   gateway for enforcing the offload policy.

   The alignment requirement for this option is 4n.

   Offload Mode (M) Flag
      This field indicates the offload mode.

         If the (M) flag value is set to a value of (0), it is an
         indication that the IPv4 flow(s) matching the traffic selectors
         in the Traffic Selector sub-option [RFC6089] and that are
         associated to that mobility session have to be offloaded at the
         mobile access gateway.  All the other IPv4 flows associated
         with that mobility session and not matching the traffic
         selectors have to be tunneled to the local mobility anchor.

         If the (M) flag value is set to a value of (1), it is an
         indication that all the IPv4 flows associated to that mobility
         session except the IPv4 flow(s) matching the traffic selectors
         in the Traffic Selector sub-option have to be offloaded at the
         mobile access gateway.  All the other IPv4 flows associated
         with that mobility session and not matching the traffic
         selectors have to be tunneled back to the local mobility
         anchor.

   Reserved
      This field is unused for now.  The value MUST be initialized to 0
      by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Traffic Selector Sub-option
      The traffic selector sub-option includes the parameters used to
      match packets for a specific flow binding.  This is an optional
      sub-option when the IPv4 Traffic Selector option is carried in a
      Proxy Binding Update message, but is a mandatory sub-option when
      the IPv4 Traffic Selector option is carried in a Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message.  The format of the Traffic Selector sub-
      option is defined in section 4.2.1.4 of [RFC6089].  This sub-
      option includes a TS Format field, which identifies the format of
      the flow specification included in that sub-option.  The values
      for that field are defined in section 3 of [RFC6089] and are
      repeated here for completeness.  When the value of TS Format field
      is set to (1), the format that follows is the IPv4 Binary Traffic
      Selector specified in section 3.1 of [RFC6088] and that support is
      mandatory for this specification.  The text specified in this
      section takes precedence over what is specified in [RFC6088] and
      [RFC6089].

3.2.  MAG Considerations

   o  If the mobile access gateway is configured to support IPv4 Traffic
      Offload support, then it SHOULD include the IPv4 Traffic Offload
      Selector option (Section 3.1) in the Proxy Binding Update message
      that it sends to the local mobility anchor.  Optionally, the
      mobile access gateway can also propose a specific offload policy.

      *  The mobile access gateway MAY choose not to propose any
         specific IPv4 traffic offload policy but request the local
         mobility anchor for the offload policy.  In this scenario, the
         IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option that is carried in the
         Proxy Binding Update message MUST NOT include the Traffic
         Selector sub-option (Section 3.1) and the (M) flag Section 3.1
         in the option MUST be set to value of (0).  Including the IPv4
         Traffic Offload Selector option in the Proxy Binding Update
         without the Traffic Selector Sub-option serves as an indication
         that the mobile access gateway is not proposing any specific
         offload policy for that mobility session, but rather it makes a
         request to the local mobility anchor to provide the offload
         policy.

      *  The mobile access gateway MAY choose to propose a specific IPv4
         traffic offload policy by including the Traffic Selector sub-
         option in the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option Section 3.1.
         The specific details on how the mobile access gateway obtains
         the mobile node's IPv4 traffic offload policy, is outside the
         scope of this document.  When this offload policy is included
         in the Proxy Binding Update message, it serves as a proposal to
         the local mobility anchor, which the local mobility anchor can
         override with its own offload policy, or agree to the proposed
         policy.  The offload policy has to be translated to a set of
         selectors that can be used to match the mobile node's IP flows
         and these selectors have to be carried in the Traffic Selector
         Sub-option.  The Traffic Selector sub-option MUST be
         constructed as specified section 4.2.1.4 of [RFC6089].  This
         sub-option includes a Traffic Selector Format field, which
         identifies the format of the flow specification included in
         that sub-option.  The values for that field and the
         corresponding message format are defined in section 3.0 of
         [RFC6088].  Considerations from Section 3.1 apply with respect
         to setting the Offload Mode (M) flag.

   o  When sending a Proxy Binding Update either for Binding lifetime
      extension, or for Binding De-Registration, the mobile access
      gateway SHOULD copy the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option from
      the initial Proxy Binding Update message.  Considerations from
      section 6.9.1.3 [RFC5213] and section 6.9.1.4 [RFC5213] MUST be

      applied.

   o  If the mobile access gateway is not configured to support IPv4
      traffic offload support as specified in this specification, but if
      the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message has the IPv4
      Traffic Offload Selector option, then the mobile access gateway
      MUST ignore the option and process the rest of the message as per
      [RFC5213].

   o  If there is no IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in the Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgement message received from the local mobility
      anchor, it is indication that the local mobility anchor did not
      enable IPv4 Traffic Offload support for that mobility session.
      The mobile access gateway upon accepting the Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message SHOULD NOT enable IPv4 traffic offload
      support for that mobility session.

   o  If there is an IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in the Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgement message, then the mobile access gateway
      SHOULD enable the IPv4 traffic offload support for that mobility
      session.  The mobility access gateway has to provision the data
      plane using the flow selectors present in the Traffic Selector
      Sub-option.  The IPv4 flows matching the flow selectors have to be
      offloaded, or tunneled back based to the local mobility anchor
      based on the value of the Offload Mode (M) flag Section 3.1.

3.3.  LMA Considerations

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update message does not include the
      IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option (Section 3.1), then the local
      mobility anchor MUST NOT enable IPv4 Traffic Offload support for
      that mobility session and the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
      message that will be sent in response MUST NOT contain the IPv4
      Traffic Offload Selector option.

   o  If the Proxy Binding Update message includes the IPv4 Traffic
      Offload Selector option, but if the local mobility anchor is not
      configured to support IPv4 Traffic Offload support, then the local
      mobility anchor MUST ignore the option and process the rest of the
      message as per [RFC5213].  This would have no effect on the
      operation of the rest of the protocol.

   o  If the Proxy Binding Update message has the IPv4 Traffic Offload
      Selector option and if the local mobility anchor is configured to
      support IPv4 Traffic Offload support, then the local mobility
      anchor MUST enable IPv4 Traffic Offload support for that mobility
      session.  The Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message that will be
      sent in response MUST include the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector

      option.  The following considerations apply with respect to
      constructing the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option.

      *  The local mobility anchor can obtain the offload policy from
         the local configuration store, or from a network function such
         as from AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting), or
         PCRF (Policy Charging and Rules Function)).  The offload policy
         has to be translated to a set of selectors that can be used to
         match the mobile node's IP flows and these selectors have to be
         carried in the Traffic Selector Sub-option.  The Traffic
         Selection Sub-option MUST be constructed as specified in
         section 4.2.1.4 of [RFC6089].  Considerations from Section 3.1
         apply with respect to Offload Mode Flag (M) setting.

      *  If the Proxy Binding Update message includes a specific IPv4
         Traffic Offload policy proposal in the form of Traffic Selector
         Sub-option [RFC6089], then the local mobility anchor MAY choose
         to agree to that request by including the same IPv4 Traffic
         Offload policy in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.
         This implies the local mobility anchor has agreed to the mobile
         access gateway provided IPv4 Traffic Offload policy.  The local
         mobility anchor MAY also choose to override the request by
         including a different IPv4 Traffic Offload policy that it wants
         the mobile access gateway to enforce for that mobility session.
         This is entirely based on the policy configuration on the local
         mobility anchor.

      *  The IPv4 traffic offload policy that is sent to the mobile
         access gateway has to be specific to the mobility session
         identified using the Mobile Node Identifier option [RFC5213].
         The offload policy MUST be specific to a mobile node's
         application traffic.  The traffic selectors have to match only
         the mobile node's application traffic and MUST NOT match any
         other mobile node's IP traffic.  Furthermore, control plane
         traffic such as DHCP, ND or any other IP traffic that is used
         for IP address configuration, mobility management or for other
         control plane functions has to be excluded.

      *  The local mobility anchor MUST NOT make any changes to the
         mobile node's offload policy during the middle of a mobility
         session, as that might break some of the IP sessions.
         Therefore the IPv4 Traffic Selector option with the Traffic
         Selector sub-option that is delivered during the initial
         mobility signaling signaling MUST be the same as the one that
         is delivered as part of the mobility signaling related to
         lifetime extension.

4.  Protocol Configuration Variables

   This specification defines the following configuration variable that
   controls the IPv4 Traffic Offload support feature.  This
   configuration variable is internal to the system and has no bearing
   on interoperability across different implementations.

   The mobility entities, local mobility anchor and the mobile access
   gateway have to allow these variables to be configured by the system
   management.  The configured values for these protocol variables have
   to survive server reboots and service restarts.

   EnableIPv4TrafficOffloadSupport

         This flag indicates whether or not IPv4 Traffic Offload support
         needs to be enabled.  This configuration variable is available
         at both in the mobile access gateway and at the local mobility
         anchor.  The default value for this flag is set to (0),
         indicating that the support for IPv4 Traffic offload support is
         disabled.

         When this flag on the mobile access gateway is set to a value
         of (1), the mobile access gateway has to enable the IPv4
         Traffic offload support for all mobility sessions, specifically
         request the IPv4 traffic offload policy from the local mobility
         anchor by including the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in
         the Proxy Binding Update message.  If the flag is set to a
         value of (0), the mobile access gateway has to disable support
         for IPv4 Traffic Offload support for all mobility sessions.

         Similarly, when this flag on the local mobility anchor is set
         to a value of (1), the local mobility anchor has to enable
         support for IPv4 Traffic offload support.  When the local
         mobility anchor chooses to enable IPv4 Traffic offload support
         and if there is offload policy specified for a mobile node, it
         has to deliver the IPv4 traffic offload policy to the mobile
         access gateway by including the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector
         option in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA action.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new mobility option, IPv4
      Traffic Offload Selector option.  This option is described in
      Section 3.1.  The Type value for this option needs to be assigned
      from the same numbering space as allocated for the other mobility

      options [RFC6275].

   o  RFC Editor: Please replace <IANA-1> in Section 4 with the assigned
      value, and update this section accordingly.


6.  Security Considerations

   The IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option defined in this
   specification is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement messages.  This option is carried like any other
   mobility header option as specified in [RFC5213].  Therefore it
   inherits from [RFC5213] its security guidelines and does not require
   any additional security considerations.  Carrying IPv4 traffic
   offload selectors does not introduce any new security
   vulnerabilities.

   When IPv4 traffic offload support is enabled for a mobile node, the
   mobile access gateway selectively offloads some of the mobile node's
   IPv4 traffic flows to the access network.  Typically, these offloaded
   flows get NAT translated and essentially that introduces certain
   vulnerabilities which are common to any NAT deployment.  These
   vulnerabilities and the related considerations have been well
   documented in the NAT specification [RFC2663].  There are no
   additional considerations above and beyond what has already been
   documented by the NAT specifications and which are unique to the
   approach specified in this document.

   The mobile node's home network may be equipped with firewall and
   other security devices to guard against any security threats.  When
   IPv4 traffic offload support is enabled, it potentially exposes the
   mobile node to some security risks in the access network.  This
   threat can be mitigated by deploying the security features in the
   access network as in the home network.

   When IPv4 traffic offload support is enabled for a mobile node, some
   of the IP flows are sent through the home network and some other IP
   flows are routed through the access network.  This potentially
   introduces some complexity with respect to enabling diagnostics or
   monitoring on the user traffic.  The tools that are used for such
   diagnostics have to be aware of the offload policy that in enabled in
   the network.
