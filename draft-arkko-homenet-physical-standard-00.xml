<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Support for network technology in buildings varies greatly
depending on the age of the building. Older buildings may have no
wiring to support any network infrastructure, power may be available
only at select places, and so on. Newer buildings can generally 
support some wired networking mechanisms and provide space and power
for the necessary equipment.</t>

<t>But the ease of building a home network is also highly dependent on
the chosen wiring, power, and equipment space designs. As networking
technology evolves at a fast pace, it is important to choose designs
that are expected to be useful for a long time. A well-designed
network architecture at the physical, cabling, power, and equipment
space level could support anything from plain old telephone systems to
broadband IP networks, IP-based TV systems, and home automation. The
underlying physical infrastructure should not be impacted by
technology evolution such as moving from traditional telephony to
transporting voice over IP networks, variations in employing
either Ethernet switching, routing, and network address translation, moving
from IPv4 to IPv6, and so on.</t>

<t>While there are many cabling, equipment, and protocol standards, to
date there has been no standard for the physical network layout for
new buildings. This memo sets a baseline requirements that new,
single-family residences must satisfy in order to benefit from
advances in networking technology. The basic requirements call for
using general purpose cabling in a star topology and providing space
for equipment in an equipment rack, and sufficient power supply.</t>

<t>Standardizing network technology for buildings is a challenging
task, however. This memo has been submitted for the home networking
working group at the IETF as one forum that the authors were able
to find that appears to care about the home network as a
system. However, in general the IETF has expertise only on protocols,
not on the physical medium, equipment racks, power supplies, or civil
engineering and building requirements.</t>

<t>Similarly, cabling standards bodies have experience only on the
physical medium but not its application in a specific context, civil
engineering standards bodies have only experience on buildings and not
on networking requirements, equipment form factor and rack
specifications are not specified for a particular home network
context, and so on.</t>

<t>As a result, it is unclear what forum would have the right
expertise to discuss this. Advice is sought on what existing standards
already address this problem, what standardization efforts may be
under way, and if work remains, what the right forum to discuss these
matters might be.</t>

<t>The rest of this memo is organized as follows. <xref target="kwd"/>
defines the requirements language. <xref target="motivation"/>
discusses the motivation for needing any physical infrastructure
beyond wireless in houses. <xref target="layout"/> specifies the
required network layout and minimum capacity, <xref target="cabling"/>
specifies the use of Category 6 cabling, and <xref target="rack"/>
specifies the requirements for equipment space and power. Finally,
<xref target="seccons"/> outlines brief security requirements for
house networks.</t>

<t>Buildings that satisfy the minimum requirements are said to be
compliant with this specification. Many buildings may support
additional facilities, however, and some of the optional requirements
are discussed throughout the memo. Note that requirements for
commercial buildings, apartment buildings, and special purpose
residences such as summer homes are slightly different, and not
covered in this specification.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="kwd" title='Requirements language'>

  <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
  NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
  in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
  <xref target="RFC2119"/>. </t>

</section>

<section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">

<t>A frequently asked question is whether a wired infrastructure is
needed at all, given the existence of fast and inexpensive wireless
networking. End user computing equipment such as laptops employ
largely wireless networking today, and the trend is expected to
continue, and even accelerate, with other types of devices as
well. However, there are several reasons why the existence of a base
wired infrastructure within a building is still essential
complement to wireless technology:

<list style="symbols">

<t>The need to support applications such as video surveillance,
IP-based TV, or network-connected backup storage that may exceed the
capacity of at least the current generation of wireless
technology.</t>

<t>The need to support applications that benefit from
Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) and other similar technologies that can be
implemented only over wired infrastructure.</t>

<t>The need to support legacy technologies, such as plain old
telephones and other devices that can benefit from wired
connectivity.</t>

<t>Reconnecting parts from different areas of the house. For instance,
the Internet connection, the best place for a wireless LAN access point, and
the desired place for an IP-based TV device may all be in different
areas of the house.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>

Connecting these different locations is possible over
wireless as well, but it is typically more efficient to
use a wired infrastructure.</t>

<t>A wireless access point infrastructure is often easiest built on
top of a wired infrastructure that connects to the access
points.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>

While typical homes today cope with a much simpler
architecture that needs no infrastructure or multiple access points,
evolving wireless technology generally tends to decrease cell size
while increasing bandwidth. Future local area wireless technology or
even light-based communication mechanisms may make use of multiple
access points in a far more aggressive manner than today's 802.11
wireless LANs.</t>

<t>Ability to employ future networking technology innovations that may
also require wired connectivity. As an example, one of the authors has
deployed sensor network on top of wired infrastructure in his
home.</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>Another frequent question is whether there is a need for a
dedicated space to place equipment in. While technology evolves at a
fast pace and is also being embedded in all of our devices, it is
expected that some central equipment, such as routers, ADSL modems, or
Power-over-Ethernet feeds will also be needed in the future. It is
easier to place these devices in a dedicated space that can be
engineered to provide the necessary power and connectivity. In
addition, a dedicated space can be designed to prevent the equipment
from causing a visual or aural distraction to the occupants of the
building.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="layout" title='Network Layout'>

<t>The network MUST use a structured cabling model and a star
topology. Note that single-family homes are typically well within the
maximum cable length limits even in this configuration. Exceptional
situations, such as secondary buildings MAY be handled through the
addition of extra local star configurations for the other
buildings.</t>

<t>All external wired connectivity to the building MUST be brought to
the same space that holds the center of the star. For instance,
fiber-optic cables and phone cables are brought here so that they can
be easily connected to the routers, switches and other devices in the
central equipment space.</t>

<t>This model ensures that individual devices can be connected despite
changes in networking technology, merely by reconfiguring the central
cable cross connect panel appropriately. For instance, individual
devices within the house get to have full-speed connectivity to the
central equipment and the technology used to communicate to one device
is not dependent on another device.</t>

<t>At least one wired connection MUST be provided in this topology for
every primary room. This includes the living room, kitchen, bedrooms,
libraries, offices, media rooms, and other rooms where the occupants
may spend significant amount of time. These rooms are likely to have a
computer or a media device that needs connectivity either directly or
via a wireless access point device placed nearby.</t>

<t>Connections MUST also be provided in rooms dedicated to technology,
such as as heating or technology rooms or closets. It is expected that
these rooms employ technology that benefits from smart energy or
safety applications that may benefit from connectivity.</t>

<t>Connections MUST also be provided in hallways or entrance rooms
associated with the primary entrance, as those areas may employ
movement sensors, surveillance cameras, home automation panels or
other technology that again may benefit from connectivity.</t>

<t>Connections MAY also be provided in additional areas such as
storage rooms, hallways, bathrooms, basement, attic, and so on, but it
is not strictly required. The expected applications in these areas
typically relate to safety and building health monitoring.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="cabling" title='Cabling'>

<t>The network MUST use cables manufactured and installed according to
the Category 6 specifications <xref target="TIA.568-B.2"/>. This
allows high-speed networking applications such as Gigabit or even 10
Gigabit Ethernet <xref target="IEEE.802-3ab.1999"/>, as well as many
other uses (including legacy voice services and surveillance
applications).</t>

<t>Note that a more stringent cabling standard MAY be used for all the
cabling, as long as it is compatible with Category 6. In addition, the
network MAY use other types of cables as seen appropriate. For
instance, the installation of fiber optic cabling within the building
may be useful, even if it is not something that should be recommended
today as the only cabling model.</t>

<t>Cabling SHOULD be installed in manner that makes it possible to
replace or upgrade the cables to future standards. For instance,
cables can be installed in tubes, cabling shafts, or other conduits
where they can be replaced without affecting the structures around
them. In general, the expected lifetime of buildings should be from 30
to 100 years or even beyond.  While current installations are likely
to be useful in 20 years time, it is also likely that either the
physical lifetime of the cabling or the suitability of today's cables
to future applications demands replacement after some number of
decades.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="rack" title='Space and Power'>

<t>The house needs to provide sufficient space and power for placing
equipment, such as modems, routers, and file servers. Each star center
point in the network topology MUST employ a 19 inch rack system <xref
target="IEC.60297-3-100"/>. The rack system MUST be at least 22U (97.9
centimeters) high and at least 600 millimeters deep.</t>

<t>There are no mandatory requirements on the configuration of the
rack, but it is RECOMMENDED that space in the rack be provided for
Category 6 cable termination panels, a power panel, shelves for
freestanding equipment, as well as some free space for rack-attached
equipment.

<list style="empty">
<t>For instance, a 22U system could be used to accommodate a 2U
termination panel for 32 cables, a 24-port 1U Ethernet Switch, 1U
power panel, 2 shelves both taking up 4U space, and 10U remaining
space for rack-attached equipment. It is useful to reserve a free shelf
at the top of the rack with enough free space above it so
that larger equipment, such as standalone PCs can be accommodated.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Common industry standard of 900 millimeters deep racks may be
unnecessarily space-consuming for home environments, however. The
depth of 600 millimeters is sufficient for many types of equipment
(small switches are typically 200 to 300 millimeters deep, for
instance), even if it may not be sufficient for high end servers and
other full-size equipment. A smaller form factor rack standard might
be useful for home environments.
</t>
</list></t>

<t>The placement of the rack shall be according to the relevant
building codes and practices. Often the rack is placed in a technology
room that houses other equipment as well such as electrical
cabinets.</t>

<t>In addition, mains power MUST be provided for the equipment
space. This power MUST be fed from an dedicated circuit breaker and
SHOULD be filtered to prevent equipment damage from thunderstorms and
similar phenomena.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="seccons" title='Security Considerations'>

   <t>While communications equipment does not have the same electrical
   safety concerns as electricity cabinets, it is still RECOMMENDED
   that the equipment cabinets are protected from children and
   accidental tampering. This can be accomplished with a lockable
   door, for instance.</t>

   <t>Safety critical applications SHOULD employ connectivity that
   matches the security requirements. For instance, fire and burglary
   alarms, and medical applications should use either strong
   cryptographic security over the wireless medium, or cabling that is
   not easily tampered with by outsiders. For instance, burglary alarm
   systems should not rely on cabling that is routed unprotected
   outside the building.</t>
