Abstract

   The demands on the networking infrastructure and thus the
   switch/router bandwidths are growing exponentially; the drivers are
   bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter data center
   communications etc. Using sampling techniques, for a given sampling
   rate, the amount of samples that need to be processed is increasing
   exponentially especially for applications like security threat
   detection. This draft elaborates on flow-state dependent packet
   selection techniques and the relevant information models. It
   describes how these techniques can be effectively used to reduce the
   number of samples for applications like security threat detection.

Internet-Draft  Flow Aware Packet Sampling Techniques      October 2013


1. Introduction

   This draft expands on the flow-state dependent packet selection
   techniques described in [RFC 7014] for identifying long-lived large
   flows and the relevant information models. This draft also describes
   a practical use case for efficient behavioral security detection,
   like Denial of Service (DOS) attacks etc., using flow-state dependent
   packet selection techniques.

   flow(s)

2. Flow-state dependent packet selection techniques

   Expanding on the work in [RFC 7014] and [RFC 5475], this draft
   suggests additional techniques for flow-state dependent packet
   selection for identifying large flows. One of these techniques is
   called Multistage Filters which is described in [ESVA]. This
   technique helps in automatically identifying large flows with a low
   false positive rate. This technique can be implemented as an inline
   solution in switches/routers and would be expected to operate at line
   rate.

   Besides the Multistage filters technique described in [ESVA],

   1) The technique suggested in [VRM] is also applicable. [VRM]
     suggests techniques for automatically identifying large flows

     using rotating conservative counting Bloom filters with periodic
     decay. This technique has a low false positive rate in large flow
     misidentification.

   2) The sample and hold technique suggested in [ESVA] is also
     applicable. This technique has a low false positive rate in large
     flow misidentification.

   The large flows which are automatically identified using the above
   techniques are populated in the IPFIX flow cache [RFC 6728]. If a
   large flow already exists in the IPFIX flow cache, the above
   techniques are not applied - this is the reason these are called
   flow-state dependent packet selection techniques.

   Please note that there is a finite probability of small flows being
   misidentified as large flows. These are handled as described in the
   section 2.2 "Handling Inactive/Misidentified Large Flows".

2.1. Information Model for flow-state dependent packet selection
   technique configuration

   From a bandwidth and time duration perspective, in order to identify
   large flows we define an observation interval and observe the
   bandwidth of the flow over that interval.  A flow that exceeds a
   certain minimum bandwidth threshold over that observation interval
   would be considered a large flow.

   The two configuration parameters -- the observation interval, and the
   minimum bandwidth threshold over that observation interval -- should
   be programmable in a switch or a router to facilitate handling of
   different use cases and traffic characteristics are defined below.

   largeFlowObservationInterval: The minimum time interval to observe a
   flow before performing further processing of the flow. Unit is in
   milliseconds.

   largeFlowBandwidthThreshold: The minimum bandwidth of the flow during
   the observation interval for declaring the flow a large flow. Unit is
   in Mbps.

   For example, a flow which is at or above 10 Mbps for a time period of
   at least 30 seconds could be declared a large flow.

2.2. Handling Inactive/Misidentified Large Flows

   Once a flow has been recognized as a large flow, it should continue
   to be recognized as a large flow as long as the traffic received
   during an observation interval exceeds some fraction of the bandwidth
   threshold, for example 80% of the bandwidth threshold. If the traffic
   received during an observation interval falls below a fraction of the
   bandwidth threshold, the large flow should be removed from the IPFIX
   flow cache.

2.3. Flow-state dependent packet selection - sample and hold

   [RFC 7014] suggests some information model parameters for the sample
   and hold technique suggested in [ESVA]. The large flow information
   model parameters suggested in section 2.1 are complementary to these.

3. Current sampling techniques for security threat detection

   Packet sampling techniques e.g. PSAMP -- [RFC 5474], [RFC 5475], [RFC
   5476], [RFC 5477], in switches and routers provide an effective
   mechanism for approximate detection of various types of flows --
   long-lived large flows and other flows (which include long-lived
   small flows, short-lived small/large flows) with minimal packet
   replication bandwidth overhead. The packet sampling techniques sample
   all flows equally.

   A large percentage of the packet samples comprise of long-lived large
   (aka large) flows and a small percentage of the packet samples
   comprise of other (aka small) flows. The large flows aka top-talkers
   consume a large percentage of the bandwidth and small percentage of
   the flow space.

   The small flows, which are the typical cause of security threats like
   Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, scanning attacks etc., consume a
   small percentage of the bandwidth and a large percentage of the flow
   space.

4. Application of flow-state dependent packet selection techniques for
   security threat detection

   Using the flow-state dependent packet selection techniques described
   in Section 2, the large flows or top-talkers can be detected in real-
   time with a high degree of accuracy. Only the small flows need to be
   sampled -- this makes security threat detection more effective with
   minimal sampling overhead.

   The steps in security threat detection are described below

   1) Large Flow Identification:

     For identifying large flows, use the flow-state dependent packet
     selection techniques described in Section 2. This helps in
     identifying the large flows aka top-talkers in real-time with a
     high degree of accuracy.

   2) Large Flow Classification:

     The identified large flows can be broadly classified into 2
     categories as detailed below.

        a.  Well behaved (steady rate) large flows, e.g. video streams

        b.  Bursty (fluctuating rate) large flows e.g. Peer-to-Peer
          traffic

     The large flows can be sampled at a low rate for further analysis
     or need not be sampled. If desired, the large flows could be
     exported to a central entity, e.g. Netflow Collector, using IPFIX
     protocol [RFC 7011] for further analysis.

   3) Small Flow Processing:

     The small flows (excluding the large flows) can be sampled at a
     normal rate. The small flows can be examined for determining
     security threats like DOS attacks (for e.g. SYN floods), Scanning
     attacks etc. [FDDOS, PDSN, and ALDS]

   Thus, we can see that, security threat detection is possible with
   minimal sampling overhead.

4.1. Analysis of various flow-state dependent packet selection
   techniques

   The multistage filter technique suggested in [ESVA] for automatic
   identification works well for standard applications generating large
   flows, for e.g. video content like movies and catch-up episodes,
   backup transactions etc. with a detection time of approximately 30-60
   seconds. These detection times ensure that short-lived large flows,
   for e.g. HD video clips, are not unnecessarily recognized.

   If faster large flow identification times are desired (much shorter
   than 30s), the multistage filter technique suggested in [ESVA] may
   pose the following problem that the effective filtered flow size is
   phase-dependent: that is, relatively smaller constant-rate flows, for
   e.g. HD video clips, beginning early within a counting Bloom filter
   reset interval would be unnecessarily detected with the same
   probability as relatively larger flows beginning toward the interval.
   [VRM] suggests techniques for addressing the above problem using
   rotating conservative counting Bloom filters with periodic decay.

4.2. Simulation

   Simulation results for these flow-state dependent packet selection
   techniques are presented in Appendix A. The goal of the simulation is
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques for security
   threat detection in a multi-tenant video streaming data center.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not directly impact the security of the Internet
   infrastructure or its applications. In fact, it proposes techniques
   which could help in identifying a DOS attack pattern.

6. Operational Considerations

   For effectively using the flow-state dependent packet selection
   techniques, the operator should adjust the programmable parameters
   largeFlowObservationInterval and largeFlowBandwidthThreshold in
   switches/routers based on the applications which are being deployed.

   Demonstrate the effectiveness of flow aware packet sampling in a
   practical use case, for e.g. multi-tenant video streaming in a data
   center.

   Test Topology:

   Multiple virtual servers (server hosted on a virtual machine)
   connected to a virtual switch (vSwitch) which in turn connects to the
   data center network using a 10Gbps ethernet interface.

   2 virtual servers are active.

   First virtual server

     .  Traffic types

          o HD MPEG-4 video streams (bit rate 10Mbps) - 100 - 1Gbps

          o SD MPEG-2 video streams (bit rate 4Mbps) - 300 - 1.2Gbps

          o Other traffic - 500Mbps (Video clips, DOS attacks (for e.g.
             SYN floods), Scanning attacks etc.)

     .  Aggregate traffic - 2.7Gbps

   Second virtual server

     .  Traffic types

          o HD MPEG-4 video streams (bit rate 10Mbps) - 50 - .5Gbps

          o SD MPEG-2 video streams (bit rate 4Mbps) - 500 - 2.0Gbps

          o Backup transaction - 100Mbps

          o Other traffic - 500Mbps (Video clips, DOS attacks (for e.g.
             SYN floods), Scanning attacks etc.)

     .  Aggregate traffic - 3.1Gbps

   Total traffic on 2 servers - 5.8Gbps

   Existing techniques:

   Normal sampling rate - 1:1000

   Total sampled traffic = 5.8Gbps/1000 = 5.8Mbps

   Flow aware sampling technique:

   Large flow recognition parameters

     .  Observation interval for large flow - 60 seconds

     .  Minimum bandwidth threshold over the observation interval -
        2Mbps

   Aggregate bit rate of large flows = 4.8Gbps

   Aggregate bit rate of small flows = 1Gbps

   Low sampling rate of large flows - 1:10000

   Normal sampling rate of small flows - 1:1000

   Total sampled traffic = 4.8Gbps/10000 + 1Gbps/1000 = 1.48Mbps

   Percentage improvement in sampling (most of the samples are only
   small flows) = (5.8 - 1.48)/5.8 ~= 78%

   The small flows can be examined in a central entity like Netflow
   Collector for determining security threats like DOS attacks, Scanning
   attacks etc. Thus, we can see that, security threat detection is
   possible with minimal sampling overhead.
