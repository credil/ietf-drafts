1.  Introduction

   The Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile is the common set
   of MPLS protocol functions defined to meet the requirements specified
   in [RFC5654].  The MPLS-TP Framework [RFC5921] provides an overall
   introduction to the MPLS-TP and defines the general architecture of
   the Transport Profile, as well as those aspects specific to point-to-
   point transport paths.  The purpose of this document is to define the
   elements and functions of the MPLS-TP architecture applicable
   specifically to supporting point-to-multipoint transport paths.

1.1.  Scope

   This document defines the elements and functions of the MPLS-TP
   architecture related to supporting point-to-multipoint transport
   paths.  The reader is referred to [RFC5921] for those aspects of the
   MPLS-TP architecture that are generic, or concerned specifically with
   point-to-point transport paths.

1.2.1.  Additional Definitions and Terminology

   Detailed definitions and additional terminology may be found in
   [RFC5921] and [RFC5654].

1.3.  Applicability

   The point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by an MPLS-TP network
   is based on the point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by MPLS
   networks.  P2MP MPLS TE-LSP support is discussed in [RFC4875] and
   [RFC5332], and P2MP PW support is being developed based on
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements] and
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpms-frmwk-requirements].  MPLS-TP point-to-
   multipoint connectivity is analogous to that provided by traditional
   transport technologies such as Optical Transport Network point-to-
   multipoint [G.798] and drop-and-continue [G.780], and thus supports
   the same class of traditional applications, e.g., video distribution.

   There is no definition for MPLS TE-LSP support of multipoint-to-
   multipoint connectivity and none is anticipated.

2.  MPLS Transport Profile Point-to-Multipoint Requirements

   The requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in [RFC5654], [RFC5860],
   and [RFC5951].  This section provides a brief summary of point-to-
   multipoint transport requirements as set out in those documents; the
   reader is referred to the documents themselves for the definitive and
   complete list of requirements.  This summary does not include the
   [RFC2119] conformance language used in original documents as this
   document is not authoritative.

   o  MPLS-TP must support unidirectional point-to-multipoint transport
      paths.

   o  MPLS-TP must support traffic-engineered point-to-multipoint
      transport paths.

   o  MPLS-TP must be capable of using P2MP server (sub)layer
      capabilities as well as P2P server (sub)layer capabilities when
      supporting P2MP MPLS-TP transport paths.

   o  The MPLS-TP control plane must support establishing all the
      connectivity patterns defined for the MPLS-TP data plane (i.e.,
      unidirectional P2P, associated bidirectional P2P, co-routed
      bidirectional P2P, unidirectional P2MP) including configuration of
      protection functions and any associated maintenance functions.

   o  Recovery techniques used for P2P and P2MP should be identical to
      simplify implementation and operation.

   o  Unidirectional 1+1 and 1:n protection for P2MP connectivity must
      be supported.

   o  MPLS-TP recovery in a ring must protect unidirectional P2MP
      transport paths.

3.  Architecture

   The overall architecture of the MPLS Transport Profile is defined in
   [RFC5921].  The architecture for point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP
   comprises the following additional elements and functions:

   o  Unidirectional point-to-multipoint LSPs

   o  Unidirectional point-to-multipoint PWs

   o  Optional point-to-multipoint LSP and PW control planes

   o  Survivability, network management, and Operations, Administration
      and Maintenance functions for point-to-multipoint PWs and LSPs

   The following subsections summarise the encapsulation and forwarding
   of point-to-multipoint traffic within an MPLS-TP network, and the
   encapsulation options for delivery of traffic to and from MPLS-TP CE
   devices when the network is providing a packet transport service.

3.1.  MPLS-TP Encapsulation and Forwarding

   Packet encapsulation and forwarding for MPLS-TP point-to-multipoint
   LSPs is identical to that for MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs.
   MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs were introduced in [RFC4875] and the
   related data-plane behaviour was further clarified in [RFC5332].
   MPLS-TP allows for both upstream-assigned and downstream-assigned
   labels for use with point-to-multipoint LSPs.

   Packet encapsulation and forwarding for point-to-multipoint PWs has
   been discussed within the PWE3 Working Group
   [I-D.raggarwa-pwe3-p2mp-pw-encaps], but such definition is for
   further study.

4.  Operations, Administration and Maintenance

   The overall OAM architecture for MPLS-TP is defined in [RFC6371], and
   P2MP OAM design considerations are described in Section 3.7 of that
   RFC.

   All the traffic sent over a P2MP transport path, including OAM
   packets generated by a MEP, is sent (multicast) from the root to all
   the leaves, thus every OAM packet is sent to all leaves, and thus can
   impact all the MEs in a P2MP MEG.  If an OAM packet is to be
   processed by only a specific leaf, it requires information to
   indicate to all other leaves that the packet must be discarded.  To
   address a packet to an intermediate node in the tree, TTL based
   addressing is used to set the radius and addressing information in
   the OAM payload is used to identify the specific destination node.

   P2MP paths are unidirectional; therefore, any return path to an
   originating MEP for on-demand transactions will be out-of-band.  Out
   of band return paths are discussed in Section 3.8 of [RFC5921].

   Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks [RFC6374] already
   considers the P2MP case and no change is needed to the MPLS-TP
   profile of [RFC6375].

   A more detailed discussion of P2MP OAM considerations can be found in
   [I-D.hmk-mpls-tp-p2mp-oam-framework].

5.  Control Plane

   The framework for the MPLS-TP control plane is provided in [RFC6373].
   This document reviews MPLS-TP control plane requirements as well as
   provides details on how the MPLS-TP control plane satisfies these
   requirements.  Most of the requirements identified in [RFC6373] apply
   equally to P2P and P2MP transport paths.  The key P2MP specific
   control plane requirements are:

   o  requirement 6 (P2MP transport paths),

   o  requirement 34 (use P2P sub-layers),

   o  requirement 49 (common recovery solutions for P2P and P2MP),

   o  requirement 59 (1+1 protection),

   o  requirement 62 (1:n protection),

   o  and requirement 65 (1:n shared mesh recovery).

   [RFC6373] defines the control plane approach used to support MPLS-TP
   transport paths.  It identifies GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-
   TP LSPs T-LDP as the control plane for PWs.  MPLS-TP allows that
   either, or both, LSPs and PWs to be provisioned statically or via a
   control plane.  As noted in [RFC6373]:

   The PW and LSP control planes, collectively, must satisfy the MPLS-TP
   control-plane requirements.  As with P2P services, when P2MP client
   services are provided directly via LSPs, all requirements must be
   satisfied by the LSP control plane.  When client services are
   provided via PWs, the PW and LSP control planes can operate in
   combination, and some functions may be satisfied via the PW control
   plane while others are provided to PWs by the LSP control plane.
   This is particularly noteworthy for P2MP recovery.

5.1.  Point-to-Multipoint LSP Control Plane

   The MPLS-TP control plane for point-to-multipoint LSPs uses GMPLS and
   is based on RSVP-TE for point-to-multipoint LSPs as defined in
   [RFC4875].  A detailed listing of how GMPLS satisfies MPLS-TP control
   plane requirements is provided in [RFC6373].

   Per [RFC6373], the definitions of P2MP, [RFC4875], and GMPLS
   recovery, [RFC4872] and [RFC4873], do not explicitly cover their
   interactions.  MPLS-TP requires a formal definition of recovery
   techniques for P2MP LSPs.  Such a formal definition will be based on
   existing RFCs and may not require any new protocol mechanisms but,

   nonetheless, should be documented.  Protection of P2MP LSPs is also
   discussed in [RFC6372] Section 4.7.3.

5.2.  Point-to-Multipoint PW Control Plane

   The MPLS-TP control plane for point-to-multipoint PWs should be based
   on the LDP control protocol used for point-to-point PWs [RFC4447],
   with updates as required for P2MP applications.  A detailed
   specification of the control plane for P2MP PWs is for further study.

6.  Survivability

   The overall survivability architecture for MPLS-TP is defined in
   [RFC6372], and section 4.7.3 in particular describes the application
   of linear protection to unidirectional P2MP entities using 1+1 and
   1:1 protection architecture.  For 1+1, the approach is for the root
   of the P2MP tree to bridge the user traffic to both the working and
   protection entities.  Each sink/leaf MPLS-TP node selects the traffic
   from one entity according to some predetermined criteria.  For 1:1,
   the source/root MPLS-TP node needs to identify the existence of a
   fault condition on any of the branches of the network.  Fault
   notification happens from the node identifying the fault to the root
   node and from the leaves to the root via an out of band path.  In
   either case the root then selects the protection transport path for
   traffic transfer.  More sophisticated survivability approaches such
   as partial tree protection and 1:n protection are for further study.

   The IETF has no experience with P2MP PW survivability as yet, and
   therefore it is proposed that the P2MP PW survivability will
   initially rely on the LSP survivability.  Further work is needed on
   this subject, particularly if a requirement emerges to provide
   survivability for P2MP PWs in an MPLS-TP context.

7.  Network Management

   An overview of network management considerations for MPLS-TP can be
   found in Section 3.14 of "Framework for MPLS in Transport Networks"
   [RFC5921].  The provided description applies equally to P2MP
   transport paths.

   The network management architecture and requirements for MPLS-TP are
   specified in [RFC5951].  They derive from the generic specifications
   described in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [G.7710] for transport technologies.
   They also incorporate the OAM requirements for MPLS Networks
   [RFC4377] and MPLS-TP Networks [RFC5860] and expand on those
   requirements to cover the modifications necessary for fault,
   configuration, performance, and security in a transport network.
   [RFC5951] covers all MPLS-TP connection types, including P2MP.

Internet-Draft    MPLS Transport Profile P2MP Framework     October 2013


   [RFC6639] provides the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP.  It
   reviews the interrelationships between different non MPLS-TP specific
   MIB modules that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network management, and
   identifies areas where additional MIB modules are required.  While
   the document does not consider P2MP transport paths, it does provide
   a foundation for an analysis of areas where MIB module modification
   and addition may be needed to fully support P2MP transport paths.
   There has also been work in the MPLS working group on a P2MP specific
   MIB, [I-D.ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-mib].

8.  Security Considerations

   General security considerations for MPLS-TP are covered in [RFC5921].
   Additional security considerations for point-to-multipoint LSPs are
   provided in [RFC4875].  This document introduces no new security
   considerations beyond those covered in those documents.

9.  IANA Considerations

   There are no requests for IANA actions in this document.
