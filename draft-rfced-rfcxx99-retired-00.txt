                     draft-rfced-rfcxx99-retired-00

Abstract

   Beginning in December 1991, a "Request for Comments Summary" was
   published every 100 RFCs.  RFC numbers ending with 99 were reserved
   for these summary documents.  This document retires the publication
   of the RFC summary documents.  Moving forward, RFC numbers ending in
   99 will be assigned to RFCs-to-be.

Internet-Draft     Retiring the RFC Summary Documents       January 2013


1.  Introduction

   In December 1991, RFC 1099 [RFC1099] was the first "Request for
   Comments Summary" RFC published.  It provides a list of document
   titles, authors, date of publication, and abstracts for each of the
   RFCs published in the range 1000 - 1099.  Since that time, though the
   time that RFC 3299 [RFC3299] was pubished, a new summary RFC was
   published every 100 RFCs, and RFC numbers ending with 99 were
   reserved for these summary documents.  RFC 3399 was never published
   (for various reasons), though RFCs 3499 [RFC3499] and 3599 [RFC3599]
   were.  RFC 3599 was the last of these summary documents to be
   published.

   Since the last summary document was published, the RFC Editor has not
   received any complaints regarding the summary documents not being
   available (other than a request to officially declare that the
   summary documents will not longer be published).  Additionaly, RFC
   abstracts are available using the RFC search engine.  These documents
   are not currently filling an Internet community need; therefore, this
   document retires the publication of the RFC summary documents.  RFC
   numbers ending in 99 may be assigned to RFCs-to-be moving forward.

2.  Cleaning Up RFC Editor Data

   As part of the cleanup related to retiring the summary documents, the
   RFC Editor will mark RFC 3399 as "never issued".  Additionally,
   numbers ending in 99 through RFC 6799 will be marked as "never
   issued".  Moving forward, RFC numbers typically reserved for these
   documents (i.e., those numbers ending with 99) may be assigned to
   future RFCs.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any IANA actions.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not impact the security of the Internet.
