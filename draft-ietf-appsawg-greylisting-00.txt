Internet-Draft            Email Greylisting BCP            December 2011


1.  Introduction

   There are many techniques in use for dealing with email abuse.  One
   is a set of techniques known as "greylisting".  Broadly, this refers
   to any degradation of service for an unknown or suspect source, over
   a period of time.  The narrow use of the term refers to generation of
   an SMTP temporary failure reply code for traffic from such sources.

   There are diverse implementations of this general technique, and,
   predictably therefore, some blurred terminology.

   This memo documents common greylisting techniques and discusses their
   benefits and costs.  It also defines terminology to enable clear
   distinction and discussion of these techniques.

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2.  E-Mail Architecture Terminology

   Readers should be familiar with the material and terminology
   discussed in [MAIL] and [EMAIL-ARCH].

3.  Benefits and Costs

   This section will discuss the benefits and also the costs (resources
   and impacts on generals ervice) of the various implementations.

   Discuss failure modes, including:

   o  all retries fail

   o  retries go to a different server that doesn't know about previous
      attempts

   o  retries come from a different client than earlier ones

   o  for systems that use body hashes, the retries aren't the same as
      the previous attempts

4.  Connection-Level Greylisting

   This section will talk about greylisting applied at the time of
   decision about whether or not to accept a new connection, even before
   SMTP begins to take place.

5.  SMTP HELO/EHLO Greylisting

   This section will talk about greylisting applied within the [SMTP]
   session at the HELO/EHLO phase.

6.  SMTP MAIL Greylisting

   This section will talk about greylisting applied within the [SMTP]
   session at the MAIL FROM phase.

7.  SMTP RCPT Greylisting

   This section will talk about greylisting applied within the [SMTP]
   session at the RCPT TO phase.

8.  SMTP DATA Greylisting

   This section will talk about greylisting applied within the [SMTP]
   session at the DATA phase.

   Some implementations do filtering here because there are clients that
   don't bother checking SMTP reply codes to commands other than DATA.

9.  Deciding Who Is Affected

   This section will discuss how it is decided whether or not a
   particular client session, or specific message, will be selected for
   greylisting.  Discuss selection criteria, e.g., {IP} vs. {IP, from,
   to}.

10.  Effects on Clients

   This section will discuss the behaviours of SMTP clients when
   greylisting is in effect, such as:

   o  very long retry times

   o  aggressive retries can hit rate limits

   o  incorrect handling of greylisting replies (e.g., treat 4xx like
      5xx)

   o  retries may change envelope sender

11.  Recommendations

   This section will provide some general recommendations about when and
   how to deploy greylisting in various conceptual environments.

   Some points to discuss:

   o  logging of a greylisting server vs. one not greylisting can be a
      good measure of how effective it is

   o  can also compare greylisting results to DNSBLs and content
      filtering

   o  greylisting is more expensive than not greylisting

   o  greylisting delays legitimate mail, and can cause conversations to
      arrive out of order

   o  time limits for greylisting

   o  special actions to take if the same message is retried before the
      time limit expires

   o  recommended termiantion methods (421 vs. 4xx)

   o  affects/requirements on MXes other than the lowest

   o  ability to share information between servers

12.  IANA Considerations

   No actions are requested of IANA in this memo.

13.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses potential security issues related to
   greylisting.
