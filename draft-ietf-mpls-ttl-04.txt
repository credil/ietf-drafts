This document describes Time To Live (TTL) processing in hierarchical
Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks and is motivated by the
need to formalize a TTL-transparent mode of operation for an MPLS
label-switched path.  It updates RFC 3032, "MPLS Label Stack
Encoding".  TTL processing in both Pipe and Uniform Model hierarchical
tunnels are specified with examples for both "push" and "pop" cases.
The document also complements RFC 3270, "MPLS Support of
Differentiated Services" and ties together the terminology introduced
in that document with TTL processing in hierarchical MPLS networks.

This document is a product of the Multiprotocol Label Switching
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
