    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an extension to PCP allowing clients to
        manipulate sets of ports as a whole. This is accomplished by a new
        MAP option: PORT_SET.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This section describes a few (and non-exhaustive) envisioned use cases.
        Note that the PCP extension defined in this document is generic and is
        expected to be applicable to other use cases.</t>

      <section title="Lightweight 4over6">

        <t>In the Lightweight 4over6 <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6"/> architecture,
          shared global addresses can be allocated to customers. It allows
          moving the Network Address Translation (NAT) function, otherwise
          accomplished by a Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) <xref
            target="RFC6888"/>, to the Customer-Premises Equipment (CPE). This
          provides more control over the NAT function to the user, and more
          scalability to the ISP.</t>

        <t>In the lw4o6 architecture, the PCP-controlled device corresponds to
          the lwAFTR, and the PCP client corresponds to the lwB4. The client
          sends a PCP MAP request containing a PORT_SET option to trigger shared
          address allocation on the lwAFTR. The PCP response contains the shared
          address information, including the port set allocated to the lwB4.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Applications Using Port Sets">

        <t>Some applications require not just one port, but a port set. One
          example is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent Server (UAS)
          <xref target="RFC3261"/> expecting to handle multiple concurrent
          calls, including media termination. When it receives a call, it needs
          to signal media port numbers to its peer. Generating individual PCP
          MAP requests for each of the media ports during call setup would
          introduce unwanted latency. Instead, the server can pre-allocate a set
          of ports such that no PCP exchange is needed during call setup.</t>

        <t>Using PORT_SET, an application can manipulate port sets much more
          efficiently than with individual MAP requests.</t>

        <t>Another example of an application using port sets is that of a busy
          back-to-back PCP server/client <xref
            target="I-D.cheshire-recursive-pcp"/>, handling many requests per
          second. It could benefit from PORT_SET by obtaining ports from
          upstream in big chunks. Then it would manage those chunks like port
          pools from which it would allocate to downstream clients. That could
          be more efficient than obtaining ports from upstream with individual
          MAP requests.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Firewall Control">

        <t>Port sets are often used in firewall rules. For example, defining a
          range for RTP <xref target="RFC3550"/> traffic is common practice. The
          MAP request can already be used for firewall control. The PORT_SET
          option brings the additional ability to manipulate firewall rules
          operating on port sets instead of single ports.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Discovering Stateless Port Set Mappings">

        <t>A MAP request can be used to discover a stateless mapping. Similarly,
          a MAP request with a PORT_SET request can be used to discover a
          stateless port set mapping. Hence, PORT_SET is applicable for port set
          mapping discovery in Stateless NAT44 <xref
            target="I-D.tsou-stateless-nat44"/>.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
          target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="The need for PORT_SET">

      <t>Multiple MAP requests can be used to manipulate a set of ports, having
        roughly the same effect as a single use of a MAP request with a PORT_SET
        option.  However, use of the PORT_SET option is more efficient when
        considering the following aspects:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Network Traffic:">A single request uses less network
            resources than multiple requests.</t>
          <t hangText="Latency:">Even though MAP requests can be sent in
            parallel, we can expect the total processing time to be longer for
            multiple requests than a single one.</t>
          <t hangText="Client-side simplicity:">The logic that is necessary for
            maintaining a set of ports using a single port set entity is much
            simpler than that required for maintaining individual ports,
            especially when considering failures, retransmissions, lifetime
            expiration, and re-allocations.</t>
          <t hangText="Server-side efficiency:">Some PCP-controlled devices can
            allocate port sets in a manner such that data passing through the
            device is processed much more efficiently than the equivalent using
            individual port allocations. For example, a CGN having a "bulk" port
            allocation scheme (see <xref target="RFC6888"/> section 5) often has
            this property.</t>
          <t hangText="Server-side scalability:">The number of mapping entries
            in PCP-controlled devices is often a limiting factor. Allocating
            port sets in a single request can result in a single mapping entry
            being used, therefore allowing greater scalability.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Therefore, while it is functionally possible to obtain the same results
        using plain MAP, the extension proposed in this document allows greater
        efficiency, scalability, and simplicity, while lowering latency and
        necessary network traffic. In a nutshell, PORT_SET is a necessary
        optimization.</t>

      <t>In addition, PORT_SET supports parity preservation. Some protocols
        (e.g. RTP <xref target="RFC3550"/>) assign meaning to a port number's
        parity. When mapping sets of ports for the purpose of using such kind of
        protocol, preserving parity can be necessary.</t>

            value sent in the request. That is to be contrasted to the Internal

          <t>NOTE: In its current form, PORT_SET does not support allocating

            depending on input from the working group.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The Internal Port Set is defined as being the range of Port Set Size
        ports starting from the First Internal Port. The External Port Set is
        respectively defined as being the range of Port Set Size ports starting
        from the Assigned External Port. The two ranges always have the same
        size (i.e., the Port Set Size returned by the server).</t>

      <section title="Client Behavior">

        <t>To retrieve a set of ports, the PCP client adds a PORT_SET option to
          its PCP MAP request. If port preservation is required, the PCP  Client
          MUST set the parity bit (to 1) to ask the server to preserve the port
          parity (i.e., the Assigned External Port and First Internal Port have
          the same parity). The PCP client MUST indicate a suggested Port Set
          Size.  A non-null value MUST be used. The client MUST set the First
          Internal Port field equal to the Internal Port field in the MAP
          opcode.</t>
        
        <t>The PCP Client MUST NOT include more than one PORT_SET option in a
          MAP request. If several port sets are needed, the PCP client MUST
          issue as many MAP requests each of them include a PORT_SET option.
          These individual MAP requests MUST include distinct Internal Port.</t>

        <t>If the PCP Client does not know the exact number of ports it
          requires, it may then set the Port Set Size to 0xffff, indicating that
          it is willing to accept as many ports as the server can offer.</t>
        
        <t>If the PORT_SET option is not supported by the server, the PCP client
          will receive a response with no PORT_SET option, which is the
          operation of a PCP server that does not support PORT_SET.  That
          response will map one port.  To map its other desired ports, the PCP
          client will then have to issue individual MAP requests with no
          PORT_SET option to achieve similar functionality.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Server Behavior">

        <t>In addition to regular MAP request processing, the following checks
          are made upon receipt of a PORT_SET option with non-zero Requested
          Lifetime:

          <list style="symbols">

            <t>If multiple PORT_SET options are present in a single MAP request,
              a MALFORMED_OPTION error is returned.</t>

            <t>If the Port Set Size is zero, a MALFORMED_OPTION error is
              returned.</t>

          </list>

        </t>

        <t>If the PREFER_FAILURE option is present and the server is unable to
          map all ports in the requested External Port Set or is unable to
          preserve parity (P = 1), the CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL error is
          returned.</t>

        <t>If the PREFER_FAILURE option is absent, the server MAY map fewer
          ports than the value of Port Set Size from the request. It MUST NOT
          map more ports than the client asked for. Internal ports outside the
          range of Port Set Size ports starting from the Internal Port MUST NOT
          be mapped by the server.</t>

        <t>If the requested port set cannot be fully satisfied, the PCP server
          SHOULD map as many ports as possible, and SHOULD map at least one port
          (which is same behavior as if PORT_SET is set to 1).</t>
       
        <t>If the server ends up mapping only a single port, for any reason, the
          PORT_SET option MUST NOT be present in the response.</t>

        <t>If the PREFER_FAILURE option is absent and port parity preservation
          is requested (P = 1), the server MAY preserve port parity. In that
          case, the External Port is set to a value having the same parity as
          the First Internal Port.</t>

        <t>If the mapping is successful, the MAP response's Assigned External
          Port is set to the first port in the External Port Set, and the
          PORT_SET option's Port Set Size is set to number of ports in the
          mapped port set. The First Internal Port field is set to the first
          port in the Internal Port Set.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Port Set Renewal and Deletion">

        <t>Port set mappings are renewed and deleted as a single entity. That
          is, the lifetime of all port mappings in the set is set to the
          Assigned Lifetime at once.</t>

        <t>A client attempting to refresh or delete a port set mapping MUST
          include the PORT_SET option in its request.</t>

        <section title="Overlap Conditions" anchor="overlap">

          <t>Port set map requests can overlap with existing single port or port
            set mappings. This can happen either by mistake or after a client
            becomes out of sync with server state.</t>

          <t>If a server receives a MAP request, with or without a PORT_SET
            option, that tries to map one or more internal ports or port sets
            belonging to already existing mappings, then the request is
            considered to be a refresh request applying those mappings. Each of
            the matching port or port set mappings is processed independently,
            as a if a separate refresh request had been received. The processing
            is as described in Section 15 of <xref target="RFC6887"/>, with the
            updated nonce check behavior described in Section 3 of <xref
              target="I-D.cheshire-pcp-unsupp-family"/>. The server sends a
            Mapping Update message for each of the mappings.

        <t>The PCP server is unable to fulfill the request fully: it is
          configured by local policy to only allocate 32 ports per user. Since
          the PREFER_FAILURE option is absent from the request, it decides to
          map UDP ports 37,056 to 37,087 on external address 192.0.2.3 to
          internal ports 50,000 to 50,031. After setting up the mapping in the
          NAT44 device it controls, it replies with the following PCP response:

            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>Upon receiving this response, the host decides that 32 ports is good
          enough for its purposes. It closes sockets bound to ports 50,032 to
          50,099, sets up a refresh timer, and starts using the port range it
          has just been assigned.</t>

      <section title="Stateless Mapping Discovery">

        <t>A host wants to discover a stateless NAT44 mapping pointing to it. To
          do so, it sends the following request over IPv4:

        <t>The PCP server sends the following response:

              <list style="hanging">

        <t>From this response, the host understands that a 2048-port stateless

          IP address 192.0.2.5.</t>

      <section title="Resolving Overlap">

        <t>This example relates to <xref target="overlap"/>.</t>

        <t>Suppose internal port 100 is mapped to external port 100 and port set
          101-199 is mapped to external port set 201-299.  The server receives a
          MAP request with Internal Port = 100, External Port = 0, and a
          PORT_SET option with Port Set Size = 100.  The request's Mapping Nonce
          is equal to those of the existing single port and port set mappings.
          This request is therefore treated as a two refresh requests, the first
          one applying to the single port mapping and the second one applying to
          the port set mapping. The server updates both mapping's lifetimes as
          usual then sends two Mapping Update messages: the first one contains
          Internal Port = 100, External Port = 100, and no PORT_SET option,
          while the second one contains Internal Port = 101, External Port =
          201, and a PORT_SET option with Port Set Size = 99.</t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Operational Considerations">

      <t>It is totally up to the PCP server to determine the port-set quota
        for each PCP client. In addition, when the PCP-controlled device
        supports multiple port-sets delegation for a given PCP client, the PCP
        client MAY re-initiate a PCP request to get another port set when it has
        exhausted all the ports within the port-set.</t>

      <t>If the PCP server is configured to allocate multiple port-set
        allocation for one subscriber, the same Assigned External IP Address
        SHOULD be assigned to one subscriber in multiple port-set requests.</t>

      <t>To optimize the number of mapping entries maintained by the PCP
        server, it is RECOMMENDED to configure the server to assign the
        maximum allowed port set in a single response. This policy SHOULD be
        configurable.</t>

      <t>The failover mechanism in MAP [section 14 in <xref
          target="RFC6887"></xref>] and <xref
          target="I-D.boucadair-pcp-failure"></xref> can also be applied to port
        sets.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>It is believed that no additional security considerations beyond those
        discussed in <xref target="RFC6887"></xref> apply to this extension.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">

      <t>IANA shall allocate a code in the range 1-63 for the new PCP option
        defined in <xref target="PORT_SET"/>.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

          <abstract><t>The Port Control Protocol (PCP) allows clients to request explicit dynamic inbound and outbound port mappings in their closest on-path NAT, firewall, or other middlebox.  However, in today's world, there may be more than one NAT on the path between a client and the public Internet.  This document describes how the closest on-path middlebox generates a corresponding upstream PCP request to the next closest on-path middlebox, to request an appropriate explicit dynamic port mapping in that middlebox too.  Applied recursively, this generates the necessary chain of port mappings in any number of middleboxes on the path between the client and the public Internet.</t></abstract>

          <abstract><t>This memo describes a protocol for decentralizing IPv4 NAT to the customer-premises equipment (CPE) such that no state information is kept on the central NAT device.  The CPE uses a restricted source port set that is encoded in its provisioned IPv4 WAN address.  The NAT device performs only strictly stateless address (not port) translation.</t></abstract>
