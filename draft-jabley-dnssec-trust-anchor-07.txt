           DNSSEC Trust Anchor Publication for the Root Zone
                  draft-jabley-dnssec-trust-anchor-07

Abstract

   The root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) has been
   cryptographically signed using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

   In order to obtain secure answers from the root zone of the DNS using
   DNSSEC, a client must configure a suitable trust anchor.  This
   document describes how such trust anchors are published.

Internet-Draft     Root Zone Trust Anchor Publication          June 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].
   Security extensions to the DNS (DNSSEC) are described in [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155] and [RFC5702].

   A discussion of operational practices relating to DNSSEC can be found
   in [RFC6781].

   In the DNSSEC protocol, resource record sets (RRSets) are signed
   cryptographically.  This means that a response to a query contains
   signatures that allow the integrity and authenticity of the RRSet to
   be verified.  Signatures are validated by following a chain of
   signatures to a key called a "trust anchor".  The reason for trusting
   such a key is outside the DNSSEC protocol, but having one or more
   trust anchors is required for the DNSSEC protocol to work.

   The publication of trust anchors for the root zone of the DNS is an
   IANA function performed by ICANN.  A detailed description of
   corresponding key management practices can be found in [DPS], which
   can be retrieved from the IANA Repository located at
   <https://www.iana.org/dnssec/>.

   This document describes the distribution of the DNSSEC trust anchors
   from IANA.  This document is concerned only with the distribution of
   trust anchors for the root zone, although the data formats and the
   publication and retrieval methods described here might can be adapted
   for other uses.

2.  Root Zone Trust Anchor Publication

   Trust anchors for the root zone are published in two formats, each of
   which is described in this document:

   o  as the hashes of the corresponding DNSKEY records, consistent with
      the defined presentation format of Delegation Signer (DS) resource
      records [RFC4034], contained within an XML document, as described
      in Section 2.1, and

   o  as Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in PKCS#10 format [RFC2986]
      for further processing by other entities such as Certification
      Authorities and validation of proof of possession of the
      corresponding private keys, as described in Section 2.2.

2.1.  XML

   Trust anchors are published in an XML document whose schema is
   described in Appendix A.  The document contains a complete set of
   trust anchors for the root zone, including anchors suitable for
   immediate use and also historical data.  Each trust anchor optionally
   includes one or more Certificate elements, with Uniform Resource
   Locators (URLs) for retrieving corresponding X.509 certificates.

   Examples of trust anchors packaged and signed for publication can be
   found in Appendix B.

2.2.  Certificate Signing Request (PKCS#10)

   To facilitate signing the trust anchor by a public key
   infrastructure, trust anchors are also published as Certificate
   Signing Requests (CSRs) in PKCS#10 format [RFC2986].

   Each CSR will have a Subject with following attributes:

   O: the string "ICANN".

   OU:  the string "IANA".

   CN:  the string "Root Zone KSK" followed by the time and date of key
      generation in the format specified in [RFC3339], e.g.  "Root Zone
      KSK 2010-06-16T21:19:24+00:00".

   resourceRecord:  the hash of the public key consistent with the
      presentation format of the Delegation Signer (DS) [RFC4034]
      resource record (see Appendix C for attribute definition).

3.  Root Zone Trust Anchor Retrieval

3.1.  HTTP

   Trust anchors are available for retrieval using HTTP [RFC2616].

   The URL for retrieving the CSR is
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.csr>, with "key-label"
   replaced by the key label of the corresponding KSK.

   The URL for retrieving a signed X.509 certificate is
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.crt>, with "key-label"
   again replaced as described above.

   The URL for retrieving the complete trust anchor set is
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml>.

   The URL for a detached S/MIME [RFC5751] signature for the current
   trust anchor set, in XML format, is
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.p7s>.

   The URL for a detached OpenPGP [RFC4880] signature for the current
   trust anchor set, in XML format, is
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.asc>.

3.2.  HTTP Over TLS

   Trust anchors are available for retrieval using HTTP over TLS
   [RFC2818].

   The URLs specified in Section 3.1 are also available using HTTPS.
   That is:

   The URL for retrieving the CSR is
   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.csr>, with "key-label"
   replaced by the key label of the corresponding KSK.

   The URL for retrieving a signed X.509 certificate is
   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.crt>, with "key-label"
   again replaced as described above.

   The URL for retrieving the complete trust anchor set is
   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml>.

   The URL for a detached S/MIME [RFC5751] signature for the current
   trust anchor set is
   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.p7s>.

   The URL for a detached OpenPGP [RFC4880] signature for the current
   trust anchor set is
   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.asc>.

   TLS sessions are authenticated with certificates presented from the
   server.  No client certificate verification is performed.  The
   certificate presented by the server is chosen such that it can be
   trusted using an X.509 trust anchor that is believed to be well-
   known, e.g. one that corresponds to a WebTrust-accredited Certificate
   Authority.  Other TLS authentication mechanisms may be considered in
   the future.

3.3.  Signature Verification

   The OpenPGP [RFC4880] keys used to sign trust anchor documents carry
   signatures from personal keys of staff who are able to personally
   attest to their validity.  Those staff members will continue to make
   their personal keys freely available for examination by third
   parties, e.g. by way of PGP key parties at operator and IETF
   meetings.  In this fashion a diverse set of paths through the PGP web
   of trust will be maintained to the trust anchor PGP keys.

   An OpenPGP keyring containing public keys pertinent to signature
   verification is published at
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/icann.pgp>.  The public keys on
   that keyring will also be distributed widely, e.g. to public PGP key
   servers.

   Certificates used to create S/MIME [RFC5751] signatures for the
   current trust anchor set, in XML format, are signed by a Certificate
   Authority (CA) administered by ICANN as the IANA functions operator
   and also optionally by well-known (e.g.  WebTrust-certified) CAs to
   facilitate signature validation with widely-available X.509 trust
   anchors.

4.  Implementation Considerations

   Note: This non-normative section gives suggestions for implementing
   root zone trust anchor retrieval.

   Root trust anchor retrieval by the HTTP or HTTP over TLS transports
   has several implementation considerations to ensure robustness,
   usability and secure operation.

4.1.  HTTP Over TLS Transport

   The HTTP over TLS transport [RFC2818] is suggested over the
   unencrypted HTTP transport [RFC2616] for implementations using the
   XML-format root trust anchors, since the latter transport does not
   provide authentication.  It is not suggested that implementations
   restrict certification path validation of the HTTP over TLS transport
   session to the current or historical certificate authorities used by
   the root trust anchor server, since doing so would reduce robustness
   of the implementation.  It is suggested that the implementation
   configure the HTTP over TLS transport library to validate the
   certification path against certificate revocation lists [RFC5280],
   and reject self-signed certificates and certification paths that do
   not terminate in a trusted certificate authority.

   Implementations can allow configuration of the URL used to retrieve
   the root trust anchor resources, but it is suggested that the default
   configuration use the URLs specified in Section 3.2.

4.2.  XML Validation

   Implementations may perform strict validation of the retrieved XML
   document against the XML schema; however, such an implementation
   would not be robust against future changes in the XML schema.  It is
   suggested that the implementation perform "loose" validation, where
   unknown attributes and elements are ignored.  This suggestion allows
   for future additions to the XML schema without affecting existing
   implementations.

4.3.  Trust Anchor Validation

   The implementation can ignore trust anchors for which the Algorithm
   or DigestType elements refer to an unknown, or unsupported algorithm.
   Additionally, trust anchors for which the Algorithm or DigestType
   elements refer to a deprecated algorithm can be ignored, provided
   that this suggestion does not cause all trust anchors to be ignored.
   Further, note that these suggestions may not apply where an
   implementation shares trust anchors between many DNS validating
   resolvers, since the set of supported algorithms may vary between

   resolvers, and could possibly be disjoint.

   The implementation can also ignore a trust anchor when the validUntil
   time, if present, is in the past.  If the implementation also
   supports automated updates of trust anchors [RFC5011], it can ignore
   trust anchors where the current time subtracted from the validFrom
   time, if present, is greater than the add-hold down time [RFC5011]
   for the trust point.

   The implementation can reject any trust anchor for a trust point
   other than the root zone.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Key Signing Key (KSK) management for the root zone is an IANA
   function.  This document describes an initial set of publication
   mechanisms for trust anchors related to that management.  In the
   future, additional publication schemes may also be made available, in
   which case they will be described in a new document that updates this
   one.

   Existing mechanisms will not be deprecated without very strong
   technical justification.

   This document contains information about an existing service, and has
   no IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes how DNSSEC trust anchors for the root zone of
   the DNS are published.  It is to be expected that many DNSSEC clients
   will only configure a single trust anchor to perform validation, and
   that the trust anchor they use will be that of the root zone.  As a
   consequence, reliable publication of trust anchors is important.

   This document aims to specify carefully the means by which such trust
   anchors are published, as an aid to the formats and retrieval methods
   described here being integrated usefully into user environments.

Appendix D.  Historical Note

   The first KSK for use in the root zone of the DNS was generated at a
   key ceremony at an ICANN Key Management Facility (KMF) in Culpeper,
   Virginia, USA on 2010-06-16.  This key entered production during a
   second key ceremony held at an ICANN KMF in El Segundo, California,
   USA on 2010-07-12.  The resulting trust anchor was first published on
   2010-07-15.
