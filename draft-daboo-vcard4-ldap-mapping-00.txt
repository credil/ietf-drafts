1.  Introduction

   This specification describes a mapping of standard VCard 4 properties
   defined in vCard Format Specification [RFC6350] to standard LDAP
   objectclasses and attributes.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Mappings

3.1.  Full Name

   VCard Property: The FN property that specifies the full name of the
   entity as defined in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC6350].

   LDAP Attribute Mapping: The cn attribute as defined in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC4519].

3.2.  Kind

   VCard Property: Property KIND that specifies the kind of entity

4.  Security Considerations

   As this document only defines mapping between VCard 4 properties and
   parameters to LDAP objectclasses and attributes and does not refer to
   any actual storage mechanism itself,no special security
   considerations are required as part of this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any new IANA registrations.

6.  Acknowledgments

   This specification is a result of discussions that took place within
   the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium's Resource Technical
   Committee.  The authors thank the participants of that group.
