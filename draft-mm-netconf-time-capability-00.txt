Abstract

   This document defines a capability-based extension to the Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) that allows time-triggered
   configuration and management operations. This extension allows
   NETCONF clients to invoke configuration updates according to
   scheduled times, and allows NETCONF servers to attach timestamps to
   the data they send to NETCONF clients.

1. Introduction

   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) defined in [RFC6241]
   provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the
   configuration of network devices. NETCONF allows clients to configure
   and monitor NETCONF servers using remote procedure calls (RPC).

   NETCONF, as defined in [RFC6241], is asynchronous; when a client
   invokes an RPC, it has no control over the time at which the RPC is
   executed, nor does it have any feedback from the server about the
   execution time.

Internet-Draft       Time Capability in NETCONF              July 2013


   Time-based configuration ([HotSDN], [TimeTR]) can be a useful tool
   that enables an entire class of coordinated and scheduled
   configuration procedures. Time-triggered configuration allows
   coordinated network updates in multiple devices; a client can invoke
   a coordinated configuration change by sending RPCs to multiple
   servers with the same scheduled execution time. A client can also
   invoke a time-based sequence of updates by sending n RPCs with n
   different update times, T1, T2, ..., Tn, determining the order in
   which the RPCs are executed.

   This memo defines the time capability in NETCONF. This extension
   allows clients to determine the scheduled execution time of RPCs they
   send. It also allows a server that receives an RPC to report its
   actual execution time to the client.

   o Server [RFC6142]: Executes protocol operations invoked by a
      client.  In addition, a server can send notifications to a client.

3. Using Time in NETCONF

3.1. The Time Capability in a Nutshell

   The :time capability provides two main functions:

   o Scheduling:
      When a client sends an RPC to a server, the RPC message MAY
      include a scheduled time, Ts (see Figure 1). The server then
      executes the RPC at the scheduled time Ts, and once completed the
      server can respond with an RPC reply message.

   o Reporting:
      When a client sends an RPC to a server, the RPC message MAY
      include a get-time element (see Figure 2), requesting the server
      to return the execution time of the RPC. In this case, after the
      server performs the RPC it responds with an RPC reply that
      includes the execution time, Te.

              Figure 2 Reporting the Execution Time of an RPC

   The two scenarios discussed above imply that a third scenario can
   also be supported (Figure 3), where the client invokes an RPC that
   includes a scheduled time, Ts, as well as the get-time element. This
   allows the client to receive feedback about the actual execution
   time, Te. Ideally, Ts=Te. However, the server may execute the RPC at
   a slightly different time than Ts, for example if the server is tied
   up with other tasks at Ts.

3.2. Synchronization Aspects

   The time capability defined in this document requires clients and
   servers to maintain clocks. It is assumed that clocks are
   synchronized by a method that is outside the scope of this document.

   This document does not define any requirements pertaining to the
   degree of accuracy of performing scheduled RPCs. Note that two
   factors affect how accurately the server can perform a scheduled RPC;
   one factor is the accuracy of the clock synchronization method used


Mizrahi, Moses         Expires January 8, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Time Capability in NETCONF              July 2013


   to synchronize the clients and servers, and the second factor is the
   server's ability to execute real-time configuration changes, which
   greatly depends on how it is implemented. Typical networking devices
   are implemented by a combination of hardware and software. While the
   execution time of a hardware module can typically be predicted with a
   high level of accuracy, the execution time of a software module may
   be variable and hard to predict. A configuration update would
   typically require the server's software to be involved, thus
   affecting how accurately the RPC can be scheduled.

   Since servers do not perform configuration changes instantaneously,
   the processing time of an RPC should not be overlooked. The scheduled
   time and execution time always refer to the completion time of the
   RPC.

3.3. Time Format

   The scheduled time and execution time fields in RPC messages use a
   common time format field.

   The time format defined in this document is similar to the one
   defined in [IEEE1588].

   Time is represented as follows:

     grouping time-parameters {
       description
       "Contains the parameters of the time element.";
       leaf seconds {
         description
         "The seconds portion of the time element.";
         type uint64;
       }
       leaf nanoseconds {
         description
         "The nanoseconds portion of the time element.";
         type uint32;
       }
     }


   The time-parameters grouping consists of two sub-fields; a seconds
   field, representing the integer portion of time in seconds, and a
   nanoseconds field, representing the fractional portion of time in
   nanoseconds.

Internet-Draft       Time Capability in NETCONF              July 2013


   Time is measured according to the International Atomic Time (TAI)
   timescale. The epoch is defined as 1 January 1970 00:00:00 TAI.

4. Time Capability

   The structure of this section is as defined in Appendix D of
   [RFC6241].

4.1. Overview

   A server that supports the time capability can perform time-triggered
   operations as defined in this document.

   A server implementing the :time capability:

   o MUST support the ability to receive <rpc> messages that include a
      time element, and perform a time-triggered operation accordingly.

   o MUST support the ability to include a time element in the <rpc-
      reply> messages that it transmits.

4.2. Dependencies

   None.

4.3. Capability Identifier

   The :time capability is identified by the following capability string
   (to be assigned by IANA - see Section 7.):

   urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:time:1.0

4.4. New Operations

   None.

4.5. Modifications to Existing Operations

   Three new elements are added to all existing operations:

   o <scheduled-time>
      This element is added to the input of each operation, indicating
      the time at which the server is scheduled to complete the
      operation. Every <rpc> message MAY include the <scheduled-time>
      element. A server that supports the :time capability and receives
      an <rpc> message with a <scheduled-time> element MUST perform the
      operation at the scheduled time.

Internet-Draft       Time Capability in NETCONF              July 2013


   o <get-time>
      This element is added to the input of each operation. An <rpc>
      message MAY include a <get-time> element, indicating that the
      server MUST include an <execution-time> in its corresponding <rpc-
      reply>.

   o <execution-time>
      This element is added to the output of each operation, indicating
      the time at which the server completed the operation. An <rpc-
      reply> MAY include the <execution-time> element. A server that
      supports the :time capability and receives an operation with the
      <get-time> element MUST include the execution time in its
      response.

4.6. Interactions with Other Capabilities

Confirmed Commit Capability

   The confirmed commit capability is defined in Section 8.4 of
   [RFC6241]. According to [RFC6241], a confirmed <commit> operation
   MUST be reverted if a confirming commit is not issued within the
   timeout period (which by default is 600 seconds).

   When the time capability is supported, and a confirmed <commit>
   operation is used with the <scheduled-time> element, the confirmation
   timeout MUST be counted from the scheduled time, i.e., the client
   begins the timeout measurement starting at the scheduled time.

5. Examples

5.1. <scheduled-time> Example

   The following example extends the example presented in Section 7.2 of
   [RFC6241] by adding the time capability. In this example, the
   <scheduled-time> element is used to specify the scheduled execution
   time of the configuration update (as shown in Figure 1).

5.2. <get-time> Example

   The following example is similar to the one presented in Section 5.1.
   , except that in this example the client includes a <get-time>
   element in its RPC, and the server consequently responds with an
   <execution-time> element (as shown in Figure 2).

   <rpc message-id="101"
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">

6. Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the NETCONF protocol in general are
   discussed in [RFC6241].

   The usage of the time capability defined in this document can assist
   an attacker in gathering information about the system, such as the
   exact time of future configuration changes. Moreover, the time
   elements can potentially allow an attacker to learn information about
   the system's performance. Furthermore, an attacker that sends
   malicious RPC messages can use the time capability to amplify her
   attack; for example, by sending multiple RPC messages with the same
   scheduled time. It is important to note that the security measures
   described in [RFC6241] can prevent these vulnerabilities.

   The time capability relies on an underlying time synchronization
   protocol. Thus, an attack against the time protocol can potentially
   compromise NETCONF when using the time capability. A detailed
   discussion about the threats against time protocols and how to
   mitigate them is presented in [TimeSec].

7. IANA Considerations

   This document proposes to register the following capability
   identifier URN in the 'Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)
   Capability URNs' registry:

        urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:time:1.0
