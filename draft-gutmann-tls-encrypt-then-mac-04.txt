Abstract

   This document describes a means of negotiating the use of the
   encrypt-then-MAC security mechanism in place of TLS'/DTLS' existing
   MAC-then-encrypt one, which has been the subject of a number of
   security vulnerabilities over a period of many years.

1.  Introduction

   [2] and [4] use a MAC-then-encrypt construction that was regarded as
   secure at the time the original SSL protocol was specified in the
   mid-1990s, but that is no longer regarded as secure [5] [6].  This
   construction, as used in TLS and later DTLS, has been the subject of
   numerous security vulnerabilities and attacks stretching over a
   period of many years.  This document specifies a means of switching
   to the more secure encrypt-then-MAC construction as part of the TLS/
   DTLS handshake, replacing the current MAC-then-encrypt construction.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

2.  Negotiating Encrypt-then-MAC

   The use of encrypt-then-MAC is negotiated via TLS/DTLS extensions as
   defined in [2].  On connecting, the client includes the
   encrypt_then_MAC extension in its client_hello if it wishes to use
   encrypt-then-MAC rather than the default MAC-then-encrypt.  If the
   server is capable of meeting this requirement, it responds with an
   encrypt_then_MAC in its server_hello.  The "extension_type" value for
   this extension is [TBD] and the "extension_data" field of this
   extension SHALL be empty.

2.1.  Rationale

   The use of TLS/DTLS extensions to negotiate an overall switch is
   preferable to defining new ciphersuites because the latter would

   result in a Cartesian explosion of suites, potentially requiring
   duplicating every single existing suite with a new one that uses
   encrypt-then-MAC.  In contrast the approach presented here requires
   just a single new extension type with a corresponding minimal-length
   extension sent by client and server.

   Another possibility for introducing encrypt-then-MAC would be to make
   it part of TLS 1.3, however this would require the implementation and
   deployment of all of TLS 1.2 just to support a trivial code change in
   the order of encryption and MAC'ing.  In contrast deploying encrypt-
   then-MAC via the TLS/DTLS extension mechanism required changing less
   than a dozen lines of code in one implementation (not including the
   handling for the new extension type, which was a further 50 or so
   lines of code).

   The use of extensions precludes use with SSL 3.0, but then it's
   likely that anything still using this nearly two decades-old protocol
   will be vulnerable to any number of other attacks anyway, so there
   seems little point in bending over backwards to accomodate SSL 3.0.

3.  Applying Encrypt-then-MAC

   Once the use of encrypt-then-MAC has been negotiated, processing of
   TLS/DTLS packets switches from the standard:

   encrypt( data || MAC || pad )


   to the new:

   encrypt( data || pad ) || MAC


   with the MAC covering the entire packet up to the start of the MAC
   value.  In [2] notation the MAC calculation is:

   MAC(MAC_write_key, seq_num +
       TLSCipherText.type +
       TLSCipherText.version +
       TLSCipherText.length +
       ENC(content + padding + padding_length));


   for TLS 1.0 without the explicit IV and:

   MAC(MAC_write_key, seq_num +
       TLSCipherText.type +
       TLSCipherText.version +

Internet-Draft          Encrypt-then-MAC-for-TLS            October 2013


       TLSCipherText.length +
       IV +
       ENC(content + padding + padding_length));


   for TLS 1.1 and greater with explicit IV.  The final MAC value is
   then appended to the encrypted data and padding.  This calculation is
   identical to the existing one with the exception that the MAC
   calculation is run over the payload ciphertext (the TLSCipherText
   PDU) rather than the plaintext (the TLSCompressed PDU).

   In [2] notation the overall packet is then:

   struct {
          ContentType type;
          ProtocolVersion version;
          uint16 length;
          GenericStream/BlockCipher fragment;
          opaque MAC;
          } TLSCiphertext;


   This is identical to the existing TLS layout with the only difference
   being that the MAC value is moved outside the encrypted data.  The
   change for DTLS follows similarly, the only difference being that in
   place of the 64-bit implicit sequence number DTLS contains the two
   32-bit fields 'epoch' and 'sequence_number' between the version and
   length.

   Note from the GenericStreamCipher/GenericBlockCipher annotation that
   this only applies to standard stream and block ciphers that have
   distinct encrypt and MAC operations.  It does not apply to
   GenericAEADCiphers that already include integrity protection with the
   cipher.  If a server receives an encrypt-then-MAC request extension
   from a client and then selects an AEAD cipher suite, it MUST NOT send
   an encrypt-then-MAC response extension back to the client.

   Decryption reverses this processing.  The MAC SHALL be evaluated
   before any further processing such as decryption is performed, and if
   the MAC verification fails then processing SHALL terminate
   immediately.  This eliminates any timing channels that may be
   available through the use of manipulated packet data.

   Some implementations may prefer to use a truncated MAC rather than a
   full-length one.  In this case they MAY negotiate the use of a
   truncated MAC through the TLS truncated_hmac extension as defined in
   [3].

        [Implementation note: There is a test server available for interop
         testing at https://eid.vx4.net:443/. This uses the "extension_type"
         value 0x10, which was the first unassigned TLS extension value at the
         time the original specification was written, since this draft has
         been stalled by the TLS WG chairs for a considerable amount of time
         this value has now been assigned to another RFC but is currently
         still used for interop-testing purposes.  The server has been tested
         successfully with several different implementations].


3.1.  Rehandshake Issues

   The status of encrypt-then-MAC vs. MAC-then-encrypt can potentially
   change during a rehandshake.  Implementations SHOULD retain the
   current session state for the renegotiated session (in other words if
   the mechanism for the current session is X then the renegotiated
   session should also use X).  If implementations wish to be more
   flexible then the following rules apply:

   +---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
   |   Current Session   | Renegotiated Session |    Action to take    |
   +---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
   |   MAC-then-encrypt  |   MAC-then-encrypt   |      No change       |
   |                     |                      |                      |
   |   MAC-then-encrypt  |   Encrypt-then-MAC   | Upgrade to Encrypt-  |
   |                     |                      |       then-MAC       |
   |                     |                      |                      |
   |   Encrypt-then-MAC  |   MAC-then-encrypt   |        Error         |
   |                     |                      |                      |
   |   Encrypt-then-MAC  |   Encrypt-then-MAC   |      No change       |
   +---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

               Table 1: Encrypt-then-MAC with Renegotiation

   Note that a client or server that doesn't wish to implement the
   mechanism-change-during-rehandshake ability can (as a client) not
   request a mechanism change and (as a server) deny the mechanism
   change.

   If an upgrade from MAC-then-encrypt to Encrypt-then-MAC is negotiated
   as per the second line in the table above then the change will take
   place in the first message that follows the Change Cipher Spec (CCS).
   In other words all messages up to and including the CCS will use MAC-
   then-encrypt, and then the message that follows will continue with
   Encrypt-then-MAC.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an improved security mechanism encrypt-then-MAC
   to replace the current MAC-then-encrypt one.  This is regarded as
   more secure than the current mechanism [5] [6], and should mitigate
   or eliminate a number of attacks on the current mechanism, provided
   that the instructions on MAC processing given in Section 3 are
   applied.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new extension for TLS/DTLS.
