Abstract

   The network in datacenter is required to provide a tenant network,
   which should be virtualized, and be able to provide L2 switching or
   L3 routing capability.  A combined L2&L3 solution could provide great
   scalability for both Layer2 and Layer3 switching.  In this document,
   we propose to apply centralized server to be the control plane of the
   combined L2&L3 solution, to provide better scalability for the
   control plane.  The combined L2&L3 solution in this draft is named
   Virtualized Integrated Routing&Bridging (shorted as VIRB).

1.  Introduction

   The network in datacenter is required to provide a tenant network,
   which should be virtualized, and be able to provide L2 switching or
   L3 routing capability.

   Within one tenant, there is case the customer requires on bridge
   domain, and there is also case that the customer requires multiple
   bridge domains separated by customer VLAN.

   Then the virtualized network or tenant network provided by NVO3
   should have at least following capability:

   1.  Provide traffic segregation between different virtualized
   network.

   2.  Provide multiple bridge domains within one tenant by customer
   VLAN.

   3.  Provide Layer2 traffic segregation between different bridge
   domain within one tenant.

   4.  Provide Layer3 routing between different bridge domain within one
   tenant.

   5.  Provide seamless interconnection between the virtualized network
   and already defined L2VPN, e.g, BGP/LDP-based VPLS, E-VPN.

   6.  Provide seamless interconnection between the virtualized network
   and already defined L3VPN, e.g, BGP MPLS VPN.

   [I-D.sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-ipvpn-interop] proposes an E-VPN based
   combined L2&L3 solution, named IRB, to address the shortcomings of
   L2-only as well as L3-only solutions, and provide optimum forwarding
   for both inter and intra subnet switching.

   In this document, we propose to apply centralized server to be the
   control plane of the combined L2&L3 solution.  The combined L2&L3
   solution in this draft is named Virtualized Integrated Routing&
   Bridging (shorted as VIRB).

   VIRB: Virtualized Integrated Routing and Bridging


2.  VIRB model on NVE

   VIRB will provide both virtualized Routing and Bridging in one
   virtual instance, and the dataplane behavior is similar with a Layer3
   switch box or IRB(Integrated Routing and Bridging).  The functional
   model of VIRB will be like below:

                                 Figure 1

   One tenant will include a Layer2 instance and Layer3 instance.  The
   Layer2 instance will include multiple bridge domain.  The virtual
   routing module is responsible for IP forwarding for VIRB instance,



Jin, et al.               Expires June 16, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-nvo3-virb-centralized-00      December 2012


   while virtual bridge module is responsible for MAC based forwarding
   within one VLAN.  One VIRB instance could contain only one virtual
   routing module and multiple virtual bridges, each of which is
   separated by VLAN.  Both the virtual routing and virtual bridge has
   interface to the overlay module.  Each virtual bridge module has a
   virtual interface to virtual routing module, and every IP subnet is
   associated with this virtual interface.  Within every tenant, the
   virtual bridge and corresponding bridge domain is uniquely identified
   by VLAN ID, while different tenants could have duplicated VLAN ID to
   identify the bridge domain.

   When a frame received by an ingress NVE from tenant system, it needs
   to be parsed in order to identify which VIRB instance it belongs to.
   The parsing function can examine various fields in the data frame
   (e.g., Service Delimiting VLAN-ID) and/or associated interface/port
   the frame came from.  Once the VIRB instance is identified, the
   customer VLAN-ID+MAC should be used to do Layer2 forwarding.  If the
   customer VLAN-ID does not exist, a default VLAN-ID configured locally
   could be used instead.

   The frame with destination MAC address owned by virtual routing
   instance should be subjected to do Layer 3 forwarding by virtual
   routing module.


3.  VIRB Dataplane Format

   The general format of the VIRB protocol layering model is same as the
   format defined for L2VNI and L3VNI in
   [I-D.bl-nvo3-dataplane-requirements].  One VIRB instances include a
   Layer2 instance and a Layer3 instance.  In order to be fully
   compatible with existing MPLS Layer3/2 VPN, this document suggests
   using MPLS label as both the L2/L3 encapsulation indicator and VNID.
   Different bridge domains within one tenant are identified by the VLAN
   ID, while the Layer2 and Layer3 instance is identified by the MPLS
   label.  Other format of VNID for VIRB will be studied in furture
   version


4.  Control Plane with Centralized Server

   Due to the requirement described in
   [I-D.kreeger-nvo3-overlay-cp]section 4, it is high cost for every NVE
   to accommodate the whole forwarding table, including MAC forwarding
   table for virtual bridge module and IP forwarding table for virtual
   routing module.

   We propose to use centralized server to control the MAC forwarding



Jin, et al.               Expires June 16, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-nvo3-virb-centralized-00      December 2012


   table and IP forwarding table.  The framework would be shown in
   following figure.

   This document only specifies the interaction specification between
   NVE and centralized server.  How the centralized server is organized
   or implemented is out of the scope of this draft.

   Every NVE will learn the local VAP, VM/Host MAC address, VLAN and IP
   address, by e.g, snooping ARP packets, or by Server-NVE protocol, or
   by getting information from virtualization software if NVE resides on
   hypervisor.  And then NVE SHOULD send the learned MAC, VLAN, IP
   address and VNI to the centralized server.  The centralized server
   SHOULD generate the Layer2 MAC information, and Layer3 IP
   information.  And these information would be advertised to other NVE
   and centralized servers.  The signaling session between NVE and
   centralized server could be OpenFlow or XMPP which has already been
   supported on Linux package, and would specified in future version of
   this draft.

4.1.  Layer2 information distribution

   Each bridge domain within one tenant is identified by the VLAN unique
   within tenant, and the Layer2 MAC forwarding information should
   include at least the following:

   1.  VM/Host MAC address

   2.  VLAN ID

   3.  MPLS label for Layer2

   4.  VIRB ID for control plane

   5.  NVE Address

   The Layer2 MAC information SHOULD be distributed by centralized
   server to other NVE or other centralized server.  The NVE receiving
   the Layer2 MAC information should import this information only to the
   bridge domain with same VLAN ID and VIRB ID.  The MAC forwarding
   table generated by the centralized server would be following:

   1.  Forwarding entry for Packet to local VAP: <Incoming:
   Destination_MAC+VLAN, outgoing: local VAP on NVE>

   2.  Forwarding entry for Packet to remote NVE: <Incoming:
   Destination_MAC+VLAN, outgoing: overlay tunnel identified by remote
   NVE address>

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-nvo3-virb-centralized-00      December 2012


4.2.  Layer3 information distribution

   Before generating the Layer3 IP information, the IP address SHOULD be
   summarized within one VLAN one tenant if possible for each NVE.  The
   Layer3 IP information should include at least the following:

   1.  IP Prefix (summarized from VM/Host IP address)

   2.  MPLS label for Layer 3

   3.  VIRB ID for control plane

   4.  NVE Address

   5.  Node Priority

   The node priority is used for gateway selection for unicast traffic
   and designated virtual routing instance selection for multicast
   traffic, see details in section 4.3 and 4.4.  Note that the IP prefix
   on virtual interface between virtual routing and bridge instance
   should not be advertised.

   The Layer3 IP information SHOULD be distributed by centralized server
   to other NVE or other centralized server.  The NVE receiving the
   Layer3 IP information should import this information only to the
   virtual routing instance with same VIRB ID.  The IP routing table
   generated by the centralized server would be following:

   1.  Forwarding entry for Packet to bridge domain: <Incoming:
   destination_IP prefix, outgoing: local virtual bridge interface>

   2.  Forwarding entry for Packet to remote NVE: <Incoming:
   destination_IP prefix, outgoing: overlay tunnel identified by remote
   NVE address>

   Note that, the VIRB ID for control plane in Layer2 and Layer3
   information MUST be the same, and this value is only used for control
   plane to identify each VIRB instance.

4.3.  Gateway selection for L2VNI

   In the virtual network with both VIRB instance and L2-only Virtual
   Network Instance (short for L2VNI), the NVE in L2VNI should find the
   best virtual routing instance as a gateway.  The centralized server
   has all the IP address information of the VM/Host attached to VIRB or
   L2VNI, then the gateway selection for L2VNI should consider the
   following factors:




Jin, et al.               Expires June 16, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-nvo3-virb-centralized-00      December 2012


   1.  IP address summarization: virtual routing instance which has the
   maximum capability to summarize the IP address from L2VNI should be
   selected as the gateway.

   2.  Processing load: the virtual routing instance on the NVE which
   has lower processing load should be selected as the gateway.
   Different bridge domain could have different gateway, so as to
   achieve load balance.

   3.  Path cost: the virtual routing instance nearest to the L2VNI
   should be selected as the gateway.

   4.  Priority: the virtual routing instance with high priority should
   be selected as the gateway.

   The specific gateway selection mechanism is a local policy on the
   centralized server, and is not specified in this draft.

4.4.  Designated Virtual Routing Instance Selection for Multicast

   The multicast traffic within one bridge domain should be distributed
   through the Layer2 overlay.  Then there should be a designated
   virtual routing instance to be selected from the routing instances
   within one bridge domain.  The selection of designated virtual
   routing instance should be performed by centralized server in
   following steps:

   1.  Discover the virtual routing instance within the same bridge
   domain, by checking if these virtual routing instances have been
   attached with same VLAN.

   2.  Discover the virtual routing instance where its attached local
   bridge domain is requested to join the same multicast group.

   3.  Select the designated virtual routing instance which is nearest
   to multicast source.  Note that the assumption here is the
   centralized server has the cost information among the NVEs.

   4.  Select the designated virtual routing instance by the priority
   and NVE address.

   The centralized server could apply pull or push or combined pull and
   push to send the forwarding table to each NVE.  This depends on the
   NVE forwarding memory capability.

5.  Interoperating with MPLS Layer3/2 VPN

   The seamless interoperability with MPLS Layer3/2 VPN has been
   described in [I-D.sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-ipvpn-interop] section 2.  In
   this section, we will only describe the specific behavior of
   centralized server for the seamless interoperability.

   The signaling session between centralized server and MPLS Layer3/2
   VPN PE MUST be MP-BGP session, and the centralized server SHOULD
   support the signaling function of MPLS Layer3/2 VPN.

   The centralized server SHOULD learn the L3VPN IP forwarding
   information through MP-BGP session.  The routing information received
   from L3VPN PE will also be advertised to each VIRB instance, and then
   corresponding IP routing entry will be generated on virtual routing
   module.

   The centralized server SHOULD learn the Layer2 MAC forwarding
   information from L2VPN through MP-BGP session.  And the Layer2 MAC
   forwarding information received should be imported to a bridge
   domain, and which is assigned by a locally designated VLAN.  The MAC
   information from L2VPN PE will be also advertised to each VIRB
   instance, and imported to the corresponding bridge domain.

   Will be added in future.

   Will be added in future.
