        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                This document describes a specification for querying registration data using a RESTful web
                service and uniform query patterns.  The service is implemented using the Hypertext Transfer
                Protocol (HTTP) <xref target="RFC2616"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
                The protocol described in this specification is intended to address deficiencies with the
                WHOIS protocol <xref target="RFC3912"/> that have been identified over time, including:</t>
	          
	    <t><list style="symbols">
	        <t>Lack of standardized command structures,</t>
	        <t>lack of standardized output and error structures,</t>
	        <t>lack of support for internationalization and localization, and</t>
	        <t>lack of support for user identification, authentication, and access control.</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                The patterns described in this document purposefully do not encompass all of the methods employed
                in the WHOIS and RESTful web services of all of the RIRs and DNRs. The intent of the patterns
                described here are to enable queries of:
           </t>
	    <t><list style="symbols">
	        <t>networks by IP address,</t>
	        <t>autonomous system numbers by number,</t>
	        <t>reverse DNS meta-data by domain,</t>
	        <t>name servers by name,</t>
	        <t>registrars by name, and</t>
	        <t>entities (such as contacts) by identifier.</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                It is envisioned that each registry will continue to maintain NICNAME/WHOIS and/or RESTful web services
                specific to their needs and those of their constituencies, and the information retrieved through the
                patterns described here may reference such services.
            </t>
            <t>
                Likewise, future IETF standards may add additional patterns for additional query types. A simple pattern
                namespacing scheme is described in <xref target="extensibility"/> to accomodate custom extensions that will not
                interfere with the patterns defined in this document or patterns defined in future IETF standards.
            </t>
            <t>
                WHOIS services, in general, are read-only services. Therefore <xref target="RFC3986">URL</xref> patterns
                specified in this document are only applicable to the <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref> GET and HEAD methods.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document does not describe the results or entities returned from issuing
                the described URLs with an HTTP GET. JSON <xref target="RFC4627"/> result formatting and processing is described in
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
                Additionally, resource management, provisioning and update functions are out of
                scope for this document. Registries have various and divergent methods covering these
                functions, and it is unlikely a uniform approach for these functions will ever
                be possible.
            </t>
            <t>
                HTTP contains mechanisms for servers to authenticate clients and for clients to authenticate servers (from which authorization schemes may be built) so such mechanisms are not described in this document. Policy, provisioning, and processing of authentication and authorization are out-of-scope for this document as deployments will have to make choices based on local criteria. Specified authentication mechanisms MUST use HTTP.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Path Segment Specification">
            <t>
                The uniform patterns start with a base <xref target="RFC3986">URL</xref> specified by each registry or any other
                service provider offering this service. The base URL is followed by a resource-type-specific path segment.
                The base URL may contain its own path segments (e.g. http://example.com/... or http://example.com/rdap/... ).
                The characters used to form a path segment are limited to those that can be used to form a URI as specified in RFC 3986 <xref target="RFC3986"/>.
            </t>
            
            <section title="Lookup Path Segment Specification">
            <t>
                The resource type path segments for exact match lookup are:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>'ip': Used to identify IP networks and associated data referenced using either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.</t>
                    <t>'autnum': Used to identify autonomous system registrations and associated data referenced using an AS Plain autonomous system number.</t>
                    <t>'domain': Used to identify reverse DNS (RIR) or domain name (DNR) information and associated data referenced using a fully-qualified domain name.</t>
                    <t>'nameserver': Used to identify a name server information query using a host name.</t>
                    <t>'entity': Used to identify an entity information query using a string identifier.</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <section title="IP Network Path Segment Specification" anchor="ip-network-paths">
                <t>Syntax: ip/&lt;IP address&gt; or ip/&lt;CIDR prefix&gt;/&lt;CIDR length&gt;</t>
                <t>
                    Queries for information about IP networks are of the form /ip/XXX/... or /ip/XXX/YY/...
                    where the path segment following 'ip' is either an <xref target="RFC1166">IPv4</xref> or 
                    <xref target="RFC5952">IPv6</xref> address (i.e. XXX) or an IPv4 or IPv6 
                    <xref target="RFC4632">CIDR</xref> notation address block (i.e. XXX/YY). 
                    Semantically, the simpler form using the address can be thought of as a CIDR block with a bitmask length of 32 for IPv4
                    and a bitmask length of 128 for IPv6. A given specific address or CIDR may fall within multiple
                    IP networks in a hierarchy of networks, therefore this query targets the "most-specific"
                    or smallest IP network which completely encompasses it in a hierarchy of IP networks.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The IPv4 and IPv6 address formats supported in this query are described in section 3.2.2 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>, as
                    IPv4address and IPv6address ABNF definitions. Any valid IPv6 text address format <xref target="RFC4291"/> can be used,
                    compressed or not compressed. The restricted rules to write a text representation of an IPv6 address <xref target="RFC5952"/>
                    are not mandatory. However, the zone id <xref target="RFC4007"/> is not appropriate in this context and therefore prohibited.
                </t>

            <section title="Autonomous System Path Segment Specification">
                <t>Syntax: autnum/&lt;autonomous system number&gt;</t>
                <t>
                    Queries for information regarding autonomous system number registrations are of the form
                    /autnum/XXX/... where XXX is an AS Plain <xref target="RFC5396">autonomous system number</xref>. In some registries,
                    registration of autonomous system numbers is done on an individual number basis, while
                    other registries may register blocks of autonomous system numbers. The semantics of this
                    query are such that if a number falls within a range of registered blocks, the target of
                    the query is the block registration, and that individual number registrations are considered
                    a block of numbers with a size of 1.
                </t>
                <t>For example, to find information on autonomous system number 65551, the following path would be used:</t>
                <t>

                <t>
                  /autnum/65538
                </t>

      mark character ('?', ASCII value 0x003F), the JSON object value associated with the
      object being searched for, the equal sign character ('=', ASCII value 0x003D), and

    <section title="Search Processing" anchor="search_proc">
      <t>Partial string searching uses the asterisk ('*', ASCII value 0x002A) character to match
        zero or more trailing characters. Additional pattern matching processing is beyond the scope
        of this specification.</t>

      <t>If a server receives a search request but cannot process the request because it does not
        support a particular style of partial match searching, it SHOULD return an HTTP 422 <xref target="RFC4918"/> error.
        When returning a 422 error, the server MAY also return an error response body as specified
        in Section 7 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response"/> if the requested media type
        is one that is specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http"/>.</t>

      <t>
        Because Unicode characters may be combined with another Unicode character or characters,
        partial matching is not feasible across combinations of Unicode characters.
        Servers SHOULD NOT partially match combinations of Unicode characters where a Unicode
        character may be legally combined with another Unicode character or characters. 
        Clients should avoid submitting a partial match search of Unicode characters where a Unicode
        character may be legally combined with another Unicode character or characters.
        Partial match searches with incomplete combinations of characters where a character
        must be combined with another character or characters are invalid. Partial match
        searches with characters that may be combined with another character or characters
        are to be considered non-combined characters (that is, if character x may be combined
        with character y but character y is not submitted in the search string then
        character x is a complete character and no combinations of character x are to be
        searched).
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Because Unicode characters may be combined with another Unicode character or characters,
        partial matching requires that a server maintain a list of valid character combinations
        to be considered a match.
        When comparing DNS U-labels, servers SHOULD use the code points specified in <xref target="RFC5892"></xref>
        to determine partial matches. When comparing entity names, servers SHOULD use the normalization
        rules and code points specified by <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-nickname"></xref> to determine
        partial matches.

        <section title="Extensibility" anchor="extensibility">
            <t>This document describes path segment specifications for a limited number of objects
                commonly registered in both RIRs and DNRs. It does not attempt to describe path
                segments for all of the objects registered in all registries. Custom path segments
                can be created for objects not specified here using the process described in Section
                6 of "HTTP usage in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)" <xref
                    target="I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http"/>.</t>

            <t>Custom path segments can be created by prefixing the segment with a unique identifier
                followed by an underscore character (0x5F). For example, a custom entity path
                segment could be created by prefixing "entity" with "custom_", producing
                "custom_entity". Servers MUST return an appropriate failure status code for a
                request with an unrecognized path segment.</t>

        <section anchor="i18n" title="Internationalization Considerations">
            <t>There is value in supporting the ability to submit either a U-label (Unicode form of
                an IDN label) or an A-label (ASCII form of an IDN label) as a query argument to an
                RDAP service. Clients capable of processing non-ASCII characters may prefer a U-label since this
                is more visually recognizable and familiar than A-label strings, but clients using programmatic
                interfaces might find it easier to submit and display A-labels if they are unable to input U-labels with
                their keyboard configuration. Both query forms are acceptable.</t>

            <t>Internationalized domain and name server names can contain character variants and
                variant labels as described in RFC 4290 <xref target="RFC4290"/>. Clients that
                support queries for internationalized domain and name server names MUST accept
                service provider responses that describe variants as specified in "JSON Responses
                for the Registration Data Access Protocol" <xref target="I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response"/>.</t>

      <t>Search functionality typically requires more server resources (such as memory, CPU cycles, and network bandwidth) when compared to basic lookup functionality. This increases the risk of server resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service due to abuse. This risk can be mitigated by developing and implementing controls to restrict search functionality to identified and authorized clients. If those clients behave badly, their search privileges can be suspended or revoked. Rate limiting as described in Section 5.5 of "HTTP usage in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)" <xref target="I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http"/> can also be used to control the rate of received search requests. Server operators can also reduce their risk by restricting the amount of information returned in response to a search request.</t>
