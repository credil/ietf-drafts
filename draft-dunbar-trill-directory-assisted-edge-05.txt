Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


   RBridge edge nodes currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses
   and their corresponding RBridge edge nodes by observing the data
   packets traversed through. When ingress RBridge receives a data
   packet with its destination address (MAC&VLAN) unknown, the data
   packet is flooded across RBridge domain. When there are more than
   one RBridge ports connected to one bridged LAN, only one of them can
   be designated as AF port for forwarding/receiving traffic for each
   LAN, the rest have to be blocked for that LAN.

   This draft describes the framework of using directory assisted
   RBridge edge to improve TRILL network scalability in data center
   environment.

1. Introduction

   Data center networks are different from campus networks in several
   ways, in particular:

   1. Data centers, especially Internet or multi-tenant data centers,
     tend to have large number of hosts with a wide variety of
     applications.
   2. Topology is based on racks and rows.
         Hosts assignment to Servers, Racks, and Rows is orchestrated
          by Server/VM Management system, not at random.
   3. Rapid workload shifting in data centers can accelerate the
     frequency of one physical server being re-loaded with different
     applications. Sometimes, applications re-loaded to one physical
     server at different time can belong to different subnets.
   4. With server virtualization, there is an ever-increasing trend to
     dynamically create or delete VMs when demand for resource changes,
     to move VMs from overloaded servers, or to aggregate VMs onto
     fewer servers when demand is light.

   Both 3) and 4) above can lead to hosts in one subnet being placed
   under different locations (racks or rows) or one rack having hosts
   belonging to different subnets.

   This draft describes why and how Data Center TRILL networks can be
   optimized by utilizing a directory assisted approach.

3. Impact on RBridge domain of massive number of hosts in Data Center

   3.1. Issues of Flooding Based Learning in Data Centers

   It is common for Data Center networks to have multiple tiers of
   switches, e.g. one or two Access Switches for each server rack
   (ToR), aggregation switches for some rows (or EoR switches), and
   some core switches to interconnect the aggregation switches. Many
   aggregation switches deployed in data centers are high port density
   switches. It is not uncommon to see aggregation switches
   interconnecting hundreds of ToR switches.

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


   When TRILL is deployed in a data center with large number of hosts,
   with the possibility of hosts in one subnet/VLAN being placed under
   multiple edge RBridges and each edge RBridge having hosts from
   different subnets/VLANs, the following problems will occur:

        Unnecessary filling of slots in MAC table of edge RBridges, due
        to edge RBridge receiving broadcast/multicast traffic (e.g.
        ARP/ND, cluster multicast, etc.) from hosts under other edge
        RBridges that are not actually communicating with any hosts
        attached to the RBridge.
        Some edge RBridge ports being blocked for user traffic when
        there are more than one RBridge ports connected to one bridged
        LAN. When there are multiple RBridge ports connected to a
        bridged LAN, only one, i.e. the AF port, can forward/receive
        traffic for that bridged LAN (i.e. VLAN), the rest have to be
        blocked for forwarding/receiving traffic for that VLAN. When a
        rack has dual uplinks to two different ToR switches ( RBridge
        Edges), which is very common in data center environment, some
        links can't be fully utilized.
        Packets being flooded across RBridge domain when their DAs are
        not in ingress RBridge's cache.
        In an environment where VMs migrates, there is higher chance of
        cached entries becoming invalid, causing traffic to be black
        holed or re-flooded by the egress RBridge.   If VMs send out
        gratuitous ARP/ND or IEEE802.1Qbg's VDP upon arriving at new
        locations, the ingress nodes might not have the MAC entries for
        the newly arrived VMs, causing more unknown flooding.

   3.2. Some Examples

   Consider a data center with 1600 server racks. Each server rack has
   at least one ToR switch. The ToR switches are further divided to 8
   groups, with each group being connected by a set of aggregation
   switches.  There could be 4 to 8 aggregation switches in each set to
   achieve load sharing for traffic to/from server racks. If TRILL is
   to be deployed in this data center environment, let's consider
   following two scenarios for the TRILL domain boundary:

        Scenario #1: TRILL domain boundary starts at ToR switches:





Dunbar                  Expires Sept11, 2012                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


         If each server rack has one uplink to one ToR, there are 1600
         edge RBridges. If each rack has dual uplinks to two ToR
         switches, then there will be 3200 edge RBridges

         In this scenario, the RBridge domain will have more than 1600
         (or 3200) + 8*4 (or 8*8) nodes, which is quite a large IS-IS
         domain. Even though a mesh IS-IS domain can scale up to
         thousands of nodes, it is very challenging for aggregation
         switches to handle IS-IS link state advertisement among
         hundreds of parallel ports.

        Scenario #2: TRILL domain boundary starts at the aggregation
        switches:

         With the same assumption as before, the number of nodes in
         RBridge domain will be less than 100, and aggregation switches
         don't have to handle IS-IS link state advisements among
         hundreds of ports.

         But in this scenario, aggregation switches' downstream
         ports/links to ToR switches form the bridged LAN with links
         from ToR switches to servers.  With aggregation switches being
         the RBridge edge nodes, multiple RBridge edge ports could be
         connected to one bridged LAN. To avoid potential loops TRILL
         requires only one of multiple RBridge edge ports connected to
         one VLAN being designated as Appointed Forwarder (AF port) for
         forwarding native traffic across RBridge domain for that VLAN.
         That means other ports/links are blocked for native frames in
         that VLAN.

         There is also possibility of loops on the bridged LAN attached
         to RBridge edge ports unless STP/RSTP is running. Running
         traditional Layer 2 STP/RSTP on the bridged LAN in this
         environment may be overkill because the topology among the ToR
         switches and aggregation switches is very simple.

         In addition, the number of MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge Mapping
         entries to be learned and managed by RBridge edge node can be
         very large. In the example above, each edge RBridge has 200
         edge ports facing the ToR switches. If each ToR has 40
         downstream ports facing servers and each server has 10 VMs,
         there could be 200*40*10 = 80000 hosts attached. If all those
         hosts belong to 1600 VLANs (i.e. 50 per VLAN) and each VLAN has
         200 hosts, then under the worst case scenario, the total number

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


         of MAC&VLAN entries to be learned by the RBridge edge can be
         1600*200=320000, which is very large.

4. Benefits of Directory Assisted RBridge Edge in DC Environment

   In data center environment, applications placement to servers,
   racks, and rows is orchestrated by Server (or VM) Management
   System(s). I.e. there is a database or multiple ones (distributed
   model) which have the knowledge of where each host is located. If
   that host location information can be fed to RBridge edge nodes, in
   some form of Directory Service, then RBridge edge nodes won't need
   to flood data frames with unknown DA across RBridge domain.

   Avoiding unknown DA flooding to RBridge domain is especially
   valuable in data center environment because there is higher chance
   of an RBridge edge receiving packets with unknown DA and
   broadcast/multicast messages due to VM migration and servers being
   loaded with different applications.  When a VM is moved to a new
   location or a server is loaded with a new application with different
   IP/MAC addresses, it is more likely that the DA of data packets sent
   out from those hosts are unknown to their attached RBridge edges.
   In addition, gratuitous ARP (IPv4) or Unsolicited Neighbor
   Advertisement (IPv6) sent out from those newly migrated or activated
   hosts have to be flooded to other RBridge edges which have hosts in
   the same subnets.

   The benefits of using directory assistance include:

        Avoid flooding unknown DA across RBridge domain. The Directory
        enforced MAC&VLAN <-> RBridgeEdge mapping table can determine
        if a data packet needs to be forwarded across RBridge domain.

         When multiple RBridge edge ports are connected via bridged LAN
         to hosts (servers/VMs), a directory assisted RBridge edge won't
         need to flood unknown DA data frames to all ports of the
         RBridge edge. Under this circumstance, there is no chance for
         those data frames looping among multiple ports of RBridge edge.
         Therefore, it is no longer necessary to designate one Appointed
         Forwarder among all the RBridge Edge ports connected to a
         bridge LAN, which means that all RBridge ports can
         forward/receive traffic.

        Reduce flooding decapsulated Ethernet frames with unknown MAC-
        DA to a bridged LAN connected to RBridge edge ports.



Dunbar                  Expires Sept11, 2012                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


         When an RBridge receives a TRILL frame whose destination
         Nickname matches with its own, the normal procedure is for the
         RBridge to decapsulate the TRILL header and forward the
         decapsulated Ethernet frame to its directly attached bridged
         LAN. If the destination MAC is unknown, the decapsulated
         Ethernet frame is flooded in the LAN. With directory
         assistance, the RBridge edge can determine if DA in a frame
         matches with any hosts attached via the bridged LAN. Therefore,
         frames can be discarded if their DAs do not match.

        Reduce the amount of MAC&VLAN <-> RBridgeEdge mapping
        maintained by RBridge edge. There is no need for an RBridge
        edge to keep the MAC entries for hosts which don't communicate
        with hosts attached to the RBridge edge.

5. Generic operation of Directory Assistance

   5.1. Information in Directory Servers for TRILL

   To achieve the benefits of directory service for TRILL, the
   corresponding directory server will need minimum following
   attributes:

   [IP, MAC, attached RBridge nickname, {list of interested RBridges}]

   The {list of interested RBridges} would get populated when an
   RBridge queries for information, or pushed down from management
   systems. The list is used to notify those RBridges if VMs to
   RBridge's connectivity changes due to VMs migration or link
   failures.


   There can be two different models for RBridge edge node to be
   assisted by Directory Service: Push Model and Pull Model.

   5.2. Push Model

   Under this model, Directory Server(s) push down the MAC&VLAN <->
   RBridgeEdge mapping for all the hosts which might communicate with
   hosts attached to an RBridge edge node. With this environment, it is
   recommended that RBridge edge simply drop a data packet (instead of
   flooding to RBridge domain) if the packet's destination address
   can't be found in the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table.

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


   It may not be necessary for every RBridge edge to get the entire
   mapping table for all the hosts in a data center. There are many
   ways to narrow the full set down to a smaller set of remote hosts
   which communicate with hosts attached to an RBridge edge. A simple
   approach of only pushing down the mapping for the VLANs which have
   active hosts under an RBridge edge can reduce the number of mapping
   entries pushed down.

   However, it is inevitable that RBridge edge's MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge
   mapping table will have more entries than they really need under the
   Push Model. When hosts attached to one RBridge Edge rarely
   communicate with hosts attached to different RBridge edges even
   though they are on the same VLAN, the normal process of RBridge
   edge's unknown DA flooding, learning and cache aging would have
   removed those MAC&VLAN entries from the RBridge's cache. But it can
   be difficult for Directory Servers to predict the communication
   patterns among hosts within one VLAN. Therefore, it is likely that
   the Directory Servers will push down all the MAC&VLAN entries if
   there are hosts in the VLAN being attached to the RBridge Edge. This
   is a major disadvantage of push down model.

   In push down model, it is necessary to have a message for RBridge
   node to request directory server(s) to start pushing down the
   mapping entries. This message should at least include the number
   VLANs enabled on the RBridge, so that directory server doesn't need
   to push down the entire mapping entries for all the hosts in the
   data center. RBridge node can use this message to get mapping
   entries when it is initialized or restarted.

   The detailed message format and hand-shake mechanism between RBridge
   and Directory Server(s) will be described in a separate draft
   because this draft only focuses on the framework of directory
   assisted Edge.

   When directory pushes down the entire mapping to an edge RBridge for
   the very first time, there usually are many entries. To minimize the
   number of entries pushed down, summarization should be considered,
   e.g. with one edge RBridge Nickname being associated with all
   attached hosts' MAC addresses and VLANs as shown below:

            Table 1: Summarized table pushed down from directory

   Whenever there is any change in MAC&VLAN <-> RBridgeEdge mapping,
   which can be triggered by hosts being added, moved, or de-
   commissioned, an incremental update can be sent to the RBridge edges
   which are impacted by the change. Therefore, something like sequence
   number has to be maintained by directory servers and RBridges.
   Detailed mechanisms will be described in a separate draft.

   5.3. Pull model:

   Under this model, ''RBridge'' pulls the MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping
   entry from the directory server when needed. There are several
   options to trigger the pulling process. For example, the RBridge
   edge node can send a pulling request whenever it receives an unknown
   DA, or RBridge edge node can simply intercept all ARP/ND requests
   and forward them to the Directory Server(s) that has the information
   on where each host is located. RBridge ingress node can cache the
   mapping pulled down from the directory.

   One advantage of the Pull Model is that RBridge edge can age out
   MAC&VLAN entries if they haven't been used for a certain period of
   time. Therefore, each RBridge edge will only keep the entries which
   are frequently used, i.e. mapping table size can be smaller. RBridge
   edge would query the Directory Server(s) for unknown DAs in data
   frames or ARP/ND and cache the response. When hosts attached to one
   RBridge Edge rarely communicate with hosts attached to different
   RBridge edges even though they are on the same VLAN, the
   corresponding MAC&VLAN entries would be aged out from the RBridge's
   cache.

Internet-Draft     Directory Assisted RBridge edge          March 2011


   Some people are concerned of the performance with RBridge waiting
   for response from Directory Servers upon receiving a data frame with
   unknown DA. Actually this waiting practice is a common router
   behavior. Most deployed routers today do hold the packets and send
   an ARP/ND to the target upon receiving a packet with DA not in its
   IP-MAC cache. When ARP/ND replies are received, the router will send
   the data frame to the target. This practice is to minimize flooding
   when targets don't exist in the subnet.

   When the target doesn't exist in the subnet, routers generally re-
   send ARP/ND request a few more times before dropping the packets.
   Therefore, the holding time by routers to wait for ARP/ND response
   can be longer than the time taken by the Pull Model to get IP-MAC
   mapping from directory if target doesn't exist in the subnet.

   A separate draft will describe the detailed messages and mechanism
   for RBridge edge to pull information from directory server(s).

6. Conclusion and Recommendation

    The traditional RBridge learning approach of observing data plane
    can no longer keep pace with the ever growing number of hosts in
    Data center.

    Therefore, we suggest TRILL consider directory assisted
    approach(es). This draft only describes the basic framework of using
    directory assisted approach for RBridge edge nodes. More complete
    mechanisms will be described in separate drafts.
