Internet-Draft               ALTC Use Cases                December 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes some uses cases for the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP, [RFC4566]) Alternate Connectivity (ALTC) attribute.
   These use cases are specific to IPv4/IPv6 co-existence, IPv4/IPv6
   interworking and IPv6 migration.  Both IPv6-related unicast
   (Section 4) and multicast (Section 3) contexts are covered.

   For the use cases listed in Section 4:
   o  SBE/DBE are managed by the same administrative entity.
   o  No connectivity issue is encountered between SBEs/DBEs.
   o  No IPv6 connectivity issue is to be encountered between an IPv6-
      enabled UA and SBE/DBE.
   o  Symmetric RTP/RTCP [RFC4961] is used even for IPv6 flows so that
      no complications are encountered when firewalls are placed between
      the UA and DBE.

   These use cases motivate the need to define a simple and backward
   compatible extension to SDP to be able to convey both an IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses.  [I-D.boucadair-mmusic-altc] is an example providing
   such functionality.  The main features of ALTC are:*

   o  Simple
   o  Backwards-compatible
   o  Enables IPv6 transition, where the starting point is legacy IPv4
      UA's without ICE.
   o  Works with an IPv4-only core
   o  Works with middleboxes


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  SBE (Signaling Path Border Element) denotes a functional element,
      located at the boundaries of an ITAD (IP Telephony Administrative
      Domain, [RFC2871]), which is responsible for intercepting
      signaling flows received from User Agents and relay them to the
      core service platform.  A SBE may be located at the access segment
      (i.e., be the service contact point for User Agents) or be located
      at the interconnection with adjacent domains ([RFC6406]).  A SBE
      controls one or more DBEs.  SBE and DBE may be located in the same
      device (e.g., SBC [RFC5853]) or be separated.

   o  DBE (Data Path Border Element) denotes a functional element,
      located at the boundaries of an ITAD, which is responsible for
      intercepting media/data flows received from User Agents and relay
      them to another DBE (or media servers, e.g., announcement server

      or IVR).  An example of DBE is a media gateway intercepting RTP
      flows.  SBE may be located at the access segment (i.e., be the
      service contact point for User Agents) or be located at the
      interconnection with adjacent domains ([RFC6406]).

   o  Core service platform is a macro functional block including
      session routing, interfaces to advanced services and access
      control.  Figure 1 provides an overview of the overall
      architecture including SBE, DBE and Core service platform.

3.  Multicast Use Case

   Recently, a significant effort has been undertaken within IETF to
   specify new mechanisms to interconnect IPv6-only hosts to IPv4-only
   servers (e.g., [RFC6146]).  This effort covered exclusively unicast
   transfer mode.  An ongoing initiative, called multrans, has been
   launched to cover multicast issues to be encountered during IPv6
   transition.  The overall problem statement is documented in
   [I-D.jaclee-behave-v4v6-mcast-ps].

   A particular issue encountered in the context of IPv4/IPv6 co-
   existence and IPv6 transition of multicast services is the discovery
   of multicast group and source (refer to Section 3.4 of
   [I-D.jaclee-behave-v4v6-mcast-ps]):

   1.  An IPv6-only receiver requesting multicast content generated by
       an IPv4-only source:
       (1.1)  An ALG is required to help an IPv6 receiver to select the
              appropriate IP address when only the IPv4 address is
              advertised (e.g., using SDP); otherwise the access to the
              IPv4 multicast content can not be offered to the IPv6
              receiver.  The ALG may be located downstream the receiver.
              As such, the ALG does not know in advance whether the
              receiver is dual-stack or IPv6-only.  The ALG may be tuned
              to insert both the original IPv4 address and corresponding
              IPv6 multicast address using for instance the ALTC SDP
              attribute [I-D.boucadair-mmusic-altc].
       (1.2)  In order to avoid involving an ALG in the path, an IPv4-
              only source can advertise both its IPv4 address and IPv4-
              embedded IPv6 multicast address
              [I-D.boucadair-behave-64-multicast-address-format] using
              for instance the ALTC SDP attribute
              [I-D.venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework].
   2.  A dual-stack source sending its multicast content over IPv4 and
       IPv6: both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses need to be inserted in the SDP
       part.  A means (e.g, ALTC) is needed for this purpose.


4.  Introducing IPv6 into SIP-based Architectures

4.1.  Avoid Crossing CGN Devices

   Some service providers are in the process of enabling DS-Lite
   [RFC6333] as a means to continue delivering IPv4 services to their
   customers.  To avoiding crossing four levels of NAT when placing a
   media session (2 NAT in DS-Lite AFTR + 2 NAT in the DBE), it is
   recommended to enable IPv6 functions in some SBEs/DBEs.  Therefore
   DS-Lite AFTRs won't be crossed for DS-Lite serviced customers if
   their UA is IPv6-enabled:

   o  For SIP UA embedded in the CPE, this is easy to implement since
      the SIP UA [RFC3261] can be tuned to behave as IPv6-only UA when
      DS-Lite is enabled.  No ALTC is required for that use case.
   o  But for SIP User Agents located behind the CPE, a solution to
      indicate both IPv4 and IPv6 are required in order to avoid
      crossing the DS-Lite CGN.  For the NAT traversal, PCP can be used
      for that purpose [I-D.boucadair-pcp-rtp-rtcp].  This would allow
      to avoid embedding SIP ALG in the DS-Lite CGN, avoid impacting the
      SBE by the HNT function and reduce keepalive messages.  Both DS-
      Lite AFTR and SBE are not overloaded by keepalive messages.

4.2.  Basic Scenario for IPv6 SIP Service Delivery

   A basic solution to deliver SIP-based services using IPv4-only core
   service platform to IPv6-enabled UA is to enabled IPv4/IPv6
   interworking function in SBE/DBE.  Signaling and media between two
   SBEs and DBEs is maintained over IPv4.  IPv6 is used between an IPv6-
   enabled UA and a SBE/DBE.

   Figure 2 shows the results of session establishment between UAs.  In
   this scenario, IPv4/IPv6 interworking function is invoked even when
   both involved UAs are IPv6-enabled.

   may be valuable to consider by service providers.

4.3.  Avoid IPv4/IPv6 Interworking

   For services providers wanting:
   1.  Means to promote the invocation of IPv6 transfer capabilities can
       be enabled while no parsing error is to be experienced by core
       service nodes legacy nodes
   2.  Optimize cost related to IPv4-IPv6 translation licenses
   3.  Reduce the dual-stack lifetime
   4.  Maintain an IPv4-only core
   5.  Only a set of SBE/DBE are IPv6-enabled

   A solution to indicate both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses is required.
   This section provides an overview of this procedure:

   When a SBE receives an INVITE, it instantiates in its DBE an IPv6-
   IPv6 context and an IPv6-IPv4 context.  Both an IPv6 address and an
   IPv4 address are returned together with other information such as
   port numbers.  SBE builds an SDP offer including both IPv4 and IPv6-
   related information using ALTC attribute.  IPv6 is indicated as
   preferred connectivity type.

                     o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 192.0.2.2
                     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
                     m=audio 12340 RTP/AVP 0 8
                     a=altc IP6 2001:db8::2 6000
                     a=altc IP4 192.0.2.2 12340

                  Figure 3: SDP offer updated by the SBE

   The request is then forwarded to the core SPF which in its turn
   forwards the requests to the terminating SBE.

   o  If this SBE is a legacy one, then it will ignore ALTC attributes
      and use "c" line.
   o  If the terminating SBE is IPv6-enabled:
      *  If the called UA is IPv4-only, then an IPv6-IPv4 context is
         created in the corresponding DBE.
      *  If the called UA is IPv6-enabled, then an IPv6-IPv6 context is
         created in the corresponding DBE.

   Figure 4 shows the result of the procedure when placing a session
   between an IPv4 and IPv6 UAs while Figure 5 shows the results of
   establishing a session between two IPv6-enabled UAs.  The result is
   still not optima since redundant NAT66 is required (Section 4.4).

4.4.  DBE Bypass Procedure

   For service providers wanting to involve only one DBE in the media
   path, when not all SBE/DBE and UAs are IPv6-enabled, a means to
   indicate both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses without inducing session
   failures is required.  Below is proposed an example of a proposed
   procedure using ALTC attribute.

   When the originating SBE receives an INVITE from an IPv6-enabled UA,
   it instantiates in its DBE an IPv6-IPv6 context and an IPv6-IPv4
   context.  Both an IPv6 address and an IPv4 address are returned
   together with other information such as port numbers.  SBE builds an

   SDP offer including both IPv4 and IPv6-related information using ALTC
   attribute (Figure 6).  IPv6 is indicated as preferred connectivity
   type.

                  Figure 6: SDP offer updated by the SBE

   The request is then forwarded to the core SPF which in its turn
   forwards the requests to the terminating SBE:
   o  If the destination UA is IPv6 or reachable with a public IPv4
      address, the SBEs only forwards the request without altering the
      SDP offer.  No parsing error is experienced by core service nodes
      since ALTC is backward compatible.
   o  If the terminating SBE does not support ALTC, it will ignore this
      attribute an uses the legacy procedure.

   As a consequence, only one DBE is maintained in the path when one of
   the involved parties is IPv6-enabled.  Figure 7 shows the overall
   procedure when involved UAs are IPv6-enabled.

   The main advantages of such solutions are as follows:

   o  DBE resources are optimized

Internet-Draft               ALTC Use Cases                December 2011


   o  No redundant NAT is maintained in the path when IPv6-enabled UAs
      are involved
   o  End-to-end delay is optimized
   o  The robustness of the service is optimized since the delivery of
      the service relies on fewer nodes
   o  The signaling path is also optimized since no communication
      between the SBE (through SPDF in TISPAN/IMS context) and DBE at
      the terminating side is required for some sessions.

4.5.  Direct Communications Between IPv6-enabled User Agents

   For service providers wanting to allow direct IPv6 communications
   between IPv6-enabled UAs, when not all SBE/DBE and UA are IPv6-
   enabled, a means to indicate both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses without
   inducing session failures is required.  Below is proposed an example
   of a proposed procedure using ALTC attribute.

   At the SBE originating side, when the SBE receives an INVITE from the
   calling IPv6 UA (Figure 8), it updates uses the ALTC to indicate two
   IP addresses:
   1.  An IPv4 address belonging to its controlled DBE
   2.  The same IPv6 address and port as received in the initial offer
       made by the calling IPv6

   Figure 9 shows an excerpt example of the SDP offer generated by the
   originating SBE.

                    o=- 25678 753849 IN IP6 2001:db8::1
                    c=IN IP6 2001:db8::1
                    m=audio 12340 RTP/AVP 0 8

                   Figure 8: SDP offer of the calling UA

                     o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 192.0.2.2
                     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
                     m=audio 12340 RTP/AVP 0 8
                     a=altc IP6 2001:db8::1 6000
                     a=altc IP4 192.0.2.2 12340

                  Figure 9: SDP offer updated by the SBE

   The INVITE message will be routed appropriately to the destination
   SBE:
   1.  If the SBE is a legacy device (i.e., IPv4-only); it will ignore
       IPv6 addresses and contacts its DBE to instantiate an IPv4-IPv4
       context.

   2.  If the SBE is IPv6-enabled, it will only forwards the INVITE to
       the address of contact of the called party:
       A.  If the called party is IPv6-enabled, the communication will
           be placed using IPv6.  As such no DBE is involved in the data
           path as illustrated in Figure 10.
       B.  If not, IPv4 will be used between the originating DBE and
           called UA.
