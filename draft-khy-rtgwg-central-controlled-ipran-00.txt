2.  Requirements and use case for central controlled IP RAN

2.1.  Scenarios of traditional IP RAN

   IP RAN is mainly used to carry the traffic from 3G, LTE base station
   to provide the carrier of high speed service for IP-based mobile back
   haul.

   The normal topology in IP RAN is based on ring or tree.  When L3
   service is required in metro, aggregation and access area, IP RAN
   usually uses ring topology to form the network.

   Fig. 1 shows a typical network topology of IP RAN.  There are two
   layers: access layer and aggregation layer.  The access devices are
   the edge of the IP RAN, and are used for the service access; The
   aggregation devices are used to aggregate the traffic from access
   devices.

   The traffic from base station goes via FE/GE to access device. Access
   device will establish two redundant pseudowires to two aggregation
   devices.  Aggregation device will terminate the pseudowires and get
   into the L3VPN.  Two aggregation devices will work as the gateway for
   L3 services, and provide the protection for the base station service.
    The service core network element will access the metro core after
   the aggregation of CE, and are connected with base station through
   L3VPN.

   multiplexing clock transportation.  The routing based hardware
   structure has rich L3 routing functions.  It can provide the better
   multi-service carrier, and support multi-point to multi-point
   communication scenario in future mobile network.  Compared with
   traditional IP metro network, IP RAN solution will focus on the high
   availability, simplified operation and management, networking
   intelligence and OPEX saving from end to end, etc.

   The problems in traditional IP RAN network

   Network high availability
         IP RAN is based on the traditional IP router platform, it uses
         complicated IP and MPLS protocols to construct the network with
         huge amount of devices.  This is a challenge to the high
         availability of network deployment

   Complexity of network management
         IP RAN deployment usually involves a lot of IP MPLS devices,
         this will introduce very complicated issues in network
         management and operation.  In a typical big metro area, for a
         local network with the scale of 10k base stations, we need to
         increase the network with 10500 IP/MPLS equipments.  The IP
         network scale (equipment number) will increase 10 times, and
         equipment is distributed divergently.  This will cause the
         operation pressure to carriers they nerve faced before.  In
         addition to that, there are many protocols running between
         access and aggregation devices, network operators must
         understand and memory lot information regarding to protocols
         and network structures.  It increases the complexity of network
         operation, and brings more OPEX to carriers.

   Low intelligence in network
         The time gaps in the mobile network evolving from 2G to 3G and
         to 4G are decreasing.  New value added service and application
         keep coming up.  The question about how to quickly deploy new 
         service and establish the dynamic maintenances will bring in
         more harsh technical requirements to traditional IP RAN.

   Using the architecture of central control, separation of control
   plane and forwarding plane, open and programmability, we can find out
   the solution for the network high availability, complexity of
   operation and management, network intelligence.

   The network structure of central controlled IP RAN is illustrated in
   Fig. 2 to Fig. 4.  The network is still layered as access and
   aggregation layers.  There is central controller to provide the
   control capability of topology discovery, path calculation and
   service establishment.  There are three modes for central controller,
   one is built-in controller mode and other two are separated
   controller mode but for different scope of network. Details for these
   models and architectures are given in section 3 of the same document.

2.3.1.  Mode 1: Built-in Controller

   For this mode, the controller is integrated into aggregation routers.
   There may be multiple controller in a IP RAN.

2.3.2.  Mode 2: Stand-alone Controller for Access and Aggregation

   For this mode, the stand-alone central controller is used.  The
   control functions in access and aggregation devices are moved to the
   controller server named IPRAN-CP in this document.  In such a way,
   the access and aggregation devices are only responsible for the
   forwarding.  The controller can control multiple aggregation and
   access devices.

2.3.3.  Mode 3: Stand-alone Controller for Access and Aggregation

   For this mode, the stand-alone central controller is used too.  The
   difference from the mode 2 is that the controller will control the
   access and aggregation layers include RSG. This mode can provide the
   control capability from end to end.

   Fig 5. Central Controlled IP RAN Architecture




   Above is the central controlled IP RAN architecture, where the
   control plane is separated from the forwarding plane and moved to an
   independent entity named IPRAN-CP (IP RAN Control Plane) in this
   document.

   IPRAN-CP, IP RAN Control Plane, is a software system that can be
 


XXX                                                            [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Central Controlled IP RAN            July 9, 2013


   deployed either in a network device or a separate computer server.
   IPRAN-CP controls the entire IP RAN network domain, the size of the
   domain can be defined by Network Operator based on the actual network
   planning and use cases.  IPRAN-CP controls the IP RAN network based
   on the network topology, actual states and status, which are operated
   by the network administrator.

   IPRAN-CP provides northbound interface to network management system
   used for service deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting, fault
   location, and other functions. Netconf could be  one of the option
   for northbound interface implementation.  The northbound interface of
   IPRAN-CP is different from the traditional network equipment
   interfaces.  It is based on the network view and virtual interfaces.
   IPRAN-CP can provide the interface to network topology and operate on
   a virtual network.

   At the same time, IPRAN-CP also opens to third-party application,
   allows third party to use RESTful API to program and control network
   devices.  Through IPRAN-CP, Third-party applications can utilize the
   access to network resources (such as network topology), deliver
   network diagnosis, fault location, application performance
   monitoring, add innovative applications in the future and so on.

   Because the control plane has been separated out, the network devices
   become forwarding nodes in the IP RAN domain.  Forwarding nodes still
   keep the basic routing functions in order to establish control and
   management channel between IPRAN-CP/NMG and all the forwarding nodes.
   Other control functionality is moved to IPRAN-CP, the forwarding node
   no longer has the control plane functions (such as protocols needed
   for establishing services). Forwarding node accepts network resources
   and states from the controller via Control Agent module and reports
   itself (such as ports) to the controller.

   Forwarding nodes still need traditional northbound managemnent
   interface.  However northbound interface features of the network
   services and the protocol are no longer included. Instead only a
   small subset of the features such as power supplies, voltages,
   veneers and other management features are remained on the network
   devices. The forwarding plane continues to  maintain the existing
   schema using IP/MPLS forwarding.

3.2.  Reference Model

   According to different use cases and scenarios, typical reference
   model can be either in built-in model or stand-alone model. Where the
   stand-alone model can be divided into another two different sub
   models

     Fig 6. Central Controlled IPRAN in Built-in Model




   Like the one above in an IP RAN network, IPRAN-CP functionality is
   built into aggregation service gateway ASG, in which an ASG controls
   a group of CSGs connected to it.  IPRAN-CP functionality is
   integrated with ASG that retains its original aggregation features. 
   The original control functionality on CSG is moved up to ASG. The ASG
   with built-in IPRAN-CP controls the forwarding behavior of CSG. CSG
   retains basic routing functions for establishing the communication
   channel with management plane and control plane. CSG communicates
   with IPRAN-CP through a control agent running on CSG, the agent
   performs status reporting and accepts control information distributed
   by the central control plane residing on ASG.

   In this reference model, an IP RAN domain can have more than one ASG,
   every ASG has a built-in IPRAN-CP.  A CSG can be controlled by a
   single or multiple(in ring structure) ASG(s). In case there are two
   or more ASGs, one ASG works as master controller, and the other one
   works as alternative backup.  IPRAN-CP can also do load-balancing. 
   In case of CSG redundancy, each active and standby can be controlled
   by different ASG.

 


XXX                                                            [Page 12]

   IPRAN-DP supports the network virtualization capabilities, internal
   CSG topology of an IP RAN is not visible to external network.  For
   external routing device, it only establishes routing neighbor with
   ASG, and believes that only the ASG routes while the CSG routes are
   invisible.  External routing equipment can considered an IPRAN-CP
   controlled domain is a big virtual router.

   Using built-in mode, the one can use the existing network equipment
   to perform software upgrades, apply the new control technology in the
   access network.  Changes to the network architecture and network
   management model can be limited to small. It is a good strategy to
   conduct the rapid deployment of central controlled IP RAN.

3.2.2.  Central Controlled IP RAN in Stand-alone Model

   Built-in IPRAN-CP is easy of deployment and takes advantage of
   existing network structure, equipments and other investment.  However
   because there is no separation of control plane and forwarding plane
   on the existing device that IPRAN-CP attached to, for example ASG,
   the control ability, network performance and the domain scope are
   limited by the capability of the existing aggregation equipment ASG
   and its attached network structure.

   Stand-alone IPRAN-CP model is designed to resolve above issue.  It
   deploys IPRAN-CP with stand-alone computer server(s) or other IT
   hardware to eliminate the physical limitation of ASG.  The stand-
   alone control server can use the commodity product with much stronger
   CPU power and process ability. The controller no longer participates
   in the forwarding of network traffic like ASG does; it can be located
   in a remote data center without geographical limitation thus it is
   able to control more and more network nodes in different locations. 
   Therefore stand-alone IPRAN-CP can provide higher scalability and
   batter performance.

Internet-Draft         Central Controlled IP RAN            July 9, 2013


    Fig 7. Central Controlled IP RAN in Stand-alone Model




   Above diagram shows a use case of stand-alone IP RAN control plane.
   Where IPRAN-CP software is pulled out from ASG and running on a
   separate computer server (or in a proprietary device, this document
   follow-up to the server instead).  The servers do not participate in
   the forwarding of network traffic. The network devices to be
   controlled by IPRAN-CP can be vary depending on the scope of the
   actual needs. You can only control access layer equipment, or you can
   also control the devices include both access layer and aggregation
   layer.

   Different from built-in IPRAN-CP on ASG, a stand-alone control plane
   can control and manage many CSGs as well as ASG itself, or more than
   one ASGs with CSGs connected to them. If needed, it can also control
   even RSGs in an extended IP RAN domain.  In this use case, CSG, ASG
   as well as RSG are integrated with a Control Agent module.  Control
   Agent is responsible for reporting topology, states and statistics to
   IPRAN-CP; and receiving control information and forwarding tables
   from IPRAN-CP.  The network devices include CSG, ASG and RSG keep
   basic routing functions for establishing control channel and
   management channel so that IPRAN-CP can use CP-DP (control plane and
   data plane) protocol to control these devices.

   IPRAN-CP needed to support network virtualization functions, from the
   view of the external network devices, this IPRAN domain is just a
   single logical router.  If any forwarding device (for example CSG)
   within the domain has communicated with external network nodes using
   traditional routing protocol such as BGP,IGP,LDP or RSVP, the central
   controlled IPRAN-CP must support the same communication channel and
   support the same routing protocols on behalf of the forwarding
   devices.

3.2.3.  Functional Block

   This section describes the functions and features to be supported by
   the control plane and forwarding plane respectively.

   The functions of IPRAN-CP:

   o  CP-DP control protocol features: provide forwarding device control
      information; establish and maintain connections between control
      plane and the forwarding nodes. CP-DP protocol can be XMPP,
      Openflow, or a newly defined protocol.

   o  Network resource management features: discover and collect the
      forwarding nodes, the ports on the nodes as well as topology
      resources in the IP RAN domain.  Other software modules can use
      the resource collection to calculate path, deploying services, and
      build forwarding tables etc.  IPRAN-CP should also open to network
      management applications and third-party applications to programm
      and manage the network resources.

   o  Network virtualization features: abstract network and shield the
      physical network details from the service layer.  Operational
      service deployment can be done based on virtual network without
      concernning how forwarding path for the virtual network to get
      through at the lower layer.  In IP RAN, the transport uses MPLS,
      the network virtualization here means MPLS virtualization.

   o  Network protocol layer: provides traditional routers supported
      conventional routing protocol stack, which was running on the
      forwarding nodes.  Now these features are moved up to the central
      controller.

   o  Network service layer: Supports IP RAN required L2VPN and L3VPN
      services. L2VPN including VPWS and VPLS.

   o  Supporting module: provides basic tools include fault location,
      alarm, northbound interface for maintenance and management
      capabilities.

   The functions of forwarding node:


   o  Basic routing features: run IGP routing protocol and responsible
      for establishing connectivity with other devices, setup routes and
      collect topology.  It must be done before a controller can
      communicate with the network devices.

   o  Control protocols: corresponds to the control protocol running on
      the IPRAN-CP device, responsible for establish and maintain CP-DP
      connection.

   o  Control Agent: Responsible for the registration with IPRAN-CP;
      reporting its information to the controller; accepting control
      information and forwarding tables distributed by the IPRAN-DP. 
      Control Agent is also responsible to install the forwarding tables
      to the data plane that is used to guide the traffic forwarding.

   o  Forwarding Plane: forwarding and procession of messages and user
      traffics.

   o  Support module: provides debug and diagnostics functions on
      forwarding nodes; supports device management features; provides
      interface to network management (include power supplies, voltages,
      etc).

3.2.4.  Interface Definition

   The interfaces given on above diagrams (refer to Fig 7) are described
      at below.

   o  I1: Interface between base station and forwarding node. It keeps
      traditional IP RAN network and base station interface, remains no
      change.

   o  I2: Interface between forwarding nodes.

      *  Forwarding nodes run extended ISIS for topology advertisements
         between nodes.  ISIS has been widely used in the existing IP
         RAN networks to flood link and node information, therefore,
         ISIS can be leveraged for central controlled IP RAN as part of
         the topology collection and flood protocol.

      *  With built-in model, because IPRAN-CP is running on an existing
         network devices such ASG, ISIS is running directly between the
         ASG and the CSG, IPRAN-CP on ASG can get topology information
         from ISIS directly.

      *  With stand-alone model, because SDN IPRAN-CP may be deployed
         outside of the actual physical network, the control plane
         cannot communication with forwarding plane via ISIS directly. 
         In this case, a selected topology collection agent in the
         network will be needed.  The agent gathers network topology
         information from CSGs through ISIS protocol, and then reports
         the information to IPRAN-CP through a CP-DP protocol.  An IP
         RAN may have very large number of network nodes, while the
         ability of access equipment is limited.  Hence it could be
         required to divide a IP RAN network into smaller ISIS domains
         to match the capacity of the access equipment.  The topology
         collection agent usually is located at ASBR node of ISIS such
         as ASG.

   o  I3: Interface between IPRAN-CP and forwarding devices.  This
      interface needs to run a CP-DP protocol for the forwarding node's
      registration, information reporting, and accepting the control
      information. Options of the CP-DP protocols could be XMPP,
      OpenFlow or a newly defined protocols.  This interface is beyond
      scope thus left out of this document.

   o  I4: Interface between IPRAN-CP and external router.  It supports
      conventional routing protocols such as BGP,ISIS,RSVP and LDP etc.

   o  I5: Interface between RSG and base station controllers.  It
      remains unchanged. (I5 and BSC are not shown on Fig 7 due to space
      limitation)

3.2.5.  Management Plane

   IPRAN-CP needs to provide northbound interface used for network
   management and OSS integration.  At the same time, IPRAN-CP needs to
   provide an open programming interface used for third-party
   application integration and development.  For example, when a third-
   party monitoring application caught a situation of packet dropping
   and link quality degradation along a path, they can use programming
   interfaces of IPRAN-CP to control the path and switch to an
   alternative path.  The northbound interface provided by IPRAN-CP can
   be divided into the following categories:

   o  Policy control interface, including routing policy, ACL etc.

   o  The service interface, including L2VPN,L3VPN etc.

   o  Path control interface, including control of the forwarding path,
      switching over, definition of bandwidth constraints etc.

   o  Monitoring interface, including fault events, network quality
      threshold, system status monitoring, and statistics etc.

   o  Resource interfaces, including bandwidth, network topology, tag
      resources, interface resources etc.

   o  Diagnostic tools, such as ping, tracert, NQA etc.


   Forwarding nodes also have a light network management plane.  The
   management uses VPN channel separated from CP-DP channel to manage
   the forwarding node.  Because forwarding node's control plane has
   been moved up to IPRAN-CP, therefore management functionality
   provided by the forwarding nodes, are only themselves the equipment
   management features as follows:

   o  Equipment upgrades

   o  Device management protocols, such as SNMP, Telnet, and FTP etc

   o  Port management

   o  Device power, voltage, single-board hardware management features
      such as alarms, veneer restarts.

   o  Environmental monitoring of the device, such as temperature alarms
      etc.
