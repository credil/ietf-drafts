Internet-Draft             L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB               January 2013


1.  Introduction

   Multicast in VPLS and VPN can be achieved by using provider tunnels
   to deliver to all or a subset of PEs.  The signaling of provider
   tunnel choice is very similar for both VPLS and VPN multicast (aka
   MVPN), and this memo describes managed objects common to both VPLS
   Multicast [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast] and MVPN [RFC 6513/6514].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Summary of MIB Module

   L2L3-VPN-MCAST-MIB ontains a Textual Convention,
   L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType, and a
   l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable.  Other MIB objects ([I-D.ietf-
   l2vpn-vpls-mcast], [I-D. ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-mib]) may point to entries
   in the l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable.
