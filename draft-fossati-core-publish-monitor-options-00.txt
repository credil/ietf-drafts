                  Publish and Monitor Options for CoAP
             draft-fossati-core-publish-monitor-options-00

Abstract

   This memo defines two additional Options for the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) especially targeted at sleepy sensors:
   Publish and Monitor.

   The Publish Option enables opportunistic updates of a given resource
   state, by temporarily delegating the authority of the Publish'ed
   resource to a Proxy node.  The whole process is driven by the
   (sleepy) origin -- which may actually never need to listen.

   The Monitor Option complements the typical Observe pattern, enabling
   the tracking of a resource hosted by a node sleeping most of the
   time, by taking care of establishing and maintaining an Observe
   relationship with the (sleepy) origin on behalf of the (sleepy)
   client.

Internet-Draft    Publish and Monitor Options for CoAP     February 2012


1.  Introduction

   The proposal described in this memo covers the following use case:

      a node N, which is sleeping most of the time, depends one or more
      resources hosted at another sleepy node M. In cases as such, the
      probability of an empty intersection between their respective wake
      periods is very high, making it hard for the two to synchronize.

   In this scenario, using the basic observe [I-D.ietf-core-observe]
   functionality is not enough, as it could lead to lost state updates
   in case N is offline while M pushes its notifications; further, the
   observation may never bootstrap since its initialization needs both
   client and origin awake at the same time.

   This memo introduces two extensions to the Proxy caching
   functionality that give the Proxy an explicit mediation role in the
   sleepy-to-sleepy CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-coap] communication.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Sleepy Device:  a sensor/actuator (usually battery operated) that
      switches off its radio beyond the normal radio duty cycle in order
      to save energy.

   Proxy mediation role:  TBD

1.2.  Motivation

   This memo focuses on the requirement REQ3 of
   [I-D.shelby-core-coap-req]:

   REQ3:   The ability to deal with sleeping nodes.  Devices may be
           powered off at any point in time but periodically "wake up"
           for brief periods of time.

   |  YY | Critical | Publish | (none) | 0 B    | (none)  |
   |  XX | Critical | Monitor | (none) | 0 B    | (none)  |
   +-----+----------+---------+--------+--------+---------+

2.1.  Publish Option

   The Publish Option enables the sleepy origin to temporarily (i.e. for
   a specified "lease" time) delegate the authority of one of its hosted
   resources to a Proxy node that will start to behave as a Reverse
   Proxy for the Publish'ed resource.  It allows a sleepy sensor to use
   the Proxy as the rendezvous point for one-way sleepy to sleepy
   signaling.

2.1.1.  Publish a resource

   P        S
   |   PUT  | Proxy-URI: coap://thing.example.org/res
   |<-------+ Publish: <empty>
   |    r   | Content-Type: text/plain
   |        | ETag: 0xabcd
   |        | Max-Age: 1200
   |        |
   |  2.01  |
   +------->|
   |        |

                                 Figure 1

   The origin server publish one of its hosted resources, specified by
   the enclosed Proxy-URI, by PUT'ing it to the Proxy with a Publish
   Option attached.  The Proxy, which is voluntarily given the authority
   by the origin of the resource for the "lease" time specified by Max-
   Age, replies with a 2.01 if the authority transfer has succeeded.  An
   exact duplicate of the submitted representation is created, and from
   now on it can be accessed using the original URI provided that
   clients go through the delegated Proxy.  If the Publish operation
   does not succeed, an appropriate [TBD] response code is returned.

   ETag MAY be supplied to hint the underlying cache.  If no Max-Age is
   given, a default of 3600 seconds MUST be assumed.  The Max-Age value,
   both implicit or explicit, determines the lifetime of the implied
   origin delegation.  When the Max-Age value is elapsed, the Proxy MUST
   delete the Publish'ed resource value.

Internet-Draft    Publish and Monitor Options for CoAP     February 2012


   The Publish Option is critical and MUST be present in the request
   only.  If the Proxy does not recognize it, a 4.02 (Bad Option) MUST
   be returned to the client.

   It is sufficient for any client wishing to access the resource to do
   so using the Proxy node that, following the Publish operation, will
   start behaving as a Reverse Proxy, satisfying requests on behalf of
   the sleeping node.

   An interesting outcome of this communication strategy is that the
   sleepy origin may really never need to listen on its radio interface.

   [[OPEN ISSUE 1: Do we need to define how to explicitly un-publish a
   resource?]]

2.2.  Monitor Option

   The Monitor Option is a variant of the Observe Option that is aimed
   at solving some issues that may occur when sleepy sensors are
   involved.

   Suppose that the resource of interest is not in cache, and a sleepy
   endpoint wants to Observe it through the Proxy.  If the origin of the
   requested resource is sleeping at the time the observation is
   requested, the requesting node gets an error, and may need to stay
   awake and retry until the target node gets ready -- which is clearly
   not an option in case the sensor has a very small duty cycle.

   The Monitor Option is used to ask a Proxy to keep a given resource
   fresh by observing it, while the requesting node is sleeping.  Thus
   the sleepy sensor can possibly get the latest representation
   published by the monitored resource when it wakes up, even if the
   origin is sleeping -- and was sleeping at the time the Monitor has
   been requested.

   The Monitor Option is critical and MUST be present in the request
   only.  If the Proxy does not recognize it, a 4.02 (Bad Option) MUST
   be returned to the client.

2.2.1.  Public Monitor Registration

   P        C
   |  POST  | Proxy-URI: coap://sleepy.example.org/res
   |<-------+ Monitor: <empty>
   |        | Max-Age: 86400
   |        | Content-Type: application/json
   |  2.01  |
   +------->| Location-Path: temp
   |        | Location-Path: res
   |        |

                                 Figure 2

   The client POST's the resource to be monitored, identified by the
   Proxy-URI.  The request message contains an empty Monitor Option, and
   possibly specifies a TTL (i.e. an implicit de-registration
   indication) for the monitor through Max-Age.  One or more content
   types for the acceptable representations of the resource are
   optionally specified via the Accept option.  In case no TTL is
   supplied, a default value of 3600 seconds is assumed.

   The operation creates a "monitor" resource at the Proxy, that MUST
   maintain a fresh carbon copy of one or more representations of the
   requested resource depending on the supplied Content-Type's.  For
   convenience, multiple "monitor" resources corresponding to the same
   target resource, can be coalesced into the same monitor object at the
   Proxy -- possibly with the same URI.  In such case, a set containing
   one entry for each registered client is kept, which holds the client
   identities, their expiry and one or more preferred media types for
   their representation(s).  When all entries are deleted (either
   because clients have explicitly deregistered the monitor, or the
   monitor period has expired), the corresponding "monitor" object is
   deleted.  Note that an underlying cache entry MAY still be kept in
   case the cached representation(s) are still fresh (i.e. the Max-Age
   of the "monitor" resource and Max-Age of the target resource have
   completely different semantics.)

   If the monitor resource is successfully created, the server MUST
   return a 2.01 response containing one or more Location-Path and/or
   Location-Query Options to identify the monitored resource instance,
   which can be used from now on by the requester as an alias to the
   target resource.

   At a later time, the client wakes up and wants to access the
   monitored resource.  It does so by requesting the Proxy monitor
   resource that has been previously created.

   P        C
   |   GET  | URI-Path: temp
   |<-------+ URI-Path: res
   |        | Accept: application/json
   |        |
   |  2.05  |
   +------->| (Content)
   |        |
   |        |

                                 Figure 3

   In case the observation on the target node has not been started
   because the Proxy has not yet been able to contact the origin, the
   Proxy will return a [TBD] error code.

   In case the requested resource was not present on the origin, the
   Proxy will return an empty response (i.e. one with no payload.)

   In case the monitor resource is not found in the Proxy, either
   because the Proxy has rebooted and lost its state, or the monitor
   resource has been de-registered (see Section 2.2.2), a 4.04 response
   code is returned to the client -- that can recreate it, if needed.

2.2.2.  Monitor De-registration

   The monitor object MUST be deleted at the Proxy when all its
   associated resources have been de-registered or have expired.

   In order to save storage, a Proxy MAY decide to delete a monitor
   resource in case it has not been requested for a sufficiently long
   time, or for any other reason.  Note that the Proxy may also reboot
   and lose its state, including the state associated to any monitored
   resource.  The requester can realize that the state at the Proxy has
   been lost, and re-instantiate the monitor, when it receives an
   unexpected 4.04 from the "monitor" resource.

2.2.2.1.  Explicit De-registration

   P        C
   | DELETE | Path: temp
   |<-------+ Path: res
   |        |
   |  2.02  |
   +------->|
   |        |

Internet-Draft    Publish and Monitor Options for CoAP     February 2012


   Explicit de-registration is performed by a client, with a DELETE on
   the URI returned by the Proxy on the corresponding registration.

2.2.2.2.  Implicit De-registration

   Implicit de-registration MUST occur when the monitoring period
   specified by the client via Max-Age expires.  If no Max-Age was
   supplied at registration time, a default of 3600 seconds MUST be
   assumed.

2.2.3.  Resource Refresh

   In order to minimize the number of messages used by the monitoring
   process, the Proxy MUST try to install an observation on the
   requested resource.  In case this first attempt fails, the Proxy MAY
   fall back to repeated poll whose duration is upper bounded by the
   Max-Age value indicated by the client during registration.

   Usual cache validation MUST be applied to the cached copy of the
   monitored resource.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The following entries are added to the CoAP Option Numbers registry:

   .------------------------------.
   | Number | Name    | Reference |
   :--------:---------:-----------:
   |  2n+1  | Publish | RFC XXXX  |
   +--------+---------+-----------+
   |  2m+1  | Monitor | RFC XXXX  |
   `------------------------------'


5.  Security Considerations

   Threat:  cache poisoning.
   Countermeasure:  authenticate sender.

   Threat:  unauthorized de-registration
   Countermeasure:  authenticate requester.

   Threat:  Proxy resources' exhaustion.
   Countermeasure:  authenticate requester + quota limit.

   Threat:  global state loss.
   Countermeasure:  cache redundancy.
