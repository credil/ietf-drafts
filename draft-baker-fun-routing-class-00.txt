Abstract

   This note addresses the concept of routing a traffic class.  This has
   many possible implementations, IGP and BGP, and link state as well as
   distance vector.  The fundamental impetus is the question raised in
   RFC 3704 and shim6 of exit routing, the question raised by Mike
   O'Dell of source/destination routing, and the "fish" problem, raised
   in many networks, in which distinct traffic classes that could
   conceivably use the same route predictably use different routes.
   Instead of handling these as "destination routing with a twist", the
   paper looks at the matter systemically.

Internet-Draft           Routing a Traffic Class               July 2011


1.  Introduction

   This note addresses the concept of routing a traffic class.  This has
   many possible implementations, IGP and BGP, and link state as well as
   distance vector.  The fundamental impetus is the question raised in
   [RFC3704] and shim6 of exit routing, the question raised by Mike
   O'Dell of source/destination routing, and the "fish" problem, raised
   in many networks, in which distinct traffic classes that could
   conceivably use the same route predictably use different routes.
   Instead of handling these as "destination routing with a twist", the
   paper looks at the matter systemically.

1.1.  Scope

   The question of implementation of IPv4 or IPv6 routes is moot; the
   algorithms discussed here can be used for either.  Examples, however,
   will be drawn from IPv6 [RFC2460] and will presume its addressing
   architecture [RFC4291].

1.2.  Structure of the paper

   The paper looks first at the fundamental concept in Section 2.  It
   then goes on to imagine an IS-IS-like [RFC5308] [RFC6119]
   implementation.  Unfortunately, this really can't be implemented in
   IS-IS by adding a TLV, which is our usual approach, due to the
   changed concept of a metric.  However, given the changed concepts of
   a metric and a TLV, it shows how the same exchange and calculation
   algorithms can be used to build such a routing protocol.  It also
   looks at a RIP-like [RFC2080] algorithm that includes a sequence
   number (derived from AODV [RFC3561]) to simplify count-to-infinity-
   related problems.  It stops short of a BGP implementation, although
   one modeled on the distance vector model would make sense.


2.  The fundamental concept of routing a class

   This section introduces the fundamental concepts involved in routing
   a traffic class.  These include the definitions of

   o  a "traffic class", which is a set-theoretic definition - all
      traffic matching a constraint,

   o  a "metric", which is an administrative number applied to a class
      of traffic crossing an interface, and

   o  a "route announcement", which is the accumulation of information
      regarding the routing of a traffic class as modified by various
      metrics en route.

Internet-Draft           Routing a Traffic Class               July 2011


   In addition, it describes the fundamental algorithm applied in
   modifying a route announced by a predecessor node using a metric for
   announcement on the interface implied.

2.1.  Define: "traffic class"

   A "class" of traffic, in any routing protocol, is the selector that
   is used to identify a traffic stream for the purpose of routing.  For
   traditional internet routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP,
   or BGP, a "traffic class" is "the traffic destined to a stated
   prefix".  In the context of this design, a traffic class is the
   traffic that goes

   o  to a destination prefix, which may be a default route (::/0), a
      host route (any /128 prefix), or anything in between,

   o  from a source prefix, which may be a default route (::/0), a host
      route (any /128 prefix), or anything in between, and

   o  using one of a set of DSCP [RFC2474] values.

   The set of DSCP values includes and "any DSCP".  "Any DSCP" has the
   obvious meaning: we are not really looking at the DSCP in traffic
   classification.

   A protocol could also identify a route as a "null route"; this is
   like any other route, but specifically directs that traffic matching
   the traffic class is to be dropped.

   A traffic class is represented in this document as

      {destination, source, {list of DSCPs}|any|none}

   Examples of common traffic classes include:

   Standard Default Route:  {::/0, ::/0, any}

   Default Route using a source prefix  {::/0, source, any}

   Default route used only for a QoS Traffic Class:  {::/0, ::/0, {list
      of DSCPs}}

   Examples of QoS traffic classes are found in the Configuration
   Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes [RFC4594] and related
   documents [RFC5127] and [RFC5865].

2.2.  Define: "metric"

   A "metric" is an attribute of an interface, and associates a traffic
   class with a administrative value used in comparison of routes.  In
   this document, it is represented as

      {{destination, source, {DSCP}|any|none}, administrative value}

   and should be understood as "the metric for traffic from source to
   destination using DSCP".

   For example, if an interface is available to all VoIP traffic, one of
   the metrics on an interface might be

      {{::/0, ::/0, {EF}}, administrative value}

2.3.  Define: "route announcement"

   A route announcement is identical to a metric in structure, but is
   semantically different.  Where a metric is an attribute of an
   interface, a route is an entry in the route table calculated by the
   routing protocol, and is used in making forwarding decisions.

   The calculation of a route follows the following logic:

   1.  Inputs to the route calculation are a route announcement (which
       may be derived from an interface metric in the case of local
       routes, or received from a neighboring route for remote routes),
       and a metric associated with an interface.

   2.  The source, destination, and set of DSCPs of the route
       announcement and the metric are intersected to generate the
       traffic class for the resulting route.

   3.  The resulting route's administrative value is the sum of the
       original route's administrative value and the interface's
       administrative value.

   For example, in Figure 1, if the prefix allocated by ISP-1 to a
   network is 2001:db8:1::/48 and the prefix allocated by ISP-2 to the
   network is 2001:db8:2::/48, the exit routers for the network might
   advertise into the network the default routes

   o  {{2000::/3, 2001:db8:1::/48, any}, 1} ("unicast traffic using
      source addresses in 2001:db8:1::/48 for any application"), and

   o  {{::/0, 2001:db8:2::/48, any}, 2} ("all traffic using source
      addresses in 2001:db8:2::/48 for any application").

                    Figure 1: Simple multihomed network

   One edge case is the case in which a route intersected with the
   available metrics yields the null set.  In such a case, the resulting
   route cannot be used as no traffic matches it.

   If an interior distance vector router in the network receives

      {{2000::/3, 2001:db8:1::/48, any}, 1} and

      {{::/0, 2001:db8:2::/48, any}, 2}

   from its upstream router, and on a given interface has a metric

      {{::/0, ::/0, {EF}}, 5} ("any VoIP traffic"),

   it would validly infer the routes

      {{2000::/3, 2001:db8:1::/48, {EF}}, 6} ("unicast VoIP traffic
      using source addresses in 2001:db8:1::/48") and

      {{::/0, 2001:db8:2::/48, {EF}}, 7} ("all VoIP traffic using source
      addresses in 2001:db8:2::/48").

   It would install the routes it received into its own route table, and
   advertise the calculated routes to neighboring routers.

   Note that there is no question of a unicast RPF or other forms of
   Ingress Filtering [RFC2827] required in such a network.  If a host
   spoofs a source address in another routing domain and sends a
   datagram upstream, there is no route in the network "from" that
   routing domain, and the router has no idea what to do with it.  In

   such cases the router would silently drop the traffic (it might be
   nice to respond with an ICMP, but to whom?); it should of course
   maintain appropriate counters and/or logs.  Similarly, since traffic
   is routed according to both its source and destination addresses,
   traffic using a source address in 2001:db8:2::/48 would have no
   chance of existing to ISP-1.  It is still possible for traffic from
   outside to come in, however, as such routes would have a source
   prefix of ::/0 or 2000::/3.

2.4.  Route Precedence

   Precedence in selection of routes is based on intersection, and
   follows the rule "most specific first".  This is a generalization of
   the "longest match first" rule used in destination routing.  That may
   require, in generating the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) from the
   Routing Information Base (RIB), that we calculate the least
   intersection of two route announcements.

   In calculating routes, either one route's traffic class is a subset
   of another's, or they mutually incompatible.  If one is a subset of
   the other, we consider the superset to be "less specific" and the
   subset to be "more specific"; the most specific matching traffic
   class rules.  If the most specific option is in fact multiple traffic
   classes none of which are subsets of the others, we calculate the
   intersections of those routes for the purpose of comparison, and
   apply the rule to the resulting route announcements.

   For example, consider the two routes

      {{2000::/3, ::/0, any}, 1} and

      {{::/0, 2000::/3, any}, 5}.

   They are not comparable because neither is a subset of the other.  We
   therefore calculate the intersection, which is a choice between

      {{2000::/3, 2000::/3, any}, 1} and

      {{2000::/3, 2000::/3, any}, 5}.

   Given that choice, the metric clearly selects {{2000::/3, 2000::/3,
   any}, 1}.  So we install in the RIB the three routes

      {{2000::/3, 2000::/3, any}, 1},

      {{2000::/3, ::/0, any}, 1}, and

      {{::/0, 2000::/3, any}, 5}.

   The first is used by unicast traffic, as it is the most specific that
   matches traffic from and to addresses in 2000::/3.  The second is
   used, for example, with traffic that is from addresses whose most
   significant three bits are not 001 and to an address in 2000::/3.
   The third is used for traffic that is to addresses whose most
   significant three bits are not 001 but are from addresses in
   2000::/3.


3.  Sketch of a distance vector implementation

   A distance vector implementation would operate much as described in
   Section 2.  In addition, however, we might take advantage of an
   algorithm used in AODV [RFC3561]) to simplify count-to-infinity-
   related problems.

   To this end, we use the mechanisms and algorithms of [RFC2080] with
   certain modifications.

   A Route Table Entry (RTE), in this model, might be structured as in
   Figure 2.

   N: if 1, a null route; traffic in this traffic class and not in more
      explicit match SHOULD be dropped.

   flags:  unspecified in this version of the specification.  Set to 0
      on transmission and ignored on receipt.  Future versions may
      specify additional flags.

   Metric:  The Metric is as defined in [RFC2080].

   Announcement sequence number:  0..FFFFFFFF, follows the rules for a
      sequence number specified in [RFC3561].

   IPv6 originator address:  One of the global addresses of the router
      originating this RTE, presumably the one used on the relevant
      interface, which is in control of the sequence number.  See
      [RFC3561] for considerations and algorithms.

   Destination Prefix Length:  0..128

   Source Prefix Length:  0..128

   IPv6 destination prefix:  The significant bits of the prefix in
      question.  Occupies ceiling(destination prefix length/8) bytes.

   IPv6 source prefix:  The significant bits of the prefix in question.
      Occupies ceiling(source prefix length/8) bytes.

   IPv6 Traffic Class DSCP:  if A=0, not present; if A=0, the most
      significant bit is numbered 0, and indicates that the traffic
      class includes traffic with a DSCP of 000000; if A=1, not present.

   Distribution and calculation of routes follows [RFC2080], including
   split horizon (an announcement received from a router on the
   interface should not be reannounced to the same router). and poison
   reverse (which should be used on triggered updates but not regular
   announcements).

   Elimination of stale routing information of routes follows the
   algorithm with the sequence number specified in [RFC3561].

   Intersection of route announcements with interface metric data is as
   described in Section 2.


4.  Sketch of a link state implementation

   A link state (SPF) implementation would also operate much as
   described in Section 2, although the algorithm operates in memory as
   opposed to being distributed.

   To this end, we use the mechanisms and algorithms of [RFC5308] with
   certain modifications.

   IS-IS structures its network as a lattice of routers that lead one to
   sets of hosts identified by "TLVs".  A TLV, in this model, might be
   structured as in Figure 3.

   The fields are:

   U: up/down bit

   X: external original bit

   S: subtlv present bit

   A: If 1, any DSCP applies, and the IPv6 Traffic Class DSCP mask is
      absent.  If 0, the IPv6 Traffic Class DSCP is present.

   N: if 1, a null route; traffic in this traffic class and not in more
      explicit match SHOULD be dropped.

   flags:  unspecified in this version of the specification.  Set to 0
      on transmission and ignored on receipt.  Future versions may
      specify additional flags.

   Destination Prefix Length:  0..128

   Source Prefix Length:  0..128

   IPv6 destination prefix:  The significant bits of the prefix in
      question.  Occupies ceiling(destination prefix length/8) bytes.

   IPv6 source prefix:  The significant bits of the prefix in question.
      Occupies ceiling(source prefix length/8) bytes.

   IPv6 Traffic Class DSCP:  if A=0, not present; if A=0, the most
      significant bit is numbered 0, and indicates that the traffic
      class includes traffic with a DSCP of 000000; if A=1, not present.

   Distribution and calculation of routes follows [RFC5308].

   Intersection of route announcements with interface metric data is as
   described in Section 2.


5.  IANA Considerations

   At this point, this memo asks the IANA for no new parameters and
   gives the IANA no instructions.  As development progresses, that
   might change.


6.  Security Considerations

   Security issues in routing protocols such as these are the same as in
   other distance vector and link state routing protocols, and need to
   be mitigated in the same ways.  Since this paper looks primarily at
   the algorithms for route calculation, those issues are largely
   ignored.  If a protocol such as described in Section 3 or Section 4
   is implemented, however, care must be taken to ensure the integrity
   of communications between routers and their mutual authentication.
