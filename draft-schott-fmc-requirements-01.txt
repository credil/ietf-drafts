Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   June 2012


1.  Introduction


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Caution

   This document is a working tool to help assessing whether additional
   specification effort is required within IETF.  As such, it is not the
   intent of this document to become an RFC but be the privileged place
   to analyze claimed technical issues and their requirements.

   This document is not by any means voicing for creating a new working
   group.

   Technical items identified in the document are judged as potential
   items which may require conducting specifying effort within IETF.
   These items are relevant to particular use cases.  These use cases
   and associated requirements should be challenged by FMC List
   participants.

   Some of these technical items are already covered by some exiting
   IETF WGs.  This document may also be perceived as a motivation
   document to encourage advancing those items in the standardization
   process.


4.  Requirements on UE Identification

   A popular deployment model in fixed networks is to provide a host
   with a single private IPv4 address at the home LAN or small business
   LAN.  For instance, each host within the local network will be
   assigned a private IPv4 address, then NA(P)T function is responsible
   for translating the private IPv4 address to the public IPv4 address
   assigned to the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment).

   In addition, a CPE can be configured to offer a shared WiFi to
   visiting hosts (also called UEs (User Equipments)) which do not
   belong to the subscriber (owning the CPE).  A visiting UE uses that
   shared WiFi facility to access its services.  Granting access to the
   service is usually conditioned by an access control phase (e.g.,
   redirection to captive portal inviting the user to authenticate).
   Once access to the service is granted, the visiting UE can be



Durel, et al.           Expires December 14, 2012               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   June 2012


   delivered its services.

   Among various schemes to offer shared WiFi service, operators may
   decide to re-use the NAT function embedded in the CPE to route the
   traffic issued from the visiting UE.  It is out of scope of this
   document to argue in favor or against this deployment model but to
   describe an issue which must be solved whenever this model is
   adopted.

   Indeed, when the traffic of a visiting UE is multiplexed behind the
   same public IP address, upstream devices won't be able to distinguish
   the traffic issued from a visiting UE than the one issued by devices
   belonging to the subscriber owning the CPE.  This traffic
   identification is required to enforce dedicated policies (e.g.,
   Accounting, QoS policies, legal intercept, legal data storage, etc.).
   As a result, and in order for the operator to still support traffic
   management for this service, policy control/decision/enforcement MUST
   be based on a per-UE granularity: i.e., traffic belonging to a
   visiting UE MUST be explicitly identified.  The HOST_ID, introduced
   in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis], jointly with the external
   IP address are necessary to uniquely identify the traffic of a given
   visiting UE.

   An implementation example would be the use of port sets as HOST_ID.
   To illustrate this example, let's consider the CPE assigns a private
   IPv4 address and a set of ports to a visiting UE.  Then, the CPE
   reports the assigned port set to a service node together with other
   information such as external IPv4@, MAC@, etc.  This information will
   be correlated with the user_id provided during the authentication
   phase.  The CPE will use that port set for NAPTing packets from that
   visiting UE.  The set of ports (assigned by the CPE) and the external
   IP address (assigned to the CPE) are then sufficient to uniquely
   identify a UE.  The reporting phase can be avoided if the CPE is pre-
   configured with a static list of port sets to be used for visiting
   UEs.

   The use of port sets and other methods to explicitly identify a
   visiting UE are identified and discussed in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-
   reveal-analysis].  In order to ease the selection of the appropriate
   HOST_ID solution for the FMC case, below are listed a set of
   requirements to be met:

   o All traffic MUST be identified (including TCP, UDP and ICMP)

   o The UE SHOULD NOT be trusted to inject its own HOST_ID

   o The CPE SHOULD inject the HOST_ID

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   June 2012


   o The CPE SHOULD strip any exsiting HOST_ID

   o The CPE and the service node MUST support at least one common
   method to convey HOST_ID.

4.1.  Recommendations

   We recommend dedicated efforts to specify a mechanism to reveal
   HOST_ID in this specific use case.

   A solution analysis document would help.


5.  Requirements for Access Selection

   Multiple access environment requires clever choice of the access
   network (cellular, mobile, VPN,...). this selection should depend on
   different criteria such as user's preference, user profile, network
   capabilities and conditions, operator policies, application QoS
   requirements and so on.

5.1.  Recommendations

   Monitoring mechanisms MUST exist allowing the collection of QoS
   information for each access network type.The network status needs to
   be known through: knowing the available bandwidth for each type of
   available network and the cost of using each type of available
   network, QoS information for each access network type.

   Policies access selection SHOULD be possible.

   A mapping between the network status and the service requirements
   needs to exist to choose the network that best matches the service
   requirements.

   Management of user's access in the presence of several candidate
   access networks (fixed and mobile) needs to exist.


6.  Requirements on UE Mobility in Fixed Broadband Network

   The following are the requirements on UE Mobility in Fixed Broadband
   Network:
   o  The switch from one network to another MUST exist during the
      session according to the network status with the change in the UE
      attachment.

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   June 2012


   o  Mechanisms and interfaces between operators SHOULD be deployed to
      control the mobility of the traffic flows of their users.
   o  Mobility should be enabled even in AP overlapped area
   o  Differentiated Services for the mobile device or the Station (STA)
   o  Service guarantee when roaming or mobility
   o  Resiliency in the network nodes should be provided


7.  Requirements for Content Adaptation

   In this case, adaptation of content format (HD/SD, codec, .)  SHOULD
   be possible when delivering the same content (e.g. video streaming)
   regardless of the access network type and of the terminal (User
   Equipment 'UE") characteristics.

7.1.  Recommendations

   To be able to meet above high level requirement, the content
   adaptation function needs to:

   1. identify the user connection through identifying each UE in a
   separate manner.  The UE identity needs to be updated during the
   session each time a new terminal is used.  The characteristics of
   each UE being used needs to be known also (e.g. supported resolution,
   screen size, available network connectivity "WiFi, 3G, .." and the
   cost of using each type of available networks).

   2. distinguishing the UE and the CPE identification (MOTIVATION?).

   3. rely on service layer monitoring (for instance through MPEG2 layer
   monitor for video content) SHOULD exist to choose the network best
   matching the service requirements.


8.  Requirements for Streaming

   An additional case is the Personalization of Video Streaming Service.

8.1.  Personalization of Video Streaming Service

8.1.1.  Discussion

   The explosion of streaming services (across multiple screens,
   connected devices) triggers the need for video streaming service
   personalization and makes users looking for rich Quality of
   Experience (QoE).  The personalization of the video streaming service
   allows the video streaming content delivery in a customized manner
   considering each user, the used device and the network status through



Durel, et al.           Expires December 14, 2012               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   June 2012


   mainly:

   i) the choice of the delivery network (fixed or mobile),

   ii) the choice of the local access network at home (WiFi, Femto,
   ADSL, .),

   iii) the choice of the delivery mode (unicast, multicast, delivering
   content from the one server or from caches, ..)

   iv) the choice of the content format (HD/SD, codec, .).

   Consequently, the video streaming content can follow the user from
   terminal to terminal regardless of the access network type and of the
   terminal (User Equipment 'UE") characteristics.

   This requires on one hand technical solutions to allow the selection
   of the appropriate interface to be used by the UE.  As the UE would
   not have the whole image of the congestion status of the network (and
   also it would always privilege its own quality regardless of the cost
   of network use by the operator), these solutions need to be triggered
   by the network and/or the service domains and not at the UE side.
   The case of premium clients could be also considered that should have
   more QoS access (i.e. more bandwidth) and then the decision on the
   network choice needs to be decided by the operator.

   To be able to select the appropriate network and adapt the content
   according to the network status there is a need for knowledge (in a
   dynamic manner during the session) on the network status and its
   variation to be able to adapt the content in a dynamic manner also
   during the session (for example, a session that started with HD
   content could change to SD if the network conditions degrades).  On
   the other hand, there is a need for updating the content according to
   the UE capabilities.  The current adaptive streaming solutions (as
   the HAS: HTTP Adaptive Streaming) mainly count on the UE for
   selecting the suitable content.

   However, if this happens at the content source opposite to the HTTP
   adaptive streaming techniques currently existing, it would only send
   the appropriate content for each client and save network resources
   (for example, H.264/AVC video is encoded into 2 Mbps for SD and 6Mbps
   for HD).  A mapping between the network status and the service
   requirements is also needed, where the service requirements are
   mainly exhibited by the content source (owned by the Content provider
   or the service provider).  It could also be extracted from the
   content Metadata.

   To be able to realize such use-case, the following requirements need

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements                   June 2012


   to be met:
   o  Each user connection MUST be identified through identifying each
      UE in a separate manner and distinguishing the UE and the CPE
      identification.  The UE identification could be simply an NFC
      identifier, MAC identifier, ... associated with more information
      reflecting the UE characteristics.
   o  Monitoring mechanisms MUST exist allowing the collection of QoS
      information for each access network type.
   o  Service layer monitoring (for instance through MPEG2 layer monitor
      for video content) SHOULD exist to choose the network best
      matching the service requirements.
   o  The switch from one network to another MUST exist during the
      session according to the network status with the change in the UE
      attachment.
   o  Mechanisms and interfaces between operators SHOULD be deployed to
      control the mobility of the traffic flows of their users.

8.2.  Recommendations

   The IETF SHOULD dedicate efforts to consider several issues related
   to the UE and also to the network status as follows:

   1.  Each UE needs to be identified in a fine-grained manner and the
   UE identity needs to be updated during the session each time a new
   terminal is used.  The characteristics of each UE being used needs to
   be known also (e.g. supported resolution, screen size, available
   network connectivity "WiFi, 3G, .." and the cost of using each type
   of available networks).

   2.  The network status needs to be known through: knowing the
   available bandwidth for each type of available network and the cost
   of using each type of available network, QoS information for each
   access network type.

   3.  A mapping between the network status and the service requirements
   needs to exist to choose the network that best matches the service
   requirements.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document focuses on FMC requirements and the interworking of
   "WiFi, 3G, etc..." and should not rise to any new security
   vulnerabilities beyond those described in IPSec [RFC4301], TLS
   [RFC5246] or SRTP [RFC3711].  Nevertheless an open network
   architecture is described in this document probably causing new
   issues not foreseeable yet.
