               Requirements for Fixed Mobile Convergence
                    draft-schott-fmc-requirements-03

Abstract

   Fixed-mobile convergence encompasses a variety of use cases that
   include situations in which a wireless device travels between a point
   of attachment in a mobile network (such as a cellular base station)
   and another point of attachment anchored in a fixed network such as a
   WiFi hotspot.  Convergence then means enabling an end-user to access
   services or retrieve content whatever the network access conditions
   (e.g., fixed or mobile access infrastructure), and whether the end-
   user is in motion or not.  This document discusses the issues related
   to convergence and elaborates a set of requirements.

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements              September 2012


1.  Introduction

   With network heterogeneity and huge demand of multimedia and audio-
   visual services and applications as a given, users' satisfaction is
   the aim of each service provider to reduce churn, promote new
   services and improve the ARPU (Average Revenue per User).  The market
   is crowded.  Many players provide Internet and entertainment
   services, which motivates new business models considering users'
   experience and considering roaming agreement between different
   operators.  The new expectation for users' consumption style focuses
   on personalized and interactive usage.  This allows users on one hand
   to share content across many devices and with other users, but on the
   other hand to access all content seamlessly at the touch of a button.

   Consequently, Quality of Experience (QoE) has become a crucial
   determinant of the success or failure of the multimedia and audio-
   visual applications and services.  QoE evaluates the users' perceived
   quality for the provided services and hence reflects the users'
   satisfaction.  Regarding QoS, 3GPP has made architectural definitions
   as described in [TS23.203] and [TS29.212].  IETF has also described
   how QoS can be achieved over IP [RFC5865].

   Various meanings can be ascribed to the term Fixed-Mobile
   Convergence.  It is not the intention of this document to give a
   complete definition regarding business and technical aspects.  Fixed-
   mobile convergence has recently been used to include various use
   cases in which a wireless device travels between a point of
   attachment in a mobile network (such as a cellular base station) and
   another point of attachment anchored in a fixed network such as a
   WiFi hotspot. [samog]Convergence refers to a perceived unification of
   the service level available to applications which is, to the extent
   feasible, independent of the nature of the underlying physical
   medium.

   This document discusses issues raised by convergence and elaborates a
   set of requirements based on the problem statement and use cases as
   discussed in [I-D.xue-intarea-fmc-ps] and [I-D.sun-fmc-use-case].
   These use cases have been under discussion in BBF [WT203] and 3GPP
   [3GPP.22.278] respectively [3GPP.22.234].  The requirements discussed
   in this document are meant to help the IETF community to decide
   whether it should take part of the corresponding effort or not.


2.  Caution

   This document is a working tool to help assessing whether additional
   specification effort is required within IETF.  Technical issues
   mentioned in this document are those which may require carrying out a

   specification effort within IETF.

   The goal of this document to enable the analysis of technical issues
   and their requirements.  These issues are relevant to particular use
   cases.  The relevant use cases and associated requirements need
   thorough discussion.

   Some of these technical issues are already covered by some existing
   IETF WGs.  This document may provide motivation to advance such items
   in the standardization process.


3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as specified in [RFC2119].

   The following additional terms are used in this document.

   aggregation node
      The access network node which connects CPE and UE devices to the
      Internet.

   Codec
      Compression/Decompression of multimedia data using either a
      hardware device or software.

   CPE
      Customer Premises Equipment, that is equipment found in the
      customer's physical location and provided by the network operator
      or service providers.  DSL routers, Set-Top-Box (STB), and
      decoders are examples of CPE.

   FMC
      Fixed Mobile Convergence means enabling an end-user to access
      services or retrieve content whatever the network access
      conditions (e.g., fixed or mobile access infrastructure), and
      whether the end- user is in motion or not.  This includes also
      access conditions with this own service profile although having
      access by a 3rd party.

   host_id
      an identifier for the wireless device, as described in
      [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis].

      example of a host_id.  Each host under the same external IP
      address is assigned a restricted port set.  These port sets may
      then be advertised to remote servers.  Port sets assigned to hosts
      may be static or dynamic.

   SD
      Standard Definition for video using a standard resolution.

   HD
      High Definition for video using an enhanced resolution.


4.  Architecture Overview

   In practice multiple scenarios like non-roaming or roaming and access
   via trusted or untrusted WLAN access are possible.  To give a
   reference architecture we referring to [samog] and [ieee802.11].  The
   reference architecture describes how access to 3GPP via a GTP-based
   S2a and PMIP networks is possible.

   Requirements of the architecture are :

   REQ1:  Access to EPC resources/services with access control by the
          operator
   REQ2:  Seamless mobility between 3GPP and WLAN for EPS services with
          IP address preservation
   REQ3:  Non-seamless mobility services between 3GPP and WLAN for EPS
          services: no IP address preservation
   REQ4:  Support of UEs with single PDN connection; support of UEs with
          multiple PDN connections
   REQ5:  Access to EPC via WLAN simultaneously with non-seamless WLAN
          offload


   General requirements for FMC are common service and subscriber
   profiles.  Additionally common charging, operational and management
   procedures are also required.  Additional requirements for IP traffic

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements              September 2012


   offload are described in [TR23.829].  The benefit of using traffic
   offload is to save frequency range and to allow access in areas where
   cellular coverage is not available.

   For one, operators see a potential in simplifying their operational/
   user support complexity, as well as harmonizing network element
   functionality around the IP protocol.  Operators running multiple
   access networks also view IP service delivery as the key lowest
   common denominator towards delivering common services in a converged
   network.  The service provider community have shown significant
   interest in migrating from a pure PPP access environment towards one
   with IP subscriber sessions for delivery of all IP broadband services
   in fixed networks [WT146].  With LTE respectively EPC the mobile
   networks are also introducing a pure all IP mobile broadband access.

   Probably in the end everything is mobile.  One can also presume that
   everything is all IP having only agnostic access networks.  For
   operating those networks appropriate enough IP address space
   [RFC6264] and security features like Internet Key Exchange Protocol
   Version 2 [RFC5996] respectively [I-D.so-ipsecme-ikev2-cpext] are
   required.

   The following figure is a brief overview how fixed and mobile
   networks could interwork:

5.  Requirements for MN Identification behind a CPE with NAT

   A popular deployment model in fixed networks is to provide a host
   with a single private IPv4 address at the home or small business LAN.
   Then, each host within the local network will be assigned a private
   IPv4 address; a NA(P)T function [RFC2663] is responsible for
   translating the private IPv4 address to the public IPv4 address
   assigned to the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment).  Similar address
   translation features are also present now in mobile environment; as
   one example, CPE can be connected to mobile infrastructures.

   IP address sharing is motivated by a number of different factors.
   And today, some servers use the source IPv4 address as an identifier
   to treat some incoming connections differently.  Due to the use of
   NAT44 [RFC3022] and NAT64 [RFC6146]), that address will be shared.
   In particular, when a server receives packets from the same source
   address, because this address is shared, the server does not know
   which host is the sending host [RFC6269].  To be able to sort out the
   packets for each sending host, the server must have extra information
   in addition to the source IP address, to distinguish the sending
   host.  This identifying information is called the "host_id".

   As a general matter, the HOST_ID proposals do not seek to make hosts
   any more identifiable than they would be if they were using a public,
   non-shared IP address.  However, depending on the solution proposal,
   the addition of host_id information may allow a device to be
   fingerprinted more easily than it otherwise would be.  Should
   multiple solutions be combined that include different pieces of
   information in the host_id, fingerprinting may become even easier.

   A set of solution candidates to mitigate some of the issues
   encountered when address sharing is used have been described and
   compared in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis].  Among or aside
   this set of solutions, a mechanism will have to be recommended to
   supply host_id in the use cases described in Section 6 as well as in
   [I-D.xue-intarea-fmc-ps] and [I-D.sun-fmc-use-case].

   A CPE can also be configured to offer a shared WiFi to any visiting
   host (also called Mobile Node, or simply MN) which does not belong to
   the subscriber (owning the CPE).  A visiting MN uses that shared WiFi
   facility to access its services.  Granting access to the service is
   usually conditioned by an access control phase (e.g. redirection to
   captive portal inviting the user to authenticate).  Once access to
   the service is granted, the visiting MN can receive its services.
   Business model considerations for such service offerings are out of
   scope for this document.

   Among various ways to offer shared WiFi service, operators may elect



Durel, et al.            Expires March 25, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements              September 2012


   to re-use the NAT function embedded in the CPE to route the traffic
   issued from the visiting MN.

   When the traffic of a visiting MN is multiplexed behind the same
   public IP address, upstream devices may be unable to distinguish the
   the traffic of the visiting MN from other traffic issued by devices
   belonging to the subscriber owning the CPE.  This traffic
   identification may be required to enforce dedicated policies (e.g.,
   Accounting, QoS policies, legal intercept, legal data storage, etc.).
   As a result, and in order for the operator to still support traffic
   management for this service, policy control/decision/enforcement MUST
   be based on the specific MN.  In other words, traffic belonging to a
   visiting MN MUST be explicitly identified.  The host_id jointly with
   the external IP address can be used for this purpose.

   As one example, port sets can be used as a host-id.  To illustrate,
   suppose the CPE assigns a private IPv4 address and a set of ports to
   a visiting MN.  Then, the CPE can report the assigned port set to a
   aggregation node together with other information such as external
   IPv4 address, MAC address, etc.  This information will be associated
   with the user-id provided during the authentication phase.  The CPE
   then uses that port set for translating packets to and from that
   visiting MN.  The set of ports (assigned by the CPE) and the external
   IP address (assigned to the CPE) are then sufficient to uniquely
   identify a MN.  The reporting phase can be avoided if the CPE is pre-
   configured with a static list of port sets to be used for visiting
   MNs.

   The use of port sets and some other methods to explicitly identify a
   visiting MN is discussed in [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis],
   but many other methods of identification are also possible.  In order
   to ease the selection of the appropriate host-id solution for the FMC
   case, below are listed a set of requirements to be met:

   o  All traffic MUST be identifiable (including TCP, UDP and ICMP)
   o  The MN SHOULD be authenticated if it injects its own host-id
   o  Otherwise, the CPE SHOULD inject the host-id
   o  The CPE SHOULD strip any existing host-id
   o  The CPE and the aggregation node MUST support at least one common
      method to convey host-id.

5.1.  Recommendations for MN Identification behind NAT

   We recommend dedicated efforts to specify a mechanism to supply
   host-id for MNs behind CPE and NAT.

   A solution analysis document for existing solution approaches would
   help.

6.  Requirements for MN Mobility in Fixed Broadband Network

   The following are the requirements for MN Mobility in Fixed Broadband
   Network:
   o  Handover between networks while the session is active according to
      the network status with the change in the MN attachment.
   o  Mechanisms and interfaces between operators or/and access networks
      SHOULD be deployed to manage the mobility of the traffic flows of
      their users.
   o  Mobility should be enabled whether or not coverage areas overlap.
   o  Differentiated Services for the mobile device (MN)
   o  Service guarantee when device is roaming or mobile
   o  Resiliency in the network nodes should be provided


7.  Requirements for Link Characteristic Information

   Today the MN e.g. smart phones are reachable through multiple
   interfaces and have the possibility to use these interfaces
   simultaneously.  Thus roaming between different access technologies
   is required.  Due to the fact that wireless access link is most
   likely the bottleneck of end-to-end communication causing a
   significant portion of end-to-end delay delivery of link respectively
   sub-path characteristic information from one MN to the other can be
   used to optimise IP mobility performance by altering the end-to-end
   path properties.

   Unfortunately, existing IP mobility, transport and application layer
   protocols do not provide any facility to indicate which type of link
   the MN is currently attached to or what kind of changes there were on
   the local access link.  Local access link characteristic may also
   vary significantly as a result of handover between links on the same
   type (horizontal handovers)
   [I-D.korhonen-mobopts-link-characteristics-ps].


   Existing mobility protocols do not provide a mechanism to indicate
   which type of link the MN is currently attached to.  Therefore some
   new signalling mechanism is needed also avoiding the amount of
   signalling traffic load.


   The benefit of such signalling mechanism is to avoid complications to
   the IP transport and the service quality as many applications and
   congestion control mechanisms fail to respond fast enough if path
   characteristics change suddenly.

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements              September 2012


7.1.  Adaptive Application and Services

   Adaptive applications benefit from standardised mechanisms that
   notifies abrupt changes of link characteristics
   [I-D.korhonen-mobopts-link-characteristics-ps].  Streaming service
   e.g. for video or music can adapt to the new connection conditions.
   Assuming that a mobile device can connect to the network using
   various access technologies and moves from macro cellular access to
   802.11 WLAN an adaptive application could immediately scale the
   service in an appropriate manner.


7.2.  Network-Initiated Handover

   In a FMC scenario the MN desires to handover to another access
   network possibility based on the required service quality or other
   reasons like administrative policies.  With link characteristic
   information delivery mechanisms the network and the remote MN would
   have the knowledge to make these decisions.


7.3.  End-to-End path characteristics

   To deliver link characteristic information, the MN has to get its
   access link characteristic dynamically
   [I-D.korhonen-mobopts-link-characteristics-ps].  Providing of event
   classification, event reporting or event filtering corresponding to
   dynamic changes in the link characteristic enables the MN to manage
   and control link behaviour relevant handovers and mobility.  Initial
   measurement results on the end-to-end path characteristics can be
   used to inform upper layer congestion control mechanisms determining
   the effective end-to-end path characteristic.

7.4.  Requirements for Link and Sub-Path Information delivery

   The link characteristic information delivery mechanism SHOULD fulfil
   the following requirements.

   REQ1:  The link characteristic information delivery is independent of
          a certain IP mobility solution.
   REQ2:  The link characteristic information delivery SHOULD be
          applicable to existing mobility solutions.
   REQ3:  It is transport protocol independent.
   REQ4:  Signalling traffic load MUST be avoided.

   REQ5:  The mechanism MUST work when the MN is multi-homed or not.
   REQ6:  Link characteristic information SHOULD be exchanged prior to
          handover.
   REQ7:  Link characteristic information MUST be useable for remote
          peer node and/or remote network control entity.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document focuses on FMC requirements and the interworking of
   "WiFi, 3G, etc..." and should not give rise to any new security
   vulnerabilities beyond those described in IPSec [RFC4301], TLS
   [RFC5246] or SRTP [RFC3711].  Nevertheless an open network
   architecture aimed at fulfilling the requirements listed in this
   document may give rise to security issues not yet identified.


9.  IANA considerations

   None.

Internet-Draft              FMC Requirements              September 2012


Appendix A.  Requirements for Content Adaptation

   In this case, adaptation of content format (HD/SD, codec, ...)
   SHOULD be possible when delivering the same content (e.g. video
   streaming) regardless of the access network type and of the mobile
   node (MN) characteristics.

A.1.  Recommendations for Content Adaptation

   To be able to meet above high level requirement, the content
   adaptation function needs to:

   1.  identify the user connection by identifying each MN in a separate
       manner.  The MN identity MUST be updated during the session each
       time a new terminal is used.  The characteristics of each MN
       being used needs to be known also (e.g. supported resolution,
       screen size, available network connectivity "WiFi, 3G, .." and
       the cost of using each type of available network).
   2.  distinguishing the MN and the CPE identification (MOTIVATION?).
   3.  rely on service layer monitoring (for instance through MPEG2
       layer monitor for video content) SHOULD exist to choose the
       network best matching the service requirements.
