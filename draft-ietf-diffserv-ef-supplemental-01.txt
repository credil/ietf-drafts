This document was written during the process of clarification of
RFC 2598 "An Expedited Forwarding PHB" that led to the publication of
revised specification of EF "An Expedited Forwarding PHB".  Its
primary motivation is providing additional explanation to the revised
EF definition and its properties.  The document also provides
additional implementation examples and gives some guidance for
computation of the numerical parameters of the new definition for
several well known schedulers and router architectures.

This document is a product of the Differentiated Services Working
Group of the IETF.
