Abstract

   This document matches candidate protocols against the NVO3
   requirements.  Based on the results, gaps are identified and further
   protocol work is recommended.

Internet-Draft              NVO3 Gap Analysis              February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The charter of the NVO3 Working Group requires it to identify any
   gaps between the requirements it has identified and the available
   protocol solutions as a prerequisite to rechartering or concluding
   the Working Group if no gaps exist.  The present document is intended
   to provide the required analysis.  It provides a tabulation of the
   candidate protocols' ability to satisfy each requirement identified
   by the Working Group.  Areas where further work is required to ensure
   that the requirements are met are identified.

   Since the Working Group has yet to adopt documents describing
   requirements for the management and control planes, they are absent
   from the present version of this document.  The data plane
   requirements are taken from [I_D.dataplane_requirements].  The
   initial candidate protocols are NVGRE [I_D.NVGRE], VxLAN [I_D.VxLAN],
   L2VPN [reference?], and L3VPN [reference?].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Abbreviations

   This document uses the following abbreviations:

   NVO3:  Network virtualization overlays

   L2VPN  Layer 2 virtual private network

   L3VPN  Layer 3 virtual private network

   NVE:  Network virtualization edge

   VAP:  Virtual access point

   VNI:  Virtual network instance

   LAG:  Link aggregation group

   ECMP:  Equal cost multi-path

   DSCP:  Differentiated services code point
