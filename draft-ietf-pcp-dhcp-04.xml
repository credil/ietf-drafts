    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and
      DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> options which can be used to
      provision PCP Server <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref> names.</t>

      <t>In order to make use of these options, this document assumes
      appropriate name resolution means (e.g., Section 6.1.1 of <xref
      target="RFC1123"></xref>) are available on the host client.</t>

      <t>The use of DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment

    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document makes use of the following terms:<?rfc subcompact="yes" ?></t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>PCP Server denotes a functional element which receives and
          processes PCP requests from a PCP Client. A PCP Server can be
          co-located with or be separated from the function (e.g., NAT,
          Firewall) it controls. Refer to <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>.</t>

          <t>PCP Client denotes a PCP software instance responsible for
          issuing PCP requests to a PCP Server. Refer to <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DHCPv4 refers to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol <xref
          target="RFC2131"></xref> for IPv4.</t>

          <t>DHCP refers to both DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and
          DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DHCP client (or client) denotes a node that initiates requests to
          obtain configuration parameters from one or more DHCP servers.</t>

          <t>DHCP server (or server) refers to a node that responds to
          requests from DHCP clients.</t>

          <t>Name is a domain name that contains one or more labels. In
          particular, a PCP name may be structured as DNS qualified name or be
          composed of strings such as can be passed to getaddrinfo (Section
          6.1 of <xref target="RFC3493"></xref>), including address literals,
          etc.</t>
        </list><?rfc subcompact="no" ?></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Rationale">
      <t>Both IP Address and Name DHCP options have been considered in early
      stages of this specification. This flexibility aims to let service
      providers to make their own engineering choices and use the convenient
      option according to their deployment context. Nevertheless, DHC WG's
      position is this flexibility has some drawbacks such as inducing errors
      (See Section 7 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines"></xref>). Therefore, only the
      Name option is maintained within this document.</t>

      <t>This document defines an option to carry a name rather than an IP
      address. This choice is motivated by operational considerations: In
      particular, some Service Providers are considering two levels of
      redirection:</t>

      <t><?rfc subcompact="yes" ?><list style="format (%d)">
          <t>The first level is national-wise and undertaken by DHCP: a
          regional-specific Name will be returned;</t>

          <t>The second level is done during the resolution of the
          regional-specific Name to redirect the customer to a regional PCP
          server among a pool deployed regionally.</t>
        </list><?rfc subcompact="no" ?></t>

      <t></t>

      <t>Distinct operational teams are responsible for each of the above
      mentioned levels. A clear separation between the functional perimeter of
      each team is a sensitive task for the maintenance of the offered
      services. Regional teams will require to introduce new resources (e.g.,
      new PCP-controlled devices such as Carrier Grade NATs (CGNs, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements"></xref>)) to meet an increase
      of customer base. Operations related to the introduction of these new
      devices (e.g., addressing, redirection, etc.) are implemented locally.
      Having this regional separation provides flexibility to manage portions
      of network operated by dedicated teams. This two-level redirection can
      not be met by the IP Address option.</t>

      <t>In addition to the operational considerations:<?rfc subcompact="yes" ?><list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The use of the Name for NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>
          might be suitable for load-balancing purposes;</t>

          <t>For the DS-Lite case <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>, if the
          encapsulation mode is used to send PCP messages, an IP address may
          be used since the AFTR selection is already done via the AFTR_NAME
          DHCPv6 option <xref target="RFC6334"></xref>. Of course, this
          assumes that the PCP Server is co-located with the AFTR function. If
          these functions are not co-located, conveying the Name would be more
          convenient.</t>

    <section anchor="usename" title="Use of PCP Server Names">
      <t>This section specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP Client
      to contact its PCP Server(s) when receiving one or several PCP Names.
      This section is not specific to DHCP; it is applicable to any mechanism
      that configures server names.</t>

      <t>Multiple Names may be configured to a PCP Client in some deployment
      contexts such as multi-homing. It is out of scope of this document to
      enumerate all deployment scenarios which require multiple Names to be
      configured.</t>

      <section title="Name Resolution">
        <t>Each configured Name is passed to the name resolution library
        (e.g., Section 6.1.1 of <xref target="RFC1123"></xref> or <xref
        target="RFC6055"></xref>) to retrieve the corresponding IP address(es)
        (IPv4 or IPv6). Then, the PCP Client MUST follow the procedure
        specified in <xref target="selection"></xref> to contact its PCP
        Server(s).</t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED to associate a validity lifetime (e.g., TTL of
        DNS record if the Name is resolved using DNS) with any address
        resulting from resolving the PCP Server Name when stored in a local
        name resolution cache. Considerations on how to flush out a local
        cache are out of the scope of this document.</t>

        <t>A host may have multiple network interfaces (e.g, 3G, WiFi, etc.);
        each configured differently. Each PCP Server learned MUST be
        associated with the interface via which it was learned.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="selection" title="IP Address Selection">
        <t>This section specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP
        Client to contact its PCP Server(s) when receiving one or several PCP
        Names:</t>

        <t><?rfc subcompact="yes" ?></t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>If only one PCP Name is configured: if a list of IP addresses
            is returned as a result of resolving the PCP Server Name, the PCP
            Client follows the procedure specified in <xref
            target="series"></xref>.</t>

            <t>If several PCP Names are configured: each Name is treated as a
            separate PCP Server. Moreover, each Name may be resolved into one
            IP address or a list of IP addresses. The PCP Client contacts in
            parallel the first IP address of each Name and follows the
            procedure specified in <xref target="series"></xref> for the list
            of IP addresses returned for each Name. <xref
            target="examples"></xref> provides some examples to illustrate
            this procedure.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t><?rfc subcompact="no" ?></t>

        <t><!--Various use cases may be envisaged:
(1) Multiple PCP-controlled devices (e.g, IPv6 FW, NAT64 and NPTv6): these functions may be embedded in distinct devices: 
"Procedure 2" is to be followed. But still the question is how the PCP Client 
is aware about the capabilities of each PCP-controlled device and how to bound an IP address to a PCP function?
(2) Co-located model (e.g., FW and NATxy functions): one single IP address is needed; "Procedure 1" is to be followed.
(3) When several IP addresses pointing to the same function are retrieved: "Procedure 1" is to be followed.

* case: chain of PCP Servers: FW+NAT/NPT, two addresses may be used: capabilities of the PCP-controlled device
* Capabilities OPTION (see extension): to distinguish between these devices; how to associate capabilities/IP address

*** Do we need to indicate the capabilities in the DHCP option? See http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-boucadair-pcp-extensions-02#section-4

-->The discovery procedure may result in a PCP Client instantiating multiple
        mappings maintained by distinct PCP Servers. The decision to use all
        these mappings or delete some of them is deployment-specific. Only the
        client can decide whether all the mappings are needed or only a subset
        of them.</t>

        <section anchor="series" title="Serial Queries">
          <t>The PCP Client initializes its retransmission timer, RETRY_TIMER,
          to 2 seconds. The PCP Client sends its PCP message to the PCP Server
          and waits 2 seconds for a response. If no response is received, it
          doubles the value of RETRY_TIMER, sends another (identical) PCP
          message and waits 2*RETRY_TIMER. This procedure is repeated three
          (3) times, doubling the value of RETRY_TIMER each time. If no
          response is received after four (4) attempts, the PCP Client tries
          with the next IP address in its list of PCP Server addresses. If it
          has exhausted its list, the procedure is repeated every fifteen
          minutes until the PCP request is successfully answered. If, when
          sending PCP requests the PCP Client receives an ICMP error (e.g.,
          port unreachable, network unreachable) it SHOULD immediately try the
          next IP address in the list. Once the PCP Client has successfully
          received a response from a PCP Server address on that interface, it
          sends subsequent PCP requests to that same server address until that
          PCP Server becomes non-responsive, which causes the PCP client to
          attempt to re-iterate the procedure starting with the first PCP
          Server address on its list.</t>

    <section title="Dual-Stack Hosts">
      <t>In some deployment contexts, the PCP Server may be reachable with an
      IPv4 address but DHCPv6 is used to provision the PCP Client. In such
      scenarios, a plain IPv4 address or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address can be
      configured to reach the PCP Server.</t>

      <t>A Dual-Stack host may receive OPTION_PCP_SERVER via both DHCPv4 and
      DHCPv6. The content of these OPTION_PCP_SERVER options may refer to the
      same or distinct PCP Servers. This is deployment-specific and as such it
      is out of scope of this document.</t>
