Abstract

   The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited
   support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
   The current support only includes support for three Elliptic Curve
   groups, and there is fixed hash algorithm tied to each curve.  This
   document generalizes the IKEv2 signature support so it can support
   any signature method supported by the PKIX and also adds signature
   hash algorithm negotiation.  This generic mechanism is not limited to
   ECDSA, but can also be used with other signature algorithms.

Internet-Draft      Signature Authentication in IKEv2      December 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document adds support for new IKEv2 ([RFC5996]) authentication
   method to support all kinds of signature methods.  The current
   signature based authentication methods in the IKEv2 are per
   algorithm, i.e. there is one for RSA Digital signatures, one for DSS
   Digital Signatures (using SHA-1) and three for different ECDSA curves
   each tied to exactly one hash algorithm.  This design starts to be
   cumbersome when more ECDSA groups are added, as each of them would
   require new authentication method and as with ECDSA there is no way
   to extract the hash algorithm from the signature, each ECDSA
   algorithm would need to come with fixed hash algorithm tied to it.

   With the SHA-3 definitions coming out, it is seen that it might be
   possible that in the future the signature methods are used with SHA-3
   also, not only SHA-2.  This means new mechanism for negotiating the
   hash algorithm for the signature algorithms is needed.

   The RSA Digital Signatures format in the IKEv2 is specified to use
   RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, but there has been some discussions that newer
   padding methods should also be possible (See section 5 of [RFC4055]).
   The DSS Digital Signatures format in the IKEv2 is specified to always
   use SHA-1, which limits the security of that, meaning there is no
   point of using long keys with it.

   This documents specifies two things, one is one new authentication
   method, which includes the enough information inside the
   Authentication payload data that the signature hash algorithm can be
   extracted from there (see Section 3).  The another thing is to add
   indication of supported signature hash algorithms by the peer (see
   Section 4).  This allows peer to know which hash algorithms are
   supported by the other end and use one of them (provided one is
   allowed by policy).  There is no need to actually negotiate one
   common hash algorithm, as different hash algorithms can be used in
   different directions if needed.

   The new digital signature method needs to be flexible enough to
   include all current signature methods (ECDSA, ECGDSA, RSASSA-PSS,
   ElGamal, etc), and also allow adding new things in the future.  For
   this the signature algorithm is specified by and OID which specifies
   both the signature and hash algorithms (i.e. sha1WithRSAEncryption,
   dsa-with-sha1, dsa-with-sha256, ecdsa-with-SHA1, ecdsa-with-SHA256
   etc), meaning any signature and hash algorithm specified by an OID
   can be used.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Authentication Payload

   This document specifies new "Digital Signature" authentication
   method.  This method can be used with any types of signatures.  As
   the authentication methods are not negotiated in the IKEv2, the peer
   is only allowed to use this authentication method if the
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS Notify Payload has been sent and received.

   In this newly defined authentication method, the Authentication Data
   field inside the Authentication Payload does not include only the
   signature value, but instead the signature value is prefixed with the
   algorithm identification OID.  This OID identifies both the signature
   algorithm and the hash used when calculating the signature.  To make
   implementations easier, the OID is prefixed by the 8-bit length
   field.  This length field allows simple implementations to be able to
   know the length of the OID, so they can use it as binary blob which
   is compared against the known OIDs, i.e. they do not need to be able
   to parse or generate ASN.1 DER OIDs (Note, that the 2nd byte of the
   ASN.1 DER OID, also includes the length, but adding it outside makes
   things bit easier for implementors).

   The OIDs used here are the same OIDs which are used inside the
   AlgorithmIdentifier of the PKIX (Section 4.1.1.2 of [RFC5280]), but
   only the algorithm OID is included, no parameters etc.  The EC curve
   is always known by the peer because it needs to have the certificate
   or the public key of the other end before it can do signature
   verification and public key specifies the curve.

      XXX While reading RFC4055, it seemed that the OID is not enough to
      specify the hash function used for the RSASSA-PSS, i.e. it seems
      that we would need to include full AlgorithmIdentifier ASN object,
      as it includes also the parameters, and the hash function is
      specified in the parameters.  Is my reading of RFC4055 correct?
      XXX

   The Authentication payload is defined in IKEv2 as follows:

      Where the OID Length is the length of the ASN.1 encoded OID value,
      and after that is the actual Signature Algorithm OID followed by
      the actual signature value.  There is no padding between OID and
      signature value.  ASN.1 encoded OIDs always start with byte of
      0x06 followed by the length of the actual OID value (which is
      shown in the figure above).  For the hash truncation the method of
      X9.62, SEC1 and IO 14888-3 MUST be used.  XXX Need reference for
      X9.62/SEC1 etchere XXX.


4.  Hash Algorithm Notification

   The supported hash algorithms that can be used for the signature
   algorithms are now indicated with new SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS
   Notification Payload sent inside the IKE_SA_INIT exchange.  This
   notification also indicates the support of the new signature
   algorithm method, i.e sending this notification tells that new
   "Digital Signature" authentication method is supported and that
   following hash functions are supported by sending peer.  Both ends
   sends their list of supported hash-algorithms and when calculating
   signature a peer MUST pick one algorithm sent by the other peer.
   Note, that different algorithms can be used in different directions.
   The algorithm OID matching selected hash algorithm (and signature
   algorithm) used when calculating the signature is sent inside the
   Authentication Data field of the Authentication Payload.

5.  Security Considerations

      XXX The text about the guidance how to select suitable hash
      functions is missing here.  XXX

   This new digital signature method does not tie the EC curve to the
   specific hash function, which was done in the old IKEv2 ECDSA
   methods.  This means it is possible to use 512-bit EC curve with
   SHA1, i.e. this allows mixing different security levels.  This means
   that the security of the authentication method is the security of the
   weakest of components (signature algorithm, hash algorithm, curve).
   This might make the security analysis of the system bit more complex.
   Note, that this kind of mixing of the security can be disallowed by
   the policy.

   The hash algorithm registry does not include MD5 as supported hash
   algorithm, as it is not considered safe enough for signature use.

      XXX Need reference for MD5 considered unsafe.  XXX

   The current IKEv2 uses RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, and does not allow using
   newer padding methods like RSASSA-PSS.  This new method allows using
   other padding methods.

      XXX Need reference for RSASSA-PSS vs RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 security.
      XXX

   The current IKEv2 only allows using normal DSA with SHA-1, which
   means the security of the regular DSA is limited to the security of
   SHA-1.  This new methods allows using longer keys and longer hashes
   with DSA.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates new IANA registry for IKEv2 Hash Algorithms.
   Changes and additions to this registry is by expert review.

   The initial values of this registry is:

   Hash Algorithm                       Value
   --------------                       -----

   SHA2-256                             2
   SHA2-384                             3
   SHA2-512                             4

   MD5 is not included to the hash algorithm list as it is not
   considered safe enough for signature hash uses.

   Values 5-1023 are reserved to IANA.  Values 1024-65535 are for
