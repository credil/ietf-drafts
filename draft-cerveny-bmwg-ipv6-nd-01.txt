1.  Introduction

   This document is a benchmarking instantiation of RFC 6583:
   "Operational Neighbor Discovery Problems" [RFC6583].  It describes a
   general testing procedure and measurements that can be performed to
   evaluate how the problems described in RFC 6583 may impact the
   functionality or performance of intermediate nodes.

2.  Terminology

   Intermediate Node  An intermediate node can be a router, switch,
      firewall or any other device which separates end-nodes.  The tests
      in this document can be completed with any intermediate node which
      maintains a list of addresses that traverse the intermediate node,
      although not all measurements and performance characteristics may
      apply.  While it is likely that the intermediate node which will
      be the DUT will be at the edge of a network directly adjacent to
      an end-node, there may be reasons to test intermediate nodes
      closer to the center of the network path.

   Neighbor Discovery  See Section 1 of RFC 4861 [RFC4861]

   NDP Triggering Event  An event which forces the DUT (Device Under
      Test) to perform a neighbor solicitation.  A triggering event
      could be an ICMPv6 echo request, but could also be any other
      packets which require discovering the MAC address of existing and
      non-existing nodes on an IPv6 subnet.  A concern with using ICMPv6
      echo requests as triggering events is that some immediate nodes
      deprioritize functions involving ICMPv6 echo requests.

   Scanner Network  The network from which the scanning device is
      connected.

   Target Network  The network for which the scanning tests is targeted.

   Scanning Interface  The node which is conducting the scanning
      activity.

   Target Network Measurement Interface  A node that resides on the
      target network, which is primarily used to measure DUT performance
      while the scanning activity is occurring.

   Non-participating Network  Network connected to DUT, for which nodes
      are neither activie participants nor being directly impacted by
      the test traffic.

3.  Test Setup

   The test network design is fairly simple.  The network needs to
   minimally have two subnets: one from which the scanner(s) source
   their scanning activity and the other which is the target network of
   the address scans.

   It is assumed that the latency for all network segments is neglible.

   At least one node should reside on the target network to confirm some
   of the performance characteristics.

   Basic format of test network.  Note that optional "non-participating
   network" is a third network not related to the scanner or target
   network.

4.  Measurements

   Throughout measurements, two testing interfaces are defined:

   tester#1-new: Sets up new addresses

   tester#2-renew: Discovers addresses previously discovered

4.1.  Maximum number of hosts

   This test evaluates how many hosts can be on a network and still have
   connectivity between all endpoints.

   Perform "scan" with addresses in ascending order.

   tester#1-new sets up new addresses

   tester#2-renew is pinging existing addresses, where granularity is
   somewhere between a millisecond and a second.

   tester#1-new and tester#2-renew should get responses to every packet

4.2.  Stable-state time

   Given that there are as many hosts as determined in "maximum number
   of hosts" test, determine how long it takes for the neighbor cache
   get into a reasonable state.

   o  Lowest timer value and still have connectivity between all
      endpoints.

   o  Make sure tester can keep up

Internet-Draft        draft-cerveny-bmwg-ipv6-nd-00       September 2013


   o  Keep getting smaller intervals

   reduce timer on tester#1-new

   tester#1-new should not always get responses tester#2-renew should
   get responses to every packet

4.3.  NDP Prioritization

   How do we behave when we're being scanned.  Priority should be given
   to hosts that have been seen before.

   Slow down tester#2-renew until one gets into refreshing every 6
   seconds.  If an address is in the "stale" state, it should get
   priority over new request.

   increase timer on tester#2-renew.

   tester#2-renew should always get responses

   tester#1-new should not always get responses.

5.  Measurements Explicitly Excluded

   These are measurements which while possible, aren't being made
   because of the itemized reasons below:

5.1.  DUT CPU Utilization

   This measurement relies on the DUT to provide utilization
   information, which is subjective.

5.2.  Malformed Packets

   This benchmarking test is not intended to test DUT behavior in the
   presence of malformed packets, such as packets which do not confirm
   to designs consistent with IETF standards.

6.  DUT initialization

   At the beginning of each test, the neighbor cache of the DUT should
   be initialized

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

8.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.  Special
   capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.

   Any implications for network security arising from the DUT/SUT SHOULD
   be identical in the lab and in production networks.
