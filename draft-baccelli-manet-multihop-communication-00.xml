	This document describes some characteristics
	of communication between nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless network. These are not requirements in the
	sense usually understood as applying to formulation of
	a requirements document.
	Nevertheless, protocol engineers and system analysts
	involved with designing solutions for ad hoc networks
	must maintain awareness of these characteristics.

<section anchor='introduction' title='Introduction'>

<t>
	The goal of this document is to
	describe some aspects of multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	communication. Experience gathered with 
	<xref target="RFC3626"/> <xref target="RFC3561"/>
	<xref target="RFC3684"/> <xref target="RFC4728"/>
	<xref target="RFC5449"/> <xref target="RFC2501"/>
	<xref target="DoD01"/> shows that this type of
	communication presents specific challenges. This
	document briefly describes these challenges, which one
	should maintain awareness of, when designing Internet
	protocols for ad hoc networks.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor='manets' title='Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Networks'>

<t>
	For the purposes of this document, a multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	network will be considered to be a collection of devices
	that each have a radio transceiver, that are using the same
	physical and medium access protocols, that are moreover configured
	to self-organize and provide store-and-forward functionality
	on top of these protocols as needed to enable communications.
	The devices providing network connectivity are considered to
	be routers.  Other non-routing wireless devices, if present
	in the ad hoc network, are considered to be "end-hosts".
	The considerations in this document apply equally to routers
	or end-hosts; we use the term "node" to refer to any such
	network device in the ad hoc network.
</t>

<t>
	An example of multi-hop ad hoc wireless network is a wireless
	community network such as Funkfeuer <xref target="FUNKFEUER"/>
	or Freifunk <xref target="FREIFUNK"/>, that consists in routers
	running OLSR <xref target="RFC3626"/> on 802.11 in ad hoc mode
	with the same ESSID at link layer.  Multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	networks may also run on link layers other than 802.11.
</t>

<t>
	Note however that simple hosts communicating through an access
	point with 802.11 in infrastructure mode do not form a multi-hop
	ad hoc wireless network, since the central role of the access point
	is determined a priori, and since nodes other than the access point
	do not generally provide store-and-forward functionality.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="links"
	title="Common Packet Transmission Characteristics in
		Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Networks">
	
<t>	
	Let A and B be two nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network N. 
	Suppose that, when node A transmits a packet through its 
	interface on network N, that packet is correctly received
	by node B without requiring storage and/or forwarding by
	any other device. We will then say that B "hears" packets from A.
	Note that therefore, when B can hear IP packets from A, the TTL of
	the IP packet heard by B will be precisely the same as it
	was when A transmitted that packet.
</t>

<t>
	Let S be the set of nodes that can hear packets transmitted 
	by node A through its interface on network N. The following
	section gathers common characteristics concerning packet
	transmission over such networks, which were observed through
	experience with
	<xref target="RFC3626"/> <xref target="RFC3561"/>
	<xref target="RFC3684"/> <xref target="RFC4728"/>
	<xref target="RFC5449"/>.
</t>


<section anchor="graphs"
	title="Asymmetry, Time-Variation, and Non-Transitivity">

<t>
	First, there is no guarantee that a node C within S can,
	symmetrically, send IP packets directly to node A. In other
	words, even though C can "hear" packets from A (since it is
	a member of set S), there is no guarantee that A can "hear"
	packets from C.  Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications
	may be "asymmetric".  Such cases are not uncommon.
</t>


<t>
	Second, there is no guarantee that, as a set, S is at all stable, i.e.
	the membership of set S may in fact change at any rate, at any time.
	Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications may be "time-variant".
	Such variations are not unusual in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks
	due to variability of the wireless medium, and to node mobility.
</t>

<t>
	Now, conversely, let V be the set of nodes from which A can
	directly receive packets -- in other words, A can "hear" packets
	from any node in set V.  Suppose that node A is
	communicating at time t0 through its interface on network N.
	As a consequence of time variation and asymmetry,
	we observe that A:
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">

<t>
	cannot assume that S = V,
</t>

<t>
	cannot assume that S and/or V are unchanged at time t1 later than t0.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
	Furthermore, transitivity is not guaranteed over multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless networks. Indeed, let's assume that, through their
	respective interfaces within network N:
</t>

<t>
<list style="numbers">

<t>
	node B and node A can hear each other (i.e. node B is a member of
	sets S and V), and,
</t>

<t>
	node A and node C can also hear each other (i.e. node C is a
	also a member of sets S and V).
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>	
	These assumptions do not imply that node B can hear node C, nor that
	node C can hear node B (through their interface on network N).
	Such "non-transitivity" is not uncommon on multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless networks.
</t>

<t>
	In a nutshell: multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications can be
	asymmetric, non-transitive, and time-varying.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="reality"
	title="Radio Range and Wireless Irregularities">

<t>
	<xref target="graphs"/> presents an abstract description of some
	common characteristics concerning packet transmission over multi-hop
	ad hoc wireless networks.  This section describes practical examples,
	which illustrate the characteristics listed in <xref target="graphs"/>
	as well as other common effects.
</t>

<t>
	Wireless communication links are subject to limitations to the
	distance across which they may be established. The range-limitation
	factor creates specific problems on multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	networks. In this context, it is not uncommon that the radio ranges
	of several nodes partially overlap. Such partial overlap causes
	communication to be non-transitive and/or asymmetric, as described
	in <xref target="graphs"/>.
</t>	

<t>
	For example, as depicted in Figure 1, it may happen that a node
	B hears a node A which transmits at high power, whereas B transmits
	at lower power. In such cases, B can hear A, but A cannot hear B.
	This examplifies the asymmetry in multi-hop ad hoc wireless
	communications as defined in <xref target="graphs"/>.
</t>

	 node B, but B cannot communicate with A.

</figure>
</t>	

<t>	
	Another example, depicted in Figure 2, is known as the "hidden node"
	problem.  Even though the nodes all have equal power for their radio
	transmissions, they cannot all reach one another.  In the figure,
	nodes A and B can hear each other, and A and C can also hear each
	other.  On the other hand, nodes B and C cannot hear each other.  When
	nodes B and C try to communicate with node A at the same time, their
	radio signals collide.  Node A will only be able to detect noise, and
	may even be unable to determine the source of the noise.  The hidden
	terminal problem illustrates the property of non-transitivity in
	multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications as described
	in <xref target="graphs"/>.

<t><vspace blankLines="6"/></t>

<t>
	Another situation, shown in Figure 3, is known as the
	"exposed node" problem. In the figure, node A is transmitting
	(to node B). As shown, node C cannot communicate properly with
	node D, because of the on-going transmission of node A, polluting
	C's radio-range.  Node C cannot hear D, but node D can
	hear C because D is outside A's radio range.
	Node C is then called an "exposed node", because it is exposed to
	co-channel interference from node A and thereby prevented from
	exchanging protocol messages to enable transmitting data to node D
	-- even though the transmission would be successful and would not
	interfere with the reception of data sent from node A to node B.

</figure>
</t>

<t>
	Hidden and exposed node situations are not uncommon
	in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks. Problems with asymmetric
	links may also arise for reasons other than power inequality
	(e.g., multipath interference).
	Such problems are often resolved by specific mechanisms below the
	IP layer.
	However, depending the link layer technology in use and the
	position of the nodes, such problems due to
	range-limitation and partial overlap may affect the IP layer.
</t>



<t>
	Besides radio range limitations, wireless communications are
	affected by irregularities in the shape of the geographical area
	over which nodes may effectively communicate (see for instance
	<xref target="MC03"/>, <xref target="MI03"/>).
	For example, even omnidirectional wireless transmission is
	typically non-isotropic (i.e. non-circular).
	Signal strength often suffers frequent and significant variations,
	which are not a simple function of distance.  Instead, it is a
	complex function of the environment
	including obstacles, weather conditions, interference, and
	other factors that change over time.  The analytical
	formulation of such variation is often considered intractable.
</t>

<t>
	These irregularities also cause communications on multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless networks to be non-transitive, asymmetric, or time-varying,
	as described in <xref target="graphs"/>, and may impact the IP layer.
	There may be no indication to IP when a previously established
	communication channel becomes unusable; "link down" triggers
	are generally absent in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks. 
</t>

<section anchor="moreterms" title="Alternative Terminology">

<t>
	Many terms have been used in the past to describe the relationship of 
	nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network based on their ability
	to send or receive packets to/from each other.  The terms used in
	this document have been selected because the authors believe (or at
	least hope) they are unambiguous, with respect to the
	goal of this document (see <xref target="introduction"/>).
</t>	
<t>
	Nevertheless, here are a few other terms that describe the same
	relationship between nodes in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.
	In the following, let network N be, again, a multi-hop ad hoc
	wireless network.  Let the set S be, as before, the set of 
	nodes that can directly receive packets transmitted by node A
	through its interface on network N. In other words, any node B
	belonging to S can "hear" packets transmitted by A. Then,
	due to the asymmetry characteristic of wireless links:
</t>


<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t>
	- We may say that node B is reachable from node A. In this
	terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is reachable from
	node B, even if node B is reachable from node A.
</t>

<t>
	- We may say that node A has a link to node B. In this terminology,
	there is no guarantee that node B has a link to node A, even if
	node A has a link to node B.
</t>

<t>
	- We may say that node B is adjacent to node A. In this terminology,
	there is no guarantee that node A is adjacent to node B, even
	if node B is adjacent to node A.
</t>


<t>
	- We may say that node B is downstream from node A. In this
	terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is downstream from
	node B, even if node B is downstream from node A.
</t>

<t>
	- We may say that node B is a neighbor of node A. In this
	terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is a neighbor
	of node B, even if node B a neighbor of node A.  As it happens,
	the terminology for "neighborhood" is quite confusing for
	asymmetric links.  When B can hear signals from A, but A
	cannot hear B, it is not clear whether B should be considered
	a neighbor of A at all, since A would not necessarily be
	aware that B was a neighbor.  Perhaps it is best to avoid
	the "neighbor" terminology except for symmetric links.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
	This list of alternative terminologies is given here for illustrative
	purposes only, and is not suggested to be complete or even
	representative of the breadth of terminologies that have been
	used in various ways to explain the properties mentioned in
	<xref target="links"/>.
