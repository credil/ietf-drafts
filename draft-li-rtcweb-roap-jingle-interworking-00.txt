              draft-li-rtcweb-roap-jingle-interworking-00

Abstract

   This document proposes behavior of a RTCWeb signaling gateway for
   mapping message representations between RTCWeb Offer/Answer Protocol
   (ROAP) scheme and XMPP/Jingle messaging scheme.  Such a signaling
   gateway is intended to translate ROAP to/from XMPP/Jingle [XEP-0166]
   for enabling use cases between a RTCWeb enabled browser and legacy
   mobile devices which use XMPP/Jingle for signalling.

1.  Introduction

   This specification suggests one possible way to build a RTCWeb
   signaling gateway that maps message representations proposed in
   [ROAP] to native XMPP/Jingle messages and vice-versa.  The
   specification [ROAP] describes a signaling protocol for RTCWeb to
   support negotiation of media session using SDP offer/answer [RFC3264]
   protocol.  Such a signaling protocol enables an RTCWeb browser to
   setup media sessions to another browser or a XMPP/Jingle device.  For
   Browser-to-XMPP/Jingle device use case, the signaling gateway
   connects to legacy XMPP/Jingle devices and SHALL translate messages
   between ROAP and XMPP/Jingle native messages schemes.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Overview of Interworking Functionality

   When the signalling gateway receives ROAP call signaling messages
   from a Browser/Javascript, it performs the necessary translation and
   sends the corresponding equivalent messages to XMPP/Jingle entity and
   vice versa.  The signalling gateway SHALL provide signaling
   translation for all phases of a call.

   This signalling gateway does not include media format conversion.
   However, it MAY include a Media Switching Function for switching RTP
   packets which is out of scope of this document.

   The figure below shows the overall interworking architecture.

4.  Mapping to XMPP/Jingle

   Here is the mapping table to convert between XMPP/Jingle messages and
   ROAP parameters:


           ROAP Parameter             XMPP/Jingle Message
           ------------               -------------
           messageType                action
                 OFFER                    'session-initiate'
                ANSWER                        'session-info'
                                            'transport-info'
                                            'session-accept'
                    OK                      'session-accept'
                 ERROR                type='error'
           offererSessionId           sid
           answererSessionId          sid
           morecoming                 action='session-info'
           Seq                        ?

   Note that the media negotiation also needs to be done between XMPP/
   Jingle and SDP, please refer to [XEP-0167].

5.  Message Flows

   The design requires the signalling gateway to be XMPP/Jingle
   transaction statefull but does not require any storage of longer term
   state.  The information that remains constant over the XMPP/Jingle
   dialog is stored in session tokens while the information that is
   needed to form a XMPP/Jingle response is stored in response tokens.
   Messages on the two sides of the signalling gateway are referred to
   as the XMPP/Jingle device side and web side.

   The following sub-sections show example message flows with detailed
   message description of native XMPP/Jingle messages that are mapped
   from ROAP scheme and the ones that are received as responses by the
   signaling gateway.  CallerUA(callerua@atlanta.example.com) is a
   RTCWeb browser.  It is assumed that XMPP/Jingle device has registered
   with the signalling gateway to be able to receive the calls.

   In the example below, CallerUA establishes successful media session
   with CalleeUA, a legacy XMPP/Jingle device, with the help of the
   RTCWeb signaling gateway.

          |         "type":"OK"          |                       |
          |----------------------------->|                       |
          |                                                      |

   ROAP message and parameters.  Calling from CallerUA will contain the
   media channel information for forward and reverse channels.  This
   will help in mapping the complete channel information from ROAP
   "OFFER" + SDP to XMPP/Jingle session initiation message.  Similarly,
   session information from XMPP/Jingle side can be mapped to ROAP
   "ANSWER" response plus SDP information.  This message flow will give
   the immediate availability of media channels from both sides after
   XMPP/Jingle session-accept message and ROAP "OK" message.

   The details of call flow messages are shown as below.
