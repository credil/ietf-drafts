1.  Introduction

   TURN server plays a vital and is a building block to support direct,
   interactive, real-time communication using audio, video,
   collaboration, games, etc., between two peers web-browsers in Web
   Real-Time communication (WebRTC) [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview]
   framework.  The use-case explained in Section 4.2.4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements] refers to deploying a
   TURN[RFC5766] server to audit all media sessions from inside an
   Enterprise premises to any external peer.  TURN server could also be
   deployed for recording, RTP Mobility [I-D.wing-mmusic-ice-mobility]
   etc.

   TURN server is also used in the following scenarios :

   o  Users of RTCWEB based web application may choose to use TURN so as
      to not expose the host candidate addresses to the remote peer for
      privacy.

   o  Enterprise networks deploy firewalls typically configured to block
      UDP traffic.  When SIP user agents or WebRTC endpoints are
      deployed behind such firewalls, media cannot be sent over UDP
      across the firewall, but must be sent using TCP (which causes a
      different user experience).  In such cases a TURN server deployed
      in the DMZ MAY be used to traverse Firewalls.

   o  IPv6 support in TURN includes IPv4-to-IPv6, IPv6-to-IPv6, and IPv6
      -to-IPv4 relaying[RFC6156].

   o  ICE connectivity checks using server-reflexive candidates could
      fail because endpoint is behind NAT that performs Address-
      dependent mapping and relayed candidate allocated from the TURN
      server gets selected for media.

Internet-Draft Problems with STUN Authentication for TURN       May 2013


   STUN [RFC5389] specifies an authentication mechanism called the long-
   term credential mechanism.  TURN servers and clients are required to
   implement this mechanism.  The server requires that all requests from
   the client be authenticated using this mechanism, or that a equally
   strong or stronger mechanism for client authentication be used.

   In the above scenarios RTCWEB based web applications would use
   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol [RFC5245] for
   gathering candidates.  ICE agent can use TURN to learn server-
   reflexive and relayed candidates.  If the TURN server requires the
   TURN request to be authenticated then ICE agent will use the long-
   term credential mechanism explained in section 10 of [RFC5389] for
   authentication and message integrity.  TURN specification [RFC5766]
   in section 10 explains the importance of long-term credential
   mechanism to mitigate various attacks.  With proposals
   like[I-D.thomson-mmusic-rtcweb-bw-consent] that defines a STUN
   BANDWIDTH attribute for requesting bandwidth allocation at a TURN
   server, STUN authentication becomes further important to prevent un-
   authorized users from accessing the TURN server.

   This note focuses on listing the problems with current STUN
   authentication for TURN so that it can serve as the basis for
   stronger authentication mechanisms.

   Compared to a Binding request the Allocate request is more likely to
   be identified by a server administrator as needing auth protection.
   Hence, the issues discussed here in STUN authentication are
   applicable mainly in the context of TURN messages.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This note uses terminology defined in [RFC5389], [RFC5766].

3.  Scope

   This document can be used as a tool to design solution(s) to address
   the problems with the current STUN authentication for TURN messages.

4.  Problems with STUN Authentication

   1.  The long-term credential mechanism in [RFC5389] could use
       traditional "log-in" username and password given to users which
       does not change for extended periods of time and uses the key
       derived from user credentials to generate message integrity for

       every TURN request/response.  An attacker that is capable of
       eavesdropping on a message exchange between a client and server
       can determine the password by trying a number of candidate
       passwords and checking if one of them is correct by calculating
       the message-integrity of the message using these candidate
       passwords and comparing with the message integrity value in the
       MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute.  The long-term credential mechanism
       in [RFC5389] is also susceptible to offline dictionary attacks.
       This attack can be mitigated by using strong passwords with large
       entropy.

   2.  When TURN server is deployed in DMZ and requires requests to be
       authenticated using the long-term credential mechanism in
       [RFC5389], TURN server needs to be aware of the username and
       password to validate the message integrity of the requests and to
       provide message integrity for responses.  Thus requiring
       management overhead to maintain credential database on the TURN
       server.

   3.  The long-term credential mechanism in [RFC5389] requires that the
       TURN client must include username value in the USERNAME STUN
       attribute.  An adversary snooping the TURN messages between the
       TURN client and server can identify the users involved in the
       call resulting in privacy leakage.  In certain scenarios TURN
       usernames need not be linked to any real usernames given to users
       as they are just provisioned on a per company basis.

   4.  An Attacker posing as a TURN server challenges the client to
       authenticate, learns the USERNAME of the host and later snoops
       the traffic from the host identifying the user activity resulting
       in privacy leakage.

   5.  Hosting multiple realms on a single IP address is challenging
       with TURN.  When a TURN server needs to send the REALM attribute
       in response to an unauthenticated request, it has no useful
       information for determining which realm it should send, except
       the destination address of the request.  With TURN the only
       information available is the Source IP.  Note this is a problem
       with multi-tenant scenarios only.  This is not a problem when
       deployed in Enterprise.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define an architecture nor a protocol; as such
   it does not raise any security concern.
