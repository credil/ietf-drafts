1.  Introduction

   Channel binding as define in [I-D.ietf-emu-chbind] is used to
   imitigate lying authenticator , and is implemented as part of the
   ongoing EAP method, because the assertion transported from the EAP
   server to EAP peer is authenticated by the resluting key (TEK, to be
   more specific) derived from the EAP method.  Although it is a bit
   late to know the contacting authenticator is a liar after the peer
   has completed the EAP method, it is a rather reasonable compromise to
   the legacy EAP methods.

   EAP Tunnel methods, e.g., defined in
   [RFC4851][RFC5281][I-D.ietf-emu-eap-tunnel-method], are used to
   protect weak EAP methods, especially some legacy EAP methods.  When
   it comes to using channel binding in tunnel methods, it is more
   complex.  To maximise the compatibility , channel binding may still
   be carried out with the inner EAP method, using the inner TEK, or
   some key derived from tunnel key (output from tunnel method) and
   inner EAP method key, which has not been specified.  This way, a peer
   is assured of the honesty of the contacting authenticator only after
   both the tunnel establishement and the completement of the inner EAP
   method.

   Since tunnel methods are used to protect the inner method, it might
   be desirebale to provide channel binding simultaneously with or right
   after the tunnel establishment.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Channel Binding after Tunnel Establishment

   When there is no inner EAP method after the tunnel
   establishement,which is not ruled out in the current tunnel method
   specification, or the inner method does not output key, channel
   binding is carried out immediately after the tunnel establishment
   according to the procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-emu-chbind], the key
   used to authenticate the CB_Success or CB-Failure is derived from the
   tunnel key TK and some shared secret (TEK) between EAP server and the
   peer.  TEK could be NULL if no shared secret can be provided at this
   time.

   In this case, when TEK is NULL, the certificate verification of the
   EAP server (i.e., the tunnel server) is crucial, as pointed out in

   [I-D.ietf-emu-crypto-bind].


3.  Channel Binding after the First Inner Method

   When some inner methods are carried out after the tunnel
   establishment, and the first inner method outputs key, channel
   binding is executed along with the first inner method, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-emu-chbind],the key used to authenticate the CB-Success or
   CB_Failure is derived from the tunnel key TK and one of the outputs
   of the first inner method , i.e., TEK.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes to carry out channel binding as soon as
   possible, in the case of EAP tunnel method is involved, to detect
   rogueauthenticator as early as possible.
