Abstract

   This document describes the usage of Router Fingerprint
   Authentication (RFA) with public keys.  This can be used as a peer
   authentication method with KARP Key Management Protocol (KMP).  KARP
   KMP automates key negotiation for securing TCP-based pairwise Routing
   Protocols (RPs) like BGP, LDP.  The advantage of RFA is, neither it
   requires out-of-band, mutually agreeable symmetric keys nor a full
   PKI based system (trust anchor or CA certificates) for mutual
   authentication of the peers with KARP KMP deployments.  Usage of
   Router Fingerprints give a significant operational improvement from
   symmetric key based systems and yet provide a secure authentication
   technique.

Internet-Draft  KARP KMP: Simplified Peer Authentication       July 2012


1.  Introduction

   A Key Management Protocol (KMP) framework for TCP-based pair wise
   routing protocols (BGP [RFC4271], PCEP [RFC5440], MSDP [RFC3618] and
   LDP [RFC5036]) is detailed in
   [chunduri-karp-using-ikev2-with-tcp-ao].  Usage of IKEv2[RFC5996] as
   the KMP is also described in the same document.  This draft explores
   a simple and secure authentication method, which can be used for KARP
   KMP deployments.

   Currently operators don't often change the manual keys deployed for
   protecting the Routing Protocol (RP) messages because of various
   reasons as noted in Section 2.3 of KARP threat document [I-D.ietf-
   karp-threats-reqs].  One of the KARP WG goals is to define mechanisms
   to support key changes for all RPs which use either Manual Key
   Management (MKM) or KMP with out much operational overhead.

   Apart from Peer's identity verification, authentication and parameter
   negotiation, deployment of KMP can be more useful, when it comes to
   rekey the keys used by RPs.  Rekeying can be achieved with out the
   operator's intervention and as per the provisioned rekey policy.
   But, the usage of IKEv2 KMP opens up numerous possibilities for peer
   authentication.  Various peer authentication mechanisms with the
   advantages/drawbacks of each mechanisms are described in the Appendix
   of the [chunduri-karp-using-ikev2-with-tcp-ao] document.

   If symmetric pre-shared keys are used by IKEv2 KMP to authenticate
   the peer before generating the shared key(s), apart from the other
   issues with symmetric keys, the problem still remain the same when it
   comes to changing these keys.

   To reduce the operational costs for changing the keys at peering
   points with 100s of peers, this document describes the use of one of
   the available IKEv2 KMP peer authentication methods with raw or x.509
   encoded public keys (to be called as Router Fingerprints in the rest
   of the document).  Router Fingerprint Authentication (RFA) mechanism
   in conjunction with KARP KMP require neither out-of-band symmetric
   keys nor a fully functional PKI based system with trust anchor
   certificates as explained further in Section 2.

   Section 2 describes the Router Fingerprints in the context of various
   KMPs and specifically for IKEv2 KMP.  Generation and usage of the
   Router Fingerprints is described in Section 3 and Section 5 describes
   an error free method for publishing the Router Fingerprints.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Router Fingerprint

   Router Fingerprint is a sequence of bytes used to authenticate the
   public key before using the same to authenticate the peer in the
   context of KMP.

   Various forms of the fingerprint mechanism based on the public keys
   are already in use as defined in [RFC4252] and [RFC4253].
   Fingerprints are also used primarily for root key authentication in
   x.509 based PKI [RFC5280].  This documents only highlights the usage
   of raw public key based authentication mechanism already defined in
   [RFC5996] for KARP deployments.

   To generate a fingerprint:

   1.  A router need to generate an asymmetric Private/Public key pair.
       Asymmetric crypto algorithms based on RSA [RFC3447] or for
       shorter and still secure keys Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
       [RFC4492] can be used for generating the Private/Public key pair.

   2.  Once the Asymmetric key pair is generated, if needed, the public
       key can be in the form of raw public key as specified in
       [RFC5996] or can be encoded with any additional data (specific to
       the router) and can be in the form of more easily administrable
       X.509 PKI Certificate profile [RFC5280].

   3.  The result should be hashed with a cryptographic hash function,
       preferably SHA-256 or hash functions with similar strength (see
       more discussion on choosing preferred hash function in
       Section 7).

   The fingerprint generated is not a secret and can be distributed
   publicly.  This is further discussed in Section 5.


3.  Usage of Router Fingerprints with KARP KMP

   To use Router Fingerprints authentication with KARP KMP, a Private/
   Public key-pair MUST be generated by the router as specified in
   Section 2.  Base IKEv2 [RFC5996] standard supports only raw RSA based
   public keys.  The type of the public keys and encoding has to be more
   generic to deploy this peer authentication method.

   With current specification [RFC5996] when sender needs to get the
   certificate of the receiver, Certificate Request payload (CERTREQ as
   specified in [RFC5996]) is sent with cert encoding set to "Raw RSA
   Key" and Certification Authority field is empty.  The receiver of
   this CERTREQ payload, uses PKCS #1 encoding for the generated RSA
   Public Key and sends the same in CERT payload as Certificate Data
   with Certificate Encoding set to "Raw RSA Key" as described in
   Section 3.6 of IKEv2 [RFC5996].  Once the public key of the sender is
   received, the verification MUST be done with the already published/
   stored fingerprints of the sender.

   As noted above the current IKEv2[RFC5996] specification only supports
   raw RSA public keys.  [I-D.kivinen-ipsecme-oob-pubkey] enhances
   support for other types of public keys and also defines new encoding
   format to carry the public key fingerprint in the CERT payload.  For
   RPs to use Router Fingerprint Authentication in the context of IKEv2
   MUST follow the encoding format as specified in [I-D.kivinen-ipsecme-
   oob-pubkey].


4.  Impact on the PAD

   The Peer Authorization Database (PAD) and the role it plays in peer
   authentication is defined in section 4.4.3 of [RFC4301].  One of the
   functions of the PAD is to provide the authentication data for each
   peer.  [RFC4301] supports X.509 certificate or pre-shared secret
   authentication data types.  So, it is necessary to encode the raw
   public keys as X.509 certificates before sending the same in CERT
   payload.  Though the public key received is in the form of x.509
   certificate, for RFA, the PAD entry need not contain a trust anchor
   via which the end entity (EE) certificate or the public key for the

Internet-Draft  KARP KMP: Simplified Peer Authentication       July 2012


   peer must be verifiable.  The PAD entry MUST rather contain the
   published finger print of the peer.


5.  Publishing Router Fingerprints

   The router fingerprint generated is not a secret and can be exchanged
   out-of-band through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) at the RP peering
   points or can be distributed publicly.  A KARP KMP deployment using
   router fingerprints need to resort to out-of-band public key
   validation procedure to verify authenticity of the keys being used.
   The router fingerprints should be part of the KMP Peer Authorization
   Database (PAD) to validate the public key received in the KMP
   messages.  For conveying router fingerprints data bytes in a clear
   unambiguous way PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) wordlists can be used.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines no new namespaces.


7.  Security Considerations

   If collision attacks are perceived as a threat, the hash function to
   generate the fingerprints SHOULD also possess the property of
   collision-resistance.  To mitigate preimage attacks, the
   cryptographic hash function used for a fingerprint SHOULD possess the
   property of second preimage resistance.

   If generated fingerprints are truncated to make those short, the
   truncated fingerprints MUST be long enough to preserve the relevant
   properties of the hash function against brute-force search attacks.

   Considering the above facts, it's recommended to use SHA-256 or
   similar hash functions with good security properties to generate the
   fingerprints.
