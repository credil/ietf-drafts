    Offer/Answer Considerations for G.723 Annex A and G.729 Annex B
                   draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-g723-g729-02

Abstract

   RFC4856 describes the annexa parameter for G723 and the annexb
   parameter for G729, G729D and G729E. However, the specification does
   not describe the offerer and answerer behavior when the value of the
   annexa or annexb parameter does not match in the SDP offer and
   answer.  This document provides the offer/answer considerations for
   these parameters and updates RFC4856.

Internet-Draft   Offer/Answer G723 AnnexA & G729 AnnexB        June 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4856] describes the annexa parameter for G723 as follows:

      annexa: indicates that Annex A, voice activity detection, is used
      or preferred.  Permissible values are "yes" and "no" (without the
      quotes); "yes" is implied if this parameter is omitted.

   Also, [RFC4856] describes the annexb parameter for G729, G729D and
   G729E as follows:

      annexb: indicates that Annex B, voice activity detection, is used
      or preferred.  Permissible values are "yes" and "no" (without the
      quotes); "yes" is implied if this parameter is omitted.

   However, it does not have any normative statement for the case where
   the value of this parameter does not match in the SDP offer and
   answer.  For example, if the offer has G729 with annexb=yes and the
   answer has G729 with annexb=no, it can be interpreted in two
   different ways:
   o  The offerer and answerer proceed as if G729 is negotiated with
      annexb=yes, or
   o  The offerer and answerer proceed as if G729 is negotiated with
      annexb=no.

   Since [RFC4856] does not state it clearly, various implementations
   have interpreted the offer/answer in their own ways, resulting in a
   different codec being chosen to call failure, when the parameter
   value does not match in the offer and answer.

   [RFC3264] requires SDP extensions that define new fmtp parameters to
   specify their proper interpretation in offer/answer.  But, [RFC4856]
   does not specify it for the Annex A flavor of G.723 and the Annex B
   flavors of G.729, G.729D and G.729E.

   This document describes the offer/answer considerations for these
   parameters and provides the necessary clarifications.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft   Offer/Answer G723 AnnexA & G729 AnnexB        June 2013


3.  Offer/Answer Considerations

   [RFC3551] states that

      Receivers MUST accept comfort noise frames if restriction of their
      use has not been signaled.  The MIME registration for G729 in RFC
      3555 specifies a parameter that MAY be used with MIME or SDP to
      restrict the use of comfort noise frames.

   Based on the above, it is best not to use comfort noise frames if the
   SDP offer or answer indicates that comfort noise is not supported.

3.1.  Offer/Answer Considerations for G723 Annex A

   When the offer or answer has G723 and the annexa parameter is absent,
   the offerer or answerer knows that it has implied the default
   "annexa=yes".  This is because the annexa attribute is part of the
   original registration of audio/G723 [RFC4856].  All implementations
   that support G723 understand the annexa attribute.  Hence, this case
   MUST be considered as if the offer or answer has G723 with
   annexa=yes. .

   When the offer has G723 with annexa=yes and the answer has G723 with
   annexa=no, the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if G723 is
   negotiated with annexa=no.

   When the offer has G723 with annexa=no then the answer MUST NOT have
   annexa=yes for G723.  Thus the annexa parameter can be turned off by
   the answerer, but cannot be turned on.

   When the offer has G723 with annexa=no, the reason for not mandating
   that the answer MUST have annexa=no for G723 is that there are there
   implementations that omit the annexa parameter in answer and expect
   the least common denominator to be used.

   When the offer has G723 with no annexa parameter and the answer has
   G723 with annexa=yes, the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if
   G723 is negotiated with annexa=yes.

3.2.  Offer/Answer Considerations for G.729 Annex B, G.729D Annex B and
      G.729E Annex B

   In this section G729 represents any of G729 or G729D or G729E.

   When the offer or answer has G729 and the annexb parameter is absent,
   the offerer or answerer knows that it has implied the default
   "annexb=yes".  This is because the annexb attribute is part of the
   original registration of audio/G729 [RFC4856].  All implementations

   that support G729 understand the annexb attribute.  Hence, this case
   MUST be considered as if the offer or answer has G729 with
   annexb=yes. .

   When the offer or answer has G729 and the annexb parameter is absent,
   it MUST be considered as if the offer or answer has G729 with
   annexb=yes.

   When the offer has G729 with annexb=yes and the answer has G729 with
   annexb=no, the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if G729 is
   negotiated with annexb=no.

   When the offer has G729 with annexb=no then the answer MUST NOT have
   annexb=yes for G729.  Thus the annexb parameter can be turned off by
   the answerer, but cannot be turned on.

   When the offer has G729 with annexa=no, the reason for not mandating
   that the answer MUST have annexa=no for G729 is that there are there
   implementations that omit the annexa parameter in answer and expect
   the least common denominator to be used.

   When the offer has G.729 with no annexb parameter and the answer has
   G.729 with annexb=yes, the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if
   G.729 is negotiated with annexb=yes.
