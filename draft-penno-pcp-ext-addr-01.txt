1.  Introduction

   This document recommends PCP Server behavior in light of Address
   Pooling Paired (APP).

   Address Pooling Paired is defined in [RFC4787] REQ-2.

2.  Proposed Behavior

   In some recent discussions within the working group it was suggested
   that the text below from [RFC6887] may need changes:

      The MAP and PEER requests include a Suggested External IP Address
      field.  Some PCP-controlled devices, especially CGN but also
      multi- homed NPTv6 networks, have a pool of public-facing IP
      addresses.  PCP allows the client to indicate if it wants a
      mapping assigned on a specific address of that pool or any address
      of that pool.  Some applications will break if mappings are
      created on different IP addresses (e.g., active mode FTP), so
      applications should carefully consider the implications of using
      this capability.  Static mappings for that internal address (e.g.,
      those created by a command-line interface on the PCP server or
      PCP-controlled device) may exist to a certain external address,
      and if the suggested external IP address is the IPv4 or IPv6 all-
      zeros address, PCP SHOULD assign its mappings to the same external
      address, as this can also help applications using a mix of both
      static mappings and PCP-created mappings.  If, on the other hand,
      the suggested external IP address contains a non-zero IP address

      the PCP server SHOULD create a mapping to that external address,
      even if there are other mappings from that same internal address
      to a different external address.  Once an internal address has no
      implicit dynamic mappings and no explicit dynamic mappings in the
      PCP-controlled device, a subsequent implicit or explicit mapping
      for that internal address MAY be assigned to a different External
      address.  Generally, this reassignment would occur when a CGN
      device is load balancing newly seen internal addresses to its
      public pool of external addresses.

   Specifically, it says:

      Once an internal address has no implicit dynamic mappings and no
      explicit dynamic mappings in the PCP-controlled device, a
      subsequent implicit or explicit mapping for that internal address
      MAY be assigned to a different External address.

   That implies the corollary: While an internal address has *some*
   mappings in the PCP-controlled device, new implicit or explicit
   mappings for that internal address SHOULD be assigned the *same*
   external address.  Unfortunately, while it implies this, it does not
   actually state it.

   To clarify this the working group proposes submitting the following
   erratum:

   Change:

      ... Static mappings for that internal address (e.g., those created
      by a command-line interface on the PCP server or PCP-controlled
      device) may exist to a certain external address, and if the
      suggested external IP address is the IPv4 or IPv6 all-zeros
      address, PCP SHOULD assign its mappings to the same external
      address, as this can also help applications using a mix of both
      static mappings and PCP-created mappings.

   To:

      ... Static mappings for that internal address (e.g., those created
      by a command-line interface on the PCP server or PCP-controlled
      device) may exist to a certain external address.  If the suggested
      external IP address is the IPv4 or IPv6 all-zeros address, and the
      internal address currently has *any* active mappings (implicit,
      explicit, or static) with an external address of the indicated
      address family, then that external address SHOULD be used for the
      new mapping, so that PCP behavior follows NAT requirements of
      REQ-2 of [RFC4787] and REQ-2 of [RFC6888].If the existing mappings
      for that external address family do not all share a single

      external address, then the choice of which external address is
      assigned for the new mapping is implementation dependent.

3.  Use-Case

   The internal host creates real mappings for its services, and creates
   SRV records giving the external ports.  The question is whether those
   SRV records can share a single target hostname, which points to a
   single target address (which is what Mac OS X currently does).
   Requiring the code to potentially generate multiple different target
   hostnames pointing to different target addresses would add
   significant complexity (which is why we haven't done that).  With
   NAT-PMP [RFC6886] this was not an issue because there was only a
   single external address.

4.  PCP Server Behavior

   If the PCP Server can not maintain APP behavior for a new mapping
   then it should fail the request and send a CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL
   error back to the client.

   [N.E.] This is a departure from RFC6887 which says
   CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL error can only be sent back to client when
   PREFER_FAILURE was used in the request.  But since APP is mandatory,
   one could argue there is an implicit PREFER_FAILURE.  Should we come
   up with a more descriptive error code?  Or maybe we use NO_RESOURCES?

5.  PCP Client Behavior

   If a PCP client that has active mappings receives an error code of
   CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL (NO_RESOURCES?) for a new request it might
   mean that this new request would break APP behavior.  The client
   should not interpret this as that the NAT having no more free
   external IP address and ports overall.

   [N.E.] should there be an option for the client to say it does not
   care about APP?  The server of course does not need to honor such
   request, but for certain applications such as SSH, Telnet, HTTP, DNS,
   maintaining APP might not be needed.

6.  PCP Proxy Behavior

   If a PCP Proxy [I-D.ietf-pcp-proxy] has an associated NAT and can not
   maintain APP behavior for a new mapping, it should fail the request
   locally instead of forwarding it to the next upstream PCP Server.

   If the upstream Proxy can not main APP for the new mapping, it should
   fail the request, which will cause the downstream Proxy to also fail

   the request.  [N.E.] In the case of a CPE with a single public
   external address that acts as a PCP Proxy this might cause an
   application writer to interpret this error code as the local PCP
   Proxy running out of ports, which is not the case.

7.  Implementation Considerations

   PCP cannot require much more from NATs than what is already in RFC
   4787s and 6888.

   RFC 4787 requires of all NATs: REQ-2: It is RECOMMENDED that a NAT
   have an "IP address pooling" behavior of "Paired".

   RFC 6888 makes this requirement stronger for CGNs in particular:
   REQ-2: A CGN MUST have a default "IP address pooling" behavior of
   "Paired"

   If an application depends on this NAT behaviour, then it should use
   the PREFER_FAILURE option because a host behind a NAT cannot rely on
   its external address being always the same for a variety of reasons.
   More discussion can be found in [I-D.ietf-behave-requirements-update]
   section 5.

8.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
