1.  Introduction

   Table 1 shows the policy for registration of sub-services of the
   service URN with the 'sos' service type, as defined in section 4.2.
   of RFC 5031 [RFC5031].

   |                                                                   |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an  |
   | immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the  |
   | government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services |
   | can be added after expert review and must be of general public    |
   | interest and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is      |
   | designated by the ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in      |
   | their absence, the IESG.  The expert review should only approve   |
   | emergency services that are offered widely and in different       |
   | countries, with approximately the same caller expectation in      |
   | terms of services rendered.  The 'sos' service is not meant to    |
   | invoke general government, public information, counseling, or     |
   | social services.                                                  |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

                Table 1: Excerpt from RFC 5031 section 4.2.

   Some existing emergency services are, at least initially, offered in
   one country only.  Examples are the "Reporting spies" emergency
   service offered in South Korea and the "GAULA (anti-kidnapping)"
   emergency service offered in Colombia according to http://
   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number.  Future emergency
   service might also initially be introduced in one country only.

   The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with
   the 'sos' service type, as defined in RFC 5031 [RFC5031], prevents

   the registration of a sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos'
   service type for a service that, at the time of registration, is
   offered in one country only.

   This document updates section 4.2 of RFC 5031, in order to allow the
   registration of service URNs with the 'sos' service type for
   emergency services that, at the time of registration, are offered in
   one country only.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  Problem statement

   The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with
   the 'sos' service type, as defined in RFC 5031 [RFC5031], prevents
   the registration of a sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos'
   service type for an emergency service that, at the time of
   registration, is offered in one country only.

4.  Requirement

   REQ-1: It MUST be possible to register with IANA a sub-service of the
   service URN with the 'sos' service type as, defined in RFC 5031
   [RFC5031], for an emergency service offered in one country only.

5.  Update to RFC 5031

5.1.  General

   This section document updates replaces the text of the section 4.2
   (Sub-Services for the 'sos' Service) of RFC 5031 with the text of
   section 6.3 of this document.

5.2.  Original text of section 4.2 of RFC 5031

   This section defines the first service registration within the IANA
   registry defined in Section 4.1, using the top-level service label
   'sos'.

   The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an
   immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the
   government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services can
   be added after expert review and must be of general public interest

   and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is designated by the
   ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.
   The expert review should only approve emergency services that are
   offered widely and in different countries, with approximately the
   same caller expectation in terms of services rendered.  The 'sos'
   service is not meant to invoke general government, public
   information, counseling, or social services.


   urn:service:sos  The generic 'sos' service reaches a public safety
      answering point (PSAP), which in turn dispatches aid appropriate
      to the emergency.  It encompasses all of the services listed
      below.

   urn:service:sos.ambulance  This service identifier reaches an
      ambulance service that provides emergency medical assistance and
      transportation.

   urn:service:sos.animal-control  Animal control typically enforces
      laws and ordinances pertaining to animal control and management,
      investigates cases of animal abuse, educates the community in
      responsible pet ownership and wildlife care, and provides for the
      housing and care of homeless animals, among other animal-related
      services.

   urn:service:sos.fire  The 'fire' service identifier summons the fire
      service, also known as the fire brigade or fire department.

   urn:service:sos.gas  The 'gas' service allows the reporting of
      natural gas (and other flammable gas) leaks or other natural gas
      emergencies.

   urn:service:sos.marine  The 'marine' service refers to maritime
      search and rescue services such as those offered by the coast
      guard, lifeboat, or surf lifesavers.

   urn:service:sos.mountain  The 'mountain' service refers to mountain
      rescue services (i.e., search and rescue activities that occur in
      a mountainous environment), although the term is sometimes also
      used to apply to search and rescue in other wilderness
      environments.

   urn:service:sos.physician  The 'physician' emergency service connects
      the caller to a physician referral service.

   urn:service:sos.poison  The 'poison' service refers to special
      information centers set up to inform citizens about how to respond
      to potential poisoning.  These poison control centers maintain a

      database of poisons and appropriate emergency treatment.

   urn:service:sos.police  The 'police' service refers to the police
      department or other law enforcement authorities.



5.3.  New text replacing section 4.2 of RFC 5031

   This section defines the first service registration within the IANA
   registry defined in Section 4.1, using the top-level service label
   'sos'.

   The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an
   immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the
   government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services can
   be added after expert review.  The expert is designated by the ECRIT
   working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.  The
   expert review should only approve services that have emergency
   nature, that are offered in at least one country, that do not match
   description of any existing service URN with the 'sos' service type,
   and where the service description and the URN are defined as broadly
   as possible to encourage reuse.  The 'sos' service is not meant to
   invoke general government, public information, counseling, or social
   services.


   urn:service:sos  The generic 'sos' service reaches a public safety
      answering point (PSAP), which in turn dispatches aid appropriate
      to the emergency.  It encompasses all of the services listed
      below.

   urn:service:sos.ambulance  This service identifier reaches an
      ambulance service that provides emergency medical assistance and
      transportation.

      laws and ordinances pertaining to animal control and management,
      investigates cases of animal abuse, educates the community in
      responsible pet ownership and wildlife care, and provides for the
      housing and care of homeless animals, among other animal-related
      services.

   urn:service:sos.fire  The 'fire' service identifier summons the fire
      service, also known as the fire brigade or fire department.

   urn:service:sos.gas  The 'gas' service allows the reporting of
      natural gas (and other flammable gas) leaks or other natural gas

      emergencies.

   urn:service:sos.marine  The 'marine' service refers to maritime
      search and rescue services such as those offered by the coast
      guard, lifeboat, or surf lifesavers.

   urn:service:sos.mountain  The 'mountain' service refers to mountain
      rescue services (i.e., search and rescue activities that occur in
      a mountainous environment), although the term is sometimes also
      used to apply to search and rescue in other wilderness
      environments.

   urn:service:sos.physician  The 'physician' emergency service connects
      the caller to a physician referral service.

   urn:service:sos.poison  The 'poison' service refers to special
      information centers set up to inform citizens about how to respond
      to potential poisoning.  These poison control centers maintain a
      database of poisons and appropriate emergency treatment.

   urn:service:sos.police  The 'police' service refers to the police
      department or other law enforcement authorities.



6.  IANA Considerations

   OPEN ISSUE: Do we need to request IANA to take the updated section
   into consideration, or is IANA expected to do that by default, as the
   document updates the RFC 5031 procedures?

7.  Change Log

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please remove this section when publishing]

   Changes from draft-holmberg-ecrit-country-emg-urn-01

   o  Technical fix: Instead of creating a new sub-tree, the 'sos'
      registration rules in RFC 5031 are updated, to allow registration
      of URNs that, at the time of registration, are specific to a
      single country.

   Changes from draft-holmberg-ecrit-country-emg-urn-00

   o  Editorial fix: cannot be not fulfilled -> cannot be fulfilled
