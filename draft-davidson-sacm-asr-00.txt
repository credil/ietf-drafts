Abstract

   This specification defines the Asset Summary Reporting (ASR), a data
   model for expressing the data exchange format of summary information
   relative to one or more metrics. ASR reduces the bandwidth
   requirement to report information about assets in the aggregate since
   it allows for reporting aggregates relative to metrics, as opposed to
   reporting data about each individual asset, which can lead to a
   bloated data exchange. ASR is vendor neutral and leverages widely
   adopted, open specifications; it is flexible, and suited for a wide
   variety of reporting applications.

1  Introduction

   The Asset Summary Reporting (ASR) format is a data model to express
   the transport format of summary information about one or more sets of
   assets. The data model facilitates the interchange of aggregated
   asset information throughout and between organizations. ASR is vendor
   neutral and leverages widely adopted, open specifications; it is
   flexible, and suited for a wide variety of reporting applications.
   The primary goal of the ASR format is to describe summary information
   about one or more arbitrarily large and complex asset-related data
   sets in a standardized manner. Second, ASR seeks to allow content
   producers the ability to choose an appropriate level of detail
   depending on their needs and data set size requirements. Finally, ASR
   seeks to reduce the complexity of producing and consuming summary
   result documents. For the purposes of this specification, an asset is
   considered to be anything that has value to an organization.
   Computing devices are one form of asset that many organizations
   track. Additional examples are networks, people, and organizations.
   This specification, however, does not limit asset summary reporting
   to those examples; information about any set of assets may be
   summarized. While this specification was developed to support the
   immediate needs of the security automation and the continuous
   monitoring communities, it is expected that this specification will
   be valuable to any process where producing or consuming summary data
   is desired.

1.1 Purpose and Scope

   The purpose of this report is to define the ASR specification. The
   report gives an introduction to ASR version 1.0, defines ASR's data
   model, and documents the conformance requirements to comply with ASR.
   Other versions of ASR and the associated component specifications,
   including emerging specifications and future versions, are not
   addressed here. Future versions of ASR will be defined in distinct
   revisions of this report, each clearly labeled with a revision number
   and the appropriate ASR version number. This report does not describe
   the queries, instructions, methods, processes, or data required to
   produce an ASR document. This report does not describe how to
   transform any specific data model or data set into an ASR document.
   This report normatively describes only the ASR format. The appendices
   contain additional information about how to use ASR.

1.2 Audience

   The intended audience for this specification is product vendors who
   are developing applications that either produce or consume aggregated
   asset information, particularly those that will interoperate with
   other producers or consumers of aggregated asset information.

1.3 Document Structure

   The remainder of this document is organized into the following major
   sections:

   Section 2 defines the terms used within this specification and
   provides a list of common abbreviations.

   Section 3 describes how this specification relates to other standards
   and specifications.

   Section 4 defines the conformance requirements for ASR.

   Section 5 provides an overview of the ASR data model constructs and
   key concepts.

   Section 6 documents the ASR data model.

   Section 7 specifies the requirements for defining a record set type.

   Appendix A describes use cases for ASR.

   Appendix B indicates how to integrate ASR with the Asset Reporting
   Format (ARF).

   Appendix C provides some ASR examples.

   Appendix D provides examples of record set type definitions.

   Appendix E lists pre-defined record attributes.

   Appendix F documents normative references.


1.4 Document Conventions

   Throughout this specification, when referencing a specification
   listed in Appendix F, the name will be written between brackets, such
   as [XSD].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

   XML elements [XML] are referred to using qualified names when they
   are not in the ASR namespace. Elements with no prefix can be assumed
   to be in the ASR namespace, unless otherwise noted. A qualified name
   associates a named element with a namespace. The namespace identifies

   the specific XML schema that defines (and consequently may be used to
   validate) the syntax of the element instance. A qualified name
   declares this schema to element association using the format
   'prefix:element-name'. The association of prefix to namespace is
   defined in the metadata of an XML document and varies from document
   to document. In this specification, the conventional mappings listed
   in Table 1-1 are used.

3 Relationships to Existing Standards and Specifications

   ASR's relationships to other selected specifications are described
   below.

   1. Asset Identification - ASR leverages [Asset Identification] to
   identify assets for the ASR document. Asset Identification is a
   useful component of ASR, as it enables the correlation and fusion of
   various ASR documents and ASR content. ASR provides a place to
   optionally list assets defined using [Asset Identification].

   2. Asset Reporting Format (ARF) - ASR may be used as a payload for an
   Asset Reporting Format (ARF) document [ARF]. ASR is not required to
   be packaged as an ARF payload; however, Appendix B provides guidance
   on using ASR in an ARF report.

4 Conformance

   Developers and organizations may want to build products in
   conformance with ASR to foster consistency and interoperability of
   those products. Users of those products, and consumers of the content
   generated by those products, would then know the format of the data
   that the product will produce and can consume. In addition, products
   that conform to this specification will be better able to
   interoperate and exchange reporting information with other products
   that conform to ASR. Products may want to claim conformance with this
   specification to advertise their interoperability with other ASR
   compliant tools, as well as to meet requirements set by other
   specifications or organizations. The following sections define the
   criteria for content and products to claim conformance with this
   specification.

4.1 Product Conformance There are two types of ASR products: report
   producers and report consumers. Report producers are products that
   generate ASR documents, while report consumers are products that
   accept an existing ASR document and process it. Products claiming
   conformance with this specification SHALL adhere to the following
   requirements: 1. For report producers, generate well-formed content
   as defined in Section 4.2. 2. For report consumers, consume and
   process well-formed content as defined in Section 4.2. 3. Make an
   explicit claim of conformance to this specification in any
   documentation provided to end users. 

4.2 Content Conformance In order for an ASR report to be considered in
   compliance with this specification, the report MUST adhere to the
   following requirements: 1. The ASR report SHALL conform to all of the
   normative guidance provided in Section 6. 2. Each record set within
   an ASR report SHALL conform to the requirements set by its declared
   record-set-type, as described in Section 7.

5 ASR Data Model Overview and Key Concepts

   This section provides an overview of the ASR data model structure and
   design philosophy. The data model defines a format for representing
   one or more collections of data. A collection of data about assets is
   called a record set. At its simplest, an ASR report is a collection
   of record sets. The following sections introduce the key concepts of
   the ASR data model.

5.1 Data Model Overview

   The following sections provide a high level overview of the main data
   model constructs.

INTERNET DRAFT          Asset Summary Reporting       September 24, 2012


5.1.1 Summary Report

   An ASR document (i.e., a "summary report") is composed of one or more
   record sets. A summary report is the highest level notion in the ASR
   data model. One or more XML documents may compose a summary report,
   so the concept of a summary report is not confined to the physical
   boundaries of an XML document.

5.1.2 Record Set

   A record set is a collection of data organized into individual
   records. A record set optionally provides a reference to information
   about the source of the data for the records. The context of a record
   set is communicated by declaring a "type", known as a record set
   type. Section 5.2.2 provides more details regarding the record set
   type.

5.1.3 Record

   The record construct is the primary mechanism for conveying data in a
   summary report. All record data is contained in the attributes of the
   record construct. The properties of a record are defined by the
   record set type. The record construct may have any number of
   properties, as permitted by the record set type. In general,
   properties are expected to be qualified XML attributes as described
   in Section 5.2.1.

5.1.4 Data Source

   In addition to capturing a collection of records, a record set may
   capture information about the origin of the data in its records. Data
   source information is captured separately from the record set, but
   each record set may reference a data source. The same data source may
   be referenced by multiple record sets if that is appropriate for the
   summary report.

5.1.5 Metadata

   A summary report may have metadata about its creation. The metadata
   should include the name of the tool or person that generated the
   report, the time the report was generated, and any other pertinent
   information.

5.2 Key Concepts

   The following sections provide an overview of the key concepts in
   composing a summary report.

INTERNET DRAFT          Asset Summary Reporting       September 24, 2012


5.2.1 Record Attributes

   Record attributes are the core construct for construing information
   in ASR. A record set type defines the allowable and required
   attributes on a record in a particular record set. The attributes
   must be namespace qualified in order to give context as to the
   meaning of the attribute. In XML, attributes that are not namespace
   qualified belong to the "no namespace" realm, which does not give
   context to the meaning of the attribute. The namespace and local-name
   must be defined in the corresponding record set type.

5.2.2 Record Set Type

   The concept of a record set is generic in nature, and it is based on
   the expectation that a report creator must define a record set type
   or adopt an existing record set type. A record set type is a
   definition of a record set. The record set type defines all
   properties of a record set. In object-oriented programming, a class
   is the functional equivalent of a record set type, and an object is
   the functional equivalent of a record set instance. The record set
   type describes the attributes that "SHOULD", "MUST", and "MAY" be
   included in a record in that record set. It also describes the
   semantics of each attribute. Section 7 gives specific requirements
   for defining a record set type. While a record set type must be
   defined, the format of the record set type is not strictly defined. A
   record set type definition is an agreement between producer and
   consumer. It is anticipated that record set type definitions may take
   the form of prose, XML, spoken word, or any other form of
   communication capable of conveying the requirements of a record set
   type. The authors of this specification have provided a data model
   and XML schema for record-set-type-definitions that may be used for
   this purpose. The record-settype-definition data model is covered in
   Section 7, and that section also provides a pointer to the recordset-
   type-definition XML schema.

5.2.3 Paging

   Since a summary report can grow too large for available resources
   (e.g., network bandwidth, memory, CPU), a summary report may be
   divided into multiple pages. A paged summary report means that a
   single summary report is represented as two or more separate XML
   documents. This allows report creators the flexibility to reduce the
   resources required to produce and exchange a single large summary
   report by breaking it up into many smaller reports. Paging exists to
   support use cases where the amount of data contained in an ASR
   exceeds reasonable computing thresholds. Paging can be used to send
   multiple, smaller segments of information instead of one large block

   other pages when possible. All paging information is contained in the
   root element of each XML document.

5.2.4 Referencing Assets

   A record may be allowed or required to capture an asset list as a
   child. If an asset list is captured, there must be a count attribute
   in the record that is identified as the "count for the asset list",
   as defined in Section 7. That attribute must hold a value equal to
   the number of assets listed within the record. The "count for the
   asset list" attribute represents the count of assets that meet
   certain criteria. The criteria are specified in the description of
   the count attribute.

6 ASR Data Model Description

   This section describes the requirements for the ASR data model
   manifested as Extensible Markup Language (XML). Section 6.1 provides
   a conceptual overview of the data model, while Section 6.2 examines
   the actual XML data model in detail.

6.1 XML Data Model Introduction

   Figure 6-1 provides a logical view of a sample summary report spread
   across two pages. For brevity some attributes have been omitted. In
   the diagram, each record set claims a type and a data source
   description. Those items give additional context to understand the
   meaning of the data captured in the record set.

   +---------------------+



   The summary-report element is the root element of the ASR data model;
   it contains identification and paging information for an ASR
   document. One ASR document may be paged into multiple XML documents
   as desired, but each record set MUST be completely represented on one
   page of a summary report (i.e., a record set may not span multiple

   pages). Summary-report has three attributes: report-id, page-number,
   and last-page; it also has three children: metadata, record-set, and
   data-source. 

   The metadata element is a child of the summary-report element.
   Metadata contains information related to the generation of an ASR
   document. Metadata has two attributes: generator-name and timestamp.
   Metadata does not have any defined children, but there is an
   extension point where any arbitrary XML is allowed. 

   The record-set element is a child of the summary-report construct. A
   record-set contains summary data, and may appear multiple times in
   the same summary-report. Record-set has four attributes: id, data-
   source-ref, record-set-type, and comment. Data-source-ref is a
   reference to the data-source element that represents the source of
   the information used in the record-set, record-set-type indicates the
   type of report being represented, and the comment field allows a text
   comment, if desired. Record-set has one child: record.

   The record element is a child of the record-set construct, and
   contains any number of attributes; record may appear multiple times
   in the same record-set. Record has two children: asset-references and
   identifier-list; only one of the two may be present for a single
   report. Both children provide methods to identify and list the assets
   that each record describes. 

   The identifier-list element is used to enumerate assets that relate
   to data in the record. In the definition for the record set type, an
   attribute that contains a count may be associated with this list.
   When that occurs, the identification information captured in this
   element is known to enumerate the list of assets that make up the
   associated count. Assets are enumerated using this element through a
   unique identification scheme defined by capturing the URI for the
   schema. Subsequently, each id provided as a child to this element is
   understood within the context of the identifier scheme specified.
   This solution is optimal when assets are easily identified using a
   single string identifier.

   The asset-references element is used to enumerate assets that compose
   a count in the record. This element is used, instead of identifier-
   list, when assets are identified using [Asset Identification]. This
   element has a single attribute that accepts a list of identifiers.
   Those identifiers must match the identifiers of assets captured in
   the data-source element. The assets in the data-source element are
   identifiable using either [Asset Identification], or some other
   identification scheme. In either case, the identification may be more
   robust than is permitted with the identifier-list element.

   The data-source element is a child of the summary-report element. It
   has four attributes: id, resource, population-size, and comment. Id
   is the identifier of the data-source from which a record set is
   generated. Resource is a URI indicating the actual resource that the
   data-source element represents. Population-size indicates the number
   of assets that the resource has knowledge of. Comment allows a
   comment about the data-source. Data-source has four children: scan-
   info, extended-info, ai:assets, and asset-list. 

   The scan-info element is a child of the data-source element. Scan-
   info is intended to be used when the data-source is a network,
   vulnerability, compliance, or other type of scan. Scan-info has seven
   attributes: scan-id, authenticated, execution-location, scan-start,
   scan-end, population-applies-to, and population-assessed. Scan-id is
   the ID of the scan. Authenticated represents whether the scan was
   authenticated or not. Execution-location represents where the scan
   took place. Scan-start and scanend represent the start and end date
   and time of the scan. Population-applies-to represents the number of
   assets that the scan applied to; if a scanner has knowledge of 100
   assets, but a particular scan only applies to 50 of them (e.g., a
   patch scan for a specific OS), the population-applies-to would be set
   to 50. Population-assessed represents the number of assets that were
   assessed in the scan. Scan-info has one child, scanner.

   The scanner element is a child of scan-info. Scanner has three
   attributes: product-name, productversion, and scanner-type. The
   product-name contains the name of the scanner that produced this
   scan. Product name SHOULD be a CPE name or a SWID, but MAY be any
   string. Productversion indicates the version of the scanner. Scanner-
   type indicates the type of scanner. Scanner does not have any
   children.

   The extended-info element is a child of data-source. It is an
   extension point of the ASR schema, intended to allow data-source
   information that cannot be captured in other data-source constructs.
   Extended-info does not have any attributes. Extended-info may have
   any XML children. The ai:assets element is a child of data-source. It
   is defined in the [Asset Identification] specification, and is used
   to list assets. Please see the [Asset Identification] specification
   for details of this element.

   The asset-list element is a child of data-source. It is used to list
   assets when using ai:assets is not feasible or desired. Asset-list
   does not have any attributes. Asset-list has one child, asset, which
   is used to list individual assets.

   The asset element is a child of asset-list. Asset has one attribute,
   id. Id is used to uniquely identify a single asset within the scope

   of a data-source. Asset may have any XML children.

6.2 XML Data Model Requirements In order to comply with the ASR data
   model,

   The user MUST produce an XML asr:summary-report element consistent
   with the data model described below.

   The XML element produced MUST validate against the XSD for Asset
   Summary Format 1.0 listed at
   http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/asr/#resource-1.0. In situations
   where the XSD does not match the documented model in this
   specification, the XSD SHALL take precedence. The following tables
   formalize the data model. The data contained in the tables are
   requirements and MUST be interpreted as follows:

   The "Element Name" field indicates the name for the XML element being
   described. Each element name has a namespace prefix indicating the
   namespace to which the element belongs. See Table 1-1 for a mapping
   of namespace prefixes to namespaces.

   The "Definition" field indicates the prose description of the
   element. The definition field MAY contain requirement words as
   indicated in [RFC 2119].

   The "Properties" field is broken into four subfields:

   o The "Name" column indicates the name of a property that MAY or MUST
   be included in the described element, in accordance with the
   cardinality indicated in the "Count" field

   o The "Type" column indicates the REQUIRED data type for the value of
   the property. There are three categories of types: literal, element,
   and special. A literal type will indicate the type of literal as
   defined in [XSD]. An element type will reference the name of another
   element that ultimately defines that property. A special type is
   listed when the type is neither literal nor element. The special type
   will indicate the nature of permitted content, such as allowing any
   XML to be used.

   o The "Count" column indicates the cardinality of the property within
   the element. The property MUST be included in the element in
   accordance with the cardinality. If a range is given, and "n" is the
   upper-bound of the range, then the upper limit is unbounded.

   o The "Definition" column defines the property in the context of the
   element. The definition MAY contain requirement words as indicated in
   [RFC 2119].

7 Defining a Record Set Type

   A record set type is the definition of a record set; it gives context
   to a record set. A record set type is defined separate from a summary
   report. It defines the purpose of a record set, the required and
   optional attributes for each record, whether an asset list should be
   provided (and if so, which attribute it associates with), and any
   additional information related to the record set type. This section
   documents the requirements for defining a record set type. 

   A record set type may be defined in any form (e.g., verbal, human
   readable, XML). In whatever form the record set type definition
   takes, it MUST specify the following information:

   A namespace-qualified name, using [XSD Qual] Section 3.2 Qualified
   Locals,  identifying the record set type. This QName is referenced
   from each record set that implements the record set type. The record
   set type name is specified in the record-set-type attribute of the
   record-set element.

   The intended use of the record set type.

   The namespace-qualified attributes for each record within the record
   set type. Attributes MUST be namespace qualified as defined using
   [XSD Qual] Section 3.2 Qualified Locals.

   o For each attribute, it MUST indicate if the attribute MUST, MUST
   NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or MAY be present. For each attribute, it
   MUST also specify a description of the attribute.

   o If an asset list is permitted or required, a single attribute MUST
   be designated as the "countfor-asset-list" attribute. The count-for-

INTERNET DRAFT          Asset Summary Reporting       September 24, 2012


   asset-list attribute MUST have a type that only allows non-negative
   integers. A count-for-asset-list attribute SHALL contain an integer
   that is equal to the number of assets in the asset list for the
   record. The criteria for an asset to be included in the asset list
   MUST be specified in the description of the count-for-asset-list
   attribute.  An attribute SHALL NOT be identified as the 'count-for-
   asset-list' attribute when an asset list is prohibited. At most one
   attribute on a record set SHALL be specified as the count-for-
   assetlist attribute.

   Whether an asset list is required, permitted, or prohibited. If an
   asset list is required or permitted, it MUST indicate which attribute
   it is on the record that the list is associated with.

   Whether attributes not explicitly declared in the record set type are
   permitted.

   In the resources section of the ASR website, located at
   http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/asr/#resource- 1.0, an XSD
   provides a common XML format for representing a record set type.
   Record set types SHOULD be documented in the format defined by the
   XSD, though they are not required to be. See the XSD for details on
   documenting the record set type in that format.

   Additionally, two Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
   (XSLTs) are provided on the resources section of the ASR website to
   support record set types documented in the above referenced XSD
   format.  The first XSLT document converts record set type XML
   documents into a human readable HTML file.  The second XSLT accepts
   an ASR document as input, along with a record set type as a
   parameter.  The XSLT analyzes the ASR document against the provided
   record set type, and reports any errors that are discovered. Both of
   the XSLTs, along with the record set type XSD, are informative and
   are intended to assist with adopting ASR.

9  Security Considerations

   As a data format, Asset Summary Reporting does not have security
   concerns that are known at this time. However, as a data format
   designed to be stored and transmitted between entities within an
   enterprise, the fact of the matter is that it SHOULD be used within a
   properly secured environment.  Over time, a significant amount of
   information valuable to attackers can be gleaned from Asset Summary
   Reporting information.  Therefore, it is recommended that use of

   Asset Summary Reporting be performed in environments providing
   communication security mechanisms supplying the properties of
   confidentiality, data integrity, and non- repudiation.

Appendix B Use Cases

   This appendix documents some common use cases that were considered
   when developing ASR.

A.1 Continuous Monitoring

   Information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) is defined as
   maintaining ongoing awareness of information security,
   vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk
   management decisions. Organizational security status is determined
   using metrics established by the organization to best convey the
   security posture of an organization's information and information
   systems, along with organizational resilience given known threat
   information. Among other requirements, ISCM tools must provide
   reporting with the ability to tailor output and drill down from high-
   level, aggregate metrics to systemlevel metrics, and allow for data
   consolidation into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
   tools and dashboard products.

   ASR intends to meet the tool needs above by providing a vendor and
   technology neutral, and flexible reporting data model. ASR places few
   constraints on the type and nature of data that can be transported
   using its model, so many types of continuous monitoring data may be
   communicated using the model.

A.2 Security Automation

   Security automation efforts (e.g. the Security Content Automation
   Protocol (SCAP)), are another use case for ASR. An example of a
   security automation need is a system administrator who needs to
   assess the 15,000 desktops on her network for compliance with the
   United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB), a government
   baseline for security settings. The system administrator runs the
   USGCB content against all desktops on her network, and receives one
   result file per desktop. Each result file contains, for each security

   check, a pass/fail indication, required setting, and actual setting.
   There are over 200 security settings checked per desktop. In order to
   avoid manually reviewing each result, the system administrator
   decides to use summary reporting. The system administrator creates
   three reports, detailed below. A sample record is provided for each
   report. Note that attributes with the 'example' prefix are defined
   only in the scope of this use case.

   A report that shows the overall compliance percentage of desktops on
   the network. This summary report is used in a monthly dashboard that
   is presented to upper management. <asr:record
   example:compliance_pct="73"/>

   Percentage compliance scores for each desktop on the network. This
   report is used to track perdesktop compliance trends and identify
   high-risk desktops. <asr:record example:hostname="desktop1"
   example:compliance_score="100"/>

   Percentage compliance scores for the compliance of each security
   setting across the network. This report is used as a component in
   taking a risk-based approach to remediation. A bulletin of the top
   five non-compliant settings is generated monthly and sent to all
   employees as part of a security awareness campaign. <asr:record asr-
   attr:xccdf-benchmark="USGCB: Guidance for Securing Microsoft Windows
   7 Systems for IT Professional" asr-attr:xccdf-profile=
   "united_states_government_configuration_baseline_version_1.2.0.0"
   asr-attr:xccdf-rule="minimum_password_length"
   example:compliance_score="75"/> Since the summary reports are in a
   standard format, they can be consumed by an application and presented
   in a meaningful manner. One meaningful presentation of this data is a
   list of security checks sorted from least compliant to most
   compliant. The system administrator has used summary reporting to
   increase the visibility and transparency of her security operations
   to management and end users, improved the accuracy and completeness
   of her data, and prioritized her highest value work.

Appendix C Integration with ARF

   The Asset Reporting Format (ARF) is a data model for expressing the
   exchange format of information about assets and the relationships
   between assets and reports. The data model facilitates the reporting,
   correlating, and fusing of asset information throughout and between
   organizations. The intent of ARF is to provide a uniform foundation
   for the expression of reporting results, fostering more widespread
   application of sound IT management practices.

   ARF has four primary components: assets, reports, report requests,
   and relationships. Assets, reports, and report requests exist in

INTERNET DRAFT          Asset Summary Reporting       September 24, 2012


   isolated buckets. The relationships component allows for explicit
   relationships between components (assets, report-requests, and
   reports) and uses a controlled vocabulary to do so. ASR reports may
   be captured as report objects in ARF. When an ASR is captured as an
   ARF report payload, a relationship MAY be established between the ASR
   report and the report request that caused the ASR to be generated.
   ARF 1.1 defines a relationship type arf-rel:createdFor in [ARF] Table
   6-1. The arf-rel:createdFor relationship, established with the ASR
   report object as the subject and the report request object as the
   object, provides a well-defined connection between the request and
   response. Additional relationships may be defined between ASR reports
   and other reports as needed. Those relationships should be determined
   by the report creators and collaborators as needed.

Appendix D Record Set Example

   This section shows an example scenario where an ASR report is
   created. To illustrate the record set concept, consider a scenario
   where the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of Example Corp
   wants to know the organization's security posture relative to a
   recently published CVE (http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
   bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2013). The following ASR document
   accurately reports an answer to the CISO's question:

   <asr:summary-report xmlns:ex="com.example"    
   xmlns:asr="http://scap.nist.gov/schema/asset-summary-reporting/1.0" 
   xmlns:asr-attr="http://scap.nist.gov/schema/asset-
   summaryreporting/1.0/attr"   page-number="1" last-page="true" report-
   id="d1e1">  <asr:metadata timestamp="2011-11-08T14:27:44.97Z"/> 
   <asr:record-set id="asr:com.example:rset:1"    data-source-
   ref="asr:com.example:dsrc:1"    record-set-type="ex:cve-report-
   small">    <asr:record asr-attr:cve-id="CVE-2011-2013"      asr-
   attr:inventory-finding="EXISTS" asr-attr:count="50"/>    <asr:record
   asr-attr:cve-id="CVE-2011-2013"      asr-attr:inventory-
   finding="NOT_EXISTS" asr-attr:count="170"/>    <asr:record asr-
   attr:cve-id="CVE-2011-2013"      asr-attr:inventory-
   finding="NOT_APPLICABLE" asr-attr:count="30"/>  </asr:record-set> 
   <asr:data-source id="asr:com.example:dsrc:1"
   resource="VulnDb.abc.com" population-size="250"/> </asr:summary-
   report>

   Notice that the summary report uses attributes defined in the ASR
   Common Attributes schema. While record set types may use any XML
   attribute, it is preferable to leverage existing attributes defined
   in the ASR Common Attributes schema. This is one such example where
   existing attributes are useful. Since this vulnerability has a CVSS
   score of 10.0 and a rating of 'Critical' has been given to the patch
   that fixes this vulnerability, the CISO forwards this information to

   the Windows Support Team. The CISO requests that the Windows Support
   Team apply the appropriate patch quickly. In order to honor the
   request, the Windows Support Team needs the report broken up by
   operating system and physical location, with a list of assets. With
   this information, the Windows Support Team will be able to
   efficiently deploy their resources for patching. The Windows Support
   Team requests the report with those additional details (only for
   systems that need to be patched). The following ASR document
   accurately reports the needed information. Asset listings have been
   truncated for simplicity.

   With the above summary report, the Windows Support Team can deploy
   the necessary resources to the appropriate locations. With the asset
   list present in the identifier-list element, the resources deployed
   to Miami and Boston will be able to accurately and completely
   remediate the CVE. The report in this section is described in
   Appendix D.

   In this report, Example Corp used attributes defined in the ASR
   Common Attributes Schema (cve-id, cpe, inventory-finding, and count)
   as well as an attribute that Example Corp defined, location.

   The record sets used in this example have a record-set-type of 'cve-
   report-small' and 'cve-reportinformative', respectively. While this
   example uses two record-set-types, it is possible to use a single,
   more flexible record-set-type. Record-set-types may be flexible or
   restrictive, depending on the requirements of the entity that defines
   the record-set-type. Both examples are given in Appendix D

Appendix E Sample Record Set Type Definitions

   This section describes an example of creating record set type
   definitions for the ASR reports described in Appendix C. Those
   reports leverage two record set types: ex:cve-report-small and
   ex:cve-reportinformative. The fictitious record set type cve-report-
   small is illustrated below. To demonstrate the flexibility of record
   set type definitions, a more permissive record set type is included
   in this section below the ex:cve-report-small example.

   Record Set Type Name: {com.example}cve-report-small Description: To
   report on the number of computers affected by a CVE. Attributes

   asr-attr:cve-id - MUST include. This is the CVE ID being reported on.
   Type: XML schema "string".

   asr-attr:inventory-finding - MUST include. This is a status of the
   CVE for each asset in the count. Value must be one of "EXISTS",
   "NOT_EXISTS", "NOT_APPLICABLE", "NOT_REPORTED", "ERROR", or
   "UNKNOWN". Type: XML schema "string".

   asr-attr:count - MUST include. Asset list is associated with this
   attribute. This count is the number of assets with the CVE related to
   the asset via the inventory-finding. Type: XML schema
   nonNegativeInteger.

   The description above documents the following:

   The record set type name "ex:cve-report-informative".

   That attributes beyond those listed in the record set type are
   permitted in record sets. Therefore, in the second example in
   Appendix C, "asr-attr:cpe" and "ex-attr:location" are permitted. This
   is known because of the value of "permit-additional-attributes".

   The required attributes for the report. For each cve-id, inventory-
   finding, and count, it specifies that the attribute must be included.

   The attribute associated with the asset list. In this case, "asr-
   attr:count" is the count associated with the asset listing.

   The use of asset listings. In this case, the report may optionally
   use the identifier list (which the second report in Appendix C does),
   but it may not use the asset references element.

   All of the information needed to properly format the aforementioned
   record sets is included in the record set type definitions given
   above.


   This section contains a list of XML attributes defined in the ASR
   Common Attributes XSD located at
   http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/asr/#resource-1.0. These
   attributes are defined to provide a core of usable attributes with a
   common meaning across multiple areas. Each attribute is accompanied
   with a short description that describes what it means. Usage of this
   XSD and its associated attributes is RECOMMENDED, but not required. 

   Some attributes may require additional context in order to make
   sense. For example, the statistical 'count' attribute has little
   meaning by itself. The context can be provided in the record-set-type
   definition through the report's description of the attribute. For
   example, if a record-set-type definition had the following text in

   count of employees that have completed the annual security awareness
   training."

   All attributes in this section are defined in the following
   namespace: http://scap.nist.gov/schema/assetsummary-
   reporting/1.0/attr. Types specified with the prefix "xs:" are XML
   schema datatypes as defined in [XSD] Part 2. Unless otherwise
   specified, values for all attributes are restricted to xs:string. All
   pattern restrictions are XML schema regular expressions as defined in
   [XSD] Part 2, Section G

F.4 Other Attributes

   This is a list of attributes that do not fit into another category.
   Some of these attributes exist to provide a common name in attempt to
   provide interoperability and may be further restricted as reporting
   scenarios dictate.

E.2 Finding Attributes

   This section contains attributes related to findings. Each finding
   attribute has values that allow the state of the finding to be
   indicated as well as attributes that allow for the indication of
   various non-finding conditions (error, not applicable, etc.)
