1.  Introduction

   Network services are widely deployed and essential in new data center
   network and cloud architecture, which requires more flexible network
   service deployment models.  The network services provide many
   functions: such as NAT, Firework, and server load balancing.

   This document provides a network service based forwarding by metadata
   passing information between the network forwarding nodes (NFN).  The
   packet is handled in a network forwarding node (NFN), and the
   forwarding parameters for that packet is encapsulated as metadata
   format and then inserted into the packet to form a service forwarding
   path, then the packet is passed to next network forwarding node.
   This mechanism improves the forwarding efficiency and flexibility by
   using the information from the previous NFN.  In addition, a
   procedure to negotiate the metadata format is provided in this
   document.

2.  Terminology

   Network Forwarding Node: NFN,is a programmable Router/Switch, or even
   a logical switch device.

   Network Controller Node: NCN.It interacts with NFN.  The NCN
   negotiates the NSC metadata format with the NFNs.

   Network service chaining: NSC, a service chain defines the services
   path required.

   Metadata:a register value that is used to pass information from one
   NFN to the other.

3.  Network Service Chaining Metadata Component Structure

   Figure 1 is the metadata NSC component architecture.  Consider three
   NFNs in the NSC network, NFN A, NFN B and NFN C. NFN A and NFN B
   support the same metadata format, i.e.  metadata1.  NFN B and NFN C
   support another metadata format i.e.metadata 2.

   The edge network forwarding node (NFN A) receives the packets from
   the traditional networks, and inserts the metadata to the packet
   based on the metadata 1 format.  The packets including metadata 1 are
   transferred from NFN A to NFN B via a tunnel protocol specified by
   metadata 1.

   After receiving the packets from NFN A, NFN B parses the packets
   according to the definition of metadata 1.  This metadata is
   transparent to any other NFNs between NFN A and NFN B as they cannot
   be aware of metadata 1.

   Similarly, the packets including metadata 2 are transferred from NFN
   B to NFN C via a tunnel protocol specified by metadata 2.

4.  Network Service Chaining Metadata Format

   Metadata format is defined as Figure 2.  The metadata contains
   following fields:

   Transport type: is the corresponding value for the transport link
   that metadata would be carried (e.g. Ethertype, protocol number, UDP
   destination port).  Metadata could be carried by different transport
   links.  If it is carried by Ethernet link, the metadata is
   encapsulated as the payload of Ethernet frame, and the transport type
   is an Ethernet type/Length value (e.g. 0xa811, TBD).  If it is
   carried by IP network, the transport type is a protocol number.  If
   it is carried in UDP message, the metadata is in the UDP PDU message,
   and the corresponding transport type is UDP destination port.

   Reserved: is reserved for future use.

   Format ID: represents ID of this metadata format.  The format ID is
   unique to identify a metadata format.  There are 256 types of
   metadata format for maximum.

   Length: indicates the total length of the metadata.

   Service attribute: represents the attribute of the service for the
   metadata.  It could be a flow-id of the traffic, or dpi-id for the
   DPI service.

   If the packets carrying metadata are transferred via Ethernet type ,
   the Ethertype would be replaced as 0xyyyy (e.g. 0xa811), and the
   original Ethertype could be stored as one of the service attribute of
   the metadata.  When the next NFN receives the packets, it
   decapsulates the packets and retrieves the original Ethertype
   according to the value carried in the metadata.

5.  Network Service Chaining Metadata Generation

   The NCN could request NFN to encapsulate the metadata or not.  If the
   metadata needs to be encapsulated in the packet, the NCN would
   indicate the NFN how to generate and encapsulate the metadata.  The
   NCN could send the metadata generation message to the NFN, including
   the transport type, generation parameters.  For the source of the
   metadata content could be generated by the following methods:

   o  FIX: the value is determined by the NCN.

   o  PACKET: the value comes from the packet, and the field is
      specified by the NCN.

   o  LOCAL: the value is generated locally.  For example, it is a
      32bits random value, or 64bits time stamp.

   o  METADATA: the value comes from the metadata from the previous NFN.

6.  Metadata Format Negotiation

   Metadata is configured locally in a network forwarding node by CLI,
   SNMP.  Each network forwarding nodes could support several metadata
   formats (metadata format list).  The network forwarding node reports
   its metadata format list to the network controller node via a
   protocol, which could be the extension of the existing protocol, such
   as I2RS protocol ([I2RS]), or some other new protocol.  When NCN
   computes the service path based on the service requirements, it sends
   the metadata format or rules to the NFNs corresponding to a specific
   service path, to indicate those NFN's metadata encapsulation methods
   for their next NFNs.

7.  Benefits of NSC Metadata

   The network service chaining metadata can provides the following
   benefits:

   (1)  Providing service chaining path: The data plane forwarding
      parameters for a service could be added to service attribute
      fields of metadata.  The service is usually classified, and formed
      the forwarding parameters, which are encapsulated as metadata
      format at the edge network forwarding node.  The other NFNs
      supporting the same metadata format can use the forwarding
      parameters for service forwarding when receive the packets with
      that metadata encapsulation.

   (2)  Programmability and flexibility: the metadata format is
      negotiated among NFNs, and can be programmable through NCN.  The
      NFN can support 256 types of metadata at most, which can satisfy
      the current service requirements In addition, the metadata can be
      carried at multiple transport networks (e.g. Ethernet, IP, and
      UDP).

   (3)  Compatibility: the packet with metadata encapsulation is
      transparent to any other NFNs which do not support metadata
      format.  This solution does not bring any compatibility issues for
      the current networks.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a protocol number (xx) if transport
   type is IP network, and a port number (xxxx) if UDP message.
