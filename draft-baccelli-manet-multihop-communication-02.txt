1.  Introduction

   Experience gathered with ad hoc routing protocol development,
   deployment and operation, shows that wireless communication presents
   specific challenges [RFC2501] [DoD01], which Internet protocol
   designers should be aware of, when designing solutions for ad hoc
   networks at the IP layer.  This document briefly describes these
   challenges.

2.  Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Networks

   For the purposes of this document, a multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   network will be considered to be a collection of devices that each
   have a radio transceiver, that are using the same physical and medium
   access protocols, that are moreover configured to self-organize and
   provide store-and-forward functionality on top of these protocols as
   needed to enable communications.  The devices providing network
   connectivity are considered to be routers.  Other non-routing
   wireless devices, if present in the ad hoc network, are considered to
   be "end-hosts".  The considerations in this document apply equally to
   routers or end-hosts; we use the term "node" to refer to any such
   network device in the ad hoc network.

   Examples of multi-hop ad hoc wireless network deployment and
   operation include wireless community networks such as
   Funkfeuer[FUNKFEUER] and Freifunk[FREIFUNK]; these use routers
   running OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing [RFC3626]) on IEEE 802.11
   in ad hoc mode with the same ESSID (Extended Service Set
   Identification) at the link layer.  Multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   networks may also run on link layers other than 802.11, and may use
   routing protocols other than OLSR (for instance, AODV[RFC3561],
   TBRPF[RFC3684], DSR[RFC4728], or OSPF-MPR[RFC5449]).

Internet-Draft   Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Communication       July 2013


   In contrast, simple hosts communicating through an 802.11 access
   point in infrastructure mode do not form a multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   network, since the central role of the access point is predetermined,
   and since nodes other than the access point do not generally provide
   store-and-forward functionality.

3.  Common Packet Transmission Characteristics in Multi-hop Ad Hoc
    Wireless Networks

   Let A and B be two nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network N.
   Suppose that, when node A transmits a packet through its interface on
   network N, that packet is correctly received by node B without
   requiring storage and/or forwarding by any other device.  We will
   then say that B can "detect" packets transmitted by A, or more simply
   that B detects A.  Note that therefore, when B detects an IP packet
   transmitted by A, the TTL of the IP packet detected by B will be
   precisely the same as it was when A transmitted that packet.

   Let S be the set of nodes that can detect packets transmitted by node
   A through its interface on network N. The following section gathers
   common characteristics concerning packet transmission over such
   networks, which were observed through experience with MANET routing
   protocol development (OLSR[RFC3626], AODV[RFC3561], TBRPF[RFC3684],
   DSR[RFC4728], or OSPF-MPR[RFC5449]), as well as deployment and
   operation (Freifunk[FREIFUNK], Funkfeuer[FUNKFEUER]).

3.1.  Asymmetry, Time-Variation, and Non-Transitivity

   First, even though a node C in set S can (by definition) detect
   packets transmitted by node A, there is no guarantee that node C can,
   conversely, send IP packets directly to node A. In other words, even
   though C can detect packets transmitted by A (since it is a member of
   set S), there is no guarantee that A can detect packets transmitted
   by C. Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications may be
   "asymmetric".  Such cases are common.

   Second, there is no guarantee that, as a set, S is at all stable,
   i.e.  the membership of set S may in fact change at any rate, at any
   time.  Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications may be "time-
   variant".  Time variation is often observed in multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks due to variability of the wireless medium, and to
   node mobility.

   Now, conversely, let V be the set of nodes which A detects -- in
   other words, IP packets transmitted by any node in set V are received
   directly by A, without TTL decrement.  Suppose that node A is
   communicating at time t0 through its interface on network N.  As a
   consequence of time variation and asymmetry, we observe that A:

   1.  cannot assume that S = V,

   2.  cannot assume that S and/or V are unchanged at time t1 later than
       t0.

   Furthermore, transitivity is not guaranteed over multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks.  Indeed, let's assume that, through their
   respective interfaces within network N:

   1.  node B and node A can detect one another (i.e. node B is a member
       of sets S and V), and,

   2.  node A and node C can also detect one another (i.e. node C is a
       also a member of sets S and V).

   These assumptions do not imply that node B can detect node C, nor
   that node C can detect node B (through their interface on network N).
   Such "non-transitivity" is common on multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   networks.

   In a nutshell: multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications can be
   asymmetric, non-transitive, and time-varying.

3.2.  Radio Range and Wireless Irregularities

   Section 3.1 presents an abstract description of some common
   characteristics concerning packet transmission over multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks.  This section describes practical examples, which
   illustrate the characteristics listed in Section 3.1 as well as other
   common effects.

   Wireless communication links are subject to limitations to the
   distance across which they may be established.  The range-limitation
   factor creates specific problems on multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   networks.  In this context, the radio ranges of several nodes often
   partially overlap.  Such partial overlap causes communication to be
   non-transitive and/or asymmetric, as described in Section 3.1.
   Moreover, the range varies from one node to another, depending on
   location and environmental factors.  This is in addition to the time
   variation of range and signal strength caused by variability in the
   local environment.

   For example, as depicted in Figure 1, it may happen that a node B
   detects a node A which transmits at high power, whereas B transmits
   at lower power.  In such cases, B detects A, but A cannot detect B.
   This examplifies the asymmetry in multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   communications as defined in Section 3.1.

      Figure 1: Asymmetric Link example. Node A can communicate with
        node B, but B cannot communicate with A.


   Another example, depicted in Figure 2, is known as the "hidden node"
   problem.  Even though the nodes all have equal power for their radio
   transmissions, they cannot all detect one another.  In the figure,
   nodes A and B can detect one another, and A and C can also detect one
   another.  On the other hand, nodes B and C cannot detect one another.
   When nodes B and C try to communicate with node A simultaneously,
   their radio signals collide.  Node A will only be able to detect
   noise, and may even be unable to determine the source of the noise.
   The hidden terminal problem illustrates the property of non-
   transitivity in multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications as described
   in Section 3.1.

   Another situation, shown in Figure 3, is known as the "exposed node"
   problem.  In the figure, node A is transmitting (to node B).  As

   shown, node C cannot reliably communicate with node D, because of the
   on-going transmission of node A, presenting interference within C's
   radio-range.  Node C cannot detect D, but node D can detect C because
   D is outside A's radio range.  Node C is then called an "exposed
   node", because it is exposed to co-channel interference from node A
   and thereby prevented from exchanging protocol messages to enable
   data transmission to node D -- even though the transmission would be
   successful and would not interfere with the reception of data sent
   from node A to node B.

        Figure 3: The exposed node problem. When node A is communicating
           with node B, node C is an "exposed node".


   Hidden and exposed node situations are often observed in multi-hop ad
   hoc wireless networks.  Problems with asymmetric links may also arise
   for reasons other than power inequality (e.g., multipath
   interference).  Such problems are often resolved by specific
   mechanisms below the IP layer.  However, depending on the link layer
   technology in use and the position of the nodes, such problems due to
   range-limitation and partial overlap may affect the IP layer.

   Besides radio range limitations, wireless communications are affected
   by irregularities in the shape of the geographical area over which
   nodes may effectively communicate (see for instance [MC03], [MI03]).
   For example, even omnidirectional wireless transmission is typically
   non-isotropic (i.e. non-circular).  Signal strength often suffers
   frequent and significant variations, which are not a simple function
   of distance.  Instead, it is a complex function of the environment
   including obstacles, weather conditions, interference, and other
   factors that change over time.  Because each individual link has to
   encounter different terrain, path, obstructions, atmospheric
   conditions and other phenomena, analytical formulation of signal
   strength is considered intractable [VTC99], and the radio engineering
   community has thus developed numerous radio propagation models,
   relying on median values observed in specific environments [SAR03].

   The above irregularities also cause communications on multi-hop ad
   hoc wireless networks to be non-transitive, asymmetric, or time-
   varying, as described in Section 3.1, and may impact protocols at the

   IP layer and above.  There may be no indication to IP when a
   previously established communication channel becomes unusable; "link
   down" triggers are generally absent in multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   networks, since the absence of detectable radio energy (e.g., in
   carrier waves) may simply indicate that neighboring nodes are not
   currently transmitting.  Such an absence of detectable radio energy
   does not therefore indicate whether or not transmissions have failed
   to reach the intended destination.

4.  Alternative Terminology

   Many terms have been used in the past to describe the relationship of
   nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network based on their ability
   to send or receive packets to/from each other.  The terms used in
   this document have been selected because the authors believe they are
   unambiguous, with respect to the goal of this document (see
   Section 1).

   Nevertheless, here are a few other terms that describe the same
   relationship between nodes in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.  In
   the following, let network N be, again, a multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   network.  Let the set S be, as before, the set of nodes that can
   directly receive packets transmitted by node A through its interface
   on network N. In other words, any node B belonging to S can detect
   packets transmitted by A. Then, due to the asymmetry characteristic
   of wireless links:

      - We may say that node B hears node A. In this terminology, there
      is no guarantee that node A is hears node B, even if node B hears
      node A.

      - We may say that node B is reachable from node A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is reachable from
      node B, even if node B is reachable from node A.

      - We may say that node A has a link to node B. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node B has a link to node
      A, even if node A has a link to node B.

      - We may say that node B is adjacent to node A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is adjacent to node
      B, even if node B is adjacent to node A.

      - We may say that node B is downstream from node A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is downstream from
      node B, even if node B is downstream from node A.

Internet-Draft   Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Communication       July 2013


      - We may say that node B is a neighbor of node A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is a neighbor of
      node B, even if node B a neighbor of node A.  As it happens, the
      terminology for "neighborhood" is quite confusing for asymmetric
      links.  When B can detect signals from A, but A cannot detect B,
      it is not clear whether B should be considered a neighbor of A at
      all, since A would not necessarily be aware that B was a neighbor.
      Perhaps it is best to avoid the "neighbor" terminology except for
      symmetric links.

   This list of alternative terminologies is given here for illustrative
   purposes only, and is not suggested to be complete or even
   representative of the breadth of terminologies that have been used in
   various ways to explain the properties mentioned in Section 3.

5.  IP over Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless

   The characteristics of packet transmission over multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks, described in previous sections, are not the
   typical characteristics expected by IP [RFC6250].  Nevertheless, it
   is possible and desirable to run IP over such networks, through the
   use of:

      IP interface configuration, such as described in RFC 5889
      [RFC5889], or

      routing protocols designed for operation over wireless interfaces,
      for example OLSR[RFC3626], AODV[RFC3561], or OSPF-MPR[RFC5449].

   Thus, even though the physical effects described in this document
   require robust protocol designs for routing and topology management,
   the experience in the projects described in the cited references
   shows that useful networks can be designed and operated using well-
   understood techniques.  Protocols running above the IP layer can be
   shielded somewhat from the unusual characteristics experienced over
   multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.  Note however that some protocols
   are nevertheless more appropriate than others when interfaces to
   multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks are involved in the communication.
   For instance, for applications written to run over both UDP and TCP,
   the latter choice may be preferred in situations with relatively high
   packet loss rates.  But such choices must be based on application
   requirements.
