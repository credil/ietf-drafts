    Localization for Mobile Nodes in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 Network 
                draft-jiang-netext-pmip-localization-00


Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility
   management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. When the
   numbers of MNs which attaching to the same MAG is very large, how to
   manage those MNs is very urgent. Some MNs are active and have to
   update the location information frequently; other ones are in idle
   state so how to localize them is a little harder. This document
   proposes a scheme to localize the idle MN in the PMIPv6 network. When
   the MN is moving in the MD, the network can quickly obtain its
   location information to achieve the state synchronization and reduce
   the data forwarding delay.

INTERNET DRAFT       Localization for MN in PMIPv6         June 29, 2012


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a mobility management protocol on the
   basis of the network, which supplies the local mobility management
   for Mobile Nodes (MN). MN accesses the PMIPv6 network by cellular
   technology or Wi-Fi and maintains the idle state in most of the time.
   The registration procedure must be performed as MN moving to a new
   area even with idle state, which MAY cause unnecessary and extra
   signaling traffic. Furthermore, the mobility entity Mobile Access
   Gateway (MAG) is used to perform the related signaling on behalf of
   MN, so the frequent location update for MN will waste the network
   resource seriously and result in the scalability limitation for
   supporting a large number of MNs.

2.  Requirements and Terminology

2.1 Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2 Terminology

   In addition to the terminology defined in [RFC5213], the following
   terminology is also used:

   Local Management Center (LMC): LMC is located in the PMIPv6 network
   to manage the location information for the MN.

   Manage Domain (MD): MD is a network area network that cover the
   moving of the MN.

   MAG-a, MAG-b, MAG-c and MAG-d are MAGs located in the same MD and
   used by MN.


3.  Localization for Mobile Nodes

   For locating the idle MN as soon as possible, Local Management Center
   (LMC) is located in the Manage Domain (MD) to manage the states of
   the MN. The MAG is allocated to be the LMC when it is attached by MN
   which just turns into the idle state. LMC can be used to realize the
   localization and disperse the pressure of the LMA. For achieving the
   data forwarding quickly, the synchronized information between LMC and
   other MAGs includes the detailed flags such as MN-ID, MN-HNP and the
   address of LMC. When other MAGs receive the up-link data from the MN,
   LMC is used to forward the data on one side, and the PMIP binding

   procedure is activated on the other hand to setup the optimal path.
   When LMA forwards the down-link data for the MN, the data are first
   forwarded to LMC which initiates the localization. Then MAG forwards
   the data to the MN for responding the localization message and
   initiates the PMIP binding procedure to the LMA.

3.1 Procedure of Localization

   In order to present the procedure of localization, assuming that an
   MD is composed of four MAGs: MAG-a, MAG-b, MAG-c and MAG-d. The
   detailed process is shown as following:

   1) Firstly, MN attaches to MAG-a. As MAG-a does not maintain the
   state information of MN, it initiates the PMIP binding procedure and
   setup the bi-direction tunnel with LMA;

   2) During a period of lifetime, if no traffic data occurred in the
   MN, the state of MN is turned into idle in the subnet managed by MAG-
   a. Thus MAG-a proposes itself as the LMC of MN and sends the related
   information to other MAGs in the MD by localized indication;

   3) For the condition that MN is distinguished as an idle node when it
   moves to attach with MAG-b, PMIP operation does not have to be
   performed. The same procedure is executed when MN moves to MAG-c;

   4) When the data packets from the communication Corresponding Node
   (CN) are sent to MN, the first destination is LMA. Because LMA is
   binding to MAG-a, thus the data packets are redirected to MAG-a. At
   present MN has already moved to the other MAG, so MAG-a initiates the
   localization procedure. MAGs locating in MD receive the localization
   request messages and make the response according to the real
   conditions. For example, when MAG-b and MAG-d will ignore the request
   messages as the information of MN cannot be found in their subnet.
   MAG-c detects that MN is locating in its subnet and makes a
   responding to the request message. For one side MAG-a redirects the
   data packets to MAG-c for forwarding to MN; for the other side MAG-c
   initiates the PMIP binding procedure. LMA will update the binding
   state with MAG when receiving the PBU message;

   5) At present MN turns into the idle state and MAG-c is selected as
   new LMC and announces to other MAGs for updating the information of
   MN;

   6) Then MN moves to attach to MAG-d and be found with idle state. So
   PMIP operation does not have to be performed;

   7) When MN sends data packets to CN, MAG-d redirects the data packets
   to MAG-c and initiates the PMIP procedure to setup the bi-direction

   tunnel with LMA in the meanwhile.


3.2 Status Management

   In order to synchronize the state of MN among MAGs in MD, the
   original binding update list in PMIP should be extended as shown in
   Table 1:

                  +-----+-----+-------+-----+----------+
                  |MN-ID| HNP | State | LMC | Lifetime |
                  +-----+-----+-------+-----+----------+
                  | MN-1| HNP1|   1   | MAG1|    50s   |
                  +-----+-----+-------+-----+----------+
                  | MN-2| HNP2|   0   | MAG2|    50s   |
                  +-----+-----+-------+-----+----------+

                      Table 1: Binding Update List

   The state flag (value 1 indicates the idle state whereas 0 indicates
   the active state) is added in to the binding update list of MAG.
   Besides, LMC address and Lifetime flag are appended to manage the
   states and follow the rules:

   O  If MAG still does not get any packets from MN when the lifetime of
      the active MN is expired, the state of MN is turned into idle.

   O  The lifetime should be reset when MN received the data packets.

   O  When the lifetime of the idle MN is expired, the LMC address flag
      of the binding update list is null means that the current MAG is
      the LMC of the idle MN. Thus it's necessary for the MAG to
      communicate with LMA to update the location of MN and maintain the
      binding state of MN in LMA. The MAG needs to send the localization
      message to update the state of MN in other MAGs.

   O  When the lifetime of the idle MN is expired, the LMC address flag
      of the binding update list is not null means that the current MAG
      regards the state of MN turning into active and so deletes the
      corresponding entry.

   O  Current MAG makes sure that MN turns into the idle state and
      recommends itself as LMC of MN when no data packets occurred in
      the lifetime. Then MAG will initiate the state synchronization for
      MN.

3.3 Signaling Message

 


H. Jiang                   December 31, 2012                    [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT       Localization for MN in PMIPv6         June 29, 2012


   In the process of localization for MN, signaling messages which are
   proposed to fulfill the communication and information exchange are
   including the locating instruction message, the locating request
   message and the locating response message. The signaling interaction
   process meets the requirements as follows:

   O  LMC sends the locating instruction messages including MN-ID, MN-
      HNP, state information and its own address to other MAGs in the
      MD. When MN turns into the active state, LMC can send the locating
      instruction messages to notify other MAGs to delete the state
      information of MN.

   O  The locating request messages are sent by LMC to other MAGs in MD
      to turn the state of MN into active. MAGs should delete the state
      information of MN if without connection. For the MAGs having
      connection with MN, the state information should be turned into
      active. In the meanwhile those MAGs initiate the PMIP binding
      procedure and send the locating response message to LMC.

   O  The locating response messages sent from MAGs to LMC to give a
      response to the locating request messages. The detailed message
      includes the flags such as MN-ID, MN-HNP and the address of MAG.


3.4 Data Forwarding

   Data forwarding process can be divided into two aspects: the
   interaction between MAG and LMA as well as the interaction between
   MAG and LMC.

   O  Data forwarding between MAG and LMA should exactly follow the
      operation requirements of PMIPv6.

   O  The process of transmitting packets between MAG and LMC can be
      presented as follows:

      a) When receiving the up-link packets from the idle MN, current
         MAG (not as LMC) should redirect the data packets to LMC
         according to the binding update list and initiate the PMIPv6
         binding procedure. If MAG has received the PBA from LMA, it
         implies that PMIPv6 tunnel have been setup and the subsequent
         packets will be delivered by the tunnel. If MAG is used as LMC
         and receives the up-link data packets from the idle MN, MAG
         firstly turns the state information of MN into active and sends
         the locating instruction message to other MAGs to synchronize
         the state information of MN and forwards the data packets to
         LMA through the PMIPv6 tunnel.

INTERNET DRAFT       Localization for MN in PMIPv6         June 29, 2012


      b) When receiving the down-link packets from MN, LMA will forward
         the data packets through the tunnel to the MAG which is used to
         register in the network. The MAG must be used as LMC for MN. If
         MN is located in the subnet of LMC, LMC will forward the
         packets to MN and send the locating instruction messages to
         other MAGs to synchronize the state information of MN. If MN is
         locating in the subnet of other MAGs, LMC firstly locates the
         current attaching MAG of MN by sending the locating request
         message and then forwards the packets to the appropriate MAG
         when receiving the location response message.
