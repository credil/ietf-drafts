    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In the context of World Summit on the Information Society, the various
         participating Civil Society organizations jointly formulated a vision for
         shaping information societies for human needs <xref target="WSIS-CS"/>.
         That was in 2003. Since then, not much has happened to implement this
         vision. That needs to change now, because the situation is truly outrageous,
         see <xref target="Outrage"/>. Human society, the way in which people interact with each
         other, is more and more shaped by technology. However the decisions that shape this
         technology, and thereby our societies, are made mostly by a relatively narrow group of
         technologists and business interests without any significant consideration of global
         fairness or of the public interest. This violates the human right to democratic
         self-government of the peoples.</t>
      <t>The present proposal provides a practical mechanism to address these problems.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, it provides a way to realize the potential of information society to
         collaboratively develop strategies to address the pressing global challenges of humanity 
         such as to effectively limit greenhouse gas emissions and to empower people
         everywhere to overcome poverty. With regard to these challenges, the main problem is
         not that they are hard to solve. In fact there are good methods for strategy
         development available, see e.g. <xref target="Dettmer"/>. Rather, the problem is that
         our socioeconomic systems create strong incentives for corporations and governments to
         prioritize the pursuit of rather short-term economic goals. This is the same mechanism
         which also causes concerns of international fairness and human rights to be largely
         ignored in technology development.</t>
      <t>The solution proposed here is based on providing national parliaments with the
         necessary information for making good and strategically sound decisions.</t>
      <t>Parliaments already have the democratic legitimacy and the power to create legislation
         that imposes principles of conduct and creates incentives and disincentives.</t>
      <t>In addition, parliaments are well-designed for handling the hard task of seeking an
         appropriate balance between the various legitimate interests.</t>
      <t>Drawing inspiration from how the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) works, the
         present memo proposes a Wisdom Task Force with the purpose to develop, through an
         international multistakeholder rough consensus process, informative documents that
	 empower national parliaments to make good, well-informed decisions on information
         society issues, and other global issues that can effectively be addressed by means of
         information society methods and principles.</t>
      <t>The Wisdom Task Force is in many ways analogous, though complementary, to how
         inter-governmental cooperation can also benefit from enhancement through international
         multistakeholder dialogue, see <xref target="ECTF"/>.</t>
      <t>Here are some significant properties of the Wisdom Task Force proposal:
           <list style="symbols">
            <t>The WisdomTF proposal provides a way to implement coordinated global
               action independent of any intergovernmental negotiations. The mechanism for
               achieving this to determine, by means of rough consensus processes, possible
               action strategies that can be beneficial with regard to global public interest
               concerns. WisdomTF works to document what is known and what can plausibly be
               expected to be true about the advantages and disadvantages of different
               possible action strategies. In this way, WisdomTF empowers national parliaments
               to make well-informed decisions.</t>
            <t>WisdomTF is designed to complement existing fora for global policy dialogue, such
               as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), and IGF and benefit from synergies with
               these fora.</t>
            <t>The IETF principles of great inclusiveness of
               participation and decision-making by rough
               consensus are built upon to minimize the risks of
               powerful stakeholders gaining undue influence.</t>
            <t>In the realm of strategy development for global concerns it is not immediately
               obvious whether a good analogue for the IETF principle of "running code"
               exists. The WisdomTF proposal is inspired by the idea that
               an operationalized emphasis on human rights and on the vision for shaping
               information societies for human needs <xref target="WSIS-CS"/>, together
               with the principle of evidence based decision making 
               might provide similarly valuable guidance to how
               IETF technical standardization work is guided by the
               "running code" principle.</t>
           </list></t>

      <section title="Avoidance of Requirements Language">
        <t>This memo requests and recommends actions, but it does not
           define requirements. The use of the keywords of
           <xref target="RFC2119"/> describing requirement
           levels is therefore deliberately avoided.</t>

        <t>The Preparatory Working-Group described in
           <xref target="preparatory_wg"/>
           should not consider itself bound by any of the text in this
           memo, but rather it should feel free to reconsider and
           revise all of these recommendations.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="preparatory_wg" title="Preparatory Working-Group">
      <t>A Preparatory Working-Group of diverse stakeholders who all agree with the
         vision for shaping information societies for human needs <xref target="WSIS-CS"/>
         shall be convened to review and revise the contents of this memo.</t>
      <t>The work of this Preparatory Working-Group could begin with
         an in-person kick-off meeting which might be a one-day
         pre-event for the 2013 Internet Governance Forum.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="draft_scope" title="Draft Scope Statement for WisdomTF">
      <t>WisdomTF's scope of work shall be to empower national parliaments to make good,
         well-informed decisions on information society issues, and other global issues that can
         effectively be addressed by means of information society methods and principles.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="draft_rules" title="Draft Working Directives for WisdomTF">
      <t>This section provides a draft set of rules that should be
         carefully considered and revised by the WisdomTF Preparatory
         Working-Group, with the goal of creating a good initial
         Working Directives document for WisdomTF. The Preparatory
         Working-Group should at all times conduct its activities
         in accordance with what the current draft Working Directives
         say about how a WisdomTF Working-Group conducts its work. In
         this way, the Preparatory Working-Group will be conducting
         an initial test of how the draft directives work in practice,
         and any unreasonably burdensome rules can be recognized and
         fixed quickly.</t>

      <section anchor="values" title="Fundamental Values">
        <t>The fundamental values of the WisdomTF are the vision for shaping information
           societies for human needs <xref target="WSIS-CS"/> and that the human rights, as 
           defined in the various international human rights treaties,
           shall be upheld and implemented in every way possible.</t>
        <t>Evidence-based arguments on how these objectives can be
           best achieved shall be given precedence over more
           speculative arguments. WisdomTF has a number of Standing Documents
           providing guidance for the deliberative process; these shall
           be treated as incorporated by reference into these Directives.</t>
        <t>WisdomTF Working-Groups shall seek to provide, by means of the
           Request For Balance documents that they publish, the best
           possible information input to the decision-making processes of national
           parliaments. The Working-Groups shall seek to collect,
           by means of a balanced multistakeholder process,
           information about needs, concerns, cause-effect
           relationships, and available evidence, and to process 
	   all this to the extent possible into recommendations. The
           Working-Groups shall particularly pay attention to any
           relevant proceedings at existing fora for global policy dialogue, such
           as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) for Internet governance topics.
           At the very least, every Working-Group should be able to reach rough consensus on
           recommendations of the form "Public policy regarding topic
           X should take into consideration the following needs and
           concerns... ." Ideally (but with greater difficulty of
           reaching rough consensus) specific proposals for laws and
           others kinds of public policy decisions should be developed
           in a form that explicitly suggests a choice of options for
           possible choices of the balance between conflicting
           legitimate interests, together with information on what is
           known about the advantages and disadvantages (from the
           public interest perspective) of the different options.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="wg_rules" title="WG Working Procedures">
        <t>WisdomTF Working-Groups are generally free to define their own
           working procedures subject to the constraints that everyone
           without restriction must be welcome to participate as long
           as they participate constructively, and that decisions are
           made by the principle of rough consensus.</t>
        <t>Unless foreseen differently in the Terms of Reference of a
           Working Group, or the Working-Group decides otherwise, the
           WisdomTF Secretariat (see <xref target="secretariat"/>) shall
           use its discretion in setting up electronic communication
           infrastructure (such as an email mailing list) for the
           Working-Group, and in
           reminding participants, when this may be necessary, of the
           principles of professionally respectful conduct, or of
           international human rights law, or of the section on fundamental
           values in these directives (section <xref target="values"/>),
           or of the Terms of Reference of the particular Working-Group.</t>
        <t>If and only if such reminders prove ineffective, the
           Secretariat shall request the Committee
           (see <xref target="committee"/>) to decide an appropriate
	   sanction which may take the form of barring specific
           persons from participation in WisdomTF for a specific amount of
           time. The Committee can decide to impose such sanctions
           only by consensus or rough consensus but not by majority
           voting.</t>
        <t>All substantive discussion and decision-making of the Working-Groups shall be
           conducted exclusively via the Internet, in order to ensure fairness of participation
           also of people who do not have funding for international travel.</t>
        <t>All WisdomTF Working-Groups shall seek to interact with the
           broader professional community for the respective governance
           topics by active participation in the relevant global policy
           fora, such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) for Internet
           governance topics.</t>

        <t>The Secretariat shall process requests for publication of
        draft documents as Request For Balance documents as follows:</t>
        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Unless the Working-Group made the decision to publish the
             draft as a Request For Balance documents in the presence of a
             representative of the Secretariat, the Secretariat shall
             make reasonable inquiries to ensure that this decision
             has indeed been made by rough consensus and in accordance
             with the Terms of Reference of the Working-Group.</t>
          <t>The Secretariat shall verify that the Working-Group which
             made the request has Active status. (All Working-Groups
             have Active status initially, this status can change to
             Inactive in case of Sustaining Member disendorsements, see
             <xref target="wg_end_disendorse"/>.)</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="overall_endorsement"
          title="Overall Rough Consensus Endorsement">
       <t>The Working-Group which has made the decision to publish a
          Request For Balance document may instruct the Secretariat to
          issue a Consensus Call for Overall Rough Consensus Endorsement
          by WisdomTF.</t>
       <t>In this case the Secretariat shall communicate to all WisdomTF
          participants a request to review that Request For Balance
          document and communicate any objections within 90 days.</t>
       <t>If any objections are received, the Working-Group shall
          review the objections and decide whether it wants to revise
          the Request For Balance document.</t>
       <t>If no objections are received, or if the Working-Group
          otherwise decides not to revise the Request For Balance
          document, it may ask for a determination whether there is
          Overall Rough Consensus of WisdomTF. Overall Rough Consensus
          means that there must be rough consensus among each of the
          major stakeholder categories: Governments, civil society and
          industry. The determination of Overall Rough Consensus is
          made by the Committee of Sustaining Members, see
          <xref target="committee"/> below.</t>  
       <t>If it is determined that there is overall Overall Rough
          Consensus, the Secretariat shall add information to this
          effect to the concerned Request For Balance document.
          Furthermore, the Secretariat shall in this case issue a
          press release.</t>

      <section anchor="wg_start" title="WG Creation">
        <t>This section outlines the process for the formation of
           new WisdomTF Working-Groups. The objective of these rules
           is to make it as easy as reasonably possible to create
           such Working-Groups as soon as there is sufficient
           interest, while avoiding the creation of Working-Groups
           that would violate WisdomTF's fundamental values (see
           <xref target="values"/>) or that would not attract a
           sufficient number and variety of participants that output
           documents of high quality can be achieved.</t>
       <section anchor="wg_start_discuss"
                title="Initial Informal Discussion">
       <t>The WisdomTF Secretariat (see <xref target="secretariat"/>)
          shall make electronic communication infrastructure (such as
          an email mailing list) available for the purpose of
          informal discussion of ideas for new WisdomTF Working-Groups.</t>
       <t>The Secretariat shall use its discretion in reminding
          participants, when this may be necessary, of the values of
          WisdomTF including the principles of professionally respectful
          conduct and international human rights law.</t>
       <t>If such reminders prove insufficient for achieving a
          reasonably pleasant working atmosphere, the Secretariat
          shall request the Committee (see <xref target="committee"/>)
          to decide an appropriate sanction which may take the form of
          barring specific persons from participation in WisdomTF for a
          specific amount of time.  The Committee can decide to impose
          such sanctions only by consensus or rough consensus but not
          by majority voting.</t>
       </section>
       <section anchor="wg_start_endorse"
                title="Terms of Reference Endorsement">
         <t>After at least one month has elapsed since an idea
            has been initially proposed for information discussion,
            a WisdomTF Working-Group can be formed by three or more
            Sustaining Members endorsing Terms of Reference
            for the new Working-Group. The Terms of Reference shall
            specify objectives and guiding principles for the
            Working-Group.</t>

       <section anchor="wg_start_secretariat"
                title="Secretariat Actions">
         <t>The Secretariat shall verify that the Terms of Reference
            for the new Working-Group do not violate WisdomTF's
            fundamental values (see <xref target="values"/>), and that
            the Terms of Reference uphold these values at least as
            well as any other Working-Group addressing a very similar
            topic area for which the required Endorsement has been received
            earlier or up to two days later. For any Terms of Reference
            document which fails this test, the corresponding
            Working-Group shall not be created. The purpose of this
            rule is to ensure that if different groups of Sustaining
            Members propose different frameworks to address the same
            problem, so that one of them is clearly better from a
            human rights perspective, then precedence is appropriately
            given to the better framework.</t>
         <t>When it has been decided that establishment of the
            Working-Group is appropriate, the Secretariat shall set up
            appropriate communications infrastructure and add the new

      <section anchor="wg_end" title="WG Termination">
        <t>This section outlines the procedures for closing down a
           Working-Group. These procedures are intended to be used
           not only when the tasks of a Working-Group have been completed,
           but also if it becomes clear that progress is only
           possible by creating a new Working-Group on essentially
           the same topic but with Terms of Reference that provide
           more specific guidance which makes it easier to reach rough
           consensus.</t>

            number of Sustaining Members which endorse a particular
            Working-Group to drop below three, the status of the
            Working-Group changes to Inactive; as long as a
            Working-Group has Inactive status, it cannot decide to publish
            Request For Balance documents. The status changes to Active
            again if the number of endorsing Sustaining Members again
            increases to three or more.</t>

        <section anchor="committee" title="Committee of Sustaining Members">
        <t>Decisions of budget and staffing of the WisdomTF Secretariat
           shall be made by a Committee of Sustaining Members, as
           follows: From each of the four categories of
           Sustaining Members, up to five representatives may
           be delegated to the Committee, so that in total the
           committee consists of up to twenty persons.</t>
        <t>When in any category of Sustaining Members there are
           five or less Sustaining Members in the category, they
           shall each be invited to delegate a person to the
           Committee.</t>
        <t>When in any category of Sustaining Members there are
           more than five Sustaining Members, they shall attempt
           to agree among themselves on a way of selecting five
           representatives (for example by adopting a system of
           rotation). If they cannot agree and more than five want to
           be on the Committee, the Secretariat shall randomly choose,
           for a two-year term, five from among those who want to be
           on the Committee.</t>
        <t>The Committee shall attempt to make decisions by rough
           consensus. If this fails, decisions regarding the
           Secretariat may be taken at a meeting at which decision
           making by majority vote is allowed, which may be convened no
           earlier than 16 hours after the rough consensus process
           has failed.</t>
        <t>The Committee shall review any proposed changes to the WisdomTF
           Working Directives before publication as a Request For Balance
           document. It shall communicate any concerns to the
           Working-Group which is proposing changes to the Working
           Directives.</t>
        <t>The Committee is also responsible for the determination of
           Overall Rough Consensus, see <xref target="overall_endorsement"/>.
           The decision of determination of Overall Rough Consensus needs
           to be reached by rough consensus of the Committee; if the
           Committee fails to reach rough consensus, the Request For Balance
           document in question shall not be considered to have attained
           Overall Rough Consensus. This applies also to the Consensus
           Call in the context of changes to the WisdomTF Working Directives
           (see <xref target="directives_change"/> the difference being only
           that that Consensus Call involves only the Sustaining Members.</t>

        <section anchor="funding" title="Secretariat Funding">
         <t>Organizations which are interested in being Sustaining
         Industry Members shall make, for a specific number of years,
         a commitment that they are willing to contribute to funding
         the costs of the secretariat up to a specific amount.</t>
	 <t>Independently of whether this commitment is actually
	 called upon (see below) a maximal set of Sustaining
         Industry Members is chosen so that the yearly commitment
	 limit of each Sustaining Industry Members is greater or equal
	 than the budget of WisdomTF divided by the number of Sustaining
	 Industry Members.</t>
         <t>The Country Members as a group have the right to organize
         a way of funding WisdomTF which is independent of the Sustaining
         Industry Members. In that case the commitments of the Sustaining
         Industry Members are not called upon.</t>
         <t>Unless the Country Members make use of this right, the
         Secretariat and the Committee shall seek to ensure adequate
         funding by means of one or more of the following sources of
         funds: Voluntary contributions, grants from foundations and/or
         other grant-giving institutions, calling upon the Sustaining
         Industry Members to each contribute an equal amount.</t>
         <t>If there are no Sustaining Industry Members and the
         operations of the Secretariat have also not been adequately
         funded otherwise, the Secretariat shall have the authority to
         suspend some of its operations, according to its sole
         discretion.</t>
         <t>If the Committee intends to increase the budget of the
         Secretariat, the Committee shall, before making the decision
         to do so, secure commitments that sufficient funding will be
         made available. Furthermore, the Committee shall regularly
         assess the risk of available funding potentially dropping
         below the level of the current budget, and appropriate
         contingency plans shall be made.</t>

        <section anchor="directives_change"
                 title="Changes to the WisdomTF Working Directives">
         <t>If a WisdomTF Working-Group proposes a new version of the
         Directives, the Secretariat shall organize a Consensus Call
         among all Sustaining Members. If and only if there is rough
         consensus among each category of Sustaining Members for
         adoption of the revised Directives (as determined by the
         Committee, see <xref target="committee"/>), the Secretariat
         shall put them in force by publishing a Request For Balance
         document that gives the details about how the new version was
         adopted, and requests the new version of the Directives to be
         followed from now on.</t>
         <t>As ECTF Standing Documents are treated as incorporated by
         reference into these Directives, see <xref target="values"/>,
         the same requirement for a Consensus Call among all Sustaining
         Members applies also any changes to the set of Standing
         Documents.</t>
         <t>Country Members or International Organization Members may
         propose to make WisdomTF part of the UN or another existing or
         new treaty-based international organization. Such a proposal
         needs to be approved in the same way by rough consensus of
         all sustaining members of WisdomTF, in addition to whatever other
         steps may be required to create a new umbrella organization
         for WisdomTF.</t>

         <t>The Secretariat shall provide guidance to WisdomTF Working-Groups
         on how to self-organize on the basis of the principle of
         rough consensus decision-making.</t>
         <t>If it is brought to the attention of the Secretariat that
         a WisdomTF Working-Group has, for an continuous period of three
         or more months, failed to self-organize or otherwise failed
         to make any substantive progress towards its objectives,
         the Secretariat shall take the following steps: First the
         Secretariat shall verify that this is indeed the case. If
         yes, the Secretariat shall solicit nominations and
         self-nominations from among the Working-Group members of
         potential chairpersons who could organize the work of the
         Working-Group. If at least one person is nominated, the
         Secretariat shall appoint a chairperson. If no-one is
         nominated, the Secretariat shall dissolve the Working-Group.</t>
         <t>Working-Groups may also by means of a rough consensus
         decision request and empower the Secretariat to execute this
         process of chairperson appointment. The Secretariat shall
         honor such requests.</t>

      <t>This section provides draft Terms of Reference statements

      <t>The WisdomTF Preparatory Working-Group should consider and revise
         these texts in order to ensure that when WisdomTF is created, it
         will be easy to quickly also establish some worthwhile
         Working-Groups.</t>
      <t>The Preparatory Working-Group will not itself create these
         Working-Groups; rather it should publish, in addition to a
         Request For Balance document with recommended Working Directives,
         also a Request For Balance document recommending Terms of
         Reference for some Working-Groups. It should then be easy to
         create such Working-Groups by means of the procedure for
         WG Creation in the Working Directives
         (see <xref target="wg_start"/>).</t>

        the list of links on the website of the Civil Society Internet
        Governance Caucus <xref target="Links"/>), and publish, as a
        Request For Balance document, a consolidated version which
        provides reasonably detailed guidance on interpretation of
        human rights in the Internet context and on guiding principles
        for Internet governance to further human rights.</t>
        <t>Rationale: The current situation with so many independently

        in the form of one or more Request For Balance documents,
        appropriate recommendations regarding government activities
        aimed at the furtherance of culture.</t>
        <t>Rationale: As outlined in the Background Paper for that

        regard to practical realization of human rights, and discuss
        any suggestions for changes to the Working Directives. Whenever
        the WG has rough consensus that a change to the Working Directives
        may be desirable, the WG shall publish a Request For Balance
        document with revised Working Directives and an appendix that
        explains the rationale for the changes. This document shall
        not be phrased as definitely containing the new Working
        Directives, but rather as a request to the body of Sustaining
        Members of WisdomTF to adopt the proposed new Working Directives.
        (Adoption of such a revised Working Directives document is
        done by rough consensus among the Sustaining Members of
        WisdomTF.)</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Similarly to security considerations for technical systems
         (see <xref target="RFC3552">RFC&nbsp;3552</xref>), governance fora
         and processes need to be designed for robustness against
         attempts of "inappropriate usage" and "denial of service".
         In addition, the integrity of WisdomTF work with regard to
         human rights needs to be safeguarded.</t>

      <section anchor="inappropriate_usage" title="Inappropriate Usage">
        <t>Clearly WisdomTF needs rules governing the interaction between
	  participants. In the absence of appropriate rules,
	  participation in WisdomTF cannot be expected to be effective,
          time-efficient and a pleasant experience.</t>
        <t>These rules need to be designed so that bona
	  fide well-intentioned newcomers with reasonably good
	  communication skills will be able to quickly learn how to 
	  participate effectively, while on the other hand there
	  need to be effective disincentives that discourage and
	  penalize disruptive and non-constructive behavior.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="denial_of_service" title="Denial of Service">
        <t>It is particularly important to avoid vulnerability of WisdomTF
          and its working-groups to the political equivalent of what
          is called "denial of service" attacks in the technical realm:
	  It must not be possible for beneficiaries of the status quo
          (who may fear a potential loss of power) to disrupt discussions
          that could lead to new forms of enhanced cooperation.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="human_rights" title="Human Rights">
        <t>The rules of WisdomTF need to ensure that all recommendations
           published by its working-groups are designed to uphold the
           fundamental principles which are internationally recognized
           as human rights, and to improve as much as possible the
           practical ability of people everywhere to enjoy their human
           rights.</t>
