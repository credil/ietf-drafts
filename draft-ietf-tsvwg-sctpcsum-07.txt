Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) currently uses an Adler-32
checksum.  For small packets Adler-32 provides weak detection of
errors.  This document changes that checksum and updates SCTP to use a
32 bit CRC checksum.

This document is a product of the Transport Area Working Group of the
IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
