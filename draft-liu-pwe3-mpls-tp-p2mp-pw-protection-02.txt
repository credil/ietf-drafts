                 p2mp pw protection for MPLS-TP network
              draft-liu-pwe3-mpls-tp-p2mp-pw-protection-02

Abstract

   The requirements of MPLS-TP in RFC 5654 include a requirement(R63)
   that requires MPLS-TP MUST be possible to provide protection for
   MPLS-TP data plane without any IP forwarding capability and control
   plane.If applying 1:1 protection for the p2mp traffic in rfc6718 , it
   must have a return path to coordinate the switch state to select the
   same path to receive and send the traffic packet.As there exists the
   above problem statement,This document describes a kind of protection
   solution to recovery and protect the p2mp traffic under the failure
   condition.


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) /
   International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
   defined by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft   p2mp pw protection for mpls-tp network    December 2012


1.  Problem statement

   According to MPLS-TP requirement(RFC 5654), It requires that MPLS-TP
   data plane is independent of control plane and IP forwarding
   capability.  So it means that MPLS-TP data plane can still work
   without control plane and any IP forwarding capability.It must be
   essential for unidiretional path including p2p or p2mp path to set up
   a return path between any leaf node and root node .  So it costs more
   configuration and maintenece .  While this document describes a kind
   of protection solution for p2mp traffic without return path, IP
   forwarding capability and control plane.

Internet-Draft   p2mp pw protection for mpls-tp network    December 2012


3.  protection solution

   This section will describe a protection solution for p2mp pw
   path,which uses one leaf node as protector node of another leaf
   node.The two leaf nodes protect each other.in addtion, In order to be
   easy to access to CE node, It should set up backup node to directly
   access to CE node.  If the backup node is still a leaf node of the
   p2mp pw path , the protector node and the backup node are the same
   node. in addtion, A bidirectional p2p pw should be configurated
   between the protected node, the backup node and the protector node
   .Just as the following figure 1:

                                 Figure 1


   LER0 is the root node of a p2mp pw, LER1 and LER3 are leaf nodes of
   the p2mp pw.  LER2 is backup node for LER1 and LER3.  When protected
   node LER1 or LER3 has the failure, its backup node LER2 will replace
   a protected node LER1 or LER3 to transmit the protected p2mp traffic
   packet to CE1 or CE3.  If CE1 or CE3 detects a failure on its working
   access link(*), it will select protection access link(+) to receive
   the traffic.Just as the following figure 2,.

                                 Figure 2


   If LER1 has a failure, CE1 and LER2 MUST detect the failure by OAM or
   other checking mechanism.  Then LER2 will notify its protector node
   LER3 of the failure by pw status message[1].  When LER3 receives the
   failure status message, it will begin to duplicate the traffic packet
   of the p2mp pw to transmit to LER2 by pre-configured p2p protection
   pw.  Then LER2 sends the traffic packet of the p2mp pw to CE1 by the
   protection access link(LER2-CE1).At the same time, When CE1 detects
   the failure on its working access link(LER1-CE1), it must switch to
   receive the traffic packet from its protection access link(LER2-CE1).

   If only a failure is detected on the working access link, such as
   access link(LER1-CE1) in the following figure 3:

   when CE1 and LER1 detect a failure on the working access link(LER1-
   CE1), LER1 firstly notify its backup node LER2 of the egress AC
   failure by pw status message[1].  Then LER1 will send the protected
   traffic packet to LER2 by protection p2p pw between LER1 and LER2.
   LER2 will transmit the traffic packet to CE1 by its protection access
   link(LER2-CE1).  At the same time, CE1 will switch to receive the
   traffic packet from its protection access link(LER2-CE1).

   When a leaf node detects a failure on its working pw , it will notify
   the failure of its backup node or protector node by pw status
   message[1].  So that its backup node will transmit the protected
   traffic packet to the protected node.For example, The following
   figure 4 describes the protection scenario.
