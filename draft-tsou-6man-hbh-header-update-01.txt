Abstract

   The Hop-by-Hop Options header is used to convey optional information
   that must be examined by every node along a packet's delivery path.
   This document updates RFC2460, removing the requirement that source
   nodes must process the Hop-by-Hop extension header, on the basis that
   it imposes a performance impact with no advantages.

Internet-Draft            hop-by-hop EH update                March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Hop-by-Hop Options extension header is used to convery
   information that must be examined by all nodes along the path.
   [RFC2460] requires processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options extension
   header in all nodes along the packet delivery path.  However, this is
   not really necessary for source node, and imposes a performance
   penalty on the source node when such packets are employed.

   Section 2 describes the Processing of Hop-by-hop Options header.
   Section 3 formally updates the [RFC2460] such that the aforementioned
   penalty on the source node is eliminated.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Processing of Hop-by-Hop Option Header

   Section 4 of [RFC2460] states that the Hop-by-Hop Options header must
   be examined and processed by every node along a packet's delivery
   path, including the source and destination nodes.

   The above requirement means that a node originating the packet that
   contains a Hop-by-Hop Extension header will have to process that
   header.  Since source node is the one inserting the header in the
   first place, there does not seem to be any advantages in such
   requirement, but otherwise represents a performance penalty.

   Some applications in the source node, e.g. firewall, may check the
   network packets before they are sent out, the hop-by-hop option
   header may be processed, which is optional.

   As of the time of this writing, two options (other than the padding
   options) have been specified for the Hop-by-Hop Options extension
   header:

   Router Alert Option      This option is defined in [RFC2711],
                            intended for applications like MLD, RSVP,
                            etc.

   Jumbo Payload Option     This option is defined in [RFC2675], and
                            used to convey IPv6 payloads larger than
                            2^16 bytes.

   In the above two cases, the source node does not need to process the
   Hop-By-Hop options extension header.


3.  Updating RFC2460

   This document updates [RFC2460] as follows:

   The Hop-by-Hop Options header MUST be examined and processed by every
   node along a packet's delivery path (including the destination
   nodes), except for the source node.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require any IANA actions.


5.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce new security issues.
