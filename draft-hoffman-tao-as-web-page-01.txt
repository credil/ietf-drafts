Abstract

   Discussion of the "Tao of the IETF" during 2012 made it clear that
   many people want the document published only as a web page, not as an
   RFC that needs to be periodically updated.  This document specifies
   how the Tao will be published as a web page.

Internet-Draft                 Tao as Web                      June 2012


1.  Introduction

   The "Tao of the IETF" ("Tao") has traditionally been published as an
   RFC.  It has been RFCs 1391, 1539, 1718, 3160; it is currently
   [RFC4677].  There is now a strong desire in the IETF community to
   turn the Tao into a web page that can be edited more easily than an
   RFC.

   During the discussion that lead to this document, there were many
   proposals for how the Tao as a web page should be published and
   edited.  Some wanted just a web page; some wanted a web page and
   periodic snapshots as RFCs; some wanted a wiki that could be easily
   edited by anyone in the IETF community, with a master editor who
   would revert bad edits; some wanted a wiki with a more limited group
   of contributors.

   This document contains the procedure agreed to by the IESG.  The Tao
   has traditionally been an IETF consensus document, which means that
   the IESG has had the final say about what the Tao contained before it
   was sent to the RFC Editor.  Thus, the IESG should have final say for
   what the Tao says when it is a web page.


2.  Procedure for Publishing and Editing the Tao

   The Tao will be published at <http://www.ietf.org/tao.html> and
   <https://www.ietf.org/tao.html>.

   The Tao will be edited by one person who is chosen by the IESG.  The
   editor of the Tao accepts proposed changes and additions from anyone
   in the IETF community.  The editor of the Tao decides which proposed
   changes should be submitted to the IESG for the next version of the
   Tao.

   The editor of the Tao will occasionally submit a new version of the
   Tao to the IESG for its approval.  The editor will publish the
   propsed changes in a version at
   <http://www.ietf.org/tao-possible-revision.html>, and there will be
   discussion of the changes on an open, Tao-specific mailing list.  The
   IESG may accept as many of the proposed changes as it wishes.  The
   IESG will then submit the changed version to the IETF Secretariat for
   publication on the IETF web page at the URLs given above.

   Each version of the Tao will have a visible timestamp near the
   beginning of the document.  All published versions will be archived
   using URLs of the form <http://www.ietf.org/tao-YYYYMMDD.html>.
