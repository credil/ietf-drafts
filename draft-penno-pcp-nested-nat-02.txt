                PCP Support for Nested NAT Environments
                     draft-penno-pcp-nested-nat-02

Abstract

   Nested NATs or multi-layer NATs are already widely deployed.  They
   are characterized by two or more NAT devices in the path of packets
   from the subscriber to the Internet.  Moreover, NAT devices current
   deployed are PCP unaware and It is assumed that NAT aware PCP devices
   will take a long time to be rolled out.  Therefore in order to lower
   the adoption barrier of PCP and make it work for current deployed
   networks, this document proposes a few mechanisms for PCP-enabled
   applications to work through nested NATs with varying levels of PCP
   protocol support.

1.  Introduction

   Nested NATs are widely deployed and come in different topology
   flavors.  It could be a home subscriber which has an ISP provided NAT
   CPE chained with another personal NAT router.  It could be an ISP
   provided CPE chained with a CGN.

   An example of the use of the proposed options is illustrated in the
   following figure where there is a NAT in the path between the PCP
   Client and the PCP Server.

                  webcam-------+
                               |
               +----------+    |    +----+         +----------+
               |PCP Client|====+====|NAT1|=========|PCP Server|
               +----------+         +----+         |   NAT2   |
                                                   +----------+

   An example of instructing mappings in the PCP Server is as follows:

   o  NAT1 is detected in the path between the PCP Client and the PCP
      Server owing to the use of the RCEIVED_PORT Option and returned
      perceived IP address in PCP response;

   o  After learning about that NAT, the PCP Client uses UPnP IGD,
      NAT-PMP or manual configuration to interact with NAT1 and
      open the necessary port on NAT1 (e.g., IP address= IPx, port=X);

   o  The PCP Client then sends PCP message to the PCP Server,
      indicating IPx and X as the internal IP address and port.  The PCP
      Server opens pinhole towards IPx and X.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses PCP terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]].

1.2.  Problem Statement

   The current NAT deployed devices will take years to be replaced or
   upgraded to become PCP aware.  Moreover, nested NATs are common and
   come in a variety of flavors (examples below).  Therefore, as
   applications become PCP enabled, it is important that they can work
   through nested NAT networks as is, without requiring infrastructure
   changes.  From the point of view of a PCP-enabled application running
   on an end host, the core problem is common across different nested
   NAT topologies: how to install PCP mappings in a nested NAT scenario
   where the different NATs in the path have varying level of PCP
   protocol support.

1.3.  Scope

   This proposal considers the discovery of the PCP Server out of scope.
   Nonetheless, it s a critical piece of PCP deployment in service
   provider networks.


2.  PCP Nested NAT Methods

   There are a few methods to make PCP work through nested NATs.  They
   differ mainly based on the level of support that can be expected from

   intermediate NATs, which can be:

   o  PCP and UPnP unaware or disabled

   o  PCP Server

   o  UPnP Server

   o  PCP Proxy

   The next sections discuss each scenario on the basis of protocol
   support on intermediate NATs.

2.1.  PCP and UPnP unaware Intermediate NATs

   This method will most likely be used by PCP clients in nested NAT
   environments while PCP Proxy support in not ubiquitous.  It assumes
   no UPnP or PCP Proxy support on intermediate NATs.  This proposal
   leverages the current behavior of PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] which
   allows a PCP Client and Server to detect intervening nested NATs.
   The PCP Server uses the information on the outer IP and PCP headers
   to detect and install a proper NAT mapping and return the source IP:
   port from the IP header on the PCP response.  It does not assume any
   change to current deployed NATs.

   1.  The PCP Client sends the MAP request as it normally would without
       any changes.

   2.  As the message goes through one (or more) PCP-unaware NAT, the
       source IP:port of the IP header will change accordingly

   3.  The PCP Server compares the PCP Client IP:port in the PCP header
       with the source IP:port of the IP header

   4.  If these are different, the server knows that the PCP message
       went through a PCP-unaware NAT.  Therefore it installs a mapping
       directed to the source IP address found on the IP header and
       internal port of the PCP header.

2.2.  PCP Server intermediate NAT

   If the intermediate NAT implements a PCP Server (but not a Proxy), a
   two-step iterative process is needed in order to install PCP PEER
   mappings for the PCP control message itself followed by another PCP
   mapping for the data path.  If the PCP client relies on nested NAT
   detection the first step is not needed.  It is assumed that before
   the PCP MAP request to the CGN the client would install the following
   map on the NAT Home Gateway: (192.168.0.2, 40000) <- (10.0.0.2,
   40000).  The internal port that the server listens on does not
   necessarily needs to be 40000, it could be different than the
   internal port used between the CGN and CPE.

   The drawback of this technique is that there is no obvious way for
   the PCP Client to know the PCP Servers downstream.  One possibility
   is for each PCP Server in the path to return the address of the
   upstream PCP Server to the PCP Client.

2.3.  UPnP enabled intermediate NAT

   This scenario is very similar to the PCP Server intermediate NAT, but
   the CPE implements a UPnP Server instead of PCP Server.  The
   mechanics are the same with the difference that first PEER message to
   setup the PCP Control messages mapping is substituted by its UPnP
   equivalent.

2.4.  PCP Proxy Intermediate NAT

   This method assumed that the intermediate NATs implement a PCP Proxy
   function.  There are two non-exclusive types of proxy functions:
   interception (ALG) and server-client based.  In the interception case
   the PCP Proxy intercepts PCP messages destined to a PCP Server
   downstream, modifies IP, UDP and PCP headers, allocates a mapping and
   send them to the downstream PCP Server.  Ideally if the interception
   PCP Proxy also implements a PCP server it would let the PCP Client
   know of its existence in a PCP response through an option (TBD) and
   henceforth the PCP Client would start directing messages to it.

   In the server-client scenario the PCP Client sends PCP messages to
   the proxy which acts as both PCP Server and Client.  This proxy in
   turn will terminate the PCP request and generate a new one acting as

   a PCP Client to its own PCP Server.  Therefore mappings are installed
   in all NAT devices in a recursive manner.  This is the recommended
   method since its does not need a special discovery procedure and
   works with any number of NATs.  More information about this method
   can be found in [I-D.bpw-pcp-proxy].

   TBD


3.  RECEIVED_SOURCE_PORT Option

   This option (Code TBA, Figure 1) is used by a PCP Server to indicate
   in a PCP response the source port of PCP messages received from a PCP
   Client.  Together with the IP Address of the PCP Client conveyed in
   the common PCP header, a PCP Client uses this information to detect
   whether a NAT is present in the path to reach its PCP Server.

   A PCP Client MAY include this option to learn the port number as
   perceived by the PCP Server.  When this option is received by the PCP
   Server, it uses the source port of the received PCP request to set
   the Received Port.

4.  SCOPE Option

   The Scope Option (Code TBA, Figure 2) is used by a PCP Client to
   indicate to the PCP Server the scope of the flows that will use a
   given mapping.  This object is meant to be used in the context of
   cascaded PCP Servers/NAT levels.  Two values are defined:

                              Value Meaning
                              ----- --------
                               0x00 Internet
                               0x01 Internal

   When 0x00 value is used, the PCP Proxy MUST propagate the mapping
   request to its upstream PCP Server.  When 0x01 value is used, the
   mapping is to be instantiated only in the first PCP-controlled
   device; no mapping is instantiated in the upstream PCP-controlled
   device.

   When no Scope Option is included in a PCP message, this is equivalent
   to including a Scope Option with a scope value of "Internet".

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] must be
