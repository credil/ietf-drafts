    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a process implementing Essential Connected Dominating Set (E-CDS) [RFC 5614] for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs). E-CDS transforms 2-hop neighborhood topology information for routers to dynamically perform relay self election to form CDS.  The ECDS-MIB, an extension to SMF-MIB [draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-03], reports state information, performance metrics, and notifications. In addition to configuration, this additional state and performance information is useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.</t>
    </section>


    <section title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework">
      <t>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>E-CDS provides method for implementing selection of Multipoint Relay  nodes that define an estimate of the Minimum Connected Dominating Set (MCDS) flooding.  The MCDS  provides an efficient and complete  coverage of the nodes comprising the MANET.  The packet forwarding rules does not require knowledge of previous hop discovery.  Routers that run Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) and have E-CDS enabled can be mixed with routers that run SMF [RFC6621] and Classic Flooding (CF) enabled without a problem, even those are not participating in Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130].  Another benefit is that packets opportunistically received from non-symmetric neighbors may be forwarded without compromising flooding efficiency or correctness. Furthermore, multicast sources not participating in NHDP may freely inject their traffic and any neighboring E-CDS relays will properly forward the traffic. The E-CDS based relay set selection algorithm is based upon [RFC5614].</t>

      <section title="ECDS-MIB Management Model">
        <t>As mentioned in Overview section, ECDS-MIB is an extension to SMF-MIB.  Meaning, the overall architecture is based on SMF.</t>

      <t>The Relay Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA) can rely upon topology information gotten from the MANET NHDP, from the specific MANET routing protocol running on the node, or from Layer 2 information passed up to the higher layer protocol processes.  As for ECDS, nodes, which select themselves as relays using router identifier and a nodal metric known as "Router Priority" for all one-hop and two-hop neighbors.  Differing Router Priority can result in different CDSs for a given network.</t>
