Internet-Draft            Wi-Fi user experience             October 2012


1.  Introduction

   for the smart phones and other smart terminals that equiped with both
   Wi-Fi and cellular network interface, there are many factors that can
   affect the user experience.  Normally, there is no mobility support
   between the Wi-Fi network and the cellular network.

2.  Problem analysis of Wi-Fi/cellular network

   Fast recovery of network connection

   It is a common scenario for a smart phone/smart device that
   originally uses the cellular network connection then offload the
   traffic to Wi-Fi network.  In this case, it is very important for the
   Wi-Fi network connection can be established in a timely manner.

   As an example, we can consider a user is using his smartphone to
   watch a online video.  The user use 3G network when he is in the bus.
   After he get off from the bus and enter his home, he prefer to use
   Wi-Fi over 3G, then he turn on his smart phone's Wi-Fi switch.  At
   this moment, the following procedure would happen before he can use
   the Wi-Fi connection:

   The Wi-Fi device discover the network and select an access point to
   associate.

   Authentication: depends on the authentication mechanism the Wi-Fi
   network used, the Wi-Fi device finish the authentication procedure.

   IP address allocation and other IP layer paramters configuration.
   After the successful authentication, Wi-Fi network allocates an IP
   address for the smart phone.  Along with the IP address
   configuration, other IP layer parameters, such as default gateway/DNS
   would also be configured.

   Note: the actual sequence of IP address configuration and
   authentication depends on the specific authentication mechanism being
   used.

   After the above procedure, the Wi-Fi network is ready for
   communiction.  From the application's perspective, the IP address has
   been changed during this handoff, the application need to detect the
   IP address changing in a timely manner then re-establish the
   connection using he new IP address.

   In the above use case analysis, the crucial point is that the Wi-Fi
   network connection should be established in an timely manner, thence
   can reduce the user experience interruption. for example, when the

   user is browsing a website, after the handoff, if the brower can
   refresh the webpage automatically or even refreshed manually by the
   user, the user experience interruption would be minimized.
   Conversely, if the Wi-Fi network connection is not established in
   time, the user would see an error page after refresh the broswer.

3.  Potential optimization

   Following t the optential optimization work that could be done in
   IETF:

   1.  Fast IP address configuration

   Operator deployed Wi-Fi network usually use DHCP for IPv4 address
   auto configuration.  There is a Rapid Commit Option for DHCP that
   defined in RFC 4039.  The following figure is the procedure of DHCP
   rapid commit option.  Different from normall DHCP procedure, with the
   rapid commit option, the IPv4 address configuration will need only
   one roundtrip.  The DHCP rapid commint option could be used for fast
   IP adddress configuration.

                       Rapid Commit Option for DHCP

   Another way to improve the speed of IP address configuration is to
   bind the IP address configuration procedure into the 802.11 MAC
   layer.  IEEE 802.11ai working group is currently working on this
   direction.  The goal of 802.11ai is to achieve the "Fast Initial Link
   Setup".  The design goal of 802.11ai is to minimize the link setup
   delay of 802.11 network to less than 100ms.  Current link setup delay
   usually spend several seconds.  This is not acceptable to achieve the
   seamless user experience during the handover from cellular network to
   Wi-Fi network. 802.11ai is still under development and it is could be
   one potential building block of the fast Wi-Fi recovery solution.

   2.  Fast authentication, that may be combine with other network
   configuration procedures to decrease the delay

Internet-Draft            Wi-Fi user experience             October 2012


   IEEE 802.11ai also deal with the fast authentication problem.  The
   basic idea is to bind the authentication procedure in the MAC layer
   protocol procedures to reduce the roundtrip needed by authentication
   and parallelize the different procedures needed during the link
   setup.

   3.  Fast network connectivity testing

   In some cases, the finish of link layer setup and IP address
   configuration does not mean that the Wi-Fi network is ready for use.
   For example, the widely deployed portal based Wi-Fi authentication
   can allocate IP address to the user before authentication, but the
   user can not get Internet access until input the user name and
   password in an redirect authentication web page.  In this scenario,
   only the application layer can detect the usability of the Wi-Fi
   network.  As an example, Apple device will try to send http Get
   request to the url: "http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html"
   to test the usability of current connected Wi-Fi network.  If the
   response of this http Get request is "Success", then the Apple device
   will know that the current connected Wi-Fi network is ready for use.
   This solution is workable for a specific vendor but is not a general
   solution for the Internet.  Some IETF work may needed to define a
   general protocol to test the usability of the Wi-Fi network.

   4.  Virtual Interface

   Another key point of the Wi-Fi fast recovery solution is the virtual
   interface in the terminal.  In current IP stack implementation, if
   the physical network status changes, the TCP and other IP layer
   connection usually will be broken.  For example, if the user handover
   from 3G network to Wi-Fi, even the IP address allocated by the two
   network is the same IP address, the application's network connection
   will still be broken due to the physical network interface changes.
   This problem could be solved using virtual interface.  All the
   application's network connection in the terminal will bind to the
   virtual interface.  The virtual interface have all the IP layer
   configuration of the physical network interface.  All the
   application's data traffic will first send to the virtual interface,
   then the virtual interface will map the traffic to the actual
   physical interface.  By this appraoch, the physical network handover
   event will not interupt the application's network connection.

4.  Conclution

   This document discusses the problem and potential solutions for fast
   Wi-Fi network recovery.  Some of the building block of the fast Wi-Fi
   network recovery may need standardization work in IETF.
