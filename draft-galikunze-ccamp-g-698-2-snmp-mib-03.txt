   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in TCP/IP- based
   internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing Optical
   parameters associated with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
   systems in accordance with the optical interface defined in G.698.2
   [ITU.G698.2]

   Black Link approach allows supporting an optical transmitter/receiver
   pair of one vendor to inject a DWDM channel and run it over an
   optical network composed of amplifiers, filters, add-drop
   multiplexers from a different vendor.  From architectural point of
   view, the "Black Link" is a set of pre-configured/qualified network
   connections between the G.698.2 reference points S and R. The black
   links will be managed at the edges (i.e. the transmitters and
   receivers attached to the S and R reference points respectively) for
   the relevant parameters specified in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2], G.798
   [ITU.G798], G.874 [ITU.G874], and the performance parameters
   specified G.7710/Y.1701 [ITU-T G.7710] and and G.874.1 [ITU.G874.1].

   The G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] provides optical parameter values for
   physical layer interfaces of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
   (DWDM) systems primarily intended for metro applications which
   include optical amplifiers.  Applications are defined in G.698.2
   [ITU.G698.2] using optical interface parameters at the single-channel
   connection points between optical transmitters and the optical
   multiplexer, as well as between optical receivers and the optical
   demultiplexer in the DWDM system.  This Recommendation uses a
   methodology which does not specify the details of the optical link,
   e.g.  the maximum fibre length, explicitly.  The Recommendation
   currently includes unidirectional DWDM applications at 2.5 and 10
   Gbit/s (with 100 GHz and 50 GHz channel frequency spacing).  Work is
   still underway for 40 and 100 Gbit/s interfaces.  There is
   possibility for extensions to a lower channel frequency spacing.
   This document specifically refers to the "application code" defined
   in the G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] plus few optical paramenter not included
   in the application code definition.

   This draft refers and supports also the draft-kunze-g-698-2
   -management-control-framework

   The building of an SNMP MIB describing the optical parameters defined
   in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] G.798 [ITU.G798], G.874 [ITU.G874],
   parameters specified G.7710/Y.1701 [ITU-T G.7710] allows the
   different vendors and operator to retrieve, provision and exchange
   information related to Optical blak links in a standardized way.
   This facilitates interworking in case of using optical interfaces
   from different vendors at the end of the link.

   The MIB, reporting the Optical parameters and their values,
   characterizes the features and the performances of the optical
   components and allow a reliable black link design in case of
   multivendor optical networks.

   Although RFC 3591 [RFC3591] describes and defines the SNMP MIB of a
   number of key optical parameters, alarms and Performance Monitoring,
   a more complete description of optical parameters and processes can
   be found in the ITU-T Recommendations.  Appendix A of this document
   provides an overview about the extensive ITU-T documentation in this
   area.  The same considerations can be applied to the RFC 4054
   [RFC4054]

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] In
   the description of OIDs the convention: Set (S) Get (G) and Trap (T)
   conventions will describe the action allowed by the parameter.

4.  Overview

   Figure 1 shows a set of reference points, for the linear "black link"
   approach, for single-channel connection (Ss and Rs) between
   transmitters (Tx) and receivers (Rx).  Here the DWDM network elements
   include an OM and an OD (which are used as a pair with the opposing
   element), one or more optical amplifiers and may also include one or
   more OADMs.

4.1.  Optical Parameters Description

   The black links are managed at the edges, i.e. at the transmitters
   (Tx) and receivers (Rx) attached to the S and R reference points
   respectively.  The parameters that could be managed at the black link
   edges are specified in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] section 5.3 referring the
   "application code" notation

   The definitions of the optical parameters are provided below to
   increase the readability of the document, where the definition is
   ended by (G) the parameter can be retrieve with a GET, when (S) it
   can be provisioned by a SET, (G,S) can be either GET and SET.

   To support the management of these parameters, the SNMP MIB in RFC
   3591 [RFC3591] is extended with a new MIB module defined in section 6
   of this document.  This new MIB module includes the definition of new
   configuration table of the OCh Layer for the parameters at Tx (S) and
   Rx (R).

4.1.1.  Rs-Ss Configuration

   The Rs-Ss configuration table allows configuration of Wavelength,
   Power and Application codes as described in [ITU.G698.2] and G.694.1
   [ITU.G694.1]
   This parameter report the current Transceiver Output power, it can be
   either a setting and measured value (G, S) NEED TO DISCUSS ON THIS.

   Wavelength Value (see G.694.1 Table 1):
      This parameter indicates the wavelength value that Ss and Rs will
      be set to work (in THz) se in particular Section 6/G.694.1 (G, S).

   Vendor Transceiver Class:
      Other than specifying all the Transceiver parameter, it might be
      convenient for the vendors to summarize a set of parameters in a
      single proprietary parameter: the Class of transceiver.  The
      Transceiver classification will be based on the Vendor Name and
      the main TX and RX parameters (i.e. Trunk Mode, Framing, Bit rate,
      Trunk Type, Channel Band, Channel Grid, Modulation Format, Channel
      Modulation Format, FEC Coding, Electrical Signal Framing at Tx,
      Minimum maximum Chromatic Disperion (CD) at Rx, Maximum
      Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) at Rx, Maximum differential
      group delay at Rx, Loopbacks, TDC, Pre-FEC BER, Q-factor,
      Q-margin,etc.).  If this parameter is used, the MIB parameters
      specifying the Transceiver characteristics may not be significant
      and the vendor will be responsible to specify the Class contents
      and values.  The Vendor can publish the parameters of its Classes
      or declare to be compatible with published Classes.(G) Optional
      for compliance. (not mentioned in G.698)

   Number of Vendor Transceiver Class Supported
      This parameter indicates the number of Vendor Transceiver codes
      supported by this interface (G).

   Single-channel application codes (see G.698.2):
      This parameter indicates the transceiver application code at Ss
      and Rs as defined in [ITU.G698.2] Chapter 5.4 - this parameter can
      be called Optical Interface Identifier OII as per [draft-
      martinelli-wson-interface-class] (G).

4.2.  Use of ifTable

   This section specifies how the MIB II interfaces group, as defined in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is used for the link ends of a black link.  Only
   the ifGeneralInformationGroup will be supported for the ifTable and
   the ifStackTable to maintain the relationship between the OCh and OPS
   layers.  The OCh and OPS layers are managed in the ifTable using
   IfEntries that correlate to the layers depicted in Figure 1.

   For example, a device with TX and/or RX will have an Optical Physical
   Section (OPS) layer, and an Optical Channel (OCh) layer.  There is a
   one to n relationship between the OPS and OCh layers.

   EDITOR NOTE: Reason for changing from OChr to OCh: Work on revised
   G.872 in the SG15 December 2011 meeting agreed to remove OChr from
   the architecture and to update G.709 to account for this
   architectural change.  The meeting also agreed to consent the revised
   text of G.872 and G.709 at the September 2012 SG15 meeting.

   Figure 2 In the following figures, opticalChannel and
   opticalPhysicalSection are abbreviated as och and ops respectively.

   Each opticalChannel IfEntry is mapped to one of the m
   opticalPhysicalSection IfEntries, where m is greater than or equal to
   1.  Conversely, each opticalTransPhysicalSection port entry is mapped
   to one of the n opticalChannel IfEntries, where n is greater than or
   equal to 1.

   The design of the Optical Interface MIB provides the option to model
   an interface either as a single bidirectional object containing both
   sink and source functions or as a pair of unidirectional objects, one
   containing sink functions and the other containing source functions.

   If the sink and source for a given protocol layer are to be modelled
   as separate objects, then there need to be two ifTable entries, one
   that corresponds to the sink and one that corresponds to the source,
   where the directionality information is provided in the configuration
   tables for that layer via the associated Directionality objects.  The
   agent is expected to maintain consistent directionality values
   between ifStackTable layers (e.g., a sink must not be stacked in a
   1:1 manner on top of a source, or vice-versa), and all protocol
   layers that are represented by a given ifTable entry are expected to
   have the same directionality.

   When separate ifTable entries are used for the source and sink
   functions of a given physical interface, association between the two
   uni-directional ifTable entries (one for the source function and the
   other for the sink functions) should be provided.  It is recommended

   that identical ifName values are used for the two ifTable entries to
   indicate such association.  An implementation shall explicitly state
   what mechanism is used to indicate the association, if ifName is not
   used.

4.2.1.  Use of ifTable for OPS Layer

       Only the ifGeneralInformationGroup needs to be supported.

       ifTable Object      Use for OTN OPS Layer

     ifIndex           The interface index.

                       Physical Section (OPS)

     ifType            opticalPhysicalSection (xxx)

   <<<Editor Note: Need new IANA registration value for xxx. >>>

     ifSpeed           Actual bandwidth of the interface in bits per
                       second.  If the bandwidth of the interface is
                       greater than the maximum value of 4,294,967,295,
                       then the maximum value is reported and
                       ifHighSpeed must be used to report the
                       interface's speed.

     ifPhysAddress     An octet string with zero length.  (There is
                       no specific address associated with the
                       interface.)

     ifAdminStatus     The desired administrative state of the
                       interface.  Supports read-only access.

     ifOperStatus      The operational state of the interface.  The
                       value lowerLayerDown(7) is not used, since
                       there is no lower layer interface.  This object
                       is set to notPresent(6) if a component is
                       missing, otherwise it is set to down(2) if
                       either of the objects optIfOPSnCurrentStatus
                       indicates that any defect is present.

     ifLastChange      The value of sysUpTime at the last change in

                       to identify the physical or data entity
                       associated with this interface or an
                       OCTET STRING of zero length.  The
                       enterprise-specific convention is intended to
                       provide the means to reference one or more
                       enterprise-specific tables.

     ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable  Default value is enabled(1).  Supports
                             read-only access.

     ifHighSpeed       Actual bandwidth of the interface in Mega-bits
                       per second.  A value of n represents a range of
                       'n-0.5' to 'n+0.499999'.

     ifConnectorPresent Set to true(1).

     ifAlias           The (non-volatile) alias name for this interface
                       as assigned by the network manager.



4.2.2.  Use of ifTable for OCh Layer

   Use of ifTable for OCh Layer See RFC 3591 [RFC3591] section 2.4

4.2.3.  Use of ifStackTable

   Use of the ifStackTable and ifInvStackTable to associate the
   opticalPhysicalSection and opticalChannel interface entries is best
   illustrated by the example shown in Figure 3.  The example assumes an
   ops interface with ifIndex i that carries two multiplexed OCh
   interfaces with ifIndex values of j and k, respectively.  The example
   shows that j and k are stacked above (i.e., multiplexed into) i.
   Furthermore, it shows that there is no layer lower than i and no
   layer higher than j and/or k.

   interfaces reversed.

7.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

7.1.  Relationship to the [TEMPLATE TODO] MIB

7.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

8.  Definitions

   [TEMPLATE TODO]: put your valid MIB module here.
   A list of tools that can help automate the process of
   checking MIB definitions can be found at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-review-tools.html


9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),



G.Galimberti, et al.    Expires January 16, 2014               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft  draft-galikunze-ccamp-g-698-2-snmp-mib-03      July 2013


   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Option #1:

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }


   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
   draft MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in an internet draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
