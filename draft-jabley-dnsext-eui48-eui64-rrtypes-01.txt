      Resource Records for EUI-48 and EUI-64 Addresses in the DNS
               draft-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes-01

Abstract

   48-bit Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-48) and 64-bit Extended
   Unique Identifiers (EUI-64) are address formats specified by the IEEE
   for use in various layer-2 networks, e.g. ethernet.

   This document defines two new DNS resource record types, EUI48 and
   EUI64, for encoding ethernet addresses in the DNS.

Internet-Draft     Resource Records for EUI-48, EUI-64        March 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].
   This base specification defines many Resource Record (RR) Types, and
   subsequent specifications have defined others.  Each defined RRType
   provides a means of encoding particular data in the DNS.

   48-bit Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-48) [EUI48] and 64-bit
   Extended Unique Identifiers (EUI-64) [EUI64] are address formats
   specified by the IEEE for use in various layer-2 networks, e.g.
   ethernet.

   This document defines two new RR Types, EUI48 and EUI64 for encoding
   EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses in the DNS.

3.2.  EUI48 RR Presentation Format

   The Address field MUST be represented as six two-digit hexadecimal
   numbers separated by hyphens.  The hexadecimal digits "A" through "F"
   MAY be represented in either upper or lower case.

4.  The EUI64 Resource Record

   The EUI64 RR is used to store a single EUI-64 address in the DNS.

   The Type value for the EUI64 RR is 109 (decimal).

   The EUI64 RR is class-independent.

   The EUI64 RR has no special TTL requirements.

4.1.  EUI64 RDATA Wire Format

   The RDATA for an EUI48 RR consists of a single, 8-octet Address
   field, encoded in network (big-endian) order.

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.2.  EUI64 RR Presentation Format

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the RRType value 108 (decimal) for EUI48 and 109
   (decimal) for EUI64.  This document directs the IANA to confirm that
   the corresponding entries in the "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs"
   subregistry match the following data:

           +-------+-------+-------------------+---------------+
           | Type  | Value | Meaning           | Reference     |
           +-------+-------+-------------------+---------------+
           | EUI48 | 108   | an EUI-48 address | this document |
           |       |       |                   |               |
           | EUI64 | 109   | an EUI-64 address | this document |
           +-------+-------+-------------------+---------------+

A.1.  RRType Parameter Allocation Template

                   DNS RRTYPE PARAMETER ALLOCATION TEMPLATE

     A. Submission Date: 2013-03-18

     B.1 Submission Type:  [X] New RRTYPE  [ ] Modification to RRTYPE

     D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.

        The purpose of this RRTYPE application is to allow EUI-48
        and EUI-64 addresses to be stored in the DNS. EUI-48
        addresses are those used, for example, in ethernet.

     E. Description of the proposed RR type.

        See draft-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes for a full
        description.

     F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that
        need and why are they unsatisfactory?

        The TXT record can be used to store arbitrary, unstructured
        data in the DNS and hence could be used to store EUI-48 and
        EUI-64 addresses. This approach is unsatisfactory for the
        usual reasons, i.e. there is no opportunity for validating
        data before it is stored, and typographical errors must
        consequently be detected after data retrieval.

     G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

        EUI48 for EUI-48 addresses; EUI64 for EUI-64 addresses.

     H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA
        registry or require the creation of a new IANA sub-registry
        in DNS Parameters?  If so, please indicate which registry is
        to be used or created. If a new sub-registry is needed, specify

        the allocation policy for it and its initial contents. Also
        include what the modification procedures will be.

        No.

     I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
        servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
        as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

        No.

     J. Comments:

        See draft-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes for a complete
        specification.

A.2.  Change History

   00 Initial idea, circulated for the purposes of entertainment.

   01 Presentation format changed from colon-separated to hyphen-
      separated, to better match conventional usage for big-endian
      representations of EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses.  IEEE trademarks
      acknowledged.  Code-points assigned by expert review.  Other minor
      tweaks and fixes based on early review.
