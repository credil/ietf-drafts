      IPFIX Information Elements for Flow Performance Measurement
                draft-akhter-opsawg-perfmon-ipfix-02.txt

Abstract

   There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance of
   network applications and the network service in handling user data.
   This performance data provides information essential in validating
   service level agreements, fault isolation as well as early warnings
   of greater problems.  This document describes IPFIX Information
   Elements related to performance measurement of network based
   applications.  In addition, to the performance information several
   non-metric information elements are also included to provide greater
   context to the reports.  The measurements use audio/video
   applications as a base but are not restricted to these class of
   applications.

1.  Introduction

   Today's networks support a multitude of highly demanding and
   sensitive network applications.  Network issues are readily apparent
   by the users of these applications due to the sensitivity of these
   applications to impaired network conditions.  Examples of these
   network applications include applications making use of IP based
   audio, video, database transactions, virtual desktop interface (VDI),
   online gaming, cloud services and many more.  In some cases, the
   impaired application translates directly to loss of revenue.  In
   other cases, there may be regulatory or contractual service level
   agreements that motivate the network operator.  Due to the
   sensitivity of these types of applications to impaired service it
   leaves a poor impression of the service on the user-- regardless of
   the actual performance of the network itself.  In the case of an
   actual problem within the network service, monitoring the performance
   may yield a early indicator of a much more serious problem.

   Due to the demanding and sensitive nature of these applications,
   network operators have tried to engineer their networks towards
   wringing better and differentiated performance.  However, that same
   differentiated design prevents network operators from extrapolating
   observational data from one application to another, or from one set
   of synthetic (active test) test traffic to actual application
   performance.  This gap highlights the importance of generic
   measurements as well as the reliance on user traffic measurents--
   rather than synthetic tests.

   Performance measurements on user data provide greater visibility not
   only into the quality of experience of the end users but also
   visibility into network health.  With regards to network health, as
   flow performance is being measured, there will be visibility into the
   end to end performance which means that not only visibility into
   local network health, but also viability into remote network health.
   If these measurements are made at multiple points within the network
   (or between the network and end device) then there is not only
   identification that there might be an issue, but a span of area can
   be established where the issue might be.  The resolution of the fault
   increases with the number of measurement points along the flow path.

   The IP Flow Information Export Protocol (IPFIX) [RFC5101] provides
   new levels of flexibility in reporting from measurement points across
   the life cycle of a network based application.  IPFIX can provide
   granular results in terms of flow specificity as well as time
   granularity.  At the same time, IPFIX allows for summarization of
   data along different types of boundaries for operators that are
   unconcerned about specific sessions but about health of a service or
   a portion of the network.  This documet details the expresison of

   IPFIX Information Elements whose calculation is defined in an
   accompanying document.

   As this document covers the reporting of these metrics via IPFIX,
   consideration is taken with mapping the metric's capabilities and
   context with the IPFIX information and data representation model.
   The guidelines outlined in [I-D.trammell-ipfix-ie-doctors] are used
   to ensure proper IPFIX information element definition.

   There has been related work in this area such as [RFC2321].
   [I-D.huici-ipfix-sipfix], and [VoIP-monitor].  This document is also
   an attempt to generalize as well as standardize the reporting formats
   and measurement methodology.

3.  General Usage

3.1.  Quality of Service (QoS) Monitoring

   The network operator needs to be able to gauge the end user's
   satisfaction with the network service.  While there are many
   components of the satisfaction such as pricing, packaging, offering,
   etc., a major component of satisfaction is delivering a consistent
   service.  The user builds trust on this consistency of the network
   service and is then to be able to run network applications-- which is
   of course the end goal.  Without the ability to deliver a consistent
   service for end user network applications network operator will be
   left dealing with price sensitive disgruntled users with very low
   expectations (if they don't have choice of operator) or abandonment
   (if they have choice).

   For QoS monitoring, it is importnat to be able to capture the
   applicaiton context.  For example, in the case of interactive audio
   flows, the codec and the fact that the application is interactive
   shoudl be captured.  The codec type can be used to determine loss
   thresholds affecting end user quality and the interactive nature
   would suggest threshodlds over one way delay.  The IPFIX reporting
   would need to keep this information organized together for opeartor
   to be able to perform correlated analysis.

3.2.  Service Level Agreemnt (SLA) Validation

   Similar to QoS and QoE validation, there might be contractual or
   regulatory requirements that need to be met by the network operator.
   Monitoring the performance of the flows allows the application
   operator, network operator as well as the end user to validate of the
   target service is being delivered.  While there is quite a diversity
   in the codification of network SLAs they may eventually involve some
   measurement of network uptime, end to end latency, end to end jitter
   and perhaps service response time.  In the case violation of the SLA,



Akhter                 Expires September 28, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                IPFIX PerfMon                   March 2012


   the start and end times, nature and network scope of the violation
   needs to be captured to allow for the most accurate settling of the
   SLA.

3.3.  Fault Isolation and Troubleshooting

   It has been generally easier to troubleshoot and fix problems that
   are binary in nature: it either works or does not work.  The host is
   pingable or not pingable.  However, the much more difficult to
   resolve issues that are transitory in nature, move from location to
   location, more complicated that simple ICMP reachability and many
   times unverifiable reports by the users themselves.  It is these
   intermittent and seemingly inconsistent network impairments that
   performance metrics can be extremely helpful with.  Just the basic
   timely detection that there is a problem (or an impending problem)
   can give the provider the confidence that there is a real problem
   that needs to be resolved.  The next step would be to assist the
   operator in a speedy resolution by providing information regarding
   the network location and nature of the problem.


4.  New Information Elements

   The information elements are organized into two main groups:

   Transport Layer:  Metrics that might be calculated from observations
      at higher layers but essentially provide information about the
      network transport of user date.  For example, the metrics related
      to packet loss, latency and jitter would be defined here.

   User and Application Layer:  Metrics that are might be affected by
      the network indirectly, but are ultimately related to user, end-
      system and session states.  For example, session setup time,
      transaction rate and session duration would be defined here.

   Contextual Elements  Information elements that provide further
      context to the metrics.  For example, media type, codec type, and
      type of application would be defined here.
