         ICC_Operator_ID Attachment Individual Identifier (AII)
                   draft-chen-pwe3-mpls-tp-aii-icc-01

Abstract

   This document defines a new Attachment Individual Identifier (AII)
   type which could be used when ICC_Operator_ID is used to uniquely
   identify an operator.  The new AII (ICC_Operator_ID AII) consists a
   ICC_Operator_ID, a prefix and a AC ID field.

1.  Introduction

   RFC6370 [RFC6370] specifies an initial set of identifiers to be used
   in the Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).
   The Global_ID is defined in RFC6370 [RFC6370] to uniquely identify an
   operator.  [I.D.draft-ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers]
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers] specifies the ICC_Operator_ID,
   an alternative way to uniquely identify an operator based on ITU-T
   conventions.

   RFC4447 [RFC4447] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing
   point- to-point pseudowires (PWs) between two provider edge (PE)
   nodes.  It defines the format of the GID FEC TLV and the use and
   semantics of the attachment group identifier (AGI).  Two types of
   Attachment Individual Identifier (AII) have been defined.  AII Type 1
   defined in RFC6074[RFC6074] has a fixed-length 32-bit value that is
   unique within the scope of the local Provider Edge (PE).  AII Type 2
   defined in RFC5003 [RFC5003] consists a 4-octet length Global ID, a
   32-bit prefix field and a 4-octet attachment circuit identifier (AC
   ID) field.  Existing AIIs do not support ICC_Operator_ID based
   identifier.

   This document defines a new AII type (ICC_Operator_ID AII).  It use a
   combination of a 8-octet length ICC_Operator_ID, a 4-octet length
   prefix and a 4-octet length AC ID to create globally unique AII
   values.


2.  ICC_Operator_ID AII

   ICC_Operator_ID AII has the consistent structure with AII Type 2,
   which permits varying levels of AII summarization to take place, thus
   reducing the scaling burden on the AII distribution mechanisms and PE
   memory as described in RFC5003[RFC5003].  The encoding of
   ICC_Operator_ID AII is as follows:

   AII Type: To be allocated by IANA (0x03 is recommended).

   Length: 1 octet in length, specifies the length of the value field in
   octets.  The length is set to 14.

   ICC_Operator_ID: ICC_Operator_ID of the sender node.  As defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers], the ICC_Operator_ID is formed
   by Country Code (CC) and ICC(ITU-T Carrier Code ) as CC::ICC.  The
   ICC itself is a string of one to six characters, global uniqueness is
   assured by concatenating the ICC with a CC.  The Country Code
   (alpha-2) is a string of two alphabetic characters represented with
   upper case letters (i.e., A-Z).  When the length of a ICC_Operator_ID
   string is less than 8 octets, the higher-order unused octets of the
   ICC_Operator_ID field MUST be set to zero.

   Prefix: Same as [RFC5003].

   AC ID field: Same as [RFC5003].

2.1.  Procedures

   Since the operator could be identified by either the Global_ID or
   ICC_Operator_ID, the two ends of a PW may use the different AII type.
   During the Label Mapping procedure, one end may not map the TAI to
   one of its Forwarders.  In this case, it MUST send a Label Release
   message to the other end, with a Status Code of "Unassigned/
   Unrecognized TAI", and the processing of the Label Mapping message is
   complete.

   IANA maintains a registry of "Attachment Individual Identifier (AII)

   follows:

   AII Type

   ICC_Operator_ID 0x03(TBD)


4.  Security Considerations

   This draft does not introduce any new security issues, the security
   mechanisms defined in [RFC5003] apply here.
