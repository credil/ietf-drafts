1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   process implementing the Essential-Connected Dominating Set (E-CDS)
   [RFC5614] algorithm for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs).  The E-CDS
   process transforms a 2-hop neighborhood topology information set for
   routers to dynamically perform relay self-election to form a
   Connected Dominating Set (CDS).  The ECDS-MIB, an extension to the
   SMF-MIB [draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-06], reports state information,
   performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to
   configuration, this additional state and performance information is
   useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects
   are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
   in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in STD 58, [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58,
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The E-CDS algorithm provides method for implementing selection of
   Multipoint Relay nodes that define an estimate of the Minimum
   Connected Dominating Set (MCDS) flooding.  The MCDS provides an
   efficient and complete coverage of the nodes comprising the MANET.
   The packet forwarding rules do not require knowledge of the previous
   hop.  Routers that run Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF)
   [RFC6621] and have E-CDS enabled can be mixed with routers that run
   SMF and Classic Flooding (CF) enabled without a problem, even when
   the CF nodes are not participating in the Neighborhood Discovery
   Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130].  Another benefit is that packets
   opportunistically received from non-symmetric neighbors may be
   forwarded without compromising flooding efficiency or correctness.

Internet-Draft                  ECDS-MIB                    January 2013


   Furthermore, multicast sources not participating in NHDP may freely
   inject their traffic and any neighboring E-CDS relays will properly
   forward the traffic.  The E-CDS based relay set selection algorithm
   is defined in [RFC5614].

4.1.  ECDS-MIB Management Model

   As mentioned in Overview Section, the ECDS-MIB is an extension to
   SMF-MIB.  The SMF-MIB defines the management interfaces into the SMF
   process.  The SMF process is a framework for efficient broadcast
   capabilities within a MANET.  As part of the management interfaces,
   the SMF-MIB contains configuration objects required for the common
   management of all CDS processes.  The SMF-MIB contains a capabilities
   table which lists the set of CDS algorithms supported by the specific
   router.  However, the SMF-MIB does not define objects for
   configuration which are specific to the particular CDS process in
   question.  Hence, it is required that additional MIB modules be
   defined for each new CDS process implemented on the router.  In this
   sense, these additional MIB-modules extend the SMF-MIB.

   The various CDS algorithms are referred to as Relay Set Selection
   Algorithm (RSSA) within the SMF specification.  The RSSAs can rely
   upon topology information gotten from the MANET NHDP, from the
   specific MANET routing protocol running on the node, or from Layer 2
   information passed up to the higher layer protocol processes.  In the
   ECDS process, nodes can select themselves as relays using a router

   identifier and a nodal metric known as "Router Priority" for all one-
   hop and two-hop neighbors.  Changing the Router Priority can result
   in different realizations of CDSs for a given network topology.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Control Objects - Objects which are initialized to default
      settings or set through the management interface defined by this
      MIB.

   o  State Objects - objects are automatically generated values which
      define the current operating state of the E-CDS process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - objects are automatically generated values
      which help an administrator or automated tool to assess the
      performance of the CDS multicast process on the router and the
      overall multicasting performance within the MANET routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the ECDS-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  ecdsMIBNotifications - defines notifications that are associated
      with ECDS-MIB

   o  ecdsMIBObjects - defines objects as part of the structure of ECDS-
      MIB.  These objects are divided as follows:

      *  Configuration Group - this group contains ECDS objects that
         configure specific options that determine the overall operation
         of ECDS process.

      *  State Group - this group contains ECDS objects that describe
         the state of the ECDS process.

      *  Performance Group - this groups contains ECDS objects that help
         operators to characterize the performance of the ECDS process
         as configured.

   o  ecdsMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of the
      implementations of this ECDS-MIB module.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions defined within the ECDS-MIB are as follows:

   o  EcdsStatus - is defined within the ECDS-MIB.  This contains the
      current operational status of the E-CDS process on an interface.

5.2.  The Configuration Group

   The E-CDS device is configured with a set of controls.  Some of the
   prominent configuration controls for the SMF E-CDS device follow:

   o  E-CDS Operational Mode (ecdsAdminStatus) - indicates that the
      router has E-CDS enabled.

   o  Router Identifier (ecdsRouterIDAddrType and ecdsRouterID) -
      indicates router's unique identifier in E-CDS neighborhood.

   o  Router Priority (ecdsConfiguredRouterPriority) - indicates nodal
      metric value for all one-hop and two-hop neighbors.

   o  Configuration method that computes Router Priority
      (ecdsConfiguredRtrPriMethod) - indicates what method the Router
      Priority is computed, i.e., dynamically configured, management
      configured, or other.

5.3.  The State Group

   The state of an ECDS device can be retrieved from the following
   objects:

   o  E-CDS Configuration State (ecdsOperationStatus) - a state that
      indicates whether or not the ECDS process is enabled or disabled
      on the node.

   o  E-CDS Operational State (ecdsCurrentInEcds) - a state that
      indicates whether or not the node currently in or out of the Relay
      Set

   o  E-CDS Current Router Priority Value (ecdsCurrentRtRPriValue) - the
      Router Priority that is currently assigned to the device.

5.4.  The Performance Group

   The E-CDS performance counters consist of per node objects:

Internet-Draft                  ECDS-MIB                    January 2013


   o  Counter of times the given node changed into or out of E-CDS
      (ecdsInEcdsChange).

   o  Counter of times the Router Priority has been changed
      (ecdsCurrentRtrPriValueChange).

5.5.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Sub-tree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the ECDS-MIB and their intended purpose or utility.
   These include:

   o  ecdsAdminStatusChange - this notification is sent when
      ecdsAdminStatus is changed.

   o  ecdsConfiguredMemberChange - this notification is sent when
      cdsConfiguredMember is changed.

   o  ecdsIfRtrPriChange - this notification is sent when ecdsIfRtrPri
      value is changed.

   o  ecdsRtrPriMethodChange - this notification is sent when
      ecdsConfiguredRtrPriMethod is changed.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The ECDS-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the SMF-MIB

   This ECDS-MIB module is an extension of the SMF-MIB module in the
   sense previously discussed.  To manage SMF router with ECDS-enabled,
   both SMF-MIB and ECDS-MIB implementations are required.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The textual conventions imported for use in the SMF-MIB are as
   follows:

   o  The MODULE-IDENTITY, OBJECT-TYPE, NOTIFICATION-TYPE, Counter32,
      Unsigned32, Integer32 and mib-2 textual conventions are imported
      from [RFC2578].

Internet-Draft                  ECDS-MIB                    January 2013


   o  The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, RowStatus and TruthValue textual
      conventions are imported from [RFC2579].

   o  The MODULE-COMPLIANCE, OBJECT-GROUP and NOTIFICATION-GROUP textual
      conventions are imported from [RFC2580].

   o  The InetAddress, InetAddressType and InetAddressPrefixLength
      textual conventions are imported from [RFC4001].

8.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security implications of the choices made in
   this ECDS-MIB module.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects maybe considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support of SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are objects and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   o  ecdsAdminStatus - this writable configuration object controls the
      operational status of the SMF ECDS process.  If this setting is
      configured inconsistently across the MANET multicast domain, then



Nguyen & Cole             Expires July 6, 2013                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                  ECDS-MIB                    January 2013


      the delivery of multicast data maybe also be inconsistent across
      the domain.

   o  ecdsRouterIDAddrType and ecdsRouterID - these writable
      configuration objects define the identifier (ID) of the SMF E-CDS
      process.  These objects should be configured with a routable
      address defined on the local SMF E-CDS device.  The ecdsRouterID
      is the logical identification that must be consistent across
      interoperating SMF E-CDS neighborhoods.  The ecdsRouterID is
      recommended to be chosen as the numerically largest address
      contained in a node's 'Neighbor Address List' as defined in NHDP
      [RFC6130].

   o  ecdsConfiguredRtrPriMethod - this writable configuration object
      indicates how the value of Router Priority is computed.

   o  ecdsConfiguredRouterPriority - this writable configuration object
      indicates a nodal metric for all 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors.  Relay
      routers use tuple of router identifier and router priority to
      compute self-election of MPR.

   o  ecdsConfiguredMember - this writable configuration object defines
      a set of forwarders for multicast forwarding.  Sometimes, it is
      useful to force an agent to be included or excluded from the
      resulting CDS.  This object is a switch to allow for this
      behavior.  Mis-configuration of the object may cause the MANET
      flooding to break due to logical splits in the topology.

9.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes objects for configuring Essential Connected
   Dominating Set (E-CDS) process parameters on a router.  This MIB
   module, denoted ECDS-MIB module, also reports state, performance
   information and notifications.  Since it is an extension of SMF-MIB
   module, the same applicability examples can be found in SMF-MIB
   draft.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:


           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------
           ECDS-MIB          { experimental 9999 }
           IANA EDITOR NOTE: please assign 9999

11.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses templates authored by D. Harrington which is
   based on contributions from the MIB Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M. Heard, and Randy Presuhn.

12.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to acknowledge the valuable comments from
   Ulrich Herberg in the early phases of the development of this MIB-
   module.  Further, the authors would like to acknowledge to work of
   Brian Little and Ryan Morgan on their software development of the
   ECDS-MIB.

13.  Change Log

   This section tracks the revision history in the development of this
   ECDS-MIB.  It will be removed from the final version of this
   document.

   These changes were made from draft-nguyen-manet-ecds-mib-01 to
   draft-nguyen-manet-ecds-mib-02:

   1.  Added references, applicability statement, security
       considerations, IANA considerations, acknowledgment.

   2.  Added ecdsRouterIDAddrType object to go along with ecdsRouterID

   These changes were made from draft-nguyen-manet-ecds-mib-00 to
   draft-nguyen-manet-ecds-mib-01:

   1.  Initial draft

14.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the ECDS-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.  Does this MIB module need to include the MDR Level as a state
       object?

   2.  Within the Security Section, we need to include a discussion of
       the problems caused by mis-configuring the ecdsRouterID, the
