    Requirement and protocol for WSON and non-WSON interoperability
          draft-shimazaki-ccamp-wson-interoperability-00.txt

Abstract

   GMPLS protocol enabled network operator to setup optical path network
   rapidly and dynamically.  Recently, WSON [8] is standardized to
   achieve WDM core network.  However, it is difficult that all network
   equipment supports WSON protocol.  Therefore, interoperability
   between WSON and non-WSON nodes is needed to construct path network.

   This document describes requirement for interoperability between WSON
   node and non-WSON nodes and functions that routing and signaling
   protocol should support.

Internet-Draft     WSON and non-WSON interoperability          June 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes interoperability mechanism between non-WSON
   nodes and WSON nodes.

   GMPLS [1] defines routing and signaling protocol extension to control
   multilayer network. [2] describes GMPLS extended OSPF. [2] added four
   sub-TLVs to Link TLV that is defined in OSPF-TE [3]. [4] describes
   GMPLS extended RSVP-TE. [4] added new object to RSVP-TE [5].

   [6] defines PCE basic architecture.  It defines path computation
   entity separated from network element for traffic engineering.

   WSON network consists of WDM link, tunable transmitter receiver,
   ROADM, wavelength converter, and electro-optical network elements.
   [8] defines control framework of these components with GMPLS and PCE
   protocol.  WSON protocol extension is extension to GMPLS protocols
   [2], [5].  For example, WSON extended OSPF draft mentions that
   wavelength Availability information is added to Link TLV of GMPLS
   extended OSPF-TE, as well as GMPLS extended OSPF added four sub-TLVs
   to Link TLV of OSPF-TE [3].

   The Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON), referring to
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) based optical network in which
   switching is performed selectively based on the wavelength of an
   optical signal, is a promising optical network in that it provides
   broadband and energy-saving transmission.  Recently, WSON-supported
   ROADMs and OXCs appear and interoperating experiments have been
   demonstrated.  On the other hand, there are few commercially-
   available routers working in WSON.

   This document describes requirement for interoperability between WSON
   and non-WSON nodes and functions that routing and signaling protocol
   should support.  Under the proposed operation, non-WSON nodes (ex.
   routers sending/receiving electrical signal) do not send GMPLS
   protocol messages related to WSON, while necessary message objects
   are exchanged and relayed among WSON nodes (ex.  ROADMs and OXCs).


2.  Requirements

2.1.  Requirements for non-WSON nodes

   Non-WSON nodes need to have no impact on interoperating WSON nodes.
   Detail is described in below.

   When non-WSON node receives routing protocol information that
   includes WSON extended information, the node should ignore the WSON

   extended information and understand the conventional GMPLS
   information and add this information to traffic engineering database
   (TED).  It must transfer routing information to neighbor node.

   Non-WSON node should combine two TEDs, WSON and non-WSON and make one
   TED.  Non-WSON node can calculate the path route under the whole
   network topology including WSON network.  In WSON network, both route
   and wavelength should be determined.  However, non-WSON node does not
   have wavelength information in the TED, so it calculates only route
   without considering available wavelength information.

   Non-WSON node can send signaling message to next hop node and setup
   path strictly or loosely.

   When non-WSON node receive path request message of signaling protocol
   with WSON information in explicit route object, such as lambda label,
   the node should cancel the signaling and send path error message to
   source node.  In the other hand, it receives path request message
   with WSON information in record route object, the node can ignore the
   incomprehensible information and continue path setup procedure.

2.2.  Requirements for WSON nodes

   WSON nodes need to handle not only WSON-extended information but also
   no WSON information.  WSON nodes at the border of WSON need to
   compute available wavelength along the assigned path by non-WSON
   nodes, or compute both a route and available wavelength at the same
   time if non-WSON nodes doesn't assign a route in WSON strictly or
   there are no available wavelength along the assigned route by non-
   WSON nodes.

   WSON nodes at the border of WSON need to add WSON-extended objects to
   a signalling protocol messages after receiving them from non-WSON
   nodes.  WSON nodes at the border of WSON need to take WSON-extended
   objects from a signalling protocol before relaying them to non-WSON
   nodes.  Note that this function is optional if non-WSON nodes neglect
   WSON-extended information in a signalling protocol received.


3.  Protocols

3.1.  OSPF-TE

   Non-WSON nodes ignore available lambda information.  When LSA include
   both lambda and other information, for example adjacency or SC
   information in Link-TLV, it is desirable that non-WSON nodes ignore
   only lambda information.  ROADMs/OXCs advertise and share available
   lambda information.

Internet-Draft     WSON and non-WSON interoperability          June 2011


3.2.  RSVP-TE

   Non-WSON nodes send RSVP-TE PATH message including just route
   information.  WSON nodes add lambda information to be used in WSON to
   RSVP-TE PATH message.  Additionally, it is desirable that OXC at the
   egress border delete lambda information from PATH message.

3.3.  PCE

   There are several computation models in terms of "who computes what".
   non-WSON nodes calculate just path route.  In WSON area, WSON nodes
   or PCE calculate wavelength selection or RWA problem.

        |     Path route    |           non-WSON nodes           |
        | Wavelength or RWA | Nodes at the border of WSON or PCE |
        +-------------------+------------------------------------+

4.  Path setup scenario

   Under the proposed path set-up control, a source non-WSON nodes
   compute a path route with constraint shortest path fast (CSPF).  A
   border node of WSON computes an available wavelength and, if
   necessary, a route.  Then, the border node adds wavelength
   information, which is used in WSON, to signaling message.  The other
   border node of WSON takes the wavelength information from the
   signaling message and sends it to a node outside WSON.

   One of recommended GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling scenarios is described as
   follows based on Fig.1, in which non-WSON nodes don't support WSON
   and are outside WSON, while ROADMs are in WSON.  Firstly, a source
   non-WSON node R1 sends RSVP-TE signaling by assigning only R2 loosely
   as a path route and switching type as Label Switching Capable (LSC).
   Here, R1 is assumed to understand a topology in LSC region including
   all of the non-WSON nodes and ROADMs with OSPF-TE.  When a ROADM O1
   receives the signaling message from R1, it sends path computation
   request to PCE with the route information which R1 calculates to
   select the wavelength in WSON.  When a PCE receives the path
   computation request, its routing and wavelength assignment (RWA)
   algorithm computes one of available wavelengths along the route O1-O2
   which R1 calculates.  If there is no available wavelength, the PCE's
   RWA algorithm computes both a route and one of available wavelengths.
   After calculation, PCE replies the route and wavelength to O1.  When

   O1 receives route wavelength reply message from PCE, then sends the
   signaling which assigns explicit route object (ERO) and wavelength
   label to the next node.

5.  Security considerations

   This document does not require changes to the security models within
   GMPLS and associated protocols.  That is, the OSPF-TE, RSVP-TE, and
   PCEP security models could be operated unchanged.


6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.  Once finalized in our approach we will need identifiers for
   such things and modulation types, modulation parameters, wavelength
   assignment methods, etc...
