            Additional Media Type Structured Syntax Suffixes
              draft-ietf-appsawg-media-type-suffix-regs-01

Abstract

   A content media type name sometimes includes partitioned meta-
   information distinguish by a Structured Syntax, to permit noting an
   attribute of the media as a suffix to the name.  This document
   defines several Structured Syntax Suffixes for use with media type
   registrations.  In particular, it defines and registers the "+json",
   "+ber", "+der", "+fastinfoset", "+wbxml" and "+zip" Structured Syntax
   Suffixes, and updates the "+xml" Message Type Structured Syntax
   Suffix registration.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC3023] created the +xml suffix convention that can be used when
   defining names for media types whose representation uses XML
   underneath.  That is, they could have been successfully parsed as if
   the media type had been application/xml in addition to their being
   parsed as their media type that is using the +xml suffix.  [I-D.ietf-
   appsawg-media-type-regs] defines the Message Type Structured Syntax
   Suffixes registry to be used for such Structured Syntax Suffixes.

   A variety of Structured Syntax Suffixes have already been used in
   some media type registrations, in particular "+json", "+der",
   "+fastinfoset" and "+wbxml".  This document defines and registers
   these Structured Syntax Suffixes in the Structured Syntax Suffix
   registry, along with "+ber" and "+zip".  In addition, this document
   updates the "+xml" Structured Syntax Suffix registration.

   Discussion of this document should occur in the Apps Area Working
   Group (apps-discuss@ietf.org).  [RFC Editor note: remove this
   paragraph.]

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  When to Use these Structured Syntax Suffixes

   Each of the Structured Syntax Suffixes defined in this document is
   appropriate for use when the media type identifies the semantics of
   the protocol payload.  That is, knowing the semantics of the specific
   media type provides for more specific processing of the content than
   that afforded by generic processing of the underlying representation.

   At the same time, using the suffix allows receivers of the media
   types to do generic processing of the underlying representation in
   cases where

      they do not need to perform special handling of the particular
      semantics of the exact media type, and,

      there is no special knowledge needed by such a generic processor
      in order to parse that underlying representation other than what
      would be needed to parse any example of that underlying
      representation.

3.  Initial Structured Syntax Suffix Definitions

3.1.  The +json Structured Syntax Suffix

   [RFC4627] defines the "application/json" media type.  The suffix
   "+json" MAY be used with any media type whose representation follows
   that established for "application/json".  The Message Type Structured
   Syntax Suffix registration form follows.  See [I-D.ietf-appsawg-
   media-type-regs] for definitions of each of the registration form
   headings.

   Name:               JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

   +suffix:            +json

   References:         [RFC4627]

   Encoding considerations: Per [RFC4627], JSON is allowed to be
                       represented using UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.  When
                       JSON is written in UTF-8, JSON is 8bit compatible
                       ([RFC2045]).  When JSON is written in UTF-16 or
                       UTF-32, JSON is binary ([RFC2045]).

   Fragment identifier considerations: Media types using "+json" SHOULD
                       process any fragment identifiers defined for
                       "application/json" in the same way as defined for
                       that media type.  (At publication of this
                       document, there is no fragment identification
                       syntax defined for "application/json".) Specific
                       media types using "+json" MAY identify additional
                       fragment identifier considerations, MAY define
                       processing for fragment identifiers that are
                       classed as errors for "application/json" and MAY
                       designate fragment identifiers defined for
                       "application/json" that SHOULD NOT be used.

3.2.  The +ber Structured Syntax Suffixes

   The ITU defined the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) message transfer
   syntax in [ITU.X690.2008].  The suffix "+ber" MAY be used with any
   media type whose representation follows the BER message transfer
   syntax.  The Message Type Structured Syntax Suffix registration form
   for +ber follows:

   Name:               Basic Encoding Rules (BER) message transfer
                       syntax

   +suffix:            +ber

   References:         [ITU.X690.2008]

   Encoding considerations: BER is a binary encoding.

   Fragment identifier considerations: n/a

   Interoperability considerations: n/a

   Security considerations: There are no security considerations
                       inherent in BER.  Each individual media type
                       registered with a +ber suffix can have additional
                       security considerations.

3.3.  The +der Structured Syntax Suffixes

   The ITU defined the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) message
   transfer syntax in [ITU.X690.2008].  The suffix "+der" MAY be used
   with any media type whose representation follows the DER message
   transfer syntax.  The Message Type Structured Syntax Suffix
   registration form for +der follows:

   Name:               Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) message
                       transfer syntax

   +suffix:            +der

   References:         [ITU.X690.2008]

   Encoding considerations: DER is a binary encoding.

   Fragment identifier considerations: n/a

   Interoperability considerations: n/a

   Security considerations: There are no security considerations
                       inherent in DER.  Each individual media type
                       registered with a +der suffix can have additional

                       control over this registration.

3.4.  The +fastinfoset Structured Syntax Suffix

   The ITU defined the Fast Infoset document format as a binary
   representation of the XML Information Set in [ITU.X891.2005].  These
   documents further define the "application/fastinfoset" media type.
   The suffix "+fastinfoset" MAY be used with any media type whose
   representation follows that established for "application/
   fastinfoset".  The Message Type Structured Syntax Suffix registration
   form follows:

   Name:               Fast Infoset document format

   +suffix:            +fastinfoset

   References:         [ITU.X891.2005]

   Encoding considerations: Fast Infoset is a binary encoding.  The
                       binary, quoted-printable and base64 content-
                       transfer-encodings are suitable for use with Fast
                       Infoset.

   Fragment identifier considerations: Media types using "+fastinfoset"
                       SHOULD process any fragment identifiers defined
                       for "application/fastinfoset" in the same way as
                       defined for that media type.  (At publication of
                       this document, there is no fragment
                       identification syntax defined for "application/
                       fastinfoset".) Specific media types using
                       "+fastinfoset" MAY identify additional fragment
                       identifier considerations, MAY define processing
                       for fragment identifiers that are classed as
                       errors for "application/fastinfoset" and MAY
                       designate fragment identifiers defined for
                       "application/fastinfoset" that SHOULD NOT be
                       used.

                       inherent in Fast Infoset.  Each individual media
                       type registered with a +fastinfoset suffix can
                       have additional security considerations.

                       control over this registration.

3.5.  The +wbxml Structured Syntax Suffix

   The WAP Forum has defined the WAP Binary XML (WBXML) document format
   as a binary representation of XML in [WBXML].  This document further
   defines the "application/vnd.wap.wbxml" media type.  The suffix
   "+wbxml" MAY be used with any media type whose representation follows
   that established for "application/vnd.wap.wbxml".  The Message Type
   Structured Syntax Suffix registration form follows:

   Name:               WAP Binary XML (WBXML) document format

   +suffix:            +wbxml

   References:         [WBXML]

   Encoding considerations: WBXML is a binary encoding.

   Fragment identifier considerations: Media types using "+wbxml" SHOULD
                       process any fragment identifiers defined for
                       "application/vnd.wap.wbxml" in the same way as
                       defined for that media type.  (At publication of
                       this document, there is no fragment
                       identification syntax defined for "application/
                       vnd.wap.wbxml".) Specific media types using
                       "+wbxml" MAY identify additional fragment
                       identifier considerations, MAY define processing
                       for fragment identifiers that are classed as
                       errors for "application/vnd.wap.wbxml" and MAY
                       designate fragment identifiers defined for
                       "application/vnd.wap.wbxml" that SHOULD NOT be
                       used.

   Interoperability considerations: n/a

   Security considerations: There are no security considerations
                       inherent in WBXML.  Each individual media type
                       registered with a +wbxml suffix can have

Internet-Draft       Additional Media Type Suffixes             May 2012

3.6.  The +zip Structured Syntax Suffix

   The ZIP format is a public domain, cross-platform, interoperable file
   storage and transfer format, originally defined by PKWARE, Inc.; it
   supports compression and encryption and is used as the underlying
   representation by a variety of file formats.  The media type
   "application/zip" has been registered for such files.  The suffix
   "+zip" MAY be used with any media type whose representation follows
   that established for "application/zip".  The Message Type Structured
   Syntax Suffix registration form follows:

   Name:               ZIP file storage and transfer format

   +suffix:            +zip

   References:         [ZIP]

   Encoding considerations: ZIP is a binary encoding.

   Fragment identifier considerations: Media types using "+zip" SHOULD
                       process any fragment identifiers defined for
                       "application/zip" in the same way as defined for
                       that media type.  (At publication of this
                       document, there is no fragment identification
                       syntax defined for "application/zip".) Specific
                       media types using "+zip" MAY identify additional
                       fragment identifier considerations, MAY define
                       processing for fragment identifiers that are
                       classed as errors for "application/zip" and MAY
                       designate fragment identifiers defined for
                       "application/zip" that SHOULD NOT be used.

   Interoperability considerations: n/a

   Security considerations: ZIP files support two forms of encryption:
                       Strong Encryption and AES 128-bit, 192-bit and
                       256-bit encryption; see the specification for
                       further details.  Each individual media type
                       registered with a +zip suffix can have additional
                       security considerations.

   Fragment identifier considerations: Media types using "+xml" SHOULD
                       process any fragment identifiers defined for
                       "application/xml" in the same way as defined for
                       that media type.  (At publication of this
                       document, the fragment identification syntax
                       considerations for "application/xml" are defined
                       in [RFC3023], sections 5 and 7.) Specific media
                       types using "+xml" MAY identify additional
                       fragment identifier considerations, MAY define
                       processing for fragment identifiers that are
                       classed as errors for "application/xml" and MAY
                       designate fragment identifiers defined for
                       "application/xml" that SHOULD NOT be used.
