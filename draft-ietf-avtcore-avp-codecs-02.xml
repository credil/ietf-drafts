<abstract>
<t>
The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP)
 is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure Real-time Transport
 Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
 Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile
 for RTCP-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF).
This document updates the RTP/AVP profile (and by extension, the profiles that
 build upon it) to reflect changes in audio codec usage since the document was
 originally published.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
<xref target="RFC3551"/> says that audio applications operating under the
 RTP/AVP profile SHOULD be able to send and receive PCMU and DVI4.
However, in practice, many RTP deployments do not support DVI4, and its utility
 is limited in the presence of much more modern codecs.
This document updates the recommended audio codec selection for the RTP/AVP
 profile to remove the SHOULD for DVI4.
By extension, this also updates the profiles which build on RTP/AVP, including
 <xref target="RFC3711">RTP/SAVP</xref>,
 <xref target="RFC4585">RTP/AVPF</xref>, and
 <xref target="RFC5124">RTP/SAVPF</xref>.

<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
 "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
 interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>

<section anchor="updates" title="Updates to RFC 3551">
<t>
The following text of <xref target="RFC3551"/> is hereby updated as set forth
 below in&nbsp;<xref target="update-section-6"/>.
</t>

<t>
Audio applications operating under this profile SHOULD, at a minimum,
 be able to send and/or receive payload types 0&nbsp;(PCMU) and 5&nbsp;(DVI4).
This allows interoperability without format negotiation and ensures
 successful negotiation with a conference control protocol.
</t>

<section anchor="update-section-6" title="Updates to Section 6">
<t>
In the final paragraph of Section 6, replace, "payload types 0&nbsp;(PCMU) and
 5&nbsp;(DVI4)," with "payload type 0&nbsp;(PCMU)."
Also, add a final sentence to this paragraph that states, "Some environments
 REQUIRE support for PCMU."
This results in the following paragraph:
</t>

<t>
Audio applications operating under this profile SHOULD, at a minimum,
be able to send and/or receive payload type 0&nbsp;(PCMU). This allows
interoperability without format negotiation and ensures successful
negotiation with a conference control protocol. Some environments
REQUIRE support for PCMU.
