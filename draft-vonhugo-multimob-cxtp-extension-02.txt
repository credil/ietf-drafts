Internet-Draft        CXTP Extension for Multicast           August 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension of the Context Transfer Protocol
   (CXTP) [9] to provide seamless handover for multicast communications
   operated with Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [2].  When a mobile node
   receiving multicast data detaches from the current MAG and attaches
   to a new MAG, the node should be able to continuously receive the
   multicast data through the new MAG just after the node completed
   handover without any MLD signaling on the new wireless link.  This
   procedure is multicast context transfer that provides multicast
   session continuity and avoids extra packet loss and session
   disruption.  Multicast context transfer will be the required function
   to support seamless handover, while for its effective procedure,
   interaction with multicast communication protocols should be taken
   into account.

   The Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) specification [9] describes the
   mechanism that allows better support for minimizing service
   disruption during handover.  In this document, CXTP is extended for
   the multicast context transfer protocol in PMIPv6.  "Multicast-
   Context Transfer Data (M-CTD)" is defined for transferring multicast
   membership state from a previously attached MAG (p-MAG) to a newly
   attached MAG (n-MAG) for PMIPv6.  The context transfer is either
   started from the n-MAG on its own after attachment of the mobile node
   or initiated by the p-MAG after being informed by the access network
   of the planned handover.  For data exchange between p-MAG and n-MAG a
   dedicated tunnel is assumed to be in place.  Whether this p-MAG -
   n-MAG tunnel has already been set up in advance or will be initiated
   during handover by either p-MAG or n-MAG will impact the overall
   session delay.  Details of this set-up procedure are out of scope of
   this document.

   An approach to apply CXTP to multicast for client-based mobile IPv6
   had been proposed in [13].

3.  Handover Process

   MAG is responsible for detecting the mobile node's movements to and
   from the access link and for initiating binding registrations to the
   mobile node's LMA.  MAG tracks the mobile node's movements to and
   from the access link and performs signaling of the status to the
   mobile node's LMA.  In PMIPv6, it SHOULD NOT be required for mobile
   nodes to initiate re-subscription to multicast channels, and MAG
   SHOULD keep multicast membership state for mobile nodes even if they
   attach a different MAG in PMIPv6-Domain.

   For multicast context transfer, an IGMP/MLD-based explicit membership
   tracking function [11] MUST be enabled on MAG (whether the MAG
   behaves as a router or proxy).  The explicit tracking function
   enables a router to keep track of downstream multicast membership
   state created by downstream hosts attached on the router's link.
   When a mobile node attaches to a new network, thanks to the explicit
   tracking function, the p-MAG extracts the mobile node's multicast
   membership state from complete multicast membership state the p-MAG
   has maintained and transmits it to the n-MAG.

3.1.  Multicast Context Transfer Data Format

   Multicast Context Transfer Data (M-CTD) is a message used with CXTP
   to transfer multicast membership state from p-MAG to n-MAG.  The
   following information is included in M-CTD to recognize mobile node's
   membership state.

   1.   Receiver address - indicates the address of the MN sending the
        Current-State Report.

   2.   Filter mode - indicates either INCLUDE or EXCLUDE as defined in
        [4].

   3.   Source addresses and multicast addresses - indicates the address
        pairs the MN has joined.

   The M-CTD message MUST contain the 'A' bit set as defined for the CTD
   message format in [9] for to initiate the transmission of a reply
   message by the new MAG.

   The following information included in a reply to M-CTD (similar to
   the CTDR message defined in [9]) is used to request the old MAG to
   store still incoming multicast data, to forward them to the new MAG,
   and finally to leave the multicast group after successful handover
   from n-MAG to p-MAG.

   1.   Receiver address - indicates the address of the MN sending the
        Current-State Report.

   2.   Flag indicating the p-MAG to start (B) buffering the received
        multicast data (in case the new connection is not yet fully set
        up), to forward (F) the buffered data after successful handover,
        or to leave (L) the multicast groups unless there are still
        other active subscriptions for the corresponding groups on the
        p-MAG.

   3.   Source addresses and multicast addresses - indicates the address
        pairs the MN has joined.

   The M-CTDR message MUST contain the 'S' bit set as defined for the
   CTD message format in [9] for to indicate the successful reception of
   context data at the new MAG.

   The explicit tracking function [11] does not maintain information of
   an (S,G) join request with EXCLUDE filter mode.  Therefore, when the
   "Filter mode" for a multicast session is EXCLUDE, "Source address"
   for the session MUST be set "Null".

3.2.  Multicast Context Transfer with MLD Proxy

   This section describes the case that MAG operates as an MLD proxy, as
   defined in [6] and specified in the base MultiMob solution [10].

   The MLD listener handover with CXTP and MLD proxy shown in Figure 1
   is defined as follows.

   1.   After attaching a new MAG, a mobile node sends a Router
        Solicitation (RS) as specified in [7].  As the MN shall remain
        unaware of any change in connectivity the n-MAG has to identify
        the p-MAG address during proxy binding registration process with
        the mobile node's LMA. n-MAG then sends a request for context
        transfer (CT-Req) to the p-MAG as defined in [9].  Since the MN
        cannot initiate the related Context Transfer Activate Request
        (CTAR) message that may be sent by the LMA.  In case the mobile
        node has the capability and the chance to signal to the p-MAG
        the link status and the potential new MAG address (e.g. as is
        specified in terms of Event Services by [8]) the p-MAG will send
        a CTAR message to n-MAG on behalf of the mobile node.
        Alternatively the p-MAG or the n-MAG may have information on
        potential MAGs in their vicinity to which such a CTAR or CT-Req
        message may be multicasted.

   2.   p-MAG provides together with the other feature data the
        multicast states corresponding to the moving MN-Identifier to
        n-MAG. p-MAG utilizes a context transfer protocol to deliver
        MN's Policy Profile to n-MAG, and sends Multicast Context
        Transfer Data (M-CTD) (defined in Section 3.1) to n-MAG.

   3.   If there are multicast channels the MN has subscribed but the
        n-MAG has not yet subscribed, n-MAG subscribes via sending
        (potentially aggregated) MLD [4][5] Membership Report messages
        (i.e.  Join) to the corresponding LMA.

   4.   n-MAG requests from p-MAG to store still incoming multicast data
        for transfer to MN after successful handover completion.  For
        this purpose a newly defined B-flag in the Multicast Context
        Transfer Response message is sent from n-MAG to p-MAG, denoted
        as M-CTDR(B).

   5.   After successful completion of MN attachment to n-MAG the
        forwarding of the stored Multicast data from p-MAG to n-MAG is
        initiated via sending a Multicast Context Transfer Response
        message with a newly defined F-flag from n-MAG to p-MAG, denoted
        as M-CTDR(F).

   6.   LMA forwards requested multicast data to the n-MAG which
        subsequently delivers them to MN.

   7.   n-MAG may request from p-MAG to leave those multicast groups it
        had subscribed to on behalf of the MN where MN had been the last
        member.  This is done via sending a Multicast Context Transfer
        Response message from n-MAG to p-MAG with a newly defined L-flag
        set, denoted as M-CTDR(L).

3.3.  Multicast Context Transfer with PIM-SM

   This section describes the case that MAG operates as a PIM-SM [3]
   router, as described in a proposed solution [12].

   The MLD listener handover with CXTP and PIM-SM shown in Figure 2 is
   defined as follows.

   1.   The first and second procedures are the same ones as described
        in Section 3.2.

   2.   If there are multicast channels the MN has subscribed but the
        n-MAG has not yet subscribed, n-MAG joins the multicast tree via
        sending PIM Join messages to the upstream router (Figure 2 shows
        the example that the upstream router is the corresponding LMA).

   3.   The remaining steps for completion of the context transfer are
        the same ones as described in Section 3.2 with the only
        exception being that p-MAG sends a PIM Prune message to LMA
        instead of a MLD Report (leave) message if there are no attached
        mobile nodes listening the multicast channels.
