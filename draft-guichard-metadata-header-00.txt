Internet-Draft               Metadata Format                   June 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a common header format that is used in IPv4,
   IPv6 and MPLS packets to carry metadata in addition to the payload.
   The format of specific metadata types and how the metadata is used is
   outside the scope of this document.  Anticipated uses of metadata
   include instrumentation of user data frames and service chaining.

   Mechanisms for identification of the presence of metadata within an
   IPv4, IPv6, or MPLS packet are addressed in separate documents
   [I-D.guichard-mpls-metadata].

1.1.  Terminology

   ACH   Associated Channel Header

   MCH   Metadata Channel Header

   MD    Metadata


2.  Metadata Component Structure

   The structure of the metadata component is common for IPv4, IPv6, and
   MPLS encapsulations.  It is comprised of a Header and a channel
   carrying Metadata, and is followed by the original packet payload.
   Figure 1 shows the complete structure:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                Metadata Channel Header (MCH)                  |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                 Metadata Channel (variable)                   |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                     Original Payload                          |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                  Figure 1: Metadata Component Structure

   The meanings of the metadata components are:

   o  Metadata Channel Header (MCH):  common header used for IPv4, IPv6,
      and MPLS packets to indicate the type and structure of the
      metadata carried within the packet.

   o  Metadata Channel:  the actual metadata.  The length and format of
      the metadata channel is outside the scope of this document and

      will vary depending upon the "Metadata Channel Type" specified in
      the MCH.  It is anticipated that there will be a number of
      instrumentation channels, as well as channels for functionality.

   o  Original Payload:  beneath the metadata will be the original
      packet payload.  This could be L3, L2 or MPLS payload.


3.  Metadata Channel Header Format

   The Metadata Channel Header (MCH) is similar in structure to the
   Associated Channel Header (ACH) as defined in [RFC5586].  The type
   and format of the actual metadata is defined in other documents.

   The proposed format of the MCH is as depicted in Figure 2:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |0 0 0 0|Version|    Protocol   |    Metadata Channel Type      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                 Figure 2: Metadata Channel Header Format

   The meanings of the fields in the MCH are:

   o  First Nibble:  it is set to 0000b to indicate a Metadata Channel
      associated with IPv4, IPv6, or MPLS.

   o  Version:  version number of the metadata channel.  This
      specification defines a value of 0.

   o  Protocol:  Where the network layer is MPLS this MUST be set to a
      value of 0 and ignored on reception.  Where the network layer is
      IPv4 [RFC0791] this carries the protocol number that identifies
      the protocol that follows the metadata, i.e. it contains the
      protocol number that would have been in the IP header if the
      metadata had not been inserted.  Similarly if the network layer is
      IPv6 [RFC2460] this is the final next-header value that would have
      been present if the metadata had not been inserted.

   o  Metadata Channel Type:  The Metadata Channel Type is defined in
      the IANA Metadata Channel Type registry Section 4.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document request IANA to create and maintain the "Metadata
   Channel Type" registry.  Registry entries are assigned by using the
   "IETF Review" policy defined in [RFC5226].

   IANA are requested to initally mark the registry as follows:
   Value               Description
   -----------------+-------------------------------
   0x0000              Reserved
   0x0001 - 0x7FF7     Unassigned
   0x7ff8 - 0x7FF7     Reserved for Experimental Use
   0x8000 - 0xFFFF     Unassigned


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations associated with the addition of metadata
   to packets are discussed in the network layer specific documents
   [I-D.guichard-mpls-metadata].  The security risks associated with
   each metadata type that is defined MUST be documented as part of the
   definition.
