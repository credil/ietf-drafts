Internet-Draft                 CAPABILITY                 September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document extends the base PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] with a new
   feature to discover the capabilities of a PCP-controlled device.
   Retrieving the capabilities of a PCP-controlled device would allow to
   avoid error, provide a hint why some applications fails, help select
   the OpCode to issue, etc.

   This option can be elected to be defined as a new OpCode.

   This option has been defined first in [I-D.boucadair-pcp-extensions].


2.  CAPABILITY

   The CAPABILITY option (Code: TBA, Figure 1) is used by a PCP Server
   to indicate to a requesting PCP Client the capabilities it supports
   with regards to port forwarding operations.

   Several Capability options MAY be conveyed in the same PCP response
   message if several functions are co-located in the same PCP-
   controlled device (e.g., NAT44 and NAT64, NAT44 and ports set
   assignment capability, etc.).

   This option, when received from a PCP Server, is used by a PCP Client
   to constraint the content of its requests and therefore avoid errors.

         This Option:

         Option Name: PCP Capabilities Option (CAPABILITY)
         Number: TBA (IANA)
         Purpose: Retrieve the capabilities of a PCP-controlled device
         Valid for Opcodes: ANNOUNCE, MAP, PEER
         Length: 0x01
         May appear in: both request and response
         Maximum occurrences: None


                        Figure 1: Capability option

   Below is provided a description of the F, T, P, A, S, C, I and O
   bits:

   Name Description
   ---- ----------------------------------------------------------------
     F  This bit indicates the address family of the source address
        issued by internal hosts
     T  This bit indicates the address family of the source address of
        the packets forwarded in the external side of the PCP-controlled
        device
     P  This bit indicates whether the source port number is translated
        or not.
     A  This bit indicates whether the source IP address is translated
        or not.
     S  This bit indicates whether the controlled device supports the
        ability to assign a set or ports
     C  This bit indicates whether the PCP-controlled devices inspects
        the received packets and if it can block them
     I  This bit indicates whether incoming packets are rejected unless
        an explicit rule is enforced in the PCP-controlled device
     O  This bit indicates whether outbound packets are inspected or not
        before being granted to leave the internal realm.

   The value of the F, T, P, A, S, C, I and O bits are as follows:
