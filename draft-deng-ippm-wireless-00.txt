1.  Introduction

   It is well-accepted that mobile Internet usage is going to increase
   fast in the coming years and replace the traditional voice service to
   be the dominant revenue source for mobile operators.  In the
   meantime, fast evolving network and terminal technologyies and
   changing service trend (e.g. social networking, video on demand,
   online reading, etc.) results in higher user service requirement.
   Therefore, as the basic infrastruture service provider, operators are
   deemed responsible for mobile Internet end-to-end performance, for
   subscribers want to get what they want, which gives rise to a basic
   yet important question: how does network service provider manage end-
   to-end service quality?  In particular, there are two goals for
   operator's quality management intiative:

   o  to make sure and validate the QoS metrics of specific IP flows
      agains the values pre-defined by the service SLA(Service Level
      Agreement) from the user/service provider's point of view; and
   o  to make sure and validate the sanity of network devices/links.

   In this draft, we analyze two usecases the potential problems of
   applying existing IP-based performance measurement methods to
   wireless accessing environments, which are tending to utilize resouce
   pooling and dynamic load balancing techques to accommodate
   explosively increasing data traffic, and conclude that more robust
   passive measuring methods and performance metrics are needed.

2.1.  Dynamic Load Balancing

   Pooling technology has been introduced to the user plane in the
   packet switched domain of operator's core network for cellular
   subscribers since 3GPP Release 5 (3GPP TS23.236).  With pooling, the
   traffic path from user equipements to the Internet via core network
   is not static, but rather dynamically assigned to a proper instantce
   of an device pool, according to load balancing policies.  The
   assignment is dynamically made at the time of user equipment's
   attachment establishement with the celluar core network, and would
   remain unchanged unless the mobile terminal detaches from the network
   or moves outside the base-stations' coverage subordinating to the
   specific core network's device pool.

   As shown by Figure 1, potential device pools along the path all the
   way from the user terminal via the packet switching domain of the
   mobile network core to a third party service provider over the
   Internet.  Examples of network devices that can be poolized
   includeSGSN(Serving GPRS Support Node) and GGSN(Gateway GPRS
   Supporting Node).  Moreover, the service provider could also
   implement load balancing on the server's side either via server-
   pooling within a data certer or via (third party) CDN nodes.

   Hence, under such environments, if active performance measurement
   methods[RFC4656][RFC5357] are employed, the injected bogus data
   traffic may traverse along a different path to the one used by the
   targeted traffic or even interfere with them due to the subtle nature
   of wireless-involved links (as explained in the next subsection).

2.2.  Radio Congestion Detection

   Mobile Internet usage is going to increase fast in the coming years
   due to the following facts: on one hand, as a result of pervasively
   deployed and fast maturing 3G/4G cellular technologies combined with
   smartphone's dominance in mobile handset's market, Internet data
   traffic via mobile operator's packet switched core network manifests
   to be an increasingly important contributor to the operator's
   revenue.  On the other hand, wireless technologies (such as WiFi
   through APs or celluar networks through small cells) are more and
   more accepted by the end users, either at home, in the office or in a
   pulic place, to be carring the "last mile" to various portable
   personal computing devices.

   There are two common features of the above two scenarios:

   o  the combination of both wireless and wired links along the end-to-
      end traffic path, and
   o  almost all the time, the wireless "last mile" would be the
      bottleneck of end-to-end service quality.

   To make more efficient use of relatively more scarce radio resouces,
   it is important for the core network to understand the congestion
   status of both wireless and wired links along the traffic path, and
   make proper management of data traffic through cell reselection or
   load balancing via pooling.

   However, the wireless link's thoughput is consistently subject to
   other interfereing factors (e.g. distance to the nearest base
   station, terminal's radio signal strength, random interferece,
   shadowing of buildings, multipath fading, etc.), which should be
   properly filtered out before handing over to the network management,
   as they are rooted in terminal mobility and outside the realm of
   mobile accessing network.

   In other words, there is considerable gap between IP measurement
   results to the performance evaluation and fault detection
   requirements in mobile-involved environment, if we directly employ
   active performance measurement
   methods[I-D.draft-chen-ippm-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework].

3.  Summary

   In summary, for mobile-ended data paths, we believe there is need for

   o  viable passive measurement methodology for Active measurements
      inject extra traffic, which may traverse along a different path to
      the one used by the targeted traffic or even interfere with them.
   o  robust metric against transient wireless conditions, as there is
      considerable gap between existing IP measurement metrics (e.g.
      delay, jitter, throughput etc.), which are subject to change
      caused by external environmental factors and of little use to
      operator's traffic management from the network side.
