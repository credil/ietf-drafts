Internet-Draft                 CAPABILITY                   October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document extends the base PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] with a new
   feature to discover the capabilities of a PCP-controlled device.
   Retrieving the capabilities of a PCP-controlled device would allow to
   avoid error, provide a hint why some applications fails, help select
   the OpCode to issue, etc.

   This option can be elected to be defined as a new OpCode.

   This option has been defined first in [I-D.boucadair-pcp-extensions].


2.  CAPABILITY

   The CAPABILITY option (Code: TBA, Figure 1) is used by a PCP Server
   to indicate to a requesting PCP Client the capabilities it supports
   with regards to port forwarding operations.

   One single Capability option is conveyed in the same PCP response
   message even if several functions are co-located in the same PCP-
   controlled device (e.g., NAT44 and NAT64, NAT44 and ports set
   assignment capability, etc.).

   This option, when received from a PCP Server, is used by a PCP Client
   to constraint the content of its requests and therefore avoid errors.

         This Option:

         Option Name: PCP Capabilities Option (CAPABILITY)
         Number: TBA (IANA)
         Purpose: Retrieve the capabilities of a PCP-controlled device
         Valid for Opcodes: ANNOUNCE, MAP, PEER
         Length: 16
         May appear in: both request and response
         Maximum occurrences: None


                        Figure 1: Capability option

   A-bit when set (i.e., 1) indicates the PCP Server supports
   authentication.  If this bit is set to 0, is indicates plain PCP is
   supported.

   The Capability Field is encoded in 127 bits.  Each bit in the
   Capability bit mask is used to represent the PCP-controlled device
   capability.  Several bits can be set if several functions are co-
   located in the same device.  The following values for the Capability
   field are:

      Bit #: Description
      1: NAT44
      2: Stateless NAT64 [RFC6145].
      4: Stateful NAT64 [RFC6146].
      8: A+P Port Range Router [RFC6346].
      16: IPv4 firewall Section 5
      32: IPv6 Firewall [RFC6092].
      64: NPTv6 [RFC6296].
      127: ILNP Translator [I-D.irtf-rrg-ilnp-arch]


3.  PCP Client/Server Behaviour

   This section specifies the behavior of the PCP Client and the PCP
   Server to handle the CAPABILITY Option.



Boucadair & Reddy        Expires April 14, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 CAPABILITY                   October 2012


   Once the PCP Client is configured with its PCP Server(s), it MAY
   issue an ANNOUNCE OpCode which enclose a CAPABILITY Option.  Sending
   the ANNOUNCE OpCode and the CAPABILITY Option allows the PCP Client
   to determine whether the PCP Server is alive and also to retrieve its
   capabilities.  Based on the received capabilities, the PCP Client may
   decide to tune its requests (e.g., Section 4) and decide whether all
   PCP Servers need to be contacted in parallel or only a subset of them
   should be contacted.

   Upon receipt of a PCP request from a PCP Client requiring the PCP
   Server to enforce an operation beyond its capabilities, the PCP
   Server MAY return an error code together with the CAPABILITY option.

   When a new PCP Server joins the network then it MAY send an ANNOUNCE
   OpCode with its capabilities (i.e., CAPABILITY Option).


4.  Option Usage

   Below are provided examples of the CAPABILITY Option usage:
   o  In an IPv6 network with NPTv6 [RFC6296], Firewalls implementing
      the PCP Server are on different devices: the PCP Client learns of
      the available PCP Servers by using DHCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] or any
      other PCP Server discovery technique defined in future
      specifications.  PCP Client learns the PCP Server capabilities
      using CAPABILITY Option.  The PCP Client sends MAP PCP request to
      PCP-controlled NPTv6 device with Internal Port=0 and Protocol=0
      (which means 'all ports for all protocols') to find the external
      IP address.  This PCP request has to be sent only once since NPTv6
      is stateless and provides a 1:1 relationship between addresses in
      the "inside" and "outside" prefixes.  The PCP Client will send PCP
      re-request to NTPv6 only before the Assigned Lifetime of the MAP
      response expires or when the host embedding the PCP Client
      acquires a new IPv6 address using "inside" prefix.  However PCP
      Client will send MAP/PEER requests to Firewall to create/delete
      dynamic outbound mapping or use PCP instead of its default
      application keep-alives to maintain the Firewall state alive.

   o  In a network with NAT64 [RFC6146], Firewall implementing PCP
      servers are on different devices: IPv6-only PCP Client can send
      PREFIX64 PCP Option [I-D.boucadair-pcp-nat64-prefix64-option] only
      to the PCP-controlled NAT64 device to learn the Prefix64(s) used
      to build IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.
   o  Multiple PCP-controlled devices: See Figure 3 the example of a
      network deploying several techniques to ensure interconnection
      with IPv4, provide IPv6-only connectivity, etc.  Of course, one
      can argue this configuration is no realistic.

   o  In a IPv6 network with ILNP translator [I-D.irtf-rrg-ilnp-arch],
      Firewall implementing PCP servers are on different devices.  PCP
      client needs to send PCP request only to the PCP-controlled ILNP
      translator to find Global Locators associated with Internal
      Locators.
   o  When the PCP-controlled device is a PRR, the PCP Client should use
      MAP_PORT_SET [I-D.tsou-pcp-natcoord] instead of MAP OpCode.


5.  Firewall

   There are various kinds of firewalls:
   o  Context or Zone-based firewalls, that protect systems within a
      perimeter from systems outside it.
   o  Pervasive routing-based measures, which protect intermingled
      systems from each other by enforcing role-based policies,
   o  Systems that analyze application behavior and trigger on events
      that are unusual, match a signature, or involve an untrusted peer.

   These firewalls types are explained in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-firewalls]
   and PCP server SHOULD be implemented on Context or Zone-based
