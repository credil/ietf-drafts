Internet-Draft             Data Model for CLUE                 June 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a data model for the CLUE Framework [I-D.ietf-
   clue-framework].

   The previous suggestion for a data model described the 2 CLUE
   messages, provider advertisement and consumer choice message.  The
   data model proposed here differs in that it describes the basic
   information, or definitions that are needed.  Messages can then
   derived from the data model, similarly to what was described in the
   earlier data model.

   The provider advertisement and the consumer choice messages can use
   or not use any of the data elements defined in the data model,
   subject only to whether or not the element is deemed mandatory.

   The model here follows the example of the xcon data model RFC 6501
   [RFC6501].

   Initially the data model may seem to describe only provider
   advertisements.  But this is not the case.  The consumer choice
   messages can also be constructed from these elements.  Many of the
   data elements are similar for both messages, but there are also
   elements defined which are used only in one or the other of the
   messages.

   One of the challenges here is that in addition to proposing a
   structure for the data model, we would like to also propose some
   additions or changes to what is in the current framework document.
   The problem is that any changes from what is in the current framework
   can detract attention from the basic information model which is the
   primary focus of this draft initially.  We have noted where there are
   changes from the framework by putting the text in all capital text.

   This is a rough draft, its goal is to propose a basic structure and
   stimulate discussion.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

Internet-Draft             Data Model for CLUE                 June 2012


3.  Overview

   TEXT

3.1.  Data model format

   A CLUE object document is an XML [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] document.
   CLUE object documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded
   using UTF-8.

3.2.  Data model namespace

   This specification defines a new namespace specification for
   identifying the elements defined in the data model.  This namespace
   is as follows: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:clue-info

3.3.  Data Model Structure

   The information in this data model is structured in the following
   manner.  All the information communicated between consumers and
   providers in a CLUE session is contained in a <CLUE-info> element.
   The definitions follow directly from the Framework document.

   The <CLUE-info> element contains the following child elements:

   o  The <capture-description> element describes the captures.  It
      includes all the elements that have been discussed in the
      framework document as properties of captures document and it can
      be extended by adding additional elements describing a capture.
   o  The <capture-scene> element is the data structure that describes
      the captures that the provider is capable of sending in a way that
      is helpfule to the consumer to decide what captures to request.
   o  The <simultaneous-transmission-set> element is a data structure
      that describes the physical simultaneity constraints, as discussed
      in the framework.
   o  The<stream-description> element describes the encoding
      characteristics of the streams.


4.  Data Model Definition

   The following non-normative diagram shows the structure of CLUE
   elements.  The symbol "!" preceding an element indicates that the
   element is REQUIRED in the data model.

                           Data Model Definition

   The following sections describe these elements in more detail.

4.1.  <CLUE-info>

4.2.  <capture-description>

   The capture-description describes all the aspects of a capture, as
   discussed in the framework document.

4.3.  <capture-id>

   This element is a unique numeric value assigned to each capture by
   the provider.  It is used by the consumer in choosing captures and
   streams.

4.4.  <media-type>

   This element indicates support by the consumer for a single capture
   media type, for instance "audio" or "video".

4.5.  <content-type>

   This per-capture attribute element indicates whether the media
   capture includes "main media", typically motion video of a real
   scene, or whether it includes "slides media", typically a computer-
   generated video stream rather than real people.

   This is following the content attribute RFC [ref].

4.6.  <DERIVED>

   Instead of the boolean composed, we are suggesting an attribute that
   indicates whether media capture has been changed from its original
   form.  It can take different values.  As of now, the only vlaue
   defined is composed.  Composed means a video image it is formed of
   other, more primary, captures mixed together.  For audio it refers to
   mixed audio.[this needs to follow whatever the WG decides as to
   whether there is an audio composed, etc.]

4.7.  <switched>

   Instead of a boolean, we propose this attribute indicates the
   algorithm or method by which content is chosen form media sources.

   The current value is loudest speaker. [this depends entirely on what
   the WG decides]

4.8.  <spatial-description>

   Spatial-description is a general element with sub-elements that
   describe spatial relationships.  As of now, the framework defines
   point-of-capture and capture-area.  We propose a third one here-
   NATIVE-ASPECT-RATIO.

4.8.1.  <point-of-capture>

   Use framework text.

4.8.2.  <capture-area>

   Use framework text.

4.8.3.  <NATIVE-ASPECT_RATIO>

   If a capture has a native aspect ratio (for instance, it corresponds
   to a camera that generates 4:3 video) then it can be supplied here.
   This can help rendering.

4.9.  <audio-channel-format>

   Use framework text.

4.10.  <encoding-group-id>

   This element is a unique numeric value assigned to each encoding
   group by the provider.  It is included in a capture element because
   it links the capture to the group of encodings possible to use for
   the capture.

4.11.  <future-media-capture-attribute>

   This is a placeholder for media capture attributes that have yet to
   be defined.

4.12.  <capture-scene>

   A capture-scene is a description of the captures that the provider is
   capable of sending.  It includes entries which are rows of audio or
   video captures.

   Information concerning the relationship between captures is
   communicated by the capture-scene, that is, an entry in the capture-

   scene signifies a complete representation of the total scene.  When
   there are multiple entries of the same media type in the capture
   scene, this means that each entry is an alternate representation of
   the total scene.

   Some elements of the capture-scene charactize the scene, as for
   example, capture-text.

   An entry is a list of video captures or a list of audio captures, and
   an indication of the switching policy.  Every <entry> element
   contains the following child elements:

   o  <capture-id> See above.
   o  <switch-policy> text from framework.

4.12.1.  <capture-scene-text>

   Text from framework

4.12.2.  <capture-scene-language>

   Text from framework

4.12.3.  <capture-scene-spatial-description>

4.12.3.1.  <capture-scene-area>

   Indicates an overall encompassing co-ordinate "bounding box" at a
   per-capture set level.

4.12.3.2.  capture-scene-scale>

   On a per-capture scene level, this indicates whether the co-ordinates
   used for its media captures are in real-world units, relative units,
   or whether no scale information can be inferred.

4.12.4.  <future-capture-scene-attribute>

   This is a placeholder for capture set attributes that have yet to be
   defined.

4.13.  <simultaneous transmission-set>

   Indicates physical simultaneity constraints.  Use framework text.
   Every <entry> element contains the following child elements:

   o  <capture-id> As above

4.14.  <stream-description>

4.14.1.  <encoding>

4.14.1.1.  <encoding-id>

   Use framework text.  A unique value for the set of encoding
   parameters that constitute an encoding stream..

4.14.1.2.  < MULTIPLEX-ID>

   This element is the means by which the consumer, the receiver of a
   stream, tells the provider which multiplex id to generate that stream
   with, so that the consumer can demultiplex the stream correctly when
   receiving it.

4.14.1.3.  <AUDIO-RENDERING-TAG>

   Optional id for rendering audio supplied by consumer to the provider.
   The provider then uses this tag to to associate an audio stream with
   a video stream.

4.14.1.4.  <max-audio-bandwidth>

   This element gives the bandwidth limit for any audio strea.  It can
   be used in provider advertisements with respect to potential streams,
   or in consumer request messages, describing a stream choice.

4.14.1.5.  <max-video-bandwidth>

   This element gives the provider's bandwidth limit for any video
   stream.  It can be used in provider advertisements with respect to
   potential streams, or in consumer request messages, describing a
   stream choice.

4.14.1.6.  <max-H264-Mbps>

   This element gives the provider's maximum macroblock per second rate
   for any video stream.

4.14.1.7.  <max-width>

   Framework text

4.14.1.8.  <max-height>

   Framework text

4.14.1.9.  <max-frame-rate>

   This element gives a maximum frame rate for a video stream.

4.14.1.10.  <future-encoding-attribute>

4.14.2.  <encoding-group>

   Encoding group is an element used by the provider to describe its
   capabilities.  It groups together the potential encodings that are
   available for a particular capture.  Therefore, a capture has
   associated with with it an encoding-id.

   Every <entry> element contains the following child elements:

   o  A <video-encoding> is an encoding for video.
   o  An <audio-encoding> is an encoding for audio.

4.14.2.1.  <encoding-group-id>

   A unique id for the group of encodings that can be used for a
   particular capture.

4.14.2.2.  <max-group-bandwidth>

   This indicates the maximum bandwidth that the provider can transmit
   for its combined set of active encodings.

4.14.2.3.  <max-group-H264-Mbps>

   The maximum number of macroblocks per second that the provider can
   transmit for its combined set of active encodings.

4.14.2.4.  <future-encoding-group-attribute>

   This is a placeholder for encoding group attributes that have yet to
   be defined.
