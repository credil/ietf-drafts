1.  Introduction


   An Internet IBAN (IIBAN) identifies an internet-based financial
   endpoint.  No assumptions are made about settlement paths, currencies
   or commodities being exchanged, or trust relationships between
   parties.  IBAN provides a building block with which the internet
   community can develop viable, interoperable alternatives to legacy
   financial systems.

   Technically, IIBAN is an unofficial superset of the European
   Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) International Bank Acccount
   Number (IBAN) standard [ISO13616] that is increasingly used in
   conventional global financial networks, including outside of its
   original home of Europe.  Against the IBAN registry [IBAN-REG], IIBAN
   subsumes the position of National Numbering Authority (NNA) for the
   nominal [ISO3166] 'nation' of AA (the Internet) in order to provide a
   financial endpoint registrar service for the internet community.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  Requirement


   In recent years the internet has seen the emergence of an increasing
   variety of online financial settlement scenarios.  Such scenarios
   include web based commerce, high frequency trading (HFT) on stock
   markets, mobile phone 'in app' payments, mobile near field
   communication (NFC) physical proximity-based payments, online banking
   based bill payment, and interpersonal payments within Massive
   Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games (MMORPGs) amongst others.  These
   scenarios vary in at least the following aspects:

    * Typical payment size

    * Acceptable settlement latency

    * Currencies or commodities supported

    * Nature of trust relationships between parties (if any)

    * Requirement for offline operations

   Despite these differences, in each case the need remains to precisely
   identify each of the parties within a transaction.

   Given this trend, it makes sense to propose a standard mechanism for
   the consistent, global identification of internet-based financial
   endpoints.  IIBAN provides such a mechanism.



3.  Solution

3.1.  ISO13616 (IBAN)


   For inspiration we look toward emerging standards for international
   financial endpoint identification in conventional financial networks.
   Today's most widely widely adopted international standard in this
   area is the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS)' IBAN
   [ISO13616], which builds upon the ISO's 2-character country
   identification scheme [ISO3166].

   The format of an IBAN is as follows:

    <ISO3166-1 alpha2 country> + <2 digit checksum> + <BBAN>





Walter Stanish. Payward Inc.                      Section 3.1.  [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 16, 2012            November 2011


   The checksum is calculated as follows:

    1. Set the checksum digits to '00'.

    2. Re-arrange the string such that the BBAN comes first, then
       the country code, and finally the '00' or blank checksum.

    3. Transpose the letters A-Z to the numbers 10-35, expanding
       the string as appropriate.

    4. Convert the string to an integer, ignoring leading zeros.

    5. Calculate the Mod-97 [ISO7064] checksum of the number.

    6. Subtract the checksum from 98 and, if necessary, pad with
       a leading 0 to make a two digit number.

   The BBAN is a nation-specific 'Basic Bank Account Number' that must
   be fixed length for any given nation but whose length may vary
   between nations.  National formats are specified by National
   Numbering Authorities (NNAs).  SWIFT's IBAN registry [IBAN-REG]
   aggregates each national scheme in to the global IBAN standard.



3.2.  IIBAN


   In order to issue financial endpoint identifiers within the IBAN
   [ISO13616] scheme IANA assumes National Numbering Authority (NNA) or
   'nation' status for the nominal nation of 'AA' (the Internet).

   The IIBAN format may be expressed in ABNF [RFC5234] as follows:

    iiban        = "AA" checksum bban          ; eg: AA12011123Z56
    checksum     = 2digit                      ; eg: 12
    bban         = institution account         ; eg: BNK123Z56
    institution  = rsv-inst / std-inst         ; eg: 010 or BNK
    rsv-inst     = "0" 2char                   ; eg: 010
    std-inst     = nonzerochar 2char           ; eg: BNK
    account      = 6char                       ; eg: 123Z56

    char         = digit / letter
    digit        = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" /
                   "9"
    letter       = "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "I" /
                   "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" / "O" / "P" / "Q" / "R" /
                   "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z"

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 16, 2012            November 2011


    nonzerochar  = letter / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" /
                            "8" / "9"

   An explanation of the major elements follows.

   iiban:
     A structurally valid IIBAN.

   checksum:
     Two checksum digits as per the IBAN standard, the algorithm for
     which is described above.  These digits are used to detect
     transposition errors, preventing accidental misrouting.

   bban:
     The Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) is the portion of an IBAN
     defined by a National Numbering Authority (NNA).  In our nominal
     nation of 'AA' (the Internet), the BBAN defines the structure of
     an internet-based financial endpoint as being comprised of a
     three character institution code followed by a six character
     institution-specific endpoint identifier.

   institution:
     The three character institution code identifies either a reserved
     portion of the name space or a registrant of institution status.
     Three characters provides for a total of 46,656 institution codes
     (36^3).  Reserved institution codes are those that begin with zero
     ('0'), whilst all other codes are available for IANA to assign to
     registrants.

     The following table defines reserved institution codes and the
     approximate number of codepoints within their name space.

     +---------+-------------------------------------------+
     | Code    | Purpose                                   |
     +---------+-------------------------------------------+
     | 000-009 | (Reserved for future use)                 |
     | 010     | Private Use (ala IPv4 10.x.x.x [RFC1918]) |
     | 011     | Documentation, public works of fiction    |
     | 012-0ZZ | (Reserved for future use)                 |
     +---------+-------------------------------------------+

   account:
     A six character, institution-specific, institution-assigned
     endpoint identifier.  The identifier length allows for
     2,176,782,336 endpoints (36^6) per institution.

4.  General Considerations

4.1.  Issues of Centralization


   Conventional financial settlement systems typically assign endpoint
   creation, maintenance, and identification responsibility to large
   incumbent players (for example banks, major telecommunications
   carriers, online payment processors, credit card companies, stock
   exchanges or brokerage firms).  In addition, financial settlement
   processes themselves typically occur via a relatively small number of
   relatively centralized networks.

   Whilst this centralized approach is understandable from an historic
   perspective, today its age and drawbacks are becoming more visible.

    * Systems integration and maintenance overheads due to
      disparate endpoint identification schemes, centralized
      endpoint identifier validation and differing prerequisite
      communications security configurations (for example, TLS
      client certificates [RFC5246])

    * Poor fault tolerance. Incumbent players and their
      physical, legal and communications infrastructure
      represent undesirable Single Points of Failure (SPOFs)
      that act to reduce system availability.  Classic
      examples of this are banking services that suspend
      over the weekend, and unpredictable international
      settlement delays due to differing holidays affecting
      financial services in foreign jurisdictions.

    * Potential for abuse. Attackers (or indeed individual
      nation-states or organizations wihin conventional
      centralized financial systems) may consider temptation
      for abuse too great to resist.  Abuses observed include
      constant, passive, warrantless surveillance of entire
      populations [SWIFT2], illegal financial blockade [WL]
      [WL2] and abusive asset seizure [WSJ].

   It is hoped that IIBAN will assist the internet community to develop
   systems that move beyond the above limitations.

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 16, 2012            November 2011


4.2.  Country Code


   In order to issue bank account numbers within the IBAN [ISO13616]
   scheme, National Numbering Authority (NNA) or 'nation' status must be
   assumed.  An appropriate [ISO3166] two letter country code must
   therefore be selected, ideally one that is not either in formal issue
   by the ISO or used informally by various global bodies.

   One such code is 'AA'.  This code is considered particularly
   attractive for the following reasons:

    * It is unlikely that a country will emerge that is best identified
      with 'AA'.  The ISO appears to recognize this fact, since in
      ISO 3166-1 [ISO3166] 'AA' is specified in the series of elements
      for user purposes which the ISO 3166/MA will never issue.

        "If users need code elements to represent country names not
         included in this part of ISO 3166, the series of letters AA,
         QM to QZ, XA to XZ, and ZZ, and the series AAA to AAZ, QMA to
         QZZ, XAA to XZZ, and ZZA to ZZZ respectively and the series of
         numbers 900 to 999 are available."
                                   -- ISO 3166-1:2006, clause 8.1.3,
                                      'User-assigned code elements'.

    * 'AA' will appear above legacy, centralized financial systems in
      alphabetically sorted destination lists

    * Users from international locations in which Roman letters are not
      frequently used are more likely to recognize 'AA' as two of the
      first letter of the Roman alphabet than arbitrary alternatives

    * The letter 'A' tends to have positive connotations

   IIBAN therefore employs 'AA' as a virtual [ISO3166] two letter
   country code to represent the Internet.



4.3.  Institution Identifiers

4.3.1.  Issuing Paradigms

4.3.1.1.  Proxied Issue Schemes


   Conventional financial systems generally require a facilitating
   institution to issue financial endpoint identifiers on behalf of



Walter Stanish. Payward Inc.                  Section 4.3.1.1.  [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: May 16, 2012            November 2011


   participants; for example, banks might issue account numbers on
   behalf of individuals or businesses.  Such de-facto identifier
   issuing paradigms can be described as 'proxied' in that it requires
   participants to approach the network via one of a number of mediators
   in order to obtain a viable financial endpoint.

   Drawbacks to this approach include:

    * Inefficient name space utilization.  Individual institutitons
      are unlikely to achieve complete utilization of endpoint
      identifiers within their delegated name space.

    * Issues of centralized financial systems, described above.

   The benefits of this approach are:

    * Facilitates effective name space delegation to financial
      institutions who might apply differing models or guidelines to
      endpoint identifier issue, therefore encouraging heterogeneity.

    * Already an operational and widely understood/accepted model
      within conventional financial service industries.



4.3.1.2.  Distributed Hash Table (DHT) Schemes


   Using distributed hash tables (DHT) or a similar mechanism it may be
   possible to provide dynamic identifier name space management within a
   financial network itself, such that individual users can self-issue
   IIBANs and have them corroborated by other network participants.

   Drawbacks to this approach include:

    * The 'always on, always connected' requirement of most of these
      architectures.

    * The 'endpoint exposure' problem.
      IP addresses for critical financial systems are generally made
      available to a DHT network, which MAY not be desirable in a
      financial services setting.

    * Name space exhaustion.
      Without some underlying capability for reliable network
      participant identification, a single party could request vast
      quantities of identifiers in a bid to disrupt the network through
      name space exhaustion or processing overhead, causing Denial of

      Service (DoS).

   The primary benefit of this approach is that it is completely
   decentralized, thus avoiding the issues associated with
   centralization (described above).



4.3.1.3.  Private Issue Schemes


   Just as the Internet Protocol provides a mechanism for Address
   Allocation for Private Internets [RFC1918], so too IIBAN provides a
   mechanism for address allocation for private financial networks.
   Private financial networks might include those operated in Massive
   Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games (MMORPGs), financial
   simulations, technical documentation or fictional works of media.

   The reserved institution code '010' is normally used for such
   purposes.

   However, just as the latter two use cases (documentation and media)
   are segregated from the normal name space in standards for both
   telephony [NANPA, OFCOM] and IPv4 addressing [RFC5737], IIBAN also
   maintains a segregated address space (under the '011' reserved
   institution code) for this subset of private issue purposes.



4.3.1.4.  IIBAN's Combined Issue Scheme


   The benefits and drawbacks of various issuing paradigms have already
   been discussed.  IIBAN's combined issue paradigm allows the balancing
   of these against other requirements, such as IANA's need to perform
   name space management.  Under this scheme, proxied issue is
   facilitated through IANA managed institution registration, provision
   for two types of privately issued addresses is reserved within this
   document, and registered institutions COULD provide DHT or similar
   mechanisms for the management of their delegated name space.  The
   combined issue paradigm offers adequate provision for both
   manageability and decentralization, whilst maintaining heterogeneity.

4.3.2.  Why Institutions?


   With the advent of decentralized virtual currencies such as [BITCOIN]
   the conventional idea of a financial institution (such as a bank) may
   be seen by some as somewhat superfluous.  However, the notion remains
   useful:

    * Conventional currencies will not disappear in the conceivable
      future, so the notion of financial institutions is expected
      to endure at least as providers of currency exchange and holding
      services.

    * Systems such as [BITCOIN] have quirks that require slightly
      delayed settlement due to the nature of their decentralized,
      consensus-based approach to fiscal transfer.  Users requiring
      instant settlement MAY thus see benefit in the use of a
      centralized proxy system or organization as an instantaneous
      financial settlement provider (the 'institution').

    * IANA MAY delegate management of portions of the IIBAN name space
      through such institutions.



4.3.3.  Number of Institutions


   The current global SWIFT BIC [ISO9362] system used for international
   inter-institution transaction addressing is reported to possess over
   7,500 'live' codes, and an additional 10,000 codes that may be used
   for manual transactions.  We therefore assume a requirement to
   support at least 15-20,000 institution identifiers within the IIBAN
   system.  More than double this number has been provided for.



4.3.4.  Number of Endpoints per Institution


   With the exception of India and China, the largest nations'
   populations are all well below 1 billion.  We provide over two
   billion endpoints per institution, which should be more than
   adequate.

4.3.5.  Intra-Institution Routing


   In reference to routing identifiers used in most conventional
   financial networks (such as 'sort code' or 'branch code'), intra-
   institution routing identifiers have been purposefully excluded from
   IIBAN.

   Institutions MAY create their own address space segmentation schemes
   in the event that they wish to divide financial endpoints between
   disparate physical or logical systems, however it is observed that
   this relic of an earlier financial era of disconnected systems will
   probably be gradually phased out over time - at least as a public-
   facing identifier.



4.4.  BBAN Length


   BBAN lengths in the official registry [IBAN-REG] seem to be
   determined solely by National Numbering Authorities (NNAs) and appear
   to have no specific length limitation. In practice, however, they
   vary between about 11 and 26 characters.  To avoid issues of
   backwards compatibility with existing systems, exceeding this limit
   is undesirable.

   Existing NNAs seem to determine BBAN formats simply by concatenating
   existing national account identifiers such as institution, branch and
   account number.  Because these numbers are typically very old they
   are often longer than strictly required because legacy identifiers:

    * Are sometimes numeric only (ie: do not include letters), or a
      significant portion of the BBAN is numeric only.

    * Often include secondary checksums that were instituted to avoid
      financial endpoint transposition errors in the days prior to
      electronic banking.  Such secondary checksums are no longer
      required for non-legacy transactions due to IBAN's built-in
      checksum feature.

   Thus by allowing alphanumeric values for each character and relying
   solely upon IBAN's checksum, IIBAN increases the effective capacity
   of an identifier without increasing its length.

5.  Implementation Considerations

   Implementers SHOULD aim to accept both IIBAN and IBAN equally in all
   cases, such that end users are NOT aware of any difference between
   the standards.


6.  Security Considerations

   IIBAN only provides an endpoint identification scheme and DOES NOT
   approach problems of communications security, which are purposefully
   left to other protocols.  Even so, some security considerations are
   are pertinent.


6.1.  Non-Linear Issue

   To preserve the anonymity of clients and to refrain from leaking
   information about the number of financial endpoints created over a
   given period, institutions SHOULD refrain from issuing IIBAN in a
   sequential manner.  Instead, a random or semi-random sequence of
   issue SHOULD be adopted.


6.2.  Validation

   IBAN [ISO13616] and, by extension, IIBAN provide checksum digits for
   algorithmic identifier validation.  Implementers MUST be aware that
   the checksum is intended primarily for the early detection of
   transposition errors.  An IIBAN passing the checksum SHOULD be
   referred to as 'checksum-valid' and does NOT necessarily exist.  It
   MUST NOT be considered otherwise valid.

   In addition, for the purposes of efficiency pre-checkum validation
   MAY be executed.  Such validation MAY based upon one or both of the
   length and structure of the IIBAN.  An IIBAN passing such validation
   SHOULD be referred to as 'structure-valid' and does NOT necessarily
   exist.  It MUST NOT be considered otherwise valid.

   The only way to completely validate an IIBAN or IBAN is with the
   issuing institution.


6.3.  IANA Processes

   IANA MUST provide adequate authentication of registrant institution
   communications in order to prevent the subversion of established
   institutions' registration information via IANA's registrar

   functions.



7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Institution Identifiers

7.1.1.  Name Space Exhaustion

   Should the entire 'AA' name space approach registration, IANA may
   look to subsume an additional [ISO3166] country prefix from those
   reserved by the ISO for user assignment.


7.1.2.  Registration

   Institution identifiers MUST be assigned by IANA on a first come
   first served basis [RFC5226].  Institution identifiers SHOULD NOT be
   provided to entities capable of issuing IBAN in conventional
   financial networks as this would represent duplicate allocation under
   the IBAN standard.  Such entities MUST be defined as those offering
   banking services in countries that appear within the IBAN registry
   [IBAN-REG], with definitions of those terms being solely of IANA's
   own judgement.  Registrants MUST provide the domain name with which
   their service is primarily associated and the name of the registrant
   (either a person or an organizational entity).  Registrants MAY
   provide a physical address, and MAY provide one additional identifier
   such as a business registration or license number.

   Institution identifiers MUST be assigned randomly from the pool of
   available assignments and MUST NOT be granted on a specific request
   basis.  Thus, the first issued institution code MUST NOT be '100'.
   Institutions unhappy with their random assignment for legitimate
   reasons (such as unfortunate linguistic connotations) MAY request one
   (1) replacement assignment.  No further replacement is allowed.
   Registrants requesting replacement assignments automatically cause
   their initial allocation to expire (see Expiry, below).


7.1.3.  Modification / Cancellation

   Registrants MUST contact IANA to cancel or change the details
   associated with their registration.  Authentication procedures will
   be stipulated at IANA's discression.

7.1.4.  Expiry

   In case of imminent name space exhaustion and no viable alternative
   avenues for expansion, IANA MAY consider the expiry of a registrant's
   stated primary domain for a reasonable period (as determined by IANA)
   as adequate grounds for the deallocation of an instutition
   identifier.  Deallocated identifiers MUST be immediately returned to
   the pool of available allocations, and MUST be re-issued to new
   parties on a first come, first served [RFC5226] basis.


7.2.  Publications


7.2.1.  IIBAN Institution Identifier Registry

   IANA SHALL publish revisions to the global registry of IIBAN
   institution identifiers as changes are made.  The registry SHALL
   include date of registration and date of last modification of each
   record, in addition to registrant information and the assigned
   institution code.


7.3.  ISO Liason

   On account of IIBAN's exclusive use of IBAN's reserved, user assigned
   name space, no ISO liason should be required.


7.4.  Security

   IANA MUST provide adequate authentication of registrant institution
   communications in order to prevent the subversion of established
   institutions' registration information via IANA's registrar
   functions.  As IANA is likely to have superior experience in this
   domain, specific procedures are left to IANA's judgement.
