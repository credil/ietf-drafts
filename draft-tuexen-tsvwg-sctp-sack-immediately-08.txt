Internet-Draft              SACK-IMMEDIATELY                October 2011


1.  Introduction

   According to [RFC4960] the receiver of a DATA chunk should use
   delayed SACKs.  This delaying is completely controlled by the
   receiver of the DATA chunk.

   In specific situations the delaying of SACKs results in reduced
   performance of the protocol.  If such a situation can be detected by
   the receiver, the corresponding SACK can be sent immediately.  For
   example, [RFC4960] recommends the immediate sending if the receiver
   has detected message loss or message duplication.  However, if the
   situation can only be detected by the sender of the DATA chunk,
   [RFC4960] provides no method of avoiding the delaying of the SACK.
   Thus the protocol performance might be reduced.

   This document overcomes this limitation and describes a simple
   extension of the SCTP DATA chunk by defining a new flag, the I-bit.
   The sender of a DATA chunk indicates by setting this bit that the
   corresponding SACK chunk should not be delayed.

   Upper layers of SCTP using the socket API as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket] may subscribe to the
   SCTP_SENDER_DRY_EVENT for getting a notification as soon as no user
   data is outstanding anymore.  To avoid an unnecessary delay while
   waiting for such an event, the application might set the I-Bit on the
   last DATA chunk sent before waiting for the event.  This enabling is
   possible using the extension of the socket API described in
   Section 6.

   There are also situations in which the SCTP implementation can set
   the I-bit without interacting with the upper layer.  If the
   association is in the SHUTDOWN-PENDING state, the I-bit should be
   set.  This reduces the number of simultaneous associations in case of
   a busy server handling short living associations.  Another case is
   where the sending of a DATA chunk fills the congestion or receiver
   window.  Setting the I-bit in these cases improves the throughput of
   the transfer.

                   Figure 1: Extended DATA chunk format

   The only difference between the DATA chunk in Figure 1 and the DATA
   chunk defined in [RFC4960] is the addition of the I-bit in the flags
   field of the chunk header.


4.  Procedures

4.1.  Sender Side Considerations

   Whenever the sender of a DATA chunk can benefit from the
   corresponding SACK chunk being sent back without delay, the sender
   MAY set the I-bit in the DATA chunk header.  Please note that it is
   irrelevant to the receiver why the sender has set the I-bit.

   Reasons for setting the I-bit include but are not limited to the
   following:

   o  The application requests to set the I-bit of the last DATA chunk
      of a user message when providing the user message to the SCTP
      implementation (see Section 6).

   o  The sender is in the SHUTDOWN-PENDING state.

   o  The sending of a DATA chunk fills the congestion or receiver
      window.

4.2.  Receiver Side Considerations

   On reception of an SCTP packet containing a DATA chunk with the I-bit
   set, the receiver SHOULD NOT delay the sending of the corresponding
   SACK chunk and SHOULD send it back immediately.


5.  Interoperability Considerations

   According to [RFC4960] the receiver of a DATA chunk with the I-bit
   set should ignore this bit when it does not support the extension
   described in this document.  Since the sender of the DATA chunk is
   able to handle this case, there is no requirement for negotiating the
   support of the feature described in this document.


6.  Socket API Considerations

   This section describes how the socket API defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket] is extended to provide a way for the
   application to set the I-bit.

   Please note that this section is informational only.

   A socket API implementation based on [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket] is
   extended by supporting a flag called SCTP_SACK_IMMEDIATELY, which can
   be set in the snd_flags field of the struct sctp_sndinfo structure or
   the sinfo_flags field of the struct sctp_sndrcvinfo structure, which
   is deprecated.

   If the SCTP_SACK_IMMEDIATELY flag is set when sending a user message,
   the I-bit of the last DATA chunk of the corresponding user message is
   set.


7.  IANA Considerations

   [NOTE to RFC-Editor:

      "RFCXXXX" is to be replaced by the RFC number you assign this
      document.

   ]

   Following the chunk flag registration procedure defined in [RFC6096]
   IANA should register a new bit, the I-bit, for the DATA chunk.  The
   suggested value is 0x08.  The reference for the new chunk flag in the
   chunk flags table for the DATA chunk available at sctp-parameters [1]

   should be RFCXXXX.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add any additional security considerations in
   addition to the ones given in [RFC4960].
