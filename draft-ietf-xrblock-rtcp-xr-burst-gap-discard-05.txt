1.  Introduction

1.1.  Burst and Gap Discard Report Block

   This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the proportion of packets discarded by the
   receiver due to jitter.  The discards during discard bursts are
   reported, together with the number of bursts.  This block is intended
   to be used in conjunction with [DISCARD] which provides the total
   packets discarded, and on which this block therefore depends.
   However the metric in [DISCARD] may be used independently of the
   metrics in this block.

   This block provides information on transient IP problems.  Burst/Gap
   metrics are typically used in Cumulative reports however MAY be used
   in Interval reports.  The burstiness of packet discard affects user
   experience, may influence any sender strategies to mitigate the
   problem, and may also have diagnostic value.

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related terminal metrics
   defined in [MONARCH].

   The definitions of Burst, Gap, Loss and Discard are consistent with
   definitions in [RFC3611].  To accommodate the range of jitter buffer
   algorithms and packet discard logic that may be used by implementors,
   the method used to distinguish between bursts and gaps may be an
   equivalent method to that defined in[RFC3611].

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block.  The
   use of Extended Report blocks is defined by [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions or
   define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines in
   [RFC6390].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications which
   don't use stream repair means.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Received, Lost and Discarded

      A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to arrive within an
      implementation-specific time window.  A packet that arrives within
      this time window but is too early or late to be played out or
      thrown away before playout due to packet duplication or redundancy
      shall be regarded as discarded.  A packet shall be classified as
      one of received (or OK), discarded or lost.  The metric
      "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in [RFC3550] reports a
      count of packets lost from the media stream (single SSRC within
      single RTP session).  Similarly the metric "number of packets
      discarded" defined in [DISCARD] reports a count of packets
      discarded from the media stream (single SSRC within single RTP
      session) arriving at the receiver.  Another metric defined in
      [RFC5725] is available to report on packets which are not
      recovered by any repair techniques which may be in use.


   Bursts and Gaps

      The terms Burst and Gap are used in a manner consistent with that
      of RTCP XR [RFC3611].  RTCP XR views a RTP stream as being divided
      into bursts, which are periods during which the discard rate is
      high enough to cause noticeable quality degradation (generally
      over 5 percent discard rate), and gaps, which are periods during
      which discarded packets are infrequent and hence quality is
      generally acceptable.

3.  Burst/Gap Discard Block

   Metrics in this block report on Burst/Gap Discard in the stream
   arriving at the RTP system.

3.2.  Definition of Fields in Burst/Gap Discard Report Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Burst/Gap Discard Report Block is identified by the constant
      NBGD.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NBGD with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the Burst/Gap Discard
      metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is,
      whether the reported values applies to the most recent measurement
      interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=10) (the
      Interval Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=11) (the Cumulative Duration) or is a
      sampled instantaneous value (I=01) (Sampled Value).  In this
      document, Burst/Gap Discard Metric is not measured at a particular
      time instant but over one or several reporting intervals.
      Therefore Burst/Gap Discard Metric MUST NOT be chosen as Sampled
      Metric.

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR Burst/Gap Discard              July 2012


   Reserved (resv): 6 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to zero by senders
      and MUST be ignored by receivers.


   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Burst/Gap discard block, the block length is equal to 3.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].


   Threshold: 8 bits

      The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e. the number
      of successive packets that must not be discarded prior to and
      following a discard packet in order for this discarded packet to
      be regarded as part of a gap.


   Packets discarded in bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
      be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.


   Total packets expected in bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets expected during discarded bursts (that
      is, the sum of received packets and lost packets).

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
      be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.


   Reserved (resv): 8 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to zero by senders
      and MUST be ignored by receivers.

3.3.  Derived metrics based on reported metrics

   The metrics described here are intended to be used in conjunction
   with information from the Measurement Information block [MEASID],
   discard block [DISCARD] (which MUST be present in the same RTCP
   packet as the Burst/Gap Discard block).

   These metrics provides the following information relevant to
   statistical parameters, including:

   o  The fraction of packets discarded during bursts (burst discard
      rate in [SUMSTAT])

   o  The fraction of packets discarded during gaps (gap discard rate in
      [SUMSTAT])

   The details on calculation these parameters in the metrics are
   described in [SUMSTAT].

4.  Considerations for Voice-over-IP applications

   This metric block is applicable to a broad range of RTP applications.
   Where the metric is used with a Voice-overIP (VoIP) application and
   the stream repair means is not available, the following
   considerations apply.

   RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
   during which the discard rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
   quality degradation (generally over 5 percent discard rate), and
   gaps, which are periods during which discarded packets are infrequent
   and hence call quality is generally acceptable.

   If Voice Activity Detection is used the Burst and Gap Duration shall
   be determined as if silence packets had been sent, i.e. a period of
   silence in excess of Gmin packets MUST terminate a burst condition.

   The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in [RFC3611] results in
   a Burst being a period of time during which the call quality is
   degraded to a similar extent to a typical PCM Severely Errored Second
   [PSES].

5.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format =/ xr-bgd-block

   xr-bgd-block = "brst-gap-dscrd"

6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

6.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NBGD in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NBGD with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

6.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "brst-gap-dscrd" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

6.3.  Contact information for registrations


   The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
