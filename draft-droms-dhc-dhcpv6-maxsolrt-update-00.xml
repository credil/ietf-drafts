      <t>This document updates RFC 3315 by redefining the default
      value for SOL_MAX_RT and defining an option through which a
      DHCPv6 server can override the client's default value for
      SOL_MAX_RT with a new value.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Section 5.5 of the <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6
      specification</xref> defines the default value of MAX_SOL_RT to
      be 120 seconds.  In some circumstances, this default will lead
      to an unacceptably high volume of aggregated traffic at a DHCPv6
      server.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

    <section title="Update to RC 3315">
      <t>This document changes section 5.5 of RFC 3315 as follows:

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
OLD:
   SOL_MAX_RT      120 secs  Max Solicit timeout value

NEW:
   SOL_MAX_RT     3600 secs  Max Solicit timeout value
         ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>

      <t>With this change, a DHCPv6 client that does not receive a
      satisfactory response will send Solicit messages with the same
      initial frequency and exponential backoff as specified in RFC
      3315.  However, the long term behavior of these DHCPv6 clients
      will be to send a Solicit message every 3600 seconds rather than
      every 120 seconds, significantly reducing the aggregated traffic
      at the DHCPv6 server.</t>

      <t>The change to MAX_SOL_RT is in response to DHCPv6 message
      rates observed at a DHCPv6 server in a deployment in which many
      DHCPv6 clients are sending Solicit messages but the DHCPv6
      server has been configured not to respond to those Solicit
      messages.  RFC 3315 was written with the expectation that the
      'M' and 'O' flags in <xref target="RFC2461">NDP</xref> would
      control the use of DHCPv6 by hosts.  However, the current
      definition of the 'M' and 'O' flags in <xref
      target="RFC4861">RFC 4861</xref> does not explicitly preclude
      the use of DHCPv6 by a host.  Some devices are specified to
      initiate DHCPv6 even if RAs are received with the 'M' and 'O'
      bits set to 0.  In some circumstances, it is desirable to enable
      the assignment of IPv6 addresses through DHCPv6 to some nodes on
      a link but not to others, which cannot be implemented through
      the 'M' and 'O' bits.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="SOL_MAX_RT option">
      <t>A DHCPv6 server sends the SOL_MAX_RT option to a client to
      override the default value of SOL_MAX_RT.  One use for the
      SOL_MAX_RT option is to set a longer value for SOL_MAX_RT, which
      reduces the Solicit traffic from a client that has not received
      any IPv6 addresses.</t>

      <t>The format of the SOL_MAX_RT option is:

      <t>If the DHCPv6 server declines to assign any addresses to a
      client in an IA_NA or IA_TA option, it MAY include a SOL_MAX_RT
      option in the appropriate options field along with a Status Code
      option indicating NoAddrsAvail.</t>

      <t>If a DHCPv6 client receives an IA_NA or IA_TA option
      containing a SOL_MAX_RT option, the client MUST set its internal
      SOL_MAX_RT parameter to the value contained in the SOL_MAX_RT
      option.</t>
    </section>
  
    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document introduces one security considerations
      beyond those described in RFC 3315.  A malicious DHCPv6 server
      might cause a client to set its SOL_MAX_RT parameter to an
      arbitrarily high value with the SOL_MAX_RT option.  Assuming
      the client also receives a response from a valid DHCPv6 server,
      the large value for SOL_MAX_RT will not have any effect.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to assign an options code from the "DHCP
      Option Codes" Registry for OPTION_MAX_SOL_RT.</t>
