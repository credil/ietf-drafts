Abstract

   Flowspec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination of
   traffic flow specifications. This has several applications, but one
   of key interest to many network operators is network-wide
   distribution of traffic filtering rules as part of a threat
   mitigation strategy.

   Every flowspec route is effectively a rule, consisting of a matching
   part (encoded in the NLRI field) and an action part. The current
   standards support common filter actions including discard, rate
   limit, sample, etc. and all of these actions are encoded in BGP
   extended communities. For policy-based forwarding the current
   standards also define a redirect-to-VRF action (again encoded in a
   BGP extended community), but for some flowspec applications this can
   be complex to implement, particularly in networks where L3 VPNs are
   not prevalent.

   This draft proposes a generalized flowspec redirect action that
   allows a more complete set of policy-based forwarding actions to be
   signaled with a flowspec route. This generalized action is encoded in
   a BGP path attribute and uses a TLV-style encoding for future
   extensibility. Two redirect action TLVs are defined in this draft:
   one for redirecting matched packets towards a remote IPv4 destination
   and the other for redirecting matched packets towards a remote IPv6
   destination. Many routers already support these filter actions in the
   datapath and so the proposed flowspec extensions are simply filling a
   control plane gap.

1. Introduction

   Flowspec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination of
   traffic flow specifications. This has several applications, but one
   of key interest to many network operators is network-wide
   distribution of traffic filtering rules as part of a threat
   mitigation strategy.

   Every flowspec route is effectively a rule, consisting of a matching
   part (encoded in the NLRI field) and an action part. The current
   standards support common filter actions including discard, rate
   limit, sample, etc. and all of these actions are encoded in BGP
   extended communities. For policy-based forwarding the current
   standards also define a redirect-to-VRF action (again encoded in a
   BGP extended community), but for some flowspec applications this can
   be complex to implement, particularly in networks where L3 VPNs are
   not prevalent.

   This draft proposes a generalized flowspec redirect action that
   allows a more complete set of policy-based forwarding actions to be
   signaled with a flowspec route. This generalized action is encoded in
   a BGP path attribute and uses a TLV-style encoding for future
   extensibility. Two redirect action TLVs are defined in this draft:
   one for redirecting matched packets towards a remote IPv4 destination
   and the other for redirecting matched packets towards a remote IPv6
   destination. Many routers already support these filter actions in the
   datapath and so the proposed flowspec extensions are simply filling a
   control plane gap.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

3. The Generalized Flowspec Redirect Attribute

   All of the actions defined in the current flowspec standards,
   [RFC5575] and [IPv6-FLOW], are encoded using BGP extended
   communities. While it would be desirable to define new BGP extended
   communities for the new types of redirect action called for in this
   document the maximum length of extended communities (7 octets of
   data) makes this very limiting.

   This document therefore proposes a new BGP path attribute called the
   Generalized Flowspec Redirect Attribute. It is a transitive, optional
   attribute of non-extended length. The value field of the path

   attribute contains exactly one Redirect Action TLV, which has the
   structure shown in Figure 1.

                            Redirect Action TLV

                                 Figure 1



   The Redirect Action TLV has the following fields:

   - Type: A single octet encoding the TLV Type.  Only type 1, "Remote
   IPv4 Address", and type 2 "Remote IPv6 Address" are defined in this
   document.

   - Length: A single octet encoding the length in octets of the TLV,
   including the type and length fields. The length is encoded as an
   unsigned binary integer.

   - Value: A value field that contains type-dependent data. In a type 1
   "Remote IPv4 Address" TLV the value field contains a 4-octet AS value
   followed by a 4-octet IPv4 address. In a type 2 "Remote IPv6 Address"
   TLV the value field contains a 4-octet AS value followed by a 16-
   octet IPv6 address.

   When a system originates a flowspec route with the intent to redirect
   matched packets to a remote IPv4 address, it includes a Generalized
   Flowspec Redirect Attribute containing a "Remote IPv4 Address"
   Redirect Action TLV (type 1). The AS number in the TLV MUST be the AS
   number of the associated IPv4 address (this will typically be the
   same as the originator's AS number) or 0, if the AS number is unknown
   to the originator. A 2-octet ASN is encoded in the low-order 2 octets
   of the AS number field. The IPv4 address in the TLV is any routable
   /32 unicast IPv4 address.

   When a system originates a flowspec route with the intent to redirect
   matched packets to a remote IPv6 address, it includes a Generalized
   Flowspec Redirect Attribute containing a "Remote IPv6 Address"
   Redirect Action TLV (type 2). The AS number in the TLV MUST be the AS
   number of the associated IPv6 address (this will typically be the
   same as the originator's AS number) or 0, if the AS number is unknown
   to the originator. A 2-octet ASN is encoded in the low-order 2 octets
   of the AS number field. The IPv6 address in the TLV is any routable
   /128 unicast IPv6 address.

   A flowspec route MUST NOT have more than one Generalized Flowspec
   Redirect Attribute. Error handling must follow the procedures
   outlined in [OPT-TRANS].

   A flowspec route that has a Generalized Flowspec Redirect Attribute
   in addition to one or more of the BGP extended community actions
   defined in [RFC5575] and [IPV6-FLOW] is valid but implementations MAY
   choose to ignore some or all of the BGP extended community actions
   when installing a filter entry for this type of route.

   A router that receives a flowspec route with a Generalized Flowspec
   Redirect Attribute MAY check that the AS number in the Redirect
   Action TLV (if non-zero) is the origin AS associated with its route
   to the indicated remote IP address. In this case, if the AS numbers
   are found to be different the router SHOULD NOT install a filter
   entry for the flowspec route.

   When a router receives and installs a flowspec route with a
   Generalized Flowspec Redirect Attribute the resultant filter entry
   should forward matched packets to the interface that is the IP next-
   hop towards the signaled "Remote IPv4 Address" or "Remote IPv6
   Address". The remote address may be any number of IP forwarding next-
   hops away from the router installing the flowspec route. In certain
   deployments the IP next-hop towards the remote IP address may be an
   IP or MPLS tunnel.

4. Security Considerations

   TBD

5. IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA allocate a new BGP path attribute
   type number for the Generalized Flowspec Redirect Attribute. IANA
   should also establish and maintain a registry for Redirect Action
   TLVs and indicate the meaning of type 1 and type 2 in this context.
