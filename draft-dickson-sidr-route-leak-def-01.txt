                       Route Leaks -- Definitions
                  draft-dickson-sidr-route-leak-def-01

Abstract

   The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the means to
   advertise reachability for IP prefixes.  This reachability
   information is propagated in a peer-to-peer topology.  Sometimes
   routes are announced to peers for which the local peering policy does
   not permit.  And sometimes routes are propagated indiscriminantly,
   once they have been accepted.

   This document considers the situations that can lead to routes being
   leaked, and tries to find acceptable definitions for describing these
   scenarios.

   The purpose of these definitions is to facilitate analysis of what a
   route leak is, and what the scope of the problem space for route
   leaks is.

   This, in turn, is intended to inform a requirements document for
   detection of (and prevention of) route leaks.  And finally, the
   definitions and requirements are intended to allow proposed solutions
   which meet these criteria, and to facilitate evaluation of proposed
   solutions.

   The fundamental objective is to "solve the route leaks problem".

Internet-Draft           Route Leak Definitions               March 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Rationale

   A route-leak occurs when a prefix is originated by one party,
   propagated by other parties, and received by the observer, where the
   path used was not intentional end-to-end.  It is a leak if the
   receiver did not want the route, from a generic policy perspective.
   It does not matter which party caused the situation - a leak is in
   the eye of the receiver.  By their nature - unintentional, unwanted,
   and harmful, route leaks are bad.

   By first establishing a more precise definition of route leak, the
   intent is to find requirements for mechanisms for stopping route
   leaks, and then finding solutions that meet those requirements.

1.2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with BGP version 4, both from a
   protocol perspective and from an operational perspective.  BGP4 is
   defined in [RFC1771], and updated or enhanced by a variety of other
   RFCs.

   The following terminology is used throughout this document:

   Route (or synonomously, prefix): an NLRI in BGP, including all its
   attributes.

   Neighbor (or "peer", not capitalized): A toplogically adjacent
   Autonomous System, with whom routes are exchanged.

   Link: A BGP connection to a Neighbor.  A Neighbor may be reached via
   one or more links.

   Link Classification: The "intent" of a given BGP peering session,
   which addresses only the categories of route announced and accepted,
   and which is further modified by Local Policy.

   Local Policy: The set of rules, as applied on a single Neighbor Link,
   on which routes are announced, which routes are accepted, and what
   attributes are changed to affect choice of BGP Best Path per prefix.

Internet-Draft           Route Leak Definitions               March 2012


   Path: Also known as AS Path, the sequence of ASNs through which a
   route has passed from Originator to recipient.

   Hijacked Route: A route which has been originated by a party other
   than the owner of the prefix.  This could be via a forged ASN, or
   from another ASN.

   Validated Origination: a route whose origination has been validated
   via cryptographic means, using an ROA.

   Link Classifications: a Link may be classified as:

   o  Customer

   o  Transit

   o  Peer

   o  Mutual Transit


2.  Scope Limitations

   The following issues are not in the scope of route leaks.  Each item
   in the list includes the rationale for excluding it.

   Hijacked Routes:
      Origin Validation already addresses the issue of Hijacked Routes.
      By limiting Route Leak efforts to Validated Routes, we are able to
      presume the origin is correct.

   Violations of Local Policy:
      Issues between adjacent ASNs which do not propogate any further,
      or which do not violate the Link Classification.

   Other-ASN Relationship:
      The "correctness" of a given prefix received over a Link, is
      determined only by the Link Classifications of each Link in the
      Path.  The existence of other Links, to Neighbors with ASNs on a
      given Path (which may have differing Link Classifications), is a
      classic "apples to oranges" comparision.  It is incorrect to
      compare ASNs outside the context of the AS path, so we exclude
      those comparisons from this work.

   Essentially, the only elements being considered are the Path, and
   Link Classifications at each hop in the Path.

3.  Route Leak Definitions

   Route Leak Initiation: A Route announced over a Link by a Neighbor
   which does not match the Link Classification, where the Neighbor is
   either the Originator, or had received the Route where the Neighbor's
   Link Classification matched the Route that the Neighbor received.  In
   lay terms, this means that the Neighbor is the party that caused the
   route leak, by announcing a route contrary to the Link Classification
   (and consequently also violated the Local Policy).

   Route Leak Propagation: A Route announced over a Link by a Neighbor,
   where the Neighbor received the Route as either a Route Leak
   Initiation, or a Route Leak Propagation.  A Route Leak Propagation
   may appear to match the Link Classification, since the Path appears
   similar to non-leaked routes for the first two ASNs in the Path.

3.1.  Peer Links and Routes

   A Peer Classification is a Link over which the two parties send only
   their respective Customer Routes (and their Customer's Routes, and so
   on).

   A Link which is classified as a Peer, will see us as a Peer
   Classification as well.  The relationship is symmetric in nature.

3.2.  Customer Links and Routes

   A Customer Link Classification: The Customer sends us only their own
   Routes, and the Customer's Customer's Routes (and Customer^Nth
   Routes).  The Customer relationship is transitive.

   A Transit Link Classification: The Transit provider sends all Routes.
   This include the Transit Provider's Customers, the Transit Provider's
   Peers, and if there are any, the Transit Provider's Transit
   Provider's Routes.  The Transit Provider relationship is also
   transitive.

   Transit and Customer are the opposite ends of the same Link, by
   definition.

   The Customer Classification is a superset of the actual Local Policy
   of a specific Customer.  This means that while a Customer
   Classification means "we send all routes", the actual Local Policy
   for a specific Customer might differ, and the Customer might only
   receive some Routes, or none at all.  Similarly, the Classification
   means that we are prepared to accept the Customer's own Routes, as
   well as those of the Customer's Customers.  However, the Local Policy
   might be to accept only a specific subset of the Customer's Routes.

Internet-Draft           Route Leak Definitions               March 2012


3.2.1.  Customer's Customer

   It is important to define when a Route is a Customer's Customer
   Route.

   A Customer's Customer Route: the Path to be from the Customer's
   Customer, to the Customer, to us.  Similarly, Customer^Nth Paths must
   proceed directly from Customer^N to Customer^(N-1) to Customer to us.
   It is not sufficient for the Origin of the Route to be the ASN of a
   Customer's Customer.  Each Link must be a Customer Classification, or
   Mutual Transit, which is a superset of Customer.

3.3.  Mutual Transit

   A Mutual Transit Classification is a Link where the two parties agree
   to provide full routes, and to advertise each others' customers
   routes the same as they would advertise their own customers' routes.
   Semantically, this behaves the same as having two Links where one is
   Transit and the other is Customer.

3.4.  Non-Initiation Links

   To help identify the exact conditions where a Route Leak Initiation
   can occur, it is helpful to exclude Link Classifications where it is
   not possible to cause a Route Leak Initiation.

   A Transit Classification, by definition, can receive all routes.

   Thus, a Transit Classification Link cannot be the source of a Route
   Leak Initiation.

   By the same logic, a Mutual Transit Classification cannot be the
   source of a Route Leak Initiation.

   This leads to a more precise definition of a Route Leak Initiation.

3.5.  Route Leak Initiation

   Route Leak Initiation: Non-Customer Route received over a Peer or
   Customer Link.

3.6.  Route Leak

   Route Leak: any Route where, somewhere in the Path, a Non-Customer
   Route was received over a Peer or Customer Link.  (This is synomous
   with "was sent over a Peer or Transit Link".)
