1. Introduction

   OAM (Operations, Administration and Maintenance) generally covers
   various production aspects of a network. In this document we use the
   term OAM as defined in [RFC6291].

   Success of network operations depends on the ability to proactively
   monitor it for faults, performance, etc. as well as the ability to
   efficiently and quickly troubleshoot defects and failures.  A well-
   defined OAM toolset is a vital requirement for wider adoption of
   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) as the next
   generation data forwarding technology in larger networks such as
   data centers.

   In this document we define the requirements for TRILL OAM. It is
   assumed that the readers are familiar with the OAM concepts and
   terminologies defined in other OAM standards such as [8021ag] and
   [RFC5860]. This document does not attempt to redefine the terms and
   concepts specified elsewhere.

1.1. Scope

   The scope of this document is OAM between RBridges of a TRILL campus
   over links selected by TRILL routing.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].
   Although this document is not a protocol specification, the use of
   this language clarifies the instructions to protocol designers
   producing solutions that satisfy the requirements set out in this
   document.

3. Terminology

   Section: The term Section refers to a segment of a path between any
   two given RBridges. As an example, consider the case where RB1 is
   connected to RBx via RB2,RB3 and RB4. The segment between RB2 to RB4
   is referred to as a Section of the path RB1 to RBx. More details of
   "section" definition can be found in [RFC5960]

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements             January 2013


   Flow: The term Flow indicates a set of packets that share the same
   path and per-hop behavior (such as priority). A flow is typically
   identified by a portion of the inner payload that affects the hop-by
   hop forwarding decisions. This may contain Layer 2 through Layer 4
   information.

   All Selectable Least Cost Paths: The term "all selectable least cost
   paths" refers to a subset of all potentially available least cost
   paths to a specified destination RBridge that are available (and
   usable) for forwarding of frames. It is important to note, in
   practice, due to limitations in implementations, not all available
   least cost paths may be selectable for forwarding.

   Connectivity: The term connectivity indicates reachability between
   an arbitrary RBridge RB1 and any other RBridge RB2. The specific
   path can be either explicit (i.e. associated with a specific flow)
   or unspecified. Unspecified means that messages used for
   connectivity verification take whatever path the RBs happen to
   select. Please refer to [OAMOVER] for details.

   Continuity Verification: Continuity Verification refers to proactive
   verification of liveliness between two RBridges at periodic
   intervals and generation of explicit notification when Connectivity
   failures occur. Please refer to [OAMOVER] for details.

   Fault: The term Fault refers to an inability to perform a required
   action, e.g., an unsuccessful attempt to deliver a packet. Please
   refer to [TERMTP] for definition.

   Defect: The term Defect refers to an interruption in the normal
   operation, such that over a period of time no packets are delivered
   successfully. Please refer to [TERMTP] for definition.

   Failure: The term Failure refers to the termination of the required
   function over a longer period of time. Persistence of a defect for a
   period of time is interpreted as a failure. Please refer to [TERMTP]
   for definition.

   Simulated Flow: The term simulated flow refers to a sequence of OAM
   generated packets designed to follow a specific path. The fields of
   the packets in the simulated flow may or may not be identical to the
   fields of data packets of an actual flow being simulated. However,
   the purpose of the simulated flow is to have OAM packets of the
   simulated flow follow a specific path.

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements             January 2013


4. OAM Requirements

4.1. Data Plane

   OAM frames, utilized for connectivity verification, continuity
   checks, performance measurements, etc., will by default take
   whatever path TRILL chooses based on the current topology and per-
   hop equal cost path choices. In some cases, it may be required that
   the OAM frames utilize specific paths. Thus, it MUST be possible to
   arrange that OAM frames follow the path taken by a specific flow.

   RBridges MUST have the ability to identify frames which require OAM
   processing..

   TRILL OAM frames MUST remain within a TRILL campus and MUST NOT be
   egressed from a TRILL network as native frames.

   OAM MUST have ability to include all Ethernet traffic types carried
   by TRILL.

4.2. Connectivity Verification

4.2.1. Unicast

   From an arbitrary RBridge RB1, OAM MUST have the ability to verify
   connectivity to any other RBridge RB2.

   From an arbitrary RBridge RB1, OAM MUST have the ability to verify
   connectivity to any other RBridge RB2 for a specific flow via the
   path associated with the specified flow.

4.2.2. Distribution Trees

   OAM MUST have the ability to verify connectivity, from an arbitrary
   RBridge RB1, to either a specific set of RBridges or all member
   RBridges, for a specified distribution tree. This functionality is
   referred to as verification of the un-pruned distribution tree.

   OAM MUST have the ability to verify connectivity, from an arbitrary
   RBridge RB1, to either a specific set of RBridges or all member
   RBridges, for a specified distribution tree and for a specified
   flow. This functionality is referred to as verification of the
   pruned tree.

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements             January 2013


4.3. Continuity Check

   OAM MUST provide functions that allow any arbitrary RBridge RB1 to
   perform a Continuity Check to any other RBridge.

   OAM MUST provide functions that allow any arbitrary RBridge RB1 to
   perform a Continuity Check to any other RBridge using a path
   associated with a specified flow.

   OAM SHOULD provide functions that allow any arbitrary RBridge to
   perform a Continuity Check to any other RBridge over any section of
   any selectable least cost path.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to perform a Continuity Check on
   sections of any selectable path within the network.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to perform a multicast Continuity
   Check for specified distribution tree(s) as well as specified
   distribution tree and flow combinations. The former is referred to
   as an un-pruned multi-destination tree Continuity Check and the
   latter is referred to as a pruned tree Continuity Check.

4.4. Path Tracing

   OAM MUST provide the ability to trace a path between any two
   RBridges per specified unicast flow.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to trace all selectable least cost
   paths between any two RBridges.

   OAM SHOULD provide functionality to trace all branches of a
   specified distribution tree (un-pruned tree).

   OAM SHOULD provide functionality to trace all branches of a
   specified distribution tree for a specified flow (pruned tree).

4.5. General Requirements

   OAM MUST provide the ability to initiate and maintain multiple
   concurrent sessions for multiple OAM functions between any arbitrary
   RBridge RB1 to any other RBridge. In general, multiple OAM
   operations will run concurrently. For example, proactive continuity
   checks may take place between RB1 and RB2 at the same time an
   operator decides to test connectivity between the same two RBs.
   Multiple OAM functions and instances of those functions MUST be able
   to run concurrently without interfering with each other.

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements             January 2013


   OAM MUST provide a single OAM framework for all TRILL OAM functions
   within the scope of this document.

   OAM, as practical and as possible, SHOULD reuse functional,
   operational and semantic elements of existing OAM standards.

   OAM MUST maintain related error and operational counters. Such
   counters MUST be accessible via network management applications
   (e.g. SNMP).

   OAM functions related to continuity and connectivity checks MUST be
   able to be invoked either proactively or on-demand.

   OAM MAY be required to provide the ability to specify a desired
   response mode for a specific OAM message. The desired response mode
   can be either in-band, out-of band or none.

   The OAM Framework MUST be extensible to include new functionality.
   For example, the solution needs to include a Version number to
   differentiate older and newer implementations and TLV structures for
   flexibility to include new information elements.

   OAM MAY provide methods to verify control plane and forwarding plane
   alignments.

   OAM SHOULD leverage existing OAM technologies, where practical.

4.6. Performance Monitoring

4.6.1. Packet Loss

   In this document, the term loss of a packet is used as defined in
   [RFC2680] (see Section 2.4 of RFC2680).

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to measure packet loss statistics for
   a flow from any arbitrary RBridge RB1 to any other RBridge.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to measure packet loss statistics
   over a section, for a  flow between any arbitrary RBridge RB1 to any
   other RBridge.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to measure packet loss statistics
   between any two RBridges over all least cost paths.

   An RBridge SHOULD be able to perform the above packet loss
   measurement functions either proactively or on-demand.

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements             January 2013


4.6.2. Packet Delay

   There are two types of packet delays -- one-way delay and two-way
   delay (Round Trip Delay).

   One-way delay is defined in [RFC2679] as the time elapsed from the
   start of transmission of the first bit of a packet by an RBridge
   until the reception of the last bit of the packet by the destination
   RBridge.

   Two-way delay is also referred to as Round Trip Delay and is defined
   similar to [RFC2681]; i.e. the time elapsed from the start of
   transmission of the first bit of a packet from RB1, receipt of the
   packet at RB2, RB2 sending a response packet back to RB1 and RB1
   receiving the last bit of that response packet.

   OAM SHOULD provide functions to measure two-way delay between two
   RBridges.

   OAM MAY provide functions to measure one-way delay between two
   RBridges for a specified flow.

   OAM MAY provide functions to measure one-way delay between two
   RBridges for a specified flow over a specific section.



4.7. ECMP Utilization

   OAM MAY provide functionality to monitor the effectiveness of per-
   hop ECMP hashing. For example, individual RBridges could maintain
   counters that show how packets are being distributed across equal
   cost next hops for a specified destination RBridge or RBridges as a
   result of ECMP hashing.

4.8. Security and Operational considerations

   Methods MUST be provided to protect against exploitation of OAM
   framework for security and denial of service attacks.

   Methods MUST  be provided to prevent OAM messages causing congestion
   in the networks. Periodically generated messages with high
   frequencies may lead to congestion, hence methods such as shaping or
   rate limiting SHOULD be utilized.

   Certain OAM functions may be utilized to gather operational
   information such as topology of the network. Methods MUST be

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements             January 2013


   provided to prevent unauthorized users accessing OAM functions to
   gather critical and sensitive information of the network.

   OAM packets MUST be limited to within the TRILL campus and
   implementation MUST provide methods to prevent leaking of OAM
   packets out of the TRILL campus. Additionally methods MUST be
   provided to prevent accepting OAM packets from outside the TRILL
   campus.

4.9. Fault Indications

   OAM MUST provide a Fault Indication framework to notify faults to
   the ingress RBRidge of the packet or other interested parties (such
   as syslog servers).

   OAM MUST provide functions to selectively enable or disable
   different types of Fault Indications.

4.10. Defect Indications

   OAM SHOULD provide a framework for Defect Detection and Indication.

   OAM Defect Detection and Indication Framework SHOULD provide methods
   to selectively enable or disable Defect Detection per defect type.

   OAM Defect Detection and Indication Framework SHOULD provide methods
   to configure Defect Detection thresholds per different types of
   defects.

   OAM Defect Detection and Indication Framework SHOULD provide methods
   to log defect indications to a locally defined archive (such as log
   buffer) or SNMP traps.

   OAM Defect Detection and Indication Framework SHOULD provide a
   Remote Defect Indication framework that facilitates notifying the
   originator/owner of the flow experiencing the defect, which is the
   ingress RBridge.

   Remote Defect Indication MAY be either in-band or out-of-band.

4.11. Live Traffic monitoring

   OAM implementations MAY provide methods to utilize live traffic for
   troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
