Abstract

   This document presents the problem of authentication and
   authorization in wireless mesh networks constituted by several users
   communicating with application servers and communicating with each
   other in a single or multi-hop fashion.  Each user in this
   environment can also play the role of an application provider.

   Imagine a large music event where the provided network infrastructure
   is enhanced with network storage equipment to allow visitors to
   access content relating to the bands playing at the events, such as
   recorded video of previous performances, supplementary audio and
   video material relevant to the bands playing, etc.  Certain content
   is, however, not necessarily available to everyone under the same
   conditions.  Instead access control is applied before the full range
   of audio, and video material can be accessed.  Other content, such as
   previews, might be offered for free.  How can such authentication,
   and authorization infrastructure be made available with minimal
   configuration complexity for a temporary event like a music festival?

   This document lists the requirements for a potentially needed
   Kerberos extension and presents a solution proposal based on the
   attempt to use a Kerberos extension for mutual authentication in
   wireless mesh networks.

2.  Introduction and Problem Statement

   Authentication and authorization to services access is still an open
   problem in wireless mesh network distributed environments in which
   several users would need to communicate to several application
   servers and with each other in a single or multi-hop fashion, and
   each user could play the role of an application provider.

   The Kerberos authentication model [RFC4120] uses a symmetric
   cryptography approach, offering a high security level and allowing
   mutual authentication.  The principle of using service tickets in
   Kerberos allows for credentials distribution which is suitable for
   wireless mesh networks distributed environments.  However, the
   centralized approach in Kerberos (where each user should communicate
   with the authentication server each time he needs services
   credentials) restricts its usage for authentication in such
   distributed environments.  Furthermore, Kerberos rather authenticates
   each node with respect to the authentication server and to the

   application server.  The distributed credentials principle in
   Kerberos (through Service tickets) is promising for allowing
   authentication between each user and the application.  However, the
   authentication between each two users who communicate with each other
   is still not covered by Service tickets, especially with the dynamic
   nature of distributed environments in which users connectivity (that
   could be single or multi-hop) change frequently with time.

   Although the multi-hop communication is transparent to the
   application, there is a need to handle the authentication and access
   control among the different multi-hop communicating nodes to prevent
   against malicious actions taken by the human users themselves.  Based
   on this fact, this draft proposes to use a common key obtained by
   Kerberos for authentication among each two nodes who communicate
   together in a multi-hop fashion.  This common key is dynamic
   (renewable with time) for security reasons in such dynamic and
   distributed wireless environment that is less secure.


3.  Requirements

   This section presents a number of requirements motivated by the
   problem defined in the previous section.  These requirements are as
   follows:
   o  Distributed environment consisting of fixed and mobile nodes.
   o  Dynamic neighbors and dynamic application providers (any node
      could be an application provider at any time providing
      applications to other nodes in the network, e.g. file sharing,
      sending special announcement concerning the surrounding
      environments, and sending alarms in case of problems).
   o  User Generated Content (UGC) application, in which each node could
      be a source of content (mainly multimedia contents) for other
      nodes in the network, e.g. transmitting video snapshots during
      festival events.
   o  Hundreds of nodes (indoor or outdoor environment).
   o  Personal devices (of low power) individually used by users.
   o  Multihop communication.
   o  Authentication and access control of each user node by a trusted
      third party.
   o  Access control of each user by a trusted third party in a way that
      corresponds to the user subscription type and profile.
   o  Mutual authentication between each pair of communicating users.
   o  Limited bandwidth: need for minimizing traffic (minimizing the
      communication with the KDC).
   o  Dynamic credentials (attributing dynamic credentials to be
      distributed to each user).

4.  Kerberos Extension Solution Proposal

   This section presents a solution proposal extending the Kerberos
   authentication model for authenticating each user node in wireless
   mesh networks with respect to the network operator and with respect
   to other users nodes participating in the network.

   The Kerberos server resides in the local mesh network or in an
   external network and each user node needs to communicate firstly with
   this server in order to authenticate with respect to the operator and
   to obtain the necessary credentials (Kerberos tickets) for
   authentication with other users nodes and for accessing the offered
   services in the mesh network.  The communication can take place in a
   single hop or through multi-hops (passing by intermediate users
   nodes) according to the proximity of each user node from the
   application providers nodes.

   To prevent unreliable communication from taking place (intermediate
   nodes could do DoS, messages truncating,...), this solution proposal
   extends the classical Kerberos authentication model to adapt to the
   multi-hop communication through introducing a new shared secret for
   authentication and access control between intermediate nodes along
   the multi-hop communication.  But, if this secret is the same for all
   the time, it could be compromised and the entire network would be
   compromised.  It is then proposed in this draft to obtain several
   shared secrets during the service ticket request for the service for
   which the multihop communication is needed.

   The solution proposal takes the following sequence:
   o  Each user node wishing to access the services offered by the mesh
      network starts by sending a first request to the KDC (TGT part) in
      order to authenticate with respect to the operator and to obtain
      the TGT ticket.  The process is similar to the classical Kerberos
      authentication approach, and the user, if legitimate, obtains the
      corresponding TGT ticket.
   o  After obtaining the TGT, the user node re-contacts the KDC (TGS
      part), through sending a TGS request, in order to obtain the
      necessary credentials (including the service ticket for the
      service for which multihop communication will be employed in
      addition to the shared secrets for authentication during the
      multihop communication) while presenting the obtained TGT ticket
      as a proof of authenticity.  The classical Kerberos TGS request
      should be extended to illustrate the need of extra credentials for
      authentication with intermediate nodes along the multi-hop
      communication.  The following figure illustrates this extension,
      where a new flag is defined in the flags field in the reserved
      bits between bits 12 and 25 taking the value 1 to indicate the
      case of Kerberos in the multi-hop mode.

                          Figure 1: Extended TGS-REQ

   o  Once the KDC (TGS part), receiving the TGS request from the user,
      verifies the TGT ticket and the user authenticity, it sends to the
      user the Kerberos TGS reply message extended to contain the
      necessary credentials according to the user profile and according
      to the required service.
   o  The extended Kerberos TGS reply message includes the service
      ticket for the service for which the multihop wommunication will
      be employed as well as the shared secrets.
   o  To avoid the shared secret compromise, several shared secrets are
      obtained, where each shared secret is valid for a given time
      interval.  However, the shared secret distributions should be done
      in a mean that would not compromise the security of the whole
      network:
      *  If the shared secrets are required by each mesh node at each
         time interval, this would generate lot of traffic during the
         communication with the KDC.
      *  If the shared secrets for future time intervals are pre-
         generated by the KDC and given in batch to each user, this
         would optimize traffic, but if a node is compromised at an

         interval of time, all the shared secrets would be known and the
         network would be compromised.
   o  Then, the KDC sends to each mesh node in the extended TGS reply
      message the current interval shared secret and the pre-generated
      ones for the future, while each pre-generated shared secret is
      encrypted with a key corresponding to the its related time
      interval.  This encryption key should be sent to each mesh node in
      the corresponding time interval either through Kerberos protocol
      or through a multicast routing protocol.  The following figure
      illustrates the extended TGS reply message.  In this extended
      message: i) a new flag is defined in the flags field in the
      reserved bits between bits 14 and 31 taking the value 1 to
      indicate the case of Kerberos in the multi-hop mode. ii) a new
      field authorized-data is added which is identical to the
      authorization data field existing in the service ticket and
      containing elements, where the first element contains the current
      time interval in its (type) part and the corresponding shared key
      to this interval in its (data part).  The other elements contains
      the upcoming time intervals and the corresponding shared keys in
      an encrypted form as explained above.

   o  Group keys can be also considered allowing to have a shared secret
      for each group of mesh nodes and allowing each mesh node to
      participate to more than one group and hence to have several group
      keys.  If one group key is compromised it could be deleted by the
      KDC.  Mesh nodes sharing the same group key are mesh nodes sharing
      some common characteristics (making a cluster, hierarchal group
      keys for example, ...).


5.  Potential Use-cases

   This section presents the potential use-cases for distributed
   environments of wireless mesh networks having multi-hop communication
   and requiring distributed authentication authorization.
   o  Temporary network infrastructure deployment for special events
      (sport events, music festivals, ..).  Network operators deploy
      temporary low-cost infrastructure for temporary events and hence
      counts on the communication of users with application servers that
      are locally deployed.  Also the users themselves can play the role
      of application providers contributing to the diffusion of
      multimedia services (video snapshots on the event,video streams
      with inserted comments, video streaming for what was missed in the
      event, downloading an interactive audio-visual program for the
      event,. ..).  In such use-case, there is a need for dynamic
      credentials distribution on the different participating nodes and
      there is also a need of controlling the access of each user to the
      authorized service for a duration corresponding to his
      subscription.
   o  Community networks, where a user owns the home gateway to the
      Internet and allows other distributed users to have access to the
      Internet through passing by his home gateway.  Users may need to
      pass by other users (in the community network) in order to reach
      the home gateway.  In this use-case, there is a need for
      credentials distribution in a dynamic manner (adapting to the
      random configuration of the community network) to allow mutual
      authentication between each pair of communicating users and
      between each user and the home gateway providing the Internet
      access.
