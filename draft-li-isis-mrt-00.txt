   Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Extensions for
                    Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT)

Abstract

   This document describes necessary extensions to IS-IS to support the
   distributed computation of Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT).  Some
   example uses of the MRTs include IP/LDP Fast-Reroute and global
   protection or live-live for multicast traffic.  The extensions
   indicate what MRT profile(s) each router supports.  Different MRT
   profiles can be defined to support different uses and to allow
   transition of capabilities.  An extension is introduced to flood MRT-
   Ineligible links, due to administrative policy.

1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS protocol is specified in [ISO10589], with extensions for
   supporting IPv4 and IPv6 specified in [RFC1195] and [RFC5308].  Each
   Intermediate System (IS) (router) advertises one or more IS-IS Link
   State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) with routing information.  Each LSP
   is composed of a fixed header and a number of tuples, each consisting
   of a Type, a Length, and a Value.  Such tuples are commonly known as
   TLVs, and are a good way of encoding information in a flexible and
   extensible format.

Internet-Draft          IS-IS Extensions for MRT            October 2013


   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] gives a complete solution for
   IP/LDP fast-reroute using Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT) to provide
   alternates.  This document describes the necessary signaling
   extensions for supporting MRT-FRR used in IS-IS routing domain.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   Redundant Trees (RT): A pair of trees where the path from any node X
   to the root R along the first tree is node-disjoint with the path
   from the same node X to the root R along the second tree.  These can
   be computed in 2-connected graphs.

   Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT): A pair of trees where the path from
   any node X to the root R along the first tree and the path from the
   same node X to the root R along the second tree share the minimum
   number of nodes and the minimum number of links.  Each such shared
   node is a cut-vertex.  Any shared links are cut-links.  Any RT is an
   MRT but many MRTs are not RTs.

   MRT Island: From the computing router, the set of routers that
   support a particular MRT profile and are connected via MRT- eligible
   links.

   GADAG: Generalized Almost Directed Acyclic Graph - a graph which is
   the combination of the ADAGs of all blocks.  Transforming a network
   graph into a GADAG is part of the MRT algorithm.

   MRT-Red: MRT-Red is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is used
   to describe the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
   Specifically, MRT-Red is the decreasing MRT where links in the GADAG
   are taken in the direction from a higher topologically ordered node
   to a lower one.

   MRT-Blue: MRT-Blue is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
   used to describe the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
   Specifically, MRT-Blue is the increasing MRT where links in the GADAG
   are taken in the direction from a lower topologically ordered node to
   a higher one.

Internet-Draft          IS-IS Extensions for MRT            October 2013


   As stated in [I-D.enyedi-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm], it is necessary
   for each MRT-Capable router to compute MRT next hops in a consistent
   fashion.  This is achieved by using same MRT profile and selecting
   the unique root in an MRT Island which is connected by MRT-Eligible
   links.  Each of these issues will be discussed in following sections
   separately.

4.1.  Supporting MRT Profiles

   The contents and requirements of an MRT profile has been defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  The parameters and behavioral
   rules contained in an MRT profile define one router's MRT
   capabilities.  Based on common capabilities, one unified MRT Island
   is built.

   The MRT-Capable router MUST advertise its corresponding MRT profiles
   by IS-IS protocol extension within IS-IS routing domain.  The
   capabilities of advertiser MUST conform to the profile it claimed
   completely, especially the MT-IDs, the algorithm and the
   corresponding forwarding mechanism.  This advertisement MUST have
   level scope.  One router MAY support multiple MRT profiles and it
   MUST advertise these profiles in corresponding IS-IS level.  The MT-
   IDs used in one supported MRT Profile MUST NOT overlap with those MT-
   IDs used in a different supported MRT Profile.

   The default MRT Profile is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  Its behavior is intended to
   support IP/LDP unicast and multicast Fast-Reroute.  MRT-Capable
   routers SHOULD support the default MRT profile.

4.2.  Electing GADAG Root

   As per [I-D.enyedi-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm], a GADAG root MUST be
   selected for one MRT Island.  An unique GADAG root in common-sense
   among MRT Island routers is a necessity to do MRT computation.  Since
   the selection of the GADAG root can affect the alternates and the
   traffic through it, the selection rules give network operator a knob
   to control the alternates and the traffic inside the MRT Island.
   Relevant discussion for the relationship between GADAG root role and
   MRT Island alternates is out of the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft          IS-IS Extensions for MRT            October 2013


   Each MRT-Capable router MUST advertise its priority for GADAG root
   selection.  One router can only have one priority in the same MRT
   Island.  It can have multiple priorities for different MRT Islands it
   supports.  Routers that are marked as overloaded([RFC3787]) are not
   qualified as candidate for root selection.  A GADAG root is selected
   by comparing their priorities.  The router with the highest priority
   among those available candidates is the GADAG root with higher system
   ID as the tie-breaker if priorities are same.

   When the current root is out of service or new router with higher
   priority joined into the MRT Island, the GADAG root MUST be re-
   selected.  A new MRT computation will be triggered because of such a
   topology change.

4.3.  Advertising MRT-Ineligible Links for MRT

   For certain administrative or management reason, some links may not
   be involved into MRT computation.  In this scenario, MRT-Capable
   router MUST claim those MRT-Ineligible links are out of MRT Island
   scope.  If such claim splits current MRT Island then MRT computation
   has to be done inside the modified MRT Island which the computing
   router belongs to.

4.4.  Triggering an MRT Computation

   An MRT Computation can be triggered through topology changes or MRT
   capability changes of any router in the MRT Island.  It is always
   triggered for a given MRT Profile in the corresponding level.  First,
   the associated MRT Island is determined.  Then, the GADAG Root is
   selected.  Finally, the actual MRT algorithm is run to compute the
   transit MRT-Red and MRT-Blue topologies.  Additionally, the router
   MAY choose to compute MRT-FRR alternates or make other use of the MRT
   computation results.

   Prefixes can be attached and detached and have their associated MRT-
   Red and MRT-Blue next-hops computed without requiring a new MRT
   computation.

5.  MRT Capability Advertisement

   MRT-Capable router MUST identify its MRT capabilities through IS-IS
   Link State Packet(LSP) in level scope.

Internet-Draft          IS-IS Extensions for MRT            October 2013


5.1.  Advertising MRT Capability in IS-IS LSP

   One new M-bit is introduced into TLV 229 to identify router is MRT-
   Capable.  Structure of TLV 229 is stated in [RFC5120] as pictured
   below:

   TYPE: 229

   LENGTH: total length of the value field, it SHOULD be 2 times the
   number of MT components.

   VALUE: one or more 2-byte MT components, structured as follows:

                                                 No. of Octets
             +--------------------------------+
             |O |A |M |R |        MT ID       |      2
             +--------------------------------+


   Bit M identifies the originator is of MRT-Capable.  The MRT-Blue and
   the MRT-Red alternates will be calculated for the MT identified by
   MT-ID.

   This M-bit MUST be set and checked in LSP fragment 0.  An MRT-Capable
   router MUST advertise this TLV with M-bit set for corresponding MT.
   For instance, if M-bit is set for MT-ID #0, MRT alternates will be
   calculated for standard topology.

   If only M-bit is advertised for MRT-Capabilities without any other
   MRT information then the router is regarded as supporting default MRT
   profile with default GADAG root priority.

5.2.  MRT Profile sub-TLV in IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV

   One new MRT Profile sub-TLV is introduced into IS-IS Router
   CAPABILITY TLV[RFC4971] to advertise MRT capabilities.  Since MRT is
   per level scope, the S-bit and D-bit of IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV
   MUST be set zero.  Structure of MRT Profile sub-TLV is pictured as
   below:

   TYPE: TBD

   LENGTH: 8 octets

   VALUE:

   MT ID (2 octet with 4 bits reserved)

Internet-Draft          IS-IS Extensions for MRT            October 2013


   Profile ID (1 octet)

   GADAG priority (1 octet)

                 +--------------------------------+
                 |R |R |R |R |        MT ID       |      2
                 +----------------+---------------+
                 |   Profile ID   |                      1
                 +----------------+
                 | GADAG Priority |                      1
                 +----------------+---------------+
                 |        MRT-Blue MT ID          |      2
                 +--------------------------------+
                 |        MRT-Red MT ID           |      2
                 +--------------------------------+


   12-bit MT ID represents the base MT topology which MRT computation is
   based on.  Profile ID represents the MRT profile this router supports
   and GADAG Priority is the priority for root selection.  The range of
   this priority is [0, 255] with 128 as the default value.  Higher
   numerical value means higher priority.

   Those routers which do not want to be involved into GADAG root
   selection can have priority 0.  If all routers in MRT Island carry
   the same priority then the one with the highest system ID has to be
   chosen as GADAG root.

   If the MRT-Blue MT-ID is 0, then the value specified in the
   associated MRT Profile is assumed.  If the MRT-Red MT-ID is 0, then
   the value specified in the associated MRT profile is assumed.  The
   MRT-Blue MT-ID and MRT-Red MT-ID MUST NOT be the reserved values for
   MT-ID([RFC5120]).  The value for MRT-Blue MT-ID and MRT-Red MT-ID
   MUST be different except for 0.  As stated above, the MRT-Blue MT-ID
   and MRT-Red MT-ID MUST NOT overlap among profiles if multiple MRT-
   Profile sub-TLVs are advertised.

   This sub-TLV can occur multiple times if this router support multiple
   MRT profiles.  This can happen during transition or to support
   multiple uses of MRT which prefer different profiles.

5.3.  MRT-Ineligible Links sub-TLV in IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV

   As a matter of policy, some links may not be available for the MRT
   computation, which can prevent alternates or traffic using these
   links.  For instance, policy can be made to prevent fast-rerouted
   traffic from taking those links.

Internet-Draft          IS-IS Extensions for MRT            October 2013


   For a link to be excluded from the MRT computation, it MUST be
   advertised as sub-TLV in IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV which is in
   level scope with B-bit and D-bit unset.  The MRT-Ineligible Link sub-
   TLV is structured as below:

   TYPE: TBD

   LENGTH: from 9 to 255 octets

   VALUE:

   MT ID (2 octet with 4 bits reserved)

   System ID and pseudo-node number (7 octet for each MRT-Ineligible
   Link)

                                                 No. of Octets
             +--------------------------------+
             |R |R |R |R |        MT ID       |      2
             +--------------------------------+
             |System ID and pseudonode number |      7
             +--------------------------------+
             |         Default metric         |      3
             +--------------------------------+
             .                                .
             .                                .
             +--------------------------------+
             |System ID and pseudonode number |      7
             +--------------------------------+
             |         Default metric         |      3
             +--------------------------------+


   Each MRT-Ineligible Link is identified by neighbor's System ID and
   pseudo-node number and Default metric, same as IS Reachability TLV.
   This sub-TLV MAY occur multiple times if multiple links are
   ineligible.

6.  Handling MRT Capability Sending and Receiving

   The M-bit which identifies router's MRT capability MUST be advertised
   in LSP fragment 0.  Those MRT related sub-TLVs SHOULD be ignored when
   MRT Capability bit is unset.  When changes in MRT capabilities are
   received, an MRT computation SHOULD be triggered but MAY be delayed
   for a while to allow reception of all MRT-related information.

6.1.  Advertising MRT extension

Internet-Draft          IS-IS Extensions for MRT            October 2013


   MRT sub-TLVs are encapsulated in the Router Capability TLV and
   advertised through LSP PDU for the level-wide.  MRT sub-TLVs are
   optional.  If one router does not support MRT, it MUST NOT advertise
   those sub-TLVs.

   Since the advertisement scope of the MRT sub-TLV is level-wide, the
   D-Bit and S-Bit of the Router Capability TLV MUST be set as 0 when it
   is advertised.  If other sub-TLVs in the Router Capability TLV need
   different values for those two bits, there MUST be an independent
   Router Capability TLV for MRT sub-TLVs.

   When MRT related information is changed for the router or existing
   IS-IS LSP mechanisms are triggered for refreshing or updating, MRT
   sub-TLVs MUST be advertised if the router is MRT-Capable.

   For administrative policies or reasons, certain links can not be
   involved into MRT Computation.  MRT-Ineligible sub-TLV is used to
   advertise these links among MRT Island.

6.2.  Parsing MRT extension

   MRT extension MUST NOT affect the peer setup and the routing
   calculation of the standard topology.

   MRT sub-TLVs SHOULD be validated like other sub-TLVs when received.
   MRT sub-TLVs SHOULD also be taken for the checksum calculation and
   authentication.

   If MT-ID conflict is found for MRT-Red or MRT-blue from multiple sub-
   TLVs then those associated sub-TLVs MUST be ignored.

   Links advertised in MRT-Ineligible sub-TLV MUST be precluded from MRT
   Computation.  The removal of those links may change the computing
   router's MRT Island significantly.

7.  Backwards Compatibility

   The M-bit for MRT capability, the MRT Profile sub-TLV and the MRT-
   Ineligible Link sub-TLV defined in this document SHOULD NOT introduce
   any interoperability issues.  Routers that do not support these MRT
   extensions SHOULD silently ignore them.  Alternates or traffic MUST
   NOT be affected in current IS-IS routing domain.
