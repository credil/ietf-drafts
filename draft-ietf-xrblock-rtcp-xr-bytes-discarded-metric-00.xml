      <t>
      The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-
      time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term and
      long-term reception statistics. The available reporting may include
      aggregate information across longer periods of time as well as
      individual packet reporting. This document specifies a report computing
      the bytes discarded from the de-jitter buffer after successful
      reception.

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      <xref target="RFC3550">RTP</xref> provides a transport for real-time
      media flows such as audio and video together with the RTP control
      protocol (RTCP) which provides periodic feedback about the media streams
      received in a specific duration. In addition, RTCP can be used for
      timely feedback about individual events to report (e.g., packet loss)
      <xref target="RFC4585"/>. Both long-term and short-term feedback enable
      a media sender to adapt its media transmission and/or encoding 
      dynamically to the observed path characteristics.
    </t>

    <t>
      <xref target="RFC3611">RFC3611</xref> defines RTCP Extended Reports as a
      detailed reporting framework to provide more than just the coarse
      Receiver Report (RR) statistics. The detailed reporting may enable a
      media sender to react more appropriately to the observed networking
      conditions as these can be characterized better, although at the expense
      of extra overhead.
    </t>
    <t>
      In addition to lost packets, RFC3611 defines the notion of "discarded"
      packets: packets that were received but dropped from the de-jitter
      buffer because they were either too early (for buffering) or too late
      (for playout). The "discard rate" metric is part of the VoIP metrics
      report block even though it is not just applicable to audio: it is
      specified as the fraction of discarded packets since the beginning of
      the session. See section 4.7.1 of <xref target="RFC3611">RFC3611</xref>.
      The discard metric is believed to be applicable to a large class of RTP
      applications which use a de-jitter buffer <xref
      target="RFC5481">RFC5481</xref>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Recently proposed extensions to the Extended Reports (XR) reporting
      suggest enhancing this discard metric:
      <list style="symbols">
    <t>
      Reporting the number of discarded packets in a measurement interval,
      i.e., during either the last reporting interval or since the beginning
      of the session, as indicated by a flag in the suggested XR report <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard"/>. If an endpoint needs to
      report packet discard due to other reasons than early- and late-arrival
      (for example, discard due to duplication, redundancy, etc.) then it
      should consider using the Discarded Packets Report Block <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Reporting gaps and bursts of discarded packets during a measurement
      interval, i.e., the last reporting interval or the duration of the
      session <xref target="I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-burst-gap-discard"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Reporting run-length encoding of discarded packet during a measurement
      interval, i.e., between a set of sequence numbers  <xref 
      target="I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard-rle-metrics"/>.
    </t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>
      However, none of these metrics allow a receiver to report precisely the
      number of bytes that were discarded. While this information could in
      theory be derived from high-frequency reporting on the number of
      discarded packets <xref target="I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard"/> or
      from the Discard RLE report <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard-rle-metrics"/>, these two
      mechanisms do not appear feasible: The former would require an unduly
      high amount of reporting which still might not be sufficient due to the
      non-deterministic scheduling of RTCP packets. The latter incurs
      significant complexity (by storing a map of sequence numbers and packet
      sizes) and reporting overhead.
    </t>
    <t>
      An XR block is defined in this document to indicate the number of bytes
      discarded, per interval or for the duration of the session, similar to
      other XR report blocks.
     </t>
<!--    <t>
      Alternatively, if the sender keeps a history of the size of the packets reported 
      in the measurement interval then the sender can calculate the number of 
      bytes discarded from the information in the discard RLE block.

    Block Type (BT, 8 bits): A Bytes Discarded Packets Report Block is
    identified by the constant BDR.

  <t>
    The Interval Metric flag (I) (2 bits) is used to indicate whether the
    discard metric is Interval, or a Cumulative metric, that is, whether the
    reported value applies to the most recent measurement interval duration
    between successive reports (I=10, the Interval Duration) or to the
    accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements (I=11, the
    Cumulative Duration). Since the bytes discarded are not measured at a
    particular time instance but over one or several reporting intervals, the
    metric MUST NOT be reported as a Sampled Metric (I=01). In addition, the
    value I=00 is reserved and MUST NOT be sent, and MUST be discarded
    when received.
  </t>
<!--[Changed because I bit in MONARCH is 2 bits ]
Numerical values for sampled duration are provided in the
Measurement Identifier block referenced by the tag field below.

      The Interval Metric flag (I) (1 bit) is used to indicate whether the
      Post-Repair Loss metric is an Interval or a Cumulative metric, that is, 
      whether the reported value applies to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).
      Numerical values for both these intervals are provided in the
      Measurement Identifier block referenced by the tag field below.
      
      
<t>
    Measurement Identifier association (Tag) 3 bits:

    This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
    which describes the sampled measurement. The tag in the corresponding 
    Measurement Identifier block has the same tag value. Note that there 
    may be more than one Measurement Identifier block per RTCP packet.
    The tag MUST be set to 0 when using cumulative or interval durations.
</t>

      
      -->
  <t>
    The 'E' bit is introduced to distinguish between packets discarded due to
    early arrival and those discarded due to late arrival. The 'E' bit is
    set to '1' if it reports bytes discarded due to early arrival and is
    set to '0' if it reports bytes discarded due to late arrival. If a 
    duplicate packet is received and discarded, these duplicate packets are
    ignored and not reported. In case both early and late discarded packets
    shall be reported, two Bytes Discarded report blocks MUST be included.
  </t>
  <t>
    <!-- These reserved bits (5 bits) MUST be set to zero by media receivers
    and MUST be ignored by media senders. -->
    reserved (5 bits): This field is reserved for future definition. In the
    absence of such definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
    MUST be ignored by the receiver.
  </t>
  <t>
    block length (16 bits) MUST be set to 2, in accordance with the definition
    of this field in <xref target="RFC3611" />. The block MUST be discarded if
    the block length is set to a different value.
  </t>
  <t>
    The 'number of bytes discarded' is a 32-bit unsigned integer value
    indicating the total number of bytes discarded. Bytes discarded
    corresponds to the RTP payload size of every RTP packet that is discarded
    (due to early or late arrival). Hence, the bytes discarded ignores the
    size of any RTP header extensions and the size of the padding bits. Also 
    the discarded packet is associated to the interval in which it was
    discarded and not when it was expected.
  </t>
  <t>
    If Interval Metric flag (I=11) is set, the value in the field indicates
    the number of bytes discarded from the start of the session, if Interval
    Metric flag (I=01) is set, it indicates the number of bytes discarded
    since the last RTCP XR Byte Discarded Block was received. 
  </t>
  <t>
    If the XR block follows a measurement identity block <xref
    target="RFC6776"/> in the same RTCP
    compound packet then the cumulative (I=11) or the interval (I=10) for this
    report block corresponds to the values of the "measurement duration" in
    the measurement information block.
  </t>
  <t>
    <!-- Bytes Discarded Report Blocks SHOULD be sent in conjunction with an
    RTCP RR as a compound RTCP packet. -->
    If the receiver sends the Bytes Discarded Report Block without the
    measurement identity block then the discard block MUST be sent in
    conjunction with an RTCP Receiver Report (RR) as a compound RTCP packet.
  </t>
<!--  <t>
    Editor's note: is it acceptable to use one of the 'reserved' bits for this
    purpose or should two block types be used?

<section title="Protocol Operation" anchor="protocol">
  <t>
    This section describes the behavior of the reporting node (= media 
    receiver) and the media sender.
  </t>
  <section title="Reporting Node (Receiver)">
    <t>
      Transmission of RTCP XR Bytes Discarded Report is up to the discretion
      of the media receiver, as is the reporting granularity.  However, it is
      RECOMMENDED that the media receiver signals all discarded packets using
      the method defined in this document.  If all packets over a reporting
      period were discarded, the media receiver MAY use the Discard Report
      Block <xref target="I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard"/> instead. 
    </t>
    <t>
      The media receiver MAY send the Bytes Discard Reports as part of the
      regularly scheduled RTCP packets as per RFC3550. It MAY also include
      Bytes Discard Reports in immediate or early feedback packets as per
      RFC4585.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Media Sender">
    <t>
      The media sender MUST be prepared to operate without receiving any Bytes
      Discarded reports. If Bytes Discarded reports are generated by the media
      receiver, the media sender cannot rely on all these reports being
      received, nor can the media sender rely on a regular generation pattern
      from the media receiver.
    </t>
    <t>
      However, if the media sender receives any RTCP reports but no Bytes
      Discard report blocks and is aware that the media receiver supports
      Bytes Discard report blocks, it MAY assume that no packets were
      discarded at the media receiver.
    </t>
    <t>
     The media sender SHOULD accept the Bytes Discarded Report Block only if 
     it is received in a compound RTCP receiver report or if it is preceded by 
     a measurement identity block <xref target="RFC6776"/>. Under all other 
     circumstances it MUST ignore the block.
    </t>

<section title="SDP signaling" anchor="sdp">
<!--  <t>
    The report blocks specified in this document define extensions to RTCP XR
    reporting. Whether or not this specific extended report is sent is left to
    the discretion of the receiver. Its presence may enable better operation
    of the sender since more detailed information is available. Not providing
    this information will make the sender rely on other RTCP reports.
  </t> -->
  <t>
    A participant of a media session MAY use SDP to signal its support for the
    report block specified in this document or use them without any prior
    signaling (see section 5 of <xref target="RFC3611" />).
  </t>
  <t>
    For signaling in SDP, the RTCP XR attribute as defined in <xref
    target="RFC3611" /> MUST be used. The SDP <xref target="RFC4566" />
    attribute 'xr-format' defined in RFC3611 is augmented as described in the
    following to indicate the bytes discarded metric.

  <t>
    When SDP is used in Offer/Answer context, the mechanism defined in <xref
    target="RFC3611" /> for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters applies
    (see section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC3611" />).
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
  <t>
    The Bytes Discarded block does not provide per-packet statistics, hence
    the risk to confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of <xref
    target="RFC3611" /> does not apply. In some situations, returning very
    detailed error information (e.g., over-range measurement or measurement
    unavailable) using this report block can provide an attacker with insight
    into the security processing. Implementers should consider the guidance in
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-avt-srtp-not-mandatory" /> for using appropriate
    security mechanisms, i.e., where security is a concern, the implementation
    should apply encryption and authentication to the report block. For
    example this can be achieved by using the AVPF profile together with the
    Secure RTP profile as defined in <xref target="RFC3711" />; an appropriate
    combination of the two profiles (an "SAVPF") is specified in <xref
    target="RFC5124" />. However, other mechanisms also exist (documented in
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options" />) and might be more
    suitable.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    Additionally, The security considerations of <xref target="RFC3550" />,
    <xref target="RFC3611" />, and <xref target="RFC4585" /> apply.
    <!-- Since this document offers only a more precise reporting for an
    already existing metric, no further security implications are foreseen.
