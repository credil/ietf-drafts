Internet-Draft     DHC Options for Network Management         March 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv4
   [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315]) options providing lists of IP
   addresses that can be used to locate network management services.
   The Dynamic Host Configuration (DHC) options defined in this memo
   address some gaps identified for the automated configuration of large
   IP networks [I-D.ietf-opsawg-automated-network-configuration].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  DHC Options for SYSLOG

   The SYSLOG protocol [RFC5424] supports several transport mappings.
   According to RFC 5424, implementations MUST support the TLS/TCP-based
   transport defined in [RFC5425] and they SHOULD also support the UDP-
   based transport defined in [RFC5426] for compatibility with
   traditional SYSLOG.  An optional transport of SYSLOG messages over
   DTLS/DCCP and DTLS/UDP is defined in [RFC6012].

   The DHC options described below provide a list of IPv4 or IPv6
   addresses of SYSLOG collectors in order of preference.  The client
   SHOULD use the addresses sequentially but may be configured to try
   secure and/or congestion aware transports before falling back to
   transports that are not congestion aware or insecure.  As such, the
   client may prefer to select an address providing a secure congestion
   aware transport even if it is listed with lower preference.

2.1.  SYSLOG Collector Address Option for DHCPv4

   This section describes the SYSLOG IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4.
   The SYSLOG IPv4 Address Option begins with an option code followed by
   a length octet.  The value of the length octet does not include
   itself or the option code.  The option layout is depicted below:

    Code   Len      IPv4 Address 1               IPv4 Address 2
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   | TBD1|  n  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  a1 |  a2 |  ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

   The code for the SYSLOG DHCPv4 option is [IANA: TBD1].  The minimum
   length of the option is 4 octets, and the length MUST always be a
   multiple of 4.

   The option MUST NOT be specified by the DHCPv4 client, as it is

   intended only to be returned from the DHCPv4 server.  If the DHCPv4
   client wants to receive this information from the server, it needs to
   include the number [IANA: TBD1] in the "DHCP Parameter Request List"
   option (55).

   Server addresses SHOULD be listed in order of preference, and the
   client SHOULD use the addresses sequentially but may be configured to
   use addresses in a different order according to some local policy
   (e.g., the client prefers secure and/or congestion aware transports
   as described above).

2.2.  SYSLOG Collector Address Option for DHCPv6

   This section describes the SYSLOG IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6.
   The SYSLOG IPv6 Address Option begins with an option-code followed by
   the option-len.  The value of the option-len does not include itself
   or the option-code.  The option layout is depicted below:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |        option-code            |           option-len          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   |                                                               |
                  IPv6 address of SYSLOG collector                 |
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   :                              ...                              :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The option-code of the SYSLOG DHCPv6 option OPTION_SYSLOG_COLLECTOR
   is [IANA: TBD2].  The minimum option-len is 16 octets, and the length
   MUST always be a multiple of 16.

   The option MUST NOT appear in other than the following messages:
   Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and
   Reply.  The option number for these options MAY appear in the Option
   Request Option (6) in the following messages: Solicit, Request,
   Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and Reconfigure.

   The addresses SHOULD be listed in order of preference, and the client
   SHOULD use the addresses sequentially but may be configured to use
   addresses in a different order according to some local policy (e.g.,
   the client prefers secure and/or congestion aware transports as
   described above).

Internet-Draft     DHC Options for Network Management         March 2012


3.  DHC Options for SNMP

   The SNMP protocol [RFC3410] supports several transport mappings.  The
   preferred IP-based transport is SNMP over UDP [RFC3417].  An
   experimental transport of SNMP over TCP is defined in [RFC3430].  An
   optional standards-track transport of SNMP over SSH is defined in
   [RFC5592] while optional standards-track transports over TLS and DTLS
   are defined in [RFC6353]

   The DHC options described below provide a list of IPv4 or IPv6
   addresses of SNMP entities hosting Notification Receiver applications
   in order of preference.  The client SHOULD use the addresses
   sequentially but may be configured to try secure and/or congestion
   aware transports before falling back to transports that are not
   congestion aware or insecure.  As such, the client may prefer to
   select an address providing a secure congestion aware transport even
   if it is listed with lower preference.

3.1.  SNMP Notification Receiver Address Option for DHCPv4

   This section describes the SNMP IPv4 Address Option for DHCPv4.  The
   SNMP IPv4 Address Option begins with an option code followed by a
   length octet.  The value of the length octet does not include itself
   or the option code.  The option layout is depicted below:

    Code   Len      IPv4 Address 1               IPv4 Address 2
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
   | TBD3|  n  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  a1 |  a2 |  ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

   The code for the SNMP notification receiver DHCPv4 option is [IANA:
   TBD3].  The minimum length of the option is 4 octets, and the length
   MUST always be a multiple of 4.

   The option MUST NOT be specified by the DHCPv4 client, as it is
   intended only to be returned from the DHCPv4 server.  If the DHCPv4
   client wants to receive this information from the server, it needs to
   include the number [IANA: TBD3] in the "DHCP Parameter Request List"
   option (55).

   The addresses SHOULD be listed in order of preference, and the client
   SHOULD use the addresses sequentially but may be configured to use
   addresses in a different order according to some local policy (e.g.,
   the client prefers secure and/or congestion aware transports as
   described above).

3.2.  SNMP Notification Receiver Address Option for DHCPv6

   This section describes the SNMP IPv6 Address Option for DHCPv6.  The
   SNMP IPv6 Address Option begins with an option-code followed by the
   option-len.  The value of the option-len does not include itself or
   the option-code.  The option layout is depicted below:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |        option-code            |           option-len          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   |                                                               |
   |           IPv6 address of SNMP notification receiver          |
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   :                              ...                              :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The option-code of the SNMP notification receiver DHCPv6 option
   OPTION_SNMP_NOT_RECEIVER is [IANA: TBD4].  The minimum option-len is
   16 octets, and the length MUST always be a multiple of 16.

   The option MUST NOT appear in other than the following messages:
   Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and
   Reply.  The option number for these options MAY appear in the Option
   Request Option (6) in the following messages: Solicit, Request,
   Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and Reconfigure.

   Server addresses SHOULD be listed in order of preference, and the
   client SHOULD use the addresses sequentially but may be configured to
   use addresses in a different order according to some local policy
   (e.g., the client prefers secure and/or congestion aware transports
   as described above).


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131] and [RFC3315]) apply.  If an
   adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCPv4 or DHCPv6
   server or insert its own response, a node could be led to contact a
   rogue network management server.

   It is recommended to use the DHCPv4 authentication option described
   in [RFC3118] where available.  This will also protect against denial-
   of-service attacks to DHCP servers.  [RFC3118] provides mechanisms
   for both entity authentication and message authentication.

Internet-Draft     DHC Options for Network Management         March 2012


   In IPv6 networks using DHCPv6, it is recommended that clients use
   authentication of DHCPv6 messages as described in Section 21 of
   [RFC3315].

   In deployments where DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 authentication is not
   available, lower-layer security services may be sufficient to protect
   DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign [IANA: TBD1] as an option code from the
   "DHCP Option Codes" registry.

   IANA is requested to assign [IANA: TBD2] as an option code from the
   "DHCPv6 Options Codes" registry for OPTION_SYSLOG_COLLECTOR.

   IANA is requested to assign [IANA: TBD3] as an option code from the
   "DHCP Option Codes" registry.

   IANA is requested to assign [IANA: TBD4] as an option code from the
   "DHCPv6 Options Codes" registry for OPTION_SNMP_NOT_RECEIVER.

Appendix A.  Relationship to the SNMP Configuration MIB Modules

   The SNMP notification receiver address DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options
   defined in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 provide the basic information
   to setup a target in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB and the SNMP-NOTIFICATION-
   MIB [RFC3413].  After selecting the transport (e.g., by probing the
   availability of possible SNMP transport endpoints according to some
   local policy, a volatile entry in the snmpTargetTable can be created
   as follows (assuming xyz is some suitable unique handle for the
   received DHCP option):

   snmpTargetAddrName            = "dhcp-xyz"         (INDEX)
   snmpTargetAddrTDomain         = snmpUDPDomain
   snmpTargetAddrTAddress        = "a.b.c.d"
   snmpTargetAddrTimeout         = 1500               (DEFVAL)
   snmpTargetAddrRetryCount      = 3                  (DEFVAL)
   snmpTargetAddrTagList         = "dhcp-xyz-tag"
   snmpTargetAddrParams          = "dhcp-xyz-param"
   snmpTargetAddrStorageType     = volatile(2)
   snmpTargetAddrRowStatus       = active(1)

   A matching volatile entry in the snmpNotifyTable can also be easily
   created:

   snmpNotifyName                = "dhcp-xyz"         (INDEX)
   snmpNotifyTag                 = "dhcp-xyz-tag"
   snmpNotifyType                = trap(1)            (DEFVAL)
   snmpNotifyStorageType         = volatile(2)
   snmpNotifyRowStatus           = active(1)

   In addition, an entry in the snmpTargetParamsTable is needed.  Its
   structure for SNMPv3/USM user "joe" is as follows:

   snmpTargetParamsName          = "dhcp-xyz-param"   (INDEX)
   snmpTargetParamsMPModel       = 3                  (SNMPv3)
   snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel = 3                  (USM)
   snmpTargetParamsSecurityName  = "joe"
   snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel = authNoPriv(2)
   snmpTargetParamsStorageType   = volatile(2)
   snmpTargetParamsRowStatus     = active(1)

   Creating of a suitable entry in the snmpTargetParamsTable requires
   local information.  Depending on the security model, additional
   information will be necessary.

   The creation of a suitable snmpTargetParamsTable entry may either be
   dynamic (i.e., the entry is created upon receipt of a DHC lease using
   some local policy information and deleted when the DHC lease expires)

   or suitable snmpTargetParamsTable entries may be pre-provisioned
   based on the expected naming of the target entries that are created
   dynamically.  Implementations may also pre-provision
   snmpTargetAddrTable entries and only dynamically create suitable
   snmpNotifyTable entries.
