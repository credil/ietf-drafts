                    Bootstrapping Trust on a Homenet
             draft-behringer-homenet-trust-bootstrap-01.txt

Abstract

   A homenet must be aware of its borders, and the realms within those.
   This document proposes an approach to bootstrap trust in such an
   environment.  The idea is to select one device as the trust anchor
   and to enrol other devices into the domain.  The result is the
   creation of a domain of trust in the homenet, with a common trust
   anchor.  This trust model can subsequently be used to determine
   boundaries, and to autonomically bootstrap network services.

1.  Problem Statement

   [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch] states that "A homenet will most likely also
   have internal borders between internal realms, e.g. a guest realm or
   a corporate network extension realm.  It should be possible to
   automatically discover these borders."  Simple approaches, such as
   terminating a homenet on a particular interface type do not easily
   allow for devices from different administrative realms to be locally
   connected.  [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch] states further that "It is
   important that self-configuration with 'unintended' devices is
   avoided.  There should be a way for a user to administratively assert
   in a simple way whether or not a device belongs to a homenet."

   An approach is needed that allows to establish trust inside a homenet
   according to a policy set by the user of the homenet.

2.  Approach

   This approach is based on making homenet devices behave in autonomic
   mode where devices discover each others and autonomically establish
   trust boundaries.  See [I-D.behringer-autonomic-network-framework]
   for more information.

Internet-Draft      Bootstrapping Trust on a Homenet        October 2013


2.1.  Summary of the approach

   In short, the approach is:

   o  The user pairs a smart phone (or similar device) with one of the
      devices in the homenet, for example the CPE.  The smart phone acts
      as a user interface only.

   o  The selected device becomes the trust anchor of the homenet.
      Technically, it acts as a certification authority (CA).

   o  Devices in the homenet use a protocol to exchange identities.

   o  A new device is added to the homenet by the user accepting it on
      the smart phone, and the CA issuing a domain certificate to the
      new device.

   o  The boundary of the network is determined by checking the
      certificates of devices.

2.2.  Autonomic devices

   An autonomic device can be a router, switch, PC, smartphone, or any
   other device, independent of its role in the network, which has the
   autonomic functionality mentioned below.  A homenet consists of
   autonomic devices and non-autonomic devices.  This approach requires
   at least one autonomic networking device, such as a router or switch.

2.3.  User interface

   The user interface can be provided by the devices themselves or
   through a smart phone interface.  It is also possible to access the
   devices indirectly through the manufactures web site.  Options are:

   o  The user connects a PC to a physical port on network device and
      gets access to devices's user interface.

   o  The user scans a QR code on the device using his smartphone.  This
      will trigger the download of the manufactures autonomic app which
      will allow the user to connect to the device using wireless
      access.

2.4.  The Registrar

Internet-Draft      Bootstrapping Trust on a Homenet        October 2013


   One autonomic device in the homenet takes on a registrar function.
   This could be enabled using the smartphone autonomic app; in the
   absence of a registrar function, a device can also auto-select itself
   to take on this function, using some detection mechanism to resolve
   potential conflicts.

   The registrar creates a trust anchor for the homenet domain, and
   subsequently acts as a certification authority, granting domain
   certificates to other devices.

   The user can configure a device as the registrar using one of the
   following options:

   o  By using a smartphone app which is automatically downloaded when
      scanning a QR code on the device.  This will then allow the user
      to connect to the device on an SSID which is dynamically created
      based on the device serial number.  The device will only allow
      connections from smartphones using the manufactures app.

   o  By connecting a PC to a physical port on the network device and
      gaining access to devices's user interface.

2.5.  Validating a device identity

   Every autonomic device discovers neighbouring autonomic nodes through
   an autonomic secure neighbour discovery protocol.  This could be
   implemented for example through IPv6 secure neighbour discovery,
   using a to-be-assigned well-known multicast address indicating "all
   autonomic nodes on this subnet".

   An autonomic device signs its neighbour discovery packets.  If it has
   a domain certificate from the domain registrar, it uses that.  If
   not, it uses either a vendor certificate (e.g., an IEEE 802.1AR
   [IDevID] credential) or a self-signed certificate.

   If two autonomic homenet devices use the same trust anchor they can
   verify each other's certificate thus establishing that the peer is a
   member of the same local domain.

   If one autonomic homenet device is member of the homenet domain, and
   its neighbour is not, it invites the neighbour to join the domain.
   The device without domain credentials requests to join the first
   domain it is presented with.  The device MUST only join a homenet
   domain when it is in the factory default configuration (e.g. it is
   not currently a member of a homenet).  The domain device proxies the
   request to the registrar, including the device credentials of the
   device without domain credentials.

   The registrar accepts or declines a request to join the domain, based
   on the credentials presented and other policy defined criteria such
   as proxy identity.  This may be validated by the user.  Any
   authorised device currently within the domain MAY provide
   supplemental criteria for help making this decision.  A smartphone
   autonomic application would be an ideal domain member to provide user
   interface functionality for the obtaining of supplemental criteria
   from users.

   The registrar can also decide to accept the device based on alternate
   criteria:

   o  Allow any device to join within a specific time period.

   o  Allow only devices with specific serial numbers to join.  These
      can either be entered manually into the registrar or by scanning a
      QR code using the manufactures autonomic app on a smartphone.

   o  If the device has a vendor certificate (e.g., an IEEE 802.1AR
      [IDevID] credential), the device can be validated using a Cloud
      service from the vendor.

   If a device is accepted into the domain, it is then invited to
   request a domain certificate through a certificate enrolment process.

   A device MAY require an invitation to be signed by the manufacturer,
   stating that it has been claimed by the user before it decides to
   join the domain.

   The result is a common trust anchor and device certificates for all
   autonomic devices in a domain.  These certificates can subsequently
   be used to determine the boundaries of the homenet, to authenticate
   other domain nodes, and to autonomically enable services on the
   homenet.

2.6.  Claiming a device

   A device can be claimed using one of the following options:

   o  Presenting a manufacturer signed "claim" over the network
      interface.

   o  Connecting to a physical port on the network device and inserting
      the domain identity (public key).

   Any registrar can contact the manufacturer or other trusted-by-the-
   device cloud resource to obtain a claim on a device.  This does not
   require the device to be online.  The claim is issued by the cloud

   resource in a non-discrimatory fashion to the unauthenticated
   registrar.  Claims can include a nonce generated by the device.  The
   registrar may drop the nonce.  The cloud service may drop the nonce.
   If the nonce is included in the resulting claim the device must
   verify this value against the current device state.

   The cloud resource should offer open and non-discrimatory audit
   functionalities associating the privacy protected registrar public
   key information with the device identity and any nonce information
   included.

2.7.  Services

   As the devices have a common trust anchor, device identity can be
   securely established, making it possible to automatically deploy
   services across the domain in a secure manner.

   Examples of services:

   o  Device management.

   o  Routing authentication.

   o  Service discovery.

2.8.  Network boundaries

   When a device has joined the domain, it can validate the domain
   membership of other devices.  This makes it possible to create trust
   boundaries where domain members have higher level of trusted than
   external devices.  Using the autonomic User Interface, specific
   devices can be grouped into to sub domains and specific trust levels
   can be implemented between those.

3.  Security Considerations

   The approach as outlined in this document is open to a number of
   attacks at bootstrap time.  For example, a malicious device could
   pretend to be an expected device and assume its role.

   There are counter-measures against these attacks, with various
   security levels, and corresponding various ease of use.  The options
   are (in order of increased security):

   o  Only allow new devices to join in a specific time period.

   o  Only allow specific devices to join by matching their serial
      numbers.

   o  Validating the vendor certificate on new devices using the vendors
      Cloud portal.

   In order to support a variety of use cases, devices can be claimed by
   a registrar without proving possession of the device in question.
   This would result in a nonceless, and thus always valid, claim.
   Future registrars are recommended to take the audit history of a
   device into account when deciding to join the device into their
   network.
