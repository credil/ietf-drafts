    <abstract>
      <t>This specification provides a general framework for the use of
      assertions as client credentials and/or authorization grants with OAuth
      2.0. It includes a generic mechanism for transporting assertions during
      interactions with a token endpoint, as wells as rules for the content
      and processing of those assertions. The intent is to provide an enhanced
      security profile by using derived values such as signatures or HMACs, as
      well as facilitate the use of OAuth 2.0 in client-server integration
      scenarios where the end-user may not be present.</t>

      <t>This specification only defines abstract message flow and assertion
      content. Actual use requires implementation of a companion protocol
      binding specification. Additional profile documents provide standard
      representations in formats such as SAML and JWT.</t>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf.oauth-v2">The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol
      </xref> provides a method for making authenticated HTTP requests to a
      resource using an access token. Access tokens are issued to clients by
      an authorization server with the (sometimes implicit) approval of the
      resource owner. These access tokens are typically obtained by exchanging
      an authorization grant representing authorization by the resource owner
      or privileged administrator. Several authorization grant types are
      defined to support a wide range of client types and user experiences.
      OAuth also allows for the definition of new extension grant types to
      support additional clients or to provide a bridge between OAuth and
      other trust frameworks. Finally, OAuth allows the definition of
      additional authentication mechanisms to be used by clients when
      interacting with the authorization server.</t>

      <t>In scenarios where security is at a premium one wants to avoid
      sending secrets across the Internet, even on encrypted connections.
      Instead one wants to send values derived from the secret that prove to
      the receiver that the sender is in possession of the secret without
      actually sending the secret. Typically the way derived values are
      created is by generating an assertion that is then either HMAC&rsquo;ed
      or digitally signed using an agreed upon secret. By validating the HMAC
      or digital signature on the assertion, the receiver can prove to
      themselves that the entity that generated the assertion was in
      possession of the secret without actually communicating the secret
      directly.</t>

      <t>This specification provides a general framework for the use of
      assertions as client credentials and/or authorization grants with OAuth
      2.0. It includes a generic mechanism for transporting assertions during
      interactions with a token endpoint, as wells as rules for the content
      and processing of those assertions. The intent is to provide an enhanced

    <section title="Authentication vs. Authorization">
      <t>This specification provides a model for using assertions for
      authentication of an OAuth client during interactions with an
      Authorization Server, as well as the use of assertions as authorization
      grants. It is important to note that the use of assertions for client
      authentication is orthogonal and separable from using assertions as an
      authorization grant and can be used either in combination or in
      isolation. In addition, in scenarios when assertion based authentication
      and authorization are used in combination, the assertion format and
      processing may be redundant; under such circumstances, the protocol may
      be optimized to present a single assertion.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Transporting Assertions">
      <t>This section defines generic HTTP parameters for transporting
      assertions during interactions with a token endpoint.</t>

      <section title="Using Assertions for Client Authentication">
        <t>In scenarios where one wants to avoid sending secrets, one wants to
        send values derived from the secret that prove to the receiver that
        the sender is in possession of the secret without actually sending the
        secret.</t>

        <t>For example, a client can establish a secret using an out-of-band
        mechanism with a resource server. As part of this out-of-band
        communication the client and resource server agree that the client
        will authenticate itself using an assertion with agreed upon
        parameters that will be signed by the provisioned secret. Later on,
        the client might send an access token request to the token endpoint
        for the resource server that includes an authorization code, as well
        as a client_assertion that is signed with the previously agreed key
        and parameters. The client_assertion proves to the token endpoint the
        identity of the client and the authorization code provides the link to
        the end-user authorization.</t>

        <t>The following section defines the use of assertions as client
        credentials as an extension of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf.oauth-v2">Section 3.2 of OAuth 2.0</xref>. When using
        assertions as client credentials, the client MUST include the
        assertion using the following HTTP request parameters:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="client_id">OPTIONAL. The client identifier as
            described in <xref target="I-D.ietf.oauth-v2">Section 3 of OAuth
            2.0</xref>.</t>

            <t hangText="client_assertion_type">REQUIRED. The format of the
            assertion as defined by the authorization server. The value MUST
            be an absolute URI.</t>

            <t hangText="client_assertion">REQUIRED. The assertion being used
            to authenticate the client. Specific serialization of the
            assertion is defined by profile documents. The serialization MUST
            be encoded for transport within HTTP forms. It is RECOMMENDED that
            base64url be used.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The following non-normative example demonstrates a client
        authenticating using an assertion during an Authorization Code Access
        Token Request as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf.oauth-v2">Section
        4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0</xref>. (line breaks are for display purposes

        <t></t>

        <t>The client MUST NOT include the client_credential using more than
        one mechanism. Token endpoints can differentiate between client
        assertion credentials and other client credential types by looking for
        the presence of the client_assertion and client_assertion_type
        attributes which will only be present with client assertion
        credentials. See section 7 for more details</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Using Assertions as Authorization Grants">
        <t>An assertion can be used to request an access token when a client
        wishes to utilize an existing trust relationship. This may be done
        through the semantics of (and a digital signature/HMAC calculated
        over) the assertion, and expressed to the authorization server
 		through an extension authorization grant type.
        The processes by which authorization is previously granted, and by
        which the client obtains the assertion prior to exchanging it with the
        authorization server, are out of scope.</t>

        <t>The following defines the use of assertions as authorization grants
        as an extension of <xref target="I-D.ietf.oauth-v2">OAuth 2.0</xref>,
        section 4.5. When using assertions as authorization grants, the client
        MUST include the assertion using the following HTTP request
        parameters:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="client_id">OPTIONAL. The client identifier as
            described in <xref target="I-D.ietf.oauth-v2">Section 3 of OAuth
            2.0</xref>.</t>

            <t hangText="grant_type">REQUIRED. The format of the assertion as
            defined by the authorization server. The value MUST be an absolute
            URI.</t>

            <t hangText="assertion">REQUIRED. The assertion being used as an
            authorization grant. Specific serialization of the assertion is
            defined by profile documents. The serialization MUST be encoded
            for transport within HTTP forms. It is RECOMMENDED that base64url
            be used.</t>

            <t hangText="scope">OPTIONAL. The request MAY contain a "scope"
            parameter. The scope of the access request is expressed as a list
            of space-delimited strings. The value is defined by the
            authorization server. If the value contains multiple space-
            delimited strings, their order does not matter, and each string
            adds an additional access range to the requested scope. When
            exchanging assertions for access_tokens, the authorization for the
            token has been previously granted through some other mechanism. As
            such, the requested scope SHOULD be equal or lesser than the scope
            originally granted to the authorized accessor. If the scope
            parameter and/or value is omitted, the scope SHOULD be treated as
            equal to the scope originally granted to the authorized accessor.
            The Authorization Server SHOULD limit the scope of the issued
            access token to be equal or lesser than the scope originally
            granted to the authorized accessor.</t>

      <section title="Assertion Metamodel">
        <t>The following are entities and metadata involved in the issuance,
        exchange and processing of assertions in OAuth 2.0. These are general
        terms, abstract from any particular assertion format. Mappings of
        these terms into specific representations are provided by profiles of
        this specification.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Issuer">The unique identifier for the entity that
            issued the assertion. Generally this is the entity that holds the
            keying material used to generate the assertion. In some use-cases
            Issuers may be either OAuth Clients (when assertions are
            self-asserted ) or a Security Token Service (an entity capable of
            issuing, renewing, transforming and validating of security
            tokens).</t>

            <t hangText="Principal">A unique identifier for the subject of the
            assertion. When using assertions for client authentication, the
            Principal SHOULD be the client_id of the OAuth client. When using
            assertions as an authorization grant, the Principal MUST identify
            an authorized accessor for whom the access token is being
            requested (typically the resource owner, or an authorized
            delegate).</t>

            <t hangText="Audience">A URI that identifies the party intended to 
			process the assertion.  The audience SHOULD be the URL of

            <t hangText="Issued At ">The time at which the assertion was
            issued. While the serialization may differ by assertion format,
            this is always expressed in UTC with no time zone component.</t>

            <t hangText="Expires At ">The time at which the assertion expires.

            <t hangText="Assertion ID">A nonce or unique identifier for the
            assertion. The Assertion ID may be used by implementations
            requiring message de-duplication for one-time use assertions. Any
            entity that assigns an identifier MUST ensure that there is
            negligible probability that that entity or any other entity will
            accidentally assign the same identifier to a different data
            object.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="General Assertion Format and Processing Rules">
        <t>The following are general format and processing rules for the use
        of assertions in OAuth:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The assertion MUST contain an Issuer. The Issuer MUST identify
            the entity that issued the assertion as recognized by the
            Authorization Server. If an assertion is self-asserted, the Issuer
            SHOULD be the client_id.</t>

            <t>The assertion SHOULD contain a Principal. The Principal MUST
            identify an authorized accessor for whom the access token is being
            requested ( typically the resource owner, or an authorized
            delegate ) When the client is acting on behalf of itself, the
            Principal SHOULD be the client_id.</t>

            <t>The assertion MUST contain an Audience that identifies the
            Authorization Server as the intended audience. The Authorization
            Server MUST verify that it is an intended audience for the
            assertion. The Audience SHOULD be the URL of the Authorization
            Server's Token Endpoint.</t>

            <t>The assertion MUST contain an Expires At entity that limits the
            time window during which the assertion can be used. The
            authorization server MUST verify that the expiration time has not
            passed, subject to allowable clock skew between systems. The
            authorization server SHOULD reject assertions with an Expires At
            attribute value that is unreasonably far in the future.</t>

            <t>The assertion MAY contain an Issued At entity containing the
            UTC time at which the assertion was issued.</t>

            <t>The assertion MAY contain an Assertion ID. An Authorization
            Server MAY dictate that Assertion ID is mandatory.</t>

            <t>The Authorization Server MUST validate the assertion in order
            to establish a mapping between the Issuer and the secret used to
            generate the assertion. The algorithm used to validate the
            assertion, and the mechanism for designating the secret used to
            generate the assertion is out-of-scope for this specification.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Specific Assertion Format and Processing Rules">
      <t>The following clarifies the format and processing rules defined in
      section 4 and section 5 for a number of common use-cases:</t>

      <section title="Client authentication">
        <t>When a client authenticates to a token service using an assertion,
        it SHOULD do so according to section 4.1. The following format and
        processing rules SHOULD be applied:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The client_id HTTP parameter SHOULD identify the client to the
            authorization server.</t>

            <t>The client_assertion_type HTTP parameter MUST identify the
            assertion format being used for authentication.</t>

            <t>The client_assertion HTTP parameter MUST contain the serialized
            assertion in a format indicated by the client_assertion_type
            parameter.</t>

            <t>The Issuer of the assertion MUST identify the entity that
            issued the assertion as recognized by the Authorization Server. If
            the assertion is self-asserted, the Issuer SHOULD be the
            client_id.</t>

            <t>The Principal MUST identify an authorized accessor. If the
            assertion is self-issued, the Principal SHOULD be the
            client_id.</t>

            <t>The Audience of the assertion MUST identify the Authorization
            Server and SHOULD be the URL of the Token Endpoint.</t>

            <t>The Authorization Server MUST validate the assertion in order
            to establish a mapping between the Issuer and the secret used to
            generate the assertion.</t>
          </list></t>

        is a special case that combines both the authentication and
        authorization grant usage patterns. In this case, the interactions
        with the authorization server SHOULD be treated as using an assertion
        for Client Authentication according to section 4.1, with the addition

        <t>When a client is accessing resources on behalf of a user, it SHOULD
        be treated as using an assertion as an Authorization Grant according
        to section 4.2. The following format and processing rules SHOULD be
        applied:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The client_id HTTP parameter MUST identify the client to the
            authorization server.</t>

            <t>The assertion HTTP parameter MUST contain the serialized
            assertion as in a format indicated by the grant_type
            parameter.</t>

            <t>The Issuer of the assertion MUST identify the entity that
            issued the assertion as recognized by the Authorization Server. If
            the assertion is self-asserted, the Issuer SHOULD be the
            client_id. If the assertion was issued by a STS, the Issuer SHOULD
            identify the STS as recognized by the Authorization Server.</t>

            <t>The Principal MUST identify an authorized accessor for whom the
            access token is being requested (typically the resource owner, or
            an authorized delegate).</t>

            <t>The Audience of the assertion MUST identify the Authorization
            Server and MAY be the URL of the Token Endpoint.</t>

            <t>The Authorization Server MUST validate the assertion in order

        <t>When a client is accessing resources on behalf of an anonymous
        user, the following format and processing rules SHOULD be
        applied:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The client_id HTTP parameter MUST identify the client to the
            authorization server.</t>

            <t>The grant_type HTTP request parameter MUST indicate the

            <t>The assertion HTTP parameter MUST contain the serialized
            assertion as in a format indicated by the grant_type
            parameter.</t>

            <t>The Issuer of the assertion MUST identify the entity that
            issued the assertion as recognized by the Authorization Server. If
            the assertion is self-asserted, the Issuer SHOULD be the
            client_id. If the assertion was issued by a Security Token
            Service, the Issuer SHOULD identify the STS as recognized by the
            Authorization Server.</t>

            <t>The Principal SHOULD indicate to the Authorization Server that
            the client is acting on-behalf of an anonymous user as defined by
            the Authorization Server. It is implied that authorization is based
            upon additional criteria, such as additional attributes or claims
            provided in the assertion. For example, a client may present an
            assertion from a trusted issuer asserting that the bearer is over
            18 via an included claim. In this case, no additional information
            about the user's identity is included yet all the data needed to
            issue an access token is present.</t>

            <t>The Audience of the assertion MUST identify the Authorization
            Server and MAY be the URL of the Token Endpoint.</t>

            <t>The Authorization Server MUST validate the assertion in order
            to establish a mapping between the Issuer and the secret used to
            generate the assertion.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Error Responses">
      <t>If an assertion is not valid or has expired, the Authorization Server
      MUST construct an error response as defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf.oauth-v2">OAuth 2.0</xref>. The value of the error
      parameter MUST be the "invalid_grant" error code. The authorization
      server MAY include additional information regarding the reasons the
      assertion was considered invalid using the "error_description" or
      "error_uri" parameters.</t>

      <t>For example:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

{
"error":"invalid_grant",
"error_description":"Audience validation failed"
}]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t></t>

      <t>A client MUST NOT include client credentials using more than one
      mechanism. Token endpoints can differentiate between assertion based
      credentials and other client credential types by looking for the
      presence of the client_assertion and client_assertion_type attributes
      which will only be present when using assertions for client
      authentication. If more than one mechanism is used, the Authorization
      Server MUST construct an error response as defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf.oauth-v2">OAuth 2.0</xref>. The value of the error
      parameter MUST be the &ldquo;invalid_client&rdquo; error code. The
      authorization server MAY include additional information regarding the
      reasons the client was considered invalid using the "error_description"
      or "error_uri" parameters.</t>

      <t>For example:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

{
"error":"invalid_client"
"error_description":"Multiple Credentials Not Allowed"
}]]></artwork>
      </figure>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

      <t>Authorization Providers concerned with preventing replay attacks may choose to implement using replay detection using a combination of the AssertionID and IssuedAt/ExpiredAt attributes.  Previously processed assertions MAY be de-duped and rejected based on the AssertionID.  The addition of the validity window relieves the authorization server from maintaining an infinite state table of processed assertion IDs.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>Authorization Servers SHOULD consider the amount of information exposed in error responses, and the risk associated with exposing details of specific processing errors.   In addition, Authorization Servers SHOULD prevent timing attacks related to cryptographic processing of the assertion.</t>
