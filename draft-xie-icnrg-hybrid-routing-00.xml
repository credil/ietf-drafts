			Name-based routing in information-centric networks faces many
			challenges, one of which is the scalability challenge; in
			particular, content routers may not have sufficiently large FIB to
			store a large portion of name prefixes, even if the latter are
			aggressively aggregated. In many ICN designs routers have to rely
			on inefficient mechanisms (e.g., Interest broadcast in
			content-centric networks) in order to route requests.  
			
			In this draft, we describe a hybrid, reactive routing approach,
			where we augment the information-centric network design with an
			Infrastructure Information Base (IIB) to reap the benefits of both
			name-based and infrastructure-based routing. Simulation-based
			evaluations demonstrate that this scheme can significantly improve
			the network scalability by cutting down the number of broadcast
			packets while maintaining the same level of the user-perceived

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	<t>
		
		Recently Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has become an
		increasingly popular research topic and many exciting efforts have been
		made. Among these efforts, two closely related proposals,
		Content-Centric Network (CCN) <xref target="ccn"/> and Named Data
		Networking (NDN) <xref target="ndn"/>, are attracting more and more
		attention. It has been a common belief that future networks are likely
		content-centric or information-centric, enabling the paradigm shift
		from the traditional "host-to-host" communication model to the
		``host-to-content'' or ``host-to-information'' model. Researchers have made
		rapid progresses towards this direction in recent years. 
	
	</t>
   
	
	<t>
		
		The name-based routing adopted by many ICN designs enables the new
		``host-to-content'' or ``host-to-information'' communication model. 
		
		In many ICN designs, content and information objects (referred to as
		content for short hereafter) have structured names. A content origin
		who owns the original content objects announces name prefixes into the
		network.  Such announcements can be propagated throughout the network
		(e.g., via intradomain routing protocols such as OSPF).
		
		For instance, in CCN, the Forward Information Base (FIB) in each router
		stores to which interface ("face") the router should forward any
		request for a named content matching a given name prefix.  Upon
		receiving name prefix announcements, each router updates its FIB
		accordingly. Clients send Interest packets requesting for interested
		content, and the network responds with Data packets of the requested
		content. ICN also introduce two new components to content routers:
		Content Store (CS) and Pending Interest Table (PIT). CS is leveraged to
		store cacheable content objects in order for efficient content
		distribution, and PIT is used to aggregate pending Interests for the
		same content and propagate Data packets, potentially in a multicast
		manner, towards the requesting clients.
	
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor="challenges" title="Challenges">
	<t>
		
		Name-based routing in information-centric networks also poses new
		concerns on network scalability. We use CCN as an example to illustrate
		the main concerns:

		<list style="symbols"> 
			
			<t> 
				
				Firstly, name prefix announcements in ICN have to be propagated
				throughout the network via either intradomain protocols such as
				OSPF or the like. However, the number of distinct name prefixes
				is expected to be enormously large; for instance, Google
				announced in July 2008 that the number of unique URLs it
				processed had exceeded 1 trillion. Even after extremely
				aggressive aggregation, the top-level name prefixes could still
				be enormously large.  Statistics have shown that as of December
				2011, the Internet has more than half a billion domain names
				and that the number of domain names has doubled in the past
				three years. To propagate such an enormously large number of
				name prefixes can be a daunting task in that it could not only
				dramatically overload routers but also consume a significant
				portion of network bandwidth.
	
			</t>

			<t>
		
				
				Secondly, the number of name prefixes is likely to be multiple
				orders of magnitude larger than what FIB can store, and the gap
				between these two mismatching numbers is likely to sustain.
				Hence, only a small portion of name prefixes could possibly be
				put in FIB. As a result, FIB misses (i.e., FIB has no knowledge
				about where to forward Interests) could be common and
				name-based routing has to heavily rely on some fall-back
				schemes (e.g., broadcast Interests), most likely on the slow
				path, to address FIB misses. This could dramatically degrade
				network performance and user experiences.
	
			</t>
			
			<t>
				
				Last but not least, the current fall-back scheme adopted in
				CCN, namely, flooding Interests via broadcast on FIB misses,
				could become another dominating source overloading routers,
				consuming a significant portion of network bandwidth, and
				degrading network performance.
	
			</t>

		</list>
	
	</t> 

	
	<t>
		
		In this draft, we consider the number of flooded packets as a metric
		suggesting the level of scalability, and describe a hybrid, reactive
		name-based routing approach in an attempt to address the aforementioned
		challenges on scalability in ICN. 

	</t>

</section>  <!-- introduction -->


<section anchor="considerations" title="Key Observations and Design Considerations">

	<t>
		
		We first describe a few key observations and design considerations in
		order to help understand the aforementioned challenges. We use CCN as
		an example scenario for concreteness.
	
	</t>

	<section anchor="routing" title="Proactive Routing vs. Reactive Routing">

		<t>   
			
			In many of the current ICN design, content origins (or their
			first-hop routers) are expected to pro-actively and periodically
			announce name prefixes that are owned by them, similar to how IP
			prefixes are announced in an intradomain network. We refer to this
			scheme as the proactive routing scheme. 
			
			For example, in CCN, re-using intradomain routing protocols (e.g.,
			OSPF with ICN adaptation) is proposed to propagate name prefixes to
			all routers in intradomain networks (see, e.g., <xref
				target="ccn"/>).
		
		</t> 

		<t>   
			
			However, proactive routing schemes face significant challenges due
			to the fact that the number of name prefixes can be tremendously
			large in practice. This has significant impacts on both network
			control overhead and FIB. More specifically, it is likely that the
			number of name prefixes is at least at the scale of domain names in
			the Internet, such re-use of OSPF-like proactive schemes could
			easily lead to stringent challenges on network scalability. For
			instance, assuming domain names with an average length of 16 bytes,
			announcements of 0.5 billion domain names can generate as high as 8
			billion bytes of traffic; if these names are announced in 1-minute
			intervals, then on each network link, the average bandwidth
			consumed by periodical active announcements alone is about 1 Gbps.
			Moreover, most likely the number of name prefixes, even after
			aggressive aggregation, is still much larger than the number of
			domain names. If the former is 10 times larger, then link bandwidth
			consumption due to name prefix announcement alone can be as high as
			10 Gbps. At this scale, it is likely that FIB can only store a
			limited, small number of name prefixes; thus FIB misses are not
			uncommon.
		
		</t>   

		<t>
		
			An alternative approach is the reactive routing scheme; namely,
			name prefixes are announced only when Interests for those prefixes
			are injected into the network. We believe that this scheme can be
			more preferable in information-centric networks. On the one hand,
			proactive announcements consume a significant portion of network
			bandwidth and may overload routers. When taking content popularity
			into account, announcing name prefixes for rarely or never accessed
			contents significantly wastes network bandwidth. On the other hand,
			because FIB sizes are multiple orders of magnitude smaller than the
			number of name prefixes, most name prefixes would not be able to
			fit in FIB; therefore, announcing such name prefixes not only
			wastes network bandwidth but also overload routers.
		
		</t>

		
		<t>
			
			The rationale behind the reactive routing scheme is that since FIB
			misses are inevitable, we should not require all names prefixes be
			squeezed into FIB (aggregation can still help to put as many
			prefixes as possible into FIB though). Instead, only those name
			prefixes that can maximize the network utility (e.g., reduce extra
			control overhead or service latency) should be put in FIB. 
			
			Thus, FIB has eviction policies that regulate which entries should
			be kept in or evicted from FIB. To some degree, FIB exhibits
			behaviors similar to the content cache, except that the former
			stores name prefixes while the latter stores named data.
		
		</t>

	</section>  <!-- routing -->

	<section anchor="broadcast" title="Interest Broadcast">

		<t>   
			
			The preceding description suggests that FIB misses could be common in
			ICN when the number of name prefixes is large.  FIB misses directly
			lead to Interest broadcast, which content routers have to rely on
			as the fall-back flooding mechanism to "search" for the content
			origin or a router that can fulfill the request. Therefore,
			Interest broadcast is likely common and can thus incur significant
			extra overhead to the network.  
			
		</t>   

		<t>   
			FIB hits, on the other hand, reflect a router's awareness of the
			content origin and enables the router to forward Interests to
			designated faces without flooding the network. However, FIB hits
			are likely heterogeneous; namely, an Interest resulting a FIB hit
			at one router may result a FIB miss at another, due to the fact
			that different router may decide to put different sets of name
			prefixes in their FIB. As a result, a previously FIB-hit Interest
			may still be broadcast by routers en route towards the content
			origin. It is favorable to leverage FIB hits as much as possible in
			a collective manner to reduce the number of flooded Interest as
			well as Data packets.
		
		</t>
        
	</section>  <!-- broadcast -->

	<section anchor="starvation" title="Interest Starvation Problem">

		
		<t> 
			
			In CCN, Interests can be held "pending" in PIT. An Interest is
			pending if another Interest for the same content has been
			previously forwarded out but the corresponding Data has not been
			received yet, and it has not yet been timed out in PIT. Upon
			receipt of an Interest requesting for the content that has been
			requested by an existing pending Interest in PIT, a content router
			does not forward it; instead, the router uses PIT to track which
			incoming face(s) it receives the Interest.  Thus, forwarding
			duplicate Interests for the same content can be avoided.

		</figure> 
		
		<t>   
			
			However, this design could lead to an Interest Starvation Problem,
			which we illustrate in the example network shown in Figure 1.  This
			network is an abbreviated figure of the Abilene network topology
			(left: west cost, right: east coast).

			In this example, Client A (connected to router 3) sends an Interest
			for a content owned by the origin connected to router 8. Router 3
			broadcasts the Interest to its neighbors 5, 6 and 0. 

		</t>   

		<t>   

			Some of the Interests broadcast towards the east coast, however,
			will never reach the origin. One can observe that the Interest
			forwarded from 1 to 7 and the Interest from 7 to 1 will both lead
			to a PIT hit at router 7 and 1, respectively (and thus no further
			counterclockwise Interest forwarding to 4 or even 5). Consequently,
			when router 5 receives the returned Data, it will not forward it to
			router 4, as its PIT does not have a pending Interest coming from
			4. In other words, although router 4's and 1's PIT has a pending
			Interest, they are unlikely to receive the Data. This in turn
			results in the starvation of future Interests requesting for the
			same content. For instance, when Client B requests for the same
			content at a later time (but before PIT expires the pending
			Interest), router 1 does not forward the Interest due to PIT hit.
			In this case, B may only be able to successfully receive the data
			when the corresponding PIT entry expires in router 1.
		
		</t>

		
		<t>
			
			Note that for any new content which has not been requested for, it
			is more likely that the interest starvation occurs in flash crowd
			scenarios, and such starvation can happen within a limited duration
			(mainly determined by the timers expiring pending PIT entries).
			However, it is likely in practice that FIB has misses, thus
			interest starvation could still occur even for old content.

			Firstly, we require that every router in the network have a unique
			name and announce its name to all other routers via available
			intradomain routing protocols.
		
		</t>

		<t>   
			
			Secondly, we introduce a new component, the Infrastructure
			Information Base (IIB), to reap the benefits of
			infrastructure-oriented routing. Specifically, IIB stores the
			forwarding face(s) to reach any router in the network. Note that
			IIB stores reachability information for an intradomain network and
			in typical intradomain networks the number of routers ranges from a
			few dozen to a couple of thousand. Thus the size of IIB would be
			less than a couple of thousand.  
			
		</t>   

		<t>   

			Since we require that routers announce their names using
			intradomain routing protocols, each router is able to build IIB on
			their own. Multi-path routing is feasible if multiple forwarding
			faces are allowed in any IIB entry; however, routing loop
			prevention schemes should be adopted (we leave it as a future work)
			Note that if only a single forwarding face is allowed in any IIB
			entry, then we end up with single-path routing and lose the
			benefits of potentially multi-path routing in ICN; however, the
			gain is simplified routing and improved scalability.  
		
		</t>

		<t>   
			
			Thirdly, we change the semantics of the original FIB. Specifically,
			each FIB entry now stores a name prefix and the names of "landmark"
			routers for this prefix. We refer to a router as a landmark router
			for a given name prefix if the router for sure has knowledge about
			how to reach the origin(s) of the name prefix. For instance, the
			router closest to an origin can be treated as the landmark router
			for the name prefixes announced by that origin. Since Data packets
			bears the origin's name (or an intermediate router's name), upon
			receipt of such a Data packet, a router can update its FIB
			accordingly.
		
		</t>

		<t>   
			
			Lastly, we allow FIB to update its entries (i.e., routes) based on
			the popularity (or relevant, carrier-chosen measures) of individual
			routes. To some degree, now FIB is more like a cache for routes.
			Certain caching policies can be applied to evict cold routes in
			order to save space for popular routes. Keep in mind that the
			fall-back mechanisms (e.g., flooding-based mechanisms) can be used
			as the last resort in case of FIB misses (namely, no route is known
			for a given name or name prefix). The requests of FIB lookup for
			popular contents (triggered by interest packets destined for
			popular contents) account for a majority of the FIB lookup
			workload, thus storing popular routes is beneficial and improves
			the overall performance of the network.
		
		</t>

		<t>   
			
			The other two components, Content Store and Pending Interest Table,
			remain the same as the original CCN/NDN design.

		   In the Interest packet, we introduce a Broadcast flag bit to
		   distinguish the broadcast Interest (i.e., B Interest) and
		   non-broadcast Interest (i.e., NB Interest), and introduce a
		   Destination field, as shown in the Figure 3.

		   An NB Interest is generally produced after a FIB hit at a router.
		   Clearly the router has some knowledge about the content and the
		   origin. In order to better leverage this knowledge, we let the
		   router fill in the Destination field in the NB Interest with the
		   name of a landmark router en route towards the origin (we recommend
		   the router closest to the origin as the landmark). Other routers
		   that receive such an Interest with this field filled out can
		   therefore take advantage of this knowledge; however, it is
		   recommended but not mandatory that routers should use the
		   destination information in its decision process.  In a B Interest,
		   the destination field is always left empty.
	   
	   </t>

	   <t>
		   
		   In the Data packet, we introduce a Source field for the content
		   origin's identification, which provides a reference for updating
		   FIB. Note that the origin can obfuscated its own name (e.g., a hash
		   of its name) for privacy preservation purposes.  Note also that
		   there can be multiple origins for a given content and that
		   intermediate routers may override this field with its own name.

   <section anchor="reactive" title="Packet Handling">

	   <t> 
		   
		   We now describe how content routers should handle packets in the
		   reactive routing scheme.
	   
	   </t> 
		
       <section anchor="handling" title="Handling Interest Packet">

		   
		   <t>
			   
			   The new Interest handling method is presented as below.
			   According to our preceding description, the unsatisfied PIT hit
			   could cause starvation of future Interests. We address this
			   problem with a novel patch utilizing the broadcast flag.  Note
			   that the key property of the starvation is the underlying ring
			   topology (e.g., the ring including routers 3,0,10,7,1,4,5 in
			   Fig. 1) and some routers on the ring (e.g., router 1) prohibit
			   forwarding further Interests per their PIT policy (their PIT is
			   in a mistaken state though). This starvation can be prevented by
			   allowing routers such as router 1 to further forward the
			   Interest. In Fig. 1, this corresponds to the Interest forwarding
			   from 1 to 4 and further to 5 (as well as from 7 to 10 and
			   further). When 5 receives the Data packet, this packet will also
			   be forwarded to all routers along the ring. In this way, the
			   broadcast Interest can traverse the ring topology in both
			   clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Consequently, once
			   any router in the ring receives the Data packet, all other
			   routers will eventually clear the corresponding PIT entry. The
			   above strategy indicates the following rule in the treatment of
			   the broadcast Interest: when the broadcast Interest is not from
			   a face existing in PIT (even if the corresponding content is
			   pending), the Interest will still be further broadcasted. Note
			   that in this rule the broadcast Interest from an existing face
			   for the pending content can still be aggregated. 
		   
		   </t> 
	
		   
		   <t>    
			   
			   For any broadcast Interest, it is eventually replied with the
			   desired content if found in CS.  Otherwise, if the incoming
			   faces have no previous requests for the same content, it is
			   broadcasted further if FIB has no destination information for
			   the requested content.  However, if FIB does have the
			   destination information, then the Interest will be forward as a
			   non-broadcast Interest (NB) (by changing the broadcast flag bit
			   and fill the destination field) to faces towards the
			   destination. 
		   
		   </t> 
		   
		   <t>
			   
			   For any non-broadcast Interest, since the destination is already
			   filled, we can directly forward it according to IIB in a unicast
			   manner. We can also fall back to the original CCN/NDN design and
			   adopt a broadcast approach to forward the Interest. Still, we
			   require that intermediate routers directly reply with the
			   content data in case of a CS hit. 
		   
		   </t>

       <section anchor="data" title="Handling Data Packet">

		   <t>
			   
			   Handling Data packets is similar to the original CCN/NDN design.
			   When a Data packet matches a PIT entry, it will be forwarded to
			   all faces designated by the PIT entry along with a FIB update.
			   Note that the origin or the router closest to the origin should
			   update the destination field in the packet.

<section anchor="conclusion" title="Conclusion">
	
	<t>
		
		In this draft, we describe a hybrid, reactive information-centric
		routing scheme to address the scalability challenge for intradomain
		networks. In the design, an Infrastructure Information Base (IIB) is
		introduced to augment the original CCN content router design with new
		packet handling algorithms. The describe reactive routing scheme can
		lead to less broadcast packets than the original proactive scheme
		(simulation-based evaluations suggest that the reduction of broadcast
		packets could be as high as two orders of magnitude). It can also
		address the Interest Starvation Problem, and effectively reduces the
		broadcast Interest after the FIB hit.
