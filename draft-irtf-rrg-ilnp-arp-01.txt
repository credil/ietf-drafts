   broader review than the IRTF Routing RG. The views in this
   document were considered controversial by the Routing RG, but the
   RG reached a consensus that the document still should be
   published. The Routing RG has had remarkably little consensus on
   anything, so virtually all Routing RG outputs are considered
   controversial.

Abstract

   This document defines an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
   extension to support ILNP for IPv4 (ILNPv4). ILNP is is an
   experimental, evolutionary enhancement to IP. This document is a
   product of the IRTF Routing RG.

1. INTRODUCTION

   The Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) is an proposal for
   evolving the Internet Architecture. It differs from the current
   Internet Architecture primarily by deprecating the concept of an
   IP Address, and instead defining two new objects, each having

   crisp syntax and semantics. The first new object is the Locator, a
   topology-dependent name for a subnetwork. The other new object is
   the Identifier, which provides a topology-independent name for a
   node.

1.1  ILNP Document Roadmap

   The ILNP Architecture document [ILNP-ARCH] is the best place to
   start reading about ILNP. ILNP has multiple instantiations.
   [ILNP-ENG] discusses engineering and implementation aspects common
   to all instances of ILNP. This document discusses engineering and
   implementation details that are specific to ILNP for IPv4
   (ILNPv4). [ILNP-DNS] describes new Domain Name System (DNS)
   resource records used with ILNP. [ILNP-ICMPv4] defines the ICMP
   Locator Update message used with ILNPv4. [ILNP-v4opts] defines new
   IPv4 options for use with ILNPv4. Other documents describe ILNP
   for IPv6 (ILNPv6) [ILNP-ICMPv6] [ILNP-NONCE6].

1.2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119. [RFC-2119]

2.  ARP Extensions for ILNPv4

   ILNP for IPv4 (ILNPv4) is merely a different instantiation of the
   ILNP architecture, so it retains the crisp distinction between the
   Locator and the Identifier. As with ILNPv6, only the Locator
   values are used for routing and forwarding ILNPv4 packets
   [ILNP-ARCH]. As with ILNP for IPv6 (ILNPv6), when ILNPv4 is used
   for a network-layer session, the upper-layer protocols (e.g.
   TCP/UDP pseudo-header checksum, IPsec Security Association) bind
   only to the Identifiers, never to the Locators [ILNP-ENG].

   However, just as the packet format for IPv4 is different to IPv6,
   so the engineering details for ILNPv4 are different also. While
   ILNPv6 is carefully engineered to be fully backwards-compatible
   with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, ILNPv4 relies upon an extended
   version of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) which is defined
   here. While ILNPv4 could have been engineered to avoid changes in
   ARP, that would have required that the ILNPv4 Locator (i.e. L32)
   have slightly different semantics, which was architecturally
   undesirable.

   The packet formats used are direct extensions of the existing
   widely deployed ARP Request (Opcode 1) and ARP Reply (Opcode 2)

   packet formats. This design was chosen for practical engineering
   reasons (i.e. to maximise code reuse), rather than for maximum
   protocol design purity.

   We anticipate that ILNPv6 is much more likely to be widely
   implemented and deployed than ILNPv4. However, having a clear
   definition of ILNPv4 helps demonstrate the difference between
   architecture and engineering, and also demonstrates that the
   common ILNP architecture can be instantiated in different ways
   with different existing network-layer protocols.

2.1  ILNPv4 ARP Request Packet Format

   The ILNPv4 ARP Request (OP code XXX) is an extended version of the
   widely deployed ARP Request (Opcode 1). This extension permits the
   node's Identifier (I) values to be carried in the ARP message, in
   addition to the node's 32-bit Locator (L32) values [ILNP-DNS].

2.2  ILNPv4 ARP Reply Packet Format

   The ILNPv4 ARP Reply (OP code YYY) is an extended version of the
   widely deployed ARP Reply (OP code 2). This extension permits the
   node's Identifier (I) values to be carried in the ARP message, in
   addition to the node's 32-bit Locator (L32) values [ILNP-DNS].

   the existing ARP Reply (Opcode 2), except that the ILNPv4 ARP
   Reply is sent only by nodes that support ILNPv4.

2.3 Operation and Implementation of ARP for ILNPv4

   The operation of ARP for ILNPv4 is almost identical to that for
   IPv4. Essentially, the key difference is:

    a) where an IPv4 ARP Request would use IPv4 addresses, an
       ILNPv4 ARP Request MUST use:
        1. a 32-bit L value (_L32 suffixes in Figs 2.1 & 2.2)
        2. a 64-bit I value (_I64 suffixes in Figs 2.1 & Fig 2.2)

    b) where an IPv4 ARP Reply would use IPv4 addresses, an
       ILNPv4 ARP Reply MUST use:
        1. a 32-bit L value (_L32 suffixes in Figs 2.1 & 2.2)
        2. a 64-bit I value (_I64 suffixes in Figs 2.1 & Fig 2.2)

   As the OP codes XXX and YYY are distinct from ARP for IPv4, but
   the packet formats are Figs 2.1 and 2.2 are, effectively, extended
   versions of the corresponding ARP packets, it should be possible
   to implement this extension of ARP by extending existing ARP
   implementations rather than having to write an entirely new
   implementation for ILNPv4.


3.  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS




Atkinson & Bhatti  Expires in 6 months                          [Page 6]

Internet Draft     ILNPv4 ARP         26 MAR 2012


   Security considerations for the overall ILNP Architecture are
   described in [ILNP-ARCH]. Additional common security
   considerations applicable to ILNP are described in [ILNP-ENG].
   This section describes security considerations specific to the
   specific ILNPv4 topics discussed in this document.

   The existing widely deployed Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for
   IP version 4 (IPv4) is a link-layer protocol, so it is not
   vulnerable to off-link attackers. In this way, it is a bit
   different than IPv6 Neighbor Discovery; IPv6 ND is a subset of the
   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which runs over the
   Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).

   However, ARP does not include any form of authentication, so
   current ARP deployments are vulnerable to a range of attacks from
   on-link nodes. For example, it is possible for one node on a link
   to forge an ARP packet claiming to be from another node, thereby
   "stealing" the other node's IPv4 address. [RFC-5227] both
   describes several of these risks and also describes some measures
   that an ARP implementation can use to reduce the chance of
   accidental IPv4 address misconfiguration and also to detect such
   misconfiguration if it should occur.

   This extension does not change the security risks that are
   inherent in using ARP.

   In situations where additional protection against on-link
   attackers is needed, for example within high-risk operational
   environments, the IEEE standards for link-layer security
   [IEEE-802.1-AE] SHOULD be implemented and deployed.


4.  IANA CONSIDERATIONS

   In accordance with [RFC-5494], IANA is requested to assign new
   Operation Codes in the Address Resolution Protocol Parameters
   registry to the "ILNPv4 ARP Request" message (with value XXX
   above) and to the "ILNPv4 ARP Reply" message (with value YYY)
   above.

RFC EDITOR NOTE

   This section is to be removed prior to publication.

   This document is written in English, not American.  So English
   spelling is used throughout, rather than American spelling.
   This is consistent with existing practice in several other RFCs,
   for example RFC-5887.

   This document tries to be very careful with history, in the
   interest of correctly crediting ideas to their earliest
   identifiable author(s).  So in several places the first published
   RFC about a topic is cited rather than the most recent published
   RFC about that topic.
