      <t>Further specification documents may define a meaning for these flag
      bits. Defining the bits 17-20 as flags for all IPv6 multicast addresses
      allows addresses to be treated in a more uniform and generic way, and
      allows for these bits to be defined in the future for different
      purposes, irrespective of the specific type of multicast address.</t>

        <t>Some implementations and specification documents do not treat the
        flag bits as separate bits but tend to use their combined value as a
        4-bit integer. This practice is a hurdle for assigning a meaning to
        the remaining flag bits. Below are listed some examples for
        illustration purposes:<list style="symbols">
            <t>the reading of <xref target="RFC3306"></xref> may lead to
            conclude that ff3x::/32 is the only allowed SSM IPv6 prefix
            block.</t>

            <t><xref target="RFC3956"></xref> states only ff70::/12 applies to
            Embedded-RP. Particularly, implementations should not treat the
            fff0::/12 range as Embedded-RP.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>To avoid such confusion and to unambiguously associate a meaning
        with the remaining flags, the following requirement is made</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>Implementations MUST treat flag bits as separate bits.</t>

                                      +-+-+-+-+

   When the highest-order bit is 0, R = 1 indicates a multicast address
   that embeds the address on the RP.  Then P MUST be set to 1, and
   consequently T MUST be set to 1, as specified in [RFC3306].  In
   effect, this implies the prefix FF70::/12.  In this case, the last 4
   bits of the previously reserved field are interpreted as embedding
   the RP interface ID, as specified in this memo.

   The behavior is unspecified if P or T is not set to 1, as then the
   prefix would not be FF70::/12.  Likewise, the encoding and the
   protocol mode used when the two high-order bits in "flgs" are set to
   11 ("FFF0::/12") is intentionally unspecified until such time that
   the highest-order bit is defined.  Without further IETF
   specification, implementations SHOULD NOT treat the FFF0::/12 range
   as Embedded-RP.

   R = 1 indicates a multicast address that embeds the address of the RP.
   P MUST be set to 1, and consequently T MUST be set to 1, according
   to [RFC3306], as this is a special case of
   unicast-prefix based addresses. This implies that for instance prefixes
   ff70::/12 and fff0::/12 are embedded RP prefixes, but all multicast
   addresses with the R-bit set to 1 MUST be treated as Embedded RP
   addresses. The behavior is unspecified if P or T is not set to 1. When the
   R-bit is set, the last 4 bits of the previously reserved field are
   interpreted as embedding the RP interface ID, as specified in this memo.
