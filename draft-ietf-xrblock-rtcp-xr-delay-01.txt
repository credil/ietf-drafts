Internet-Draft                RTCP XR Delay                December 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Packet Delay Metrics Block

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the mean, minimum and maximum values of the
   network round-trip delay between RTP interfaces in peer RTP end
   systems as measured, for example, using the RTCP method described in
   [RFC3550].  It also supports reporting of the component of the round-
   trip delay internal to the local RTP system.

   The network metrics belong to the class of packet transport delay
   metrics defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions or
   define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines in
   [RFC6390].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications.

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Delay Block

   Metrics in this block report on packet delay in the stream arriving
   at the RTP system.  Instances of this Metrics Block refer by SSRC to
   the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block [MEASI] which
   contains measurement intervals.  This metric block relies on the
   measurement interval in the Measurement Information block indicating
   the span of the report.  If the measurement interval is not received
   for this metric block, this metric block should be discarded.

                     Figure 1: Report Block Structure

3.2.  Definition of Fields in Delay Metrics Report Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Delay Report Block is identified by the constant NDEL.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NDEL with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Basic Loss/Discard
      metrics are sampled,Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is,
      whether the reported values applies to the most recent measurement
      interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=10) (the
      Interval Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=11) (the Cumulative Duration) or to the
      value of a continuously measured or calculated that has been
      sampled at end of the interval (I=01) (Sampled Value).

Internet-Draft                RTCP XR Delay                December 2011


   Reserved (resv): 6 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to zero by senders
      and MUST be ignored by receivers.


   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Delay block, the block length is equal to 3.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].


   Mean Network Round Trip Delay (ms): 16 bits

      The Mean Network Round Trip Delay is the mean value of the RTP-to-
      RTP interface round trip delay in ms over the measurement period,
      typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.

      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      timespan of the report (whether Interval or Cumulative), this
      single value should be reported as the mean value.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.


   End System Delay (ms): 16 bits

      The End System Delay is the internal round trip delay within the
      reporting endpoint, calculated using the nominal value of the
      jitter buffer delay plus the accumulation/ encoding and decoding /
      playout delay associated with the codec being used.

      If the measured or estimated value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
      0xFFFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.
      If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be
      reported.

Internet-Draft                RTCP XR Delay                December 2011


   Min Network Round Trip Delay (ms): 16 bits

      The Min Network Round Trip Delay is the minimum value of the RTP-
      to-RTP interface round trip delay in ms over the measurement
      period, typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.

      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      timespan of the report (whether Interval or Cumulative), this
      single value should be reported as the minimum value.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

   Max Network Round Trip Delay (ms): 16 bits

      The Max Network Round Trip Delay is the maximum value of the RTP-
      to-RTP interface round trip delay in ms over the measurement
      period, typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.

      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      timespan of the report (whether Interval or Cumulative), this
      single value should be reported as the maximum value.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

4.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format =/ xr-delay-block

   xr-delay-block ="delay"

5.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NDEL in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "Delay Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NDEL with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

5.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "delay" in the "RTCP XR
   SDP Parameters Registry".

5.3.  Contact information for registrations


   The contact information for the registrations is:

6.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
