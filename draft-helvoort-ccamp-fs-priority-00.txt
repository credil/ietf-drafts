1. Introduction

   The external commands, Manual Switch and Forced Switch, provide an
   operator the ability to control the recovery schemes. The
   definitions in [RFC4427] provide an informative description but do
   not provide enough description to distinguish the processing of
   these commands for usage with priority treatment. The current
   description has led to the open question of how the commands are to
   be processed for relative priority treatment.

   This document provides clarification of the terms relative to
   [G.808.1].

Internet-Draft      Update Forced Switch Priority            July 2013


2. Manual Switch and Forced Switch

   This section updates [RFC4427]. Section 4.13 of [RFC4427] contains
   the following text regarding the definitions:

   D. Forced switch-over for normal traffic:

      A switch-over action, initiated externally, that switches normal
      traffic to the recovery LSP/span, unless an equal or higher
      priority switch-over command is in effect.

   E. Manual switch-over for normal traffic:

      A switch-over action, initiated externally, that switches normal
      traffic to the recovery LSP/span, unless a fault condition exists
      on other LSPs/spans (including the recovery LSP/span) or an equal
      or higher priority switch-over command is in effect.

   This definition does not provide enough detail with respect to their
   usage relative to priorities. In order to avoid mis-interpretation,
   this document adds the following Note as clarification:

   Note:

      For 1+1 protection schemes (which do not use a communication
      channel), a Forced Switch over for normal traffic will have the
      highest priority, it will not be overridden by a signal fail on
      the protection channel. For other protection schemes (which do use
      a communication channel), a Forced Switch over for normal traffic
      will be overridden if a signal fail is present on the protection
      channel. Definitions of ITU-T terminology in this section are
      intended to aid understanding of the concepts. For the full
      definition of these terms and their use, the reader is referred to
      the appropriate ITU-T Recommendations and RFCs.

3. Security Considerations

   This document clarifies usage of terms defined in [RFC4427]. No new
   information is conveyed; therefore no additional considerations are
   included here.

4. IANA Considerations

   There are no items for IANA to consider.
