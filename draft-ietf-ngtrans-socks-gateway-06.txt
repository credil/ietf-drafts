This document describes a SOCKS-based IPv6/IPv4 gateway mechanism
that enables smooth heterogeneous communications between the IPv6
nodes and IPv4 nodes.
 
It is based on the SOCKS protocol.  By applying the SOCKS
mechanism to the heterogeneous communications and relaying two
"terminated" IPv4 and IPv6 connections at the "application layer"
(the SOCKS server), the SOCKS-based IPv6/IPv4 gateway mechanism is
accomplished.
 
Since it is accomplished without introducing new protocols, it
provides the same communication environment that is provided by the
SOCKS mechanism.  The same appearance is provided to the heterogeneous
communications.  No conveniences or functionalities of current
communications are sacrificed.
