 Simulating "Partial Mesh of MP2MP P-Tunnels" with Ingress Replication
        draft-zzhang-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-ingress-replication-01.txt

Abstract

   RFC 6513 described a method to support bidirectional C-flow using
   "Partial Mesh of MP2MP P-Tunnels".  This document describes how
   partial mesh of MP2MP P-Tunnels can be simulated with Ingress
   Replication, instead of a real MP2MP tunnel.  This enables a Service
   Provider to use Ingress Replication to offer transparent BIDIR-PIM
   service to its VPN customers.

Internet-Draft           C-Bidir support with IR            October 2013


1.  Introduction

   Section 11.2 of RFC 6513, "Partitioned Sets of PEs", describes two
   methods of carrying bidirectional C-flow traffic over a provider core
   without using the core as RPL or requiring Designated Forwarder
   election.

   With these two methods, all PEs of a particular VPN are separated
   into partitions, with each partition being all the PEs that elect the
   same PE as the Upstream PE wrt the C-RPA.  A PE must discard
   bidirectional C-flow traffic from PEs that are not in the same
   partition as the PE itself.

   In particular, Section 11.2.3 of RFC 6513, "Partial Mesh of MP2MP
   P-Tunnels", guarantees the above discard behavior without using an
   extra PE Distinguisher label by having all PEs in the same partition
   join a single MP2MP tunnel dedicated to that partition and use it to
   transmit traffic.  All traffic arriving on the tunnel will be from
   PEs in the same partition, so it will be always accepted.

   RFC 6514 specifies BGP encodings and procedures used to implement
   MVPN as specified in RFC 6513, while the details related to MP2MP
   tunnels are specified in [draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05].

   [draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05] assumes that an MP2MP P-tunnel is
   realized either via PIM-Bidir, or via MP2MP mLDP.  Each of them would
   require signaling and state not just on PEs, but on the P routers as
   well.  This document describes how the MP2MP tunnel can be simulated
   with a mesh of P2MP tunnels, each of which is instantiated by Ingress
   Replication.  This does not require each PE on the MP2MP tunnel to
   send an S-PMSI A-D route for the P2MP tunnel that the PE is the root
   for, nor does it require each PE to send a Leaf A-D route to the root
   of each P2MP tunnel in the mesh.

   With the use of Ingress Replication,this scheme has both the
   advantages and the disadvantages of Ingress Replication in general.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from [RFC6513], [RFC6514], and
   [draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05].  In particular, the following new
   term is defined:

   o  C-G-BIDIR: A C-G where G is a Bidir-PIM group.

3.  Operation

   In following sections, the originator of an S-PMSI A-D route or Leaf
   A-D route is determined from the "originating router's IP address"
   field of the corresponding route.

3.1.  Control State

   If a PE, say PEx, is connected to a site of a given VPN, and PEx's
   next hop interface to some C-RPA is a VRF interface, then PEx MUST
   advertises a (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route, regardless of whether it
   has any local Bidir-PIM join states corresponding to the C-RPA
   learned from its CEs.  It MAY also advertise one or more (C-*,C-G-
   BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route, just like how any other S-PMSI A-D routes
   are triggered.  Here the C-G-BIDIR refers to a C-G where G is a
   Bidir-PIM group, and the corresponding C-RPA is in the site that the
   PEx connects to.  For example, the (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D routes
   could be triggered when the (C-*, C-G-BIDIR) traffic rate goes above
   a threshold, and fan-out could also be taken into account.  Note that
   this requires measuring the traffic in both directions, due to the
   nature of Bidir-PIM.

   The S-PMSI A-D routes include a PMSI Tunnel Attribute (PTA) with
   tunnel type set to Ingress Replication, with Leaf Information
   Required flag set, with a downstream allocated MPLS label that other
   PEs in the same partition MUST use when sending relevant C-bidir
   flows to this PE, and with the Tunnel Identifier field in the PTA set
   to a routable address of the originator.  The label may be shared
   with other P-tunnels, subject to the anti-ambiguity rules for
   extranet.  For example, the (C-*,C-BIDIR) and (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI
   A-D routes originated by a given PE can optionally share a label.

   If some other PE, PEy, receives and imports into one of its VRFs any
   (C-*, C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route whose PTA specifies an IR P-tunnel,
   and the VRF has any local Bidir-PIM join state that PEy has received
   from its CEs, and if PEy chooses PEx as its Upstream PE wrt the C-RPA
   for those states, PEy MUST advertise a Leaf A-D route in response.
   Or, if PEy has received and imported into one of its VRFs a (C-*,C-
   BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route from PEx before, then upon receiving in the
   VRF any local Bidir-PIM join state from its CEs with PEx being the
   Upstream PE for those states' C-RPA, PEy MUST advertise a Leaf A-D
   route.

   The encoding of the Leaf A-D route is as specified in RFC 6514,
   except that the Route Targets are set to the same value as in the
   corresponding S-PMSI A-D route so that the Leaf A-D route will be
   imported by all VRFs that import the corresponding S-PMSI A-D route.
   This is irrespective of whether from a receiving PE, PEz's

   perspective PEx (originator of the S-PMSI A-D route) is the Upstream
   PE or not.  The label in the PTA of the Leaf A-D route originated by
   PEy MUST be allocated specifically for PEx, so that when traffic
   arrives with that label, the traffic can associated with the
   partition (represented by the PEx).  The label may be shared with
   other P-tunnels, subject to the anti-ambiguity rules for extranet.
   For example, the (C-*,C-BIDIR) and (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D routes
   originated by a given PE can optionally share a label.

   Note that RFC 6514 requires a PE/ASBR take no action with regard to a
   Leaf A-D route unless that Leaf A-D route carries an IP Address
   Specific RT identifying the PE/ASBR.  This document removes that
   requirement when the route key of a Leaf A-D route identifies a
   (C-*,C-BIDIR) or a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI.

   To speed up convergence (so that PEy starts receiving traffic from
   its new Upstream PE immediately instead of waiting until the new Leaf
   A-D route corresponding to the new Upstream PE is received by sending
   PEs), PEy MAY advertise a Leaf A-D route even if does not choose PEx
   as its Upstream PE wrt the C-RPA.  With that, it will receive traffic
   from all PEs, but some will arrive with the label corresponding to
   its choice of Upstream PE while some will arrive with a different
   label, and the traffic in the latter case will be discarded.

   Similar to the (C-*,C-BIDIR) case, if PEy receives and imports into
   one of its VRFs any (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route whose PTA
   specifies an IR P-tunnel, and PEy chooses PEx as its Upstream PE wrt
   the C-RPA, and it has corresponding local (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join state
   that it has received from its CEs in the VRF, PEy MUST advertise a
   Leaf A-D route in response.  Or, if PEy has received and imported
   into one of its VRFs a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route before, then
   upon receiving its local (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join state from its CEs in
   the VRF, it MUST advertise a Leaf A-D route.

   The encoding of the Leaf A-D route is as specified in RFC 6514,
   except that the Route Targets are set to the same as in the
   corresponding S-PMSI A-D route so that the Leaf A-D route will be
   imported by all VRFs that import the corresponding S-PMSI A-D route.
   This is irrespective of whether from the receiving PE, PEz's
   perspective PEx (originator of the S-PMSI A-D route) is the Upstream
   PE or not.  The label in the PTA of the Leaf A-D route originated by
   PEy MUST be allocated specifically for PEx, so that when traffic
   arrives with that label, the traffic can associated with the
   partition (represented by the PEx).  The label may be shared with
   other P-tunnels, subject to the anti-ambiguity rules for extranet.
   For example, the (C-*,C-BIDIR) and (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D routes
   originated by a given PE can optionally share a label.

Internet-Draft           C-Bidir support with IR            October 2013


   Whenever the (C-*,C-BIDIR) or (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route is
   withdrawn, or if PEy no longer chooses the originator PEx as its
   Upstream PE wrt C-RPA and PEy only advertises Leaf A-D routes in
   response to its Upstream PE's S-PMSI A-D route, or if relevant local
   join state is pruned, PEy MUST withdraw the corresponding Leaf A-D
   route.

3.2.  Forwarding State

   The following specification regarding forwarding state matches the
   "When an S-PMSI is a 'Match for Transmission'" and "When an S-PMSI is
   a 'Match for Reception'" rules for "Flat Partitioning" method in
   [draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05], except that the rules about
   (C-*,C-*) are not applicable, because this document requires that
   (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D routes are always originated for a VPN that
   supports C-Bidir flows.

   For the (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route that a PEy receives and
   imports into one of its VRFs from its Upstream PE wrt the C-RPA, or
   if PEy itself advertises the S-PMSI A-D route in the VRF, PEy
   maintains a (C-*,C-G-BIDR) forwarding state in the VRF, with the
   Ingress Replication provider tunnel leaves being the originators of
   the S-PMSI A-D route and all relevant Leaf-A-D routes.  The relevant
   Leaf A-D routes are the routes whose Route Key field contains the
   same information as the MCAST-VPN NLRI of the (C-*, C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI
   A-D route advertised by the Upstream PE.

   For the (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route that a PEy receives and
   imports into one of its VRFs from its Upstream PE wrt a C-RPA, or if
   PEy itself advertises the S-PMSI A-D route in the VRF, it maintains
   appropriate forwarding states in the VRF for the ranges of
   bidirectional groups for which the C-RPA is responsible.  The
   provider tunnel leaves are the originators of the S-PMSI A-D route
   and all relevant Leaf-A-D routes.  The relevant Leaf A-D routes are
   the routes whose Route Key field contains the same information as the
   MCAST-VPN NLRI of the (C-*, C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route advertised by
   the Upstream PE.  This is for the so-called "Sender Only Branches"
   where a router only has data to send upstream towards C-RPA but no
   explicit join state for a particular bidirectional group.  Note that
   the traffic must be sent to all PEs (not just the Upstream PE) in the
   partition, because they may have specific (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join states
   that this PEy is not aware of, while there is no corresponding
   (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D and Leaf A-D routes.

   For a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join state that a PEy has received from its CEs
   in a VRF, if there is no corresponding (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D
   route from its Upstream PE in the VRF, PEy maintains a corresponding
   forwarding state in the VRF, with the provider tunnel leaves being

   the originators of the (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route and all
   relevant Leaf-A-D routes (same as the above Sender Only Branch case).
   The relevant Leaf A-D routes are the routes whose Route Key field
   contains the same information as the MCAST-VPN NLRI of the (C-*,
   C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route originated by the Upstream PE.  If there is
   no (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route from its Upstream PE either, then
   the provider tunnel has an empty set of leaves and PEy does not
   forward relevant traffic across the provider network.
