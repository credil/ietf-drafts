Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8            November 2012


1.  Introduction

   This specification forms part of the Email Address
   Internationalization protocols described in the Email Address
   Internationalization Framework document [RFC6530].  It extends
   IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] to permit UTF-8 [RFC3629] in headers as described
   in "Internationalized Email Headers" [RFC6532].  It also adds a
   mechanism to support mailbox names using the UTF-8 charset.  This
   specification creates two new IMAP capabilities to allow servers to
   advertise these new extensions.

   This specification assumes that the IMAP server will be operating in
   a fully internationalized environment, i.e., one in which all clients
   accessing the server will be able to accept non-ASCII message header
   fields and other information as specified in Section 3.  At least
   during a transition period, that assumption will not be realistic for
   many environments; the issues involved are discussed in Section 7
   below.

   This specification replaces an earlier, experimental, approach to the
   same problem [RFC5738].

2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
   use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

   The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation.  In addition, rules from IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501],
   UTF-8 [RFC3629], "Collected Extensions to IMAP4 ABNF" [RFC4466], and
   IMAP4 LIST Command Extensions [RFC5258] are also referenced.  This
   document assumes that the reader will have a reasonably good
   understanding of the RFCs above.

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server, respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

3.  UTF8=ACCEPT IMAP Capability and UTF-8 in IMAP Quoted Strings

   The "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability indicates that the server supports the
   ability to open mailboxes containing internationalized messages with
   SELECT and EXAMINE, and can provide UTF-8 responses to the LIST and
   LSUB commands.  This capability also affects other IMAP extensions
   that can return mailbox names or their prefixes, such as NAMESPACE

Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8            November 2012


   [RFC2342] and ACL [RFC4314].

   The "UTF8=ONLY" capability described in Section 6 implies the
   "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability.  A server is said to "support UTF8=ACCEPT"
   if it advertises either "UTF8=ACCEPT" or "UTF8=ONLY".

   A client MUST use the "ENABLE" command (defined in [RFC5161]) with
   the "UTF8=ACCEPT" option (defined in Section 4 below) to indicate to
   the server that the client accepts UTF-8 in quoted-strings and
   supports UTF8=ACCEPT extension.  The "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command is
   only valid in the authenticated state.

   The IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] base specification forbids the use of 8-bit
   characters in atoms or quoted strings.  Thus, a UTF-8 string can only
   be sent as a literal.  This can be inconvenient from a coding
   standpoint, and unless the server offers IMAP4 non-synchronizing
   literals [RFC2088], this requires an extra round trip for each UTF-8
   string sent by the client.  When the IMAP server supports
   "UTF8=ACCEPT" it supports UTF-8 in quoted-strings with the following
   syntax:

            quoted        =/ DQUOTE *uQUOTED-CHAR DQUOTE
                   ; QUOTED-CHAR is not modified, as it will affect
                   ; other RFC 3501 ABNF non terminal.

            uQUOTED-CHAR  = QUOTED-CHAR / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

            UTF8-2        =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>

            UTF8-3        =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>

            UTF8-4        =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>

   When this extended quoting mechanism is used by the client, then the
   server MUST reject with a "BAD" response any octet sequences with the
   high bit set that fail to comply with the formal syntax in [RFC3629].
   The IMAP server MUST NOT send UTF-8 in quoted strings to the client
   unless the client has indicated support for that syntax by using the
   "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command.

   If the server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT", the client MAY use extended
   quoted syntax with any IMAP argument that permits a string (including
   astring and nstring).  However, if characters outside the US-ASCII
   repertoire are used in an inappropriate place, the results would be
   the same as if other syntactically valid but semantically invalid
   characters were used.  Specific cases where UTF-8 characters are
   permitted or not permitted are described in the following paragraphs.

Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8            November 2012


   All IMAP servers that support "UTF8=ACCEPT" SHOULD accept UTF-8 in
   mailbox names, and those that also support the "Mailbox International
   Naming Convention" described in RFC 3501, Section 5.1.3, MUST accept
   utf8-quoted mailbox names and convert them to the appropriate
   internal format.  Mailbox names MUST comply with the Net-Unicode
   Definition ([RFC5198], Section 2) with the specific exception that
   they MUST NOT contain control characters (0000-001F, 0080-009F),
   delete (007F), line separator (2028), or paragraph separator (2029).

   Once an IMAP client has enabled UTF-8 support with the "ENABLE
   UTF8=ACCEPT" command, it MUST NOT issue a SEARCH command that
   contains a CHARSET specification.  If an IMAP server receives such a
   SEARCH command in that situation, it SHOULD reject the command with a
   BAD response (due to the conflicting charset labels).

4.  IMAP UTF8 Append Data Extension

   If the server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT", then the server accepts UTF-8
   headers in the APPEND command message argument.  A client that sends
   a message with UTF-8 headers to the server MUST send them using the
   "UTF8" APPEND data extension.  If the server also advertises the
   CATENATE capability (as specified in [RFC4469]), the client can use
   the same data extension to include such a message in a CATENATE
   message part.  The ABNF for the APPEND data extension and CATENATE
   extension follows:

        utf8-literal   = "UTF8" SP "(" literal8 ")"

        literal8   = <Defined in RFC 4466>

        append-data    =/ utf8-literal

        cat-part       =/ utf8-literal

   If an IMAP server supports "UTF8=ACCEPT" and the IMAP client has not
   issued the "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command, the server MUST reject with
   a "NO" response an APPEND command that includes any 8-bit character
   in message header fields.

5.  LOGIN Command and UTF-8

   This specification doesn't extend the IMAP LOGIN command [RFC3501] to
   support UTF-8 usernames and passwords.  Whenever a client needs to
   use UTF-8 username/passwords, it MUST use the IMAP AUTHENTICATE
   command which is already capable of passing UTF-8 user names and
   credentials.

   Although the use of the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command in this way makes

Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8            November 2012


   it syntactically legal to have a UTF-8 user name or password, there
   is no guarantee the user provisioning system used by the IMAP server
   will allow such identities.  This is an implementation decision and
   may depend on what identity system the IMAP server is configured to
   use.

6.  UTF8=ONLY Capability

   The "UTF8=ONLY" capability indicates that the server supports
   "UTF8=ACCEPT" (see Section 4), and also that it requires support for
   UTF-8 from clients.  That means that it will send UTF-8 in quoted
   strings, and it will not accept the older international mailbox name
   convention (modified UTF-7).  Because these are incompatible changes
   to IMAP, explicit server announcement and client confirmation is
   necessary: clients MUST use the "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command before
   using this server.  A server that advertises "UTF8=ONLY" will reject
   with a "NO [CANNOT]" response any command that might require UTF-8
   support and is not preceded by an "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command.

   IMAP clients that find support for a server that announces
   "UTF8=ONLY" problematic are encouraged to at least detect the
   announcement and provide an informative error message to the end-
   user.

   Because the "UTF8=ONLY" server capability includes support for
   "UTF8=ACCEPT", the capability string will include at most one of
   those and never both.  For the client, "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" is always
   used -- never "ENABLE UTF8-ONLY".

7.   Dealing With Legacy Clients

   In most situations, it will be difficult or impossible for the
   implementer or operator of an IMAP (or POP) server to know whether
   all of the clients that might access it, or the associated mail store
   more generally, will be able to support the facilities defined in
   this document.  In almost all cases, servers who conform to this
   specification will have to be prepared to deal with clients that do
   not enable the relevant capabilities.  Unfortunately, there is no
   completely satisfactory way to do so other than for systems that wish
   to receive email that requires SMTPUTF8 capabilities to be sure that
   all components of those systems -- including IMAP and other clients
   selected by users -- are upgraded appropriately.

   Choices available to the server when a message that requires SMTPUTF8
   is encountered and the client doesn't enable UTF-8 capability include
   hiding the problematic message(s), creating in band or out of band
   notifications or error messages, or somehow trying to create a
   variation on the message with the intention of providing useful



Resnick, et al.           Expires May 10, 2013                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8            November 2012


   information to that client about what has occurred.  Such variant
   messages cannot be actual substitutes for the original message: they
   will almost always be impossible to reply to (either at all or
   without loss of information); the new header fields or specialized
   constructs for server-client communication may go beyond the
   requirements of, e.g., RFC 5322; they may consequently confuse some
   legacy mail user agents (including IMAP clients) or otherwise may not
   provide the expected information to users.  There are also tradeoffs
   in constructing variants of the original message between accepting
   complexity and additional computation costs in order to try to
   preserve as much information as possible (for example, in
   [I-D.ietf-eai-popimap-downgrade]) and trying to minimize those costs
   while still providing useful information (for example, in
   [I-D.ietf-eai-simpledowngrade]).

   Implementations that choose to do downgrading SHOULD use one of the
   standardized algorithms, [I-D.ietf-eai-popimap-downgrade] or
   [I-D.ietf-eai-simpledowngrade].  Getting downgrade algorithms right,
   and minimizing the risk of operational problems and harm to the email
   system, is tricky and requires careful engineering.  These two
   algorithms are well understood and carefully designed.

   Because such messages are really variations on the original ones, not
   really "downgraded ones" (although that terminology is often used for
   convenience), they inevitably have relationships to the original ones
   that the IMAP specification [RFC3501] did not anticipate.  This
   brings up two concerns in particular: First, digital signatures
   computed over and intended for the original message will often not be
   applicable to the variant message, and will often fail signature
   verification.  (It will be possible for some digital signatures to be
   verified, if they cover only parts of the original message that are
   not affected in the creation of the variant.)  Second, servers that
   may be accessed by the same user with different clients or methods
   (e.g., POP or webmail systems in addition to IMAP or IMAP clients
   with different capabilities) will need to exert extreme care to be
   sure that UIDVALIDITY behaves as the user would expect.  Those issues
   may be especially sensitive if the server caches the variant message
   or computes and stores it when the message arrives with the intent of
   making either form available depending on client capabilities.
   Additionally, in order to cope with the case when a server compliant
   with this extension returns the same UIDVALIDITY to both legacy and
   UTF8=ACCEPT-aware clients, a client upgraded from non UTF8=ACCEPT
   aware MUST discard its cache of messages downloaded from the server.

   The best (or "least bad") approach for any given environment will
   depend on local conditions, local assumptions about user behavior,
   the degree of control the server operator has over client usage and
   upgrading, the options that are actually available, and so on.  It is

   impossible, at least at the time of publication of this
   specification, to give good advice that will apply to all situations,
   or even particular profiles of situations, other than "upgrade legacy
   clients as soon as possible".

8.  Issues with UTF-8 Header Mailstore

   When an IMAP server uses a mailbox format that supports UTF-8 headers
   and it permits selection or examination of that mailbox without
   issuing "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" first, it is the responsibility of the
   server to comply with the IMAP4rev1 base specification [RFC3501] and
   [RFC5322] with respect to all header information transmitted over the
   wire.  The issue of handling messages containing non-ASCII characters
   in legacy environments is discussed in Section 7.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document redefines two capabilities ("UTF8=ACCEPT" and
   "UTF8=ONLY") in the IMAP 4 Capabilities registry [RFC3501].  Three
   other capabilities that were described in the experimental
   predecessor to this document (UTF8=ALL, UTF8=APPEND, UTF8=USER) are
   now made OBSOLETE.  IANA is asked to change the IMAP 4 Capabilities
   registry as follows:


    OLD:
      +--------------+---------------------------+
      | UTF8=ACCEPT  |  [RFC5738]                |
      | UTF8=ALL     |  [RFC5738]                |
      | UTF8=APPEND  |  [RFC5738]                |
      | UTF8=ONLY    |  [RFC5738]                |
      | UTF8=USER    |  [RFC5738]                |

      | UTF8=APPEND  |  OBSOLETE (was [RFC5738]) |
      | UTF8=ONLY    |  [[this RFC]]             |
      | UTF8=USER    |  OBSOLETE (was [RFC5738]) |

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of UTF-8 [RFC3629] and SASLprep [RFC4013]
   apply to this specification, particularly with respect to use of
   UTF-8 in user names and passwords.  Otherwise, this is not believed
   to alter the security considerations of IMAP4rev1.

   Special considerations, some of them with security implications,
   occur if a server that conforms to this specification is accessed by
   a client that does not, as well as in some more complex situations in
   which a given message is accessed by multiple clients that might use
   different protocols and/or support different capabilities.  Those
   issues are discussed in Section 7 above.

Appendix A.  Design Rationale

   This non-normative section discusses the reasons behind some of the
   design choices in the above specification.

   The basic approach of advertising the ability to access a mailbox in
   UTF-8 mode is intended to permit graceful upgrade, including servers
   that support multiple mailbox formats.  In particular, it would be
   undesirable to force conversion of an entire server mailstore to
   UTF-8 headers, so being able to phase-in support for new mailboxes
   and gradually migrate old mailboxes is permitted by this design.

   The "UTF8=ONLY" mechanism simplifies diagnosis of interoperability
   problems when legacy support goes away.  In the situation where
   backwards compatibility is broken anyway, just-send-UTF-8 IMAP has
   the advantage that it might work with some legacy clients.  However,
   the difficulty of diagnosing interoperability problems caused by a
   just-send-UTF-8 IMAP mechanism is the reason the "UTF8=ONLY"
   capability mechanism was chosen.
