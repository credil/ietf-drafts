    <abstract>
      <t>Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
      Optimization (ALTO). It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
      Endpoint Cost Service. Future extensions to ALTO may also use Cost
      Metric.</t>

      <t>Different applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics. For
      example, a Resource Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that have low
      latency to the Resource Consumer. However the base ALTO protocol [ALTO]
      has defined only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost"
      metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).</t>

      <t>In this document, we define XXX Cost Metrics, derived from OSPF-TE
      and ISIS-TE, to measure network delay, jitter, packet loss, hop count,
      and bandwidth. The metrics defined in this document provide a relatively
      comprehensive set of Cost Metrics for ALTO focusing on traffic
      engineering. Additional Cost Metrics such as financial cost metrics may
      be defined in other documents.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
      Optimization (ALTO). It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
      Endpoint Cost Service. In particular, applications may benefit from
      knowing network performance measured in several Cost Metrics. For
      example, a more delay sensitive application may focus on latency, and a
      more bandwidth-sensitive application may focus on available
      bandwidth.</t>

      <t>In this document, we define X Cost Metrics, extending the base ALTO
      protocol [ALTO], which has defined only a single Cost Metric, i.e., the
      generic "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification
      [ALTO]).</t>

      <t>The Cost Metrics that we define in this document focus on traffic
      engineering. Additional metrics may be defined in other documents. In
      particular, the Cost Metrics that we define in this document can be
      gathered from routing systems; [OSPF-TE], [ISIS-TE], [BGP-LS] and
      [BGP-PM] define mechanisms that allow an ALTO Server to retrieve and
      derive the necessary information to provide the metrics that we define
      in this document.</t>

      <t>Note that the metrics that the ALTO Server retrieves may be defined
      for only links, and hence, the server will need to compose the link
      metrics to obtain path metrics used in services such as the Cost Map
      Service. In this definition, we define the metrics to be independent of
      link or path, considering that future ALTO extensions may define
      link-based services, and hence the defined metrics should still be
      usable.</t>

      <t>One challenge in defining the metrics is that performance metrics
      often depend on configuration parameters. For example, the value of
      packet loss rate depends on the measurement interval. We handle this
      issue [YRY: IMPORTANT TO SOLVE]</t>

      <t>The definitions of a set Cost Metrics can allow us to extend the base
      protocol (e.g., allowing output and constraints use different Cost
      Metrics), but such extensions are not in the scope of this document.</t>

Cost Metric name:  delay

Metric Description:  To specify spatial and temporal aggregated
          delay over the specified source and destination. The 
          spatial aggregation unit is specified in the query context
          (e.g., PID to PID, or endhost to endhost); and the temporal
          unit is specified as the measurement interval.

Metric Unit:  The unit is microseconds.

Metric Value Type:  
           A single 'JSONNumber' type value containing a non-negative 
           integer component that may be followed by a fraction part 
           and/or an exponent part.

Cost Mode:  A Cost Mode is encoded as a US-ASCII string.
The string MUST either have the value 'numerical' or 'ordinal'.

Measurement details: YRY: SPECIFY MORE DETAILS.

Cost Metric name:  delayjitter

Metric Description:   To specify the average delay variation over 
          a configurable interval for each source/destination pair
          between two endpoints (network locations) in the network.
          It could be either end to end jitter or the jitter 
          associated with a link (linkjitter). The unit is 
          microseconds.

Cost Metric Value type: 
          A single 'JSONumber' type value containing an integer 
          component that may be prefixed with an optional minus
          sign, which may be followed by a fraction part and/or 
          an exponent part.

Purpose: This is intended to be a constraint attribute value
It could be used as a cost metric constraint attribute used 
together with cost metric attribute 'routingcost' or on its
own or as a returned cost metric in the response. 

Cost mode:  A Cost Mode is encoded as a US-ASCII string.  
The string MUST either have the value 'numerical' or 'ordinal'.

Measurement timing: Gather and update at the configurable interval
if it is link attribute. See [OSPF-TE] for configurable
interval. The configurable interval for end to end jitter could
be same as link.

Measurement points with Potential Measurement Domain:
The measurement point could be at any endpoint between
source and destination in the network.

          <abstract>
            <t>In many standards track documents several words are used to
            signify the requirements in the specification. These words are
            often capitalized. This document defines these words as they
            should be interpreted in IETF documents. Authors who follow these
            guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of
            their document: <list>
                <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
                "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
                "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
                in RFC 2119.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Note that the force of these words is modified by the
            requirement level of the document in which they are used.</t>

    <section title="Filtering constraint Extensions">
      <t>Section 10.2.2.3 of "ALTO: Application Layer Traffic Optimization

with members:

cost-type  The CostType (Section 9.7) for the returned costs.  The
cost-metric and cost-mode fields MUST match one of the supported
Cost Types indicated in this resource's capabilities
(Section 10.2.2.4).  The ALTO Client SHOULD omit the description
field, and if present, the ALTO Server MUST ignore the description
field.

constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which
elements of the Cost Map are returned.  This parameter MUST NOT be
specified if this resource's capabilities ( Section 10.2.2.4)
indicate that constraint support is not available.  A constraint
contains two entities separated by whitespace: (1) an operator,
 'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for greater than
or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for equal to;
(2) a target cost value.  The cost value is a number that MUST be
defined in the same units as the Cost Metric indicated by the
cost-metric parameter.  ALTO Servers SHOULD use at least IEEE 754
double-precision floating point [IEEE.754.2008] to store the cost
value, and SHOULD perform internal computations using double-
precision floating-point arithmetic.  If multiple 'constraint'
parameters are specified, they are interpreted as being related to
each other with a logical AND.

      <t>In the JSON Object of type ReqFilteredCostMap, the constraint
      attribute is expressed as:<figure>
          <artwork>
“
[gt | lt | ge | le | eq ] &lt;value&gt;

      <t>In this specification, the constraint attribute is changed to<figure>

   “
&lt;cost-type2&gt;  [gt | lt | ge | le | eq ] &lt;value&gt;
   ”
</artwork>

constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which

contains three entities separated by whitespace: (1)an cost type
is by default cost-type in the JSON Object of type ReqFilteredCostMap.
In addition, it could be another cost-type used for the returned cost 
(2) an operator, 'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for
greater than or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for
