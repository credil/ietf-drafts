Internet-Draft     Candidate Address Selection for ICE        March 2012


1.  Introduction

   When Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245]
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-tcp] is used for NAT traversal, both endpoints
   gather multiple IP addresses and ports, also called candidate
   addresses, and test for connectivity between them.  One of the
   principles of ICE is to gather all possible candidate addresses and
   pair them with all the addresses of the peer in order to test all
   combinations and get high probability for successful NAT traversal.

   A prioritization formula is used by ICE so that most preferred
   address pairs are tested first, and if a sufficiently good pair is
   discovered, the tests can be stopped.  Addresses obtained from local
   network interfaces, called host candidates, are recommended as high-
   priority ones to be tested first since if they work, they provide
   usually the best path between the two hosts.  With IPv4 this approach
   works well since interfaces usually have just a single unicast IP
   address.  However, with IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291]
   interfaces commonly have multiple addresses: global, link-local,
   Unique Local (ULA) [RFC4193], etc.

   The ICE specification recommends to use the rules defined in
   [RFC3484] as part of the prioritization formula for IPv6 candidates,
   but does not give much further advice on how to handle different kind
   of IPv6 addresses.  However, if all different kind of IPv6 addresses
   are paired with each other, some of the combinations will never work
   and may unnecessarily delay the completion of the ICE process.

   This document updates the ICE rules defined in [RFC5245] and
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-tcp] on how candidate addresses are selected and
   how they should be combined with each other in order to maintain high
   performance for the ICE NAT traversal process.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the same terminology as ICE (see Section 3 of
   [RFC5245]).


3.  Changes to Candidate Address Selection

   This document proposes the following updates to the rules for

   selecting and combining IPv6 candidate addresses:

   o  Instead of RFC 3484 rules, the rules defined in
      [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise] MUST be used for determining the
      candidate priorities.

   o  Deprecated IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses [RFC4291] and IPv6 site-
      local unicast addresses [RFC3879] MUST NOT be included in the
      address candidates.

   o  Candidate addresses from link-local addresses MUST NOT be combined
      with any other candidates except other link-local candidates.

   o  Candidate addresses from Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) MUST NOT be
      combined with any other candidates except other ULA candidates.

   o  IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses MUST NOT be included in the offered
      candidates unless the application using ICE does not support IPv4
      (i.e., is an IPv6-only application [RFC4038]).

   The following updates pertain to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:

   o  Addresses from a loopback interface MUST NOT be included in the
      candidate addresses.

   o  Local relayed candidates MUST NOT be combined with remote host
      candidates from IPv4 private address space [RFC1918] or IPv6 link-
      local addresses or ULAs.


4.  Negotiating Address Selection Scheme

   The prioritization method for the candidate address pairs used by ICE
   results in matching checklists for both endpoints and hence both
   endpoints start the checks for the same candidate pair roughly at the
   same time.  This is important since in many scenarios a connectivity
   check initiated by both endpoints for the same pair is needed before
   a check for the pair succeeds.  Also, some NAT devices have very
   short timeouts for their address translation bindings and a binding
   created by a connectivity check from one endpoint may expire before
   the corresponding connectivity check from the other endpoint is sent
   if there is a long delay between the two checks.

   Depending on how different candidates are paired and whether RFC 3484
   or the revised version of it [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise] is used,
   the endpoints may end up with different priorities and checklists.
   Therefore, the endpoints need to agree on how the address selection
   and pairing is done.

   To indicate that the address selection and pairing rules defined in
   this document are used, the ICE offerer MUST include ice-options
   attribute with "rfcXXXX-candidates" [RFC Editor: replace XXXX with
   the RFC number for this specification upon publication] option
   identifier in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] ICE
   offer.  If the ICE offer does not include this option tag, the
   answerer SHOULD NOT utilize the updated rules defined in this
   document.  If the offer included the option tag and the answerer
   supports this specification, the answerer SHOULD add the same option
   tag to the response and use the updated rules.  If the ICE answer
   does not contain the option tag, the offerer SHOULD NOT use the
   updated rules.


5.  Security Considerations

   The general security considerations for ICE have been documented in
   Section 18 of [RFC5245] and Section 12 of [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-tcp].
   The general security considerations for IPv6 address selection rules
   have been documented in [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise].  The
   vulnerabilities in ICE and RFC3484bis relate to attempts to hijack
   sessions opened through ICE, denial-of-service attacks, and
   accidental disclosure of private information.  Mechanisms described
   in [RFC5245] and [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-tcp] - such as validated TCP
   connections - are designed to protect against connection hijacking.

   Denial-of-service attacks can not be completely eliminated, but the
   amplification capabilities of ICE are limited through a maximum value
   of concurrently probed connections.

   Any address probing mechanism opens up the possibility of outsiders
   learning the correlation between different IP addresses.  For
   instance, the existence of a privacy address [RFC4941] in the
   candidate set along with other, more stable addresses will tell at
   least the peer and maybe eavesdroppers that the addresses are
   related.

   This specification introduces no specific new security concerns
   beyond these, as it only attempts to unify the algorithms associated
   with candidate address pair selection.  However, where address
   selection rules in a node are configured through an external
   mechanism, as suggested in [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise], this opens
   up another avenue for introducing incorrect addresses into the
   probing mechanism.  The resulting system is only as secure as its
   weakest component.  For instance, even if sufficient security
   mechanisms are in place in ICE, vulnerabilities in the configuration
   mechanisms for the 3484bis priority tables may introduce weaknesses
   in the ability of ICE to select the right addresses.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register "rfcXXXX-candidates" option identifier
   under the "ICE Options" [RFC6336] registry.  The required
   registration information TBD.
