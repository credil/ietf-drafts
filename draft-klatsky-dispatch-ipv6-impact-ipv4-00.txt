             Interoperability Impacts of IPv6 Interworking
                 with Existing IPv4 SIP Implementations
               draft-klatsky-dispatch-ipv6-impact-ipv4-00

Abstract

   This document captures potential impacts to IPv4 SIP implementations
   when interworking with IPv6 SIP implementations.  Although some
   amount of interworking translation will occur at the network and
   application layers, an IPv4 SIP application may still encounter a SIP
   message with some IPv6 values in it, resulting in unforeseen error
   conditions.  Such potential scenarios will be identified in this
   document so that SIP application developers can define solutions to
   handle these cases.  Note, this document is not intended to be an
   exhaustive list, rather to provide an overview of some of the more
   commonly encountered potential scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   The continued proliferation of IPv6 infrastructure deployments has
   resulted in more IPv6 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents
   (UAs) being turned up on the network.  Considering the large deployed
   install base of IPv4 SIP UAs developed prior to the widespread
   deployment of IPv6, it is a well known fact that not all IPv4 SIP UAs
   have taken into account all possible IPv4 SIP-to-IPv6 SIP
   interoperability considerations at the time of their development.

Internet-Draft      IPv4/IPv6 Interoperability in SIP          June 2013


   The scenarios outlined in this document are intended as guidance for
   application developers to help identify solutions to resolve the
   identified interoperability challenges.  The scenarios detailed in
   this document are not meant to be exhaustive, and more scenarios may
   be identified in the future.

2.  Terminology and Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   RFC 3261 [RFC3261] defines additional terms used in this document
   that are specific to the SIP domain such as "proxy"; "registrar";
   "redirect server"; "user agent server" or "UAS"; "user agent client"
   or "UAC"; "back-to-back user agent" or "B2BUA"; "dialog";
   "transaction"; "server transaction".

   This document uses the term "SIP Server" that is defined to include
   the following SIP entities: user agent server, registrar, redirect
   server, a SIP proxy in the role of user agent server, and a B2BUA in
   the role of a user agent server.

   This document also uses the following terminology to make clear
   distinction between SIP entities supporting only IPv4, only IPv6 or
   supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.

   IPv4-only UA/UAC/UAS:  An IPv4-only UA/UAC/UAS supports SIP signaling
      and media only on the IPv4 network.  It does not understand IPv6
      addresses.

   IPv6-only UA/UAC/UAS:  An IPv6-only UA/UAC/UAS supports SIP signaling
      and media only on the IPv6 network.  It does not understand IPv4
      addresses.

   IPv4/IPv6 UA/UAC/UAS:  A UA/UAC/UAS that supports SIP signaling and
      media on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks; such a UA/UAC/UAS is known
      (and will be referred to in this document) as a "dual-stack"
      [RFC4213] UA/UAC/UAS.

3.  Potential IPv4/IPv6 Interoperability Failure Scenarios

3.1.  IPv6 Address Handling in Via Headers

   As an IPv6 SIP message makes its way through the network, the Via
   header is updated and includes specific IPv6 addresses of IPv6 nodes
   that it has traversed.  If the message arrives at an IPv4-only UAS it
   may still contain those IPv6 addresses in the Via header.  Presumably

Internet-Draft      IPv4/IPv6 Interoperability in SIP          June 2013


   the topmost Via header references an IPv4 address or a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) resolvable to any IPv4 address.  In this
   case the IPv4-only UAS is able to send its response on to its next
   hop, otherwise the message would not have made it to the IPv4-only UA
   at all.  The challenge for the IPv4-only UA then becomes to not
   generate an error even if the other Via headers that it does not need
   to act upon contain IPv6 addresses.

3.2.  IPv6 Address Handling in Record-Route and Route Headers

   Similar to the concerns of having IPv6 addresses in the Via headers,
   IPv4 SIP UAS may also encounter Record-Route headers that contain
   IPv6 addresses of IPv6 nodes the SIP message has traversed.  It is
   again assumed that if the SIP message arrives at an IPv4-only UA that
   the topmost Record-Route header references an IPv4 address or a FQDN
   resolvable to any IPv4 address, such that the response may be routed
   back to a node reachable by the IPv4-only UAS.  In this instance the
   IPv4-only UA should not generate an error when parsing the IPv6
   addresses.  Additionally, the IPv4-only UA may also need to populate
   the Route header in the response that includes the IPv6 addresses
   learned from previously received Record-Route header, and again do so
   without generating an error.

3.3.  IPv6 Address Handling in Contact Headers

   Another scenario with possible IPv6-to-IPv4 interoperability
   implications is the case where the IPv4-only UAS receives an IPv6
   address in the Contact header.  Since this represents the peer's
   reachable contact IP, it may not have been modified by any
   interworking element in the communications path.  The IPv4-only UAS
   will have to send its requests through its outbound SIP server, and
   not generate an error upon receipt of a message with this IPv6
   information.

3.4.  IPv6 Address Handling in SDP Body

   IPv4-only UASes may also receive INVITEs with IPv6 addresses in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] portion of the message.
   An IPv6 address can appear in multiple places in the SDP, such as the
   o= line, c= line or a= lines (for Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] attributes).  A working assumption is
   that minimally the c= line will reference an IPv4 address of a media
   interworking element to allow the media communications being
   established by this session to work.  Nonetheless the IPv4-only UAS
   needs be aware and properly handle any IPv6 addresses that may be
   within the received SDP.

3.5.  IPv6 Address Handling in 'reginfo' XML Registration Information
      Document

   There may be instances where an IPv4-only UAC subscribes to the
   registration event package [RFC3680] as a "watcher" for a specific
   entity, to be informed of registration state changes for that entity.
   The "watcher" may have no knowledge of the IP address family in use
   on the "watched" entity, and it is possible that a NOTIFY indicating
   an IPv6 address in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) [XML] body is
   received.  The "watcher" needs to properly parse such a NOTIFY and
   provide the status update of the "watched" entity to the user or
   system that requested the information.

3.6.  IPv6 Address Handling in 30x Redirect

   There may be scenarios where an IPv4-only UAC receives a 30x redirect
   message in response to a request it has sent.  This 30x message may
   contain a Contact header with an IPv6 address.  This is the case
   where the call is being redirected to an IPv6-only UAS.  Since this
   represents the peer's reachable contact IP, it may not have been
   modified by any interworking element in the communications path.  The
   IPv4-only UAC should send its new request to its outbound SIP server
   without generating an error upon receipt of a 30x message with IPv6
   information.

3.7.  IPv6 Address Handling in REFER-based Transfer

   After establishing a call between two IPv4-only UAs, one of the
   parties in the call may attempt to transfer the other party to a 3rd
   party using the REFER method [RFC5589].  This transfer may be to an
   IPv6-only UAS.  The implication is that both IPv4-only UASes involved
   in the call transfer need to be able to handle a REFER with an IPv6
   address in the Refer-To header.  The transferor needs to be able to
   form the proper REFER message with the IPv6 Contact and the
   transferee needs to be able to process the REFER message and attempt
   to establish a call with the transfer target.

3.8.  DNS Resolution of IPv4/IPv6 in SRV Records

   A dual-stack UA may use the Domain Name System (DNS) SRV mechanism to
   resolve addresses of proxies that it needs to communicate with.  In
   such a case it needs to be able to locate both IPv4 proxies and IPv6
   proxies.  This implies that the DNS server has been updated with both
   A and AAAA records for the SIP server, and that the dual-stack UA
   requests for both IPv4 and IPv6 SIP server addresses.

3.9.  IPv6 Address Handling in Multiple Contact Registrations

Internet-Draft      IPv4/IPv6 Interoperability in SIP          June 2013


   A 200 OK to a REGISTER request might include multiple Contact headers
   because the user has registered his or her Address of Record (AOR) on
   multiple clients.  Some of these Contact headers might have IPv6
   addresses.  An IPv4-only UAC must be able to handle the IPv6
   information properly.

3.10.  Unsupported Address

   If the endpoint is an IPv4-only or an IPv6-only endpoint, and it
   receives a request with an SDP offer that has a network address that
   is not compatible with the network address it supports, the endpoint
   should decline the request by returning a 488 "Not Acceptable Here"
   (as defined in section 13.3.1.2 of RFC3261) with a Warning header
   that has a warning code or 301 "Incompatible Network Address Formats"
   (as defined in section 20.43 of RFC3261).

4.  Security Considerations

   This document merely describes the potential impacts of IPv6 on IPv4
   SIP implementations.  The scenarios discussed in this informational
   document do not introduce any new security threats.  The specific
   security vulnerabilities, attacks, threat models of the various
   protocols discussed in this document (SIP, SDP, ICE, etc.) are well
   documented in their respective documents.
