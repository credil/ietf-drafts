                    draft-zheng-sdn-discovery-00.txt

Abstract

   In SDN networks, applications need to discover the location of the
   local or specific SDN Orchestrator before requesting service.  Other
   SDN Orchestrator may also need to know its nearby SDN Orchestrators.
   This is called SDN Discovery.  This document introduces a discovery
   scheme which employs the U-NAPTR mechanism to determine the URI of
   the SDN Orchestrator.

1.  Introduction

   Modern applications require the ability to efficently interact and
   manipulate resources provisioned and controlled by networks.
   Software Driven Networks (SDN) is an approach to networks that
   enables applications to manipulate the network devices and resources.
   Applications can benefit from knowing the available resources and
   from requesting that the network makes the resources available in
   specific ways.

   Applications need to know the location of the local or specific SDN
   Orchestrator before requesting service, other SDN Orchestrator may
   also need to know its nearby SDN Orchestrators.  In the real world,
   the applications/SDN Orchestrators might not know where the SDN
   Orchestrator is in the network, the location/address of SDN
   Orchestrator may change time to time.  The locationo of SDN
   Orchestrator could be either manually configured or dynamically
   discovered.  This document introduces a discovery scheme which
   employs the U-NAPTR mechanism to determine the URI of the SDN
   Orchestrator.  We call both Application or SDN Orchestrator who
   requesting the discovery service as Discovery Client in this
   document.

   As defined by this document, by querying the SDN Discovery Server,
   Discovery Client discover and retrieve HTTP(S) URI of the SDN
   Orchestrator Directory.  The SDN Orchestrator Directory indicates the
   location/address of SDN Orchestrator, and gives the further
   information about the capabilities and services provided by that SDN
   Orchestrator.  An SDN Orchestrator MUST make an SDN Orchestrator
   Directory available via the HTTP GET method to a URI discoverable by
   Discovery Client.

2.  Discovery Scenario

2.1.  SDN Model

   Managing a SDN network involves interactions among different
   functions and components within the network.  The SDN model is shown
   in Figure 1.  Among these interfaces/interactions, SDN Orchestratort-
   to-location services Interface allows the SDN Orchestrator to
   interconnect with location services.  This allow the SDN Orchestrator
   to register itself as a local Orchestrator, and allow other
   Orchestrators and applications to find it.

3.  SDN Orchestrator Directory

   A SDN Orchestrator Directory indicates to Discovery Clients the
   location/address of SDN Orchestrator, and gives the further
   information about the capabilities and services provided by that SDN
   Orchestrator.  The format of the SDN Orchestrator Directory need to
   be carefully designed for scalibility, the services provided by SDN
   Orchestrator need to be well named and classified.  Further study is
   centainly required on this.  An SDN Orchestrator MUST make an SDN
   Orchestrator Directory available via the HTTP GET method to a URI
   discoverable by Discovery Client.

4.  Protocol Overview

   This document introduce the U-NAPTR based resolution process to
   retrieve the SDN Orchestrator URL.  To discover available SDN
   Orchestrator, a Discovery Client need to send an U-NAPTR request to
   SDN Discovery Sever, to retrieve the HTTP(S) URI of the SDN
   Orchestrator Directory.  Instead of using the SDN Orchestrator
   discovery mechnism introduced in this document, applications MAY also
   use own methods to discover an SDN Orchestrator which is outside the
   scope of this document.

4.1.  Retrieving the Domain Name

   The U-NAPTR process needs the right domain name as input (Application
   Unique String).  When Discovery Client need to discover its local SDN
   Orchestrator, the domain name could be determined by the IP address
   of the Discovery Client and the DNS suffix of the access network
   where the Discovery Client is registered in.  In the case of
   discovering the specific SDN Orchestrators, e.g.  SDN Orchestrators
   belong to specific service provider, the domain name could be a
   specific well-known domain name.

   In order to retrieve the DNS suffix, three different options could be
   applied.  The DNS suffix could be determined by user input, DHCP or
   reverse DNS, in descending order of preference.  A Discovery Client
   MAY try other methods in case the first U-NAPTR lookup failed.  The
   details of DNS suffix retrieving by these three different options
   will be elaborated in future version of the document.

4.2.  U-NAPTR Resolution

   The first step of the SDN Discovery procedure (see Section 4.1)
   yielded an U-NAPTR/DDDS [RFC4848] [RFC4848]application unique
   strings, in the form of a DNS name.  An example is "localsdn.com".
   In this second step, the SDN Discovery procedure needs to use the
   U-NAPTR [RFC4848] [RFC4848]specification described below to obtain a
   URI for the SDN Orchestrator Directory.  In this document, only the
   HTTP and HTTPS URL schemes are defined.

   The following two DNS entries show the U-NAPTR resolution for
   "localsdn.com" to the HTTPS URL
   https://sdnorchestrator.localsdn.com/secure/directory or the HTTP URL
   http://sdnorchestrator.localsdn.com/directory, with the former being
   preferred.

   localsdn.com.

   IN NAPTR 200 10 "u" "SDN:http"
   "!.*!http://sdnorchestrator.localsdn.com/directory!"  ""

   There is a potential that the U-NAPTR lookup does not yield to a
   result, i.e. no SDN NAPTR record is found.  In this case the
   discovery procedure failed for this application unique string.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the Discovery Client wait a period of time before
   repeating the procedure.  Discovery Clients MAY repeat the discovery
   procedure for a different application unique string instantaneously.
