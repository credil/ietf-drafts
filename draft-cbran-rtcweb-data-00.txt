1.  Introduction

   This specification will focus on the transport of real-time non-media
   data requirements for RTC-Web client applications.  An example of
   real-time non-media data, would be a characters screen position
   within an multiplayer HTML5 video game.

   The non-media data transport requirements fit into a series of
   specifications have been created to address RTC-Web negotiation and
   signaling protocols, security requirements, media transmission and
   use cases.  More information on the RTC-Web can be found here:

   [TODO put links to supporting drafts here]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Non-Media Data Transport Requirements

   The RTC-WEB will enable for rich voice and video communications from
   client applications, such as a web browser.  One of the natural
   extensions of the RTC-WEB and the work emerging from the HTML5
   community is video games.  Video games have a similar stringent real-
   time requirement for exchanging non-media data types such as a
   player's screen position.

   The question of how best to handle non-media data types has been
   raised.  There have been proposals to address this problem.  Common
   to all proposals is how the data transport session is set up, using
   ICE [RFC5245] in a similar manner to that of RTP [RFC3550].  The
   proposals vary from once the session is set up; one proposal is just
   to use a thin shim on top of UDP or DTLS to de-multiplex the packets
   from other packets such as RTP on the same connection.  Another
   proposal is DTLS over DCCP over UDP with some appropriate congestion
   control scheme chosen for DCCP.  Lastly there has been a proposal to
   define a data codec to carry the data in RTP.

   Of all the solutions proposed to date there have been issues with
   implementation maturity and availability, congestion control, high
   overhead and NAT traversal.  The solution outlined within this
   specification proposes a lightweight, simple to implement approach
   for RTC-Web client applications to transmit real-time non-media data.

4.  Solution Overview

   Each application datagram is send with a single byte header to help
   with de-multiplexing issues.  The combined datagraph and header are
   sent either over UDP or DTLS to the receiver.  The receiver sends an
   acknowledgment for every packet it receives.  The sender computes a
   packet loss rate based upon the number of packets sent, and number of
   acknowledgements it has received inside of given time window.  The
   browser, or other RTC-Web client application implementation, then
   enforces a maximum bandwidth usage using the TFRC-SP[RFC4828].

   Practically this can be implemented with a simple lookup table such
   as Table 1 in [RFC4828] that limits the data rate.  A JavaScript
   application running in the browser can implement more complex
   fragmentation, reliability, and congestion control algorithms, but it
   is the browser, or other RTC-Web client application, that is
   responsible for enforcing the basic congestion safety with the
   TFRC-SP algorithm.


5.  Specification

   When sending a datagram, a single byte with the value 62 MUST be
   prepended to the data to be sent.  The data is then sent over the UDP
   or a DTLS flow that has been set up by ICE.  The receiver MUST send
   an acknowledgement for each packets it receives.  This acknowledgment
   is a UDP or DTLS datagram containing a single byte with the value of
   63.  The packet loss rate is computed by comparing the number of
   packet sent to the of acknowledgements received within the past 2
   seconds.  The packet loss rate and amount of data sent is used with
   the TFRC-SP algorithm to compute a maximum safe bandwidth.  The
   sender MUST not exceed this bandwidth.  If an application requests
   the browser, or other RTC-Web client application, to send a packet
   that would exceed the bandwidth, the RTC-Web client application MUST
   signal an error to the requesting application and drop the packet.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   RFC.


7.  Security Considerations

   requirements for RTC-WEB client applications there is a draft that
   specifically addresses the RTC-WEB application security
   considerations.  This draft defers it's security considerations and
   requirements to the security considerations for RTC-Web draft
