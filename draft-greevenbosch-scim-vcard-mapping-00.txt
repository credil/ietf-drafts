Abstract

   This document defines a mapping between Simple Cloud Identity
   Management (SCIM) and vCard.  It can be used for conversion between
   the different schemes, or as guidance to select one of them.

Internet-Draft             SCIM/vCard mapping             September 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) core schema
   [I-D.scim-core-schema] defines a platform neutral data and extension
   model for representing users of cloud services.  SCIM core also
   defines XML and JSON serialisations of the abstract schema.

   This document defines a mapping between SCIM and vCard [RFC6350].
   The mapping may serve several purposes:

   o  To provide a unified conversion mechanism between SCIM and vCard.

   o  To identify properties that are defined in vCard, but are missing
      in SCIM.

   o  To identify SCIM attributes that may be useful in vCard too.

   o  To serve as guidance to consider whether vCard can be used as a
      basis for SCIM.

   o  To provide discussion material on whether vCard could replace the
      SCIM schema completely.

   The SCIM WG is recommended to consider these issues.

3.  Mapping from SCIM attributes to vCard properties

   Table 1 describes a mapping from SCIM attributes to the vCard
   properties.

   The reverse mapping from vCard to SCIM is defined in Section 4.  The
   reason for having two tables is that some mappings are not
   invertible.

5.  Open issues

   The following is a list of open issues:

   o  Mapping between SCIM IDs and vCard UIDs.

   o  Text in [I-D.scim-core-schema] defines only plural "emails",
      "phoneNumbers", "ims", "photos", "addresses", "groups",
      "entitlements" and "roles" elements.  However, the XML examples
      show that these plural element contain the associated singular
      elements.  This is not the case for the JSON representation.

7.  Security Considerations

   The mapping between vCard and SCIM may be useful for easily
   transferring data for one system towards another.  However, it also
   has privacy implications.  Therefore, it is important that user
   consensus is acquired where applicable.

   For this document, some decisions were made concerning mapping
   between attributes and properties with similar, but not equal,
   semantics.  This was done in a best effort manner.  However one
   should realise that during the mapping process some accuracy from the
   original data may be lost.
