Abstract

   This document specifies the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication P-header
   used by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  The use of
   this private network indication extension is only applicable inside
   an administrative domain with previously agreed-upon policies for
   generation, transport and usage of such information.  A private
   network indication allows nodes in such a domain to treat private
   network traffic according to a different set of rules than the set
   applicable to public network traffic.  The indication also
   distinguishes traffic from one private network from another private
   network.

Internet-Draft         private network indication              July 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   ETSI TISPAN defined Next Generation Networks (NGN) which uses the
   3rd-Generqation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia
   Subsystem) which in turn uses SIP (RFC3261 [RFC3261]) as its main
   signaling protocol.  (For more information on the IMS, a detailed
   description can be found in 3GPP TS 23.228 [3GPP.23.228] and 3GPP TS
   24.229 [3GPP.24.229].) 3GPP and ETSI TISPAN have identified a set of
   requirements that can be met by defining a new optional SIP header,
   according to the procedures in RFC 5727 [RFC5727].

1.2.  Applicability

   According to RFC 3427 [RFC3427], P-headers have a limited
   applicability.  Specifications of P-headers such as this RFC need to
   clearly document the useful scope of the proposal, and explain its
   limitations and why it is not suitable for the general use of SIP on
   the Internet.

   The P-Private-Network-Indication header field is intended to be used
   in controlled closed networks like 3GPP IMS and ETSI TISPAN NGN
   networks.  The P-Private-Network-Indication header is not intended
   for the general internet environment and is probably not suitable for
   such an environment.

1.3.  Backgrounds

   The P-Private-Network-Indication header field has been referred by
   3GPP IMS specifications and has already been used in some networks as
   an indicator for a specific capability.  The header field has been
   already implemented in some vendors' equipment in some countries.
   RFC 5727 [RFC5727] prohibits the new proposal of P-header "unless
   existing deployments or standards use the prefix already."  The
   P-Private-Network-Indication header field is already used by existing
   deployments and 3GPP standards, therefore, this is exactly the case
   where the P-header is allowed as an exception.

1.4.  Business communication

   ETSI TISPAN has identified a framework [ETSI.181.019] for the support
   of business communication capabilities by the NGN.  As well as the
   direct attachment of Next Generation Corporate Network (NGCN)
   equipment, this includes the capability to "host" functionality
   relating to an enterprise within the NGN itself.

   These hosting arrangements are:

Internet-Draft         private network indication              July 2013


   a)  virtual leased line, where NGCN sites are interconnected through
       the NGN;

   b)  business trunking application, where the NGN hosts transit
       capabilities between NGCN's, break-in capabilities where the NGN
       converts public network traffic to private network traffic for
       delivery at a served NGCN and break-out capabilities where the
       NGN converts private network traffic from a served NGCN to public
       network traffic; and

   c)  hosted enterprise services, where an NGN hosts originating and/or
       terminating business communication capabilities for business
       communication users that are directly attached to an NGN.

   ETSI TISPAN has requirements that can be met by the introduction of
   an explicit indication for private network traffic.

   The traffic generated or received by a public NGN on behalf of a
   private network can be either:

   o  public network traffic: traffic sent to or received from an NGN
      for processing according to the rules for ordinary subscribers of
      a public telecommunication network.  This type of traffic is known
      as public network traffic;

   o  private network traffic: traffic sent to the NGN for processing
      according to an agreed set of rules specific to an enterprise.
      This type of traffic is known as private network traffic.  Private
      network traffic is normally exchanged within a single enterprise,
      but private network traffic can also be exchanged between two or
      more different enterprises, based on some prior arrangements, if
      not precluded for regulatory reasons.

1.5.  Indication types

   A private network indication as proposed by this document is an
   indication to network element (supporting this specification)
   traversed that this is a private network traffic as opposed to a
   public network traffic.  This indication does not identify an end
   user on a private network and is not for delivery to an end user on
   the private network.  It is an indication that special service
   arrangements apply (if such service is configured based on private
   network traffic) for an enterprise, and therefore it is an indication
   of service on behalf to an enterprise, not an indication of service
   to a private network's end user.

   In order to allow NGN IMS nodes to perform different processing, ETSI
   TISPAN formulated the following requirements on NGN:

Internet-Draft         private network indication              July 2013


   1.  The NGN shall distinguish public network traffic from private
       network traffic.

   2.  The NGN shall distinguish private network traffic belonging to
       one enterprise from that belonging to another enterprise.

   To summarize a few example reasons for a public NGN to make the
   distinction between the two types of traffic:

   o  Different regulations apply to two types of traffic, most notably
      lawful intercept requirements.  Another example is that emergency
      calls may be handled differently depending on the type of traffic.

   o  Different charging regimes may apply.

   o  Call recording for business reasons (e.g. quality control,
      training, non-repudiation) might apply only to a specific type of
      traffic.

   o  Different levels of signaling and/or media transparency may apply
      to the different types of traffic.

   There are several reasons why there is a need for an explicit
   indication in the signaling:

   1.  As caller and callee addresses can not always be used to
       determine whether a certain call is to be treated as private or
       public network traffic.

   2.  Different nodes spanning over different network may need to be
       able to act differently on type of traffic, when implicit schemes
       is used, it would require distribution of such enterprise
       specific logic over multiple nodes in multiple operators.  That
       is clearly not a manageable architecture and solution.

   3.  There may be cases where treating the call as a public network
       call although both participants are from the same enterprise is
       advantageous to the enterprise.

   Given the above background this document will formulate requirements
   for SIP to support an explicit private network indication.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119

   [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

3.1.  Traffic

   In the context of this document the term traffic is understood as all
   communication pertaining to and/or controlled by a SIP transaction or
   dialog.

3.2.  Public network traffic

   Traffic sent to or received from a public telecommunication network
   for processing according to the rules for ordinary subscribers of a
   public telecommunication network.

3.3.  Private network traffic

   Traffic sent to or received from a public telecommunication network
   for processing according to an agreed set of rules specific to an
   enterprise or a community of closely related enterprises.

3.4.  Trust domain

   The term Trust Domain in this document is taken from RFC3324
   [RFC3324].  A trust domain applies to the private network indication.
   The rules for specifying such a trust domain are specified in RFC3324
   [RFC3324] which require the filling out a Spec (T).

   The Spec (T) need not specify the same contents and trust domain
   boundaries that are used for other header fields like for example the
   P-Asserted-Identity.


4.  Application of terminology

   Figure 1 shows the interconnection of sites belonging to two private
   networks using the public network.  Traffic in the public network
   relating to the interconnection of the two sites of enterprise 1 are
   tagged as private network traffic relating to enterprise 1.  In
   certain cases an enterprise can also choose to send traffic from one
   enterprise site to another enterprise site as public network traffic
   when this is beneficial to the enterprise.  Traffic in the public
   network relating to the interconnection of the two sites of
   enterprise 2 are tagged as private network traffic relating to
   enterprise 2.  Enterprise 1 also generates traffic to public phones
   and this is public network traffic (untagged in the public network).

Internet-Draft         private network indication              July 2013


   There may be circumstances where traffic between two different
   enterprises are tagged as private network traffic relating to the
   common domain that is pre-agreed between the two enterprises.

   Figure 2 shows the interconnection of sites belonging to a private
   network using the public network, and supported in the public network
   by a server providing a business trunking application.  The business
   trunking application provides routing capabilities for the enterprise
   traffic, and supports the identification of calls to and from public
   network users, break-in and break out of that traffic.  (Note that
   the business trunking application may consist of a concatenation of
   application logic provided to the originating enterprise site and
   application logic that is provided to the terminating enterprise
   site.)  Traffic in the public network relating to the interconnection
   of the two sites of enterprise 1 are tagged as private network

   Figure 3 shows the interconnection of sites belonging to a private
   network on a server providing a hosted enterprise service application
   (also known as Centrex).  The hosted enterprise service application
   supports phones belonging to the enterprise and is also able to route
   traffic to and from public network phones using break-in or break-out
   functionality.  Traffic in the public network relating to the
   interconnection of the site of enterprise 1 and the hosted enterprise
   service belonging to enterprise 1 are tagged as private network
   traffic relating to enterprise 1.  The hosted enterprise service
   application also routes traffic to public phones and this is public
   network traffic (untagged in the public network).  Traffic from the
   enterprise phones would not normally be tagged (such tag is added at
   the server providing the hosted enterprise services application.
   (Note that the hosted enterprise service logic may precede or succeed
   a business trunking application that offers services on behalf of an
   enterprise site.)

5.  Requirements

   This section lists the requirements on SIP derived from the
   considerations in Section 1:

   R1:  It is REQUIRED that an indication can be sent in SIP initial
        requests for a dialog or SIP standalone requests that indicates
        that the request or associated session is to be treated
        according to the rules of private network traffic.

   R2:  The indication from R1 can be inserted by a SIP proxy belonging
        to an administrative domain for onward routing and for the
        traffic within that administrative domain, that needs to be so
        distinguished.  The indication is not needed where the traffic
        is assumed to be all public, or where the traffic is assumed to
        be all private (contained within the closed network, not
        crossing any public network).

Internet-Draft         private network indication              July 2013


   R3:  The indication from R1 can be removed by a SIP proxy belonging
        to an administrative domain for onward routing where the traffic
        no longer needs to be so distinguished.  An example exists where
        the traffic reaches an NGCN site where the traffic is assumed to
        be all private network traffic.  Another example is on the final
        hop to the UA.

   R4:  It is REQUIRED that the indication from R1 allows entities to
        determine the set of rules that are applicable, these rules may
        be enterprise specific.

   R5:  It is REQUIRED that the indication from R1 allows entities
        receiving it to distinguish private network traffic from
        different enterprises.

   R6:  The identifier to distinguish private network traffic belonging
        to one enterprise from that belonging to another enterprise must
        be globally unique.  Business communication arrangements for any
        particular enterprise can be expected to span multiple NGN
        operators potentially in multiple countries.

   Note: The indication from R1 relates primarily to the SIP signaling.
         Applying the same concept to media may be possible, but is not
         necessarily meaningful where media is routed differently from
         signaling.


6.  Overview of solution

   The mechanism proposed in this document relies on a new header field
   called 'P-Private-Network-Indication' that contains a private network
   identifier expressed as a domain name, for example:


   P-Private-Network-Indication: ericsson.com

   A proxy server which handles a message can insert such a P-Private-
   Network-Indication header field into the message based on
   authentication of the source of a message, configuration or local
   policy, and forward it to other proxies in the same administrative
   domain or proxies in trusted domain to be handled as private network
   traffic.  A proxy that forwards a message to a proxy server or UA
   that it does not trust MUST remove the P-Private-Network-Indication
   header field before forwarding the message.

   The private network identifier expressed as a domain name allows it
   to be globally unique identifier, associated with the originating
   enterprise.  Domain name is used, as it allows reuse of a company

Internet-Draft         private network indication              July 2013


   owned internet domain name, without requiring an additional private
   network identifier registry.  When the enterprise needs more than one
   identifier it can freely add subdomains under its own control.

   The formal syntax for the P-Private-Network-Indication header is
   presented in Section 8.


7.  Behavior

7.1.  Proxy behavior

7.1.1.  P-Private-Network-Indication generation

   Proxies that are responsible for determining certain traffic to be
   treated as private network traffic or contain a breaking function
   that converts incoming public network traffic to private network
   traffic MUST insert a P-Private-Network-Indication header field into
   incoming or outgoing requests for a dialog or for a standalone
   transaction.  The value MUST be set to the private network identifier
   corresponding to the enterprise to which the traffic belongs.

7.1.2.  Private-Network-Indication consumption

   Proxies that are responsible for applying different processing
   behaviors to specific private network traffic MUST support this
   extension.  The P-Private-Network-Indication header field MUST NOT be
   used by a proxy in case it is received on a request from an entity
   that it does not trust, in such case it MUST be removed before the
   request is forwarded.

7.1.3.  P-Private-Network-Indication removal

   Proxies that are at the edge of the trust domain or contain a
   breakout function that converts incoming private network traffic to
   public network traffic MUST remove the P-Private-Network-Indication
   header field before forwarding a request that contains such a header
   field with a value.


8.  P-Private-Network-Indication header field definition

   This document defines the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication header
   field.  This header field can be added by a proxy to initial requests
   for a dialog or standalone requests.  The presence of the P-Private-
   Network-Indication header field signifies to proxies that understand
   this header field that the request is to be treated as private
   network traffic.  The P-Private-Network-Indication header field



van Elburg, et al.      Expires January 13, 2014               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         private network indication              July 2013


   contains a domain name value, that allows the private network traffic
   to be associated with an enterprise, to which it belongs and that
   allows proxies that understand this header field to process the
   request according to the local policy configured for a specific
   enterprise.

   The augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) (RFC5234 [RFC5234]) syntax of
   the P-Private-Network-Indication header field is the following:


  P-Private-Network-Indication =
                         "P-Private-Network-Indication" HCOLON PNI-value
                                                     *(SEMI PNI-param)
  PNI-param                 = generic-param
  PNI-value                 = hostname

   EQUAL, HCOLON, SEMI, hostname and generic-param are defined in
   RFC3261 [RFC3261].

   The following is an example of a P-Private-Network-Indication header
   field:


   P-Private-Network-Indication: ericsson.com


9.  Security considerations

   The private network indication defined in this document is to be used
   in an environment where elements are trusted and where attackers are
   not supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those
   elements.  Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes
   achieved by using IPsec and sometimes by physically protection of the
   network.  In any case, the environment where the private network
   indication will be used ensures the integrity and the confidentiality
   of the contents of this header field.

   A private network indication received from an untrusted node MUST NOT
   be used and the information MUST be removed from a request or
   response before it is forwarded to entities in the trust domain.

   There is a security risk if a private network indication is allowed
   to propagate out of the trust domain where it was generated.  In that
   case sensitive information would be revealed by such a breach.  To
   prevent such a breach from happening, proxies MUST NOT insert the
   information when forwarding requests to a next hop located outside
   the trust domain.  When forwarding the request to a trusted node,
   proxies MUST NOT insert the header field unless they have sufficient

Internet-Draft         private network indication              July 2013


   knowledge that the route set includes another proxy in the trust
   domain that understands the header field, such as the own proxy.
   There is no automatic mechanism to learn the support for this
   specification.  Proxies MUST remove the information when forwarding
   requests to untrusted nodes or when the proxy does not have knowledge
   of any other proxy in the route set that is able to understand the
   header field.


10.  IANA considerations

   This document defines a new SIP header field: P-Private-Network-
   Indication.  This header field needs to be registered by the IANA in
   the SIP Parameters registry under the Header Fields subregistry.

Appendix A.  Alternative solutions discussed

   Note: The RFC Editor will remove these Appendixes.

A.1.  General

   It would be technical possible, but extremely complex to perform this
   function without an explicit indication.  For example, a logical
   distinction of proxies to handle private network traffic relating to
   enterprise 1, enterprise 2 and the public network traffic could be
   made by assigning different SIP URIs to these logical entities.  This
   is not regarded as a viable solution.

   Several solutions have been raised and whether or not they are
   suitable and fulfill the requirements need to be discussed:

   o  Attribute on existing header?

   o  Token on some existing header?

   o  Resource-Priority header?

   o  P-Asserted-Service header?

   o  Request-Disposition header?

   o  P-Access-Network-Information header?

   o  URI parameter?

   o  New P-header?

   o  New header?

A.2.  Attribute on existing header field

A.3.  Token value on existing header field

A.4.  Resource-Priority header field

   Some of the distinctive functions are already provided for in this
   header field.  A potential mechanism would be to define a namespace
   for private network traffic.  It would however be impossible to
   define a namespace for each enterprise, and therefore some additional
   parameter would need to be defined to carry the unique identifier of
   the particular enterprise to which the private network traffic
   relates.  Successful usage may also require a tightening of the
   procedures for use of the Resource-Priority header field (much at the
   moment is left to the particular application of this header field).

   Private network traffic may, but is not necessarily handled with a
   different priority then public network traffic.  Use of the Resource-
   Priority header field however seems to imply that the main focus of
   the indication is on prioritizing private network traffic.  This may
   render use of the Resource-Priority header field as less appropriate
   for our particular purpose.

A.5.  P-Asserted-Service header field

   The services envisaged by the P-Asserted-Service header field
   (RFC6050 [RFC6050]) are those applied to the end user.  The end user
   in these cases is the end user of the enterprise or NGCN, not the
   enterprise itself.  Therefore this header field is not considered
   suitable for this problem.

Internet-Draft         private network indication              July 2013


A.6.  Request-Disposition header field

   The Request-Disposition header field (RFC3841 [RFC3841]) specifies
   caller preferences for how a server should process a request.  The
   caller in these cases is the end user of the enterprise or NGCN, not
   the enterprise itself.  Therefore this header field is not considered
   suitable for this problem.  Further RFC3841 explicitly states that
   the set of request disposition directives is not extensible.

A.7.  P-Access-Network-Information

   The P-Access-Network-Info header field (RFC3455 [RFC3455]) contains
   information about the access network that a UA uses to get IP
   connectivity.  However the access that one uses does not define the
   private network that a call that one sets up is to be part of.

   Particular examples that illustrate this:

   o  A Hosted Enterprise Services user (i.e.  Centrex) uses the access
      of the operator while still being able to setup calls that will
      turn out to be private network traffic.

   o  A corporate network UE that attaches to an operator network, but
      receives services from its home corporate network.

A.8.  URI parameter

   A marking on the entities within the Via header field that are
   treating this as private network traffic.  Potential marking on the
   route header field of entities that are expected to treat it as
   private network traffic.

A.9.  New header field

A.9.1.  General

   If none of the existing header fields is appropriate a logical step
   is to define a new header field for the private network indication.

A.9.2.  Full SIP header field

   A full SIP header field is appropriate when the usage of this
   information element is more general then closed networks like ETSI
