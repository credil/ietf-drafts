Abstract

   In large network deployments, a single Diameter peer can support over
   a million concurrent Diameter sessions.  Recent use cases have
   revealed the need for Diameter peers to apply the same operation to a
   large group of Diameter sessions concurrently.  The Diameter base
   protocol commands operate on a single session so these use cases
   could result in many thousands of command exchanges to enforce the
   same operation on each session in the group.  In order to reduce
   signaling, it would be desirable to enable bulk operations on all (or
   part of) the sessions managed by a Diameter peer using a single or a
   few command exchanges.  This document specifies the Diameter protocol
   extensions to achieve this signaling optimization.

Internet-Draft          Diameter Group Signaling              March 2012


1.  Introduction

   In large network deployments, a single Diameter peer can support over
   a million concurrent Diameter sessions.  Recent use cases have
   revealed the need for Diameter peers to apply the same operation to a
   large group of Diameter sessions concurrently.  For example, a policy
   decision point may need to modify the authorized quality of service
   for all active users having the same type of subscription.  The
   Diameter base protocol commands operate on a single session so these
   use cases could result in many thousands of command exchanges to
   enforce the same operation on each session in the group.  In order to
   reduce signaling, it would be desirable to enable bulk operations on
   all (or part of) the sessions managed by a Diameter peer using a
   single or a few command exchanges.

   This document describes a mechanism for grouping Diameter sessions
   and performing re-authentication, re-authorization, termination and
   abortion of groups of sessions.  This document does not define a new
   Diameter application.  Instead it defines mechanisms, commands and
   AVPs that may be used by any Diameter application that requires
   management of groups of sessions.

3.  Grouping User Sessions

   Either Diameter peer may assign a session to a group.  Diameter AAA
   applications typically assign client and server roles to the Diameter
   peers.  In this document, a Diameter client is a node at the edge of
   the network that performs access control.  A Diameter server is a
   node that performs authentication and/or authorization of the user.

3.1.  Group assignment at session initiation

   To assign a session to a group at session initiation, a Diameter
   client sends a service specific auth request, e.g.  NASREQ AAR
   [RFC4005], containing zero or more client-assigned group identifiers.
   Assuming the user is successfully authenticated and/or authorized,
   the Diameter server responds with service-specific auth response,
   e.g.  NASREQ AAA [RFC4005], containing both the client-assigned group
   identifiers and zero or more server-assigned group identifiers.

3.2.  Mid-session group assignment modifications

   Either Diameter peer may modify the group membership of an active
   Diameter session.  A Diameter client MAY remove the group(s) assigned
   to the active session by the Diameter server and vice versa.

   This document does not define a permission model that limits removal
   of a session from a group by the same peer that added the session to
   the group.  However, applications which re-use the commands and
   methods defined in this document may impose their own permission
   model.  For example, an application could require that the server
   MUST NOT remove a session from a group assigned by the client.

3.2.1.  Client-initiated group assignment changes

   To update the assigned groups mid-session, a Diameter client sends a
   service specific re-authorization request containing the updated list
   of group identifiers.  Assuming the user is successfully
   authenticated and/or authorized, the Diameter server responds with a
   service-specific auth response containing the updated list of group
   identifiers received in the request.

3.2.2.  Server-initiated group assignment changes

   To update the assigned groups mid-session, a Diameter server sends a
   Re-authorization Request (RAR) message requesting re-authorization
   and the client responds with a Re-authorization Answer (RAA) message.
   The Diameter client sends a service specific re-authorization request
   containing the current list of group identifiers and the Diameter
   server responds with a service-specific auth response containing the

Internet-Draft          Diameter Group Signaling              March 2012


   updated list of group identifiers.

3.3.  Server Initiated Group Re-auth

   This document defines a new Group-Re-Auth-Request/Answer (GRAR/
   GRAA)command exchange which allows a server to initiate a re-
   authentication and/or re-authorization of all services that are
   assigned to one of the groups specified in the Session-Group-Id AVP
   in the request.

   An access device that receives a Group-Re-Auth-Request(GRAR) message
   with Session-Group-Id equal to one of the group assigned to a
   currently active session MUST initiate the type of re-auth specified
   by the Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP in the manner specified by the
   Session-Group-Action AVP if the service supports this particular
   feature.  Each Diameter application MUST state whether service-
   initiated group re-authentication and/or re-authorization is
   supported and which Session-Group-Action AVP values are supported for
   re-authorization.

   The Session-Group-Action AVP specifies whether the server requires a
   re-authorization request per session, per group or for all groups.
   For a Re-Auth-Request-Type value of AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE, the
   Session-Group-Action value MUST be PER_SESSION since re-
   authentication MUST be performed per user session.

   For Session-Group-Action values of PER_GROUP or ALL_GROUPS, the re-
   authorization is accomplished with an application-specifc group re-
   authorization command exchange.  This command exchange as well as any
   limitations on which aspects of the service can be modified during a
   re-authorization MUST be defined by the Diameter application.

   If the client is able to perform the requested re-authentication
   and/or re-authentication for the sessions assigned to the group(s)
   specified in the GRAR, it shall return a GRAA command with the
   Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS and Session-Group-Id AVP(s)
   indicating the groups for which the GRAR receiver has active sessions
   assigned.  If there are no sessions assigned to the group(s)
   specified in the GRAR, the Result-Code is set to
   DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.  If the client is unable to perform the
   requested re-authentication and/or re-authentication, the Result-Code
   is set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.

                 Figure 1: Example: Group Re-authorization

   In the example above, the Diameter server authorizes two sessions
   (ABC and DEF) and assigns them to a group named XYZ (Session-Group-
   Id=XYZ in steps 2 and 4).  Some time later, an event occurs on the
   Diameter server which requires it to change one or more of the
   service parameters for the sessions assigned to group XYZ.  The
   Diameter server sends a Group-Re-Auth-Request (step 5) specifying the
   impacted group (Session-Group-Id=XYZ) must be re-authorized (Re-Auth-
   Request-Type=AUTHORIZE_ONLY) with a single re-authorize command per
   group (Session-Group-Action=PER_GROUP).  The Diameter client
   acknowledges the request (step 6) and issues a service-specific group
   authorization request to retrieve the updated service parameters
   (step 7).

3.4.  Session Group Termination

   This document defines a new Group-Session-Termination-Request/Answer
   (GSTR/GSTA) command exchange which allows a client to communicate to
   the server the termination of all sessions that are assigned to one

Internet-Draft          Diameter Group Signaling              March 2012


   of the groups specified in the Session-Group-Id AVP in the request.
   The termination of a group of sessions could occur as a result of a
   local action or in reponse to a request to abort one or more groups
   of sessions.

   FFS: When a client sends an GSTR to a server indicating termination
   of a specific group, is it indicating termination of the sessions
   that the server authorized and that are assigned to the specified
   group?  Or does imply termination of all sessions on the client that
   are assigned to the specified group?

   Upon receipt of the GSTR, the Diameter Server MUST release all
   resources for the sessions assigned to the group(s) specified in the
   Session-Group-Id AVP and return a GSTA with the Result-Code set to
   DIAMETER_SUCCESS to acknowledge the successful termination.  If there
   are no sessions assigned to the group(s) specified in the GSTR, the
   Result-Code is set to DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.  If the server is
   unable to perform the session termination, the Result-Code is set to
   DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.

3.5.  Aborting a Group of Sessions

   This document defines a new Group-Abort-Session-Request/Answer (GASR/
   GASA)command exchange which allows a server to request the
   termination of all sessions that are assigned to one of the groups
   specified in the Session-Group-Id AVP in the request.

   A client that receives an GASR with Session-Group-Id equal to a group
   assigned to a currently active session MAY stop the session.  Whether
   the client stops the session or not is implementation- and/or
   configuration-dependent.  For example, a client may honor GASRs from
   certain agents only.  In any case, the client MUST respond with an
   Group-Abort-Session-Answer, including a Result-Code AVP to indicate
   what action it took.

   If the client is able to perform the requested termination of the
   sessions assigned to the group(s) specified in the GASR, it shall
   return a GASA command with the Result-Code AVP set to
   DIAMETER_SUCCESS and Session-Group-Id AVP(s) indicating the groups
   for which the GASR receiver has active sessions assigned.  If there
   are no sessions assigned to the group(s) specified in the GASR, the
   Result-Code is set to DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.  If the client is
   unable to perform the requested termination for any of the sessions,
   the Result-Code is set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.

   When a client terminates a session upon receipt of a Group-Abort-
   Session-Request, it MUST issue a session termination request to the
   Diameter server that authorized the service.  The Session-Group-

              Figure 2: Example: Aborting a Group of Sessions

   In the example above, the Diameter server authorizes two sessions
   (ABC and DEF) and assigns them to a group named XYZ (Session-Group-
   Id=XYZ in steps 2 and 4).  Some time later, an event occurs on the
   Diameter server which requires it to abort the sessions assigned to
   group XYZ.  The Diameter server sends a Group-Abort-Session-Request
   (step 5) specifying the sessions assigned to the impacted group
   (Session-Group-Id=XYZ) are to be terminated and a single termination
   command is to be sent per impacted group (Session-Group-
   Action=PER_GROUP).  The Diameter client acknowledges the request with
   a GASA (step 6) and issues a GSTR (step 7) command to release all
   resources for the sessions assigned to the group XYZ.  The Diameter
   server acknowledges the termination with a GGSTA (Step 8).

4.  Protocol Description

4.1.  Session Management

4.1.1.  Authorization Session State Machine

   Section 8.1 in [RFC3588] defines a set of finite state machines,
   representing the life cycle of Diameter sessions, and which MUST be
   observed by all Diameter implementations that make use of the
   authentication and/or authorization portion of a Diameter
   application.  This section defines the additional state transitions
   related to the processing of the new commands which may impact
   multiple sessions.

   The group membership is session state and therefore only those state
   machines from [RFC3588] in which the server is maintaining session
   state are relevant in this document.  As in [RFC3588], the term
   Service-Specific below refers to a message defined in a Diameter
   application (e.g., Mobile IPv4, NASREQ).

   The following state machine is observed by a client when state is
   maintained on the server.  State transitions which are unmodified
   from [RFC3588] are not repeated here.

                   AVPs for the Diameter Group Signaling

5.1.  Session-Group-Id AVP

   The Session-Group-Id AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   identifies a group of sessions.  This uniqueness scope of this AVP is
   specified by the Diameter application which makes use of group
   signaling commands.

5.2.  Session-Group-Action AVP

   The Session-Group-Action AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and
   specifies how the peer SHOULD issue follow up exchanges in response
   to a command which impacts mulitple sessions.  The following values
   are supported:

   ALL_GROUPS (0)
      Follow up exchanges should be performed with a single message
      exchange for all impacted groups.

   PER_GROUP (1)
      Follow up exchanges should be performed with a message exchange
      for each impacted group.

   PER_SESSION (2)
      Follow up exchanges should be performed with a message exchange
      for each impacted session.

6.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This section defines new Result-Code [RFC3588] values that MUST be
   supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to this
   specification.

   [Editor's Note: Group specific error values may need to be added
   here.]

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the namespaces that have either been created in
   this specification or had their values assigned to existing
   namespaces managed by IANA.

7.1.  Command Codes

   This specification requires IANA to register the following new
   Commands from the Command Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].

   o  Group-Re-Auth-Request/Answer

   o  Group-Session-Termination-Request/Answer

   o  Group-Abort-Session-Request/Answer

   The commands are defined in Section 4.2.

7.2.  AVP Codes

   This specification requires IANA to register the following new AVPs
   from the AVP Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].

   o  Session-Group-Id

   o  Session-Group-Action

   The AVPs are defined in Section 5.
