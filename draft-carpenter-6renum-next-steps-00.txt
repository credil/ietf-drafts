Internet-Draft            Next steps for 6renum            November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The IPv6 Site Renumbering (6RENUM) working group completed its
   chartered set of documents by November 2012.  The present document
   summarises for the record the next steps proposed and discussed in
   the final WG meeting.  It is posted as a draft for convenience but is
   not expected to become an RFC.

   The next steps are divided into two categories, after analysis of the
   gap analysis documents in particular [I-D.ietf-6renum-gap-analysis],
   [I-D.ietf-6renum-static-problem].  Firstly, there are items that have
   been identified as needed for site renumbering but are either not
   widely implemented or not widely used.  These items need to be
   documented in the form of advice to the community, but do not appear
   to require specification work in the IETF.  Secondly, there are items
   that may be useful for site renumbering, and which need specification
   work of some kind.  The two following sections address these two
   areas.


2.  Advice to the community

   The following items could form part of one or more informational (or
   possibly BCP) documents.

   1.  The long-standing advice that names, rather than numeric
       addresses, should be used whenever possible is reiterated.  In
       general that means DNS names, but in some circumstances it might
       mean some other form of parametric name.  A specific case is that
       IPsec security associations should use names, as allowed since
       [RFC2407], whenever possible.
   2.  Some form of name-based service discovery should be used wherever
       possible, rather than configuring service addresses.  This could
       be DNS-based, mDNS-based or even SLP.
   3.  Addresses used for internal traffic could be stabilised by
       deploying a ULA prefix (as well as a globally routed prefix).
   4.  Sites should use some sort of configuration management tool.
       This could be described as an IP address management (IPAM) tool,
       an asset management tool, or more generally as an operational
       support system (OSS).  Its role is to populate DNS, reverse DNS,
       DHCPv6, and router configurations.  The tool should use DNS names
       or parametric names in configuration files.  See
       [I-D.baker-6renum-oss-renumbering].
   5.  Include servers in DHCPv6 to avoid manual configuration.
   6.  Use Secure Dynamic DNS Update [RFC3007] where appropriate
       (requires key management in the management tool).

   7.  Plan a renumbering procedure as part of the IPv6 network design.
       Handy references include [RFC4192], [RFC5887],
       [I-D.ietf-6renum-enterprise], [I-D.ietf-6renum-gap-analysis],
       [I-D.ietf-6renum-static-problem].
   8.  Avoid software license systems that rely on IP addresses.

   Finally, it is noted that the management tool mentioned above might
   be able to take advantage of certain features that are defined but
   apparently not widely used.  In particular, these are DHCPv6
   RECONFIGURE/RENEW [RFC3315], DHCPv6-PD [RFC3633] and ICMPv6 router
   renumbering [RFC2894].  There is an open question whether the latter
   is in fact usable.


3.  IETF work items

   These are the items identified in the 6RENUM gap analysis that appear
   to need work in the appropriate IETF WGs.

   1.  Reconcile use of DHCPv6 and RA in an enterprise network.
       *  The DHCPv6 and ND state machines inside a host influence each
          other.
       *  What should a DHCPv6-configured host do when it receives RA
          messages containing a new prefix?  Current implementations
          just configure the new prefix.  Is this OK?
       *  What should a SLAAC-configured host do when it receives RA
          messages with "M" set?
       *  See analysis in [I-D.liu-6renum-dhcpv6-slaac-switching].
   2.  Bulk DHVPv6 RECONFIGURE mechanism.
   3.  Clarify how a MIPv6 host rebinds with its home agent if the
       latter is renumbered while mobile is disconnected.
   4.  Review ICMPv6 router renumbering [RFC2894] to see if it needs
       updating and if it is viable as a solution.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines no protocol, so does not introduce any new
   security exposures.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no action by IANA.
