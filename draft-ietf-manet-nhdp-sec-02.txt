                      draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-sec-02

Abstract

   This document specifies a security extension to the MANET
   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP).  The extension introduces the
   use of Integrity Check Values (ICVs) and Timestamps in HELLO messages
   in order to provide a router admittance mechanism, and therefore to
   counter a selection of security threats to NHDP.

Internet-Draft      Using ICVs and Timestamps in NHDP           May 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the use of Integrity Check Values (ICVs) for
   router admittance in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
   [RFC6130].  It specifies the use of such ICVs for validating the
   identity of the originator of a HELLO message, for validating of the
   content (i.e., the links being advertised) of a HELLO message, and
   for validating the message integrity.

   This document uses the TLVs defined in [RFC6622] within NHDP HELLO
   messages, and specifies extensions (as enabled by Section 16 in
   [RFC6130]) to the HELLO message processing.

   Schematically, the mechanism specified in this document inserts
   itself between [RFC6130] processing/generation of HELLO messages and
   [RFC5444] encoding/decoding as illustrated in Figure 1.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses the terminology of [RFC5444],
   [RFC6130], and [RFC6622].

   Additionally, this document introduces the following terminology:

   NHDP Router:
      A MANET router, running NHDP as specified in [RFC6130].


3.  Applicability Statement

   [RFC6130] enables extensions to recognize additional reasons for
   rejecting a message as "badly formed and therefore invalid for
   processing", and mentions security as an explicit example.

   This document:

   o  Specifies an extension to [RFC6130] by providing a framework for
      associating ICVs to messages and for using such invalid ICVs as
      one such "additional reason" for rejecting a message as "badly
      formed and therefore invalid for processing".

   o  Uses the containers for carrying ICVs and timestamps, as well as
      the registries for cryptographic code-points, specified in
      [RFC6622].

   o  Is applicable where ICVs are an appropriate security solution.
      Note that the choice of the cryptographic function are to be made
      for each given deployment, and that the choice of such is out of
      scope for this document.

   o  Assumes that a router which is able to generate correct ICVs
      (e.g., has valid cryptographic keys), is considered trusted.

   o  Assumes that the TLV type extension of the ICV Message TLV, as
      defined in [RFC6622] is 1, i.e., that an ICV is composed of a
      cryptographic function over a hash value of the message as defined
      in Section 12 of [RFC6622].

   This document does NOT:

Internet-Draft      Using ICVs and Timestamps in NHDP           May 2012


   o  Specify how to distribute cryptographic keys, shared secrets,
      parameters for cryptographic functions, etc.

   o  Specify how to detect compromised routers with valid keys.

   o  Specify how to handle compromised routers with valid keys, i.e.,
      key-revocation etc.


4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   The framework presented in this document provides two
   functionalities:

   o  Generation of an ICV for an outgoing HELLO message.

   o  Verification of an ICV in order to determine if an incoming HELLO
      message MUST be rejected as "badly formed and therefore invalid
      for processing" [RFC6130].

   When an NHDP Router generates a HELLO message on an interface, this
   extension:

   o  Specifies how to calculate an ICV for the message.

   o  Specifies how to include that ICV by way of a TLV.

   The framework allows for adding several ICVs with different hash and
   cryptographic functions.

   [RFC6130] allows for rejecting incoming HELLO messages prior to
   processing by NHDP.  This extension specifies that for each ICV TLV
   in the Message TLV Block of an incoming message, the message MUST be
   rejected if the ICV can not be verified.


5.  HELLO Message Content

   HELLO messages MUST have the content as specified in [RFC6130].  In
   addition, in order to conform to this specification, each HELLO
   message MUST contain:

   o  A <msg-orig-addr> element (as specified in [RFC5444]).

   o  A <msg-seq-num> element (as specified in [RFC5444]).

   o  One or more ICV TLVs (as specified in [RFC6622]), generated
      according to Section 6.



Herberg & Clausen       Expires November 30, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Using ICVs and Timestamps in NHDP           May 2012


   If protection against replay attacks is desired, then a HELLO message
   MUST also contain:

   o  A TIMESTAMP TLV (as specified in [RFC6622]).


6.  HELLO Message Generation

   After HELLO message generation ([RFC6130] Section 11.1) and before
   HELLO message transmission ([RFC6130] Section 11.2), as permitted by
   [RFC6130] Section 12.1, the additional elements specified in
   Section 5 MUST (unless already present) be added to an outgoing HELLO
   message.

   The following processing steps MUST be taken for each cryptographic
   algorithm that is used for generating ICVs for a HELLO message:

   1.  All existing TLVs (if any) of type ICV are temporarily removed
       from the message.  Any temporarily removed TLVs MUST be stored,
       for being reinserted into the message in step 5.

   2.  The message size is recalculated to the size of the message
       without the temporarily removed ICV TLVs.

   3.  The ICV value is calculated over the whole message (as resulting
       after step 2) according to the chosen hash and cryptographic
       function and according to Section 12.1 of [RFC6622].

   4.  A TLV of type ICV and with type extension 1 is added in the
       Message TLV block, with the content according to Section 12.1 of
       [RFC6622].

   5.  All other ICV TLVs that have been temporary removed, are
       restored.

   6.  The message size is recalculated, including the new ICV TLV as
       well as any restored temporarily removed ICV TLVs.


7.  HELLO Message Processing

   [RFC6130] specifies that:

      "On receiving a HELLO message, a router MUST first check if the
      message is invalid for processing by this router"

   [RFC6130] proceeds to give a number of conditions that, each, will
   lead to a rejection of the HELLO message as "badly formed and



Herberg & Clausen       Expires November 30, 2012               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Using ICVs and Timestamps in NHDP           May 2012


   therefore invalid for processing".  This document adds the following
   conditions to that list which, if true, MUST cause NHDP to consider
   the HELLO message as invalid for processing:

   o  The HELLO message does not include a <msg-orig-addr> element.

   o  The HELLO message does not include a <msg-seq-num> element.

   o  The Message TLV block of the HELLO message contains more than one
      TIMESTAMP TLV with the same type extension.

   o  Validation of ICVs in the Message TLV block of the HELLO message
      fails, according to Section 7.1.

   o  If protection against replay attacks is desired, validation of the
      TIMESTAMP TLV of the message fails, according to Section 7.2.

7.1.  Invalidating a Message Based on ICVs

   1.  For each ICV Message TLV in the HELLO message, the ICV TLV is
       temporarily removed if:

       *  The ICV Message TLV type extension is not equal to 1; OR

       *  The ICV Message TLV type extension is equal to 1, AND the hash
          function and the cryptographic function indicated in that ICV
          Messsage TLV are unknown to the NHDP Router.

   2.  If no ICV Message TLVs remain after step 1, then validation
       fails:

       *  The HELLO message MUST be considered "badly formed and
          therefore invalid for processing", and MUST be discarded.

   3.  Otherwise, the HELLO message with the remaining ICV Message TLVs
       (henceforth: "Known ICV Message TLVs") is processed as follows:

       1.  All Known ICV Message TLVs are temporarily removed from the
           message, and the message size is recalculated.

       2.  Each of the temporarily removed Known ICV Message TLVs from
           the step above is, then, processed as follows:

           +  Calculate the message-hash-value over the HELLO message,
              using the hash function indicated by <hash-function> in
              the Known ICV Message TLV.

Internet-Draft      Using ICVs and Timestamps in NHDP           May 2012


           +  Calculate the message-ICV-Value over the resulting
              message-hash-value, using the cryptographic function, and
              the key ID, indicated by <cryptographic-function> and
              <key-id> in the Known ICV Message TLV.

           +  If message-ICV-Value differs from the value of <ICV-data>
              in the Known ICV Message TLV, then validation fails:

              -  The HELLO message MUST be considered "badly formed and
                 therefore invalid for processing", and MUST be
                 discarded.

   4.  Otherwise, the message is considered (with respect to this
       specification) "valid for processing", and:

       A.  All temporarily removed ICV Message TLVs (i.e., all ICV TLVs
           temporarily removed in both step 1 and step 3) are restored.

       B.  The message size is restored.

7.2.  Invalidating a Message Based on Timestamps

   An NHDP Router which requires protection against replay attacks MUST:

   o  Be configured with a list of TIMESTAMP type extensions, which it
      supports.

   o  For each of these TIMESTAMP type extensions, define
      MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF as the maximum allowed difference between the
      "expected timestamp value" and the "timestamp value" encoded in
      the TIMESTAMP TLV of an incoming HELLO message (e.g., to
      accommodate for propagation delays across a network).

   A HELLO message MUST be considered "badly formed and therefore
   invalid for processing", and MUST be discarded if either of the two
   following conditions are true:

   o  The Message TLV Block of the HELLO message does not contain a
      TIMESTAMP TLV with a type extension matching (one of) the
      timestamp types, known by the receiving NHDP Router.

   o  The Message TLV Block of the HELLO message does contain a
      TIMESTAMP TLV with a type extension matching (one of) the
      timestamp types, known by the receiving NHDP Router, but where the
      value of that TIMESTAMP TLV differs from the expected value by
      more than MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF.

Internet-Draft      Using ICVs and Timestamps in NHDP           May 2012


8.  Provisioning of NHDP Routers

   Before an NHDP Router is able to generate ICVs or validate messages,
   it MUST acquire the cryptographic key(s) and any parameters of the
   cryptographic function from all other routers that are to participate
   in the network.  This document does not specify how a router acquires
   the cryptographic keys and parameters used in the MANET.


9.  Summary of NHDP Interaction

   When using the NHDP security extension, specified in this document,
   the following MUST be observed:

   o  HELLO messages MUST be generated according to [RFC6130].

   o  Outgoing HELLO messages, generated by [RFC6130], MUST be processed
      according to Section 6 after their generation and prior to their
      transmission by [RFC6130], in order that (an) ICV TLV(s) can be
      generated and inserted, as allowed by Section 16 in [RFC6130].

   o  Any other extension to [RFC6130] which adds information to a HELLO
      message MUST do so prior to the HELLO message being handed off for
      ICV generation according to this specification.

   o  An incoming HELLO message MUST be processed according to Section 7
      prior to processing by [RFC6130] as allowed in Section 16 in
      [RFC6130].

   o  Any other NHDP extension, which has added information to a HELLO
      message and which wishes that the HELLO message is rejected if an
      ICV is not valid, MUST likewise process the HELLO message only
      after its processing according to this specification.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


11.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a protocol extension to NHDP which allows for
   alleviating some of the security threats of NHDP analyzed in
   [NHDP-sec-threats].

Internet-Draft      Using ICVs and Timestamps in NHDP           May 2012


11.1.  Alleviated Attacks

   This section briefly summarizes which of the security threats, from
   among those detailed in [NHDP-sec-threats], that are alleviated by
   the framework presented in this document.

11.1.1.  Identity Spoofing

   As only NHDP Routers possessing valid cryptographic keys are able to
   add ICV TLVs HELLO messages, in a way which permits that these be
   validated successfully, identity spoofing is counteracted.

11.1.2.  Link Spoofing

   Link spoofing is counteracted by the framework specified in this
   document, with the same argument as in Section 11.1.1.  A router
   without access to valid cryptographic keys cannot generate valid ICVs
   for inclusion in a HELLO message.

11.1.3.  Replay Attack

   Replay attacks are only counteracted if TIMESTAMP TLVs are included
   in HELLO messages.  This is optional, and depends on synchronized
   clocks of all routers in the MANET.  An attacker which records
   messages to replay them later can only do so in the time interval
   between the timestamp that is contained in the TIMESTAMP TLV and
   MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF later.  As an attacker cannot modify the content
   of the TIMESTAMP TLV (since it does not possess the valid
   cryptographic keys for generating valid ICV TLVs), it cannot replay
   messages after this time interval.  Within this time interval,
   however, it is still possible to perform replay attacks.

11.2.  Limitations

   Since jamming is a physical layer issue, it cannot be alleviated by
   protocols on the routing layer.  This framework does not counteract
   jamming attacks.

   If no synchronized clocks are available in the MANET, replay attacks
   cannot be counteracted by the framework provided by this document.

   The framework provided by this document does not avoid or detect
   security attacks by routers possessing the cryptographic keys that
   are used to generate ICVs for messages.

   This document depends on the quality of the used cipher algorithm and
   hash function, and is as such subject the same security
   considerations as applies to these.

   This document relies on an out-of-band protocol or mechanism for
   distributing keys and cryptographic parameters.  The security
   considerations of such protocol or mechanism also apply.

   This document does also not provide a key revocation mechanism.
