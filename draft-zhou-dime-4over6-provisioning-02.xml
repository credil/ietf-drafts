    <abstract>
      <t>During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment may
      have to support one of the various transition methods that have been
      or are currently being defined for carrying IPv4 packets over IPv6.
      Work is currently in progress to enumerate the information that needs
      to be provisioned on a customer edge router to support a list of
      transition techniques based on tunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to
      defining reusable components for a reasonable transition path between
      these techniques. To the extent that the provisioning is done
      dynamically, AAA support is needed to provide the information to the
      network server responsible for passing the information to the customer
      equipment. This document specifies Diameter attribute-value pairs to be
      used for that purpose. </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
    
      <t>A number of transition technologies have been or are being defined
      to allow IPv4 packets to pass between hosts and IPv4 networks over an
      intervening IPv6 network while minimizing the number of public IPv4
      addresses that need to be consumed by the hosts. Different operators
      will deploy different technologies, and sometimes one operator will
      use more than one technology, depending on what is supported by the
      available equipment and upon other factors both technical and
      economic. </t>
      
      <t>Each technique requires the provisioning of some subscriber-specific
      information on the customer edge device. The provisioning may be by DHCP
      or by some other method. This document is indifferent to the specific
      provisioning technique used, but assumes that the information originates
      in the AAA infrastructure because in some networks, the user configuration
      information may be managed by AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and
      Accounting) servers. In a fixed line broadband network, the Broadband
      Network Gateways (BNGs) act as the access gateway of users. When the BR
      and BNG are co-located in one device, the approach defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map-radius"/> could be used to acquire the
      subscriber-specific information via RADIUS. In some deployments when the
      location of the BR is higher than BNG, the subscriber-specific information
      will be pushed from AAA server to the BR actively via Diameter <xref
      target="RFC6733"/>. To allow the information to be carried in Diameter ,
      this document specifies a number of attribute-value pairs (AVPs) for the
      purpose. </t> 
      
      <t>This document takes as its scope the set of transition methods
      provided for by <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-unified-cpe"/>. That
      document enumerates the information that must be provisioned in the
      customer edge router to support Dual-Stack Lite <xref target="RFC6333"/>,
      Public IPv4 Over IPv6 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6"/>,
      Light Weight IPv4 Over IPv6 (LW4o6) 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6"/>,
      and Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"/>.</t>
      
      <t>Several documents provide related specifications for RADIUS <xref
      target="RFC2865"/>, for individual transition methods. Potentially
      there could be a reconciliation between the contents of those
      documents and the present one, but that has not been done in the
      present version of this document.</t>

    <section anchor="reqts" title="Description of the Parameters Required By Each Transition Method">

      <t>This section reviews the parameters that need to be provisioned for
      each of the transition methods listed above. This enumeration provides
      the justification for the AVPs defined in the next section. Since most
      of the transition methods dealt with here are works in progress, this
      section is subject to modification in future versions.</t>
      
      <t>A means is required to indicate which transition method(s) a given
      subscriber is allowed to use. 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-unified-cpe"/> specifies how to infer the
      intended method from other DHCP parameters received. The approach taken in
      this document is to specify grouped AVPs specific to the individual
      transition methods. The operator can control which transition method a
      given subscriber uses by ensuring that AAA passes only the grouped AVP
      relevant to that method.</t> 
      
      <section anchor="dslite" title="Parameters For Dual-Stack Lite">

        <t>Dual-Stack Lite is documented in <xref target="RFC6333"/>. It
        requires the following parameters to be provisioned at the B4 at the
        customer premises. This enumeration does not include the normal
        provisioning of an IPv6 prefix to the customer equipment. The section
        numbers shown are where these requirements are indicated in 
        <xref target="RFC6333"/>.
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>IPv6 address of the border router (AFTR) (sec. 5.4);</t>
          
          <t>IPv6 address of a DNS recursive server (sec. 5.5). This is probably
          supplied already independently of transition technology, so does not
          have to be covered here.</t>
          
          <t>optionally, the IPv4 address of the B4 interface facing the
          tunnel, where the default value in the absence of provisioning is 
          192.0.0.2 and valid values are 192.0.0.2 through 192.0.0.7 
          (sec. 5.7). Provisioning this information through AAA is problematic
          because it is most likely used in a case where multiple B4 instances
          occupy the same device. This document therefore assumes that the B4
          interface address is determined by other means (implementation-
          dependent or static assignment). </t>

      <section anchor="pub4o6" title="Public IPv4 Over IPv6">

        <t>Public IPv4 Over IPv6 is described in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6"/>. Besides the usual 
        IPv6 prefix or address information, it requires two parameters to be 
        provisioned to the customer equipment: 
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>a public IPv4 address;</t>
          
          <t>IPv6 address of the border router</t>
        </list>
        It also requires per-subscriber provisioning on the border router:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>binding between the customer IPv4 address and the customer 
          IPv6 prefix, for routing of incoming packets to the correct tunnel.</t>

        <t>Light Weight IPv4 Over IPv6 (LW4o6) is documented in 
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6"/>. Its
        provisioning requirements are exactly the same as those for Public
        4over6 with one addition:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>both the customer equipment and the border router are provided with
          a port set identifier identifying the set of ports to which the
          subscriber's incoming and outgoing packets on the public side are
          restricted. The port selection algorithm and port set identifier as
          such are not discussed in the draft. For the present version of this
          document, it is assumed that the algorithm is known in advance and the
          port set identifier has the form of an index ranging from zero to the
          number of subscribers sharing a given address less 1. This is similar
          to the port set identifier in MAP-E, described next.</t>

      <section anchor="map-e" title="Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)">

        <t>Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E) is described
        in <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"/>. MAP-E requires the
        provisioning of the following per-subscriber information at the
        customer edge device: 
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>whether the device is to operate in mesh or hub-and-spoke mode;</t>
          
          <t>the IPv6 address of one or more border routers;</t>
          
          <t>the specially constructed End-user IPv6 prefix for the customer
          edge device. <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"/> suggests that this
          would be supplied as part of normal IPv6 provisioning, so it can be
          ignored as a requirement here. </t>
          
          <t>the Basic Mapping Rule for the customer edge device. This 
          includes the following parameters:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>the rule IPv6 prefix and length;</t>
            
            <t>the rule IPv4 prefix and length;</t>
            
            <t>the number of "Extended Address" (EA) bits included in the 
            End-user IPv6 prefix;</t>
            
            <t>of those Extended Address bits, the number that precede the port
            set identifier. The default value is 6.</t>
          </list>
          </t>
          
          <t>in mesh mode only, zero or more Forwarding Mapping Rules,
          containing the same parameters as the Basic Mapping rule.</t>
            
          <t>optionally, the port set identifier if the EA bits do not carry it.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>The border router needs to be configured with the superset of the
        Forwarding MAP Rules passed to the customer sites it serves. Since
        this is not subscriber-specific, even though it introduces no new
        requirements to this document, it is out of scope.</t>
