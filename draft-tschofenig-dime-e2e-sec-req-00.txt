Internet-Draft         Diameter AVP Level Security         February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Diameter Base specification [1] offers security protection
   between neighboring Diameter peers and mandates that either TLS (for
   TCP), DTLS (for SCTP), or IPsec is used.  These security protocols
   offer a wide range of security properties, including entity
   authentication, data-origin authentication, integrity,
   confidentiality protection and replay protection.  They also support
   a large number of cryptographic algorithms, algorithm negotiation,
   and different types of credentials.

   The need to also offer additional security protection of AVPs between
   non-neighboring Diameter nodes was recognized very early in the work
   on Diameter.  This lead to work on Diameter security using the
   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [3].  Due to lack of deployment
   interest at that time (and the complexity of the developed solution)
   the specification was, however, never completed.

   In the meanwhile Diameter had received a lot of deployment interest
   from the cellular operator community and because of the
   sophistication of those deployments the need for protecting Diameter
   AVPs between non-neighboring nodes re-surfaced.  Since early 2000
   (when the work on [3] was discontinued) the Internet community had
   seen advances in cryptographic algorithms (for example, authenticated
   encryption algorithms were developed) and new requirements emerged.

   This document collects requirements for developing a solution to
   protect Diameter AVPs.

2.  Terminology

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in [2].

   This document re-uses terminology from the Diameter base
   specification [1].

3.  Use Case

   Consider the following use case shown in Figure 1.  A Diameter client
   interacts with a Diameter server through two Diameter proxies.  The
   Diameter client and the Diameter Proxy A belong to the same realm,
   example.com.


   ****************************
                              *
      Realm: Example.com      *
   +--------+      +--------+ *      +--------+        +--------+
   |Diameter|      |Diameter| *      |Diameter|        |Diameter|
   |Client  +------+Proxy A +-*------+Proxy B +--------+Server  |
   +--------+      +--------+ *      +--------+        +--------+
       ^                      *                             ^
       .           End-to-End * Security Protection         .
       +......................*.............................+
                              *
   ****************************


               Figure 1: Example Diameter Deployment Setup.

   The Diameter AVPs are protected end-to-end, from the Diameter client
   to the Diameter server, as shown in Figure 1 with the dotted line.

   Other use cases are possible as well.  For example, Diameter Proxy A
   could act on behalf of the Diameter clients in the example.com realm.
   In a general case, however, encryption of AVPs between arbitrary
   Diameter nodes can be challenging since it is upfront not know what
   Diameter nodes a message will traverse.

      QUESTION:  Which scenarios should be supported?  Should the focus
      be on the protection of selected Diameter AVPs between the
      Diameter client to the Diameter server only?

4.  Requirements

   Requirement #1:  Solutions MUST support an extensible set of
      cryptographic algorithms.

         Motivation:  Crypto-agility is the ability of a protocol to
         adapt to evolving cryptographic algorithms and security
         requirements.  This may include the provision of a modular
         mechanism to allow cryptographic algorithms to be updated
         without substantial disruption to deployed implementations.

   Requirement #2:  Solutions MUST support confidentiality, integrity,
      and data-origin authentication.

         QUESTION:  Should solutions for integrity protection work in a
         backwards-compatible way with existing Diameter applications?
         Should the list of integrity protected AVP be indicated in the
         protected payload itself?

   Requirement #3:  Solutions MUST support replay protection.

         QUESTION:  Should replay protection be based on timestamps
         (i.e., assume synchronized clocks in Diameter networks)?

   Requirement #4:  Solutions MUST be able to selectively apply their
      cryptographic protection to certain Diameter AVPs.

   Requirement #5:  Solutions MUST recommend a mandatory-to-implement
      cryptographic algorithm.

   Requirement #6:  QUESTION:  Should we support symmetric keys and / or
      also asymmetric keys?

   Requirement #7:  QUESTION:  Should requirements for dynamic key
      management be included in this document as well?

   Requirement #8:  QUESTION:  Should statically provisioned keys be
      supported?

   Requirement #9:  QUESTION:  Should solutions allow the provisioning
      of long-term shared symmetric credentials via a command-line
      interface / text file?
