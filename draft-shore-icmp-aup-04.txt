         An Acceptable Use Policy for New ICMP Types and Codes
                        draft-shore-icmp-aup-04

Abstract

   In this document we provide a basic description of ICMP's role in the
   IP stack and some guidelines for future use.

   This document is motivated by concerns about lack of clarity
   concerning when to add new Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
   types and/or codes.  These concerns have highlighted a need to
   describe policies for when adding new features to ICMP is desirable
   and when it is not.

1.  Introduction

   There has been some recent concern expressed about a lack of clarity
   around when to add new message types and codes to ICMP (including
   ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443]).  We attempt to lay out a
   description of when (and when not) to move functionality into ICMP.

   This document is the result of discussions among ICMP experts within
   the OPS area's IP Diagnostics Technical Interest Group [1] and
   concerns expressed by the OPS area leadership.

2.  Acceptable use policy

   In this document we describe a proposed acceptable use policy for new
   ICMP message types and codes, and provide some background behind the
   proposed policy.

   In summary, we propose that any future message types added to ICMP
   should be limited to two broad categories:

   1.  to inform a datagram's originator that a forwarding plane anomaly
       has been encountered downstream.  The datagram originator must be
       able to determine whether or not the datagram was discarded by
       examining the ICMP message

   2.  to discover on-link routers and hosts, and network-specific
       parameters

   While ICMP's role is not to be a general-purpose network management
   protocol, it does have a role to play in conveying dynamic
   information about a network.

      155:  RPL control message

2.1.1.  A few notes on RPL

   RPL, the IPv6 Routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (see
   [RFC6550]) appears to be something of an outlier among the existing
   ICMP message types, as the expansion of its acronym appears to be an
   actual routing protocol using ICMP for transport.

   This should be considered anomalous and is not a model for future
   ICMP message types.  Our understanding is that the working group
   initially defined a discovery protocol extending existing ICMPv6 ND
   messages before moving to its own native ICMP type.

   It is typically the case that routing protocols have transport
   requirements that are not met by ICMP.  For example, there will be
   reliability guarantees and security guarantees that are not provided
   by ICMP, forcing protocol developers to design their own mechanisms.
   Given the availability of other IETF standard transports for routing,
   this reinvention should be avoided.

2.2.  Extending ICMP

   ICMP multi-part messages are specified in [RFC4884] by defining an
   extension mechanism for selected ICMP messages.  This mechanism
   addresses a fundamental problem in ICMP extensibility.  An ICMP
   multi-part message carries all of the information that ICMP messages
   carried previously, as well as additional information that
   applications may require.

   Some currently defined ICMP extensions include ICMP extensions for
   Multiprotocol Label Switching [RFC4950] and ICMP extensions for
   interface and next-hop identification [RFC5837].

   Extensions to ICMP should follow [RFC4884].

3.  ICMP's role in the internet

   ICMP was originally intended to be a mechanism for routers to report
   error conditions back to hosts in ICMPv4 [RFC0792], and ICMPv6
   [RFC4443] models after it.  The word "control" in the protocol name
   did not describe ICMP's function (i.e. it did not "control" the
   internet), but rather that it was used to communicate about the
   control functions in the internet.  For example, even though ICMP
   included a redirect message type that affects routing behavior in the
   context of a LAN segment, it was and is not used as a generic routing
   protocol.

   Most likely because of the presence of the word "control" in the
   protocol name, ICMP is often understood to be a control protocol,
   borrowing some terminology from circuit networks and the PSTN.  That
   is probably not correct - it might be more correct to describe it as
   being closer to a management plane protocol, given the data plane/
   control plane/ management plane taxonomy often used in describing
   telephony protocols.  However, layering in IP networks is not very
   clean and there's often some intermingling of function that can tend
   to lead to confusion about where to place new functions.

   In following sections we provide some background on the differences
   between control and management traffic.

4.  Management vs. control

   In this section we attempt to draw a distinction between management
   and control planes, acknowledging in advance that this may serve to
   muddle the differences even further.  Ultimately the difference may
   not matter that much for the purpose of creating a policy for adding
   new types to ICMP, but because that terminology has become
   ubiquitous, even in IETF discussions, and because it has come up in
   prior discussions of ICMP policies, it seems worthwhile to take a few
   paragraph to describe what they are and what they are not.

   The terms "management plane" and "control plane" came into use to
   describe one aspect of layering in telecommunications networks.  It
   is particularly important, in the context of this discussion, to
   understand that "control plane" in telecomm networks almost always
   refers to 'signaling,' or call control and network control
   information.  This includes "call" establishment and teardown, route
   establishment and teardown, requesting QoS or other parameters, and
   so on.

   "Management," on the other hand, tends to fall under the rubric
   "OAM," or "Operations, Administration, and Management." typical
   functions include fault management and performance monitoring
   (Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance), discovery, etc.

   The correct answer to the question of where ICMP fits into the
   management/control/data taxonomy is that it doesn't, at least not
   neatly.  While some of the message types are unambiguously management
   message, at least within the narrow confines of a management/control
   dichotomy (ICMP type 3, or "unreachable" messages), others are less
   clearly identifiable.  For example, the "redirect" (ICMP type 5)
   message can be construed to contain control (in this case, routing)
   information, even though it is in some very real sense an error
   message.

   At this time,

   o  there are many, many other protocols that can be (and are) used
      for control traffic, whether they're routing protocols, telephony
      signaling protocols, QoS protocols, middlebox protocols, AAA
      protocols, etc.

   o  the transport characteristics needed by control traffic can be
      incompatible with the ICMP protocol standard -- for example, they
      may require reliable delivery, very large payloads, or have
      security requirements that cannot be met.

   and because of this we propose that any future message types added to
   ICMP should conform to the policy proposed in Section 2.  ICMP should
   not be used as a routing or network management protocol.

5.  Security considerations

   This document attempts to describe a high-level policy for adding
   ICMP types and codes.  While special attention must be paid to the
   security implications of any particular new ICMP type or code, this
   recommendation presents no security considerations.

6.  IANA considerations

   There are no actions required by IANA.

7.  Acknowledgments

   This document was originally proposed by, and received substantial
   review and suggestions from, Ron Bonica.  Discussions with Pascal
   Thubert helped clarify the history of RPL's use of ICMP.  We are
