 Add 100.64.0.0/10 prefixes to IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones registry.
                 draft-andrews-dnsop-rfc6598-rfc6303-01

Abstract

   RFC6598 specified that: "reverse DNS queries for 100.64/10 MUST NOT
   be forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure".

   This document formally directes IANA to add the associated zones to
   the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones" registry to prevent such queries
   accidently leaking to the global DNS infrastructure.

Internet-Draft     Locally-Served DNS Zones Additions       October 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC6598] specified that "reverse DNS queries for 100.64/10 MUST NOT
   be forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure".  [RFC6303] provides
   guidance on handling such queries.

   This document directs the IANA to add the IPv4 reverse zones
   corresponding to 100.64.0.0/10, a netblock reserved in [RFC6598], to
   the IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zone Registry established in [RFC6303].

   Unlike [RFC1918] address, which are not expected to be seen by other
   parties, the addresses from [RFC6598] are expected to be seen by
   parties other than those deploying the addresses, so it is more
   crucial that recursive nameservers default to serving these zones
   locally.


2.  Changes to IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones

   To add the following zone listed in RFC6598 Zones (Section 2.1) to
   the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zone" registry.
