   Abstract 

   [RFC4874] specifies methods by which route exclusions may be 
   communicated during RSVP-TE signaling in networks where precise 
   explicit paths are not computed by the LSP ingress node. This 
   document specifies signaling for additional route exclusions based 
   on LSPs currently existing or expected to exist within the network.

   1. Introduction 

      Label-Switched Path (LSP) diversity is required to ensure LSPs may 
      be established without sharing resources, thus greatly reducing 
      the probability of simultaneous connection failures.  

      LSP diversity is a well-known requirement from Service Providers. 
      When route computation for LSPs that need to be diverse is 
      performed at ingress node, this requirement can be met by a local 
      decision at that node. However, there are scenarios when route 
      computations are performed by remote nodes, in which case there is 
      a need for relevant diversity requirements to be communicated to 
      those nodes. These include (but are not limited to): 

      .  LSPs with loose hops in the Explicit Route Object (ERO), e.g. 
        inter-domain LSPs.   

      .  Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-
        Network Interface (UNI) where route computation may be 
        performed by the (sever layer) core node [RFC4208]; 

      The eXclude Route Object (XRO) and Explicit Exclusion Route 
      Subobject (EXRS) specification [RFC4874] introduces a means of 
      specifying nodes and resources to be excluded from routes, using 
      the XRO and/ or EXRS.  

      [RFC4874] facilitates the calculation of diverse routes for LSPs 
      based on known properties of those LSPs including addresses of 
      links and nodes traversed, and Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) of 
      traversed links. This requires that these properties of the LSP(s) 
      from which diversity is required be known to the ingress node 
      which initiates signaling. However, there are circumstances under 
      which this may not be possible or desirable, including (but not 
      limited to): 

      .  Exclusion of the route of a LSP which does not originate, 
         terminate or traverse the ingress node signaling the diverse 
         LSP, in which case the addresses and SRLGs of the LSP from 
         which diversity is required are unknown to the ingress node.

         Internet Draft      draft-ali-ccamp-xro-lsp-subobject-02.txt 


      .  Exclusion of the route of a LSP which, while known at the 
         ingress node of the diverse LSP, has incomplete or unavailable 
         route information, e.g. due to confidentiality of the LSP route 
         attributes. In other words, the scenario in which the reference 
         LSP is hosted by the ingress/ requesting node but the 
         properties required to construct an XRO object are not known to 
         ingress/ requesting node. Inter-domain and GMPLS overlay 
         networks may present such restrictions.  

      .  If the route of the reference LSP from which diversity is 
         required (e.g. LSP1) is known to the ingress node, that node 
         can use this information to construct an XRO and send it in the 
         path message during the signaling of a diverse LSP (LSP2). 
         However, if the route of LSP1 changes (e.g. due to re-
         optimization or failure in the network), the ingress node would 
         need to change path of LSP2 to ensure that it remains diverse 
         from LSP1. It is preferable to have this decision made by the 
         node that calculated the path for LSP2. For example, in the 
         case of GMPLS-UNI, it is better to have such responsibility at 
         the server layer as opposed to at the client layer so that the 
         diversity requirements are transparent to the client layer. 
         Furthermore, in all networking scenarios, if the node 
         performing the route computation/ expansion is aware of the 
         diversity requirements of LSP1 and LSP2, it may consider joint 
         re-optimization of the diverse LSPs.  

      This document addresses such scenarios and defines procedures 
      that may be used to exclude the route taken by a particular LSP, 
      or the route taken by all LSPs belonging to a single tunnel. Note 
      that this diversity requirement is different from the diversity 
      requirements of path protection where both the reference and 
      diverse LSPs belong to the same tunnel. The diversity 
      requirements considered in this document do not require that the 
      LSPs in question belonging to the same tunnel or share an ingress 
      node.  

      The means by which the node calculating or expanding the route of 
      the signaled LSP discovers the route of the LSPs from which the 
      signaled LSP requires diversity is beyond the scope of this 
      document. However, in most cases the LSPs with route diversity 
      requirements may transit the node expanding the route.  

      This document addresses only the exclusion of point-to-point 
      tunnels; point-to-multipoint tunnels will be addressed in a 
      future version. Similarly, at present only IPv4 addresses are 
      considered; support for IPv6 addresses will be added in a future 
      version.

   1.1. Requirements Notation 

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
      [RFC2119]. 

   2. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

      This section describes the signaling extensions required to 
      address the aforementioned requirements. Specifically, this 
      document defines a new LSP subobject to be signaled in the 
      EXCLUDE_ROUTE object (XRO) and/ or Explicit Exclusion Route 
      Subobject (EXRS) defined in [RFC4874]. Inclusion of the LSP 
      subobject in any other RSVP object is not defined.  

   2.1. Terminology 

      In this document, the following terminology is adopted:  

      LSP1/TUNNEL1: LSP1/TUNNEL1 is the LSP/tunnel from which diversity 
      is required. 

      LSP2/TUNNEL2: The term LSP2/TUNNEL2 is used to refer the LSP 
      being signaled with XRO/ EXRS containing the LSP subobject 
      referencing LSP1/TUNNEL1.  

      CircuitID: The term CircuitID refers to the LSP Forwarding 
      Equivalence Class (FEC) (LSP ID field of the FEC may be ignored 
      depending on the context the CircuitID term is used).  

      CircuitIDx: The term CicuitIDx refers to CircuitID of 
      LSPx/TUNNELx.  

   2.2. LSP Subobjects 

      New IPv4 and IPv6 Point-to-Point (P2P) LSP subobject are defined 
      by this document as follows. 

   2.2.1. IPv4 Point-to-Point LSP subobject

        L 
             The L-flag is used as for the other XRO subobjects defined 
             in [RFC4874]. 
             0 indicates that the attribute specified MUST be excluded.  
             1 indicates that the attribute specified SHOULD be 
             avoided.  
    
        Type  
         
             IPv4 Point-to-Point LSP subobject 
                       (to be assigned by IANA suggested value: 36). 
         

        Length 

            The length contains the total length of the subobject in 
            bytes, including the type and length fields. The length is 
            always 24. 

        Attribute Flags 

            The Attribute Flags are used to communicate desirable 
            attributes of the LSP being signaled (In the following, the 
            term LSP2 is used to reference the LSP being signaled; 
            please refer to Section 2.1 for definition of LSP2). The 
            following flags are defined. None, all or multiple 
            attribute flags MAY be set within the same subobject.  

            0x01 = LSP ID to be ignored

               This flag is used to indicate tunnel level exclusion. 
               Specifically, this flag is used to indicate that the 
               lsp-id field of the subobject is to be ignored and the 
               exclusion applies to any LSP matching the rest of the 
               supplied FEC. In other words, if this flag is set, the 
               processing node MUST calculate a route based on 
               exclusions from the routes of all known LSPs matching 
               the tunnel-id, source, destination and extended tunnel-
               id specified in the subobject.  

               When this flag is not set, the lsp-id is not ignored and 
               the exclusion applies only to the specified LSP (i.e., 
               LSP level exclusion). In other words, when this flag is 
               not set, route exclusions MUST respect the specified LSP 
               (i.e. the lsp-id, the tunnel-id, source, destination and 
               extended tunnel-id specified needs to be respected 
               during exclusion).  

            0x02 = Destination node exception 

               This flag is used to indicate that the destination node 
               may be shared even when sharing of the said node 
               violates the exclusion flags. When this flag is not set, 
               the exclusion flags SHOULD also be respected for the 
               destination node.  

            0x04 = Processing node exception 

               This flag is used to indicate that the processing node 
               may be shared even when sharing of the said node 
               violates the exclusion flags. When this flag is not set, 
               the exclusion flags SHOULD also be respected for the 
               processing node.  

            0x08 = Penultimate node exception 

               This flag is used to indicate that the penultimate node 
               may be shared even when sharing of the said node 
               violates the exclusion flags. When this flag is not set, 
               the exclusion flags SHOULD also be respected for the 
               penultimate node.  

        Exclusion Flags  
         
             The Exclusion-Flags are used to communicate desirable 
             types of exclusion. The following flags are defined.

             0x01 = SRLG exclusion 
               
                  This flag is used to indicate that the route of the 
                  LSP being signaled is requested to be SRLG diverse 
                  from the route of the LSP or tunnel specified by the 
                  LSP subobject.  
                   
                   
             0x02 = Node exclusion 
              
                  This flag is used to indicate that the route of the 
                  LSP being signaled is requested to be node diverse 
                  from the route of the LSP or tunnel specified by the 
                  LSP subobject. The node exclusion is subobject to the 
                  setting of the "Processing node exception", the 
                  "Penultimate node exception" and the "Destination 
                  node exception" Attribute Flags.  

             0x04 = Link exclusion 
              
                  This flag is used to indicate that the route of the 
                  LSP being signaled is requested to be link diverse 
                  from the route of the LSP or tunnel specified by the 
                  LSP subobject.  
       
      The remaining fields are as defined in [RFC3209].

             1 indicates that the attribute specified SHOULD be 
             avoided.  
    
        Type  
         
             IPv6 Point-to-Point LSP subobject 
                       (to be assigned by IANA suggested value: 36). 
         

        Length 

            The length contains the total length of the subobject in 
            bytes, including the type and length fields. The length is 
            always 48. 

      The Attribute Flags and Exclusion Flags are as defined for the 
      IPv4 Point-to-Point LSP subobject. 

      The remaining fields are as defined in [RFC3209]. 
       
    
   2.3. Processing rules for the LSP subobject 

      XRO processing as described in [RFC4874] is unchanged. 

      If the node is the destination for the LSP being signaled, it 
      SHOULD NOT process a LSP XRO subobject. 

      If the L-flag is not set, the processing node follows the 
      following procedure:  

      -  The processing node MUST ensure that any route calculated for 
         the signaled LSP (LSP2) respects the requested exclusion flags 
         with respect to the route traversed by the LSP(s) referenced by 
         the LSP subobject (LSP1/TUNNEL1), including local resources.  

      -  If the processing node fails to find a route that meets the 
         requested constraint, the processing node SHOULD return a 
         PathErr with the error code "Routing Problem (24)" and error 
         value "Route blocked by Exclude Route (67)".   

      -  If the route of the LSP or tunnel (LSP1/TUNNEL1) referenced in 
         the LSP subobject is unknown to the processing node, the 
         processing node SHOULD ignore the LSP subobject in the XRO and 
         SHOULD proceed with the signaling request (for LSP2). However, 
    
    
   Ali, Swallow, Filsfils, et al   Expires January 2013       [Page 10] 
       






         Internet Draft      draft-ali-ccamp-xro-lsp-subobject-02.txt 


         in this case, after sending Resv for LSP2, the processing node 
         SHOULD return a PathErr with the error code "Notify Error (25)" 
         and error value "Route of XRO LSP unknown (value: to be 
         assigned by IANA, suggest value: 13)" for LSP2.  

      -  If latter, the route of the LSP or tunnel (LSP1/TUNNEL1) 
         referenced in the LSP subobject becomes known (e.g. when LSP1 
         is signaled) or the TUNNEL1 is re-optimized to a different 
         route, such that the requested exclusion/ diversity constraints 
         are no longer satisfied and a path that can satisfy the 
         requested constraints exists, the node calculating or expanding 
         the path SHOULD send a PathErr message for LSP2 with the error 
         code "Notify Error (25)" and error value "Preferable path 
         exists (6)". An ingress node receiving this error code/value 
         combination MAY try to reoptimize the LSP2 to the new preferred 
         path. 

      -  Route computation for the LSP or tunnel (LSP1/ TUNNEL1) 
         referenced in the LSP subobject for new setup or for re-
         optimization LSP SHOULD be performed to avoid situation where 
         the requested exclusion/ diversity constraints are no longer 
         satisfied and a path that can satisfy the requested constraints 
         does not exist. However, if such situation arises the node that 
         computed or expanded the route for LSP2 SHOULD send a PathErr 
         message for LSP2 with the error code "Routing Problem (24)" and 
         error value "Route blocked by Exclude Route (67)".   

      If the L-flag is set, the processing node follows the following 
      procedure:  

      -  The processing node SHOULD respect the requested exclusion 
         flags with respect to the route traversed by the referenced 
         LSP(s) (LSP1/TUNNEL1) as far as possible.  

      -  If the processing node fails to find a route that meets the 
         requested constraint, it SHOULD proceeds with a suitable route 
         that best meets the constraint, but after completion of 
         signaling setup, it SHOULD return a PathErr code "Notify Error 
         (25)" and error value "Failed to respect Exclude Route (value: 
         to be assigned by IANA, suggest value: 14)" to the ingress 
         node.  

      -  If the route of the LSP or tunnel (LSP1/TUNNEL1) referenced in 
         the LSP subobject is unknown to the processing node, the 
         processing node SHOULD ignore the LSP subobject in XRO and 
         SHOULD proceed with the signaling request (for LSP2). However, 
         in this case, after sending Resv for LSP2, the processing node

         Internet Draft      draft-ali-ccamp-xro-lsp-subobject-02.txt 


         SHOULD return a PathErr with the error code "Notify Error" and 
         error value "Route to XRO LSP unknown" for LSP2.  

      -  If latter, the route of the LSP or tunnel (LSP1/TUNNEL1) 
         referenced in the LSP subobject becomes known (e.g. when LSP1 
         is signaled) or the TUNNEL1 is re-optimized to a different 
         route, such that the requested exclusion/ diversity constraints 
         are no longer satisfied and a path that can satisfy the 
         requested constraints exists, the node calculating or expanding 
         the path SHOULD send a PathErr message for LSP2 with the error 
         code "Notify Error (25)" and error value "Preferable path 
         exists". An ingress node receiving this error code/value 
         combination MAY try to reoptimize the LSP2 to the new preferred 
         path.  

      -  Route computation for the LSP or tunnel (LSP1/ TUNNEL1) 
         referenced in the LSP subobject for new setup or for re-
         optimization LSP SHOULD be performed to avoid situation where 
         the requested exclusion/ diversity constraints are no longer 
         satisfied and a path that can satisfy the requested constraints 
         does not exist. However, if such situation arises the node that 
         computed or expanded the route for LSP2 SHOULD send a PathErr 
         message for LSP2 with the error code "Notify Error" and error 
         value "Failed to respect Exclude Route".   

      The following rules apply equally to L = 0 and L = 1 case:  

      -  XRO object MAY contain multiple LSP subobjects. In this case, 
         the processing node A node receiving a Path message carrying an 
         XRO MAY reject the message if the XRO is too large or 
         complicated for the local implementation or the rules of local 
         policy, as per the roles of XRO defined in [RFC4874].  In this 
         case, the node   MUST send a PathErr message with the error 
         code "Routing Error" and error value "XRO Too Complex".  An 
         ingress node receiving this error code/value combination MAY 
         reduce the complexity of the XRO or route around the node that 
         rejected the XRO. 

      -  An ingress node receiving PathErr with the error code "Notify 
         Error" and error values "Route to XRO LSP unknown" or "Failed 
         to respect Exclude Route" MAY take no action other than simply 
         logging these notifications. 

      Note that LSP1 may be signaled with an XRO LSP subobject 
      referencing CircuitID2 (LSP2 FEC) and LSP2 may be signaled with 
      an XRO LSP subobject referencing CircuitID1 (LSP1 FEC). The 
      above-mentioned processing rules cover this case. In fact, if

      "LSP ID to be ignored" attribute flag is set when LSP1 is 
      signaled with an XRO LSP subobject referencing CircuitID2, it is 
      RECOMMENDED that LSP2 is signaled with an XRO LSP subobject 
      referencing CircuitID1.  

   2.4. LSP Subobject in Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS) 

      [RFC4874] defines an ERO subobject called Explicit Exclusion 
      Route Subobject (EXRS). An EXRS is used to identify abstract 
      nodes or resources that must not or should not be used on the 
      path between two inclusive abstract nodes or resources in the 
      explicit route. An EXRS contains one or more subobjects of its 
      own, called EXRS subobjects [RFC4874]. 

      An EXRS MAY include an IPv4 Point-to-Point (P2P) LSP subobject. 
      In this case, EXRS would look as follows: 

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |          Must Be Zero         |     Tunnel ID                 | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                       Extended Tunnel ID                      |

      |          Must Be Zero         |            LSP ID             | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       

      The meaning of respective fields in EXRS header is as defined in 
      [RFC4874]. Similarly, the meaning of respective fields in IPv4 
      P2P LSP subobject is as defined earlier in this document. This is 
      with the exceptions that:  

      -  Processing node exception applies to the node processing the 
         ERO.

         Internet Draft      draft-ali-ccamp-xro-lsp-subobject-02.txt 


      -  If L bit in the ERO header is not set (ERO.L = 0), the IPv4 
         P2P LSP subobject is processed against the LSPs for which the 
         processing node is ingress, egress or a transit node. 

      -  Penultimate node exception applies to the penultimate node of 
         the loose hop. This flag is only processed if EXRS.L bit is 
         set, i.e., in the loose ERO hop case.  

      -  Destination node exception applies to the abstract node to 
         which the route is expanded. This flag is only processed if 
         EXRS.L bit is set, i.e., in the loose ERO hop case.  

   2.4.1. Processing Rules for the EXRS with LSP subobject  

      Processing rules for the EXRS object are same as processing rules 
      as described in [RFC4874]. When the EXRS contains one or more LSP 
      subobject(s), processing rule specified in Section 2.3 applies to 
      the node processing the ERO with EXRS subobject.  

   3. Security Considerations 

      This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
      above those identified in [RFC5920], [RFC2205], [RFC3209], and 
      [RFC3473] and [RFC4874].  

   4. IANA Considerations 

   4.1. New XRO subobject type 

      This document introduces a new subobject for the EXCLUDE_ROUTE 
      object [RFC4874], C-Type 1.  
                       
      Subobject Type                             Subobject Description

      To be assigned by IANA (suggest value: 36) IPv4 P2P LSP subobject 
       
   4.2. New EXRS subobject type 

      IPv4 P2P LSP subobject is also defined as a new EXRS subobject.  
       
   4.3. New RSVP error sub-code  

      For Error Code = 25 "Notify Error" (see [RFC3209]) the following 
      sub-code is defined.
