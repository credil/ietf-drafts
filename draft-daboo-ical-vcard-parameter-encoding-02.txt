Internet-Draft             Parameter Encoding               October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] specification defines a standard way to
   describe calendar data.  The vCard [RFC6350] specification defines a
   standard way to describe contact data.  Both of these use a similar
   text-based data format.  Each iCalendar and vCard data object can
   include "properties" which have "parameters" and a "value".  The
   value of a "parameter" is typically a token or URI value, but a
   "generic" text value is also allowed.  However, the syntax rules for
   both iCalendar and vCard prevent the use of a double-quote character
   or control characters in such values, though double-quote and some
   subset of control characters are allowed in the actual property
   values.

   As more and more extensions are being developed for these data
   formats, there is a need to allow at least double-quotes and line
   feeds to be included in parameter values.  The \-escaping mechanism
   used for property text values is not defined for use with parameter
   values and cannot be easily used in a backwards compatible manner.
   This specification defines a new character escaping mechanism,
   compatible with existing parsers and chosen to minimise any impact on
   existing data.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Parameter Value Encoding Scheme

   This specification defines the ^ character (U+005E - Circumflex
   Accent) as an escape character in parameter values whose value type
   is defined using the "param-value" syntax element (Section 3.1 of
   iCalendar [RFC5545] and Section 3.3 of vCard [RFC6350]).  The
   ^-escaping mechanism can be used when the value is either unquoted or
   quoted (i.e., whether or not the value is surrounded by double-
   quotes).  When used, the combination of ^ plus one other character is
   interpreted as a single character as per the table below:

           +---------------------+----------------------------+
           | Escape Sequence     | Character                  |
           +---------------------+----------------------------+
           | ^' (U+005E, U+0027) | U+0022 (Quotation Mark)    |
           | ^n (U+005E, U+006E) | U+000A (Line Feed)         |
           | ^^ (U+005E, U+005E) | U+005E (Circumflex Accent) |
           +---------------------+----------------------------+

   When generating iCalendar or vCard parameter values, the characters
   in the second column above MUST be escaped using the sequence from
   the first column.  When parsing iCalendar or vCard parameter values,
   the two character sequence from the first column MUST be replaced by
   the single character from the second column.  If a ^ (U+005E)
   character is followed by any other character than the ones above,
   parsers SHOULD leave the ^ character in place.

   In addition to the escaping procedure outlined above, text parameter
   values MUST also have line break character sequences canonicalized
   into a single line feed (U+000A) character when the parameter value
   is generated.  Specifically, any single carriage return character
   (U+000D) or the two character combination of carriage return followed
   by line feed (U+000D, U+000A) MUST be mapped to ^n in the generated
   parameter value.  When parsing a parameter value with ^n, clients can
   replace that with the appropriate line break character sequence for
   the system they are running on.

3.1.  iCalendar Example

   An "ATTENDEE" property with a "CN" parameter whose value includes two
   double-quote characters.  The parameter value is not quoted as there
   are no characters in the value that would trigger quoting as required
   by iCalendar.

   ATTENDEE;CN=George Herman ^'Babe^' Ruth:mailto:babe@example.com

   The unescaped parameter value is

   George Herman "Babe" Ruth

3.2.  vCard Examples

   A "GEO" property with a "X-ADDRESS" parameter whose value includes
   several line feed characters.  The parameter value is also quoted
   since it contains a comma which triggers quoting as required by
   vCard.

   GEO;X-ADDRESS="Pittsburgh Pirates^n115 Federal St^nPitt
    sburgh, PA 15212":geo:40.446816,-80.00566

   The unescaped parameter value is (where each line is terminated by a
   line break character sequence)

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security issues beyond those of iCalendar
   [RFC5545] and vCard [RFC6350].


5.  IANA Considerations

   There are none.

Appendix A.  Choice of Quoting Mechanism

   Having recognized the need for escaping parameters values, the
   question is what mechanism to use?  One obvious choice would be to
   adopt the \-escaping used for property values.  However, that could
   not be used as-is, because it escapes a double-quote as the sequence
   of \ followed by double-quote.  Consider what the example in
   Section 3.1 might look like using \-escaping:

   ATTENDEE;CN="George Herman \"Babe\" Ruth":mailto:babe@example.com

Internet-Draft             Parameter Encoding               October 2012


   Existing iCalendar/vCard parsers know nothing about escape sequences
   in parameters.  So they would parse the parameter value as:

   George Herman \

   i.e. the text between the first and second occurrence of a double-
   quote.  However, the text after the second double-quote ought to be
   either a : or a ; (to delimit the parameter value from the following
   parameter or property) but is not - so the parser could legitimately
   throw an error at that point because the data is syntactically
   invalid.  Thus for backwards compatibility reasons, a double-quote
   cannot be escaped using a sequence that itself includes a double-
   quote.  Hence the choice of using a single-quote in this
   specification.

   Another option would be to use a form of \-escaping modified for use
   in parameter values only.  However, some incorrect, non-interoperable
   use of \ in parameter values has been observed, and thus it is best
   to steer clear of that to achieve guaranteed, reliable
   interoperability.  Also, given that double-quote gets changed to
   single-quote in the escape sequence for a parameter, but not for a
   value, it is better to not give the impression that the same escape
   mechanism (and thus code) can be used for both (which could lead to
   other issues such as an implementations incorrectly escaping a ; as
   \; as opposed to quoting the parameter value).

   The choice of ^ as the escape character was made based on the
   requirement that an ASCII symbol (non-alphanumeric) character be
   used, and it ought to be one least likely to be found in existing
   data.
