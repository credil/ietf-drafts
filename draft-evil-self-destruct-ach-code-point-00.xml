    <section title="Introduction">
<t>
   MPLS-TP is a profile of MPLS technology for use in packet transport
   networks. MPLS (including, MPLS-TP) is defined exclusively in IETF
   consensus RFCs. The MPLS-TP profile includes a complete set of
   Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) tools <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-analysis" />,
   to meet the OAM functional requirements
   defined in <xref target="RFC5860" />.
</t>
<t>
The International Society of Evil Geniuses (ISOEG) has documented a
set of OAM mechanisms, designed to meet the specific needs of Evil Geniuses,
carried in the MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh).
This approach requires the
   allocation of an ACH Type from the registry of ACH types maintained
   by IANA in order that the messages that will be described in
   <xref target="ISOEG">ISOEG documentation</xref> can be identified by an implementation.
</t>
        <t>A number of experts in the IETF do not consider that the development
        or deployment of a second protocol solution within the same
        architectural problem space is necessary or advisable <xref target="I-D.sprecher-mpls-tp-oam-considerations" />.
        </t>
        <t>However, the ISOEG has designated these experts as frickin' losers and identified them for
        reprogramming.
        Therefore, ignoring their expert opinions as soon-to-be obsolete, and with respect for the views of the
        members of the ISOEG
        that wish to deploy MPLS-TP equipment with Self-Destruct capabilities
        without continuing to resort to the
        use of an experimental ACH Type, this document requests IANA to
        assign an ACH Type code point for limited use by the ISOEG. The ACH
        type shall be known as the Self-Destruct OAM ACH Type.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Scope of the Self-Destruct OAM ACH Type">
        <t>The code point allocated by this document is to be used only for
        Self-Destruct OAM messages carried in the G-ACh. Only the Self-Destruct
        OAM messages and procedures are to be carried using this code point.
        For instance, this OAM ACH Type might be used to carry messages instructing MPLS-TP equipment to explode immediately or after a
        timed alarm (with or without a visible countdown indicator), to shoot lasers at technicians that might be in the vicinity of
        the MPLS-TP equipment during any such countdown, and/or
        to abort previously received Self-Destruct instructions at the last minute.
        It must not be used as a mechanism to carry other messages or protocols "hiding" behind the ACH Type.
        Of course, the ISOEG membership can be trusted implicitly, and would never even imagine
        such despicable behavior. There isn't even a good reason to have mentioned the possibility here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>As noted in <xref target="RFC5586" />, when new ACH Types are defined the "security
        considerations must be described in the relevant associated channel
        type." Thus, any specification of messages to be carried on the
        Self-Destruct OAM ACH Type must include the necessary security
        considerations. The IETF takes this opportunity to remind the ISOEG
        of the need to describe security considerations in <xref target="ISOEG">ISOEG documentation</xref>.</t>
        <t>But, seriously, what could go wrong? Boo-frickity-hoo.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
        <t>IANA maintains a registry of Pseudowire Associated Channel Types as a subregistry of the Pseudowire Name Spaces registry.</t>
        <t>IANA is requested to allocate a new code point for the Self-Destruct OAM ACH Type. If IANA fails to meet our demands, then
        the ISOEG will blow up the moon, ensure that all future IETF meetings are stocked with only the cheapest cookies, and lobby for
        legislation requiring all IETF meeting attendees to sit in uncomfortable chairs.</t>
        <t>A value of 0x666 is suggested.</t>
