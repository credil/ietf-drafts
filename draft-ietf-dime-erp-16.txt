     Diameter Support for the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)
                       draft-ietf-dime-erp-16.txt

Abstract

   The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) defines extensions to the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to support efficient re-
   authentication between the peer and an EAP Re-authentication (ER)
   server through a compatible authenticator.  This document specifies
   Diameter support for ERP.  It defines a new Diameter ERP application
   to transport ERP messages between an ER authenticator and the ER
   server, and a set of new AVPs that can be used to transport the
   cryptographic material needed by the re-authentication server.

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application           December 2012


1.  Introduction

   Cao, et al. [RFC6696] defines the EAP Re-authentication Protocol
   (ERP).  It consists of the following steps:

   Bootstrapping

      A root key for re-authentication is derived from the Extended
      Master Session Key (EMSK) created during EAP authentication
      [RFC5295].  This root key is transported from the EAP server to
      the ER server.

   Re-authentication

      A one-round-trip exchange between the peer and the ER server,
      resulting in mutual authentication.  To support the EAP
      reauthentication functionality, ERP defines two new EAP codes -
      EAP-Initiate and EAP-Finish.

   This document defines how Diameter transports the ERP messages during
   the re-authentication process.  For this purpose, we define a new
   Application Identifier for ERP, and re-use the Diameter EAP commands
   (DER/DEA).

   This document also discusses the distribution of the root key during
   bootstrapping, in conjunction with either the initial EAP
   authentication (implicit bootstrapping) or the first ERP exchange
   (explicit bootstrapping).  Security considerations for this key
   distribution are detailed in Salowey, et al. [RFC5295].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in Aboba, et al.  [RFC3748],
   Salowey, et al. [RFC5295], Cao, et al. [RFC6696], and Eronen, et
   al. [RFC4072].

   The re-athentication Domain-Specific Root Key (rDSRK) is a re-
   authentication Root Key (rRK, [RFC6696]) derived from the DSRK
   instead of the EMSK.

   "Root key" (RK) or "bootstrapping material" refer to the rRK or rDSRK
   derived from an EMSK, depending on the location of the ER server in
   home or foreign domain.

   We use the notation "ERP/DER" and "ERP/DEA" in this document to refer
   to Diameter-EAP-Request and Diameter-EAP-Answer commands with the
   Application Id set to <Diameter ERP Application> Section 10.1; the
   same commands are denoted "EAP/DER" and "EAP/DEA" when the

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application           December 2012


   Application Id in the message is set to <Diameter EAP Application>
   [RFC4072].

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Assumptions

   This document assumes the existence of at most one logical ER server
   entity in a domain.  If several physical servers are deployed for
   robustness, a replication mechanism must be deployed to synchronize
   the ERP state (e.g., root keys) between these servers.  Any such
   replication mechanism is outside the scope of this document.  If
   multiple ER servers are deployed in the domain, we assume that they
   can be used interchangeably.  If multiple ER servers are deployed
   across the domains, we assume only one ER server that is near the
   peer is involved in ERP.

   This document also assumes the existence of at most one EAP server
   entity in the home domain.  In case of multiple physical home EAP
   servers in the same domain, if the ER server wants to reach the same
   home EAP server, the ER server may cache the Destination-Host AVP
   corresponding to the home EAP server it requests.

4.  Protocol Overview

   The following figure illustrates the components involved in ERP and
   their interactions.

                     Figure 1: Diameter ERP Overview.

   The ER server is located either in the home domain (same as EAP
   server) or in the visited domain (same as authenticator, when it
   differs from the home domain).

   When the peer initiates an ERP exchange, the authenticator creates a
   Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message [RFC4072].  The Application Id of
   the message is set to that of the Diameter ERP application



Bournelle, et al.         Expires June 14, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application           December 2012


   Section 10.1 in the message.  The generation of the ERP/DER message
   is detailed in Section 6.

   If there is an ER server in the same domain as the authenticator
   (i.e., the local domain), Diameter routing MUST be configured so that
   this ERP/DER message reaches that server, even if the Destination-
   Realm is not the same as local domain.

   If there is no local ER server, the message is routed according to
   its Destination-Realm AVP content, extracted from the realm component
   of the keyName-NAI attribute.  As specified in RFC 6696, this realm
   is the home domain of the peer in the case of bootstrapping exchange
   ('B' flag is set in ERP message) or the domain of the bootstrapped ER
   server otherwise .

   If no ER server is available in the home domain either, the ERP/DER
   message cannot be delivered, and an error DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER
   MUST be generated as specified in [RFC6733] and returned to the
   authenticator.  The authenticator MAY cache this information (with
   limited duration) to avoid further attempts to execute ERP with this
   realm.  It MAY also fallback to full EAP authentication to
   authenticate the peer.

   When an ER server receives the ERP/DER message, it searches its local
   database for a valid, unexpired root key matching the keyName part of
   the User-Name AVP.  If such key is found, the ER server processes the
   ERP message as described in RFC 6696, then creates the ERP/DEA answer
   as described in Section 6.  The rMSK is included in this answer.

   Finally, the authenticator extracts the rMSK from the ERP/DEA as
   described in RFC 6696, and forwards the content of the EAP-Payload
   AVP, the EAP-Finish/Re-Auth message, to the peer.

   The ER server may or may not possess the root key in its local
   database.  If the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth message has its 'B' flag set
   (Bootstrapping exchange) and the ER server possesses the root key,
   the ER server SHOULD respond directly to the peer that initiated the
   ERP exchange.  Otherwise, the ER server SHOULD act as a proxy and
   forward the message to the home EAP server after changing its
   Application Id to Diameter EAP and adding the ERP-RK-Request AVP to
   request the root key.  See Section 5 for more detail on this process.

5.  Bootstrapping the ER Server

   The bootstrapping process involves the home EAP server and the ER
   server, but also impacts the peer and the authenticator.  In ERP, the
   peer must derive the same keying material as the ER server.  To
   achieve this, it must learn the domain name of the ER server.  How

   this information is acquired is outside the scope of this
   specification, but the authenticator might be configured to advertize
   this domain name, especially in the case of re-authentication after a
   handover.

   The bootstrapping of an ER server with a given root key happens
   either during the initial EAP authentication of the peer when the
   EMSK -- from which the root key is derived -- is created, during the
   first re-authentication, or sometime between those events.  We only
   consider the first two possibilities in this specification, in the
   following sub-sections.

5.1.  Bootstrapping During the Initial EAP authentication

   Bootstrapping the ER server during the initial EAP authentication
   (also known as implicit bootstrapping) offers the advantage that the
   server is immediately available for re-authentication of the peer,
   thus minimizing the re-authentication delay.  On the other hand, it
   is possible that only a small number of peers will use re-
   authentication in the visited domain.  Deriving and caching key
   material for all the peers (for example, for the peers that do not
   support ERP) is a waste of resources and should be avoided.

   To achieve implicit bootstrapping, the ER server acts as a Diameter
   EAP Proxy , and Diameter routing MUST be configured so that Diameter
   EAP application messages are routed through this proxy.  The figure
   bellow illustrates this mechanism.

        Figure 2: ERP Bootstrapping During Full EAP Authentication

   The authenticator creates the first DER of the full EAP
   authentication and sends it to the ER server.  The ER server proxies
   the first DER of the full EAP authentication and adds the ERP-RK-
   Request AVP inside, then forwards the request to the home EAP server.

   If the home Diameter server does not support the Diameter ERP
   extensions, it simply ignores the ERP-RK-Request AVP and continues as
   specified in RFC 4072 [RFC4072].  If the server supports the ERP
   extensions, it saves the value of the ERP-Realm AVP found inside the
   ERP-RK-Request AVP, and continues with the EAP authentication.  When
   the authentication completes, if it is successful and the EAP method
   has generated an EMSK, the server MUST derive the rRK as specified in
   RFC 6696, using the saved domain name.  It then includes the rRK
   inside a Key AVP (Section 8.3) with the Key-Type AVP set to rRK,
   before sending the DEA as usual.

   When the ER server proxies a Diameter-EAP-Answer message with a
   Session-Id corresponding to a message to which it added an ERP-RK-
   Request AVP, and the Result-Code is DIAMETER_SUCCESS, it MUST examine
   the message and save and remove any Key AVP (Section 8.3) with Key-
   Type AVP set to rRK.  If the message does not contain such Key AVP,



Bournelle, et al.         Expires June 14, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application           December 2012


   the ER server may cache the information that ERP is not possible for
   this session to avoid possible subsequent attempts.  In any case, the
   information stored in ER server concerning a session should not have
   a lifetime greater than the EMSK for this session.

   If the ER server is successfully bootstrapped, it should also add the
   ERP-Realm AVP after removing the Key AVP with Key-Type of rRK in the
   EAP/DEA message.  This ERP-Realm information can be used by the
   authenticator to notify the peer that ER server is bootstrapped, and
   for which domain.  How this information can be transmitted to the
   peer is outside the scope of this document.  This information needs
   to be sent to the peer if both implicit and explicit bootstrapping
   mechanisms are possible, because the ERP message and the root key
   used for protecting this message are different in bootstrapping
   exchanges and non-bootstrapping exchanges.

5.2.  Bootstrapping During the First Re-authentication

   Bootstrapping the ER server during the first re-authentication (also
   known as explicit bootstrapping) is only needed when there is no
   local ER server in the visited domain and there is an ER server in
   the home domain.  It is less resource-intensive, since the EMSK
   generated during initial EAP authentication is reused to derive root
   keys.  On the other hand, the first re-authentication requires a one-
   round-trip exchange with the home EAP server, since the EMSK is
   generated during the initial EAP authentication and never leaves the
   home EAP server, which is less efficient than implicit bootstrapping.

   The EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message is sent to the home ER server.  The
   home ER server receives the ERP/DER message containing the EAP-
   Initiate/Re-Auth message with the 'B' flag set.  It creates the new
   EAP/DER message using the received DRP/DER message and performs the
   following processing:

      Set the Application Id in the header of the message to <Diameter
      EAP Application> [RFC4072]

      Extract the ERP-RK-Request AVP from the ERP/DER message, which
      contains the name of the domain where the ER server is located and
      add it to the newly created ERP/DER message.

   Then the newly created EAP/DER is sent and routed to the home
   Diameter EAP application server.

   If the home Diameter EAP server does not support ERP extensions, EAP
   packets with an unknown ERP-specific code (EAP-Initiate) will not be
   understood.  In such a case, the home Diameter EAP server MUST send
   an EAP/DEA with a Result-Code indicating a Permanent Failure (for



Bournelle, et al.         Expires June 14, 2013                 [Page 8]

   example, DIAMETER_ERROR_EAP_CODE_UNKNOWN or
   DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY).  The Failed-AVP AVP MUST be included and
   contain a copy of the EAP-Payload AVP.  Otherwise, it processes the
   DSRK request as described in RFC 6696.  In particular, it includes
   the Domain- Name TLV attribute with the content from the ERP-Realm
   AVP.  The server creates the EAP/DEA reply message [RFC4072]
   including an instance of the Key AVP (Section 8.3) with Key-Type AVP
   set to rRK and an instance of the Domain-Name TLV attribute with the
   content from the ERP-Realm AVP.

   The ER server receives this EAP/DEA and proxies it as follows, in
   addition to standard proxy operations:

      Set the Application Id back to Diameter ERP Application Id
      (Section 10.1)

      Extract and cache the content of the Key AVP with Key-Type set to
      rRK, as described in Section 5.1).

   The ERP/DEA message is then forwarded to the authenticator, that can
   use the rMSK as described in RFC 6696.

   The figure below captures this proxy behavior:

6.  Re-Authentication

   This section describes in detail a re-authentication exchange with an
   ER server that was previously bootstrapped.  The following figure
   summarizes the re-authentication exchange.

                                                       ER server
    Peer                 Authenticator                (bootstrapped)

    [ <------------------------          ]
    [optional EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-start,]
    [  possibly with ERP domain name     ]

                              EAP-Payload: EAP-Initiate/Re-auth

                              <===============================
                                 Diameter ERP, cmd code DEA
                               EAP-Payload: EAP-Finish/Re-auth
                                        Key AVP: rMSK
      <----------------------
         EAP-Finish/Re-auth

             Figure 4: Diameter ERP Re-authentication Exchange

   The peer sends an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message to the ER server via
   the authenticator.  Alternatively, the authenticator may send an EAP-
   Initiate/Re-auth-Start message to the peer to trigger the mechanism.
   In this case, the peer responds with an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message.

   If the authenticator does not support ERP (pure Diameter EAP
   [RFC4072] support), it discards the EAP packets with an unknown ERP-
   specific code (EAP-Initiate).  The peer should fallback to full EAP
   authentication in this case.

   When the authenticator receives an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message from
   the peer, the message is processed as described in RFC 6696 with
   regard to the EAP state machine.  It creates a Diameter ERP/DER
   message following the general process of Diameter EAP [RFC4072], with
   the following differences:

      The Application Id in the header is set to <Diameter ERP> (code
      TBD1).

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application           December 2012


      The value in Auth-Application-Id AVP is also set to <Diameter
      ERP>.

      The keyName-NAI attribute from the ERP message is used to create
      the content of the User-Name and Destination-Realm AVPs.

      The Auth-Request-Type AVP content is set to the appropriate value.

      The EAP-Payload AVP contains the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth message.

   Then this ERP/DER message is sent as described in Section 4.

   The ER server receives and processes this request as described in
   Section 4.  It then creates an ERP/DEA message following the general
   process described in Eronen, et al. [RFC4072], with the following
   differences:

      The Application Id in the header is set to <Diameter ERP> (code
      TBD1).

      The value of the Auth-Application-Id AVP is also set to <Diameter
      ERP>.

      The EAP-Payload AVP contains the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message.

      If authentication is successful, an instance of the Key AVP
      containing the Re-authentication Master Session Key (rMSK) derived
      by ERP is included.

   When the authenticator receives this ERP/DEA answer, it processes it
   as described in the Diameter EAP Application specification [RFC4072]
   and RFC 6696: the content of the EAP-Payload AVP is forwarded to the
   peer, and the contents of the Keying-Material AVP [RFC6734] is used
   as a shared secret for a secure association protocol specific to the
   lower-layer in use.

7.  Application Id

   We define a new Diameter application in this document, Diameter ERP
   Application, with an Application Id value of TBD1.  Diameter nodes
   conforming to this specification in the role of ER server MUST
   advertise support by including an Auth-Application-Id AVP with a
   value of Diameter ERP in the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
   Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands [RFC6733].

   The primary use of the Diameter ERP Application Id is to ensure
   proper routing of the messages, and that the nodes that advertise the
   support for this application do understand the new AVPs defined in

   Section 8, although these AVP have the 'M' flag cleared.

8.  AVPs

   The following sub-sections discuss the AVPs used by the Diameter ERP
   application.

8.1.  ERP-RK-Request AVP

   The ERP-RK-Request AVP (AVP Code TBD2) is of type grouped AVP.  This
   AVP is used by the ER server to indicate its willingness to act as ER
   server for a particular session.

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

         ERP-RK-Request ::= < AVP Header: TBD2 >
                            { ERP-Realm }
                          * [ AVP ]

                       Figure 5: ERP-RK-Request ABNF

8.2.  ERP-Realm AVP

   The ERP-Realm AVP (AVP Code TBD3) is of type DiameterIdentity.  It
   contains the name of the realm in which the ER server is located.

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

8.3.  Key AVP

   The Key AVP [RFC6734] is of type "Grouped" and is used to carry the
   rRK or rMSK and associated attributes.  The usage of the Key AVP and
   its constituent AVPs in this application is specified in the
   following sub-sections.

8.3.1.  Key-Type AVP

   The value of the Key-Type AVP MUST be set to 2 for rRK or 3 for rMSK.

8.3.2.  Keying-Material AVP

   The Keying-Material AVP contains the rRK sent by the home EAP server
   to the ER server, in answer to a request containing an ERP-RK-Request
   AVP, or the rMSK sent by the ER server to the authenticator.  How
   this material is derived and used is specified in RFC 6696.

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application           December 2012


8.3.3.  Key-Name AVP

   This AVP contains the EMSKname which identifies the keying material.
   The derivation of this name is specified in RFC 6696.

8.3.4.  Key-Lifetime AVP

   The Key-Lifetime AVP contains the lifetime of the keying material in
   seconds.  It MUST NOT be greater than the remaining lifetime of the
   EMSK from which the material was derived.

9.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This section defines new Result-Code [RFC6733] values that MUST be
   supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to this
   specification.

9.1.  Permanent Failures

   Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category are used to
   inform the peer that the request failed and SHOULD NOT be attempted
   again.

      DIAMETER_ERROR_ EAP_CODE_UNKNOWN (TBD4)

         This error code is used by the Diameter server to inform the
         peer that the received EAP-PAYLOAD AVP contains an EAP packet
         with an unknown EAP code.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA registration of the following new
   elements in the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
   Parameters registries [AAAPARAMS].

10.1.  Diameter Application Identifier

   This specification requires IANA to allocate a new value "Diameter
   ERP" (code: TBD1) in the "Application IDs" registry using the
   "Specification Required" policy [RFC5226]; see Section 11.3 of RFC
   3588 [RFC3588] for further details.

10.2.  New AVPs

   This specification requires IANA to allocate new values from the "AVP
   Codes" registry according to the policy specified in Section 11.1 of
   Fajardo, et al. [RFC6733] for the following AVPs:

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application           December 2012


      ERP-RK-Request (code: TBD2)

      ERP-Realm (code: TBD3)

   These AVPs are defined in Section 8.

10.3.  New Permanent Failures Result-Code AVP Values

   This specification requires IANA to allocate a new value from the
   "Result-Code AVP Values (code 268) - Permanent Failure" registry
   according to the policy specified in Section 11.3.2 of Fajardo, et
   al. [RFC6733] for the following Result-Code:

      DIAMETER_ERROR_EAP_CODE_UNKNOWN (code: TBD4)

   This result-code value is defined in Section 9.

11.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from the following documents apply here:

   o  Eronen, et al. [RFC4072]

   o  Cao, et al. [RFC6696]

   o  Fajardo, et al. [RFC6733]

   o  Zorn, et al. [RFC6734]
