   Identifying Addresses of IPv6 Tunnel Packets at Tunnel Exit-point
               draft-liu-6man-ident-tunnel-packet-addr-00

Abstract

   In the networks where IPv6 tunneling is used, it is not specific
   about how a tunnel end-node identifies the received tunnel packets by
   checking the destination and source addresses.  when the tunnel end-
   node is configured with multiple IPv6 addresses or multiple IPv6
   tunnel instances, such identification is necessary.  This document
   describes the problem and defines the behavior of IPv6 tunnel end-
   nodes about identifying tunnel packets.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 tunneling mechanism [RFC2473] provides support for various
   protocols to work in IPv6-only network.  But when a tunnel end-node
   receives a tunnel packet, it is not specific about whether or not the
   tunnel end-node should identify the tunnel packet by checking the
   destination and source addresses in the packet.  When the tunnel end-
   node is configured with multiple IPv6 tunnel instance, it is also
   undefined how to dispatch the received tunnel packet to each tunnel
   instance.  This document provides a solution to this problem by
   defining the behavior of tunnel end-node on how to identify received
   tunnel packets.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   Acceptable Local Address Set:  A set of one or more IPv6 addresses or
                                  prefixes maintained by a tunnel
                                  instance.  It represents the set of
                                  acceptable IPv6 destination addresses
                                  in the received IPv6 tunnel packets.

                                  Usually it consists of one or more
                                  IPv6 addresses on local interfaces of
                                  the tunnel end-node.

   Acceptable Remote Address Set: A set of one or more IPv6 addresses or
                                  prefixes maintained by a tunnel
                                  instance.  It represents the set of
                                  acceptable IPv6 source addresses in
                                  the received IPv6 tunnel packets.

   Terminology defined in [RFC2473] is used extensively in this
   document.

4.  Problem Statement

   Consider an IPv6 tunnel end-node with multiple IPv6 addresses
   configured on its interface.  One of the IPv6 addresses is chosen as
   the tunnel entry-point node address [RFC2473].  When the tunnel end-
   node receives an IPv6 tunnel packet with its destination address
   other than the tunnel entry-point node address, the tunnel end-node
   either discards it or accepts it.  Section 3.3 of [RFC2473] states
   that:

     "Upon receiving an IPv6 packet destined to an IPv6 address of a
     tunnel exit-point node, its IPv6 protocol layer processes the
     tunnel headers."

   According to this statement, the tunnel end-node ought to accept the
   tunnel packet.  However, when the destination IPv6 address is used to
   distinguish among multiple tunnel instances running in the same
   tunnel end-node, one tunnel packet may be passed to multiple tunnel
   instances, and it may not be the expected result.

   When there are multiple tunnel instances in a tunnel end-node and
   each instance with a separated process engine, it must be decided
   about which tunnel instance(s) to be chosen to process a received
   IPv6 tunnel packet.  As the payload of a IPv6 tunnel packet may be
   various protocols, only 3 items may be used to identify a tunnel
   packet: IPv6 destination address, IPv6 source address, and the
   payload protocol type (the Next Header field in IPv6 tunnel packet).
   The payload protocol type can be used to distinguish between an IPv4
   -in-IPv6 tunnel and an IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel.  The IPv6 source and
   destination address can be used to distinguish among tunnels of the
   same protocol type.

   There are several IPv6 transition mechanisms relies on point-to-
   multipoint IPv6 tunnel, such as DS-Lite [RFC6333], Lightweight 4over6
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6], MAP-E [I-D.ietf-softwire-map], etc.  In

   these mechanisms, one tunnel instance may have multiple remote
   tunnel-ends, each with different IPv6 unicast addresses.  Thus, the
   acceptable destination / source address of a inbound tunnel packet
   could be multiple address.

5.  Tunnel End-node Behavior

5.1.  Acceptable Local/Remote Address Set Maintenance

   An IPv6 tunnel end-node maintains an Acceptable Local Address Set in
   each of its tunnel instance.  An Acceptable Local Address Set
   contains one or more IPv6 addresses or prefixes.  The destination
   address of an inbound IPv6 tunnel packet to be passed to a tunnel
   instance MUST match a record in the Acceptable Local Address Set of
   the tunnel instance.

   An IPv6 tunnel end-node maintains an Acceptable Remote Address Set in
   each of its tunnel instance.  An Acceptable Remote Address Set
   contains one or more IPv6 addresses or prefixes.  The source address
   of an inbound IPv6 tunnel packet to be passed to a tunnel instance
   MUST match a record in the Acceptable Remote Address Set of the
   tunnel instance.

   For example, in a point-to-point IPv6 tunnel, the Acceptable Local
   Address Set contains one IPv6 address(tunnel entry-point node address
   [RFC2473]), and the Acceptable Remote Address Set contains one IPv6
   address(tunnel exit-point node address [RFC2473]).  In the tunnel
   model of DS-Lite AFTR [RFC6333], the Acceptable Remote Address Set
   may contains a IPv6 prefix ::/0, to represent that the tunnel accepts
   tunnel packets from any B4s.

5.2.  Inbound Tunnel Packet Identification

   When an IPv6 tunnel end-node receives an IPv6 tunnel packet, the
   tunnel end-node identifies the packet by comparing its IPv6 source
   address, IPv6 destination address and protocol type (Next Header)
   with the Acceptable Remote Address Set, Acceptable Local Address Set,
   and protocol type of each tunnel instance running on the node.  If
   all the 3 fields match, the IPv6 tunnel packet is passed to the
   tunnel instance.

   If a tunnel packet matches more than one tunnel instance, it is
   passed to each of the tunnel instances.  If a tunnel packet matches
   no tunnel instance, the tunnel end-node MUST discard the packet, and
   SHOULD send a ICMPv6 error message to the source address of the
   tunnel packet.  ICMPv6 type is TBD.
