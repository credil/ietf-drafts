                    Update to the PCP specification
                  draft-cheshire-pcp-unsupp-family-03

Abstract

   The Port Control Protocol allows clients to request mappings in NAT
   gateways and firewalls.  This document specifies the PCP
   UNSUPP_FAMILY error code, which enables PCP servers to inform clients
   when the requested external address family is not supported.  This
   document also removes the requirement for the PCP server to validate
   the mapping nonce, which proved to be unhelpful in practice.

2.  PCP Unsupported Family Error

   The Port Control Protocol [RFC6887] allows clients to request
   mappings in NAT gateways and firewalls.  A client can request a
   mapping to an external IPv6 address or to an external IPv4 address.
   The client signifies which family of external address it desires by
   the type of address it puts into the Suggested External Address
   field.

   If the client wants an external IPv6 address, then it populates the
   Suggested External Address field with a native IPv6 address.  In the
   overwhelmingly common case where the client doesn't know the external
   address when it makes its initial request, this will be the all-zeros
   IPv6 address (::).

   If the client wants an external IPv4 address, then it populates the
   Suggested External Address field with an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   (the first 80 bits set to zero, the next 16 set to one).  In the
   overwhelmingly common case where the client doesn't know the NAT's
   external address when it makes its initial request, this will be the
   all-zeros IPv4 address (::ffff:0:0).

   Note that while the specific address placed in the Suggested External
   Address field is merely a suggestion that the PCP server is free to
   ignore, the address family is not.  If the suggested address cannot
   be provided, another address of the same family SHOULD be provided if
   possible, but if the suggested address *family* cannot be provided by
   this PCP server, it MUST return a PCP error reply containing the
   UNSUPP_FAMILY error code.

   Many gateway devices, particularly early ones, may not be able to
   provide both external address families.  For example, an IPv4-only
   NAT cannot provide an external IPv6 address.

   Even with gateway devices that can support both external address
   families, the ability to provide the an external address of the

   requested family may depend on the family of the client's internal
   address.  For example, a gateway that supports native IPv6, and
   traditional NAT44, but not NAT64, can provide mappings from an
   internal IPv6 address to an external IPv6 address (typically the same
   address when no address translation is being performed), and can
   provide mappings from an internal IPv4 address to an external IPv4
   address, but not mappings from an internal IPv6 address to an
   external IPv4 address.  When such a gateway receives a request to map
   an internal IPv6 address to an external IPv4 address it MUST return
   the UNSUPP_FAMILY error code.

   Note that it is possible and valid for a given internal address and
   port to have two mappings simultaneously, one to an external IPv4
   address and one to an external IPv6 address.  The handling of
   outbound packets is determined by the outbound destination address;
   for example, an outbound IPv6 packet addressed to an IPv6 address in
   the NAT64 gateway's IPv6 address pool is translated to the
   corresponding IPv4 packet before forwarding; an outbound IPv6 packet
   addressed to some other routable IPv6 address is forwarded
   unmodified.

   A client that can handle both IPv6 and IPv4 external addresses MAY
   send two requests, and then determine its behaviour based on the
   responses it receives.  For example, if the client requests and
   receives an IPv6 external address, it may create a DNS AAAA record
   giving that IPv6 address.  If the client requests and receives an
   IPv4 external address, it may create a DNS address record giving that
   IPv4 address.  If the client requests and receives both families of
   external address, it may create both DNS records.  Or, if one
   external address is sufficient for the client, then it MAY first
   request its preferred address family, and only if that fails with an
   UNSUPP_FAMILY error, request the other family.

2.1.  Implications for RFC 6887

   Various sections of the PCP specification [RFC6887] describe clients
   and servers identifying a mapping by examining the three-tuple of
   { internal port, protocol, internal address } in a request or reply.
   For example:

      If the internal port, protocol, and internal address match an
      existing static mapping (which will have no nonce), then a PCP
      reply is sent giving the external address and port of that static
      mapping, using the nonce from the PCP request.  The server does
      not record the nonce.

Internet-Draft                 PCP Update                      June 2013


      It is possible that a mapping might already exist for a requested
      internal address, protocol, and port.  If so, the PCP server takes
      the following actions...

      If no mapping exists for the internal address, protocol, and port,
      and the PCP server is able to create a mapping using the suggested
      external address and port, it SHOULD do so.

      After performing common PCP response processing, the response is
      further matched with a previously sent MAP request by comparing
      the internal IP address (the destination IP address of the PCP
      response, or other IP address specified via the THIRD_PARTY
      option), the protocol, the internal port, and the mapping nonce.
      Other fields are not compared, because the PCP server sets those
      fields.

   Everywhere that RFC 6887 refers to using the "internal port,
   protocol, and internal address" to identify a particular mapping, it
   should be read to mean the four-tuple of
   { int port, protocol, internal address, external address family }.

   PCP clients and servers that only support one external address family
   can continue to use the previous three-tuple
   { internal port, protocol, internal address } to identify a mapping,
   since they only support one external address family, and unilaterally
   reject requests and responses containing the unsupported family.  For
   PCP servers this means rejecting requests containing the unsupported
   address family via the UNSUPP_FAMILY error code.  For PCP clients
   this should be a non-issue because a PCP client should never receive
   a reply containing an external address family it didn't request, but
   should a client receive such a reply from a misbehaving PCP server
   offering an external address family the client did not request, the
   client MUST silently ignore the erroneous reply.

   An implication of this update to the PCP specification is that when
   renewing a mapping, a PCP client MUST include a suggested external
   address of the correct family, so that the gateway device can
   identify which mapping is being renewed.  Ideally a PCP client SHOULD
   record the previously-granted external address and use that as the
   suggested external address in its renewal request, to facilitate
   recovery in the event of gateway state loss, but at the very least a
   PCP client MUST provide an all-zeroes suggested external address of
   the correct family (just as it must have indicated the desired
   address family in its initial request that created the mapping).

3.  New Nonce Check Behavior

   The PCP specification [RFC6887] states that if a client requests a
   mapping (or renews a mapping, which is the same thing, from the
   server's point of view) and the requested mapping already exists, but
   with a different nonce, then the server returns a NOT_AUTHORIZED
   error.

   This has proved to be problematic.  The nonce exists primarily to
   allow the client to validate that the responses it receives from the
   PCP server are legitimate, and have not been fraudulently generated
   by an off-path attacker.  Requiring the PCP server to also verify
   that the nonce matches causes unnecessary failures.

   For example, if a client reboots or otherwise suffers a loss of
   state, it may not have a record of nonces it previously used.
   Suppose this client then requests a mapping from an external IPv4
   address to its internal IP address at TCP port 22, so that it can
   receive ssh logins.  If the same client machine had previously
   requested such a mapping with a different nonce, then the new request
   will fail with a NOT_AUTHORIZED error.  This is unhelpful and
   misleading.  The client does in fact have a mapping.  Incoming
   connection requests to its external address and port will in fact be
   forwarded to it at port 22.  The PCP server is simply refusing to
   tell the client what the external address and port are, hindering the
   client's ability to use the mapping.

   The same scenario also exists in the case where (i) a different
   internal host had previously requested a mapping to its internal port
   22, (ii) that host then left the network, and (iii) the newly vacated
   internal IP address is then assigned to new host.  When this happens,
   the new host will be unable to usefully request a mapping to its
   internal port 22 until the old mapping expires.  The new host will
   actually have a mapping to its internal port 22, and will actually
   receive incoming connection requests arriving at the external address
   and port, but the PCP server will refuse to tell the client what the
   external address and port are, thereby hindering the new host from
   communicating that external address and port to the peer it wishes to
   receive connections from.  This is not helpful.

   This PCP security check does not prevent the new host from learning
   the external address and port by other circuitous means.  For
   example, the new host could discover the external address and port by
   sending outbound traffic a destination it controls, and having that
   destination report back the source address and port.

   Furthermore, this PCP security check is inconsistent with other PCP
   behaviour.  It makes PCP behave differently for explicit dynamic

   versus other kinds of mappings.  Indeed, requests matching static
   mappings are not subjected to the nonce check and will result in a
   response containing the static mapping's current state.  There is no
   reason that MAP requests matching a dynamic mapping should return
   less information.

   Therefore, the nonce check behaviour decribed below MUST be
   implemented instead.

3.1.  Nonce Check for MAP Requests

   If operating in the Simple Threat Model (Section 18.1 of PCP
   specification [RFC6887]), and the internal port, protocol, internal
   address, and external address family match an existing explicit
   dynamic mapping, but the mapping nonce does not match, then the
   existing mapping nonce is updated to the new nonce, the lifetime is
   updated (subject to the PCP server policy for maximum and minimum
   lifetimes) and an appropriate PCP reply is sent, using the new nonce
   and assigned lifetime.

   This specification makes no statement about mapping nonce with the
   Advanced Threat Model.

3.2.  Nonce Check for PEER Requests

   If operating in the Simple Threat Model (Section 18.1 of PCP
   specification [RFC6887]), and the internal port, protocol, internal
   address, and external address family match a mapping that already
   exists, but the mapping nonce does not match (that is, a previous
   PEER request was processed), then the existing mapping nonce is
   updated to the new nonce, the lifetime is updated (subject to the PCP
   server policy for maximum and minimum lifetimes) and an appropriate
   PCP reply is sent, using the new nonce and assigned lifetime.

   This specification makes no statement about mapping nonce with the
   Advanced Threat Model.

3.3.  Returning NOT_AUTHORIZED error

   A NOT_AUTHORIZED error should still be returned, as described in
   Section 15.1 of PCP specification [RFC6887], when a PCP client
   attemps to delete a static mapping (i.e., a mapping created outside
   of PCP itself) or an outbound (implicit or PEER-created) mapping.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should allocate the following PCP Result Code:

   14 UNSUPP_FAMILY: Unsupported external address family, e.g., IPv6 in
      a NAT that handles only IPv4.  This is a long lifetime error.


5.  Security Considerations

   This new error code leaks no sensitive information and creates no new
   security vulnerabilities.
