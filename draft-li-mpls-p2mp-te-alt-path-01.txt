Abstract

   The document proposes a solution to be able to set up the alternative
   path for specific leaf nodes of a P2MP TE LSP.  Corresponding RSVP-TE
   protocol extension is also defined.  The solution is used to cope
   with the issue that in some scenarios traffic loss happens even if
   there exists possible path for the leaf nodes.

Internet-Draft      Alternative Path for P2MP TE LSP        October 2013


   [RFC4461] presents a set of requirements for the establishment and
   maintenance of Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Traffic-Engineered (TE)
   Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).
   [RFC4875] defines extensions to the RSVP-TE protocol for setup of
   P2MP TE LSPs.  P2MP TE LSPs are set up with a series of traffic
   engineering constraints.  These constraints are applied to all S2L
   sub-LSPs.  This may cause the issue that some S2L sub-LSPs can be set
   up while others cannot set up according to the constraints.  There
   may be worse case that some S2L sub-LSPs cannot be restored after
   link failure according to the constraints.  When P2MP TE LSPs are
   used for specific applications, it will cause continuous traffic
   loss.  This document identifies the applicability issue and proposes
   the solution and corresponding protocol extension.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminologies defined in [RFC2205], [RFC3031],
   [RFC3209], [RFC3473], [RFC4090], [RFC4461] and [RFC4875].

3.  Problem Statement

   The P2MP TE LSP is set up with a series of traffic engineering
   constrains such as bandwidth, explicit path, affinity
   property(color), etc.  These traffic engineering constraints are
   applied to path computation for all S2L sub-LSPs.  Owing to the
   network provision some leaves of the P2MP LSP are not reachable
   according to the required constraints (it will be called primary
   constraints in the following text).  There may be the worse case that
   all leaves are reachable at the beginning and they are not reachable
   when failure happens.  In fact in the scenario these leaves can be
   reachable if ignore some or all of the primary constraints .

Internet-Draft      Alternative Path for P2MP TE LSP        October 2013


                                  N    M*******O

                     Figure 1.  Constraints for P2MP TE LSP


   An example for P2MP TE LSP setup is shown in the figure 1.  A is the
   root node and F, N and M are leaf nodes.  The link with '|' means the
   link with red color and the link with '*' means the link with green
   color.  The constraint is that the link with red color should be
   chosen for the path.  For the leaf node M, the path is
   A->B->E->H->K-M. When link between H and K fails, there is no path
   with red color can be found from A to M. This will cause the initial
   available traffic break until the link between H and K restores.  The
   continuous traffic loss can cause bad user experience if the P2MP TE
   LSP is used for IPTV or other applications.  In fact, during the
   course of failure, there is an alternative path from A to M (
   A->B->E->H->I->L->K->M ) if the link with green color can be chosen.

4.  Mechanisms

   In order to solve the above applicability issue for P2MP TE LSP,
   alternative constraints can be specified for the P2MP TE LSP to
   calculate paths to specific leaf nodes if the path with the primary
   constraints is not available.  The P2MP TE LSP is set up with some
   S2L sub-LSPs using the primary constraints while the other S2L sub-
   LSPs using the alternative constraints.  The constraints may be used
   in the downstream nodes, such as ASBR node, and the alternative
   constraints MUST be propagated to keep the consistence through RSVP-
   TE protocol extensions.

4.1.  Path Computation in Root Node

   When alternative constraints is allowed for a specific P2MP TE LSP in
   the root node, the node MUST try to compute paths for all leaf nodes
   using the primary constraints.  If paths with the primary constraints
   are available for all leaf nodes, the alternative constraints MUST
   NOT be used.

   When paths with the primary constraints are not available for
   specific leaf nodes, the alternative constraints SHOULD be used to
   calculate paths for these leaf nodes.  In order to get available
   paths, the alternative constraints should be looser than the primary
   constraints.  The alternative constraints can be set as zero to
   simplify the process and the best-effort path as routing is
   calculated.

   When calculate paths with the alternative constraints, the
   constraints MUST be applied to the whole S2L sub-LSP.  That is, it is

Internet-Draft      Alternative Path for P2MP TE LSP        October 2013


   prohibited that some parts of the S2L sub-LSP satisfies the primary
   constraints while other parts satisfies the alternative constraints.
   If the root node can not calculate the whole S2L sub-LSP ( abstract
   node exists in the calculated path ), the alternative constraints
   MUST be used in the downstream nodes path calculation.

   The root node will keep trying to re-optimize to a better path to
   meet the primary constraints, and it is outside the scope of this
   document.

4.2.  Alternative Constraints Propagation

   When setup P2MP LSP, the primary constraint is carried according to
   the RSVP-TE protocol extension which is defined in [RFC4875].  If the
   paths to specific leaf nodes are computed using alternative
   constraints, the alternative constraints MUST be carried
   corresponding to the S2L sub-LSPs to these leaf nodes in the Path
   message.  These alternative constraints corresponding to S2L sub-LSPs
   are propagated along the paths from the root node to the leaf nodes.

   There are two methods for RSVP-TE protocol to propagate the
   alternative constraints.  One is to propagate alternative constraints
   in separate message from primary constraints.  This method can reuse
   current P2MP RSVP-TE Message, and does not introduce any extension.
   The other method is to propagate primary and alternative constraints
   in single RSVP Message, and need some extension on the Path Message.

   When alternative constraints are received for one or more S2L sub-
   LSPs, they MUST be used when calculating for those S2L sub-LSPs,
   while the primary constraints MUST be used for other S2L sub-LSPs
   without alternative constraints.  This will be described in detail in
   the section 5 and 6.

4.3.  Resource and Label

   When the Resv message is propagated from the leaf nodes to the root
   node, the transit node MUST reserve resource according to the traffic
   parameters specified by the required constraints.  However, the
   common upstream node, such as A, B node in figure 1, may have
   different traffic parameters required if both the primary and
   alternative constraints exist.  But no matter the parameters are same
   or different, all sub-LSPs in one P2MP LSP MUST share the resource
   and use same incoming Label on the common nodes.

5.  Method of Separate Messages

   Propagating alternative constraints through separate messages does
   not need to introduce any extension on RSVP messages based

   on[RFC4875].  However, it needs to change on Path and Resv Message
   processing.  According to [RFC4875], the constraints for all sub-LSPs
   that belongs to one P2MP LSP should be the same.  This document
   introduces that sub-LSPs can have different constraints in the same
   P2MP LSP.  In this case, a node supporting alternative sub-LSPs MUST
   accept such different constraints for local processing and continue
   to propagate them to downstream nodes.  The resource reservation and
   Label processing are as described in Section 4.3.

   Exception for the LSP attributes defined by alternative constraints,
   the S2L sub-LSP descriptors and Sub-Group identifier, the separate
   Path Message has the same objects with other Path messages for same
   P2MP LSP.

   If a node cannot support alternative sub-LSPs, it MUST send PathErr
   Message back to Ingress and stop the establishment for such sub-LSPs.
   But other sub-LSPs with primary constraints SHOULD not be impacted.

6.  Method of Single message

   This method needs to extend Path Message based on [RFC4875] to carry
   both primary and alternative constraints in single message.

6.1.  Path Message Format

   <Path Message> ::=     <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                          [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>] ...]
                          [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                          <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                          <TIME_VALUES>
                          [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]
                          <LABEL_REQUEST>
                          [ <PROTECTION> ]
                          [ <LABEL_SET> ... ]
                          [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ]
                          [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ]
                          [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ]
                          [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                          <sender descriptor>
                          [<S2L sub-LSP descriptor list>]

   The following is the format of the S2L sub-LSP descriptor list.

   <S2L sub-LSP descriptor list> ::= <S2L sub-LSP descriptor>
                                     [ <S2L sub-LSP descriptor list> ]

   <S2L sub-LSP descriptor> ::= <S2L_SUB_LSP>
                                [ <P2MP SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]

Internet-Draft      Alternative Path for P2MP TE LSP        October 2013


                                [ <P2MP SECONDARY_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ]
                                [ <P2MP SECONDARY_SENDER_TSPEC> ]



   In the Path message, S2L_SUB_LSP for specific leaf nodes can carry
   the alternative constraints besides the explicit route . <P2MP
   SECONDARY_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> and <P2MP SECONDARY_SENDER_TSPEC> are
   added to specify the alternative constraints such as resource
   affinity, setup and holding priority and traffic parameters.  The
   format, Class Num and C-Type of <P2MP SECONDARY_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE>
   and <P2MP SECONDARY_SENDER_TSPEC> are all the same as
   <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> defined by [RFC3209] and <SENDER_TSPEC> defined
   by [RFC2210].  The downstream node can judge that the
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE and SENDER_TSPEC objects are for alternative
   constraints of specific S2L sub-LSP when they are placed following
   corresponding S2L_SUB_LSP object.  For convenience, we still use the
   names, P2MP SECONDARY_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE and P2MP
   SECONDARY_SENDER_TSPEC, to represent these two objects for specific
   sub-LSPs.

6.2.  Path Message Processing

   When a node receives a Path Message with P2MP
   SECONDAY_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE and P2MP SECONDARY_SENDER_TSPEC objects
   following one or more S2L_SUB_LSP objects, it can judge that such
   sub-LSPs are alternative sub-LSPs which have attributes identified by
   these two objects.

   If after a branch node, the alternative sub-LSP will become alone,
   then the branch node will signal a new Path Message for that
   alternative sub-LSP in the normal way.  This means, for this new path
   message, the content of P2MP SECONDAY_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE and P2MP
   SECONDARY_SENDER_TSPEC objects will be carried by the primary
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE and SENDER_TSPEC like a normal P2MP Path Message,
   and these two new objects will not be carried any more to downstream
   .  The SUB-Group ID for that path message will also be a new value
   different from the original Primary sub-LSP for the same egress.

   If a transit node cannot support alternative sub-LSPs, it MUST send a
   PathErr Message back to ingress.

6.3.  Other Messages

   The format of Resv Message based on [RFC4875] does not need to be
   modified.  But a new case for Resv Message processing is introduced
   that, a branch node may receive different traffic parameters in
   FLOWSPEC of the same P2MP LSP from different downstream nodes.  It

   MUST calculate the shared resource for resource reservation and carry
   the result as FLOWSPEC to upstream.

   For other RSVP Messages based on [RFC4875], the message format and
   processing have no change.

   This document does not introduce any security issues above those
   identified in[RFC4875].
