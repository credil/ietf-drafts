            Protocol Independent Multicast DR Load Balancing
                       draft-ietf-pim-drlb-01.txt

Abstract

   On a multi-access network such as an Ethernet, one of the PIM routers
   is elected as a Designated Router (DR).  The PIM DR has two roles in
   the PIM protocol.  On the first hop network, the PIM DR is
   responsible for registering an active source to the RP if the group
   is operated in PIM SM.  On the last hop network, the PIM DR is
   responsible for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding
   traffic to these listeners if the group is operated in PIM SM/SSM/DM.
   In this document, we propose a modification to the PIM protocol that
   allows more than one of these last hop routers to be selected so that
   the forwarding load can be distributed to and handled among these
   routers.  A router responsible for forwarding for a particular group
   is called a Group Designated Router (GDR).

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   With respect to PIM, this document follows the terminology that has
   been defined in [RFC4601].

   This document also introduces the following new acronyms:

   o  GDR: GDR stands for "Group Designated Router".  For each multicast
      group, a hash algorithm (described below) is used to select one of
      the routers as GDR.  The GDR is responsible for initiating the
      forwarding tree building for the corresponding group.

   o  GDR Candidate: a last hop router that has potential to become a
      GDR.  A GDR Candidate must have the same DR priority as the DR
      router.  It must send and process received new PIM Hello Options
      as defined in this document.  There might be more than one GDR
      candidate on a LAN.  But only one can become GDR for a specific
      multicast group.


2.  Introduction

   On a multi-access network such as an Ethernet, one of the PIM routers
   is elected as a Designated Router (DR).  The PIM DR has two roles in
   the PIM protocol.  On the first hop network, the PIM DR is
   responsible for registering an active source with the RP if the group
   is operated in PIM SM.  On the last hop network, the PIM DR is
   responsible for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding to
   these listeners if the group is operated in PIM SM/SSM/DM.

   Consider the following last hop network in Figure 1:

                        Figure 1: Last Hop Network

   Assume R1 is elected as the Designated Router.  According to
   [RFC4601], R1 will be responsible for forwarding to the last hop LAN.
   In addition to keeping track of IGMP and MLD membership reports, R1
   is also responsible for initiating the creation of source and/or
   shared trees towards the senders or the RPs.

   Forcing sole data plane forwarding responsibility on the PIM DR
   proves a limitation in the protocol.  In comparison, even though an
   OSPF DR, or an IS-IS DIS, handles additional duties while running the
   OSPF or IS-IS protocols, they are not required to be solely
   responsible for forwarding packets for the network.  On the other
   hand, on a last hop LAN, only the PIM DR is asked to forward packets
   while the other routers handle only control traffic (and perhaps drop
   packets due to RPF failures).  The forwarding load of a last hop LAN
   is concentrated on a single router.

   This leads to several issues.  One of the issues is that the
   aggregated bandwidth will be limited to what R1 can handle towards
   this particular interface.  These days, it is very common that the
   last hop LAN usually consists of switches that run IGMP/MLD or PIM
   snooping.  This allows the forwarding of multicast packets to be
   restricted only to segments leading to receivers who have indicated
   their interest in multicast groups using either IGMP or MLD.  The
   emergence of the switched Ethernet allows the aggregated bandwidth to
   exceed, some times by a large number, that of a single link.  For
   example, let us modify Figure 1 and introduce an Ethernet switch in
   Figure 2.

              Figure 2: Last Hop Network with Ethernet Switch

   Let us assume that each individual link is a Gigabit Ethernet.  Each
   router, R1, R2 and R3, and the switch have enough forwarding capacity
   to handle hundreds of Gigabits of data.

   Let us further assume that each of the hosts requests 500 mbps of
   data and different traffic is requested by each host.  This
   represents a total 1.5 gbps of data, which is under what each switch
   or the combined uplink bandwidth across the routers can handle, even
   under failure of a single router.

   On the other hand, the link between R1 and switch, via port gi0, can
   only handle a throughput of 1gbps.  And if R1 is the only router, the
   PIM DR elected using the procedure defined by RFC 4601, at least 500
   mbps worth of data will be lost because the only link that can be
   used to draw the traffic from the routers to the switch is via gi0.
   In other words, the entire network's throughput is limited by the
   single connection between the PIM DR and the switch (or the last hop
   LAN as in Figure 1).

   The problem may also manifest itself in a different way.  For
   example, R1 happens to forward 500 mbps worth of unicast data to H1,
   and at the same time, H2 and H3 each requests 300 mbps of different
   multicast data.  Once again packet drop happens on R1 while in the
   mean time, there is sufficient forwarding capacity left on R2 and R3
   and link capacity between the switch and R2/R3.

   Another important issue is related to failover.  If R1 is the only
   forwarder on the last hop network, in the event of a failure when R1
   goes out of service, multicast forwarding for the entire network has
   to be rebuilt by the newly elected PIM DR.  However, if there was a
   way that allowed multiple routers to forward to the network for
   different groups, failure of one of the routers would only lead to

   disruption to a subset of the flows, therefore improving the overall
   resilience of the network.

   In this document, we propose a modification to the PIM protocol that
   allows more than one of these routers, called Group Designated Router
   (GDR) to be selected so that the forwarding load can be distributed
   to and handled by a number of routers.


3.  Applicability

   The proposed change described in this specification applies to PIM
   last hop routers only.

   It does not alter the behavior of a PIM DR on the first hop network.
   This is because the source tree is built using the IP address of the
   sender, not the IP address of the PIM DR that sends the registers
   towards the RP.  The load balancing between first hop routers can be
   achieved naturally if an IGP provides equal cost multiple paths
   (which it usually does in practice).  And distributing the load to do
   registering does not justify the additional complexity required to
   support it.


4.  Functional Overview

   In the existing PIM DR election, when multiple last hop routers are
   connected to a multi-access network (for example, an Ethernet), one
   of them is selected to act as PIM DR.  The PIM DR is responsible for
   sending Join/Prune messages to the RP or source.  To elect the PIM
   DR, each PIM router on the network examines the received PIM Hello
   messages and compares its DR priority and IP address with those of
   its neighbors.  The router with the highest DR priority is the PIM
   DR.  If there are many such routers, their IP addresses are used as
   the tie breaker, as described in [RFC4601].

   In order to share forwarding load among last hop routers, besides the
   normal PIM DR election, the GDR is also elected on the last hop
   multi-access network.  There is only one PIM DR on the multi-access
   network, but there might be multiple GDR candidates.

   For each multicast group, a hash algorithm is used to select one of
   the routers to be the GDR.  Hash Masks are defined for Source, Group
   and RP separately, in order to handle different PIM modes.  The masks
   are announced in PIM Hello as a Load Balancing Hash Mask TLV (LBM
   TLV).  Last hop routers with this new TLV and with the same DR
   priority as the PIM DR are GDR candidates.

Internet-Draft           PIMv2 DR Load Balancing              March 2012


   A simple hash algorithm based on the announced Source, Group or RP
   masks allow one GDR to be assigned to a corresponding multicast
   group, and that GDR is responsible for initiating the creation of the
   multicast forwarding tree for the group.

4.1.  GDR Candidates

   GDR is the new concept introduced by this specification.  To become a
   candidate GDR, a router MUST support this specification and also have
   the same DR priority as the DR.  For example, assume there are 4
   routers on the LAN: R1, R2, R3 and R4, which all support this
   specification.  R1, R2 and R3 have the same DR priority while R4's DR
   priority is less preferred.  In this example, only R1, R2 and R3 will
   be eligible for GDR election.  R4 is not because R4 will not become a
   PIM DR unless all of R1, R2 and R3 go out of service.

   Further assume router R1 wins the PIM DR election.  In its Hello
   packet, R1 will include the identity of R1, R2 and R3 (the GDR
   candidates) besides its own Load Balancing Hash Mask TLV.  The order
   of the GDR candidates is converted to the ordinal number associated
   with each GDR candidate.  For example, addresses advertised by R1 is
   R1, R2, R3, the ordinal number assigned to R1 is 0, to R2 is 1 and to
   R3 is 2.

4.2.  Hash Mask

   A Hash Mask is used to extract a number of bits from the
   corresponding IP address field (32 for v4, 128 for v6), and calculate
   a hash value.  A hash value is used to select GDR from GDR Candidates
   advertised in order by PIM DR.  For example, 0.255.0.0 defines a Hash
   Mask for an IPv4 address that masks the first, the third and the
   fourth octets.

   There are three Hash Masks defined,

   o  RP Hash Mask
   o  Source Hash Mask
   o  Group Hash Mask

   The Hash Masks must be configured on the PIM routers that can
   potentially become a PIM DR.

   For ASM groups, a hash value is calculated using the following
   formula:

   o  hashvalue_RP = ((RP_address & RP_hashmask) >> N ) % M

   RP_address is the address of the RP defined for the group.  N is the

Internet-Draft           PIMv2 DR Load Balancing              March 2012


   number of bits that are 0 from the right.  M is the number of GDR
   candidates as described above.

   If RP_hashmask is 0, a hash value is also calculated using the group
   Hash Mask in a similar fashion

   o  hashvalue_Group = ((Group_address & Group_hashmask) >> N) % M

   For SSM groups, a hash value is calculated using both the source and
   group Hash Mask

   o  hashvalue_SG = (((Source_address & Source_hashmask) >> N_S) ^
      ((Group_address & Group_hashmask) >> N_G)) % M

4.3.  PIM Hello Options

   When a non-DR PIM router that supports this specification sends a PIM
   Hello, it includes a new option, called "Load Balancing Hash Masks
   TLV (LBM TLV)".  The LBM TLV consists of three Hash Masks as defined
   above.

   Besides this new LBM TLV, the elected PIM DR router also includes a
   "Load Balancing GDR TLV (LBGDR TLV)" in its PIM Hello.  The LBGDR TLV
   consists of the sorted addresses of all GDR candidates on the last
   hop network.

   The elected PIM DR router uses LBM TLV to calculate its LBGDR TLV.
   The GDR candidates use LBM TLV and LBGDR TLV advertised by DR PIM
   router to calculate hash value.

6.1.  PIM DR Operation

   The DR election process is still the same as defined in [RFC4601].  A
   DR that supports this specification advertises a new Hello Option
   LBGRD TLV to includes all GDR candidates.  Moreover, same as non-DR
   routers, DR also advertises LBM TLV Hello Option to indicate its
   capability of supporting this specification.

   LBGRD TLV is composed by sorting the addresses of all GDR candidates.
   LBM TLV on PIM DR contains value of masks from user configuration.

   If a PIM DR receives a neighbor Hello with LBGRD TLV, the PIM DR
   SHOULD ignore the TLV.

   If a PIM DR receives a neighbor Hello with LBM TLV, and the neighbor
   has the same DR priority as PIM DR itself, the PIM DR SHOULD consider
   the neighbor as a GDR candidate and insert the neighbor's address
   into the sorted list of LBGRD TLV.

6.2.  PIM GDR Candidate Operation

   When an IGMP join is received, without this proposal, router R1 (the
   PIM DR) will handle the join and potentially run into the issues
   described earlier.  Using this proposal, a simple algorithm is used
   to determine which router is going to be responsible for building
   forwarding trees on behalf of the host.

   The algorithm works as follows, assuming the router in question is X
   and a GDR Candidate:

   o  If the group is ASM, and if the RP Hash Mask announced by the PIM
      DR is not 0.0.0.0, calculate the value of hashvalue_RP.  If
      hashvalue_RP is the same as the ordinal number assigned implicitly
      to X by PIM DR, X becomes the GDR.
   o  If the group is ASM and if the RP Hash Mask announced by the PIM
      DR is 0, obtain the value of hashvalue_Group.  Then compare that
      to the ordinal value of X assigned by the PIM DR to decide if X is
      the GDR
   o  If the group is SSM, then use hashvalue_SG to determine if X is
      the GDR.

   If X is the GDR for the group, X will be responsible for building the
   forwarding tree.

   A router that supports this specification advertises LBM TLV in its
   Hello, even if the router may not be a GDR candidate.

   A GDR candidate may receive a LBM TLV from PIM DR router, with

   different Hash Masks from those advertised in its own Hello LBM TLV.
   The GDR candidate must use the Hash Masks advertised by the PIM DR
   Hello to calculate the hash value.

   A GDR candidate may receive an LBGDR TLV from a non-DR PIM router.
   The GDR candidate must ignore such LBGDR TLV.

   A GDR candidate may receive a Hello from the elected PIM DR, and the
   PIM DR does not support this specification.  The GDR election
   described by this specification will not take place, that is only the
   PIM DR joins the multicast tree.

6.3.  PIM Assert Modification

   When routers restart, GDR may change for a specific group, which
   might cause packet drops.

   For example, assume that there are two streams G1 and G2, and R1 is
   the GDR for G1 and R2 is the GDR for G2.  When R3 comes up online, it
   is possible that R2 becomes GDR for G1 and R3 becomes GDR for G2, and
   rebuilding of the forwarding trees for G1 and G2 will lead to
   potential packet loss.

   This is not a typical deployment scenario but it still might happen.
   Here we describe a mechanism to minimize the impact.

   When the role of GDR changes as above, instead of immediately
   stopping forwarding, R1 and R2 continue forwarding to G1 and G2
   respectively, while in the same time, R2 and R3 build forwarding
   trees for G1 and G2 respectively.  This will lead to PIM Asserts.

   The same tie breakers are used to select an Assert winner with one
   modification.  That is, instead of comparing IP addresses as the last
   resort, a router considers whether the sender of an Assert is a GDR.
   In this example, R1 will let R2 be the assert winner for G1, and R2
   will do the same for R3 for G2.  This will cause some duplicates in
   the network while minimizing packet loss.

   If a router on the LAN does not support this specification, the
   Assert modification described above will not take place, that is only
   the IP address of an Assert sender is used as the tie breaker.  For
   example, if R4, with preferred IP address, does not understand GDR
   and sends Assert for G1 to R2, which is the GDR for G1, R2 will grant
   R4 as the Assert winner, and clear OIF on R2.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Two new PIM Hello Option Types are required to be bassigned to the DR
   Load Balancing messages.  According to [HELLO-OPT], this document
   recommends 33(0x21) as the new "PIM DR Load Balancing GDR Hello
   Option", and 34(0x22) as the new "PIM DR Load Balancing Hash Masks
   Hello Option" .


8.  Security Considerations

   Security of the PIM DR Load Balancing Hello message is only
   guaranteed by the security of PIM Hello packet, so the security
   considerations for PIM Hello packets as described in PIM-SM [RFC4601]
   apply here.
