       IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option
               draft-elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-03


Abstract

   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on real
   (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end
   problem resolution. Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the
   fact, but must not impact an operational production network. The base
   metrics are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp.  Metrics
   derived from these will be described separately. This document solves
   these problems with a new destination option, the Performance and
   Diagnostic Metrics destination option (PDM).

1  Introduction

   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on real
   (non-synthetic) transmissions are critical for timely end-to-end
   problem resolution. Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the
   fact, but must not impact an operational production network. The base
   metrics are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp.  

   For background, please see draft-ackermann-tictoc-pdm-ntp-usage-00
   [ACKPDM], draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-packet-sequence-needed-01 [ELKPSN],
   draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-pdm-recommended-usage-01 [ELKUSE], draft-
   elkins-v6ops-ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01 [ELKRSP] and draft-elkins-
   ippm-pdm-metrics-01 [ELKIPPM]. These drafts are companions to this
   document.   

   As discussed in the above Internet Drafts, current methods are
   inadequate for these purposes because they assume unreasonable access
   to intermediate devices, are cost prohibitive, require infeasible
   changes to a running production network, and/or do not provide timely
   data.   This document provides a solution for these problems.

   As defined in RFC2460 [RFC2460], destination options are carried by
   the IPv6 Destination Options extension header.  Destination options
   include optional information that need be examined only by the IPv6
   node given as the destination address in the IPv6 header, not by
   routers or other "middle boxes".  This document specifies a new
   destination option, the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   destination option (PDM).

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Options

2.1  Destination Options Header

   The IPv6 Destination Options Header is used to carry optional
   information that need be examined only by a packet's destination
   node(s). The Destination Options Header is identified by a Next
   Header value of 60 in the immediately preceding header and is defined
   in RFC2460 [RFC2460].

2.2 PDM Types

INTERNET DRAFT    elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-03       October 2013


   The IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option (PDM)
   is an implementation of the Destination Options Header (Next Header
   value = 60).  Two types of PDM are defined. PDM type 1 requires time
   synchronization.  PDM type 2 does not require time synchronization.

   PDM type 1 and PDM type 2 are mutually exclusive.  That is, a 5-tuple
   can either both send PDM type 1 or both send PDM type 2.

2.3  Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option (Type 1)

   PDM type 1 is used to facilitate diagnostics by including a packet
   sequence number and timestamp. 

   The PDM type 1 is encoded in type-length-value (TLV) format as
   follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3

   8-bit unsigned integer. Length of the option, in octets, excluding
   the Option Type and Option Length fields. This field MUST be set to
   22.


   Packet Sequence Number This Packet (PSNTP)

   16-bit unsigned integer.  This field will wrap. It is intended for
   human use.

   Initialized at a random number and monotonically incremented for
   packet on the 5-tuple.  The 5-tuple consists of the source and
   destination IP addresses, the source and destination ports, and the
   upper layer protocol (ex. TCP, ICMP, etc).

   Operating systems MUST implement a separate packet sequence number
   counter per 5-tuple. Operating systems MUST NOT implement a single
   counter for all connections.  

   Note: This is consistent with the current implementation of the IPID
   field in IPv4 for many, but not all, stacks.


   TimeStamp This Packet (TSTP)

   A 64-bit unsigned integer field containing a timestamp that this
   packet was sent by the source node.  The value indicates the number
   of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 UTC, by using a fixed point
   format.  In this format, the integer number of seconds is contained
   in the first 32 bits of the field, and the remaining 32 bits resolve
   to picoseconds.

   This follows timestamp formats used in Network Time Protocol (NTP)
   [RFC5905] and SEND [RFC3971]. A discussion of why NTP is used in
   preference to Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is in draft-elkins-v6ops-
   ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01 [ELKRSP]. A discussion of how to
   implement NTP for use with the PDM header is in draft-ackermann-
   tictoc-pdm-ntp-usage-00 [ACKPDM].

   Implementation note: This format is compatible with the usual
   representation of time under UNIX, although the number of bits
   available for the integer and fraction parts in different Unix
   implementations vary.


   Packet Sequence Number Last Received (PSNLR)

   16-bit unsigned integer.  This is the PSN of the packet last received

   on the 5-tuple.


   TimeStamp Last Received (TSLR)

   A 64-bit unsigned integer field containing a timestamp.  This is the
   timestamp of the packet last received on the 5-tuple.  Format is the
   same as TSTP.


2.4  Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option (Type 2)

   The second type of IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   Destination Option (PDM) is as follows.  PDM type 1 and PDM type 2
   are mutually exclusive.  That is, a 5-tuple can either both send PDM
   type 1 or both send PDM type 2.

   PDM type 2 contains the following fields:

   PSNTP    : Packet Sequence Number This Packet     
   PSNLR    : Packet Sequence Number Last Received  
   DELTALR  : Delta Last Received                   
   PSNLS    : Packet Sequence Number Last Sent       
   DELTALS  : Delta Last Sent


   PDM destination option type 2 is encoded in type-length-value (TLV)
   format as follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   Delta Last Sent = Receive time packet 2 - Send time packet 1

   The value is in nanoseconds.


   Option Type

   The two highest-order bits of the Option Type field are encoded to
   indicate specific processing of the option; for the PDM destination
   option, these two bits MUST be set to 00. This indicates the
   following processing requirements:

     00 - skip over this option and continue processing the header.

   RFC2460 [RFC2460] defines other values for the Option Type field. 
   These MUST NOT be used in the PDM.  The other values are as follows:

         01 - discard the packet.

         10 - discard the packet and, regardless of whether or not the
   packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send an ICMP
   Parameter Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address,
   pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.

         11 - discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination
   Address was not a multicast address, send an ICMP Parameter Problem,
   Code 2, message to the packet's Source Address, pointing to the
   unrecognized Option Type.


   In keeping with RFC2460 [RFC2460], the third-highest-order bit of the
   Option Type specifies whether or not the Option Data of that option
   can change en-route to the packet's final destination. 

   In the PDM, the value of the third-highest-order bit MUST be 0.  The
   possible values are as follows:

         0 - Option Data does not change en-route

         1 - Option Data may change en-route

   The three high-order bits described above are to be treated as part
   of the Option Type, not independent of the Option Type.  That is, a
   particular option is identified by a full 8-bit Option Type, not just
   the low-order 5 bits of an Option Type.

2.5 Header Placement

INTERNET DRAFT    elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-03       October 2013


   The PDM destination option MUST be placed as follows:

      - Before the upper-layer header.  That is, this is the last
   extension header.

   This follows the order defined in RFC2460 [RFC2460] 

              IPv6 header

              Hop-by-Hop Options header

              Destination Options header 

              Routing header

              Fragment header

              Authentication header 

              Encapsulating Security Payload header 

              Destination Options header 

              upper-layer header	

   For each IPv6 packet header, the PDM MUST NOT appear more than once.
   However, an encapsulated packet MAY contain a separate PDM associated
   with each encapsulated IPv6 header.

   The inclusion of a PDM in a packet affects the receiving node's
   processing of only this single packet. No state is created or
   modified in the receiving node as a result of receiving a PDM in a
   packet.

2.6  Implementation Considerations

   The PDM destination options extension header SHOULD be turned on by
   each stack on a host node.

2.6.1 Dynamic Configuration Options

   If implemented, each operating system MUST have a default
   configuration parameter, e.g. diag_header_sys_default_value=yes/no. 
   The operating system MAY also have a dynamic configuration option to
   change the configuration setting as needed. 

   If the PDM destination options extension header is used, then it MAY
   be turned on for all packets flowing through the host, applied to an

   upper-layer protocol (TCP, UDP, SCTP, etc), a local port, or IP
   address only.  These are at the discretion of the implementation.

   The PDM MUST NOT be changed dynamically via packet flow as this may
   create potential security violation or DoS attack by numerous packets
   turning the header on and off.  

   As with all other destination options extension headers, the PDM is
   for destination nodes only. As specified above, intermediate devices
   MUST neither set nor modify this field. 

2.6.2 Data Length Filtering

   Different results for derived metrics, such as, server delay, will be
   obtained if calculations are done including or excluding packets
   which have a data length of 0 or 1.  Some protocols, for example,
   TCP, provide acknowledgements which have a length of 0.  Keep-alive
   packets have a data length of 0 or 1. 

   Operating systems may provide the user a choice of whether to include
   or exclude packets with a 0 or 1 byte data length.

2.6.3 5-tuple Aging

   Within the operating system, metrics must be kept on a 5-tuple basis.
    As discussed before, these are:

      PSNTP : Packet Sequence Number This Packet
      TSTP  : Timestamp This Packet 
      PSNLR : Packet Sequence Number Last Received
      TSLR  : Timestamp Last Received
      PROTC : Protocol for Upper Layer (ex. TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc)

   The question comes of when to stop keeping data or restarting the
   numbering for a 5-tuple.  For example, in the case of TCP, at some
   point, the connection will terminate.  Keeping data in control blocks
   forever, will have unfortunate consequences for the operating system.

   So, the recommendation is to use a known aging parameter such as Max
   Segment Lifetime (MSL) as defined in Transmission Control Protocol
   [RFC0793].  The choice of aging parameter is left up to the
   implementation.

3 Sample Implementation Flow (PDM 1) 

   Following is a sample simple flow for PDM type 1 with one packet sent
   from Host A and one packet received by Host B.  The calculations to
   derive meaningful metrics for network diagnostics from these fields

   is described in draft-elkins-ippm-pdm-metrics-00 [ELKIPPM].

   Time synchronization is required between Host A and Host B.

   Each packet, in addition to the PDM contains information on the
   sender and receiver. This is the 5-tuple consisting of:

           SADDR : IP address of the sender     
           SPORT : Port for sender    
           DADDR : IP address of the destination
           DPORT : Port for destination
           PROTC : Protocol for upper layer (ex. TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) 

   It should be understood that the packet identification information is
   in each packet. We will not repeat that in each of the following
   steps.

3.1 Step 1 (PDM 1)

   Packet 1 is sent from Host A to Host B.  The time for Host A is set
   initially to 10:00AM.

   The timestamp and packet sequence number are sent in the PDM.

   The initial PSNTP from Host A starts at a random number.  In this
   case, 25.  The sub-second portion of the timestamp has been omitted
   for the sake of simplicity.

   Host A and one packet received by Host B.  PDM 2 does not require
   time synchronization between Host A and Host B.  The calculations to
   derive meaningful metrics for network diagnostics is shown below each
   packet sent or received.

   Each packet, in addition to the PDM contains information on the
   sender and receiver. As discussed before, a 5-tuple consists of:

        SADDR : IP address of the sender     
        SPORT : Port for sender    
        DADDR : IP address of the destination
        DPORT : Port for destination
        PROTC : Protocol for upper layer (ex. TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc) 

   It should be understood that the packet identification information is
   in each packet. We will not repeat that in each of the following
   steps. 
4.1 Step 1 (PDM 2)

   Packet 1 is sent from Host A to Host B.  The time for Host A is set
   initially to 10:00AM.

   The timestamp and packet sequence number are noted by the sender
   internally.  The packet sequence number and timestamp are sent in the
   packet.

              Packet 1

                 |    A     |             |    B     |
                 |          |             |          |
                 +----------+             +----------+

                 PDM 2 Contents:

   PSNTP    : Packet Sequence Number This Packet:     25
   PSNLR    : Packet Sequence Number Last Received:   -
   DELTALR  : Delta Last Received:                    -
   PSNLS    : Packet Sequence Number Last Sent:       -
   DELTALS  : Delta Last Sent:                        -

   Internally, within the sender, Host A, it must keep:

   PSNTP : Packet Sequence Number This Packet:     25
   TSTP  : Timestamp This Packet:                  10:00:00

INTERNET DRAFT    elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-03       October 2013


   Note, the initial PSNTP from Host A starts at a random number.  In
   this case, 25.  The sub-second portion of the timestamp has been
   omitted for the sake of simplicity.

4.2 Step 2 (PDM 2)

   Packet 1 is received at Host B.  His time is set to one hour later
   than Host A.  In this case, 11:00AM

   Internally, within the receiver, Host B, it must keep:

   PSNLR : Packet Sequence Number Last Received:     25
   TSLR  : Timestamp Last Received             :     11:00:03 

   Note, this timestamp is in Host B time.  It has nothing whatsoever to
   do with Host A time.  


4.3 Step 3 (PDM 2)

   Packet 2 is sent by Host B to Host A.  Note, the initial PSNTP from
   Host B starts at a random number.  In this case, 12.   Before sending
   the packet, Host B does a calculation of deltas.  Since Host B knows
   when it is sending the packet, and it knows when it received the
   previous packet, it can do the following calculation:

   Sending time (packet 2) - receive time (packet 1)

   The result of this calculation: Delta Last Received. 

   That is:

   DELTALR = Sending time (packet 2) - receive time (packet 1)

   Note, both sending time and receive time are saved internally in Host
   B.  They do not travel in the packet.  Only the Delta is in the
   packet.

   Assume that within Host B is the following:


   PSNLR : Packet Sequence Number Last Received:     25
   TSLR  : Timestamp Last Received             :     11:00:03 
   PSNTP : Packet Sequence Number This Packet  :     12      
   TSTP  : Timestamp This Packet               :     11:00:07   

   Hence, DELTALR becomes:

   4 seconds = 11:00:07 - 11:00:03


4.4 Step 4 (PDM 2)

   Packet 2 is received at Host A.  Remember, its time is set to one
   hour earlier than Host B. It will keep internally:

   PSNLR : Packet Sequence Number Last Received:     12
   TSLR  : Timestamp Last Received             :     10:00:12 

   Note, this timestamp is in Host A time.  It has nothing whatsoever to
   do with Host B time. 

   The formula for end-to-time is:

   Time Last Received - Time Last Sent 

   For example, packet 25 was sent by Host A at 10:00:00.  Packet 12 was
   received by Host A at 10:00:12 so:

   End-to-End response time = 10:00:12 - 10:00:00 or 12 seconds

   This derived metric we will call DELTALS or Delta Last Sent.

   At this point all metrics are in the Host and not exposed in a
   packet. To do that, we need a third packet.

4.5 Step 5 (PDM 2)

   Packet 3 is sent from Host A to Host B.

5  Backward Compatibility

   The scheme proposed in this document is backward compatible with all
   the currently defined IPv6 extension headers. According to RFC2460
   [RFC2460], if the destination node does not recognize this option, it
   should skip over this option and continue processing the header.

6  Security Considerations

   The PDM MUST NOT be changed dynamically via packet flow as this
   creates a possibility for potential security violations or DoS
   attacks by numerous packets turning the header on and off.  


7  IANA Considerations

   An option type must be assigned by IANA for the Performance and
   Diagnostic Metrics destination option.
