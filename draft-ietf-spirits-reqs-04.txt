This document describes the SPIRITS protocol requirements,
based on the architecture presented in RFC 3136.  (SPIRITS
stands for "Service in the PSTN/IN Requesting InTernet
Service".)  The purpose of the protocol is to support services
that originate in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
and necessitate the interactions between the PSTN and the
Internet.  Similarly, such services are called SPIRITS services.
(Internet Call Waiting, Internet Caller-ID Delivery, and Internet
Call Forwarding are examples of SPIRIT services, but the protocol
is to define the building blocks from which many other services
can be built.)  On the PSTN side, the SPIRITS services are
initiated from the Intelligent Network (IN) entities; the earlier
IETF work on the PSTN/Internet Interworking (PINT) resulted in
the protocol (RFC 2848) in support of the services initiated
the other way around--from the Internet to PSTN.

To this end, this document lists general requirements for the
SPIRITS protocol as well as those pertinent to IN, Wireless
IN, and PINT building blocks.  The document also presents the
SPIRITS WG consensus on the choice of the SPIRITS signaling protocol.

This document is a product of the Service in the PSTN/IN Requesting
InTernet Service Working Group of the IETF.
