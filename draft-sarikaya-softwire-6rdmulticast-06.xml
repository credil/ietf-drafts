<abstract>   
   <t>This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6 hosts
   can receive multicast data from IPv6 servers.  In the 6rd
   encapsulation solution, multicast communication is completely
   integrated into the 6rd tunnel. In the 6rd translation solution, the
   protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge router
   interworking the MLD messages to IGMP messages and sending them
   upstream through a network which supports IPv4 multicast. The 6rd
   Border Relay is a multicast router and interworks the IGMP to MLD for
   onward propasgation toward the IPv6 multicast source.  IPv6 Multicast
   data received at 6rd Border Relay is translated into IPv4 multicast
   data and and delivered through the IPv4 multicast tree downstream to
   the 6rd Customer Edge. The latter translates it back to IPv6 multicast
   data then delivers it to the hosts.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
  
  <t>With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are
  being standardized for IPv6 migration including 6rd <xref
  target="RFC5969"/>. 6rd enables IPv6 hosts to communicate with
  external hosts using an IPv4-only legacy ISP network. The 6rd Customer
  Edge (CE) device's LAN side is dual stack and the WAN side is IPv4
  only.  The CE tunnels IPv6 packets received from the LAN side to 6rd
  Border Relays (BR) after encapsulating them as IPv4 packets.  The BRs
  have anycast IPv4 addresses and receive encapsulated packets from CEs
  over a virtual interface. 6rd operation is stateless.  Packets are
  received/ sent independently of each other and no state needs to be
  maintained.</t>
  
  <t>It should be noted that there is no depletion problem for IPv4
  address space allocated for any source multicast and source specific
  multicast <xref target="RFC3171"/>.  This document is not motivated by
  the depletion of IPv4 multicast addresses.</t>
  
  <t>6rd as defined in <xref target="RFC5969"/> and <xref
  target="RFC5569"/> is unicast only.  It does not support multicast.
  In this document we specify how multicast from home IPv6 users can be
  supported in 6rd.  This is what is meant by 6rd multicast
  protocol.</t>
  
  <t>In the 6rd encapsulation approach, 6rd multicast is integrated into
  the 6rd unicast solution. 6rd customer premise equipment (CPE) is
  extended to support an MLD proxy <xref target="RFC4605"/>. This proxy
  receives MLD Membership Report messages <xref target="RFC4601"/>
  requesting to join a multicast group from its subtended hosts. It
  tunnels aggregated join requests upstream to the 6rd Border Router
  (BR) using IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation. The 6rd Border Router is
  extended to support an MLD querier, which sends join requests upstream
  towards the multicast source(s, becomes part of the multicast tree,
  and thus receives IPv6 multicast data. The 6rd Border Router
  encapsulates the IPv6 multicast data using 6rd's IPv6 in IPv4
  encapsulation and sends it to each member CPE that has joined the
  stream concerned. The CPE decapsulates the packet and the MLD proxy
  sends the IPv6 multicast data downstream to the member hosts.</t>
  
  <t>In the translation approach, native IPv4 multicast support in the
  network between Customer Edge routers and Border Router can be
  exploited.  The translation approach requires MLD to IGMP interworking
  at the Customer Edge and IGMP to MLD interworking at the border
  router. The border router needs to translate IPv6 multicast data into
  IPv4 multicast data and the Customer Edge router needs to translate
  IPv4 multicast data back into IPv6 multicast data.</t>
  
  <t>6rd's CE to CE forwarding feature is not used in either
  approach.</t>

  <t>This section states requirements on 6rd multicast support

  <t>6rd multicast MUST NOT introduce the need to use more IPv4

</section>  <!-- req -->


<section anchor="arch" title="Architecture">
  
  <t>In 6rd, IPv6 or IPv4/IPv6 dual stack hosts are served by the 6rd
  Customer Edge device (CE).  The CE is dual stack facing the hosts and
  IPv4 only facing the network or WAN side.  The CE tunnels IPv6 packets
  in IPv4 to the 6rd Border Relay (BR).  The BR decapsulates the
  tunneled packets and forwards them to the IPv6 network. In the reverse
  direction, the BR receives IPv6 packets from the IPv6 network tunnels
  them in IPv4 to the CE. The CE decapsulates the IPv6 packets and
  forwards them to the hosts.</t>
  
  <t>Unicast 6rd is stateless.  Each IPv6 packet sent by the CE is
  treated separately and different packets from the same CE may go to
  different BRs.  The CE encapsulates IPv6 packets in IPv4 with the IPv4
  destination address set to the BR address (usually an anycast IPv4
  address).  BRs are placed where IPv6 native connectivity exists to
  other networks.  A CE is configured with its own IPv4 address (public
  or private), with a 6rd IPv6 prefix from which the CE's IPv4 address
  can be derived, and with one or more BR IPv4 addresses.  When the BR
  receives IPv6 packets addressed to the CE, it extracts the CE's IPv4
  address from the destination IPv6 address and uses this address as the
  destination address for the IPv4 encapsulation of the IPv6 packet.
  6rd views the IPv4-only network as an NBMA link from the IPv6 point of
  view and all 6rd CEs and BRs are defined as off-link neighbors from
  one other.</t>
  
  <section anchor="encaps" title="6rd Tunneling Architecture">

    <t>In order to support multicast, the CE implements an MLD Proxy
    function <xref target="RFC4605"/>.  IPv6 hosts send their join
    requests (MLD Membership Report messages) to CE.  The CE as a proxy sends
    aggregated Report messages upstream towards BR in unicast using IPv6
    in IPv4 encapsulation.</t>

<section anchor="tunop" title="6rd Tunneling Multicast Operation">

  <t>In this section we specify how the host can subscribe and receive
  IPv6 multicast data from IPv6 content providers based on the
  architecture defined in <xref target="fig_tun"/>.</t>
  
  <t>The hosts will send their subscription requests for IPv6 multicast
  groups upstream to the default router, i.e., Costumer Edge device.
  After subscribing the group, the host can receive multicast data from
  the CE.  The host implements MLD protocol's host part.</t>
  
  <t>The Customer Edge device is an MLD Proxy.  After receiving the
  first MLD Report message requesting subscription to an IPv6 multicast
  group, the CE establishes a tunnel interface with a Border Relay.  The
  tunnel is IPv4 based but it will carry MLD messages back and forth and
  IPv6 multicast data messages downstream.</t>
  
  <t>The CE is a regular MLD proxy and it keeps an MLD proxy membership
  database. The CE inserts multicast forwarding state on the incoming
  interface, and merges state updates into the MLD proxy membership
  database.  The CE updates or remove elements from the database as
  required.  The CE will then send an aggregated Report via the upstream
  tunnel to the BR when the membership database changes.</t>
  
  <t>The CE answers MLD queries from the BR based on the membership
  database. The CE's downstream link follows the traditional multipoint
  channel forwarding and does not pose any specific problems.</t>
  
  <t>The CE receives IPv6 multicast data from the BR tunneled over the
  tunnel interface.  The CE decapsulates the packet and then forwards it
  downstream.  Each member host receives the data packet based on the
  Layer 2 multicast interface.  No packet duplication is necessary.</t>
  
  <t>The Border Relay acts as the default multicast querier for all CEs
  that have established an IPv4 tunnel with it.  In order to keep a
  consistent multicast state between a CE and BR, once a CE is connected
  it will stay connected until the state becomes empty. After that
  point, the CE may establish another tunnel to a different BR.</t>
  
  <t>According to aggregated MLD reports received from subtending CEs,
  the BR establishes group/source-specific multicast forwarding states
  at its corresponding downstream tunnel interfaces.  After that, the BR
  maintains or removes the state as required by the aggregated reports
  received from CEs.</t>
  
  <t>At the upstream interface, the BR procures for aggregated multicast
  membership maintenance.  Based on the multicast-transparent operations
  of the CEs, the BR treats its tunnel interfaces as multicast enabled
  downstream links, serving zero to many listening nodes.</t>
  
  <t>When the BR receives MLD join requests from downstream CEs, the BR
  sends PIM join messages upstream towards multicast source(s).  This
  results in a multicast tree formation where the BR is at the leaf of
  the multicast tree, enabling the BR to receive IPv6 multicast data
  sent by the source.</t>
  
  <t>Multicast traffic arriving at the BR is transparently forwarded
  according to its multicast forwarding information base.  Multicast
  data is first replicated according to MLD multicast group state and
  then forwarded in IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels from the BR to the
  corresponding CEs.</t>
  
  <section anchor="tunif" title="Tunnel Interface Considerations">

    <t>IPv6 in IPv4 tunneling is performed as specified in
    <xref target="RFC4213"/>. Considerations specified in
    <xref target="RFC5969"/> apply.  Packets passing upstream from the CE
    carry only MLD signaling messages and they are not expected to be
    fragmented. However packets downstream, i.e., multicast data to the
    CEs, may be subject to fragmentation.</t>
    
    <t>Source and destination addresses of MLD messages in IPv6-in-IPv4
    tunnel from CE are as follows:
    <list style="symbols">
      
      <t>The source address of IPv4 header is the CE WAN interface IPv4
      address. The destination address is the BR anycast address when an
      invite message is sent to group G. Subsequent messages to group G
      contain the BR unicast address as destination address.</t>
      
      <t>The source address of the inner MLD message is the link local
      address. The destination address is all MLDv2-capable multicast
      routers or FF02::16 for MLD Version 2 Multicast Listener Reports.</t>
    </list>
    </t>
    
    <t>The source and destination addresses of MLD messages in the IPv6-
    in-IPv4 softwire from BR are as follows:
    <list style="symbols">
      
      <t>The source address of the IPv4 header is the BR IPv4 unicast
      address. The destination address is the CE IPv4 address. This also
      holds for multicast data.</t>
      
      <t>The source address of the inner MLD message is the link local
      address. The destination address is the link-scope all-nodes multicast
      address (FF02::1) for General Queries, or the IPv6 multicast group
      address for specific queries.</t>
    </list>
    </t>
    
    <t>The source address of IPv6 multicast data is the unicast IPv6
    address of the multicast source, e.g., the content provider. The
    destination address is the3 IPv6 multicast group address.</t>

  </section>  <!-- tunif -->
  
  <section anchor="avalanch" title="Avalanche Problem">

    <t>In <xref target="tunif"/>, multicast data is replicated to all
    interfaces, i.e., to all member CEs at the BR.  This replication
    (often called avalanche problem) can be very costly if is a very large
    number of downstream member CEs such as in the IPTV application. See
    Appendix A in <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast"/>.</t>
    
    <t>In 6rd tunneling multicast, the avalanche problem can be reduced by
    careful network partitioning.  More BRs can be deployed in areas where
    IPv6 users are increasing in numbers.  Deploying BRs by collocating
    them with the access network gateway as with the Border Network
    Gateway (BNG) is another possibility.</t>
    
    <t>In the 6rd tunneling multicast operation, CEs are enabled to
    exploit multiple BRs that can be deployed in the network by using the
    BR anycast address any time they send an upstream MLD join request and
    then using the same BR that received the join message in subsequent
    MLD messages by using the same BR's unicast address.</t>

  <t>The hosts will send their subscription requests for IPv6 multicast
  groups upstream to the default router, i.e., the Costumer Edge device.
  After subscribing the group, the host can receive multicast data from
  the CE.  The host implements the MLD protocol's host part.</t>
  
  <t>The Customer Edge device is an MLD Proxy.  After receiving the
  first MLD Report message requesting subscription to an IPv6 multicast
  group, the CE interworks the MLD Membership Report message to an IGMP
  Membership report message. It sends it upstream only if joining a new
  group is needed.</t>
  
  <t>Address translation in generating an IGMP Membership report message
  is done as follows: the destination address is copied from the last 32
  bits of IPv6 multicast group address. The CE inserts the IPv4 address
  of its WAN interface into the source address.  It is assumed that the
  IPv6 multicast group address in MLD Report message conforms to the
  addressing scheme described in 
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format"/>, for
  any-source and source-specific multicast address formats.</t>
  
  <t>Source addresses in the MLDv2 payload are translated as follows.
  Multicast source addresses in MLD Membership Report message MUST use
  uPrefix64, i.e. 64:ff9b::/96 defined in <xref target="RFC6052"/>.
  uPrefix64 facilitates translation into an IPv4 source address to be
  used in IGMPv3 Membership Report messages for source-specific
  multicast, i.e., by extracting the last 32 bits of IPv6 source
  address.</t>
  
  <t>The IGMP Report message is received by the IGMP Querier/Proxy
  upstream on the link. (Normally this node is the Broadband Network
  Gateway, BNG in broadband networks.)  The IGMP Querier/Proxy sends
  IGMPv3 Report message to the neighboring routers to join the group.
  In networks where PIM is supported, the IGMP Report message may be
  received by the PIM Designated Router. The PIM router sends a PIMv4
  join message to join an IPv4 group.</t>
  
  <t>The border router that receives the join message translates the
  message into MLD.  To join an IPv6 group for any-source multicast, the
  IPv6 Multicast group address is obtained from the destination address.
  For source-specific multicast, the IPv6 source address is generated
  after obtaining the IPv4 source address of Membership Report message's
  Group Record Source Address field.  The BR sends the PIMv6 join
  message upstream towards the source.</t>
  
  <t>The BR MUST act as the designated router to which the source of the
  source-specific IGMP join message is connected.  The BR MUST act as
  the rendez-vous point (RP) of the multicast group for the any-source
  multicast IGMP join message.  Normally there is one such BR in an
  operator's network.  An IPv4 multicast tree eventually forms in the
  network between the CE and BR and an IPv6 multicast tree upstream from
  the BR for the same ASM or SSM group.</t>
  
  <t>IPv6 multicast data received at the border router from the source
  is translated into IPv4.  The last 32 bits of the source and
  destination address fields determine the source and destination
  addresses of the IPv4 multicast data packet.  This packet is sent
  downstream on the multicast tree already formed for this IPv4
  multicast group.</t>
  
  <t>Multicast data packet address translation follows the rules in
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format"/> for the
  multicast group address and <xref target="RFC6052"/> for source-
  specific multicast source address, i.e. using uPrefix64.  For any-
  source multicast, the Border Router inserts an IPv4 source address,
  different for each source.</t>
  
  <t>Packet header translation follows the rules in <xref
  target="RFC6145"/>. Fragmentation and reassembly are handled as
  described in <xref target="RFC6145"/>. After the IPv4 multicast data
  packet is sent downstream from the BR it may be fragmented by the
  routers.</t>
  
  <t>The CE receives the IPv4 multicast data packet, possibly in
  fragments, and reassembles the fragments.  The CE translates the IPv4
  multicast data packet back to an IPv6 multicast data packet.  Address
  translation is done following 
  <xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format"/> for
  multicast group addresses and <xref target="RFC6052"/> for unicast SSM
  source addresses. Header translation is done as in
  <xref target="RFC6145"/>.</t>
  
  <t>IPv6 multicast data is sent on the home link to the host(s).  IEEE
  802.3 or IEEE 802.11 multicast link support usually handles this
  delivery in Layer 2 without any packet duplication if there are more
  than one members to the any-source multicast group or SSM source and
  multicast group.</t>
  
  <section anchor="l2transup" title="Solution Based on Layer 2 Multicast Support">

    <t>In this section we assume that Layer 2 multicast is supported in
    the network.  Layer 2 multicast support is done in order to forward
    multicast data downstream to the ports of Layer 2 devices, i.e.
    switches that requested a multicast group instead of flooding the data
    to all the ports.</t>
    
    <t>In the switches, called snooping switches, multicast MAC address
    based filters are set up which link layer 2 multicast groups to the
    egress ports.  IGMP snooping switches are commonly used in operators'
    networks, most commonly at the access nodes (AN)
    <xref target="RFC6788"/>.</t>
    
   <t> When an IGMP Report message is received, the bridge will set up a
   multicast filter entry that allows (in case of a join message) or
   prevents (in case of a leave message) packets to flow on the port on
   which the IGMP Report message was received.  In terms of IPv4
   multicast addresses, the mapping is not unique as 32 IPv4 multicast
   addresses map to a single Ethernet multicast MAC address
   <xref target="RFC4541"/>.</t>
    
    <t>The main functionality of a snooping switch is to forward multicast
    data packets based on the filters that are setup, i.e. to those egress
    ports with multicast groups downstream and also to the router
    ports.</t>
    
    <t>In a 6rd network the snooping switches must detect IGMP packets
    sent upstream by the CE and set the filtering rules accordingly.  When
    IPv4 data packets are received the IGMP snooping switches forward
    these packets towards all CEs that have members, effectively achieving
    packet duplication at the access node level.</t>

  <section anchor="analys" title="Analysis">
  
    <t>An analysis of the translation solution reveals the following:\
    <list style="symbols">
      
      <t>The translation solution imposes a requirement on the IPv6 source-
      specific multicast sources to use uPrefix64 compatible source
      addresses.  This requirement cannot be satified with simple
      configuration of the CPE router and Border Router.</t>
      
      <t>In the case of any-source multicast, the border router must use a
      public IPv4 address distinctively to represent each IPv6 any-source
      multicast source.</t>
      
      <t>In deployments which use IGMP routers, not PIM routers,
      source-specific multicast can be supported only if all routers have
      been upgraded to IGMPv3 and no IGMPv1 or IGMPv2 systems are present.
      Otherwise the operation reverts to the older version of IGMP to
      preserve compatibility and thus SSM can not be supported.  With the
      use of PIM routers, this is avoided.</t>
      
      <t>The border router must act as the designated router or the rendez-
      vous point for the IPv4/IPv6 multicast group and this may lead to the
      use of a single border router in the network instead of load sharing
      with various border routers.</t>
