Abstract

   Edge RBridges currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses
   and their egress RBridges by observing the data packets traversed
   or by the TRILL ESADI protocol. When ingress RBridge receives a
   data frame whose destination address (MAC&VLAN) that RBridge does
   not know, the data frame is flooded within the VLAN across the
   TRILL campus.

   This draft describes the framework for using directory services
   to assist edge RBridges by reducing multi-destination frames,
   particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND,
   improving TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   network scalability in environments such as data centers.

1. Introduction

   Edge RBridges (devices implementing [RFC6325], also known as
   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) Switches)
   currently learn the mapping between destination MAC addresses and
   their egress RBridges by observing data packets or by ESADI (End
   Station Address Distribution Information). When an ingress
   RBridge receives a data frame for a destination address
   (MAC&VLAN) that RBridge does not know, the data frame is flooded
   within that VLAN across the TRILL campus.

   This draft describes the framework for using directory services
   to assist edge RBridges by reducing multi-destination frames,
   particularly ARP [RFC826], ND [RFC4861], and unknown unicast,
   improving TRILL network scalability in environments, such as data
   centers.

   Data center networks are different from enterprise campus
   networks in several ways, in particular:

   1. Data centers, especially Internet and/or multi-tenant data
     centers tend to have a large number of end stations with a wide
     variety of applications.
   2. Topology is usually based on racks and rows.
        - Guest OS assignment to Servers, Racks, and Rows is
          orchestrated by a Server/VM Management system, not done at
          random.
   3. Rapid workload shifting in data centers can accelerate the
     frequency of the physical servers being re-loaded with
     different applications. Sometimes, the applications loaded into
     one physical server at different times can belong to different
     subnets.
   4. With server virtualization, there is an increasing trend to
     dynamically create or delete VMs when demand for resource
     changes, to move VMs from overloaded servers to less loaded
     servers, or to aggregate VMs onto fewer servers when demand is
     light.

   Both 3) and 4) above can lead to applications in one subnet being
   placed in different locations (racks or rows) or one rack having
   applications belonging to different subnets.

2. Terminology

   The terms "Subnet" and "VLAN" are used interchangeably in this
   document because it is common to map one subnet to one VLAN.



   Bridge:  IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011 compliant device [802.1Q]. In this
             draft, Bridge is used interchangeably with Layer 2
             switch.

   DA:     Destination Address

   DC:      Data Center

   EoR:    End of Row switches in data center. Also known as
             aggregation switches.

   End Station:    Guest OS running on a physical server or on a
             virtual machine. An end station in this document has at
             least one IP address and at least one MAC address, which
             could be in DA or SA field of a data frame.

   RBridge: ''Routing Bridge'', an alternative name for a TRILL
             switch.

   SA:     Source Address

   Station: A node, or a virtual node, with IP and/or MAC addresses,
             which could be in the DA or SA of a data frame.

   ToR:    Top of Rack Switch in data center. It is also known as
             access switches in some data centers.

   TRILL:   Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links [RFC6325]

   TRILL switch: A device implementing the TRILL protocol [RFC6325]

3. TRILL Campus Impact of Massive Number of End Stations in a DC

   3.1. Issues of Flooding Based Learning in DCs

   It is common for Data Center networks to have multiple tiers of
   switches, for example, one or two Access Switches for each server
   rack (ToR), aggregation switches for some rows (or EoR switches),

   and some core switches to interconnect the aggregation switches.
   Many aggregation switches deployed in data centers have high port
   density. It is not uncommon to see aggregation switches
   interconnecting hundreds of ToR switches.

              Figure 1: Typical Data Center Network Design

   The following problems could occur when TRILL is deployed in a
   data center with large number of end stations and the end
   stations in one subnet/VLAN could be placed under multiple edge
   RBridges:

      - Unnecessary filling of slots in the MAC learning table of
        edge RBridges, e.g. RB1 (or T11), due to RB1 receiving
        broadcast/multicast traffic (e.g. ARP/ND, cluster multicast,
        etc.) from end stations under other edge RBridges that are
        not actually communicating with any end stations attached to
        RB1.

      - Some edge RBridge ports being blocked for user traffic when
        there are more than one RBridge ports connected to an edge
        bridged LAN. When there are multiple RBridge ports connected
        to a bridged LAN in each VLAN, only one (the Appointed
        Forwarder port) can forward/receive native traffic for that
        bridged LAN or VLAN. The rest have to be blocked for
        forwarding/receiving native traffic for that VLAN. When


Dunbar, et al                                           [Page 6]

        servers have dual uplinks to two different ToR switches (or
        edge RBridges), some links may not be fully utilized.

      - Packets being flooded across TRILL campus when their DAs are
        not in ingress RBridge's cache.

      - In an environment where VMs migrates, there is higher chance
        of cached entries becoming invalid, causing traffic to be
        black holed by the egress RBridge. If VMs send out
        gratuitous ARP/ND or [802.1Qbg] VDP messages upon arriving
        at new locations, the ingress nodes might not have the MAC
        entries for the newly arrived VMs, causing more unknown
        flooding.

   3.2. Some Examples

   Consider a data center with 1600 server racks. Each server rack
   has at least one ToR switch. The ToR switches are further divided
   into 8 groups, with each group being connected by a set of
   aggregation switches.  There could be 4 to 8 aggregation switches
   in each set to achieve load sharing for traffic to/from server
   racks. If TRILL is deployed in this data center environment,
   let's consider the following two scenarios for the TRILL campus
   boundary:

       - Scenario #1: TRILL campus boundary starts at ToR switches:

         If each server rack has one uplink to one ToR, there are
         1600 edge RBridges. If each rack has dual uplinks to two ToR
         switches, then there will be 3200 edge RBridges

         In this scenario, the TRILL domain will have more than 1600
         (or 3200) + 8*4 (or 8*8) nodes, which is a large IS-IS
         domain. Even though a mesh IS-IS domain can scale up to
         thousands of nodes, it is challenging for aggregation
         switches to handle IS-IS link state advertisement among
         hundreds of parallel ports.

       - Scenario #2: TRILL campus boundary starts at the aggregation
        switches:

         With the same assumption as before, the number of nodes in
         the TRILL campus will be less than 100, and aggregation
         switches don't have to handle IS-IS link state advisements
         among hundreds of parallel ports.



Dunbar, et al                                           [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    TRILL Directory Assistance Framework  Oct 2012



         But bridged LANs are formed under the aggregation switches
         in this scenario.  With aggregation switches being the
         RBridge edge nodes, multiple RBridge edge ports could be
         connected to one bridged LAN. To avoid potential loops,
         TRILL requires only one of multiple RBridge edge ports
         connected to each VLAN being designated as Appointed
         Forwarder [RFC6439], and other ports being blocked for
         native frames in that VLAN.

         In addition, the number of MAC&VLAN<->Egress RBridge Mapping
         entries to be learned and managed by RBridge edge node can
         be very large. In the example above, each edge RBridge has
         200 edge ports facing the ToR switches. If each ToR has 40
         downstream ports facing servers and each server has 10 VMs,
         there could be 200*40*10 = 80000 end stations attached. If
         all those end stations belong to 1600 VLANs (i.e. 50 per
         VLAN) and each VLAN has 200 end stations, then under the
         worst-case scenario, the total number of MAC&VLAN entries to
         be learned by the edge RBridge can be 1600*200=320000, which
         is very large.

4. Benefits of Directory Assisted Edge RBridge in DC

   In the data center environment, application placement to servers,
   racks, and rows is orchestrated by Server (or VM) Management
   System(s). That is, there is a database or multiple databases
   (distributed model) that have the knowledge of where each
   application is placed. If the application location information
   can be fed to RBridge edge nodes, in some form of Directory
   Service, then there is much less chance of RBridge edge nodes
   receiving unknown MAC-DA, therefore less chance of flooding.

   Avoiding unknown unicast MAC-DA flooding to the TRILL campus is
   especially valuable in the data center environment because there
   is a higher chance of an edge RBridge receiving packets with
   unknown unicast DA and broadcast/multicast messages due to VM
   migration and servers being loaded with different applications.
   When a VM is moved to a new location or a server is loaded with a
   new application with a different IP/MAC addresses, it is more
   likely that the DA of data packets sent out from those VMs are
   unknown to their attached edge RBridges.  In addition, gratuitous
   ARP (IPv4, [RFC826]) or Unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement (IPv6,
   [RFC4861]) sent out from those newly migrated or activated VMs
   have to be flooded to other edge RBridges that have VMs in the
   same subnets.

   The benefits of using directory assistance include:


Dunbar, et al                                           [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    TRILL Directory Assistance Framework  Oct 2012



      - Avoid flooding unknown unicast DA across TRILL campus. The
        Directory enforced MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge mapping table
        can determine if a data packet needs to be forwarded across
        TRILL campus.

         When multiple RBridge edge ports are connected via a bridged
         LAN to end stations (servers/VMs), a directory assisted edge
         RBridge won't need to flood unknown unicast DA data frames
         to all ports of the edge RBridges in the frame's VLAN when
         it ingresses a frame. It can depend on the directory to tell
         it where the DA is. When the directory doesn't have the
         needed information, the frames can be dropped or flooded
         depending on the policy configured.

      - Reduce flooding of decapsulated Ethernet frames with unknown
        MAC-DA to a bridged LAN connected to RBridge edge ports.

         When an RBridge receives a TRILL frame whose destination
         Nickname matches with its own, the normal procedure is for
         the RBridge to decapsulate the TRILL header and forward the
         decapsulated Ethernet frame to the directly attached bridged
         LAN. If the destination MAC is unknown, the normal
         Ethernet switch's flooding will occur with the decapsulated
         Ethernet frame. With directory assistance, the egress
         RBridge can determine if the MAC-DA in a frame matches with
         any end stations attached via the bridged LAN. Frames can be
         discarded if their DAs do not match.

      - Reduce the amount of MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge mapping
        maintained by edge RBridges. There is no need for an edge
        RBridge to keep MAC entries of remote end stations that
        don't communicate with the end stations locally attached.

      - Eliminate ARP/ND being broadcasted or multi-casted through
        the TRILL core.

5. Generic operation of Directory Assistance

   5.1. Information in Directory for Edge RBridges

   To achieve the benefits of directory assistance for TRILL, the
   corresponding directory server entries will need, at a minimum,
   the following logical attributes:



Dunbar, et al                                           [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    TRILL Directory Assistance Framework  Oct 2012



   [{IP, MAC/VLAN, {list of attached RBridge nicknames}, {list of
   interested RBridges}]

   The {list of attached RBridges} are the RBridges to which the
   host (or VM) specified by the [IP or MAC/VLAN] in the entry is
   attached. The {list of interested RBridges} are the remote
   RBridges that might have attached hosts to communicate with the
   host in this entry.

   When a host has multiple IP addresses, there will be multiple
   entries.

   The {list of interested RBridges} would get populated when an
   RBridge queries for information, or pushed down from management
   systems. The list is used to notify those RBridges when the host
   (specified by the IP/MAC/VLAN) in the entry connectivity to its
   attached RBridges changes. An explicit list in the directory is
   not needed as long as the interested RBridges can be determined.

   There are two different models for Directory assistance to
   RBridge edge nodes: Push Model and Pull Model.

   5.2. Push Model and Requirements

   Under this model, Directory Server(s) push down the MAC&VLAN <->
   Egress RBridge mapping for all the end stations that might
   communicate with end stations attached to an RBridge edge node.
   Under this model, if the packet's destination address can't be
   found in the MAC&VLAN<->Egress RBridge table, the ingress RBridge
   can be configured to:

       simply drop a data packet,
       flooding to TRILL campus, or
       Start the pull process to get information from directory
        server(s)

   It may not be necessary for every edge RBridge to get the entire
   mapping table for all the end stations in a data center. There
   are many ways to narrow the full set down to a smaller set of
   remote end stations that communicate with end stations attached
   to an edge RBridge. A simple approach is to only pushing down the
   mapping for the VLANs that have active end stations under an edge
   RBridge. This approach can reduce the number of mapping entries
   being pushed down.




Dunbar, et al                                           [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    TRILL Directory Assistance Framework  Oct 2012



   However, the Push Model usually will push down more entries of
   MAC&VLAN<->Egress RBridge mapping to edge RBridges than needed.
   Under the normal process of edge RBridge cache aging and unknown
   DA flooding, rarely used mapping entries would have been removed.
   But it can be difficult for Directory Servers to predict the
   communication patterns among applications within one VLAN.
   Therefore, it is likely that the Directory Servers will push down
   all the MAC&VLAN entries if there are end stations in the VLAN
   being attached to the edge RBridge. This is a disadvantage of the
   Push Model compared with the Pull Model described below.

   In the Push Model, it is necessary to have a way for an RBridge
   node to request directory server(s) to start pushing down the
   mapping entries. This method should at least include the VLANs
   enabled on the RBridge, so that directory server doesn't need to
   push down the entire mapping entries for all the end stations in
   the data center. An RBridge must be able to get mapping entries
   when it is initialized or restarted.

   The Push Model's detailed method and any hand-shake mechanism
   between RBridge and Directory Server(s) is beyond the scope of
   this framework draft.

   When directory server needs to push down a very large number of
   entries to edge RBridges, summarization should be considered. For
   example, with one edge RBridge Nickname being associated with all
   attached end stations' MAC addresses and VLANs as shown below:

          Table 1: Summarized table pushed down from directory

   Whenever there is any change in MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge
   mapping, that can be triggered by end stations being added,
   moved, or de-commissioned, an incremental update can be sent to
   the edge RBridges which are impacted by the change. Therefore,
   something like a sequence number has to be maintained by
   directory servers and RBridges. Detailed mechanisms will be
   specified in a separate document.

   5.3. Pull Model and Requirements

   Under this model, an RBridge pulls the MAC&VLAN<->Egress RBridge
   mapping entry from the directory server when its cache doesn't
   have the entry. There are several options to trigger the pulling
   process:

      - The RBridge edge node can send a pull request whenever it
        receives an unknown MAC-DA, or
      - The RBridge edge node can simply intercept all ARP/ND
        requests and forward them to the Directory Server(s) that
        has the information on where the target stations are located.
      - The Pull Directory response could indicate that the MAC-DA
        being queried is unknown or that the requestor is
        administratively prohibited from getting an informative
        response.

   By using a Pull Directory, the frame with unknown MAC-DA doesn't
   have to be flooded across TRILL domain and the ARP/ND requests
   don't have to be broadcast or multicast across TRILL domain.

   The ingress RBridge can cache the response pulled down from the
   directory. The timer for cache should be short in an environment
   where VMs move frequently. The cache timer could be configured by
   management system or could be sent down along with the Pulled
   reply by the directory server(s).

   One advantage of the Pull Model is that edge RBridge can age out
   MAC&VLAN entries if they haven't been used for a certain
   configured period of time or a period of time provided by the
   Directory. Therefore, each edge RBridge will only keep the
   entries that are frequently used, so mapping table size will be
   smaller. Edge RBridges would query the Directory Server(s) for
   unknown MAC-DAs in data frames or ARP/ND and cache the response.
   When end stations attached to remote edge RBridges rarely
   communicate with the locally attached end stations, the
   corresponding MAC&VLAN entries would be aged out from the
   RBridge's cache.

   An RBridge waiting for response from Directory Servers upon
   receiving a data frame with an unknown DA is similar to a L2/L3
   boundary router waiting for ARP/ND response upon receiving an IP
   data frame whose DA is not in the router's IP/MAC cache table.
   Most deployed routers today do hold the packet and send an ARP/ND
   requests to the target upon receiving a packet with IP DA not in
   its IP-MAC cache. When ARP/ND replies are received, the router
   will send the data frame to the target. This practice minimizes
   flooding when targets don't exist in the subnet.

   When the target doesn't exist in the subnet, routers generally
   re-send ARP/ND request a few more times before dropping the
   packets. So, the holding time by routers to wait for ARP/ND
   response can be longer than the time taken by the Pull Model to
   get IP-MAC mapping from directory if target doesn't exist in the
   subnet.

   For RBridges with mapping entries being pushed down from
   directory server, they can be configured to use Pull model for
   targets which don't exist in the mapping data pushed down.

   A separate document will specify the detailed messages and
   mechanism for edge RBridges to pull information from directory
   server(s).

6. Conclusion and Recommendation

    The traditional RBridge learning approach of observing data
    plane will have difficulty keep pace with the ever growing
    number of end stations in Data centers.

    Therefore, TRILL should provide a directory assisted approach.
    This document describes the basic framework of using a directory
    assisted approach for RBridge edge nodes. More detailed
    mechanisms will be described in separate drafts.

7. Security Considerations

    Accurate mapping of IP addresses into MAC addresses is important
    to the correct delivery of information. The security of specific
    directory assisted mechanisms will be discussed in the document
    or documents specifying those mechanisms.

    For general TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6325].

8. IANA Considerations
