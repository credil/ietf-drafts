1. Introduction 

   This draft proposes ALTO information model and protocol extensions 
   to support application and network resource information exchange for 
   high bandwidth applications in partially controlled and controlled 
   environments as part of the infrastructure to application 
   information exposure (i2aex) initiative. The Controlled and 
   partially controlled ALTO environments referred to here are those 
   where general access to a specific ALTO server may be restricted to 
   a qualified list of clients.  

    

   This draft is build upon the previously introduced High Bandwidth 
   Use Cases [HighBW]. In [HighBW], we have discussed two generic use 
   cases that motivate the usefulness of general interfaces for cross 
   stratum optimization in the network core. In our first use case, 
   network resource usage became significant due to the aggregation of 
   many individually unique client demands. In the second use case 
   where data centers are sending large amount of data with each other, 
   bandwidth usage was already significant enough to warrant the use of 
   traffic engineered "express lanes" (e.g., private line service). We 
   introduce third use case where inter-CDN providers may want to 
   expose controlled network resource usage information so that CDN 
   applications (e.g., request routing server) can utilize such 
   information when appropriate decisions (e.g., request routing 
   redirection) are needed.  

   These use cases result in optimization problems that trade off 
   computational versus network costs and constraints. Both featured 
   use cases show the usefulness of an ALTO interface between the 
   application and network strata in optimizing the networked 
   applications.  

   In particular, this draft introduces: (i) enhanced constraints 
   filtering extensions to the ALTO protocol to reduce extraneous 
   information transfer and enhance information hiding from the 
   network's perspective; (ii) constrained cost graph mechanism 
   encoding that enables enhanced application traffic optimization that 
   was introduced by [HighBW]. 

   In controlled and partially controlled environments in which 
   operators are willing to share additional network stratum resource 
   information such as bandwidth constraints or additional cost types 
   of topology (e.g., graph or summary), it can be useful to reduce the 
   amount of information transferred from the ALTO server to the ALTO 
   client.

   In considering information exchange between the application stratum 
   and the network stratum, especially from the network stratum to the 
   application stratum, the degree of information details is one of the 
   key concerns from the network providers' standpoint. On the one 
   hand, the network information has to be useful to the application; 
   on the other hand, the provided network information should hide 
   details about the network. In order to achieve these desired goals, 
   a simple enhancement to ALTO protocol would help significantly both 
   in reducing/filtering the amount of information and in increasing 
   the usefulness of the information from network to application.  

   Figure 1 shows ALTO Client-Server Architecture for Application-
   Network information Exchange. Figure 1 shows that ALTO Client in the 
   application stratum can interface with ALTO Server in the network 
   stratum. With this architecture, a simple ALTO query mechanism from 
   application (via ALTO client) to network (via ALTO server) can be 
   implemented. According to this architecture, ALTO Client is assumed 
   to interact with the Application Orchestrator that has the knowledge 
   of the end-user (i.e., source) application requirement, Data Center 
   locations (i.e., destinations) and their resource information.

   The Application Orchestration functions depicted in Figure 1 
   interfacing data centers and end-users are out of the scope of this 
   document. For simplicity purpose, Figure 1 doesn't depict the 
   detailed relationship between ALTO client and server.  In fact, both 
   client and server don't need to be in the same administration 
   boundary.  It can be inter-operator and one to many relationships.  
   For example, in the cases of inter-CDN environment or generic multi-
   domain environment, ALTO client represents a request routing server 
   of upstream CDN operator and it interacts with multiple downstream 
   CDN operators for their network resource information to make 
   efficient decisions for desired quality CDN services.  Interaction 
   methods can either iterative or recursive.  That is, ALTO client can 
   interact with multiple ALTO servers directly or ALTO client can 
   interact with one representative ALTO server and subsequent 
   interaction is done by the representative one to rest of ALTO 
   servers. 

   The organization of this document is as follows. Section 2 discusses 
   the ALTO architecture in the context of the application and network 
   strata interaction. Section 3 provides ALTO Information model and 
   protocol extension to support ALTO Constraints Filtering Mechanism. 
   Section 4 provides ALTO information model and the protocol extension 
   to support ALTO Constrained Cost Graph Mechanism.  

2. Problem Statement 

   One critical issue in Application-Network information exchange in 
   ALTO is the amount of information exchanged between the application 
   and network strata. The information provided by network providers 
   can be not so useful to the application stratum unless such 
   information is abstracted into an appropriate level the that 
   application stratum can understand.  

   In partially controlled and controlled environments, network 
   providers can furnish appropriately abstracted and pruned 
   information to the application stratum with the cooperation of the 
   application stratum that can indicate some level of filtering and 
   pruning in its query.   

   To reduce extraneous information this draft allows for "filtering" 
   (or "pruning") of the following information in query/response of the 
   ALTO pull model: 

      . Topology Filtering - reduction of the results to only those 
         specified set of source(s) and destination(s) instead of the 
         entire network cost map. Note that this mechanism is not new 
         in the current ALTO protocol. In the context of application-
         network information exchange, this topology filtering can be 
     

   Lee & Bernstein      Expires July 8, 2013 [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft Application and Network Information Exchange January 2013 
    

         of a tremendous help in reducing the amount of data exchanged 
         between application and network.  
      . Constraint Filtering on paths or graphs (e.g., bandwidth, 
         latency, hop count, packet loss, etc.) - reduction of results 
         to only those that meet ALTO client specified cost bounds. 

 

   As discussed in [HighBW], in a controlled environment optimization 
   is significantly enhanced by sharing data related to bandwidth 
   constraints and additional cost measures [MultiCost].  Such 
   information may be considered sensitive to the network provider just 
   as application data, e.g., usage, demand, etc., may be considered 
   sensitive to an application provider. Section 3 provides ALTO 
   information model and protocol extensions to support 
   topology/constraints filtering mechanism.  

   While it is important to reduce and filter the information amount 
   from network to application, for some applications that require 
   stringent QoS objectives (e.g., bandwidth and latency), simple 
   summary source-destination network resource information (i.e., 
   summary form of topology) may not provide sufficient details to the 
   application stratum. For example, suppose that a multiple number of 
   large concurrent flows need to be scheduled from application to 
   network. In such a case, a summary form of network topology that 
   only shows source-destination bandwidth availability may not show 
   the bottleneck links over which more than one flow may compete for 
   the link bandwidth resource. This problem was indicated by [HighBW]. 
   The following are the excerpts from [HighBW]. 

   Consider the network shown in Figure 2, where DC indicates a 
   datacenter, ER an end user region (as in the end user aggregation 
   use case), N a switching node of some sort, and L a link. The link 
   capacities and costs are also shown on the figure as well as a cost 
   map between [ER1, ER2] and [DC1, DC2, DC3]. Since the network has a 
   tree structure (very unusual but easier to draw in ASCII art), the 
   cost map is unique. 

   As an illustration, assume that the maximum available capacity 
   between any individual end region and a data center is 5 units(i.e., 
   L1=L2=L5=L6=5). However, link L3 (capacity 8 units) represents a 
   bottle neck to all the data centers (L3 is on all the paths to DC1, 
   DC2, or DC3 from all end regions, ER1 and ER2).  

   ALTO Cost Map is shown in the lower right corner of Figure 2. This 
   summary cost map does not provide enough details on the bottle 
   necks. The lower left corner shows Link Capacity Cost, from which

   the bottle necks can be shown such that multi-flow commodity 
   scheduling can be made possible to avoid such bottle necks.

   With the current ALTO cost map structure, the least cost path from 
   ER1 would be either to DC1 or DC2. However, with the proposed 
   capacitated cost map, the connection from ER1 to DC3 could be a 
   better choice than the rest depending on the relative cost of 
   network resources to data center resources. 

   A more general and relatively efficient alternative is to provide 
   the requestor with a capacitated and multiply weighted graph that 
   approximates and abstracts the capabilities of the network as seen 
   by the source and destination location sets. This document provides 
   ALTO information model and protocol extensions to support the graph 
   model in Section 4.  

 

3. ALTO Constraints Filtering Extension Model  

3.1. ALTO Query from Application Stratum to Network Stratum  

   In order for the network stratum to provide its resource 
   information, the application stratum needs to provide the End Point 

     

   Lee & Bernstein      Expires July 8, 2013 [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft Application and Network Information Exchange January 2013 
    

   Cost Map to the network stratum. The End Point Cost Map should 
   include the following information at a minimum: 

     . End Point Source Address(es) /* these are the respective 
        addresses of the nearest PE's to the user/client location */ 

     . End Point Destination Address(es) /* these are the respective 
        addresses of the nearest PE's to a set of the candidate Data 
        Center locations that can provide service to the user request. 
        */ 

   Note that how ALTO client derives the End Point Source/Destination 
   addresses in terms of the nearest PE's is beyond the scope of this 
   document.  

     . Cost Type:= 'routingcost' as defined by base specification. 
        Additional cost (ex. latency, hopcount) are defined in 
        [MultiCost]. 

     . Cost Mode :={summary, graph} /* the cost map can be either a 
        summary form or a graph form */ 

          o Cost Mode: summary 

             This cost mode is indicated by string 'summary'. This mode 
             indicates that the returned costs contain constraints 
             values which can be used by application stratum for better 
             selection of resources. 

          o Cost Mode: gragh 

             This cost mode is indicated by string 'gragh'. [TBD] 

     . Constraints /* a set of constraints that apply to the requested 
        path summary or graph for filtering. For instance, constraints 
        can be like bandwidth greater than 'x', latency less than 'y', 
        hopcount less than 'z', packetloss less than 'a' etc. */ 

     . Objective-function: The summary or the graph should be computed 
        based on optimizing which parameter - IGP cost, latency, 
        residual bandwidth, etc. This is for future use. 

    

3.2. ALTO Response from Network Stratum to Application Stratum 

   In response to the ALTO Query from the Application Stratum, the 
   Network Stratum needs to provide the filtered Cost Map Data of the

   feasible path found. The Filtered End Cost Map Data should include 
   the following information at a minimum: 

     . The list of feasible Source-Destination pair and its Cost Type   

     . For each feasible S-D pair, indicate the following: 

     . Constraints Values /* indicate the actual values of each 
        constraint requested */

   For each source endpoint, a CsoEndpointDstCosts object denotes the 
   associated "cost + constraints" to each destination endpoint 
   specified in the input parameters; the name for each member in the 
   object is the TypedEndpointAddr string identifying the corresponding 
   destination endpoint. This can be viewed as a two dimensional array 
   which holds cost + constraints value. 
    

    

3.5. ALTO Protocol Extension for Constraints Filtering Mechanism  

   This section provides the ALTO protocol extensions based on the 
   information model discussed in Sections 3.3. and 3.4. The scenario 
   provided in this section is that the ALTO client in the Application 
   Stratum requests the summary cost map from the network with one 
   source and three destinations.  

   In this particular example, the ALTO client requests the filtered 
   summary of the network path subject to:  bandwidth >= 20, latency < 
   10, hop count < 5 and packet loss < 0.03.  

   The ALTO server provides the resulted network paths in summary.

4. ALTO Protocol Extension for Graph Representation Mechanism  

4.1. Representing bandwidth constraints  

   object { 
     LinkEntry [LinkName]<0..*>; 
   } CostConstraintGraphData; 
    
   object { 
     PIDName:    a-end; // Node name at one side of the link 
     PIDName:    z-end; // Node name at the other side of the link 
     Weight:     wt;

     JSONNumber: latency; 
     Capacity:   r-cap; // Reservable capacity 
   } LinkEntry; 
    

   Where a link name is formatted like a PIDName (but names a link), 
   and PID names are used for both provider defined location and 
   provider defined internal model node identification. A graph 
   representation of the network of Figure 2 might look like: 

   { 
     "meta" : {}, 
     "data" : { 
       "graph": { 
         "L1": {"a-end":"ER1", "z-end":"N1", "wt":1,"r-cap":5}, 
         "L2": {"a-end":"ER2", "z-end":"N1", "wt":2,"r-cap":5}, 
         "L3": {"a-end":"N1", "z-end":"N2", "wt":1,"r-cap":8}, 
         "L4": {"a-end":"N2", "z-end":"N3", "wt":2,"r-cap":6}, 
         "L5": {"a-end":"N3", "z-end":"DC1", "wt":1,"r-cap":5}, 
         "L6": {"a-end":"N3", "z-end":"DC2", "wt":1,"r-cap":5}, 
         "L7": {"a-end":"N2", "z-end":"DC3", "wt":6,"r-cap":10} 
       } 
     }
