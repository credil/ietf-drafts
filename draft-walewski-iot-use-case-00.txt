1.  List of abbreviations

   IoT-A: Internet of Things Architecture; EU research project (2010-
   2013).


2.  Introduction

   The Internet of Things is an emerging technology which is
   characterized by a pronounced heterogeneity and richness of
   envisioned usage domains.  Due to this heterogeneity not all
   protocols developed for the !otraditional!+/- Internet will be
   applicable, and suits of new solutions will be required.  In order to
   devise such solutions a thorough study of the application domain, as
   well as the pertinent requirements is needed.  This RFC is intended
   as a digest for such overviews.


3.   Use cases and requirements

3.1.  Some words on requirements engineering within IoT-A

   The majority of the requirements referenced in this RFC were derived
   within the project Internet-of-Things Architecture (IoT-A), which
   started in September 2010 and will provide its final reports in
   August 2013.  An important part of the IoT-A research agenda is to
   compile a comprehensive list of requirements for the IoT.  These can
   loosely be separated into three categories: stakeholder requirements;
   requirements derived from the state of the art, and requirements
   provided by the project partners.  Requirements from stakeholder
   outside IoT-A were collected during a stakeholder workshop in October
   2010.  These use cases were included !oas they are!+/- in a project
   deliverable [Pastor, 2010].  This deliverable also outlines the
   requirements-engineering process employed in IoT-A.  After this
   workshop, these requirements were rephrased as system requirements
   and classified by the labels !otechnical!+/- and !onon-technical!+/-.
   Furthermore, they were grouped by perspectives and views.  A preview
   of the refined requirements were provided in another project
   deliverable [Salinas, 2010], and a finalized list was provided in the
   recently published !oInitial Architectural Reference Model for
   IoT!+/- [Bauer, 2011].  The latter document also contains a
   preliminary list of requirements based on project-partner input and
   the state of the art.
