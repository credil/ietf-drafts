    Route Leaks -- Requirements for Detection and Prevention thereof
                 draft-dickson-sidr-route-leak-reqts-00

Abstract

   The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the means to
   advertise reachability for IP prefixes.  This reachability
   information is propagated in a peer-to-peer topology.  Sometimes
   routes are announced to peers for which the local peering policy does
   not permit.  And sometimes routes are propagated indiscriminantly,
   once they have been accepted.

   This document considers the situations that can lead to routes being
   leaked, and tries to find acceptable definitions for describing these
   scenarios.

   The purpose of these definitions is to facilitate discussion on what
   a route leak is, and what the scope of the problem space for route
   leaks is.  This, in turn, is intended to inform a requirements
   document for detection of (and prevention of) route leaks.  And
   finally, the definitions and requirements are intended to allow
   proposed solutions which meet these criteria, and to facilitate
   evaluation of proposed solutions.

   The fundamental objective is to "solve the route leaks problem".
