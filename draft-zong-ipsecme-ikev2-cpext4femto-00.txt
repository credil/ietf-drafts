IKEv2 Configuration Payload Extension for Notarizing Femtocell in Mobile
                              Core Network
              draft-zong-ipsecme-ikev2-cpext4femto-00.txt

Abstract

   IPSec IKEv2, RFC 5996 [RFC5996], has been adopted by many
   standardized network solutions to provide the secure transport
   between network elements over third party's infrastructure.  Today
   Femtocell deployment requires the mobile operator's Femtocell AP
   (FAP) to leverage the IPSec IKEv2 to support mutual authentication
   and data protection between the insecure Femtocell, which typically
   deployed in customer's premise, and its corresponding mobile core
   network.

   A known security threat exists in Femto architecture for failing to
   validate the FAP's identity and information provided by FAP at the
   mobile operator's core network.

   This document reviews this security threat and proposes a simple
   extension of the IKEv2 to resolve the issue.

1.  Introduction

   Today many network solutions leverage the IPSec IKEv2 to provide the
   secure transport as well as some form remote configuration support
   for their network elements over third party infrastructure (e.g.
   ADSL, Cable etc.).

   The standardized Femtocell architecture from Femto Forum as well as
   from many mobile standards (e.g. 3GPP, 3GPP2 and WiMAX) are good
   examples that all have common architecture to leverage the IPSec
   IKEv2 to interconnect the Femtocell AP (FAP) with the Security
   Gateway (SeGW).

   In typical Femtocell deployment, the FAP is mutually authenticated
   with the Security Gateway (SeGW) (e.g. via IKEv2 with public key
   signature based authentication with certificates).  Hence, the SeGW
   knows the real identity of the FAP.  However, since there is no
   interface between the SeGW and Operator's core network elements, the
   operator's core network will depend on the information provided by
   the FAP which is transparent to the intermediate SeGW to proceed
   network operation decisions.  A compromised FAP may present false
   information (e.g. a wrong Closed Subscriber Group Identity (CSG ID)
   or false access mode for 3GPP defined mobile network architecture) to
   the mobile operator's core network that could not be able to validate
   in order to influence the wrong system behavior in the network.

   A solution to address the above security gap is to have the SeGW
   which has the ability to validate the FAP to notarize the FAP
   information and generate a notarized signature.  When the FAP needs
   to provide FAP information to the operator's core network, the FAP
   sends the FAP information together with the notarized signature
   certified by SeGW.  The operator's core network can then verify the
   FAP information by validating the SeGW's notarized signature.

   The following presents the generic Femtocell architecture and an
   example of Femtocell network configuration defined by 3GPP.

   is used to support the authentication between the FAP and SeGW via
   IKEv2 EAP.

   Since in Femto architecture, the device and server configuration are
   used and hence IPSec tunnel based on tunnel mode is established over
   the ISP which is considered as insecure link between FAP and SeGW.
   This IPSec tunnel is used to protect the transport of mobile operator
   specific signaling information exchange and its mobile subscriber's
   traffic.

2.  Terminology

   Femtocell

   Femtocell is a low-powered wireless access point that operates in
   licensed spectrum to connect standard mobile devices to a mobile
   operator's networking using residential broadband connections.

   FAP

   Femtocell Access Point, a FAP is typically designed in home or
   enterprise environment.

   Femto GW

   Femtocell Gateway, is the concentrate point of multiple FAPs.

   Femto Management

   Femto Management is the management system used to manage FAP.

   SeGW

   A Security Gateway provides secure termination and aggregation for
   users and signaling traffic to reach the mobile operator's core
   network.  Examples of functions provided by Security Gateway are
   IPSec Encryption, DoS Mitigation, Dynamic Session Security and Real-
   time Bandwidth management to provide security for mobile operators'
   networks and their users.

   H(e)NB

   Home (evolved) Node B, the FAP defined by 3GPP, supports 2nd or 3rd
   generation radio mode or LTE radio mode.  It's called HNB when it
   supports 2nd or 3rd generation radio mode, and HeNB when it supports
   LTE radio mode.

   H(e)NB GW

   H(e)NB GW is the concentrate point of H(e)NBs, it controls the H(e)NB
   registration, and handles 3GPP specific signaling.

   H(e)MS

   H(e)NB management system, the H(e)MS is used to send configuration
   parameters to the H(e)NB and to manage the H(e)NB by the mobile
   operator.

3.  Problem Statement

   There is a recent study identifying a security threat in Femtocell
   architecture for failing to validate the FAP's identity and
   information provided by FAP at the mobile operator's core network.

   In Femtocell architecture, an IPSec tunnel will be established
   between the SeGW and the FAP.  This IPSec tunnel will be used to
   protect the transport of the signaling between the FAP and the
   operator's core network, as well as user packets.  The signaling
   between the FAP and the operator's core network is encapsulated in
   the inner IP packet of the IPSec tunnel and is transparent to the
   SeGW.

   After successful mutual authentication between the FAP and the SeGW,
   the operator's core network does not verify the FAP information sent
   by the FAP.  This introduces a security threat when a FAP is
   compromised (e.g. impersonation), by injecting false information to
   the mobile operator's core network over the established IPSec tunnel
   with SeGW.

   Since FAP is resided at the untrusted domain (i.e. customer premise),
   whereas SeGW is the trusted gateway entry to the core network domain,
   and given the mutual authenticated relationship between the SeGW and
   the FAP, hence, it would be reliable to have the SeGW to certify all
   the information that is sent by the FAP prior to the core network to
   process the information.

   Unfortunately, in today generic and even technology specific FAP
   architecture, SeGW has no standardized interface to the mobile core
   network entities which perform the UE access control based on the FAP
   information.  One of the main reasons is because SeGW is not specific
   designed for FAP deployment and hence, there is no justification to
   define specific interface to the mobile network entities.  Never-the-
   less, it is outside the scope of this document to discuss the
   motivation behind such architecture decision.

   Besides, given the existing deployment for FAP for mobile operator,
   it is too late to change the existing architecture which will
   introduce backward incompatibility for the network configuration.
   The most desirable solution to resolve the issue is by software
   upgrade with a backward compatible simple change.

4.  Proposed Solution - Extension to IKEv2 Configuration Payload

   A simple solution that is proposed to resolve this issue is to
   notarize the FAP information by the SeGW once the SeGW verifies the
   identity of the FAP.  The notarized signature for the FAP information
   will be feedback to the FAP using the secured Configuration Payload
   (CP) as defined by IKEv2 today.  The FAP will then send the FAP
   information together with the corresponding SeGW notarized signature
   to its mobile operator's core network.  The core network verifies the
   FAP information by validating the SeGW notarized signature prior to
   the acceptance of the information.

   This solution requires minimum changes to the existing RFC 5996
   [RFC5996] - Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) to
   provide a standardized solution, and it does not introduce any
   backward incompatibility issue to the existing RFC, the existing
   specification, the existing architecture and the existing
   implementation.

   The details on how to derive the SeGW notarized signature will not be
   defined by IETF as the IKEv2 CP is just used as a carriage to
   transport the signature.  It is within scope of the mobile operators
   to work with their SeGW vendors to define their own algorithm of how
   the signature is computed.

   The existing IKEv2 Configuration Payload (CP) is extended to allow
   the IKE-initiator to specify the information that is required to be
   notarized, and to allow the IKE-responder (i.e.  SeGW) to insert the
   notarized signature of the FAP information into the CP to be sent
   back to the IKE-initiator (i.e.  FAP) after the peers are
   successfully mutually authenticated.

   The major advantages of this proposal are as follows:

   o  Simple extension to the existing IKEv2 RFC 5996 [RFC5996]

      *  only a new code point is required to be defined for the CP to
         indicate the carriage of the SeGW's notarized signature of the
         FAP information

   o  No impact to the existing security mechanisms for the end-to-end
      system and the existing protocols

      *  FAP (i.e.  IKE-initiator) has signaling path with operator's
         core network to pass the FAP information and the signature.

      *  CP is part of the IKEv2 parameters which is generally supported
         by existing FAP-SeGW IPSec/IKEv2 authentication procedures.

Internet-Draft                 cpext4femto                  January 2012


      *  Each CP is designed to be standalone and orthogonal to each
         other, and hence, no concern for backward incompatibility to
         the existing IKEv2 procedures that are supported by the FAP.

   o  Fully compatibility to the existing architecture and procedures

      *  the new added code point has no impact to the IKEv2
         Configuration Payload to continue the use of the existing IKEv2
         security mechanism.

     +----------------------------+-------+--------------+-----------+
     | Attribute Type             | Value | Multi-Valued | Length    |
     +----------------------------+-------+--------------+-----------+
     | CLIENT_NOTARIZED_INFO      | 16    | No           | 0 or more |
     | SERVER_NOTARIZED_SIGNATURE | 17    | No           | 0 or more |
     +----------------------------+-------+--------------+-----------+

   CLIENT_NOTARIZED_INFO - This info is provided by the initiator which
   is operated as a client in the IPSEC tunnel mode.  The client
   provides the information that requires the server to notarize in the
   CFG_REQUEST so that the notarized signature can be validated by the
   3rd party to verify the client's true identity and the information
   that is provided by the client.  More details are described in 4.1.1.

   SERVER NOTARIZED SIGNATURE - This signature is generated only by the
   responder which is operated as a server in the IPSEC tunnel mode.
   The responder notarizes the information provided by the initiator
   received over the CFG_REQUEST.  If both the initiator and responder
   are mutually authenticated, the responder generates the notarized
   signature based on the information provided by the initiator and the
   signature will be inserted in CFG_REPLY.  More details are described
   in 4.1.2.

4.1.1.  Configuration Payloads for CLIENT_NOTARIZED_INFO

   The Configuration payload is used by the IKE initiator to request its
   corresponding IKE responder via the CFG_REQUEST to notarize the info
   that is carried by this payload.  The exact content of this CP and
   the algorithm of the notarize operation to generate the signature is
   outside the scope of IETF.

   A minimal exchange might look like this:

   CP(CFG_REQUEST) = CLIENT_NOTARIZED_INFO(xx....)

4.1.2.  Configuration Payloads for SERVER_NOTARIZED_SIGNATURE

   The Configuration payload is used by the IKE responder to respond its
   corresponding IKE initiator via the CFG_REPLY to carry the notarized
   client's info by this payload.  The exact content of this CP and the
   algorithm of the notarize operation to generate the signature is
   outside the scope of IETF.

5.  IANA Considerations

   A new code point for IKEv2 Configuration Payload that indicates the
   new contents containing the SeGW notarized signature for the FAP
   information are required to be registered with IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


6.  Security Considerations

   The proposed solution is to add a new code point to the already
   defined IKEv2 Configuration Payload with no change to the existing
   IKEv2 security mechanism that has been used to protect the CP.


7.  Conclusion

   This document explains the issues for the lack of the support in the
   mobile operator's core network to validate the FAP's identity and its
   corresponding FAP information.

   This document discusses the requirements and presents the
   justification of the proposed solution to resolve the issue as
   described above.  The proposed solution requires only simple
   extension to the IKEv2 Configuration Payload as defined in RFC 5996
   [RFC5996] to carry the SeGW's notarized signature of the FAP
   information inserted by the SeGW (i.e.  IKE-responder) and to be
   feedback to the FAP (i.e.  IKE-initiator).  The proposed solution is
   fully backward compatible to the existing RFC, FAP system
   architecture, signaling procedures and existing SeGW's
   implementation.
