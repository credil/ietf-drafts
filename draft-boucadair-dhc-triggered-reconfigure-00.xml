    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a companion solution to the RSOO
      (Relay-Supplied Options option) procedure to trigger a DHCPv6 server to
      issue a RECONFIGURE message. This document defines a new DHCPv6 messages
      type: RECONFIGURE-REQUEST. This message is issued by a relay agent to
      notify a DHCPv6 server a change has occurred in the configuration
      supplied in an RSOO.</t>

      <section anchor="problem" title="Problem">
        <t><xref target="RFC6422"></xref> updates DHCPv6 specification <xref
        target="RFC3315"></xref> with a new feature to let a DHCPv6 relay
        agent communicate information not available at the DHCPv6 server to a
        DHCPv6 client. This is achieved owing to the use of RSOO
        (Relay-Supplied Options option) which carries configuration data to
        the DHCPv6 server. The data conveyed in an RSOO is then sent back by
        the DHCPv6 server to the requesting DHCPv6 client.</t>

        <t>An illustration example is shown in <xref target="ex1"></xref>;
        only a subset of exchanged messages are represented.</t>

        <t>In the event of the change of the configuration data supplied to
        the DHCPv6 server by the DHCPv6 relay agent, DHCPv6 server has no
        trigger to issue a Reconfigure message with the updated configuration
        data. A solution is sketched in <xref target="solution"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="solution" title="Proposed Solution">
      <t>To solve the problem described in <xref target="problem"></xref>,
      this document proposes a new DHCP message called Reconfigure-Request.
      This message is sent by the DHCPv6 relay agent to a DHCPv6 server when a
      configuration data already supplied in an RSOO is detected. In
      particular, Reconfigure-Request must include RSOO with the new
      configuration. Upon receipt of this message, and if it is configured to
      support such mode, the DHCPv6 server must build a Reconfigure message
      which copies the data conveyed in RSOO. This message is sent to the
      DHCPv6 relay and then relayed to the appropriate DHCPv6 client.</t>

      <t>This setup assumes the relay has a record of the client, so it has
      enough information to send the request to the server. Means to recover
      state in failure events must be supported.</t>

      <t>An example is depicted in <xref target="ex3"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Creation and Transmission of RECONFIGURE-REQUEST">
        <t>In the event of change of an information which has been supplied to
        the DHCPv6 server, the relay agent determines the client which is
        concerned by the change and then builds a Reconfigure-Request message:
        the relay agent sets the "msg-type" field to RECONFIFURE-REQUEST and
        sets the "transaction-id" field to 0. The relay agent MUST supply the
        updated configuration in RSOO as defined in <xref
        target="RFC6422"></xref> and MUST include an OPTION_CLIENTID option

      <section title="Server Behaviour">
        <t>Upon receipt of a valid Reconfigure-Request message from a DHCPv6

        of <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> and Section 4 of <xref
        target="RFC6422"></xref> to construct a Reconfigure message. </t>
