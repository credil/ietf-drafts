 Simulating "Partial Mesh of MP2MP P-Tunnels" with Ingress Replication
        draft-zzhang-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-ingress-replication-00.txt

Abstract

   RFC 6513 described a method to support bidirectional C-flow using
   "Partial Mesh of MP2MP P-Tunnels".  This document describes how
   partial mesh of MP2MP P-Tunnels can be simulated with Ingress
   Replication, instead of a real MP2MP tunnel.

Internet-Draft           C-Bidir support with IR               June 2013


1.  Introduction

   Section 11.2 of RFC 6513, "Partitioned Sets of PEs", describes two
   methods of carrying bidirectional C-flow traffic over a provider core
   without using the core as RPL or requiring Designated Forwarder
   election.

   With these two methods, all PEs of a particular VPN are separated
   into partitions, with each partition being all the PEs that elect the
   same PE as the UMH wrt the C-RPA.  A PE must discard bidirectional
   C-flow traffic from PEs that are not in the same partition as the PE
   itself.

   In particular, Section 11.2.3 of RFC 6513, "Partial Mesh of MP2MP
   P-Tunnels", guarantees the above discard havavior without using an
   extra PE Distinguisher label by having all PEs in the same partition
   join a single MP2MP tunnel dedicated to that partition and use it to
   transmit traffic.  All traffic arriving on the tunnel will be from
   PEs in the same partition, so it will be always accepted.

   RFC 6514 specifies BGP encodings and procedures used to implement
   MVPN as specified in RFC 6513, while the details related to MP2MP
   tunnels are specified in [draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05].

   [draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05] assumes that an MP2MP P-tunnel is
   realized either via PIM-Bidir, or via MP2MP mLDP.  Each of them would
   require signaling and state not just on PEs, but on the P routers as
   well.  This document describes how the MP2MP tunnel can be simulated
   with a mesh of P2P or MP2P LSPs, i.e.  Ingress Replication.  The
   advantage is that existing P2P/MP2P LSPs created for unicast can be
   used for multicast as well w/o introducing additional signaling or
   state in the core.  While there may be concerns with traffic
   replication in the core, in many situations the traffic could be low-
   rate and/or sporadic and the advantage of signaling and state savings
   will outweight the concerns with traffic replication, making Ingress
   Replication an applicable and attractive alternative.

   This documentation specifies the BGP signaling and procedures used to
   simulate "Partial Mesh of MP2MP P-Tunnels" with Ingress Replication.

3.  Operation

3.1.  Control State

   If a PE, say PEx, is connected to a site of a given VPN, and that
   site hosts the C-RPA for some Bidir-PIM groups, i.e., the route to
   the C-RPA is through a local PE-CE interface, then PEx MUST
   advertises a (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route, regardless of whether it
   has any local Bidir-PIM join states corresponding to the C-RPA
   learned from its CEs.  It MAY also advertise a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI
   A-D route, just like how any other S-PMSI A-D routes are triggered
   (e.g, when the (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) traffic rate goes above a threshold).
   Here the C-G-BIDIR refers to a C-G where G is a Bidir-PIM group, and
   the corresponding C-RPA is in the site that the PEx connects to.

   The S-PMSI A-D routes include a Provider Tunnel Attribute (PTA) with
   tunnel type set to Ingress Replication, with Leaf Information
   Required flag set, and with a downstream allocated MPLS label that
   other PEs in the same partition MUST use when sending relevant
   C-bidir flows to this PE.

   If some other PE, PEy, receives and imports into one of its VRFs such
   a (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route, and the VRF has any local Bidir-PIM
   join state that PEy has received from its CEs, and if PEy chooses PEx
   as its UMH wrt the C-RPA for those states, PEy MUST advertise a Leaf
   A-D route in response.  Or, if PEy has received and imported into one
   of its VRFs a (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route from PEx before, then
   upon receiving in the VRF any local Bidir-PIM join state from its CEs
   with PEx being the UMH for those states' C-RPA, PEy MUST advertise a
   Leaf A-D route.

   The encoding of the Leaf A-D route is as specified in RFC 6514,
   except that the Route Targets are set to the same value as in the
   corresponding S-PMSI A-D route so that the Leaf A-D route will be
   imported by all VRFs that import the corresponding S-PMSI A-D route.
   This is irrespective of whether from a receiving PE, PEz's
   perspective PEx (oiginator of the S-PMSI A-D route) is the UMH PE or
   not.  The label in the PTA of the Leaf A-D route originated by PEy
   MUST be allocated specifically for PEx, so that when traffic arrives
   with that label, the traffic can associated with the partition
   (represented by the PEx).

   With PEy advertising Leaf A-D route only if it chooses the originator
   of the S-PMSI A-D route as its UMH, it won't receive traffic from PEs
   in other partitions, so the label is actually useful only when PEy
   switches to a different UMH - it will stop accepting traffic before
   sending PEs stop sending it traffic (upon the receipt of its Leaf A-D
   route withdrawl).  To speed up convergency (so that PEy starts

   receiving traffic from its new UMH immediately instead of waiting
   until the new Leaf A-D route corresponding to the new UMH is received
   by sending PEs), PEy MAY advertise a Leaf A-D route even if does not
   choose PEx as its UMH wrt the C-RPA.  With that, it will receive
   traffic from all PEs, but some will arrive with the label
   corresponding to its choice of UMH while some will arrive with a
   different label, and the traffic in the latter case will be
   discarded.

   Similar to the (C-*,C-BIDIR) case, if PEy receives and imports into
   one of its VRFs such a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route, and PEy
   chooses PEx as its UMH wrt the C-RPA, and it has corresponding local
   (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join state that it has received from its CEs in the
   VRF, PEy MUST advertise a Leaf A-D route in response.  Or, if PEy has
   received and imported into one of its VRFs a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI
   A-D route before, then upon receiving its local (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join
   state from its CEs in the VRF, it MUST advertise a Leaf A-D route.

   The encoding of the Leaf A-D route is as specified in RFC 6514,
   except that the Route Targets are set to the same as in the
   corresponding S-PMSI A-D route so that the Leaf A-D route will be
   imported by all VRFs that import the corresponding S-PMSI A-D route.
   This is irrespective of whether from the receiving PE, PEz's
   perspective PEx (oiginator of the S-PMSI A-D route) is the UMH PE or
   not.  The label in the PTA of the Leaf A-D route originated by PEy
   MUST be allocated specifically for PEx, so that when traffic arrives
   with that label, the traffic can associated with the partition
   (represented by the PEx).

   Whenever the (C-*,C-BIDIR) or (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route is
   withdrawn, or if PEy no longer chooses the originator PEx as its UMH
   wrt C-RPA and PEy only advertises Leaf A-D routes in response to its
   UMH's S-PMSI A-D route, or if relevant local join state is pruned,
   PEy MUST withdraw the corresponding Leaf A-D route.

3.2.  Forwarding State

   The following specification regarding forwarding state matches the
   "When an S-PMSI is a 'Match for Transmission'" and "When an S-PMSI is
   a 'Match for Reception'" rules for "Flat Partitioning" method in
   [draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-bidir-05], except that the rules about
   (C-*,C-*) are not applicable, because this document requires that
   (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D routes are always originated for a VPN that
   supports C-Bidir flows.

   For the (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route that a PEy receives and
   imports into one of its VRFs from its UMH wrt the C-RPA, or if PEy
   itself advertises the S-PMSI A-D route in the VRF, PEy maintains a

Internet-Draft           C-Bidir support with IR               June 2013


   (C-*,C-G-BIDR) forwarding state in the VRF, with the Ingress
   Replication provider tunnel leaves being the originators of the
   S-PMSI A-D route and all relevant Leaf-A-D routes.  The relevant Leaf
   A-D routes are the routes whose Route Key field contains the same
   information as the MCAST-VPN NLRI of the (C-*, C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D
   route advertised by the UMH.

   For the (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route that a PEy receives and
   imports into one of its VRFs from its UMH wrt a C-RPA, or if PEy
   itself advertises the S-PMSI A-D route in the VRF, it maintains
   appropriate forwarding states in the VRF for the ranges of
   bidirectional groups for which the C-RPA is responsible.  The
   provider tunnel leaves are the originators of the S-PMSI A-D route
   and all relevant Leaf-A-D routes.  The relevant Leaf A-D routes are
   the routes whose Route Key field contains the same information as the
   MCAST-VPN NLRI of the (C-*, C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route advertised by
   the UMH.  This is for the so-called "Sender Only Branches" where a
   router only has data to send upstream towards C-RPA but no explicit
   join state for a particular bidirectional group.  Note that the
   traffic must be sent to all PEs (not just the UMH) in the partition,
   because they may have specific (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join states that this
   PEy is not aware of, while there is no corresponding (C-*,C-G-BIDIR)
   S-PMSI A-D and Leaf A-D routes.

   For a (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) join state that a PEy has received from its CEs
   in a VRF, if there is no corresponding (C-*,C-G-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D
   route from its UMH in the VRF, PEy maintains a corresponding
   forwarding state in the VRF, with the provider tunnel leaves being
   the originators of the (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route and all
   relevant Leaf-A-D routes (same as the above Sender Only Branch case).
   The relevant Leaf A-D routes are the routes whose Route Key field
   contains the same information as the MCAST-VPN NLRI of the (C-*,
   C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route originated by the UMH.  If there is no
   (C-*,C-BIDIR) S-PMSI A-D route from its UMH either, then the provider
   tunnel has an empty set of leaves and PEy does not forward relevant
   traffic across the provider network.
