3.  Overview of MAC address learning using ARP

   This document addresses how to build and maintain mapping table at
   the NVE associated with the tenant system through data plane learning
   or control plane.

   Figure 1 shows the example architecture for MAC learning using ARP.
   This example architecture assumes that:

   o  Tenant system A is connecting to VN by attaching to NVE X. Tenant
      System A knows IP address of Tenant System B but does not know MAC
      address of Tenant System B.

   o  Tenant system B is connecting to VN by attaching to NVE Y. Tenant
      System B knows IP address of Tenant System A but does not know MAC
      address of Tenant System A.

   o  NVE X associated with tenant system A doesn't know IP address and
      MAC address of tenant system B.

   o  NVE Y associated with tenant system B doesn't know IP address and
      MAC address of tenant system A.

4.  Possible solutions for MAC learning using ARP Resolution

   MAC addresses of the Tenant systems also can be learnt by NVE through
   data plane and control plane.  The following section outlines several
   examples for MAC learning using ARP resolution.

4.1.  MAC learning using flooding without MAC hiding

   The packet flow and control plane operation for MAC learning are as
   follows:

   o  Tenant system A sends a broadcast ARP message to discover the MAC
      address of Tenant system B. The message contains IP_B in the ARP
      message payload.

   o  The ARP proxy in NVE X, receiving the ARP message, will flood it
      on the overlay network for TESID = <VNID,IP_B,*>.

   o  The ARP message will be intercepted by NVE (i.e., NVE Y) which
      maintain mapping table matching TESID = <VNID,IP_B,*>.  NVE Y,
      will forward the ARP message to tenant system B. Tenant System B
      send ARP reply to tenant system A containing the mapping
      TESID=<VNID,IP_B,MAC_B>.

   o  NVE X intercept ARP reply message and populates the map-table with
      the received entry, then send it to Tenant System A that includes
      MAC_B and IP_B of Tenant System B.

   o  Tenant system A learns MAC_B from the ARP rely message and can now
      send a packet to Tenant system B by including MAC_B, and IP_B, as
      destination addresses.

4.2.  MAC learning using NVE-oracle interaction

   The packet flow and control plane operation for MAC learning are as
   follows:

   o  Tenant System A sends a broadcast ARP message to discover the MAC
      address of Tenant system B. The message contains IP_B in the ARP
      message payload.

   o  NVE A, receiving the ARP message, but rather than flooding it on
      the overlay network sends a Map-Request to the backend Oracle that
      maintains mapping information for entire overlay network for TESID
      = <VNID,IP_B,*>.

   o  The Map-Request is routed by the backend Oracle to NVE Y, that
      will send a Map-Reply back to NVE X containing the mapping

      TESID=<VNID,IP_B,MAC_B>.  Alternatively, depending on the Backend
      Oracle configuration, the backend Oracle may send directly a Map-
      Reply to NVE X.

   o  NVE X populates the map-table with the received entry, and sends
      an ARP-Agent Reply to Tenant System A that includes MAC_B and
      IP_B.

   o  Tenant system A learns MAC_B from the ARP message and can now send
      a packet to Tenant system B by including MAC_B, and IP_B, as
      destination addresses.

4.3.  MAC learning using control plane operation and MAC hiding

   MAC addresses of the Tenant systems also can be learnt by NVE through
   control plane.

   When tenant system A is attached to NVE X, the mapping table
   TESID=<VNID,IP_A,MAC_A> should be populated at the local NVE A. In
   order to enable tenant system A to communicate with any tenant system
   that is not under NVE X, the mapping table should be distributed to
   all the remote NVEs that belong to the same VN even through there is
   no tenant system which communicates with tenant system A behind the
   remote NVE.  In order to achieve this, NVE X should know the list of
   remote NVE that belong to the same VN as NVE X and distribute the
   mapping table to each remote NVE.  Alternatively, backend Oracle may
   know a list of tenant systems that is in communication with tenant
   system A and which remote NVE these tenant systems are attached to.
   So NVE X distribute the mapping table to the backend Oracle which in
   turn determine which remote NVE should populate mapping table and
   distribute mapping table to the corresponding remote NVE.  The packet
   flow for MAC learning in data plane are as follows:

   o  Tenant system A sends a broadcast ARP message to discover the MAC
      address of Tenant system B. The message contains IP_B in the ARP
      message payload.

   o  The ARP proxy in NVE X, will terminate the ARP message, and create
      a ARP reply message, set the inner destination MAC address in the
      inner Ethernet header and sender MAC address in the payload of ARP
      reply message to NVE X's MAC address then send it back to tenant
      system A. Therefore ARP message is restricted within layer 2
      network behind NVE X and will not be flooded to the entire overlay
      network at the outsider of NVE X.

   o  Tenant system A learns MAC_B from the ARP rely message and send a
      packet to Tenant system B by including MAC_X, and IP_B, as
      destination addresses.

   o  NVE X, will intercept the packet from tenant system A and perform
      a lookup operation in its map table for the destination
      TESID=<VNID, IP_B> and determine which tunnel the packet needs to
      be sent to.  Then NVE X encapsulate the packet from tenant system
      A into tunnel header with NVE Y IP_Y as the destination address
      NVE X IP_X as the source address and transmit it across overlay
      network.

   o  NVE Y decapsulates the tunnel packet from NVE X and take out the
      packet from tenant system A and send to the tenant system B.

4.4.  MAC learning using control plane operation without MAC hiding

   MAC addresses of the Tenant systems also can be learnt by NVE through
   control plane.

   When tenant system A is attached to NVE X, the mapping table
   TESID=<VNID,IP_A,MAC_A> should be populated at the local NVE A. In
   order to enable tenant system A to communicate with any tenant system
   that is not under NVE X, the mapping table should be distributed to
   all the remote NVEs that belong to the same VN even through there is
   no tenant system which communicate with tenant system A behind the
   remote NVE.  In order to achieve this, NVE X should know the list of
   remote NVE that belong to the same VN as NVE X and distribute the
   mapping table to each remote NVE.  Alternatively, backend Oracle may
   know a list of tenant systems that is in communication with tenant
   system A and which remote NVE these tenant systems are attached to.
   So NVE X distribute the mapping table to the backend Oracle which in
   turn determine which remote NVE should populate mapping table and
   distribute mapping table to the corresponding remote NVE.  The packet
   flow for MAC learning in data plane are as follows:

   o  Tenant system A sends a broadcast ARP message to discover the MAC
      address of Tenant system B. The message contains IP_B in the ARP
      message payload.

   o  The ARP proxy in NVE X, will terminate the ARP message, and look
      up the MAC_B in the local mapping table send the ARP reply message
      to tenant system A that includes MAC_B and IP_B. Therefore ARP
      message is restricted within layer 2 network behind NVE X and will
      not be flooded to the entire overlay network at the outsider of
      NVE X.

   o  Tenant system A learns MAC_B from the ARP rely message and send a
      packet to Tenant system B by including MAC_B, and IP_B, as
      destination addresses.
