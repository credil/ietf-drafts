           RTP Stream Quality Information Export using IPFIX
                draft-scholz-ipfix-rtp-audio-quality-00

Abstract

   This draft defines a set of Information Elements and matching
   Templates to convey RTP media stream quality information in IPFIX
   packets.  The Information Elements describe the RTP quality using the
   R-factor and Mean Opinion score (MOS) for the entire duration of a
   monitored stream or for a smaller time slice thereof.

Internet-Draft            RTP Streams in IPFIX                 July 2012


1.  Introduction

   IPFIX [RFC5101] and [RFC5102] define a framework allowing to export
   arbitrary data from so called IPFIX exporters.  One type of IPFIX
   exporter may be co-located with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [RFC3261] based VoIP entities or passively observe SIP based VoIP
   calls.  The signaling messages can be exported using
   [I-D.trammell-ipfix-sip-msg] and Real Time Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550]
   media streams are covered in [I-D.akhter-ipfix-perfmon].  Media
   quality is out of the scope of both these documents.  This document
   defines a set of additional IPFIX Information Elements (IEs) to
   describe RTP audio stream quality.

1.1.  Use Cases

   RTP stream flow information contained in IPFIX flow records can be
   used for various tasks such as Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring,
   Service Level Agreement (SLA) validation and general troubleshooting
   of VoIP networks.

1.1.1.  Quality of Service (QoS) Monitoring

   Aggregated to higher-level metrics the in-depth information provided
   by the RTP (and optionally SIP) flow records allow service providers
   to gauge the overall quality of their network in terms of the quality
   of experience (QoE).  On this level an individual call is less
   important but the overall quality (e.g. amount of minutes meeting
   certain quality standards) can be used to get a quick overview on the
   network and service performance.

1.1.2.  Service Level Agreement (SLA)

   SLAs are typically used as part of contracts between two network
   operators.  The requirements on the reliability of the data may be
   higher compared to QoS Monitoring as the failure to meet
   contractually agreed quality standards often has a direct commercial
   impact.

1.1.3.  Troubleshooting

   An active network component (SIP proxy, B2BUA, media server) may not
   have the capabilities to store session related information for a long
   time to facilitate troubleshooting capabilities (e.g. due to missing
   hard-disk).  Such a system or a group of systems may run the metering
   process and export the data to a collector for processing or
   troubleshooting purposes.

Internet-Draft            RTP Streams in IPFIX                 July 2012


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  MOS measurement

   A multitude of Mean Opinion Score (MOS) assessment algorithms have
   been defined of which only one or few may be available to an IPFIX
   Metering Process.  The quality (i.e. accuracy) of these algorithms
   varies and has to be noted when transporting MOS values.

   An IPFIX Metering Process may use these Information Elements to
   convey information on the duration of the stream in which the quality
   fell into the respective category as well as the measurement
   algorithm used to obtain the information.

3.1.  rtpMOSCAlg

   The values carried in this IE are taken from the "RTCP XR QoE metric
   block - Calculation Algorithm" sub-registry of the "RTP Control
   Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry" as defined
   in [I-D.wu-xrblock-rtcp-xr-quality-monitoring].

   Even when an algorithm other than G.107 is used the rtpMOSClassN
   Information Elements use the R-Factor based classes as defined in the
   G.107 documentation.

   Description:  The calculation algorithm (CAlg) used by the Metering
      Process to calculate the MOS value.

      0: undefined: The algorithm is not known/specified.

      1: ITU-T P.564

      2: G.107

      3: G.107 / ETSI TS 101 329-5 Annex E

4.  Recommended Templates

   The defined RTP stream IPFIX templates must support both IPv4 and
   IPv6 transport.  They need to carry either flow information regarding
   the entire duration of an RTP stream or specific to a shorter
   observation interval.

   The template incorporates IEs from [I-D.akhter-ipfix-perfmon] to
   describe the RTP stream.

   In order to correlate the RTP quality information with signaling
   information (e.g. subscriber IDs) a correlation ID may be added to
   the template.  Note that this ID has yet to be defined and is outside
   the scope of this document.

4.1.  Entire stream

   tbd

4.2.  Time slice

   tbd, based on previous template.  Split a single RTP stream in three
   flow records as example including (empty) 'RTP stream ended' flow
   record.
