                   Requirements for Energy Management
                    draft-ietf-eman-requirements-06

Abstract

   This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
   energy management.  The requirements defined in this document concern
   monitoring functions as well as control functions.  In detail, the
   focus of the requirements is on the following features:
   identification of powered entities, monitoring of their power state,
   power inlets, power outlets, actual power, power properties, consumed
   energy, and contained batteries.  Further requirements are included
   to enable control of powered entities' power supply and power state.
   This document does not specify the features that must be implemented
   by compliant implementations but rather features that must be
   supported by standards for energy management.

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


1.  Introduction

   With rising energy cost and with an increasing awareness of the
   ecological impact of running IT equipment, energy management is
   becoming an additional basic requirement for network devices and
   associated network management systems.

   This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
   energy management, both monitoring functions and control functions.
   In detail, the requirements listed are focused on the following
   features: identification of powered entities, monitoring of their
   power state, power inlets, power outlets, actual power, power
   properties, consumed energy, and contained batteries.  Further
   included is control of powered entities' power supply and power
   state.

   The main subject of energy management is powered entities that
   consume electric energy.  Powered entities include devices that have
   an IP address and can be addressed directly, such as hosts, routers,
   and middleboxes, as well as devices indirectly connected to an IP
   network, for which a proxy with an IP address provides a management
   interface, for example, devices in building infrastructure using
   non-IP protocols.

   These requirements concern the standards specification process and
   not the implementation of specified standards.  All requirements in
   this document must be reflected by standards specifications to be
   developed.  However, which of the features specified by these
   standards will be mandatory, recommended, or optional for compliant
   implementations is to be defined by standards track document(s) and
   not in this document.

   Section 3 elaborates a set of general needs for energy management.
   Requirements for an energy management standard are specified in
   Sections 4 to 8.

   Sections 4 to 6 contain conventional requirements specifying
   information on powered entities and control functions.

   Sections 7 and 8 contain requirements specific to energy management.
   Due to the nature of power supply, some monitoring and control
   functions are not conducted by interacting with the powered entity of
   interest, but with other entities, for example, entities upstream in
   a power distribution tree.

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


1.1.  Conventional requirements for energy management

   The specification of requirements for an energy management standard
   starts with Section 4 addressing the identification of powered
   entities and the granularity of reporting of energy-related
   information.  A standard must support unique identification of
   powered entities, reporting per entire powered device, and reporting
   energy-related information on individual components of a device or
   subtended devices.  This is why this draft uses the more general term
   "powered entity" rather than "powered device"; a powered entity may
   be a device or a component of a device.

   Section 5 specifies requirements related to monitoring of powered
   entities.  This includes general (type, context) information and
   specific information on power states, power inlets, power outlets,
   power, energy, and batteries.  Control power state and power supply
   of powered entities is covered by requirements specified in
   Section 6.

1.2.  Specific requirements for energy management

   While the conventional requirements summarized above seem to be all
   that would be needed for energy management, there are significant
   differences between energy management and most well known network
   management functions.  The most significant difference is the need
   for some devices to report on other entities.  There are three major
   reasons for this.
   o  For monitoring a particular powered entity it is not always
      sufficient to communicate with the powered entity only.  When the
      powered entity has no instrumentation for determining power, it
      might still be possible to obtain power values for the entity by
      communication with other entities in its power distribution tree.
      A simple example is retrieving power values from a power meter at
      the power line into the powered entity.  Common examples are a
      Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and a Power over Ethernet (PoE)
      switch.  Both supply power to other entities at sockets or ports,
      respectively, and are often instrumented to measure power per
      socket or port.
   o  Similar considerations apply to controlling power supply of a
      powered entity which often needs direct or indirect communications
      with another entity upstream in the power distribution tree.
      Again, a PDU and a PoE switch are common examples, if they have
      the capability to switch on or off power at their sockets or
      ports, respectively.
   o  Energy management often extends beyond entities with IP network
      interfaces, to non-IP building systems accessed via a gateway.
      Requirements in this document do not cover details of these
      networks, but specify means for opening IP network management



Quittek, et al.        Expires September 14, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


      towards them.
   o  For monitoring powered entities, as their number becomes large, it
      is sometimes not a scalable approach to communicate directly with
      all powered entities directly from a central energy management
      system.

   This specific issue of energy management and a set of further ones
   are covered by requirements specified in Sections 7 and 8.

   The requirements in these sections need a new energy management
   framework that deals with the specific nature of energy management.
   The actual standards documents, such as MIB module specifications,
   address conformance by specifying which feature must, should, or may
   to be implemented by compliant implementations.


2.  Terminology

   Terminology to be used by the eman WG is currently discussed in
   [I-D.parello-eman-definitions].  After final definitions of terms
   have been agreed, those definitions will be listed here.


3.  General Considerations Related to Energy Management

   The basic objective of energy management is operating sets of devices
   with minimal energy, while maintaining a certain level of service.
   Use cases for energy management can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-eman-applicability-statement].

3.1.  Power states

   Powered entities can be set to an operational state that results in
   the lowest energy consumption level that still meets the service
   level performance objectives.  In principle, there are four basic
   types of power states for a powered entity or for a whole system:
   o  full power state
   o  reduced power states (e.g. lower clock rate for processor, lower
      data rate on a link, etc.)
   o  sleep state (not functional, but immediately available)
   o  off state (may require significant time to become operational)
   In specific devices, the number of power states and their properties
   varies considerably.  Simple powered entities may just have only the
   extreme states, full power and off state.  Many devices have three
   basic power states: on, off, and sleep.  However, more finely grained
   power states can be implemented with many levels of each power
   states.

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


3.2.  Saving energy versus maintaining service level agreements

   While the general objective of energy management is quite clear, the
   way to attain that goal is often difficult.  In many cases there is
   no way of reducing power consumption without the consequence of a
   potential performance, service, or capacity degradation.  Then a
   trade-off needs to be dealt with between service level objectives and
   energy minimization.  In other cases a reduction of energy
   consumption can easily be achieved while still maintaining sufficient
   service level performance, for example, by switching powered entities
   to lower power states when higher performance is not needed.

3.3.  Local versus network-wide energy management

   Many energy saving functions are executed locally by a powered
   entity; it monitors its usage and dynamically adapts its energy
   consumption according to the required performance.  It may, for
   example, switch to a sleep state when it is not in use or out of
   scheduled business hours.  An energy management system may observe an
   entity's power state and configure its power saving policies.

   Energy savings can also be achieved with policies implemented by a
   network management system that controls power states of managed
   entities.  Information about the energy consumption of powered
   entities in different power states may be required to set policy.
   Often this information is acquired best through monitoring.

   Both methods, network-wide and local energy management, have
   advantages and disadvantages and often it is desirable to combine
   them.  Central management is often favorable for setting power states
   of a large number of entities at the same time, for example, at the
   beginning and end of business hours in a building.  Local management
   is often preferable for power saving measures based on local
   observations, such as high or low load of an entity.

3.4.  Energy monitoring versus energy saving

   Monitoring energy consumption and power states alone does not reduce
   the energy consumption of a powered entity.  In fact, it may increase
   the power consumption slightly due to monitoring instrumentation that
   consumes energy.  Reporting measured quantities over the network may
   also increase energy use, though the acquired information may be an
   essential input to control loops that save energy.

   Monitoring power states and energy consumption can also be required
   for other purposes including:

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


   o  investigating energy saving potential
   o  evaluating the effectiveness of energy saving policies and
      measures
   o  deriving, implementing, and testing power management strategies
   o  accounting for the total power consumption of a powered entity, a
      network, or a service
   o  predicting a powered entity's reliability based on power usage
   o  choosing time of next maintenance cycle for a powered entity

3.5.  Overview of energy management requirements

   The following basic management functions are required:
   o  monitoring power states
   o  monitoring power (energy consumption rate)
   o  monitoring (accumulated) energy consumption
   o  monitoring power properties
   o  setting power states
   o  setting and enforcing power saving policies

   Power control is complementary to other energy savings measures such
   as low power electronics, energy saving protocols , energy-efficient
   device design (for example, low-power modes for components), and
   energy-efficient network architectures.  Measurement of energy
   consumption can provide useful data for developing these
   technologies.


4.  Identification of Powered Entities

   Powered entities must be uniquely identified.  This includes entities
   that are components of managed devices and in case that one powered
   entity reports information on another one, see Section 7.  For
   powered entities that control other powered entities it is important
   to identify the powered entities they control, see Section 8.

   An entity may be an entire device or a component of it.  Examples of
   components of interest are a hard drive, a battery, or a line card.
   It may be required to be able to control individual components to
   save energy.  For example, server blades can be switched off when the
   overall load is low or line cards at switches may be powered down at
   night.

   Identifiers for devices and components are already defined in
   standard MIB modules, such as the LLDP MIB module [IEEE-802.1AB] and
   the LLDP-MED MIB module [ANSI-TIA-1057] for devices and the Entity
   MIB module [RFC4133] and the Power Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] for
   components of devices.  Energy management needs means to link energy-
   related information to such identifiers.

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


   Instrumentation for measuring energy consumption of a device is
   typically more expensive than instrumentation for retrieving its
   power state.  Many devices may provide power state information for
   all individual components separately, while reporting the energy
   consumption only for the entire device.

4.1.  Identifying powered entities

   The standard must provide means for uniquely identifying powered
   entities.  Uniqueness must be preserved in a domain that is large
   enough to avoid collisions of identities at potential receivers of
   monitored information.

4.2.  Identifying components of powered devices

   The standard must provide means for identifying not just entire
   devices as powered entities, but also individual components.

4.3.  Persistence of identifiers

   The standard must provide means for indicating whether identifiers of
   powered entities are persistent across a re-start of the powered
   entity.

4.4.  Using entity identifiers of other MIB modules

   The standard must provide means for re-using entity identifiers from
   other standards including at least the following:
   o  the entPhysicalIndex in the Entity MIB module [RFC4133]
   o  the LldpPortNumber in the LLDP MIB module [IEEE-802.1AB] and in
      the LLDP-MED MIB module [ANSI-TIA-1057]
   o  the pethPsePortIndex and the pethPsePortGroupIndex in the Power
      Ethernet MIB [RFC3621]
   Generic means for re-using other entity identifiers must be provided.


5.  Information on Powered Entities

   This section describes information on powered entities for which the
   standard must provide means for retrieving and reporting.

   Required information can be structured into six groups.  Section 5.1
   specifies requirements for general information on powered entities,
   such as type of powered entity or context information.  Section 5.4
   covers requirements related to entities' power states.  Requirements
   for information on power inlets and power outlets of powered entities
   are specified in Section 5.2.  Monitoring of power and energy is
   covered by Sections 5.3 and 5.5, respectively.  Section 5.6 specifies

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


   requirements for monitoring batteries.  Finally, the reporting of
   time series of values is covered by Section 5.7.

5.1.  General information on Powered Entities

   For energy management it may be required to understand the role and
   context of a powered entity.  An energy management system may
   aggregate energy consumption according to a defined grouping of
   entities.  When controlling and setting power states it may be
   helpful to understand the grouping of the entity and role of a
   powered entity in a network, for example, it may be important to
   exclude some vital network devices from being switched to lower power
   or even from being switched off.

5.1.1.  Type of powered entity

   The standard must provide means to configure, retrieve and report a
   textual name or a description of a powered entity.

5.1.2.  Context information on powered entities

   The standard must provide means for retrieving and reporting context
   information on powered entities, for example, tags associated with a
   powered entity that indicate the powered entity's role or importance.

5.1.3.  Power priority

   The standard must provide means for retrieving and reporting power
   priorities of powered entities.  Power priorities indicate an order
   in which power states of powered entities are changed, for example,
   to lower power states for saving power.

5.1.4.  Grouping of powered entities

   The standard must provide means for grouping powered entities, for
   example, into energy monitoring domains, energy control domains,
   power supply domains, groups of powered entities of the same type,
   etc.

5.2.  Power interfaces

   A power interface is either an inlet or an outlet.  A few switch
   between these two but most never change.

   Powered entities have power inlets at which they are supplied with
   electric power.  Most powered entities have a single power inlet,
   while some have multiple inlets.  Different power inlets on a device
   are often connected to separate power distribution trees.  For energy

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


   monitoring, it is useful to retrieve information on the number of
   inlets of a powered entity, the availability of power at inlets and
   which of them are actually in use.

   Powered entities can have one or more power outlets for supplying
   other powered entities with electric power.

   For identifying and potentially controlling the source of power
   received at an inlet, it may be required to identify the power outlet
   of another powered entity at which the received power is provided.
   Analogously, for each outlet it is of interest to identify the power
   inlets that receive the power provided at a certain outlet.  Such
   information is also required for constructing the wiring topology of
   electrical power distribution to powered entities.

   Static properties of each power interface are required information
   for energy management.  Static properties include the kind of
   electric current (AC or DC), the nominal voltage, the nominal AC
   frequency, and the number of AC phases.

5.2.1.  Lists of power interfaces

   The standard must provide means for monitoring the list of power
   interfaces.

5.2.2.  Corresponding power outlet

   The standard must provide means for identifying the power outlet that
   provides the power received at a power inlet.

5.2.3.  Corresponding power inlets

   The standard must provide means for identifying the list of power
   inlets that receive the power provided at a power outlet.

5.2.4.  Availability of power

   The standard must provide means for monitoring the availability of
   power at each power interface.  This indicates whether at a power
   interfaces power supply is switched on or off.

5.2.5.  Use of power

   The standard must provide means for monitoring for each power
   interfaces if it is in actual use.  For inlets this means that the
   powered entity actually receives power at the inlet.  For outlets
   this means that power is actually provided from it to one or more
   powered entities.

5.2.6.  Type of current

   The standard must provide means for reporting the type of current (AC
   or DC) for each power interface.

5.2.7.  Nominal voltage

   The standard must provide means for reporting the nominal voltage for
   each power interface.

5.2.8.  Nominal AC frequency

   The standard must provide means for reporting the nominal AC
   frequency for each power interface.

5.2.9.  Number of AC phases

   The standard must provide means for reporting the number of AC phases
   for each power interface.

5.3.  Power

   Power is measured as an instantaneous value or as the average over a
   time interval.

   Obtaining highly accurate values for power and energy may be costly
   if it requires dedicated metering hardware.  Powered entities without
   the ability to measure their power and energy consumption with high
   accuracy may just report estimated values, for example based on load
   monitoring or even just the entity type.

   Depending on how power and energy consumption values are obtained,
   the confidence in the reported value and its accuracy will vary.
   Powered entities reporting such values should qualify the confidence
   in the reported values and quantify the accuracy of measurements.
   For reporting accuracy, the accuracy classes specified in IEC
   62053-21 [IEC.62053-21] and IEC 62053-22 [IEC.62053-22] should be
   considered.

   Further properties of the supplied power are also of interest.  For
   AC power supply, power attributes beyond the real power to be
   reported include the apparent power, the reactive power, and the
   phase angle of the current or the power factor.  For both AC and DC
   power the power characteristics are also subject of monitoring.
   Power parameters include the actual voltage, the actual frequency,
   the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of voltage and current, the
   impedance of an AC phase or of the DC supply.  Power monitoring
   should be in line with existing standards, such as [IEC.61850-7-4].

   For some network management tasks it is desirable to receive
   notifications from powered entities when their power value exceeds or
   falls below given thresholds.

5.3.1.  Real power

   The standard must provide means for reporting the real power for each
   power interface, including the direction of power flow.

5.3.2.  Power measurement interval

   The standard must provide means for reporting the corresponding time
   or time interval for which a power value is reported.  The power
   value can be measured at the corresponding time or averaged over the
   corresponding time interval.

5.3.3.  Power measurement method

   The standard must provide means to indicating the method how these
   values have been obtained.  Based on how the measurement was
   obtained, it is possible to associate a certain degree of confidence
   on the reported power value.  For example, there are methods of
   measurement such as direct power measurement, or by estimation based
   on performance values, or hard coding average power values for a
   powered entity.

5.3.4.  Accuracy of power and energy values

   The standard must provide means for reporting the accuracy of
   reported power and energy values.

5.3.5.  Actual voltage and current

   The standard must provide means for reporting the actual voltage and
   actual current for each power interface.  In case of AC power supply,
   means must be provided for reporting the actual voltage and actual
   current per phase.

5.3.6.  High/low power notifications

   The standard must provide means for creating notifications if power
   values of a powered entity rise above or fall below given thresholds.

5.3.7.  Complex power

   The standard must provide means for reporting the complex power for
   each power interface.  Besides the real power, at least two out of
   the following three quantities need to be reported: apparent power,



Quittek, et al.        Expires September 14, 2012              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


   reactive power, phase angle.  The phase angle can be substituted by
   the power factor.  In case of AC power supply, means must be provided
   for reporting the complex power per phase.

5.3.8.  Actual AC frequency

   The standard must provide means for reporting the actual AC frequency
   for each power interface.

5.3.9.  Total harmonic distortion

   The standard must provide means for reporting the Total Harmonic
   Distortion (THD) of voltage and current for each power interface.  In
   case of AC power supply, means must be provided for reporting the THD
   per phase.

5.3.10.  Power supply impedance

   The standard must provide means for reporting the impedance of power
   supply for each power interface.  In case of AC power supply, means
   must be provided for reporting the impedance per phase.

5.4.  Power state

   Many powered entities have a limited number of discrete power states.

   There is a need to report the actual power state of a powered entity,
   and means for retrieving the list of all supported power states.

   Different standards bodies have already defined sets of power states
   for some powered entities, and others are creating new power state
   sets.  In this context, it is desirable that the standard support
   many of these power state standards.  In order to support multiple
   management systems possibly using different power state sets, while
   simultaneously interfacing with a particular powered entity, the
   energy management standard must provide means for supporting multiple
   power state sets used simultaneously at a powered entity.

   Power states have parameters that describe its properties.  It is
   required to have standardized means for reporting some key
   properties, such as average power and maximum power of a powered
   entity in a certain state.

   There also is a need to report statistics on power states including
   the time spent and the energy consumed in a power state.

5.4.1.  Actual power state

   The standard must provide means for reporting the actual power state
   of a powered entity.

5.4.2.  List of supported power states

   The standard must provide means for retrieving the list of all
   potential power states of a powered entity.

5.4.3.  Multiple power state sets

   The standard must provide means for supporting multiple power state
   sets simultaneously at a powered entity.

5.4.4.  List of supported power state sets

   The standard must provide means for retrieving the list of all power
   state sets supported by a powered entity.

5.4.5.  List of supported power states within a set

   The standard must provide means for retrieving the list of all
   potential power states of a powered entity for each supported power
   state set.

5.4.6.  Maximum and average power per power state

   The standard must provide means for retrieving the maximum power and
   the average power for each supported power state.  These values may
   be static.

5.4.7.  Power state statistics

   The standard must provide means for monitoring statistics per power
   state including the total time spent in a power state, the number of
   times each state was entered and the last time each state was
   entered.  More power state statistics are addressed by requirement
   5.5.3.

5.4.8.  Power state changes

   The standard must provide means for generating a notification when
   the actual power state of a powered entity changes.

5.5.  Energy

   Monitoring of electrical energy received or provided by a powered
   entity is a core function of energy management.  Since energy is an
   accumulated quantity, it is always reported for a certain interval of
   time.  This can be, for example, the time from the last restart of
   the powered entity to the reporting time, the time from another past
   event to the reporting time, the last given amount of time before the
   reporting time, or a certain interval specified by two time stamps in
   the past.

   It is useful for powered entities to record their energy consumption
   per power state and report these quantities.

5.5.1.  Energy

   The standard must provide means for reporting the energy consumed or
   produced of a powered entity.  The standard must also provide the
   means to report the energy passing through each power interface.
   Reports should clearly specify the time interval for the energy
   measurement.

5.5.2.  Time intervals

   The standard must provide means for reporting the consumed energy of
   a powered entity for specified time intervals.
   o  Reports must be supported for the time interval starting at the
      last restart of the powered entity and ending at a certain point
      in time, such as the time when a report was delivered.
   o  Reports must be supported for a sequence of consecutive non-
      overlapping time intervals of fixed size (periodic reports).
   o  Reports must be supported for a sequence of consecutive
      overlapping time intervals of fixed size (periodic reports).
   o  Reports must be supported for an interval of given length ending
      at a certain point in time, such as the time when a report was
      delivered (sliding window)

5.5.3.  Energy per power state

   The standard must provide means for reporting the consumed energy
   individually for each power state.  This extends the requirement
   5.4.7 on power state statistics.

5.6.  Battery state

   Many powered entities contain batteries that supply them with power
   when disconnected from electrical power distribution grids.  The
   status of these batteries is typically controlled by automatic



Quittek, et al.        Expires September 14, 2012              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


   functions that act locally on the powered entity and manually by
   users of the powered entity.  There is a need to monitor the battery
   status of these entities by network management systems.

   Devices containing batteries can be modeled in two ways.  The entire
   device can be modeled as a single powered entity on which energy-
   related information is reported or the battery can be modeled as an
   individual powered entity for which energy-related information is
   monitored individually according to requirements in Sections 5.1 to
   5.5.

   Further information on batteries is of interest for energy
   management, such as the current charge of the battery, the number of
   completed charging cycles, the charging state of the battery, and
   further static and dynamic battery properties.  It is desirable to
   receive notifications if the charge of a battery becomes very low or
   if a battery needs to be replaced.

5.6.1.  Battery charge

   The standard must provide means for reporting the current charge of a
   battery.

5.6.2.  Battery charging state

   The standard must provide means for reporting the charging state
   (charging, discharging, etc.) of a battery.

5.6.3.  Battery charging cycles

   The standard must provide means for reporting the number of completed
   charging cycles of a battery.

5.6.4.  Actual battery capacity

   The standard must provide means for reporting the actual capacity of
   a battery.

5.6.5.  Static battery properties

   The standard must provide means for reporting static properties of a
   battery, including the nominal capacity, the number of cells, the
   nominal voltage, and the battery technology.

5.6.6.  Low battery charge notification

   The standard must provide means for generating a notification when
   the charge of a battery decreases below a given threshold.



Quittek, et al.        Expires September 14, 2012              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


5.6.7.  Battery replacement notification

   The standard must provide means for generating a notification when
   the number of charging cycles of battery exceeds a given threshold.

5.6.8.  Multiple batteries

   The standard must provide means for meeting requirements 5.6.1 to
   5.6.7 for each individual battery contained in a single powered
   entity.

5.7.  Time series of measured values

   For some network management tasks, it is required to obtain time
   series of measured values, such as power, energy, battery charge,
   etc.

   In general these could be obtained in many different ways.  It should
   be avoided that such time series can only be obtained through regular
   polling by the energy management system.  Means should be provided to
   either push such values from the location where they are available to
   the management system or to have them stored locally for a
   sufficiently long period of time such that a management system can
   retrieve full time series.

   While there is a common understanding that support for reporting of
   time series is needed, there is no clear agreement on four issues:
   1.  Which quantities should be reported?
   2.  Which time interval type should be used (total, delta, sliding
       window)?
   3.  Which measurement method should be used (sampled, continuous)?
   4.  Which reporting model should be used (push or pull)?

   The most discussed and probably most needed quantities are power and
   energy.  But a need for others, for example, battery charge can be
   identified as well.

   There are three time interval types under discussion for accumulated
   quantities such as energy.  They can be reported as total values,
   accumulated between the last restart of the measurement and a certain
   timestamp.  Alternatively, they can be reported as delta values
   between two consecutive timestamps.  Another alternative is reporting
   values for sliding windows as specified in [IEC.61850-7-4].

   For non-accumulative quantities, such as power, different measurement
   methods are considered.  Such quantities can be reported using values
   sampled at certain time stamps or alternatively by mean values for
   these quantities averaged between two (consecutive) time stamps or



Quittek, et al.        Expires September 14, 2012              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


   over a sliding window.

   Finally, time series can be reported using different reporting
   models, particularly push-based or pull-based.  Push-based reporting
   can, for example, be realized by reporting power or energy values
   using the IPFIX protocol [RFC5101],[RFC5102].  SNMP [RFC3411] is an
   example for a protocol that can be used for realizing pull-based
   reporting of time series.

   All these issues are not clear at the time this document is written.
   If practical experiences with the energy management standard to be
   defined will be available, they may help reducing the large number of
   choices and identifying and specifying commonly shared requirements
   for reporting time series of energy-related quantities in a future
   revision of this document.


6.  Control of Powered Entities

   Many powered entities control their power state locally.  Other
   powered entities without that capability need interfaces for an
   energy management system to control their power states.  Even for
   self-managed powered entities such interfaces may be required for
   configuring local policy parameters and for overruling local policy
   decisions by global ones.

   Power supply is typically not self-managed by powered entities.  And
   controlling power supply is typically not conducted as interaction
   between energy management system and the powered entity itself.  It
   is rather an interaction between the management system and an entity
   providing power at its power outlets.  Similar to power state
   control, power supply control may be policy driven.  Note that
   shutting down the power supply abruptly may have severe consequences
   for the powered entity.

6.1.  Controlling power states

   The standard must provide means for setting power states of powered
   entities.

6.2.  Controlling power supply

   The standard must provide means for switching power supply off or
   turning power supply on at power outlets providing power to one or
   more powered entity.

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


7.  Reporting on other Powered Entities

   As discussed in Section 5, not all energy-related information may be
   available at the concerned powered entity.  Such information may be
   provided by other powered entities.  This section covers reporting of
   information only.  See Section 8 for requirements on controlling
   other powered entities.

   There are cases where a power supply unit switches power for several
   powered entities by turning power on or off at a single power outlet
   or where a power meter measures the accumulated power of several
   powered entities at a single power line.  Consequently, it should be
   possible to report that a monitored value does not relate to just a
   single powered entity, but is an accumulated value for a set of
   powered entities.  All of these powered entities belonging to that
   set need to be identified.

   If a powered entity has information about where energy-related
   information on itself can be retrieved, then it would be useful to
   communicate this information.  This applies even if the information
   only provides accumulated quantities for several powered entities.

7.1.  Reports on other powered entities

   The standard must provide means for a powered entity to report
   information on another powered entity.

7.2.  Identity of other powered entities on which is reported

   For entities that report on one or more other entities, the standard
   must provide means for reporting the identity of other powered
   entities on which information is reported.

7.3.  Reporting quantities accumulated over multiple powered entities

   The standard must provide means for reporting the list of all powered
   entities from which contributions are included in an accumulated
   value.

7.4.  List of all powered entities on which is reported

   For entities that report on one or more other entities, the standard
   must provide means for reporting the complete list of all those
   powered entities on which energy-related information can be reported.

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


7.5.  Content of reports on other powered entities

   For entities that report on one or more other entities, the standard
   must provide means for indicating which energy-related information
   can be reported for which of those powered entities.

7.6.  Indicating source of remote information

   For an entity that has one or more other entities reporting on its
   behalf, the standard must provide means for the entity to to indicate
   which information is available at which other entity.

7.7.  Indicating content of remote information

   For an entity that has one or more other entities reporting on its
   behalf, the standard must provide means for indicating the content
   that other designated entities can report on it.


8.  Controlling Other Powered Entities

   This section specifies requirements for controlling power states and
   power supply of powered entities by communicating with other powered
   entities that have means for controlling power state or power supply
   of others.

8.1.  Controlling power states of other Powered Entities

   Some powered entities have control of power states of other powered
   entities.  For example a gateway to a building system may have means
   to control the power state of powered entities in the building that
   do not have an IP interface.  For this scenario and other similar
   cases means are needed to make this control accessible to the energy
   management system.

   In addition to this, it is required that a powered entity that has
   its state controlled by other powered entities has means to report
   the list of these other powered entities.

8.1.1.  Control of power states of other Powered Entities

   The standard must provide means for an energy management system to
   send power state control commands to a powered entity that concern
   the power states of other powered entities than the one the command
   was sent to.

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


8.1.2.  Identity of other power state controlled entities

   The standard must provide means for reporting the identities of the
   powered entities for which reporting powered entity has means to
   control their power states.

8.1.3.  List of all power state controlled entities

   The standard must provide means for a powered entity to report the
   list of all powered entities for which it can control the power
   state.

8.1.4.  List of all power state controllers

   The standard must provide means for a powered entity that receives
   commands controlling its power state from other powered entities to
   report the list of all those entities.

8.2.  Controlling power supply

   Some powered entities may have control of the power supply of other
   powered entities, for example, because the other powered entity is
   supplied via a power outlet of the powered entity.  For this and
   similar cases means are needed to make this control accessible to the
   energy management system.  This need is already addressed by
   requirement 6.2.

   In addition, it is required that a powered entity that has its supply
   controlled by other powered entities has means to report the list of
   these other powered entities.  This need is already addressed by
   requirements 5.2.2 and 5.2.3.


9.  Security Considerations

   Controlling power state and power supply of powered entities are
   highly sensitive actions since they can significantly affect the
   operation of directly and indirectly affected devices.  Therefore all
   control actions addressed in 6 and 8 must be sufficiently protected
   through authentication, authorization, and integrity protection
   mechanisms.

   Monitoring energy-related quantities of a powered entity addressed in
   Sections 5 - 8 can be used to derive more information than just the
   consumed power, so monitored data requires privacy protection.
   Monitored data may be used as input to control, accounting, and other
   actions, so integrity of transmitted information and authentication
   of the origin may be needed.

9.1.  Secure energy management

   The standard must provide privacy, integrity, and authentication
   mechanisms for all actions addressed in Sections 5 - 8.  The security
   mechanisms must address all threats listed in Section 1.4 of
   [RFC3411].


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

12.  Open issues

12.1.  Standards for DC power characteristics?

   Is there a standard on DC power characteristics?  Would they be
   needed for EMAN?

12.2.  Directional metering of Power and Energy

   Still not covered consistently.

12.3.  Drop requirements for Impedance and THD?

   YCM === I am not certain we need this requirement.  I understand the
   point a requirement need not be implemented.  My contention impedance
   and THD are not necessary for EMAN.

12.4.  Rime intervals for energy measurements

   After the requirements on time series have been dropped, requirement
   5.5.2 on time intervals for energy measurements may have to be
   revised.

12.5.  Reporting on other devices

   This needs to be considered whether it is devices or interfaces or
   entities that are to be reported on.

Appendix A.  Existing Standards

   This section analyzes existing standards for energy consumption and
   power state monitoring.  It shows that there are already several
   standards that cover only some part of the requirements listed above,
   but even all together they do not cover all of the requirements for
   energy management.

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


A.1.  Existing IETF Standards

   There are already RFCs available that address a subset of the
   requirements.

A.1.1.  ENTITY MIB

   The ENTITY-MIB module defined in [RFC4133] was designed to model
   physical and logical entities of a managed system.  A physical entity
   is an identifiable physical component.  A logical entity can use one
   or more physical entities.  From an energy monitoring perspective of
   a managed system, the ENTITY-MIB modeling framework can be reused and
   whenever RFC 4133 [RFC4133] has been implemented.  The
   entPhysicalIndex from entPhysicalTable can be used to identify an
   entity/component.  However, there are use cases of energy monitoring,
   where the application of the ENTITY-MIB does not seem readily
   apparent and some of those entities could be beyond the original
   scope and intent of the ENTITY-MIB.

   Consider the case of remote devices attached to the network, and the
   network device could collect the energy measurement and report on
   behalf of such attached devices.  Some of the remote devices such as
   PoE phones attached to a switch port have been considered in the
   Power-over-Ethernet MIB module [RFC3621].  However, there are many
   other devices such as a computer, which draw power from a wall outlet
   or building HVAC devices which seem to be beyond the original scope
   of the ENTITY-MIB.

   Yet another example, is smart-PDUs, which can report the energy
   consumption of the device attached to the power outlet of the PDU.
   In some cases, the device can be attached to multiple to power
   outlets.  Thus, the energy measured at multiple outlets need to be
   aggregated to determine the consumption of a single device.  From
   mapping perspective, between the PDU outlets and the device this is a
   many-to-one mapping.  It is not clear if such a many-to-one mapping
   is feasible within the ENTITY-MIB framework.

A.1.2.  ENTITY STATE MIB

   RFC 4268 [RFC4268] defines the ENTITY STATE MIB module.
   Implementations of this module provide information on entities
   including the standby status (hotStandby, coldStandby,
   providingService), the operational status (disabled, enabled,
   testing), the alarm status (underRepair, critical, major, minor,
   warning), and the usage status (idle, active, busy).  This
   information is already useful as input for policy decisions and for
   other network management tasks.  However, the number of states would
   cover only a small subset of the requirements for power state



Quittek, et al.        Expires September 14, 2012              [Page 26]

Internet-Draft     Requirements for Energy Management         March 2012


   monitoring and it does not provide means for energy consumption
   monitoring.  For associating the information conveyed by the ENTITY
   STATE MIB to specific components of a device, the ENTITY STATE MIB
   module makes use of the means provided by the ENTITY MIB module
   [RFC4133].  Particularly, it uses the entPhysicalIndex for
   identifying entities.

   The standby status provided by the ENTITY STATE MIB module is related
   to power states required for energy management, but the number of
   states is too restricted for meeting all energy management
   requirements.  For energy management several more power states are
   required, such as different sleep and operational states as defined
   by the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) [ACPI.R30b]
   or the DMTF Power State Management Profile [DMTF.DSP1027].

A.1.3.  ENTITY SENSOR MIB

   RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module.
   Implementations of this module offer a generic way to provide data
   collected by a sensor.  A sensor could be an energy consumption meter
   delivering measured values in Watt.  This could be used for reporting
   current power of an entity and its components.  Furthermore, the
   ENTITY SENSOR MIB can be used to retrieve the accuracy of the used
   power meter.

   Similar to the ENTITY STATE MIB module, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module
   makes use of the means provided by the ENTITY MIB module [RFC4133]
   for relating provided information to components of a device.

   However, there is no unit available for reporting energy quantities,
   such as, for example, watt seconds or kilowatt hours, and the ENTITY
   SENSOR MIB module does not support reporting accuracy of measurements
   according to the IEC / ANSI accuracy classes, which are commonly in
   use for electric power and energy measurements.  The ENTITY SENSOR
   MIB modules only provides a coarse-grained method for indicating
   accuracy by stating the number of correct digits of fixed point
   values.

A.1.4.  UPS MIB

   RFC 1628 [RFC1628] defines the UPS MIB module.  Implementations of
   this module provide information on the current real power of entities
   attached to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) device.  This
   application would require identifying which entity is attached to
   which port of the UPS device.

   UPS MIB provides information on the state of the UPS network.  The
   MIB module contains several variables that are used to identify the



Quittek, et al.        Expires September 14, 2012              [Page 27]

   UPS entity (name, model,..), the battery state, to characterize the
   input load to the UPS, to characterize the output from the UPS, to
   indicate the various alarm events.  The measurements of power in UPS
   MIB are in Volts, Amperes and Watts.  The units of power measurement
   are RMS volts, RMS Amperes and are not based on Entity-Sensor MIB
   [RFC3433].

A.1.5.  POWER ETHERNET MIB

   Similar to the UPS MIB, implementations of the POWER ETHERNET MIB
   module defined in RFC3621 [RFC3621] provide information on the
   current energy consumption of the entities that receive Power over
   Ethernet (PoE).  This information can be retrieved at the power
   sourcing equipment.  Analogous to the UPS MIB, it is required to
   identify which entities are attached to which port of the power
   sourcing equipment.

   The POWER ETHERNET MIB does not report power and energy consumption
   on a per port basis, but can report aggregated values for groups of
   ports.  It does not use objects of the ENTITY MIB module for
   identifying entities, although this module existed already when the
   POWER ETHERNET MIB modules was standardized.

A.1.6.  LLDP MED MIB

   The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) defined in IEEE 802.1ab is a
   data link layer protocol used by network devices for advertising of
   their identities, capabilities, and interconnections on a LAN
   network.  The Media Endpoint Discovery (MED) (ANSI-TIA-1057) is an
   enhancement of LLDP known as LLDP-MED.  The LLDP-MED enhancements
   specifically address voice applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic
   areas: capabilities discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery,
   network policy discovery, location identification discovery,
   inventory discovery, and power discovery.

A.2.  Existing standards of other bodies

A.2.1.  DMTF

   The DMTF has defined a power state management profile [DMTF.DSP1027]
   that is targeted at computer systems.  It is based on the DMTF's
   Common Information Model (CIM) and it is rather an entity profile
   than an actual energy consumption monitoring standard.

   The power state management profile is used to describe and to manage
   the power state of computer systems.  This includes e.g. means to
   change the power state of an entity (e.g. to shutdown the entity)
   which is an aspect of but not sufficient for active energy

   management.

A.2.2.  OVDA

   ODVA is an association consisting of members from industrial
   automation companies.  ODVA supports standardization of network
   technologies based on the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP).  Within
   ODVA, there is a special interest group focused on energy and
   standardization and inter-operability of energy aware entities.

A.2.3.  IEEE-ISTO Printer WG

   The charter of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group is for open
   standards that define printer related protocols, that printer
   manufacturers and related software vendors shall benefit from the
   interoperability provided by conformance to these standards.  One
   particular aspect the Printer WG is focused on is power monitoring
   and management of network printers and imaging systems PWG Power
   Management Model for Imaging Systems [IEEE-ISTO].  Clearly, these
   devices are within the scope of energy management since these devices
   consume power and are attached to the network.  In addition, there is
   ample scope of power management since printers and imaging systems
   are not used that often.  IEEE-ISTO Printer working group has defined
   MIB modules for monitoring the power consumption and power state
   series that can be useful for power management of printers.  The
   energy management framework should also take into account the
   standards defined in the Printer working group.  In terms of other
   standards, IETF Printer MIB RFC3805 [RFC3805] has been standardized,
   however, this MIB module does not address power management of
   printers.
