INTERNET DRAFT  TCAM power reduction methods in Routers    November 2012


1  Introduction

   This idea / draft entails enabling power and performance management
   in Routers (multi-chassis and single chassis) with respect to TCAM /
   SRAM usage on intelligent router line cards that implement Virtual
   Aggregation.

   Distributed line cards in a routers have intelligence to forward
   packet without interference from the central control plane, once
   their TCAMs and associated SRAMs are populated. Since memory and TCAM
   are the most power hungry components in these line cards, we should
   effectively manage the line card power usage by optimally using their
   SRAM memory and TCAM banks. 

   When a packet enters a distributed line card, the packet switching   
   logic extracts information from  the header. It then  looks up the 
   entry in the appropriate TCAM (CAM in L2  switches or both in Multi-
   layer switches), and then passes the packet to the outgoing line
   card. The packet is then placed onto the outgoing port. The TCAM
   banks used in the line cards typically carry the entire forwarding
   table as tabulated by the central control processor card/cards (when
   in plurality used for redundancy). All line cards do not need the
   entire forwarding table as each line card may serve a set of sources
   and destinations. This is true especially in smaller networks but may
   also apply to routers in the internet, especially  ASBRs and POP
   border routers facing the customers of the ISP. Switching on the 
   entire set of TCAMs (in the worst case) and downloading the entire
   forwarding table atop each of the line cards in the chassis leads to 
   a sub-optimal way of  switching packets

   Current status quo on this (apart from VPN route localization) is a
   proof that as far as internet destinations go, all line cards on the 
   backbone routers  or even within a small campus or a medium sized
   ISP, carry the entire forwarding table built by the routing table
   manager on these routers. In order to obviate the necessity of
   carrying routes which are unused (by this term. we mean those that
   are unreferenced  for making forwarding decisions) and to reduce TCAM
   space (applicable  to switching as well which involves CAMs), we
   suggest a solution where a couple of Linecards are considered to be
   Designated and others are called Backup. 

   Designated Linecards are filled with all the entries from the control
    plane. The rest of the Linecards are provided with entries leftover
   from aging other entries which were not used over a period of time.
   An entry may not be available in these Linecards after they have been
   aged out (because of not being referenced and/or modified), these
   non- DLC linecards (as they are called), refer to the DLC/BDLC
   linecards for the first packet of a flow and retrieve the prefixes

   associated with the hit on the DLC/BDLC. They populate these
   retrieved entries in the TCAM. Periodically on the non-DLC linecards
   a Route aggregation similar to the S-VA or the simple Virtual
   Aggregate with exception entries is generated  to further reduce the
   TCAM occupation. The TCAM banks which are not occupied as a result of
   this scheme may be switched off. This inturn can switch off their
   associated SRAM banks as well which contain the rewrite information.
   The paper also opens up the idea to simulations which help strengthen
   the argument for this scheme.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

2.  Methodology

   Distributed line cards in a routers have intelligence to forward
   packet without interference from the central control plane, once
   their TCAMs and associated SRAMs are populated.  

   Since memory and TCAM are  the most power hungry components  in these
   line cards, we should effectively manage the line card power usage by
   optimally using their SRAM memory and TCAM banks.

   When a  packet enters a distributedline card,  the packet switching
   logic extracts information from the header. It then  looks up the
   entry in the appropriate TCAM (CAM in L2 switches or both in Multi-
   layer switches), and then passes the packet to the outgoing line
   card. It is then placed onto the outgoing port. The TCAM banks used
   in the line cards typically carry the entire forwarding table as

   carrying routes which are unused (by this term. we mean those that
   are unreferenced for making forwarding decisions) and to reduce  TCAM
   space (applicable to switching as well which involves CAMs), we
   suggest the following solution:

   a)	At initialization time the entire forwarding table that is
   constructed in the control processor is downloaded to all line cards.
   This is the current implementation in most routers today.

   b)	Begin a clock algorithm on these routes using a referenced bit and
   modified bit that is appended to each TCAM entry in the line card.

   	a. When a TCAM entry is accessed for  forwarding decision in the
   router on a specific line card, the referenced bit associated with
   that entry is set. 

   	b. When a TCAM entry is modified as a result of a routing entry the
   modified bit is set.

   	c. A timer called the ReferenceTimer  is started  with a suitable
   interval.

   	d. When the ReferenceTimer clock ticks down to 0, the TCAM entries
   in the line card is scanned and those that have the following values
   are not disturbed.

      		1.	Referenced bit = 1, Modified bit = 1 
   		2.	Referenced bit = 0, Modified bit = 1

      	e. A timer called ModifiedDecayTimer  is also started  using a
   suitable time interval.

   	f. The ModifiedDecayTimer is a single global timer which is started
   whenever a route change that modifies the nexthop to a set of route
   entries is downloaded to  the line card (which is the status quo as
   of now). Each line card has its own respective ModifiedDecayTimer.

   	g. On expiry of the ModifiedDecayTimer the TCAM entries with
   modified bit = 1 are cleared to 0. 

           h. Similarly each TCAM entry has a 32 bit counter that counts
   down to 0, which is in effect a ReferencedDecayTimer. A suitable
   value may be appended to this counter at the time of initialization
   and when the TCAM entry  is referenced for forwarding. This counter
   is active only for the active banks of TCAM

           A suitable alternative with or without the counter would be
   an LRU policy that removes and adds entries as appropriate.

      i.	When the ReferencedDecayTimer counts down to 0, the referenced
   bit for that TCAM entry is cleared.

      j.	Continuing from (d) the TCAM entries with Modified bit = 0 and
   Referenced bit = 0 are removed from the TCAM when the ReferencedTimer
   expires. Further optimization on the TCAM may be done at regular
   intervals whenever the ReferencedTimer expires. This would involve
   re-arranging the TCAM to optimize on storage. This could be a
   parallel thread in hardware.

   We will consider the initial condition on how these entries get
   populated. If a packet enters a line card on one of its ports and the
   switching logic finds that the TCAM entry is absent  or  has been
   cleared from its entry in the TCAM. We use a mechanism by which such
   a packet is first forwarded to one of the DLC (or designated Line
   cards which may be elected from the set of line cards in the chassis)
   where the entire forwarding table is always stored. There may be a
   Primary DLC and a backup DLC for redundancy purposes. When the packet
   hits the ingress line card which does not  have the required TCAM
   entry for forwarding, it routes the packet within the chassis to the
   DLC. The DLC receives the packet or just the packet header  and does
   the following:

      i) Looks up its full forwarding table, 

      ii) Picks up the result and along with it the TCAM entry or
   entries  which accumulate to all the set of related routes (perhaps
   all the routes with the same suffix) and 

      iii) sends them across to the ingress line card in question. 

   The ingress line card uses the result to forward the packet and
   populates the TCAM with the group  of entries dispatched to it by the
   DLC or the Backup DLC. One could use per-packet loadbalancing within
   the ingress line card to distribute the result  in such a way that
   the load is effectively shared by picking to the DLC and the Backup
   DLC.   Once the set of routes sent back from the DLC is accumulated
   and  loaded into the TCAM, it may be periodically scanned and
   compressed even at a later point in time.

   Now the ingress line card has the required entries. We  assume that 
   the flows that go to the desired  destinations from then on would hit
   the TCAM entries that are populated according to the method discussed
   above.

   Thus, long lived TCP / UDP flows would have TCAM entries populated
   for the duration of their existence in the respective scheme-deployed
   linecards. Smaller timed flows too would have entries populated but

   this could be throttled by doing inspection deeper into the packet
   (for example, to see if it is DNS).

   With respect to  multicast routes, all multicast routing entries and
   their respective unicast companions are  left on the line card and
   are not affected by this scheme. This relates to unicast routing
   alone and TCAM entries that relate to it. It is obvious to see
   because the OIL is dynamic for the multicast routes. Applying this
   technique to multicast would lead to thrashing of entries in the
   TCAM. Additionally if a set  threshold   called ResultQueryThreshold 
   is configured on the DLC slots. If this is exceeded in terms of rate
   of packets coming to DLCs, a periodic full download of the entire
   forwarding table is done to the those  linecards  which deploy this
   scheme. A further purge could be done using the Timers mentioned
   above. It is also possible to think of deploying this scheme
   selectively on a set of line cards. In this method, the rest of the
   line cards can act as TCAM entry route servers. Such an arrangement
   can help in load balancing the packets on the scheme-deployed line
   cards to transfer to each of them in a round robin fashion for DLC
   lookup.

2.1 Using Aggregate routes

   Also periodically on the non-DLC linecards a Route aggregation
   similar to the S-VA or the simple Virtual Aggregate with exception
   entries is generated further to reduce the TCAM occupation. 

2.2 Switching off the TCAM banks which are unused

   The TCAM banks which are not occupied as a result of this scheme may
   be switched off completely along with their associated SRAM banks as
   well which contain the rewrite information. The paper also opens up
   the idea to simulations which help strengthen the argument for this
   scheme.

   Further examples of this will be dealt with in the future versions of

   Further examples of this will be dealt with in the future versions of
   this document.

2.4 Advantages 

   Though it seems to be complex, the TCAM banks unused as a result of
   this scheme save power when they are empty. 

   The switching logic may not use them since they are empty.

   Power consumption of related SRAM banks that map to these TCAM banks
   , which store datum connected to route entries represented in the
   respective TCAM entries are also saved from being refreshed. 

   A finer granularity of TCAM banks w.r.t to their size and the number
   of TCAM entries that occupy these banks can be achieved to derive
   maximum benefit from this scheme.
