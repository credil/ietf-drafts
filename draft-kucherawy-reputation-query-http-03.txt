Internet-Draft    Reputation Queries with HTTP and XML      October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a method to query a reputation data service for
   information about an entity, using the HyperText Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) as the transport mechanism and XML as the payload format.  It
   is part of a series defining the overall reputation query/response
   structure as well as the concept of reputation "vocabularies" for
   particular applications.


2.  Document Series

   This memo represents the media type registration, part of a series of
   documents that define the overall service and introduce the initial
   exemplary applications.  The series is as follows:

   1.  RFCxxxx: A Model for Reputation Interchange

   2.  RFCxxxx+1: A Media Type for Reputation Information

   3.  RFCxxxx+2: Using UDP for Reputation Interchange

   4.  RFCxxxx+3: Using the DNS for Reputation Interchange

   5.  RFCxxxx+4: Using HTTP/XML for Reputation Interchange (this memo)

   6.  RFCxxxx+5: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Identity Reputation

   7.  RFCxxxx+6: A Reputation Vocabulary for Email Property Reputation


3.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

3.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.2.  Other Definitions

   Other terms of importance in this memo are defined in RFCxxxx, the
   base memo in this document series.

Internet-Draft    Reputation Queries with HTTP and XML      October 2011


4.  Description

4.1.  Query

   A reputation query made via [HTTP] encodes the question being asked
   partly in the [URI] and partly within the GET instruction of the
   protocol.

   The components to the question being asked comprise the following:

   o  The subject of the query;

   o  The name of the host, or the IP address, at which the reputation
      service is available;

   o  The name of the reputation application, i.e., the context within
      which the query is being made;

   o  Optionally, name(s) of the specific reputation assertions or
      attributies that are being requested.

   The name of the application MUST be one registered with IANA.  A
   server receiving a query about an unregistered application or one it
   does not explicitly support MUST return a 404 error code.

   The syntax for the URI portion of the query is constructed using a
   template as per [URI-TEMPLATE].  The following variables MUST be
   available during template expansion:

   application:  The name of the application reputation in whose context
      the request is being made.

   scheme:  The transport scheme the client will be using for the query.

   service:  The hostname or IP address being queried.

   Which scheme(s) can be used depends on how the reputation service
   provider offers its services.  Thus, the template could include a
   specific schema as a fixed string in the template, or it might offer
   it as a variable in the template.  If it is a variable, it is up to
   the client and server to negotiate out-of-band which schemes are
   supported for client queries.  Implementers should be aware that the
   template could include a fixed scheme not supported by the client.

   The following variables are OPTIONAL, but might be required by the
   template presented for a specific service:

Internet-Draft    Reputation Queries with HTTP and XML      October 2011


   assertion:  A list of one or more specific assertions of interest to
      the client.  If absent, the server MUST infer that all available
      assertion information is being requested.

   passwd:  The "password" portion of a client credential.

   user:  The "user" portion of a client credential.

   Other required or optional query parameters might be defined by
   documents that register new vocabularies with IANA.

   The template is retrieved by requesting the [WELL-KNOWN-URI]
   "repute_template" from the host providing reputation service using
   HTTP.  If the template cannot be retrieved, the query should be
   aborted and/or retried at a later time.

   For example, given the following template:

   {scheme}://{service}/{application}/{subject}/{assertion}

   A query about the use of the domain "example.org" in the "email-id"
   application context to a service run at "example.com", where that
   application declares a required "subject" parameter, requesting the
   "SENDS-SPAM" reputation assertion using HTTP to conduct the query
   with no specific client authentication information would be formed as
   follows:

   http://example.com/email-id/example.org/sends-spam

   Matching of the attribute name(s) MUST be case-insensitive.

4.2.  Response

   The response is expected to be an XML document.  The "format"
   parameter of the "application/reputon" media type MUST be "xml" when
   used in this mode.

   The XML schema definition describing the format of that response is
   included below.

4.2.1.  XML Schema

   The following XML schema describes the format of the reply:

   rater:  The identity of the agent making the assertion.

   rater-authenticity:  An expression by the rater of its confidence in
      the report it is giving.  Expressed as a decimal value between 0
      and 1 inclusive.

   assertion:  The assertion being made.  This MUST be an assertion
      registered within the specified application by IANA.

   extension:  (OPTIONAL) One or more application-specific vocabulary
      extensions and their corresponding values.  If present, each of
      these MUST be a vocabulary extension registered with IANA.

   rated:  The identity about which an assertion is being made.

   rating:  The value of the assertion.  This is a decimal number from 0
      to 1, with 0 meaning the assertion is completely false (according
      to the agent making the assertion) and 1 meaning the assertion is
      completely true.

   sample-size:  The count of data points the asserting agent used to
      produce the value provided in the previous element.

   updated:  The time at which the current rating was computed.
      Expressed in number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1,

   Here, reputation agent "rep.example.net" is asserting within the
   context of email that "example.com" appears to send spam 1.2% of the
   time, based on just short of 17 million messages analyzed or reported
   to date.  The identity "example.com", the subject of the query, is
   extracted from the analyzed messages using the [DKIM] "d=" parameter
   for messages where signatures validate.  The reputation agent is 95%
   confident of this result.  (See [RFCxxxx+5] for details about the
   registered email vocabulary.)


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo presents no actions for IANA.  Registration of the well-
   known URI "repute_template" will be done as defined in
   [WELL-KNOWN-URI] which is not a function of IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   This memo describes security considerations introduced by the media
   type defined here.

6.1.  General

   This memo is part of a series introducing a reputation query and
   response system (see Section 2).  The Security Considerations
   sections of the other memos should also be consulted.
