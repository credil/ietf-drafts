1.  Introduction

   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] defined the way of indicating resources on the
   Web. This specification defines a pair of reciprocal link relation
   types that may be used to express the relationship between a
   collection and its members.

   The link relation is intentionally generic, and it can be used with
   multiple media types in a wide variety of use cases.

2.  Link Relations

   The following link relation is defined.

2.1.  form

   When included in a resource which represents a collection, the 'form'
   link relation identifies a target resource that represents the form
   for adding a new member to the context collection.

   <html>
     <ul>
       <li>Entry Description 1</li>
       <li>Entry Description 2</li>
     </ul>
     <a href="..." rel="form">[Add New Entry]</a>
   </html>

   or

   { "collection": {
     "href": "...",

     "items": [{OBJECT}, {OBJECT}];

     "links": [
       {"href": "...", "rel": "form"}
     ]
   }}

   or

   <link rel="form" href="..." />

Internet-Draft           The Form Link Relation               April 2012


   When included in a resource which represents a member of a
   collection, the 'form' link relation identifies a target resource
   that represents a pre-populated form for editing the context
   resource.

   <html>
     ...
     <ul>
       <li>
         Entry Description 1
         <a href="..." rel="form">[Edit Entry]</a>
       </li>
       <li>
         Entry Description 2
         <a href="..." rel="form">[Edit Entry]</a>
       </li>
     </ul>
     ...
   </html>

   or

   { "collection": {
     "href": "...",

     "items": [
       {
         "href": "...",
         "data": [ARRAY],
         "links": [
           {"href": "...", "rel": "form"}
         ]
       }
     ];
   }}
