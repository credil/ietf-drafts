Internet-Draft            PCP Server Selection             November 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP Client
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] to contact its PCP Server(s) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]
   when receiving one or several PCP Names (e.g., DHCP
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp]).  This document is not specific to DHCP; it is
   applicable to any mechanism that configures server names.

   Multiple Names may be configured to a PCP Client in some deployment
   contexts such as multi-homing (see Appendix A).  It is out of scope
   of this document to enumerate all deployment scenarios which require
   multiple Names to be configured.

   This document assumes appropriate name resolution means (e.g.,
   Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123]) are available on the host client.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  PCP Server denotes a functional element which receives and
      processes PCP requests from a PCP Client.  A PCP Server can be co-
      located with or be separated from the function (e.g., NAT,
      Firewall) it controls.  Refer to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].
   o  PCP Client denotes a PCP software instance responsible for issuing
      PCP requests to a PCP Server.  Refer to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].
   o  Name is a string that can be passed to getaddrinfo (Section 6.1 of
      [RFC3493]), such as a DNS name, address literals, etc.  A name may
      be a fully qualified domain name (e.g., "myservice.example.com."),
      IPv4 address in dotted-decimal form (e.g., 192.0.2.33) or textual
      representation of an IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:db8::1).  Refer to
      [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp].


3.  Name Resolution

   Each configured Name is passed to the name resolution library (e.g.,
   Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123] or [RFC6055]) to retrieve the
   corresponding IP address(es) (IPv4 or IPv6).  Then, the PCP Client
   MUST follow the procedure specified in Section 4 to contact its PCP
   Server(s).

   A host may have multiple network interfaces (e.g, 3G, WiFi, etc.);
   each configured differently.  Each PCP Server learned MUST be
   associated with the interface via which it was learned.

4.  IP Address Selection

   This section specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP Client
   to contact its PCP Server(s) when receiving one or several PCP Names:

   1.  If only one PCP Name is configured: if a list of IP addresses is
       returned as a result of resolving the PCP Server Name, the PCP
       Client follows the procedure specified in Section 4.1.
   2.  If several PCP Names are configured: each Name is treated as a
       separate PCP Server.  Moreover, each Name may be resolved into
       one IP address or a list of IP addresses.  The PCP Client
       contacts in parallel the first IP address of each Name and
       follows the procedure specified in Section 4.1 for the list of IP
       addresses returned for each Name.  Section 5 provides some
       examples to illustrate this procedure.

   The discovery procedure may result in a PCP Client instantiating
   multiple mappings maintained by distinct PCP Servers.  The decision
   to use all these mappings or delete some of them is deployment-
   specific.  Only the client can decide whether all the mappings are
   needed or only a subset of them.

4.1.  Serial Queries

   The PCP Client initializes its Maximum Retransmission Count (MRC) to
   4.

   The PCP Client sends its PCP message to the PCP Server following the
   retransmission procedure specified in Section 8.1.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].  If no response is received after MRC attempts,
   the PCP Client tries with the next IP address in its list of PCP
   Server addresses.  If it has exhausted its list, the procedure is
   repeated every fifteen minutes until the PCP request is successfully
   answered.  If, when sending PCP requests the PCP Client receives an
   ICMP error (e.g., port unreachable, network unreachable) it SHOULD
   immediately try the next IP address in the list.  Once the PCP Client
   has successfully received a response from a PCP Server address on
   that interface, it sends subsequent PCP requests to that same server
   address until that PCP Server becomes non-responsive, which causes
   the PCP client to attempt to re-iterate the procedure starting with
   the first PCP Server address on its list.


5.  Examples

   The following sub-sections provide three examples to illustrate the
   procedure.

Internet-Draft            PCP Server Selection             November 2012


   For all these examples, let's suppose pcpserver-x, pcpserver-y and
   pcpserver-z are configured as PCP Names.

5.1.  Example 1

   Let's also suppose:

   * IPx1 and IPx2 are returned for pcpserver-x; IPx1 is not reachable.
   * IPy1 and IPy2 are returned for pcpserver-y; IPy1 is reachable
   * IPz1 and IPz2 are returned for pcpserver-z; IPz1 is reachable

   The procedure to contact the PCP Servers is as follows:

   * Send PCP requests to all servers: IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
   * Responses are received from IPy1 and IPz1 but not from IPx1
     - The request is re-sent to IPx1
     - If no response is received after four attempts, the request
       is sent to IPx2

5.2.  Example 2

   Now, if the following conditions are made:

   * IPx1 and IPx2 are returned for pcpserver-x; IPx1 is not reachable.
   * IPy1 and IPy2 are returned for pcpserver-y; IPy1 is reachable
   * IPz1 and IPz2 are returned for pcpserver-z; IPz1 is not reachable

   The procedure to contact the PCP Servers lead to the following:

   * Send PCP requests to all servers: IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
   * A response is received from IPy1 but not from IPx1 and IPz1
     - the requests are re-sent to IPx1 and IPz1
     - If no response is received after four attempts, the request
       is then sent to IPx2 and IPz2

5.3.  Example 3

   Let's suppose now that:

   * IPx1 and IPx2 are returned for pcpserver-x; IPx1 is not reachable.
   * IPy1 and IPy2 are returned for pcpserver-y; IPy1 is not reachable
   * IPz1 and IPz2 are returned for pcpserver-z; IPz1 is not reachable

   The procedure to contact the PCP Servers is as follows:

   * No answer is received for all requests
     - the requests are re-sent to IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
     - If no response is received after four attempts, the request
       is then sent to IPx2, IPy2 and IPz2

Appendix A.  Multihoming

   The main problem of a PCP multihoming situation can be succintly
   described as 'one PCP client, multiple PCP servers'.  As described in
   Section 4, if a PCP Client discovers multiple PCP Server names, it
   should send requests to all of them in parallel with the following
   assumptions:

   o  There is no requirement that multiple PCP Servers have the same
      capabilities.

   o  PCP requests to different servers are independent, the result of a
      PCP request to one server does not influence another.

   o  If PCP Servers provide NAT, it is out of scope how the client
      manages ports across PCP Servers.  For example, whether PCP Client
      requires all external ports to be the same or whether there are
      ports available at all.

   The following sub-sections describe multihoming examples to
   illustrate PCP client behavior.

A.1.  IPv6 Multihoming

   In this example of an IPv6 multihomed network, two or more routers
   co-located with firewalls are present on a single link shared with
   the host(s).  Each router is in turn connected to a different service
   provider network and the host in this environment would be offered
   multiple prefixes and advertised multiple DNS/NTP servers.  Consider
   a scenario in which firewalls within an IPv6 multihoming environment
   also implement a PCP Server.  PCP client learns of the available PCP
   servers using DHCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] or any other PCP server
   discovery technique defined in future specifications.  The PCP client
   will send PCP requests in parallel to each of the PCP Servers.

A.2.  IPv4 Multihoming

   In this example an IPv4 multihomed network described in 'NAT- or
   RFC2260-based Multihoming' (Section 3.3 of[RFC4116]), the gateway
   router is connected to different service provider networks.  This
   method uses PA addresses assigned by each transit provider to which
   the site is connected.  The site uses Network Address Translation
   (NAT) to translate the various provider addresses into a single set
   of private-use addresses within the site.  In such a case, two PCP
   servers have to be present to control NAT to each of the transit
   providers.  PCP client learns of the available PCP servers using DHCP
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] or any other PCP server discovery technique
   defined in future specifications.  The PCP client will send PCP
   requests in parallel to each of the PCP Servers.

A.3.  Multiple interfaces and Servers

   In case for Multihoming when an end host such as a mobile terminal
   has multiple interfaces concurrently active, for example, Wi-Fi and
   3G, a PCP client would discover different PCP Servers over different
   interfaces.  Although multiple interfaces are available, an
   application might choose to use just one based on, for example, cost
   and bandwidth requirements, and therefore would need to send PCP
   requests to just one PCP Server.
