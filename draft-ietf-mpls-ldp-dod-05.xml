    <abstract>
      <t>Seamless MPLS design enables a single IP/MPLS network to scale over
      core, metro and access parts of a large packet network infrastructure
      using standardized IP/MPLS protocols. One of the key goals of Seamless
      MPLS is to meet requirements specific to access, including high number
      of devices, their position in network topology and their compute and
      memory constraints that limit the amount of state access devices can
      hold.This can be achieved with LDP Downstream-on-Demand (LDP DoD) label
      advertisement. This document describes LDP DoD use cases and lists
      required LDP DoD procedures in the context of Seamless MPLS design.</t>

      <t>In addition, a new optional TLV type in the LDP label request message
      is defined for fast-up convergence.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls">Seamless MPLS
      design</xref> enables a single IP/MPLS network to scale over core, metro
      and access parts of a large packet network infrastructure using
      standardized IP/MPLS protocols. One of the key goals of Seamless MPLS is
      to meet requirements specific to access, including high number of
      devices, their position in network topology and their compute and memory
      constraints that limit the amount of state access devices can hold.</t>

      <t>In general MPLS Label Switching Routers implement either LDP or RSVP
      for MPLS label distribution.</t>

      <t>The focus of this document is on LDP, as Seamless MPLS design does
      not include a requirement for general purpose explicit traffic
      engineering and bandwidth reservation. Document concentrates on the
      unicast connectivity only. Multicast connectivity is subject for further
      study.</t>

      <t>In <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls">Seamless MPLS design
      </xref>, IP/MPLS protocol optimization is possible due to a relatively
      simple access network topologies. Examples of such topologies involving
      access nodes (AN) and aggregation nodes (AGN) include:</t>

      <t><list style="letters">
          <t hangText="">A single AN homed to a single AGN.</t>

          <t>A single AN dual-homed to two AGNs.</t>

          <t>Multiple ANs daisy-chained via a hub-AN to a single AGN.</t>

          <t>Multiple ANs daisy-chained via a hub-AN to two AGNs.</t>

          <t>Two ANs dual-homed to two AGNs.</t>

          <t>Multiple ANs chained in a ring and dual-homed to two AGNs.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The amount of IP RIB and FIB state on ANs can be easily controlled in
      the listed access topologies by using simple IP routing configuration
      with either static routes or dedicated access IGP. Note that in all of
      the above topologies AGNs act as the access border routers (access ABRs)
      connecting the access topology to the rest of the network. Hence in many
      cases it is sufficient for ANs to have a default route pointing towards
      AGNs in order to achieve complete network connectivity from ANs to the
      network.</t>

      <t>The amount of MPLS forwarding state however requires additional
      consideration. In general MPLS routers implement LDP Downstream
      Unsolicited (LDP DU) label advertisement <xref target="RFC5036"/> and
      advertise MPLS labels for all valid routes in their RIB. This is seen as
      an inadequate approach for ANs, which requires a small subset of the
      total routes (and associated labels) based on the required connectivity
      for the provisioned services. And although filters can be applied to
      those LDP DU labels advertisements, it is not seen as a suitable tool to
      facilitate any-to-any AN-driven connectivity between access and the rest
      of the MPLS network.</t>

      <t>This document describes an access node driven "subscription model"
      for label distribution in the access. The approach relies on the
      standard LDP Downstream-on-Demand (LDP DoD) label advertisements as
      specified in <xref target="RFC5036"/>. LDP DoD enables on-demand label
      distribution ensuring that only required labels are requested, provided
      and installed.</t>

      <t>The following sections describe a set of reference access topologies
      considered for LDP DoD usage and their associated IP routing
      configurations, followed by LDP DoD use cases and LDP DoD procedures in
      the context of Seamless MPLS design.</t>

      <t>The access network is either single or dual homed to AGN1x, with
      either a single or multiple parallel links to AGN1x.</t>

      <t>Seamless MPLS access network topologies can range from a single- or
      dual-homed access node to a chain or ring of access nodes, and use
      either static routing or access IGP. The following sections describe

      <section title="Access Topologies with Static Routing">
        <t>In most cases access nodes connect to the rest of the network using
        very simple topologies. Here static routing is sufficient to provide
        the required IP connectivity. The following topologies are considered
        for use with static routing and LDP DoD:</t>

        <t><list style="letters">
            <t>[I1] topology - a single AN homed to a single AGN.</t>

            <t>[V] topology - a single AN dual-homed to two AGNs.</t>

            <t>[U2] topology - two ANs dual-homed to two AGNs.</t>

            <t>[Y] topology - multiple ANs daisy-chained to two AGNs.</t>

      <section anchor="sec_service_provisioning_and_activation"
               title="Service Provisioning and Activation">
        <t>Following the initial setup phase described in <xref
        target="sec_initial_network_setup"/>, a specific access node, referred
        to as AN*, is provisioned with a network service. AN* relies on LDP
        DoD to request the required MPLS LSP(s) label(s) from downstream
        AN/AGN1x node(s). Note that LDP DoD operations are service agnostic,
        that is, they are the same independently of the services provisioned
        on the AN*.</t>

        <t>For illustration purposes two service types are described: MPLS
        PWE3 <xref target="RFC4447"/> service and BGP/MPLS IPVPN <xref
        target="RFC4364"/>.</t>

        <t>MPLS PWE3 service - for description simplicity it is assumed that a
        single segment pseudowire is signaled using targeted LDP FEC128
        (0x80), and it is provisioned with the pseudowire ID and the loopback
        IPv4 address of the destination node. The following IP/MPLS operations
        need to be completed on the AN* to successfully establish such PWE3
        service:<list style="letters">
            <t>LSP labels for destination /32 FEC (outgoing label) and the
            local /32 loopback (incoming label) need to be signaled using LDP
            DoD.</t>

            <t>Targeted LDP session over an associated TCP/IP connection needs
            to be established to the PWE3 destination PE. This is triggered by
            either an explicit targeted LDP session configuration on the AN*
            or automatically at the time of provisioning the PWE3
            instance.</t>

            <t>Local and remote PWE3 labels for specific FEC128 PW ID need to
            be signaled using targeted LDP and PWE3 signaling procedures <xref
            target="RFC4447"/>.</t>

            <t>Upon successful completion of the above operations, AN*
            programs its RIB/LIB and LFIB tables, and activates the MPLS PWE3
            service.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note - only minimum operations applicable to service connectivity
        have been listed. Other non IP/MPLS connectivity operations that may
        be required for successful service provisioning and activation are out
        of scope in this document.</t>

        <t>BGP/MPLS IPVPN service - for description simplicity it is assumed
        that AN* is provisioned with a unicast IPv4 IPVPN service (VPNv4 for
        short) <xref target="RFC4364"/>. The following IP/MPLS operations need
        to be completed on the AN* to successfully establish VPNv4
        service:</t>

        <t><list style="letters">
            <t>BGP peering sessions with associated TCP/IP connections need to
            be established with the remote destination VPNv4 PEs or Route
            Reflectors.</t>

            <t>Based on configured BGP policies, VPNv4 BGP NLRIs need to be
            exchanged between AN* and its BGP peers.</t>

            <t>Based on configured BGP policies, VPNv4 routes need to be
            installed in the AN* VRF RIB and FIB, with corresponding BGP
            next-hops.</t>

            <t>LSP labels for destination BGP next-hop /32 FEC (outgoing
            label) and the local /32 loopback (incoming label) need to be
            signaled using LDP DoD.</t>

            <t>Upon successful completion of above operations, AN* programs
            its RIB/LIB and LFIB tables, and activates the BGP/MPLS IPVPN
            service.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note - only minimum operations applicable to service connectivity
        have been listed. Other non IP/MPLS connectivity operations that may
        be required for successful service provisioning are out of scope in
        this document.</t>

        <t>To establish an LSP for destination /32 FEC for any of the above
        services, AN* looks up its local routing table for a matching route,
        selects the best next-hop(s) and associated outgoing link(s).</t>

        <t>If a label for this /32 FEC is not already installed based on the
        configured static route with LDP DoD request policy or access IGP RIB
        entry, AN* must send an LDP DoD label mapping request. Downstream
        AN/AGN1x LSR(s) checks its RIB for presence of the requested /32 and
        associated valid outgoing label binding, and if both are present,
        replies with its label for this FEC and installs this label as
        incoming in its LIB and LFIB. Upon receiving the label mapping the AN*
        must accept this label based on the exact route match of advertised
        FEC and route entry in its RIB or based on the longest match in line
        with <xref target="RFC5283">Inter-area LDP</xref>. If the AN* accepts
        the label it must install it as an outgoing label in its LIB and
        LFIB.</t>

        <t>In access topologies [V] and [Y], if AN* is dual homed to two AGN1x
        and routing entries for these AGN1x are configured as equal cost
        paths, AN* must send LDP DoD label requests to both AGN1x devices and
        install all received labels in its LIB and LFIB.</t>

        <t>In order for AN* to implement IPFRR LFA local-repair, AN* must also
        send LDP DoD label requests to alternate next-hops per its RIB, and
        install received labels as alternate entries in its LIB and LFIB.</t>

        <t>When forwarding PWE3 or VPNv4 packets AN* chooses the LSP label
        based on the locally configured static /32 or default route, or
        default route signaled via access IGP. If a route is reachable via
        multiple interfaces to AGN1x nodes and the route has multiple equal
        cost paths, AN* must implement Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
        functionality. This involves AN* using hash-based load-balancing
        mechanism and sending the PWE3 or VPNv4 packets in a flow-aware manner
        with appropriate LSP labels via all equal cost links.</t>

        <t>ECMP mechanism is applicable in an equal manner to parallel links
        between two network elements and multiple paths towards the
        destination. The traffic demand is distributed over the available
        paths.</t>

        <t>AGN1x node on the network side may use <xref target="RFC3107">BGP
        labeled unicast</xref> in line with <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls">Seamless MPLS design </xref>. In
        such case AGN1x will be redistributing its static routes (or routes
        received from the access IGP) pointing to local ANs into BGP labeled
        unicast to facilitate network-to-access traffic flows. Likewise, to
        facilitate access-to-network traffic flows AGN1x will be responding to
        access originated LDP DoD label requests with label mappings based on
        its BGP labeled unicast reachability for requested FECs.</t>

          the AN failure towards the core network. This should involve
          removing associated routes (in access IGP case) and labels from its

      <section title="LDP Label Distribution Control and Retention Modes">
        <t><xref target="RFC5036">LDP protocol specification</xref> defines
        two modes for label distribution control, following the definitions in
        <xref target="RFC3031">MPLS architecture</xref>:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Independent mode &ndash; an LSR recognizes a particular FEC and
            makes a decision to bind a label to the FEC independently from
            distributing that label binding to its label distribution peers. A
            new FEC is recognized whenever a new route becomes valid on the
            LSR.</t>

            <t>Ordered mode &ndash; an LSR needs to bind a label to a
            particular FEC if it knows how to forward packets for that FEC (
            i.e. it has a route corresponding to that FEC ) and if it has
            already received at least one label request message from an
            upstream LSR.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Using independent label distribution control with LDP DoD and
        access static routing would prevent the access LSRs from propagating
        label binding failure along the access topology, making it impossible
        for upstream LSR to be notified about the downstream failure and for
        an application using the LSP to switchover to an alternate path, even
        if such a path exists.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC5036">LDP protocol specification</xref> defines
        two modes for label retention, following the definitions in <xref
        target="RFC3031">MPLS architecture</xref>:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Conservative mode - If operating in Downstream on Demand mode,
            an LSR will request label mappings only from the next hop LSR
            according to routing. The main advantage of the conservative mode
            is that only the labels that are required for the forwarding of
            data are allocated and maintained. This is particularly important
            in LSRs where the label space is inherently limited, such as in an
            ATM switch. A disadvantage of the conservative mode is that if
            routing changes the next hop for a given destination, a new label
            must be obtained from the new next hop before labeled packets can
            be forwarded.</t>

            <t>Liberal mode - When operating in Downstream on Demand mode with
            Liberal Label retention, an LSR might choose to request label
            mappings for all known prefixes from all peer LSRs. The main
            advantage of the Liberal Label retention mode is that reaction to
            routing changes can be quick because labels already exist. The
            main disadvantage of the liberal mode is that unneeded label
            mappings are distributed and maintained.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note that the conservative label retention mode would prevent LSRs
        from requesting and maintaining label mappings for any backup routes
        that are not used for forwarding. This in turn would prevent the
        access LSRs (AN and AGN1x nodes) from implementing any local
        protection schemes that rely on using alternate next-hops in case of
        the primary next-hop failure. Such schemes include IPFRR LFA if access
        IGP is used, or a primary and backup static route configuration. Using
        LDP DoD in combination with liberal retention mode allows the LSR to
        request labels for the specific FEC from primary next-hop LSR(s) and
        the alternate next-hop LSR(s) for this FEC.</t>

        <t>Note that even though LDP DoD operates in a liberal retention mode,
        if used with access IGP and if no LFA exists, the LDP DoD will
        introduce additional delay in traffic restoration as the labels for
        the new next-hop will get requested only after the access IGP
        convergence.</t>

        <t>Adhering to the overall design goals of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls">Seamless MPLS</xref>,
        specifically achieving a large network scale without compromising fast
        service restoration, all access LSRs (AN and AGN1x nodes) MUST use LDP

        IGP) and the network-side ( using <xref target="RFC3107">BGP labeled

          <t>In some conditions, the exponential backoff algorithm usage

          a longer than desired wait time to get a successful LDP label to
          route mapping. An example is when a specific route is unavailable on
          the downstream LSR when the label mapping request from the upstream
          is received, but later comes back. In such case using the

          <t>Fast-up convergence can be addressed with a minor extension to

          <t>The operation is as follows.</t>

          <t>To benefit from the fast-up convergence improvement, the upstream
          LSR sends a Label Request message with a Queue Request TLV.</t>

          <t>If the downstream LSR supports the Queue Request TLV, it verifies
          if route is available and if so it replies with label mapping as per
          existing LDP procedures.</t>

          <t>If the route is not available, the downstream LSR queues the
          request and replies as soon as the route becomes available. In the
          meantime, it does not send a "no route" notification back. When
          sending a label request with the Queue Request TLV, the upstream LSR
          does not retry the Label Request message if it does not receive a
          reply from its downstream peer</t>

          <t>If the upstream LSR wants to abort an outstanding label request
          while the Label Request is queued in the downstream LSR, the
          upstream LSR sends a Label Abort Request message, making the
          downstream LSR to remove the original request from the queue and
          send back a notification Label Request Aborted <xref
          target="RFC5036"/>.</t>

          <t>If the downstream LSR does not support the Queue Request TLV, it
          will silently ignores it, and sends a "no route" notification back.
          In this case the upstream LSR invokes the exponential backoff
          algorithm described in <xref target="sec_label_request_retry"/>.</t>

          <t>This described procedure ensures backward compatitibility.</t>

      <section title="Label Withdraw">
        <t>If an MPLS label on the downstream access LSR/ABR is no longer
        valid, the downstream access LSR/ABR withdraws this FEC/label binding
        from the upstream access LSR/ABR with the Label Withdraw Message <xref
        target="RFC5036"/> with a specified label TLV or with an empty label
        TLV.</t>

        <t>Downstream access LSR/ABR SHOULD withdraw a label for specific FEC
        in the following cases: <list style="letters">
            <t>If LDP DoD ingress label is associated with an outgoing label

        <t>The upstream access LSR/ABR responds to the Label Withdraw Message
        with the Label Release Message <xref target="RFC5036"/>.</t>

        <t>After sending label release message to downstream access LSR/ABR,
        the upstream access LSR/ABR should resend label request message,
        assuming upstream access LSR/ABR still requires the label.</t>

        <t>Downstream access LSR/ABR should withdraw a label if the local
        route configuration (e.g. /32 loopback) is deleted.</t>

        <t>Note: For any events inducing next hop change, downstream access
        LSR/ABR should attempt to converge the LSP locally before withdrawing
        the label from an upstream access LSR/ABR. For example if the next-hop
        changes for a particular FEC and if the new next-hop allocates labels
        by LDP DoD session, then the downstream access LSR/ABR must send a
        label request on the new next-hop session. If downstream access
        LSR/ABR doesn&lsquo;t get label mapping for some duration, then and

      <section title="Local Repair">
        <t>To support local-repair with ECMP and IPFRR LFA, access LSR/ABR

        procedures in <xref target="sec_label_request"/>. If remote LFA is
        enabled, access LSR/ABR needs a label from its alternate next-hop
        toward the PQ node and needs a label from the remote PQ node toward
        its FEC/destination. If access LSR/ABR doesn't already know those
        labels, it MUST request them.</t>

        <t>This will enable access LSR/ABR to pre-program the alternate

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>MPLS LDP Downstream on Demand deployment in the access network is
      subject to similar security threats as any MPLS LDP deployment. It is
      recommended that baseline security measures are considered as described
      in the <xref target="RFC5036">LDP specification</xref> including
      ensuring authenticity and integrity of LDP messages, as well as
      protection against spoofing and Denial of Service attacks.</t>

      <t>Some deployments may require increased measures of network security
      if a subset of Access Nodes are placed in locations with lower levels of
      physical security e.g. street cabinets (common practice for VDSL
      access). In such cases it is the responsibility of the system designer
      to take into account the physical security measures (environmental
      design, mechanical or electronic access control, intrusion detection),
      as well as monitoring and auditing measures (configuration and Operating
      System changes, reloads, routes advertisements).</t>

      <t>But even with all this in mind, the designer still should consider
      network security risks and adequate measures arising from the lower
      level of physical security of those locations.</t>

      <section title="Security and LDP DoD">
        <t/>

        <section title="Access to network packet flow direction">
          <t>An important property of MPLS LDP Downstream on Demand operation
          is that the upstream LSR (requesting LSR) accepts only mappings it
          sent a request for (in other words the ones it is interested in),
          and does not accept any unsolicited label mappings by design.</t>

          <t>This limits the potential of an unauthorized third party fiddling
          with label mappings operations on the wire. It also enables ABR LSR
          to monitor behaviour of any Access LSR in case the latter gets
          compromised and attempts to get access to an unauthorized FEC or
          remote LSR. Note that ABR LSR is effectively acting as a gateway to
          the MPLS network, and any label mapping requests made by any Access
          LSR are processed and can be monitored on this ABR LSR.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Network to access packet flow direction">
          <t>Another important property of MPLS LDP DoD operation in the
          access is that the number of access nodes and associated MPLS FECs
          per ABR LSR is not large in number, and they are all known at the
          deployment time. Hence any changes of the access MPLS FECs can be
          easily controlled and monitored on the ABR LSR.</t>

          <t>And then, even in the event when Access LSR manages to advertise
          a FEC that belongs to another LSR (e.g. in order to
          &lsquo;steal&rsquo; third party data flows, or breach a privacy of
          VPN), such Access LSR will have to influence the routing decision
          for affected FEC on the ABR LSR. Following measures SHOULD be
          considered to prevent such event from occurring:</t>

          <t><list style="letters">
              <t>ABR LSR - access side with static routes - this is not
              possible for Access LSR. Access LSR has no way to influence ABR
              LSR routing decisions due to static nature of routing
              configuration here.</t>

              <t>ABR LSR &ndash; access side with IGP - this is still not
              possible if the compromised Access LSR is a leaf in the access
              topology (leaf node in topologies I1, I, V, Y described earlier
              in this document), due to the leaf metrics being configured on
              the ABR LSR. If the compromised Access LSR is a transit LSR in
              the access topology (transit node in topologies I, Y, U), it is
              possible for this Access LSR to attract to itself traffic
              destined to the nodes upstream from it. However elaborate such
              &lsquo;man in the middle attack&rsquo; is possible, but can be
              quickly detected by upstream Access LSRs not receiving traffic,
              and legitimate traffic from them getting dropped.</t>

              <t>ABR LSR - network side - designer SHOULD consider giving a
              higher administrative preference to the labeled unicast BGP
              routes vs. access IGP routes.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In summary MPLS in access design with LDP DoD has number of
          native properties that prevent number of security attacks and make
          their detection quick and straightforward.</t>

          <t>Following two sections describe other security considerations
          applicable to general MPLS deployments in the access.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Data Plane Security">
        <t>Data plane security risks applicable to the access MPLS network are
        listed below (a non-exhaustive list):</t>

        <t><list style="letters">
            <t>packets from a specific access node flow to an altered
            transport layer or service layer destination.</t>

            <t>packets belonging to undefined services flow to and from the
            access network.</t>

            <t>unlabelled packets destined to remote network nodes.</t>
          </list>Following mechanisms should be considered to address listed
        data plane security risks:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>addressing (a) - Access and ABR LSRs SHOULD NOT accept labeled
            packets over a particular data link, unless from the Access or ABR
            LSR perspective this data link is known to attach to a trusted
            system based on employed authentication mechanism(s), and the top
            label has been distributed to the upstream neighbour by the
            receiving Access or ABR LSR.</t>

            <t>addressing (a) &ndash; ABR LSR MAY restrict network
            reachability for access devices to a subset of remote network LSR,
            based on authentication or other network security technologies
            employed towards Access LSRs. Restricted reachability can be
            enforced on the ABR LSR using local routing policies, and can be
            distributed towards the core MPLS network using routing policies
            associated with access MPLS FECs.</t>

            <t>addressing (b) - labeled service routes (e.g. MPLS/VPN, tLDP)
            are not accepted from unreliable routing peers. Detection of
            unreliable routing peers is achieved by engaging routing protocol
            detection and alarm mechanisms, and is out of scope of this
            document.</t>

            <t>addressing (a) and (b) - no successful attacks have been
            mounted on the control plane and has been detected.</t>

            <t>addressing (c) - ABR LSR MAY restrict IP network reachability
            to and from the access LSR.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Control Plane Security">
        <t>Similarly to <xref target="RFC4364">Inter-AS MPLS/VPN
        deployments</xref>, the data plane security depends on the security of
        the control plane.</t>

        <t>To ensure control plane security access LDP DoD connections MUST
        only be made with LDP peers that are considered trusted from the local
        LSR perspective, meaning they are reachable over a data link that is
        known to attach to a trusted system based on employed authentication
        mechanism(s) on the local LSR.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="RFC5925">TCP/IP MD5 authentication option</xref>
        should be used with LDP as described in <xref target="RFC5036">LDP
        specification</xref>. If TCP/IP MD5 authentication is considered not
        secure enough, the designer may consider using a more elaborate and
        advanced TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO RFC 5925) for LDP session
        authentication.</t>

        <t>Access IGP (if used) and any routing protocols used in access
        network for signalling service routes SHOULD also be secured in a
        similar manner.</t>

        <t>For increased level of authentication in the control plane security
        for a subset of access locations with lower physical security,
        designer could also consider using:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>different crypto keys for use in authentication procedures for
            these locations.</t>

            <t>stricter network protection mechanisms including DoS
            protection, interface and session flap dampening.</t>
