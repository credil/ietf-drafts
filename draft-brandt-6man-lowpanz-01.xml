      <section title="Reader's guidance">
        <t>This document borrows heavily from RFC4944, "Transmission of IPv6
        Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks". The process of creating this
        document was mainly a simplification; removing the following
        topics:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

            <t>Fragmentation layer</t>

        G.9959 NodeIDs.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The ITU-T G.9959 recommendation <xref target="G.9959"/> targets
      low-power Personal Area Networks (PANs). This document defines the frame
      format for transmission of IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"/> packets as well
      as the formation of IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly
      autoconfigured IPv6 addresses on G.9959 networks.</t>

      <t>The general approach is to adapt elements of <xref target="RFC4944"/>
      to G.9959 networks. G.9959 provides a Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR)
      layer for transmission of datagrams larger than the G.9959 MAC PDU.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6775"/> updates <xref target="RFC4944"/> by
      specifying LoWPAN optimizations for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
      (originally defined by <xref target="RFC4861"/>). This document limits
      the use of <xref target="RFC6775"/> to prefix and Context ID assignment.
      It is described how to construct an IID from a G.9959 link-layer
      address. Refer to <xref target="LowpanAddressing"/>. If using that
      method, Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is not needed. Address
      registration is only needed in certain cases.</t>

      <t>In addition to IPv6 application communication, the frame format
      defined in this document may be used by IPv6 routing protocols such as
      <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref> or <xref
      target="P2P-RPL">P2P-RPL</xref> to implement IPv6 routing over G.9959
      networks.</t>

      <t>G.9959 networks may implement mesh routing between nodes below the IP
      layer. Mesh routing is out of scope of this document.</t>

    <section title="G.9959 parameters to use for IPv6 transport">
      <t>This chapter outlines properties applying to the PHY and MAC of
      G.9959 and how to use these for IPv6 transport.</t>

      <section title="Addressing mode">
        <t>G.9959 defines how a unique 32-bit HomeID network identifier is
        assigned by a network controller and how an 8-bit NodeID host
        identifier is allocated. NodeIDs are unique within the logical network
        identified by the HomeID. The logical network identified by the HomeID
        maps directly to an IPv6 subnet identified by one or more IPv6
        prefixes.</t>

        <t>An IPv6 host SHOULD construct its link-local IPv6 address and
        routable IPv6 addresses from the NodeID in order to facilitate IP
        header compression as described in <xref target="RFC6282"/>.</t>

        <t>A word of caution: since HomeIDs and NodeIDs are handed out by a
        network controller function during inclusion, identifier validity and
        uniqueness is limited by the lifetime of the logical network
        membership. This can be cut short by a mishap occurring to the network
        controller. Having a single point of failure at the network controller
        suggests that deployers of high-reliability applications should
        carefully consider adding redundancy to the network controller
        function.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 Multicast support">
        <t><xref target="RFC3819"/> recommends that IP subnetworks support
        (subnet-wide) multicast. G.9959 supports direct-range IPv6 multicast
        while subnet-wide multicast is not supported natively by G.9959.
        Subnet-wide multicast may be provided by an IP routing protocol or a
        mesh routing protocol operating below the LoWPAN layer. Routing
        protocols are out of scope of this document.</t>

        <t>IPv6 multicast packets MUST be carried via G.9959 broadcast.</t>

        <t>As per <xref target="G.9959"/>, this is accomplished as
        follows:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The destination HomeID of the G.9959 MAC PDU MUST be the HomeID
            of the logical network</t>

            <t>The destination NodeID of the G.9959 MAC PDU MUST be the
            broadcast NodeID (0xff)</t>
          </list>G.9959 broadcast MAC PDUs are only intercepted by nodes
        within the logical network identified by the HomeID.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="G.9959 MAC PDU size and IPv6 MTU">
        <t>IPv6 packets MUST use G.9959 transmission profiles which support
        MAC PDU payload sizes of 150 bytes or higher, e.g. the R3 profile.
        G.9959 profiles R1 and R2 only supports MPDU payloads around 40 bytes
        and the transmission speed is down to 9.6kbit/s.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC2460"/> specifies that IPv6 packets may be up to
        1280 octets. However, a full IPv6 packet does not fit in an G.9959 MAC
        PDU. The maximum G.9959 R3 MAC PDU payload size is 158 octets.
        Link-layer security imposes an overhead, which in the extreme case
        leaves 130 octets available.</t>

        <t>G.9959 provides Segmentation And Reassembly for payloads up to 1350
        octets. Segmentation however adds further overhead. It is therefore
        desirable that datagrams can fit into a single G.9959 MAC PDU. IPv6
        Header Compression <xref target="RFC6282"/> improves the chances that
        a short IPv6 packet can fit into a single G.9959 frame.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Transmission status indications">
        <t>The G.9959 MAC layer provides native acknowledgement and
        retransmission of MAC PDUs. The G.9959 SAR layer does the same for
        larger datagrams. A mesh routing layer may provide a similar feature
        for routed communication. Acknowledgment and retransmission improves
        the transmission success rate and frees higher layers from the burden
        of implementing individual retransmission schemes. An IPv6 routing
        stack communicating over G.9959 may utilize link-layer status
        indications such as delivery confirmation and Ack timeout from the MAC
        layer.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Transmission security">
        <t>Implementations claiming conformance with this document MUST enable
        G.9959 common network key security.</t>

        <t>The network key is intended to address security requirements in the
        home at the normal security requirements level. For applications with
        high or very high requirements on confidentiality and/or integrity,
        such as door locks and meters, additional application layer security
        measures for end-to-end authentication and encryption will need to be
        applied. The availability of the network relies on the security
        properties of the network key in any case.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="LoWPAN Adaptation Layer and Frame Format">
      <t>The LoWPAN encapsulation formats defined in this chapter are the
      payload in the G.9959 MAC PDU. IPv6 header compression <xref
      target="RFC6282"/> MUST be supported by implementations of this
      specification.</t>

      <t>All LoWPAN datagrams transported over G.9959 are prefixed by a LoWPAN
      encapsulation header stack. The LoWPAN payload (e.g. an IPv6 packet)
      follows this encapsulation header. Each header in the header stack
      contains a header type followed by zero or more header fields. An IPv6
      header stack may contain, in the following order, addressing, hop-by-hop
      options, routing, fragmentation, destination options, and finally
      payload <xref target="RFC2460"/>. The LoWPAN header format is structured
      the same way. Currently only payload options are defined for the LoWPAN
      header format.</t>

      <t>The definition of LoWPAN headers consists of the dispatch value, the
      definition of the header fields that follow, and their ordering
      constraints relative to all other headers. Although the header stack
      structure provides a mechanism to address future demands on the LoWPAN
      adaptation layer, it is not intended to provide general purpose
      extensibility. This document specifies a small set of 6LoWPAN header
      types using the 6LoWPAN header stack for clarity, compactness, and
      orthogonality.</t>

          for sending RAs, the M flag MUST NOT be set. As stated by <xref
          target="RFC6775"/>, an ABR is responsible for managing prefix(es).
          Global prefixes may change over time. It is RECOMMENDED that a ULA
          prefix is always assigned to the LoWPAN subnet to facilitate stable
          site-local application associations based on IPv6 addresses.
          Prefixes used in the LoWPAN subnet are distributed by normal RA
          mechanisms. The 6LoWPAN Context Option (6CO) is used according to
          <xref target="RFC6775"/> in an RA to disseminate Context IDs (CID)
          to use for compressing prefixes. Prefixes and corresponding Context
          IDs MUST be assigned during initial node inclusion. Nodes MUST renew
          the prefix and CID according to the lifetime signaled by the ABR.
          <xref target="RFC6775"/> specifies that the maximum value of the RA
          Router Lifetime field MAY be up to 0xFFFF. This document further
          specifies that the value 0xFFFF MUST be interpreted as infinite
          lifetime. This value SHOULD NOT be used by ABRs. Its use is only
          intended for a sleeping network controller; for instance a battery
          powered remote control being master for a small island-mode network
          of light modules. CIDs SHOULD be used in a cyclic fashion to assist
          battery powered nodes with no real-time clock. When updating context
          information, a CID may have its lifetime set to zero to obsolete it.
          The CID SHOULD NOT be reused immediately; rather the next vacant CID
          should be assigned. An ABR detecting the use of an obsoleted CID
          SHOULD immediately send an RA with updated Context Information.
          Header compression based on CIDs MUST NOT be used for RA messages
          carrying Context Information. An expired CID and the associated
          prefix SHOULD NOT be reset but rather retained in receive-only mode
          if there is no other current need for the CID value. This will allow
          an ABR to detect if a sleeping node without clock uses an expired
          CID and in response, the LBR SHOULD immediately return an RA with
          fresh Context Information to the originator. Except for the specific
          redefinition of the RA Router Lifetime value 0xFFFF, the above text
          is in compliance with <xref target="RFC6775"/>.</t>

      <t>IPv6 header fields SHOULD be compressed. If IPv6 header compression
      is used, it MUST be according to <xref target="RFC6282"/>. This section
      will simply identify substitutions that should be made when interpreting
      the text of [RFC6282].</t>

      <t>In general the following substitutions should be made:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Replace "802.15.4" with "G.9959"</t>

          <t>Replace "802.15.4 short address" with
          "&lt;Interface&gt;&lt;G.9959 NodeID&gt;"</t>

          <t>Replace "802.15.4 PAN ID" with "G.9959 HomeID"</t>
        </list>When a 16-bit address is called for (i.e., an IEEE 802.15.4
      "short address") it MUST be formed by prepending an Interface label byte
      to the G.9959 NodeID:</t>

      </figure>

      <t><vspace blankLines="1"/>A transmitting node may be sending to an IPv6
      destination address which can be reconstructed from the link-layer
      destination address. If the Interface number is zero (the default
      value), all IPv6 address bytes may be elided. Likewise, the Interface
      number of a fully elided IPv6 address (i.e. SAM/DAM=11) may be
      reconstructed to the value zero by a receiving node.</t>

      <t>64 bit 802.15.4 address details MUST be ignored. This document only
      specifies the use of short addresses.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The method of derivation of Interface Identifiers from 8-bit NodeIDs
      preserves uniqueness within the logical network. However, there is no
      protection from duplication through forgery. Neighbor Discovery in
      G.9959 links may be susceptible to threats as detailed in <xref
      target="RFC3756"/>. G.9959 networks may feature mesh routing. This
      implies additional threats due to ad hoc routing as per [KW03]. G.9959
      provides capability for link-layer security. G.9959 nodes MUST use
      link-layer security with a common key. Doing so will alleviate the
      majority of threats stated above. A sizeable portion of G.9959 devices
      is expected to always communicate within their PAN (i.e., within their
      subnet, in IPv6 terms). In response to cost and power consumption
      considerations, these devices will typically implement the minimum set
      of features necessary. Accordingly, security for such devices may rely
      on the mechanisms defined at the link layer by G.9959. G.9959 relies on
      the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for authentication and encryption
      of G.9959 frames and further employs challenge-response handshaking to
      prevent replay attacks.</t>

      <t>It is also expected that some G.9959 devices (e.g. billing and/or
      safety critical products) will implement coordination or integration
      functions. These may communicate regularly with IPv6 peers outside the
      subnet. Such IPv6 devices are expected to secure their end-to-end
      communications with standard security mechanisms (e.g., IPsec, TLS,
      etc).</t>
