    <abstract>
      <t>
      This document describes mechanism to enable media stream establishment in the presence of NATs, firewalls and HTTP proxies.
HTTP proxy and firewall policies applied in many private network domains introduce obstacles to the successful establishment of media stream via RTCWEB.
      This document examines some of these policies and
      develops requirements on the web browsers designed to provide the best possible chance of
      media connectivity between RTCWEB peers.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      Many organizations, e.g. an enterprise, a public service agency or a university, deploy
      NATs and firewalls at the border to the public internet.
      RTCWEB relies on ICE <xref target="RFC5245"></xref> in order to establish
      a media path between two RTCWEB peers in the presence of such NATs/FWs.
      As last resort in order to cater for NAT/FWs with address and port dependent filtering characteristics
      <xref target="RFC4787"></xref>,
      the peers will introduce a TURN server
      <xref target="RFC5766"></xref>
      in the public internet as a media relay.
      Aspects of TURN server deployment in the RTCWEB environment are also considered in
      <xref target="draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements"></xref>
      </t>
      <t>
      If an organization wants to support RTCWEB such a TURN server may be located in the DMZ of the      private network of that organization where it is still under administrative control.

      </t>
      <t>
      In certain environments with very restrictive FW policies a TURN server in the
      public internet may not be sufficient to establish connectivity towards the RTCWEB peer      for RTP-based media
       <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.
      Such policies can include blocking of all UDP based traffic and allowing only HTTP(S) traffic       to the TCP ports 80/443.
      In addition access to the World Wide Web from inside an organization is often only possible      via a HTTP proxy.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document examines impact of NAT/FW policies in
      <xref target="pure_FW"></xref>.
      Additional impacts due to the presence of a HTTP proxy are examined in
      <xref target="proxy_FW"></xref>.

    <section anchor="pure_FW" title="Considerations for NATs/Firewalls independent of HTTP proxies">
     <t>
     This section covers aspects of how NAT/FW characteristic influence the establishement of a media stream.
     Additional aspects introduced by the presence of a HTTP proxy are covered in <xref target="proxy_FW"/>.
          </t>
     <t>
     If the NAT shows port and address dependent filtering     behavior there is the need for a TURN server arises in order to establish     connectivity for media streams.
     The TURN server will relay the RTP packet to the RTCWEB peer using UDP.
     How the RTP packets are sent from the RTCWEB client within the private network to the TURN server     depends on what the firewall will let pass through.
          </t>
     <t>
     Other types of NATs do not require using the TURN relay.
     Nevertheless, the FW rules and policies still affect how media streams can be established.
     </t>

            <section anchor="pure_FW_tcp_udp" title="Firewall open for outgoing UDP and TCP traffic">
             <t>
              This scenario assumes that the NAT/FW is transparent for all outgoing              traffic independent of using UDP or TCP as transport protocol.
              This case is used as starting point for introduction of a more restrictive              firewall.
              It presents the least critical example with respect to the              establishment of the media streams.

             </t>
             <t>
             The TURN server can be reached directly from within via the NAT/FW and             the ICE procedures will reveal that media can be sent via the TURN server.
             The TURN client will send its media to the allocated resources at the TURN server via UDP.
             </t>
             <t>
             Dependent on the port range that is used for RTCWEB media streams,             the same statement would be true if the NAT/Firewall would allow UDP traffic             for that ports only.
             </t>

            </section>
            <section anchor="pure_FW_tcp" title="Firewall open only for TCP traffic">
             <t>
             This scenario assumes that the NAT/FW is transparent for outgoing traffic
             only using TCP as transport protocol.
             This gives two options for media stream establishment dependent on the NAT's filering
             characteristics. Either transport RTP over TCP or contacting the TURN server via TCP.
             </t>
             <t>In the first case the browser needs use ICE-TCP <xref target="RFC6544"/>
             and could launch a successful connectivity check directly to the remote endpoint.
             </t>
             <t>In the second case the browser needs to contact the TURN server via TCP for allocation of
             an UDP-based relay address at the TURN server.
             The ICE procedures will reveal that RTP media can be sent via the TURN relay using
             the TCP connection between TURN client and TURN server.
             </t>
             <t>
             The TURN server would then relay the RTP packets using UDP.
             ICE-TCP <xref target="RFC6544"/> is not needed in this context.
             </t>
             </section>

            <section anchor="pure_FW_http" title="Firewall open only for TCP-based HTTP(s) traffic">
            <t>
            In this case the firewall blocks all outgoing traffic except for TCP traffic to            port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS.
            A TURN server listening to its default ports (3478 for TCP/UDP, 5349 for TLS)            would not be reachable in this case.
            </t>
            <t>
            However, the TURN server could still be reached when it is configured to            listen to the HTTP(S) ports as well.
            In addition the RTCWEB clients need to be configured to contact            the TURN server over the HTTP(S) ports.
            </t>

    </section>
    <section anchor="proxy_FW" title="Considerations for NATs/Firewalls in presence of HTTP proxies">
    <t>
    This section considers a scenario where all HTTP(S) traffic is routed via an HTTP proxy.
    Note: If both RTCWEB clients are located behind the same HTTP proxies,
    we, of course, assume that ICE would give us a direct media connection within the private network.
    We consider this case as out of the scope of this document.

             As in
             <xref target="pure_FW_tcp_udp"/>
             we assume that the NAT/FW is transparent for all outgoing traffic             independent of using UDP or TCP as transport protocol.
             Consequently, the same considerations as in
             <xref target="pure_FW_tcp_udp"/>
             apply with respect to the traversal of the NAT/FW.

             As in
             <xref target="pure_FW_tcp"/>
             we assume that the NAT/FW is transparent only for outgoing TCP traffic
             Consequently, the same consideration as in
             <xref target="pure_FW_tcp"/>
             apply with respect to the traversal of the NAT/FW.
             </t>

             </section>

           <section anchor="proxy_relay" title="HTTP proxy assisted TURN server connection">
               <section anchor="proxy_relay_turn" title="TURN server connection via TCP">
               <t>
               Different from the previous scenarios, we assume that the NAT/FW accepts outgoing traffic
               only via a TCP connection that is initiated from the HTTP proxy.
               Consequently, a RTCWEB client would have to use the HTTP CONNECT method in order to get access to
               the TURN server via the HTTP proxy.
               The HTTP CONNECT request needs to convey the TURN Server URI or transport address.
               Afterwards, the RTCWEB client could upgrade the connection to use TLS,
               forward STUN/TURN traffic via the HTTP proxy and use the TURN server as media relay.
               </t>
               <t>
               If it is not possible to use HTTP CONNECT in this way, WebRTC will not work.
               We consider this case as out of the scope of this document.
               </t>
               <t>
               Strictly speaking the TLS upgrade is not necessary, but using TLS would also prevent
               the HTTP proxy from sniffing into the data stream and provides the same flow as HTTPS
               and might improve interoperability with proxy servers.
               Some tests (done a while ago) indicated that there are DPI proxies that expect to see
               at least a SSL handshake and, possibly, valid SSL records.
               The application has the ability to control whether SSL is used by the parameters it
               supplies to the TURN URI (e.g. turns: vs turn:), so the decision
               to do TURN/TCP to port 443 versus TURN/TLS to port 443 could be left up to the application.
               </t>
               <t>
                In contrast to using UDP or TCP for transport of STUN messages, the browser would now need
               to first establish a HTTP over TCP connection to the HTTP proxy,
               upgrade to using TLS and then switch to
               using  this TLS connection for transport of STUN messages.
               It is also desirable that the browser detects the need to connect to the TURN server
               through a HTTP proxy automatically in order to achieve seamless deployment and interoperability.
               The browser should use the same proxy selection procedure for TURN as currently done for HTTP.
               The user or network administrator should not be required to change browser or
               proxy script configuration.
               </t>

               <section anchor="proxy_relay_tcp" title="TURN server connection via UDP">
               <t>
               If a local TURN server under administrative control of the organization is deployed
               it is desirable to reach this TURN server via UDP.
               The TURN server could be specified in the proxy configuration script,
               giving the browser the possibility to learn how to access it.
               Then, when gathering candidates, this TURN server would always be used such the
               RTCWWEB client application could get UDP traffic out to the internet.
