 Router Advertisement based privacy extension in IPv6 autoconfiguration
                  <draft-rafiee-6man-ra-privacy-01.txt>

Abstract

   Privacy is an important issue for many governments [eurolaw] and 
   users where its importance becomes more evident every day. Nodes 
   might change their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being 
   tracked by attackers and which also results in the prevention of 
   information being leaked from their nodes. In IPv6 networks there is 
   currently one solution for maintaining privacy for nodes when IPv6 
   StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC 4662) is used. 
   Unfortunately this solution, i.e., Privacy Extension (RFC 4941), has 
   some problems, such as not generating a new Interface ID (IID) after 
   changing the router prefix. The RFC also gives no explanation as to 
   how to use CGA in its randomizing solution. The purpose of this 
   document is to address these issues and to update the current RFC.

INTERNET DRAFT         RA-base Privacy Extension             May 4, 2013



1.  Introduction 

   This document defines the meaning of privacy as it relates to methods 
   for maintaining our confidential data so that it does not become 
   available to or is exposed to unscrupulous people who would use it to 
   harm us or use it for their ill gains. There is currently only one 
   solution available in IPv6 autoconfiguration (RFC-4662), i.e., 
   Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. In the Privacy Extension document, two 
   different approaches are used for IID generation. In the first 
   approach, the use of stable storage enables it to find which IIDs are 
   used and which are reserved. In the second approach, where stable 
   storage is not available, it offers the use of either 
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] or Dynamic Host 
   Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6). The Privacy Extension document also 
   referred to the use of named approaches as a mechanism for greater 
   randomization. Here we offer an update to section 3.2.2 of RFC 4941 
   in order to explain how to use CGA when security is not the issue. 
   Another update to this RFC will be how to maintain the lifetime of 
   the IP address when the router prefix changes. This is because, in 
   this RFC, the key role is the lifetime of the IID, and it might not 
   expire when the router prefix is changed. This means that the node 
   might not change its IID when it moves to another network unless it 
   is rebooted. This might give an attacker the ability to track this 
   node, and obtain enough confidential information about this node, to 
   allow for further attacks. 



2.  Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation 
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be 
   interpreted as carrying RFC 2119 significance. 

   In this document the use of || indicates the concatenation of the 
   values on either side of the sign. 



3.  Algorithms Overview 

   This section explains how to use the modified version of the CGA 
   algorithm for the randomization of the IID. This approach is 
   RECOMMENDED and preferable than the first approach where need stable 
   storage. 

   1. Generate a 16 byte random number called modifier. To generate this

INTERNET DRAFT         RA-base Privacy Extension             May 4, 2013

   modifier implementations SHOULD use a random seed to aid in the 
   randomization of this number. 

   2. Obtain Router prefix from the router advertisement 

   3. Obtain the nodes' current time and convert it to timestamp. The 
   timestamp is a 64-bit unsigned integer field containing a timestamp. 
   The value indicates the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 
   00:00 UTC, by using a fixed point format. 

   4. Concatenate the modifier to the timestamp and router prefix. 

   R1=(modifier(16 bytes)||timestamp(8 bytes)|| router prefix) 

   5. Execute SHA2 (256) on the result from step 4. 

   digest=SHA256(R1) 

   The use of SHA2 (256) is RECOMMENDED because the chances of finding a 
   collision are less than when using SHA1 and the generation time is 
   acceptable (in microseconds using a standard CPU). If, in the future, 
   a faster and collision free algorithm becomes available, then it 
   SHOULD be used. It is RECOMMENDED that the implementation be able to 
   support any new algorithms. 

   6. Take the 64 leftmost bits from the resulting output from step 5 
   (SHA2 digest) and set bits u and g (bits 7 and 8) to zero and call 
   this the IID. 

   7. Concatenate the IID to the local subnet prefix in order to set the 
   local IP address. If the lifetime of the old local address has not 
   expired, then the node MIGHT skip this step. Otherwise it will 
   receive a new router prefix. 

   8. Concatenate the IID to the router subnet prefix (Global subnet 
   prefix), obtained from the RA message, and set it as a tentative 
   global IP address. This IP address will become permanent after 
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) processing. This is another update 
   to RFC 4941. The status of IP addresses in RFC 4941 are temporary 
   while it SHOULD be permanent with a life time explained in section 4. 



3.1.  DAD Process 

   After the DAD process, if the node finds collisions in the network 
   then the modifier will be incremented and the DAD process will be 
   repeated. If after 3 times, it receives the same result, it will 
   consider this an attack and will start using that IP address. 



4.  Lifetime of Interface ID (IID)

   One of the problems with the Privacy Extension document as explained 
   earlier is that the IID might not change when the node joins new 
   network or receives a new router prefix. Here we update this 
   document. The router prefix has a higher priority than the IID's 
   current lifetime. This means that if the node receives new router 
   prefix while its current IID is still valid, it MUST generate new 
   randomized IID and start using it. It should not start any new 
   sessions with the old IID, but it MIGHT keep the current sessions as 
   what is explained in the Privacy Extension document. The IIDs MUST 
   only be valid for a short period of time which will depend on the 
   network policy in vogue. Any implementations SHOULD provide a means 
   of allowing for users to change the lifetime default value. 



4.1.  Automate the process for setting the lifetime 

   The implementations MIGHT consider an option where the RA messages 
   update the lifetime of all addresses generated when using this 
   approach when processing RA messages. This will eliminate the need 
   for the manual step during installation which sets the default value 
   of lifetime for any future IIDs generated using this approach based 
   on network policy. The format for this lifetime value will be the 
   same as that explained in section 5.3.1 RFC 3971. In this lifetime 
   option the type for SHOULD be set to next sequential number available 
   in the SeND options, i.e., 15. This field SHOULD be added to the 
   ICMPv6 option of RA messages. 

5.  Security Considerations

   As is explained in the Privacy Extension document. the same 
   approaches are used to maintain security, such as using Secure 
   Neighbor Discovery (SeND)(RFC-3971) or using a monitoring system 
   which would inform the administrator of the status of the network and 
   of any suspended activities in the network. 



6.  IANA Considerations

7.  Conclusions

   Privacy has become a very important issue in recent years. There is 
   one solution to the privacy issues, but the current solution has some 
   deficiencies. The purpose of the current document is to address and 
   solve the problem which exists with the Privacy Extension document 
   [RFC4941].
