                         Multipath RTP (MPRTP)
                      draft-singh-avtcore-mprtp-05

Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to deliver real-time
   content and, along with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), forms the
   control channel between the sender and receiver.  However, RTP and
   RTCP assume a single delivery path between the sender and receiver
   and make decisions based on the measured characteristics of this
   single path.  Increasingly, endpoints are becoming multi-homed, which
   means that they are connected via multiple Internet paths.  Network
   utilization can be improved when endpoints use multiple parallel
   paths for communication.  The resulting increase in reliability and
   throughput can also enhance the user experience.  This document
   extends the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) so that a single
   session can take advantage of the availability of multiple paths
   between two endpoints.

Internet-Draft                Multipath RTP                    July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Multi-homed endpoints are becoming common in today's Internet, e.g.,
   devices that support multiple wireless access technologies such as 3G
   and Wireless LAN.  This means that there is often more than one
   network path available between two endpoints.  Transport protocols,
   such as RTP, have not been designed to take advantage of the
   availability of multiple concurrent paths and therefore cannot
   benefit from the increased capacity and reliability that can be
   achieved by pooling their respective capacities.

   Multipath RTP (MPRTP) is an OPTIONAL extension to RTP [1] that allows
   splitting a single RTP stream into multiple subflows that are
   transmitted over different paths.  In effect, this pools the resource
   capacity of multiple paths.  Multipath RTCP (MPRTCP) is an extension
   to RTCP, it is used along with MPRTP to report per-path sender and
   receiver characteristics.

   Other IETF transport protocols that are capable of using multiple
   paths include SCTP [11], MPTCP [12] and SHIM6 [13].  However, these
   protocols are not suitable for real-time communications.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].

1.2.  Terminology

   o  Endpoint: host either initiating or terminating an RTP flow.

   o  Interface: logical or physical component that is capable of
      acquiring a unique IP address.

   o  Path: sequence of links between a sender and a receiver.
      Typically, defined by a set of source and destination addresses.

   o  Subflow: flow of RTP packets along a specific path, i.e., a subset
      of the packets belonging to an RTP stream.  The combination of all
      RTP subflows forms the complete RTP stream.  Typically, a subflow
      would map to a unique path, i.e., each combination of IP addresses
      and port pairs (5-tuple, including protocol) is a unique subflow.

1.3.  Use-cases

   The primary use-case for MPRTP is transporting high bit-rate
   streaming multimedia content between endpoints, where at least one is
   multi-homed.  Such endpoints could be residential IPTV devices that
   connect to the Internet through two different Internet service
   providers (ISPs), or mobile devices that connect to the Internet
   through 3G and WLAN interfaces.  By allowing RTP to use multiple
   paths for transmission, the following gains can be achieved:

   o  Higher quality: Pooling the resource capacity of multiple Internet
      paths allows higher bit-rate and higher quality codecs to be used.
      From the application perspective, the available bandwidth between
      the two endpoints increases.

   o  Load balancing: Transmitting an RTP stream over multiple paths
      reduces the bandwidth usage on a single path, which in turn
      reduces the impact of the media stream on other traffic on that
      path.

   o  Fault tolerance: When multiple paths are used in conjunction with
      redundancy mechanisms (FEC, re-transmissions, etc.), outages on
      one path have less impact on the overall perceived quality of the
      stream.

   A secondary use-case for MPRTP is transporting Voice over IP (VoIP)
   calls to a device with multiple interfaces.  Again, such an endpoint
   could be a mobile device with multiple wireless interfaces.  In this
   case, little is to be gained from resource pooling, i.e., higher
   capacity or load balancing, because a single path should be easily
   capable of handling the required load.  However, using multiple
   concurrent subflows can improve fault tolerance, because traffic can
   shift between the subflows when path outages occur.  This results in
   very fast transport-layer handovers that do not require support from
   signaling.


2.  Goals

   This section outlines the basic goals that multipath RTP aims to
   meet.  These are broadly classified as Functional goals and
   Compatibility goals.

2.1.  Functional goals

   Allow unicast RTP session to be split into multiple subflows in order
   to be carried over multiple paths.  This may prove beneficial in case
   of video streaming.



Singh, et al.           Expires January 11, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                Multipath RTP                    July 2012


   o  Increased Throughput: Cumulative capacity of the two paths may
      meet the requirements of the multimedia session.  Therefore, MPRTP
      MUST support concurrent use of the multiple paths.

   o  Improved Reliability: MPRTP SHOULD be able to send redundant
      packets or re-transmit packets along any available path to
      increase reliability.

   The protocol SHOULD be able to open new subflows for an existing
   session when new paths appear and MUST be able to close subflows when
   paths disappear.

2.2.  Compatibility goals

   MPRTP MUST be backwards compatible; an MPRTP stream needs to fall
   back to be compatible with legacy RTP stacks if MPRTP support is not
   successfully negotiated.

   o  Application Compatibility: MPRTP service model MUST be backwards
      compatible with existing RTP applications, i.e., an MPRTP stack
      MUST be able to work with legacy RTP applications and not require
      changes to them.  Therefore, the basic RTP APIs MUST remain
      unchanged, but an MPRTP stack MAY provide extended APIs so that
      the application can configure any additional features provided by
      the MPRTP stack.

   o  Network Compatibility: individual RTP subflows MUST themselves be
      well-formed RTP flows, so that they are able to traverse NATs and
      firewalls.  This MUST be the case even when interfaces appear
      after session initiation.  Interactive Connectivity Establishment
      (ICE) [3] MAY be used for discovering new interfaces or performing
      connectivity checks.


3.  RTP Topologies

   RFC 5117 [14] describes a number of scenarios using mixers and
   translators in single-party (point-to-point), and multi-party (point-
   to-multipoint) scenarios.  RFC 3550 [1] (Section 2.3 and 7.x) discuss
   in detail the impact of mixers and translators on RTP and RTCP
   packets.  MPRTP assumes that if a mixer or translator exists in the
   network, then either all of the multiple paths or none of the
   multiple paths go via this component.


4.  MPRTP Architecture

   In a typical scenario, an RTP session uses a single path.  In an

   MPRTP scenario, an RTP session uses multiple subflows that each use a
   different path.  Figure 1 shows the difference.

                       Figure 2: MPRTP Architecture

   Figure 2 illustrates the differences between the standard RTP stack
   and the MPRTP stack.  MPRTP receives a normal RTP session from the
   application and splits it into multiple RTP subflows.  Each subflow
   is then sent along a different path to the receiver.  To the network,
   each subflow appears as an independent, well-formed RTP flow.  At the
   receiver, the subflows are combined to recreate the original RTP
   session.  The MPRTP layer performs the following functions:

   o  Path Management: The layer is aware of alternate paths to the
      other host, which may, for example, be the peer's multiple
      interfaces.  This enables the endpoint to transmit differently
      marked packets along separate paths.  MPRTP also selects
      interfaces to send and receive data.  Furthermore, it manages the
      port and IP address pair bindings for each subflow.

Internet-Draft                Multipath RTP                    July 2012


   o  Packet Scheduling: the layer splits a single RTP flow into
      multiple subflows and sends them across multiple interfaces
      (paths).  The splitting MAY BE done using different path
      characteristics.

   o  Subflow recombination: the layer creates the original stream by
      recombining the independent subflows.  Therefore, the multipath
      subflows appear as a single RTP stream to applications.


5.  Example Media Flow Diagrams

   There may be many complex technical scenarios for MPRTP, however,
   this memo only considers the following two scenarios: 1) a
   unidirectional media flow that represents the streaming use-case, and
   2) a bidirectional media flow that represents a conversational use-
   case.

5.1.  Streaming use-case

   In the unidirectional scenario, the receiver (client) initiates a
   multimedia session with the sender (server).  The receiver or the
   sender may have multiple interfaces and both endpoints are MPRTP-
   capable.  Figure 3 shows this scenario.  In this case, host A has
   multiple interfaces.  Host B performs connectivity checks on host A's
   multiple interfaces.  If the interfaces are reachable, then host B
   streams multimedia data along multiple paths to host A. Moreover,
   host B also sends RTCP Sender Reports (SR) for each subflow and host
   A responds with a normal RTCP Receiver Report (RR) for the overall
   session as well as the receiver statistics for each subflow.  Host B
   distributes the packets across the subflows based on the individually
   measured path characteristics.

   Alternatively, to reduce media startup time, host B may start
   streaming multimedia data to host A's initiating interface and then
   perform connectivity checks for the other interfaces.  This method of
   updating a single path session to a multipath session is called
   "multipath session upgrade".

5.2.  Conversational use-case

   In the bidirectional scenario, multimedia data flows in both
   directions.  The two hosts exchange their lists of interfaces with
   each other and perform connectivity checks.  Communication begins
   after each host finds suitable address, port pairs.  Interfaces that
   receive data send back RTCP receiver statistics for that path (based
   on the 5-tuple).  The hosts balance their multimedia stream across
   multiple paths based on the per path reception statistics and its own
   volume of traffic.  Figure 4 describes an example of a bidirectional
   flow.

6.  MPRTP Functional Blocks

   This section describes some of the functional blocks needed for
   MPRTP.  We then investigate each block and consider available
   mechanisms in the next section.

   1.  Session Setup: Interfaces may appear or disappear at anytime
       during the session.  To preserve backward compatibility with
       legacy applications, a multipath session MUST look like a bundle
       of individual RTP sessions.  A multipath session may be upgraded
       from a typical single path session, as and when new interfaces
       appear or disappear.  However, it is also possible to setup a
       multipath session from the beginning, if the interfaces are
       available at the start of the multimedia session.

   2.  Expanding RTP: For a multipath session, each subflow MUST look
       like an independent RTP flow, so that individual RTCP messages
       can be generated per subflow.  Furthermore, MPRTP splits the
       single multimedia stream into multiple subflows based on path
       characteristics (e.g.  RTT, loss-rate, receiver rate, bandwidth-
       delay product etc.) and dynamically adjusts the load on each
       link.

   3.  Adding Interfaces: Interfaces on the host need to be regularly
       discovered and advertised.  This can be done at session setup
       and/or during the session.  Discovering interfaces is outside the
       scope of this document.

   4.  Expanding RTCP: MPRTP MUST provide per path RTCP reports for
       monitoring the quality of the path, for load balancing, or for
       congestion control, etc.  To maintain backward compatibility with
       legacy applications, the receiver MUST also send aggregate RTCP
       reports along with the per-path reports.

   5.  Maintenance and Failure Handling: In a multi-homed endpoint
       interfaces may appear and disappear.  If this occurs at the
       sender, it has to re-adjust the load on the available links.  On
       the other hand, if this occurs at the receiver, then the
       multimedia data transmitted by the sender to those interfaces is
       lost.  This data may be re-transmitted along a different path
       i.e., to a different interface on the receiver.  Furthermore, the
       endpoint has to either explicitly signal the disappearance of an
       interface, or the other endpoint has to detect it (by lack of
       media packets, RTCP feedback, or keep-alive packets).

   6.  Teardown: The MPRTP layer releases the occupied ports on the
       interfaces.


7.  Available Mechanisms within the Functional Blocks

   This section discusses some of the possible alternatives for each
   functional block mentioned in the previous section.

7.1.  Session Setup

   MPRTP session can be set up in many possible ways e.g., during
   handshake, or upgraded mid-session.  The capability exchange may be
   done using out-of-band signaling (e.g., Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [15] in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [16], Real-Time
   Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [17]) or in-band signaling (e.g., RTP/RTCP
   header extension, Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)
   messages).

7.1.1.  Connectivity Checks

   The endpoint SHOULD be capable of performing connectivity checks
   (e.g., using ICE [3]).  If the IP addresses of the endpoints are
   reachable (e.g., globally addressable, same network etc) then
   connectivity checks are not needed.

7.1.2.  Adding New or Updating Interfaces

   Interfaces can appear and disappear during a session, the endpoint
   MUST be capable of advertising the changes in its set of usable
   interfaces.  Additionally, the application or OS may define a policy
   on when and/or what interfaces are usable.  However, MPRTP requires a
   method to advertise or notify the other endpoint about the updated
   set of usable interfaces.

7.1.3.  In-band vs. Out-of-band Signaling

   MTRTP nodes will generally use a signaling protocol to establish
   their MPRTP session.  With the existence of such a signaling
   relationship, two alternatives become available to exchange
   information about the available interfaces on each side for extending
   RTP sessions to MPRTP and for modifying MPRTP sessions: in-band and
   out-of-band signaling.

   In-band signaling refers to using mechanisms of RTP/RTCP itself to
   communicate interface addresses, e.g., a dedicated RTCP extensions
   along the lines of the one defined to communicate information about
   the feedback target for RTP over SSM [4].  In-band signaling does not



Singh, et al.           Expires January 11, 2013               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                Multipath RTP                    July 2012


   rely on the availability of a separate signaling connection and the
   information flows along the same path as the media streams, thus
   minimizing dependencies.  Moreover, if the media channel is secured
   (e.g., by means of SRTP), the signaling is implicitly protected as
   well if SRTCP encryption and authentication are chosen.  In-band
   signaling is also expected to take a direct path to the peer,
   avoiding any signaling overlay-induced indirections and associated
   processing overheads in signaling elements -- avoiding such may be
   especially worthwhile if frequent updates may occur as in the case of
   mobile users.  Finally, RTCP is usually sent sufficiently frequently
   (in point-to-point settings) to provide enough opportunities for
   transmission and (in case of loss) retransmission of the
   corresponding RTCP packets.

   Examples for in-band signaling include RTCP extensions as noted above
   or suitable extensions to STUN.

   Out-of-band signaling refers to using a separate signaling connection
   (via SIP, RTSP, or HTTP) to exchange interface information, e.g.,
   expressed in SDP.  Clear benefits are that signaling occurs at setup
   time anyway and that experience and SDP syntax (and procedures) are
   available that can be re-used or easily adapted to provide the
   necessary capabilities.  In contrast to RTCP, SDP offers a reliable
   communication channel so that no separate retransmissions logic is
   necessary.  In SDP, especially when combined with ICE, connectivity
   check mechanisms including sophisticated rules are readily available.
   While SDP is not inherently protected, suitable security may need to
   be applied anyway to the basic session setup.

   Examples for out-of-band signaling are dedicated extensions to SDP;
   those may be combined with ICE.

   Both types of mechanisms have their pros and cons for middleboxes.
   With in-band signaling, control packets take the same path as the
   media packets and they can be directly inspected by middleboxes so
   that the elements operating on the signaling channel do not need to
   understand new SDP.  With out-of-band signaling, only the middleboxes
   processing the signaling need to be modified and those on the data
   forwarding path can remain untouched.

   Overall, it may appear sensible to provide a combination of both
   mechanisms: out-of-band signaling for session setup and initial
   interface negotiation and in-band signaling to deal with frequent
   changes in interface state (and for the potential case, albeit rather
   theoretical case of MPRTP communication without a signaling channel).

   In its present version, this document explores both options to
   provide a broad understanding of how the corresponding mechanisms

   would look like.

   [[Comment.1: Some have suggested STUN may be suitable for doing in-
   band interface advertisement.  This is still under consideration, but
   depends on implementation challenges as many legacy systems don't
   implement STUN and many RTP systems ignore STUN messages. --Editor]]

7.2.  Expanding RTP

   RTCP [1] is generated per media session.  However, with MPRTP, the
   media sender spreads the RTP load across several interfaces.  The
   media sender SHOULD make the path selection, load balancing and fault
   tolerance decisions based on the characteristics of each path.
   Therefore, apart from normal RTP sequence numbers defined in [1], the
   MPRTP sender MUST add subflow-specific sequence numbers to help
   calculate fractional losses, jitter, RTT, playout time, etc., for
   each path, and a subflow identifier to associate the characteristics
   with a path.  The RTP header extension for MPRTP is shown in
   Section 9.1.

7.3.  Expanding RTCP

   To provide accurate per path information an MPRTP endpoint MUST send
   (SR/RR) report for each unique subflow along with the overall session
   RTCP report.  Therefore, the additional subflow reporting affects the
   RTCP bandwidth and the RTCP reporting interval.  RTCP report
   scheduling for each subflow may cause a problem for RTCP
   recombination and reconstruction in cases when 1) RTCP for a subflow
   is lost, and 2) RTCP for a subflow arrives later than the other
   subflows.  (There may be other cases as well.)

   The sender distributes the media across different paths using the per
   path RTCP reports.  However, this document doesn't cover algorithms
   for congestion control or load balancing.

7.4.  Failure Handling and Teardown

   An MPRTP endpoint MUST keep alive subflows that have been negotiated
   but no media is sent on them.  Moreover, using the information in the
   subflow reports, a sender can monitor an active subflow for failure
   (errors, unreachability, congestion) and decide not to use (make the
   active subflow passive), or teardown the subflow.

   If an interface disappears, the endpoint MUST send an updated
   interface advertisement without the interface and release the the
   associated subflows.

8.1.  Overview

   The bullet points explain the different steps shown in Figure 5 for
   upgrading a single path multimedia session to multipath session.

      (1) The first two interactions between the hosts represents the
      establishment of a normal RTP session.  This may performed e.g.
      using SIP or RTSP.

      (2) When the RTP session has been established, host B streams
      media using its interface B1 to host A at interface A1.

      (3) Host B supports sending media using MPRTP and becomes aware of
      an additional interface B2.




Singh, et al.           Expires January 11, 2013               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                Multipath RTP                    July 2012


      (4) Host B advertises the multiple interface addresses.

      (5) Host A supports receiving media using MPRTP and becomes aware
      of an additional interface A2.

      Side note, even if an MPRTP-capable host has only one interface,
      it MUST respond to the advertisement with its single interface.

      (6) Each host receives information about the additional interfaces
      and the appropriate endpoints starts to stream the multimedia
      content using the additional paths.

      If needed, each endpoint will need to independently perform
      connectivity checks (not shown in figure) and ascertain
      reachability before using the paths.

8.1.1.  Gather or Discovering Candidates

   The endpoint periodically polls the operating system or is notified
   when an additional interface appears.  If the endpoint wants to use
   the additional interface for MPRTP it MUST advertise it to the other
   peers.  The endpoint may also use ICE [3] to gather additional
   candidates.

8.1.2.  NAT Traversal

   After gathering their interface candidates, the endpoints decide
   internally if they wish to perform connectivity checks.

   [[Comment.2: Legacy applications do not require ICE for session
   establishment, therefore, MPRTP should not require it as well.
   --Editor]]

   If the endpoint chooses to perform connectivity checks then it MUST
   first advertise the gathered candidates as ICE candidates in SDP
   during session setup and let ICE perform the connectivity checks.  As
   soon as a sufficient number of connectivity checks succeed, the
   endpoint can use the successful candidates to advertise its MPRTP
   interface candidates.

8.1.3.  Choosing between In-band (in RTCP) and Out-of-band  (in SDP)
        Interface Advertisement

   If there is no media flowing at the moment and the application wants
   to use the interfaces from the start of the session, it should
   advertise them in SDP (See [5]).  Alternatively, the endpoint can
   setup the session as a single path media session and upgrade the
   session to multipath by advertising the session in-band (See



Singh, et al.           Expires January 11, 2013               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                Multipath RTP                    July 2012


   Section 8.1.4).  Moreover, if an interface appears and disappears,
   the endpoint SHOULD prefer to advertise it in-band because the
   endpoint would not have to wait for a response from the other
   endpoint before starting to use the interface.  However, if there is
   a conflict between an in-band and out-of-band advertisement, i.e.,
   the endpoint receives an in-band advertisement while it has a pending
   out-of-band advertisement, or vice versa then the session is setup
   using out-of-band mechanisms.

8.1.4.  In-band Interface Advertisement

   To advertise the multiple interfaces in RTCP, an MPRTP-capable
   endpoint MUST add the MPRTP Interface Advertisement defined in
   Figure 13 with the RTCP Sender Report (SR).  Each unique address is
   encapsulated in an Interface Advertisement block and contains the IP
   address, RTP and RTCP port addresses.  The Interface Advertisement
   blocks are ordered based on a decreasing priority level.  On
   receiving the MPRTP Interface Advertisement, an MPRTP-capable
   receiver MUST respond with the set of interfaces (subset or all
   available) it wants to use.

   If the sender and receiver have only one interface, then the
   endpoints MUST indicate the negotiated single path IP, RTP port and
   RTCP port addresses.

8.1.5.  Subflow ID Assignment

   After interface advertisements have been exchanged, the endpoint MUST
   associate a Subflow ID to each unique subflow.  Each combination of
   sender and receiver IP addresses and port pairs (5-tuple) is a unique
   subflow.  If the connectivity checks have been performed then the
   endpoint MUST only use the subflows for which the connectivity checks
   have succeeded.

8.1.6.  Active and Passive Subflows

   To send and receive data an endpoint MAY use any number of subflows
   from the set of available subflows.  The subflows that carry media
   data are called active subflows, while those subflows that don't send
   any media packets (fallback paths) are called passive subflows.

   An endpoint MUST multiplex the subflow specific RTP and RTCP packets
   on the same port to keep the NAT bindings alive.  This is inline with
   the recommendation made in RFC6263[18].  Moreover, if an endpoint
   uses ICE, multiplexing RTP and RTCP reduces the number of components
   from 2 to 1 per media stream.  If no MPRTP or MPRTCP packets are
   received on a particular subflow at a receiver, the receiver SHOULD
   remove the subflow from active and passive lists and not send any



Singh, et al.           Expires January 11, 2013               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                Multipath RTP                    July 2012


   MPRTCP reports for that subflow.  It may keep the bindings in a dead-
   pool, so that if the 5-tuple or subflow reappears, it can quickly
   reallocate it based on past history.

8.2.  RTP Transmission

   If both endpoints are MPRTP-capable and if they want to use their
   multiple interfaces for sending the media stream then they MUST use
   the MPRTP header extensions.  They MAY use normal RTP with legacy
   endpoints (see Appendix A).

   An MPRTP endpoint sends RTP packets with an MPRTP extension that maps
   the media packet to a specific subflow (see Figure 8).  The MPRTP
   layer SHOULD associate an RTP packet with a subflow based on a
   scheduling strategy.  The scheduling strategy may either choose to
   augment the paths to create higher throughput or use the alternate
   paths for enhancing resilience or error-repair.  Due to the changes
   in path characteristics, the endpoint should be able change its
   scheduling strategy during an ongoing session.  The MPRTP sender MUST
   also populate the subflow specific fields described in the MPRTP
   extension header (see Section 9.1.1).

8.3.  Playout Considerations at the Receiver

   A media receiver, irrespective of MPRTP support or not, should be
   able to playback the media stream because the received RTP packets
   are compliant to [1], i.e., a non-MPRTP receiver will ignore the
   MPRTP header and still be able to playback the RTP packets.  However,
   the variation of jitter and loss per path may affect proper playout.
   The receiver can compensate for the jitter by modifying the playout
   delay (i.e., by calculating skew across all paths) of the received
   RTP packets.

8.4.  Subflow-specific RTCP Statistics and RTCP Aggregation

   Aggregate RTCP provides the overall media statistics and follows the
   normal RTCP defined in RFC3550 [1].  However, subflow specific RTCP
   provides the per path media statistics because the aggregate RTCP
   report may not provide sufficient per path information to an MPRTP
   scheduler.  Specifically, the scheduler should be aware of each
   path's RTT and loss-rate, which an aggregate RTCP cannot provide.
   The sender/receiver MUST use non-compound RTCP reports defined in
   RFC5506 [6] to transmit the aggregate and subflow-specific RTCP
   reports.  Also, each subflow and the aggregate RTCP report MUST
   follow the timing rules defined in [7].

   The RTCP reporting interval is locally implemented and the scheduling
   of the RTCP reports may depend on the the behavior of each path.  For



Singh, et al.           Expires January 11, 2013               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                Multipath RTP                    July 2012


   instance, the RTCP interval may be different for a passive path than
   an active path to keep port bindings alive.  Additionally, an
   endpoint may decide to share the RTCP reporting bit rate equally
   across all its paths or schedule based on the receiver rate on each
   path.

8.5.  RTCP Transmission

   The sender sends an RTCP SR on each active path.  For each SR the
   receiver gets, it echoes one back to the same IP address-port pair
   that sent the SR.  The receiver tries to choose the symmetric path
   and if the routing is symmetric then the per-path RTT calculations
   will work out correctly.  However, even if the paths are not
   symmetric, the sender would at maximum, under-estimate the RTT of the
   path by a factor of half of the actual path RTT.


9.  Packet Formats

   In this section we define the protocol structures described in the
   previous sections.

9.1.  RTP Header Extension for MPRTP

   The MPRTP header extension is used to distribute a single RTP stream
   over multiple subflows.

   The header conforms to the one-byte RTP header extension defined in
   [8].  The header extension contains a 16-bit length field that counts
   the number of 32-bit words in the extension, excluding the four-octet
   extension header (therefore zero is a valid length, see Section 5.3.1
   of [1] for details).

   The RTP header for each subflow is defined below:

         Indicates that the MPRTP header extension carries subflow
         specific information.

      length = 4

      Subflow ID: Identifier of the subflow.  Every RTP packet belonging
      to the same subflow carries the same unique subflow identifier.

      Flow-Specific Sequence Number (FSSN): Sequence of the packet in
      the subflow.  Each subflow has its own strictly monotonically
      increasing sequence number space.

9.2.  RTCP Extension for MPRTP (MPRTCP)

   The MPRTP RTCP header extension is used to 1) provide RTCP feedback
   per subflow to determine the characteristics of each path, and 2)
   advertise each interface.

      MPRTCP_Type and length fields.

   Subflow ID: 16 bits

      Subflow identifier is the value associated with the subflow the
      endpoint is reporting about.  If it is a sender it MUST use the
      Subflow ID associated with the 5-tuple.  If it is a receiver it
      MUST use the Subflow ID received in the Subflow-specific Sender
      Report.

   Subflow-specific reports: variable

      Subflow-specific report contains all the reports associated with
      the Subflow ID.  For a sender, it MUST include the Subflow-
      specific Sender Report (SSR).  For a receiver, it MUST include
      Subflow-specific Receiver Report (SRR).  Additionally, if the
      receiver supports subflow-specific extension reports then it MUST
      append them to the SRR.

9.3.  MPRTCP Extension for Interface advertisement

   This sub-section defines the RTCP header extension for in-band
   interface advertisement by the receiver.  The interface advertisement
   block describes a method to represent IPv4, IPv6 and generic DNS-type
   addresses in a block format.  It is based on the sub-reporting block
   in [4].  The interface advertisement SHOULD immediately follow the
   Receiver Report.  If the Receiver Report is not present, then it MUST
   be appended to the Sender Report.

   The endpoint MUST advertise the interfaces it wants to use whenever
   an interface appears or disappears and also when it receives an
   Interface Advertisement.

      MPRTCP_Type: 8 bits

         The MPRTCP_Type corresponds to the type of interface address.
         Namely:

            1: IPv4 address

            2: IPv6 address

            3: DNS name

      block length: 8 bits

         The length of the Interface Advertisement block in bytes.

            For an IPv4 address, this should be 9 (i.e., 5 octets for
            the header and 4 octets for IPv4 address).

            For an IPv6 address, this should be 21.

            For a DNS name, the length field indicates the number of
            octets making up the string plus the 5 byte header.

      RTP Port: 2 octets

         The port number to which the sender sends RTP data.  A port
         number of 0 is invalid and MUST NOT be used.

      Interface Address: 4 octets (IPv4), 16 octets (IPv6), or n octets
      (DNS name)

         The address to which receivers send feedback reports.  For IPv4
         and IPv6, fixed-length address fields are used.  A DNS name is
         an arbitrary-length string.  The string MAY contain
         Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) domain
         names and MUST be UTF-8 [9] encoded.


10.  RTCP Timing reconsiderations for MPRTCP

   MPRTP endpoints MUST conform to the timing rule imposed in [7], i.e.,
   the total RTCP rate between the participants MUST NOT exceed 5% of
   the media rate.  For each endpoint, a subflow MUST send the aggregate
   and subflow-specific report.  The endpoint SHOULD schedule the RTCP
   reports for the active subflows based on the share of the transmitted
   or received bit rate to the average media bit rate, this method
   ensures fair sharing of the RTCP bandwidth.  Alternatively, the
   endpoint MAY schedule the reports in round-robin.


11.  SDP Considerations

11.1.  Signaling MPRTP Header Extension in SDP

   To indicate the use of the MPRTP header extensions (see Section 9) in
   SDP, the sender MUST use the following URI in extmap:
   urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:mprtp.  This is a media level parameter.
   Legacy RTP (non-MPRTP) clients will ignore this header extension, but
   can continue to parse and decode the packet (see Appendix A).

   Example:

   v=0
   o=alice 2890844526 2890844527 IN IP4 192.0.2.1
   s=
   c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
   t=0 0
   m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 98
   a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
   a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42A01E;
   a=extmap:1 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:mprtp

11.2.  Signaling MPRTP capability in SDP

   A participant of a media session MUST use SDP to indicate that it
   supports MPRTP.  Not providing this information will make the other
   endpoint ignore the RTCP extensions.

       mprtp-attrib = "a=" "mprtp" [
               SP mprtp-optional-parameter]
               CRLF   ; flag to enable MPRTP

   The endpoint MUST use 'a=mprtp', if it is able to send and receive
   MPRTP packets.  Generally, senders and receivers MUST indicate this
   capability if they support MPRTP and would like to use it in the
   specific media session being signaled.  To exchange the additional
   interfaces, the endpoint SHOULD use the in-band signaling (See
   Section 9.3).  Alternatively, advertise in SDP (See [5]).

   MPRTP endpoint multiplexes RTP and RTCP on a single port, sender MUST
   indicate support by adding "a=rtcp-mux" in SDP [10].  If an endpoint
   receives an SDP without "a=rtcp-mux" but contains "a=mprtp", then the
   endpoint MUST infer support for multiplexing.

   [[Comment.4: If a=mprtp is indicated, does the endpoint need to
   indicate a=rtcp-mux? because MPRTP mandates RTP RTCP multiplexing.

11.3.  MPRTP with ICE

   If the endpoints intend to use ICE [3] for discovering interfaces and
   running connectivity checks then the endpoint MUST advertise its ICE
   candidates in the initial OFFER, as defined in ICE [3].  Thereafter
   the endpoints run connectivity checks.

   When an endpoint uses ICE's regular nomination [3] procedure, it
   chooses the best ICE candidate as the default path.  In the case of
   an MPRTP endpoint, if more than one ICE candidate succeeded the
   connectivity checks then an MPRTP endpoint MAY advertise (some of)
   these in-band in RTCP as MPRTP interfaces.

   When an endpoint uses ICE's aggressive nomination [3] procedure, the
   selected candidate may change as more ICE checks complete.  Instead
   of sending updated offers as additional ICE candidates appear
   (transience), the endpoint it MAY use in-band signaling to advertise
   its interfaces, as defined in Section 9.3.

   If the default interface disappears and the paths used for MPRTP are
   different from the one in the c= and m= lines then the an alternate
   interface for which the ICE checks were successful should be promoted
   to the c= and m= lines in the updated offer.

   When a new interface appears then the application/endpoint should
   internally decide if it wishes to use it and sends an updated offer
   with ICE candidates of the all its interfaces including the new
   interface.  The receiving endpoint responds to the offer with all its
   ICE candidates in the answer and starts connectivity checks between
   all its candidates and the offerer's ICE candidates.  Similarly, the
   initiating endpoint starts connectivity checks between the its
   interfaces (incl. the new interface) and all the received ICE
   candidates in the answer.  If the connectivity checks succeed, the
   initiating endpoint MAY use in-band signaling (See Section 9.3) to
   advertise its new set of interfaces.

11.4.  Increased Throughput

   The MPRTP layer MAY choose to augment paths to increase throughput.
   If the desired media rate exceeds the current media rate, the
   endpoints MUST renegotiate the application specific ("b=AS:xxx") [19]
   bandwidth.

11.5.  Offer/Answer

   When SDP [19] is used to negotiate MPRTP sessions following the
   offer/answer model [15], the "a=mprtp" attribute (see Section 11.2)
   indicates the desire to use multiple interfaces to send or receive



Singh, et al.           Expires January 11, 2013               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft                Multipath RTP                    July 2012


   media data.  The initial SDP offer MUST include this attribute at the
   media level.  If the answerer wishes to also use MPRTP, it MUST
   include a media-level "a=mprtp" attribute in the answer.  If the
   answer does not contain an "a=mprtp" attribute, the offerer MUST NOT
   stream media over multiple paths and the offerer MUST NOT advertise
   additional MPRTP interfaces in-band or out-of-band.

   When SDP is used in a declarative manner, the presence of an
   "a=mprtp" attribute signals that the sender can send or receive media
   data over multiple interfaces.  The receiver SHOULD be capable to
   stream media to the multiple interfaces and be prepared to receive
   media from multiple interfaces.

   The following sections shows examples of SDP offer and answer for in-
   band and out-of-band signaling.

11.5.1.  In-band Signaling Example

   The following offer/answer shows that both the endpoints are MPRTP
   capable and SHOULD use in-band signaling for interfaces
   advertisements.

     t=0 0
     m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 98
     a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
     a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42A01E;
     a=rtcp-mux
     a=mprtp


   Answer:
     v=0
     o=bob 2890844528 2890844529 IN IP4 192.0.2.2

     a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42A01E;
     a=rtcp-mux
     a=mprtp

   The endpoint MAY now use in-band RTCP signaling to advertise its

Appendix A.  Interoperating with Legacy Applications

   An MPRTP sender can use its multiple interfaces to send media to a
   legacy RTP client.  The legacy receiver will ignore the subflow RTP
   header and the receiver's de-jitter buffer will try to compensate for
   the mismatch in per-path delay.  However, the receiver can only send
   the overall or aggregate RTCP report which may be insufficient for an
   MPRTP sender to adequately schedule packets or detect if a path
   disappeared.

   An MPRTP receiver can only use one of its interface when
   communicating with a legacy sender.
