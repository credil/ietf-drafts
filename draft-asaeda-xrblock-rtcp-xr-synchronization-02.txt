Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks             September 2011


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   This new block type supports reporting of Initial synchronization
   delay.  Information is recorded about the difference between the
   start of RTP sessions and the time the RTP receiver acquires all
   components of RTP sessions [RFC6051].  It also supports reporting of
   the general Synchronization offset status of an arbitrary number of
   streams, with the same RTCP CNAME.  Information is recorded about the
   synchronization offset time of each RTP stream relative to the
   reference RTP stream with the same CNAME and General Synchronization
   Offset of zero.

   The metrics belong to the class of transport level metrics defined in
   [MONARCH] (work in progress).


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   The report blocks defined in this document could be used by dedicated
   network monitoring applications.

   When joining each session in layered video sessions [RFC6190] or the
   multimedia sessions, a receiver may not synchronize playout across
   the multimedia sessions or layered video sessions until RTCP SR
   packets have been received on all the components of RTP sessions.
   The components of RTP sessions are referred to as each RTP stream for
   each media type in multimedia sessions or each RTP stream at each
   layer in the layered video sessions. .  For unicast session, the
   delay due to negotiation of NAT pinholes, firewall holes, quality-of-
   service, and media security keys is contributed to such initial
   synchronization playout.  For multicast session, such initial
   synchronization delay varies with the session bandwidth and the
   number of members, the number of senders in the session.  The RTP
   flow Initial synchronization delay block can be used to report the
   initial synchronization delay of these RTP streams beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  In the

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks             September 2011


   absence of packet loss, the initial synchronization delay equals to
   the average time taken to receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP
   session with the longest RTCP reporting interval.  In the presence of
   packet loss, the media synchronization needs to based on the in-band
   mapping of RTP and NTP- format timestamps [RFC6051] or wait until the
   reporting interval has passed, and the next RTCP SR packet is sent.

   In an RTP multimedia session, there can be an arbitrary number of
   streams, with the same RTCP CNAME.  The RTP Flows General
   Synchronization Offset block can be used to report the general
   Synchronization offset status of these RTP streams beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  In the
   multimedia session, the first RTP packet can be chosen as the basic
   packet of reference RTP stream.


4.  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block

   This block reports Initial synchronization delay beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  Information
   is recorded about the the difference between the start of RTP
   sessions and the time the RTP receiver acquires all components of RTP
   sessions [RFC6051].

4.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block has the
   following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     BT=TBD    |   Reserved    |          Block length         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      SSRC of Source                           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |               Initial Synchronization Delay                   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow Initial Synchronization Delay
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The Statistics Summary Report Block is identified by the constant
      <RFISD>.

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks             September 2011


   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the RTP data packet source being reported upon by this
      report block.  (Section 4.1 of [RFC3611]).

   Initial Synchronization Delay: 32 bits

      The average delay, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, between
      the RTCP packets received on all of the components RTP sessions
      and the beginning of session [RFC6051].  The value is calculated
      based on the information contained in RTCP SR packets or the in-
      band mapping of RTP and NTP- format timestamps [RFC6051].  If
      there is no packet loss, the initial synchronisation delay is
      expected to equal to the average time taken to receive the first
      RTCP packet in the RTP session with the longest RTCP reporting
      interval.


5.  RTP Flows General Synchronization Offset Metrics Block

   In the RTP multimedia sessions, there can be an arbitrary number of
   Streams and each type of media (e.g., audio or video) is sent in a
   separate RTP streams.  The receiver associates RTP streams to be
   synchronised by means of RTCP CNAME contained in the RTCP Source
   Description (SDES) packets [RFC3550].  This block reports the general
   Synchronization offset status of these RTP streams beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  Information
   is recorded about the synchronization offset time of each RTP stream
   relative to the reference RTP stream with the same CNAME and General
   Synchronisation Offset of zero.


5.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block has the
   following format:

5.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block is
      identified by the constant <RFGSO>.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 3, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the RTP data packet source being reported upon by this
      report block.  (Section 4.1 of [RFC3611]).

   General synchronization offset: 32 bits

      This field represents the synchronization offset time of one RTP
      stream in milliseconds relative to the reference RTP stream with
      the same CNAME and General Synchronisation Offset of zero
      [RFC6051] This value is calculated based on the interarrival time
      between arbitray RTP packet and the reference RTP packet with the
      same CNAME , and timestamps of this arbitray RTP packet and the
      reference RTP packet with the same CNAME.


6.  SDP Signaling

   Two new parameters are defined for the two report blocks defined in
   this document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].
   They have the following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute
   [RFC3611]:

        rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                          [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
              xr-format = RTP-flows-init-syn
                       / RTP-flows-general-syn

              RTP-flows-init-syn = "RTP-flows-init-syn"
                              ["=" max-size]
                 max-size = 1*DIGIT ; maximum block size in octets

              RTP-flow-general-syn = "RTP-flows-general-syn"
                                ["=" max-size]
                 max-size = 1*DIGIT ; maximum block size in octets

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


7.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns two new block type values in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:

      Name:       RFISD
      Long Name:  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay
      Value       <RFISD>
      Reference:  Section 4

      Name:       RFGSO
      Long Name:  RTP Flows General Synchronization Offset Metrics Block
      Value       <RFGSO>
      Reference:  Section 5


   This document also registers two new SDP [RFC4566] parameters for the
   "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:

      *  "RTP-flows-init-syn"
      *  "RTP-flows-general-syn"

   The contact information for the registrations is:
