                ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable due Sleep
           draft-savolainen-6man-icmp-destination-sleeping-00

Abstract

   A destination node may be unreachable due being in sleep mode that
   lasts longer than is feasible to buffer a packet in a network or at
   the last hop entity, such as a router of a link.  In such scenarios
   the originator of the packet can be better off knowing destination's
   sleep being the cause of destination unreachable ICMPv6 message
   emitted by the entity dropping the packet.  This document defines an
   ICMPv6 Code value for indicating Destination Unreachable due sleep.

1.  Introduction

   A destination node may be unreacable due being in a sleep mode that
   lasts longer than is feasible to buffer a packet, for example by a
   router of the last hop link.  In such cases the originator of the
   packet that was dropped could benefit from learning more precisely
   why the packet was dropped.

   The ICMPv6 [RFC4443] specify codes for indicating destination being
   unreachable for set of reasons.  This document introduces a new code
   value for indicating destination being at sleep.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  ICMPv6 Destination at Sleep

   When a node, such as a router, is unable to deliver an IPv6 packet to
   a destination while knowing the destination being at sleep, the node
   SHALL generate ICMPv6 type 1 Destination Unreachable message as
   defined in RFC 4443 [RFC4443] with code value TBD1 "Destination at
   Sleep".

   The destination at sleep code is more informative subset of code 3
   "Address unreachable".  The Code 3 is intended to be used when
   delivery failure cannot be mapped to other codes defined by RFC 4443,
   such as due "link-specific problem of some sort." (section 3.1 of RFC
   4443).  Implementations MAY handle the new code similarly to code 3,
   such as a link-specific problem, in case they do not implement logic
   specific for handling the destination at sleep error.

   I will ack.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requires IANA to allocate a new ICMPv6 [RFC4443] Code value
   for TBD1 under the ICMPv6 Type 1 Destination Unreachable.  This value
   is needed to indicate a destination being at sleep.  The Code values
   are registered in the ICMPv6 Parameters registry.  The value for
   "Code" can be the next one available, such as 8.

        Code      Name                    Reference
        --------  ----------------------  --------------------
        TBD1      Destination at sleep    [RFC this document]

   [TO BE REMOVED: This registration should take place at the following
   location: http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters/
   icmpv6-parameters.xml#icmpv6-parameters-codes-2 ]

5.  Security Considerations

   Similarly to the ICMPv6 destination port unreachable error, the
   destination at sleep error reveals existence of a node in a given
   IPv6 address, and hence can provide useful information for an
   attacker scanning for existing and connected nodes.  However, as the
   ICMPv6 error message with the new code is sent by other entity than
   the sleeping node itself, the sleeping node, or a host firewall, has
   no means for forbidding such messages to be sent.  Therefore, if a
   sleeping node's existence needs to be hidden, which naturally causes
   benefits of the new error code to be lost, a network firewall has to
   perform packet filtering.  In such case the network has to filter
   also ICMPv6 address unreachable messages in order for the attacker
   not being able to derive existence of a node from the lack of address
   unreachable error message.
