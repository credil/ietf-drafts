Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Network Address Translation
                    draft-ietf-behave-sctpnat-07.txt

Abstract

   Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
   communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
   TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
   Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
   that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a
   single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind a
   NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This
   additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port
   Translation or NAPT.  To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet
   been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The end
   result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a
   NAT.

   This document describes an SCTP specific variant of NAT which
   provides similar features of NAPT in the single point and multi-point
   traversal scenario.

Internet-Draft                  SCTP NAT                    October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
   communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to
   TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address
   Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP
   that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and use private
   addresses (see [RFC5735]) and yet use only a single globally unique
   IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind a NAT) choose the same port
   numbers for their connection.  This additional code is sometimes
   classified as Network Address and Port Translation or NAPT.  To date,
   specialized code for SCTP has not yet been added to most NATs so that
   only true NAT is available.  The end result of this is that only one
   SCTP capable host can be behind a NAT.

   This document proposes an SCTP specific variant NAT that provides the
   NAPT functionality without changing SCTP port numbers.  The authors
   feel it is possible and desirable to make these changes for a number
   of reasons.

   o  It is desirable for SCTP internal end-hosts on multiple platforms
      to be able to share a NAT's public IP address, much as TCP does
      today.

   o  If a NAT does not need to change any data within an SCTP packet it
      will reduce the processing burden of NAT'ing SCTP by NOT needing
      to execute the CRC32c checksum required by SCTP.

   o  Not having to touch the IP payload makes the processing of ICMP
      messages in NATs easier.

3.  Terminology

   For this discussion we will use several terms, which we will define
   and point out in Figure 1.

   Private-Address (Priv-Addr):  The private address that is known to
      the internal host.

Internet-Draft                  SCTP NAT                    October 2012


   Internal-Port (Int-Port):  The port number that is in use by the host
      holding the Private-Address.

   Internal-VTag (Int-VTag):  The Verification Tag that the internal
      host has chosen for its communication.  The VTag is a unique 32
      bit tag that must accompany any incoming SCTP packet for this
      association to the Private-Address.

   External-Address (Ext-Addr):  The address that an internal host is
      attempting to contact.

   External-Port (Ext-Port):  The port number of the peer process at the
      External-Address.

   External-VTag (Ext-VTag):  The Verification Tag that the host holding
      the External-Address has chosen for its communication.  The VTag
      is a unique 32 bit tag that must accompany any incoming SCTP
      packet for this association to the External-Address.

   Public-Address (Pub-Addr):  The public address assigned to the NAT
      box which it uses as a source address when sending packets towards
      the External-Address.

4.  SCTP NAT Traversal Scenarios

   This section defines the notion of single and multi-point NAT
   traversal.

4.1.  Single Point Traversal

   In this case, all packets in the SCTP association go through a single
   NAT, as shown below:

   +---------+            |               /--\/--\           +---------+
   |  SCTP   |         +-----+           /        \          |  SCTP   |
   |end point|=========| NAT |========= | Internet | ========|end point|
   |    A    |         +-----+           \        /          |    B    |
   +---------+            |               \--/\--/           +---------+
                          |

                            Single NAT scenario

   A variation of this case is shown below, i.e., multiple NATs in a
   single path:

          Internal | External : Internal | External
                   |          :          |
   +---------+     |          :          |       /--\/--\    +---------+
   |  SCTP   |  +-----+       :       +-----+   /        \   |  SCTP   |
   |end point|==| NAT |=======:=======| NAT |==| Internet |==|end point|
   |    A    |  +-----+       :       +-----+   \        /   |    B    |
   +---------+     |          :          |       \--/\--/    +---------+
                   |          :          |

                           Serial NATs scenario

   In this single point traversal scenario, we must acknowledge that
   while one of the main benefits of SCTP multi-homing is redundant
   paths, the NAT function represents a single point of failure in the
   path of the SCTP multi-home association.  However, the rest of the
   path may still benefit from path diversity provided by SCTP multi-
   homing.

   The two SCTP endpoints in this case can be either single-homed or
   multi-homed.  However, the important thing is that the NAT (or NATs)
   in this case sees all the packets of the SCTP association.

4.2.  Multi Point Traversal

   This case involves multiple NATs and each NAT only sees some of the
   packets in the SCTP association.  An example is shown below:

   +---------+  /=======|NAT A |=========\  /          \     +---------+
   |  SCTP   | /        +------+          \/            \    |  SCTP   |
   |end point|/       ...                 |   Internet   |===|end point|
   |    A    |\                            \            /    |    B    |
   +---------+ \        +------+          / \          /     +---------+
                \=======|NAT B |=========/   \---\/---/
                        +------+
                           |

                          Parallel NATs scenario

   This case does NOT apply to a single-homed SCTP association (i.e.,
   BOTH endpoints in the association use only one IP address).  The
   advantage here is that the existence of multiple NAT traversal points
   can preserve the path diversity of a multi-homed association for the
   entire path.  This in turn can improve the robustness of the
   communication.


5.  Limitations of Classical NAPT for SCTP

   Using classical NAPT may result in changing one of the SCTP port
   numbers during the processing which requires the recomputation of the
   transport layer checksum.  Whereas for UDP and TCP this can be done
   very efficiently, for SCTP the checksum (CRC32c) over the entire
   packet needs to be recomputed.  This would add considerable to the
   NAT computational burden, however hardware support may mitigate this
   in some implementations.

   An SCTP endpoint may have multiple addresses but only has a single
   port number.  To make multipoint traversal work, all the NATs
   involved must recognize the packets they see as belonging to the same
   SCTP association and perform port number translation in a consistent
   way.  One possible way of doing this is to use pre-defined table of
   ports and addresses configured within each NAT.  Other mechanisms
   could make use of NAT to NAT communication.  Such mechanisms are
   considered by the authors not to be deployable on a wide scale base
   and thus not a recommended solution.  Therefore the SCTP variant of
   NAT has been developed.


6.  The SCTP Specific Variant of NAT

   In this section we assume that we have multiple SCTP capable hosts
   behind a NAT which has one Public-Address.  Furthermore we are
   focusing in this section on the single point traversal scenario.

Internet-Draft                  SCTP NAT                    October 2012


   The modification of SCTP packets sent to the public Internet is easy.
   The source address of the packet has to be replaced with the Public-
   Address.  It may also be necessary to establish some state in the NAT
   box to handle incoming packets, which is discussed later.

   For SCTP packets coming from the public Internet the destination
   address of the packets has to be replaced with the Private-Address of
   the host the packet has to be delivered to.  The lookup of the
   Private-Address is based on the External-VTag, External-Port,
   External-Address, Internal-VTag and the Internal-Port.

   For the SCTP NAT processing the NAT box has to maintain a table of
   Internal-VTag, Internal-Port, Private-Address, External-VTag,
   External-Port and whether the restart procedure is disabled or not.
   An entry in that table is called a NAT state control block.  The
   function Create() obtains the just mentioned parameters and returns a
   NAT-State control block.

   The entries in this table fulfill some uniqueness conditions.  There
   must not be more than one entry with the same pair of Internal-Port
   and External-Port.  This rule can be relaxed, if all entries with the
   same Internal-Port and External-Port have the support for the restart
   procedure enabled.  In this case there must be no more than one entry
   with the same Internal-Port, External-Port and Ext-VTag and no more
   than one entry with the same Internal-Port, External-Port and Int-
   VTag.

   The processing of outgoing SCTP packets containing an INIT-chunk is
   described in the following figure.  The scenario shown is valid for
   all message flows in this section.

                      Create(Initiate-Tag, Int-Port, Priv-Addr, 0)
                      Returns(NAT-State control block)

              Translate To:

                           INIT[Initiate-Tag]
              Pub-Addr:Int-Port ------> Ext-Addr:Ext-Port
                               Ext-VTag=0


   It should be noted that normally a NAT control block will be created.
   However, it is possible that there is already a NAT control block
   with the same External-Address, External-Port, Internal-Port, and
   Internal-VTag but different Private-Address.  In this case the INIT
   SHOULD be dropped by the NAT and an ABORT SHOULD be sent back to the
   SCTP host with the M-Bit set and an appropriate error cause (see
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-natsupp] for the format).

   It is also possible that a connection to External-Address and
   External-Port exists without an Internal-VTag conflict but the
   External-Address does not support the DISABLE_RESTART feature (noted
   in the NAT control block when the prior connection was established).
   In such a case the INIT SHOULD be dropped by the NAT and an ABORT
   SHOULD be sent back to the SCTP host with the M-Bit set and an
   appropriate error cause (see [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-natsupp] for the
   format).

   The processing of outgoing SCTP packets containing no INIT-chunk is
   described in the following figure.

   The processing of incoming SCTP packets containing INIT-ACK chunks is
   described in the following figure.  The Lookup() function getting as
   input the Internal-VTag, Internal-Port, External-VTag (=0), External-
   Port, and External-Address, returns the corresponding entry of the
   NAT table and updates the External-VTag by substituting it with the
   value of the Initiate-Tag of the INIT-ACK chunk.  The wildcard
   character signifies that the parameter's value is not considered in
   the Lookup() function or changed in the Update() function,
   respectively.

   an External-VTag of zero is found, it is considered a match and the
   External-VTag is updated.

   This allows the handling of INIT-collision through NAT.


7.  NAT to SCTP

   This document at various places discusses the sending of specialized
   SCTP chunks (e.g. an ABORT with M-Bit set).  These chunks and
   procedures are not defined in this document, but instead are defined
   in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-natsupp].  The NAT implementer should refer to
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-natsupp] for detailed descriptions of packet formats
   and procedures.


8.  Handling of Fragmented SCTP Packets

   A NAT box MUST support IP reassembly of received fragmented SCTP
   packets.  The fragments may arrive in any order.

   When an SCTP packet has to be fragmented by the NAT box and the IP
   header forbids fragmentation a corresponding ICMP packet SHOULD be
   sent.


9.  Various Examples of NAT Traversals

9.1.  Single-homed Client to Single-homed Server

   The internal client starts the association with the external server
   via a four-way-handshake.  Host A starts by sending an INIT chunk.

   Host A announces its second address in an ASCONF chunk.  The address
   parameter contains an undefined address (0) to indicate that the
   source address should be added.  The lookup address parameter within
   the ASCONF chunk will also contain the pair of VTags (external and
   internal) so that the NAT may populate its table completely with this
   single packet.

9.4.  NAT Loses Its State

   Association is already established between Host A and Host B, when
   the NAT loses its state and obtains a new public address.  Host A
   sends a DATA chunk to Host B.

   The NAT box cannot find entry for the association.  It sends ERROR
   message with the M-Bit set and the cause "NAT state missing".

   On reception of the ERROR message, Host A sends an ASCONF chunk
   indicating that the former information has to be deleted and the
   source address of the actual packet added.

9.5.  Peer-to-Peer Communication

   If two hosts are behind NATs, they have to get knowledge of the
   peer's public address.  This can be achieved with a so-called
   rendezvous server.  Afterwards the destination addresses are public,
   and the association is set up with the help of the INIT collision.
   The NAT boxes create their entries according to their internal peer's
   point of view.  Therefore, NAT A's Internal-VTag and Internal-Port
   are NAT B's External-VTag and External-Port, respectively.  The
   naming of the verification tag in the packet flow is done from the
   sending peer's point of view.


             Internal | External           External | Internal
                      |                             |

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions from IANA.


11.  Security Considerations

   State maintenance within a NAT is always a subject of possible Denial
   Of Service attacks.  This document recommends that at a minimum a NAT
   runs a timer on any SCTP state so that old association state can be
   cleaned up.
