      <t>
        Simple Web Discovery (SWD) defines an HTTPS GET based mechanism to discover the location of a given type of service for a given principal
        starting only with a domain name. SWD requests use
	query parameters
	to specify a URI for the principal and another URI
        for the type of service being sought. If the request is successful then the response, by default, is a
	JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <xref target="RFC4627"/>
	object containing an array of URIs that point to where the
        principal has instances of services of the requested type.
      </t>

      <t>For example, let us say that a requester wants to discover where Joe keeps his calendar. The requester could take Joe's e-mail address,
      <spanx style="verb">joe@example.com</spanx>, and use its domain to create an HTTPS GET request of the following form
      (with long lines broken for display purposes only):</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[GET /.well-known/simple-web-discovery
    ?principal=mailto:joe@example.com
    &service=urn:example:service:calendar HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
 "locations": ["https://calendars.example.net/calendars/joseph"]
}]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>Note: The request-URI is left unencoded in the above example
      for the sake of readability.  The query parameters above would
      actually be encoded as
      <spanx style="verb">?principal=mailto%3Ajoe%40example.com&amp;service=urn%3Aexample%3Aservice%3Acalendar</spanx>.</t>

        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Simple Web Discovery Request">
      <t>Domains that support SWD requests MUST make available a SWD server for their domain at the path <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/simple-web-discovery</spanx>. 
      The syntax and semantics of <spanx style="verb">/.well-known</spanx> are defined in <xref target="RFC5785">RFC 5785</xref>.
      <spanx style="verb">simple-web-discovery</spanx> MUST point to a SWD server compliant with this specification.</t>

      <t>
        SWD servers MUST support receiving SWD requests via TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/> and MAY support 
        other transport layer security mechanisms of equivalent security. SWD servers MUST reject SWD requests sent over plain HTTP or any other
        transport that does not provide both privacy and validation of the server's identity.
      </t>

      <t>
        A SWD server is queried using an HTTPS GET request with the
        previously specified path along with a query segment
        containing a form encoded using the
	application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding algorithm
	as defined in <xref
        target="W3C.REC-html401-19991224">HTML 4.01</xref>. The form
        MUST contain two name/value pairs that MUST appear exactly
        once, <spanx style="verb">principal</spanx> and <spanx
        style="verb">service</spanx>. Both name/value pairs MUST have
        values that are set to URIs <xref target="RFC3986"/>.
	If any of the previous
        requirements are not met in a SWD request, then the request
        MUST be rejected with a 400 Bad Request.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The SWD request form MAY contain additional name/value pairs but if those name/value pairs are not recognized by the SWD server then the SWD
        server MUST ignore them for processing purposes.
      </t>

      <t>
        The <spanx style="verb">principal</spanx> query component is a
        URI that identifies an entity. The <spanx
        style="verb">service</spanx> query component is a URI that
        identifies a service type. The semantics of the SWD query is
        "Please return the location(s) of instances of the specified
        service type associated with the specified principal". The
        definition of URIs used to identify principals and services
        are outside the scope of this specification.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Simple Web Discovery Responses">
      <section title="Response Containing One or More Locations">
        <t>Unless another content-type is negotiated, a 200
        OK response to a SWD request that contains the information
        requested MUST return content of type application/json
	<xref target="RFC4627"/>. The JSON
        response MUST contain a JSON object that contains a member
        pair whose name is the string <spanx
        style="verb">locations</spanx> and whose value is an array of
        strings that are each a URI pointing to a location where the
        desired service type belonging to the specified principal can
        be found. There are no semantics associated with the order in
        which the URIs are listed in the array.</t>
        
        <t>The JSON object MAY contain other members but a receiver of the object MAY ignore any member pairs whose name it does not recognize.</t>
        
      </section>
      <section title="Redirecting All Simple Web Discovery Requests">
        <t>
          SWD requests by definition start off by being issued to the
          <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/simple-web-discovery</spanx> location. But locating a
          SWD server at a root location can prove inconvenient. To
          enable service level redirection, a SWD server MAY return a
          200 OK to an HTTPS request with a content type of
          application/json (or whatever other content type has been
          negotiated) that contains a JSON object that contains a
          member pair whose name is the string <spanx
          style="verb">SWD_service_redirect</spanx> whose value is a
          JSON object with a member pair whose name is <spanx
          style="verb">location</spanx> and whose value is a string
          that encodes a URI. Optionally, the JSON object value of
          <spanx style="verb">SWD_service_redirect</spanx> MAY also
          contain a member whose name is <spanx
          style="verb">expires</spanx> and whose value is a JSON
          number that encodes an integer.
        </t>
				
	<t>
	  A SWD compliant client MUST support the <spanx
	  style="verb">SWD_service_redirect</spanx> response.
	</t>

        <t>
          The JSON objects MAY contain other members but a receiver of
          the objects MAY ignore any pairs whose name it does not
          recognize.
        </t>

        <t>
          The <spanx style="verb">location</spanx> member identifies
          the URI that the caller MUST redirect all SWD requests for
          that domain to until the <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx>
          time has passed. SWD requests for the redirected domain MUST be
          constructed by taking the URI returned in the <spanx
          style="verb">location</spanx> and using it as the base URI
          to which the SWD form arguments are then added as query
          parameters. The location URI MUST NOT include a query
          component.
        </t>

        example for the sake of readability.</t>

        <t>
          The <spanx style="verb">location</spanx> URI MUST be an HTTPS URL.
        </t>

        <t>
          The optional <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx> member
          identifies the point in time at which the caller MUST NOT
          redirect its SWD requests for that domain to the previously
          obtained <spanx style="verb">location</spanx> and MUST instead return to the
          <spanx style="verb">/.well-known/simple-web-discovery</spanx> location.  The value of the
          <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx> member MUST encode the
          number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC
          until the desired date/time. See <xref target="RFC3339">RFC 3339</xref>
	  for details regarding date/times in general and
          UTC in particular. If the <spanx
          style="verb">expires</spanx> value is in the past or if the
          value is more than one hour in the future then the response
          MUST be treated as if it didn't contain an <spanx
          style="verb">expires</spanx> value.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx> value is omitted
          or if its value is incorrect then the <spanx
          style="verb">expires</spanx> value MUST be treated as having
          a value of exactly one hour into the future.
        </t>

        <t>
          If a JSON response is received that contains both a member
          pair with the name <spanx
          style="verb">SWD_service_redirect</spanx> and a member pair
          with the name <spanx style="verb">locations</spanx> as
          children of the object root then the <spanx
          style="verb">SWD_service_redirect</spanx> member pair MUST
          be ignored.

      <section title="401 Unauthorized Response">
        <t>
          A SWD server MAY respond to a request with a 401
          Unauthorized Response, as described in
	  <xref target="RFC2616">RFC 2616</xref>, Section 10.  Per the RFC,
          the request MAY be repeated with a suitable Authorization
          header field.  Authorization information may be communicated
          in this manner, including a JSON Web Token <xref
          target="JWT"></xref>.
	</t>
	</section>

      <section title="Other HTTP 1.1 Responses">
        <t>
          A SWD server MAY return other HTTP 1.1 responses, including
          404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request, and 403 Forbidden.  SWD
          implementations MUST correctly handle these responses.

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        SWD responses can contain confidential information.  Therefore
        a, general approach is used to require TLS in all cases. But
        TLS can only provide for privacy and server validation, it
        cannot validate that the requester is authorized to see the
        results of a query.  The exact mechanism used to determine if
        the requester is authorized to see the result of the query is
        outside the scope of this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
	Because SWD responses can contain confidential information,
	the requestor may need authorization to receive them.
	Standard HTTP authorization mechanisms MAY be employed to
	request authorized access, including the use of an HTTP
	Authorization header field in requests, which in turn, may
	contain a JSON Web Token <xref target="JWT"></xref>, among
	other authorization data formats.
      </t>
      <t>
        The ability to redirect an entire SWD server as defined in
        this document is an obvious attack point. This is another
        reason why we have mandated TLS, so as to be sure that the
        redirect can only be received over a secure connection. We
        have also put in the upper limit of 60 minutes for a redirect
        so as to provide a path for regaining control over queries
        should a successful attack be launched to return false
        redirects.
      </t>
      <t>
        The <spanx style="verb">SWD_service_redirect</spanx>
        capability may cause unanticipated failures in cases where a
        requestor may have permissions to discover content at the
        original SWD endpoint but not the one redirected to, or
        vice-versa.
