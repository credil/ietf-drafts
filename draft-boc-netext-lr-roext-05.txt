Abstract

   The communication path between two Hosts within a Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain is artificially long - it involves the LMA, even if straight
   paths exist (under same MAG, or MAG-to-MAG).  Localized Routing
   PMIPv6-LR concepts developped by NETEXT WG make use of LRI/LRA
   messages to achieve optimized MAG-to-MAG straight paths.  This may
   prove inconvenient for the network operator, in that it may loose
   ability to control traffic (LMA control point is skipped).

   In this draft we present a middle-ground solution.  It employs new
   Intermediary Anchors (IAs) in the paths between MAGs and offers
   points of control of traffic useful for QoS and lawful interception.

2.  Concentrated Description

   The work presented in this draft is developped in the context of
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] and uses LRI/LRA messages used by
   Localized Routing [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip-lr].

   The relevant scenarios are represented by communication between two
   Hosts typically situated each under a different MAG.

   In this figure, on the left side, the established tunnels T1 and T2
   for communication between Host1 and Host2 are shown, after the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 protocol has executed.  Each tunnel is established
   between LMA and the MAG under which a Host is attached.  This
   illustration is typically used to express a problem of too long
   communication paths.

   In the right part of the same figure, the Direct Tunnel between two
   MAGs is illustrated as a solution to the problem of artificially long
   paths through LMA.  This is achieved by using Localized Routing
   concepts of Proxy Mobile IPv6.  The diagonal lines represent
   signalling (not wires).

   There may exist situations when MAG-LMA-MAG communication paths are
   too long and yet the straight MAG-MAG paths may prove disadvantageous
   in terms of loss of operator control on various aspects of the
   traffic.  A middle ground solution as a bent arch path (not fully

   In this figure a new entity is added between MAGs - the Intermediate
   Anchor (IA).  The tunnels T1 and T2 are established between the IA
   and the two MAGs respectively (instead of LMA).  The IA serves
   purposes such as ensuring a certain level of control over the route
   optimized traffic, such as providing a certain level of Quality-of-
   Service, or, potentially, enabling data traffic enforcement for
   lawful interception.  Several such IAs may be placed at strategic
   points within the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

   The LMA is pre-configured statically with information about the IP
   addresses of all MAGs, and, new, IAs in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.

   To illustrate this procedure in a generic manner, we consider two IAs
   instead of one.  In the following figure, we assume that IA1 and IA2
   are positioned in a "sequential" manner between the MAG1 and MAG2.
   This is to illustrate that the mechanism pertains to situations where
   more IAs are used, and not only one.

   Initially, H1 and H2 exchange Data through the tunnels setup by Proxy
   Mobile IPv6, via LMA and the respective MAGs (the first 4 double-
   arrowed lines at the top of the illustration) .

   Subsequently, a certain trigger (to be defined) starts the Route
   Optimization procedure.  The procedure consists in LRI and LRA
   messages.  The LMA sends an LRI to IA1 and to IA2 respectively.  In a
   same centralized manner, LMA sends the same type of messages to MAG1
   and MAG2 respectively.  There are as many LRI messages as there are
   IAs plus (always) two MAGs.  The LRI messages instruct the receivers
   about the IP addresses of the entities in question.  For example,
   LRI_IA1 informs IA1 about the IP address of IA2.

   When the last LRA has been received from a second MAG, it can be
   considered that the paths have been "route optimized", i.e.  LMA is
   no longer in the path.  The Data traffic between H1 and H2 is
   exchanged via IAs and MAGs exclusively (LMA is skipped).

3.  LMA Behaviour

   LMA is pre-configured with each address of each MAG and of each IA in
   the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  In addition, it has topology
   information about the placement of these entities (IA, MAG) with
   respect to each other, and can know the IP distances (hopcount)
   between each to each other.  For example, for two given MAGs, it
   knows the shortest path and the IP addresses of the intervening IAs.

   LMA is expecting a trigger indicating that the Route Optimization
   procedure should start.  This trigger is to be defined.  In one
   sense, LMA could deduce this trigger when its Binding Cache is
   updated.  Speculatively, the addresses stored in the Binding Cache
   could indicate that two Hosts are under MAGs of same LMA, and that
   their tunnels are using LMA.

   The LMA emits LRI messages and, for each LRI sent it waits for an
   LRA.  It sends the following LRI only when the preceding LRI has been
   arcknowledged by an LRA.

4.  MAG Behaviour

   MAG receives LRI messages, and does not generate such.  When LRI is
   received, it executes indications contained in it.  Upon completion,
   it sends LRA to the originator of the LRI (the LMA) explaining the
   success or error of execution.  MAG does not receive LRA.

5.  IA Behaviour

   IA behaviour is similar to that of MAG.

6.  Security Considerations

   Lawful interception is probably the single most unique kind of
   requirement difficult to fit within the otherwise very powerful
   security architecture of Internet.  It is not immediately obvious
   whether techniques addressing this particular requirement effectively
   influence or are influenced by Internet security.

   LRI and LRA messages should be protected by using IPsec.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Other than Authors, a number of persons are involved with
   implementation and protection of this technique.  For example,
   Sofiane Imadali is designing and implementing a testbed prototype
   with C, linux and Ethernet, under wise guidance of advisor.

   Administratively, this work has been performed in the framework of
   CELTIC project CP7-011 MEVICO.  The authors would like to acknowledge
   the contributions of their colleagues, although the views expressed
   are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the
   project.
