    Abstract 

       Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in RFC 5213 [1], is a network-
       based mobility management protocol. It uses a Mobile Access Gateway 
       (MAG) and a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to allow hosts to move around 
       within a domain while keeping their address or address prefix stable. 
       Although the issues of mobile multicast in the PMIPv6 network are 
       being discussed in the Multimob WG, how to provide the service 
       connectivity when the multicast source is moving is still a problem 
       for the PMIPv6. This document proposes and analyzes the potential 
       solutions of the multicast source mobility in PMIPv6.

     1. Introduction 

       Different from Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [2], PMIPv6 was proposed to 
       support the network-based mobility management. The entities in the 
       PMIPv6 have the responsibilities to track the Mobile Node (MN), 
       update the location of the MN and redirect the packets to and from 
       the MN. However, the basic PMIPv6 protocol only solves the mobility 
       management for the MN which is involved in the unicast communication. 
       In order to deploy the multicast service in the PMIPv6 network, many 
       schemes have been proposed [3-6]. However, all of these schemes aim 
       to support the multicast service for the mobile receiver. How to 
       support the multicast source mobility in the PMIPv6 network is a 
       newly planned work in the Multimob WG. Without doubt, the multicast 
       source mobility is also a very important issue for the deployment of 
       the multicast service. For example, there is an advanced concept 
       based on the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) service. In this 
       concept, all the vehicles on the same route are identified by using a 
       GPS or a car-navigation system. The vehicles multicast real-time 
       video information about the transportation through the communication 
       infrastructure like 3G, WiFi to the other vehicles interested in it. 
       This advance information is called as 'future vision' [7]. The 
       multicast source mobility is one of the core supporting schemes to 
       realize the above functions. 

       In this document, the potential solutions of the multicast source 
       mobility in PMIPv6 are proposed and analyzed.  

     2. Problem statement 

       In PMIPv6 base solution, the LMA and the MAG are two most important 
       functional entities. The LMA is the home agent for the MN in a PMIPv6 
       domain. It is the topological anchor point for the MN's home network 
       prefix(es) and is the entity that manages the MN's binding state. The 
       MAG is a function on an access router that manages the mobility-
       related signaling for an MN that is attached to its access link. It 
       is responsible for tracking the MN's movements to and from the access 
       link and for signaling the MN's LMA. Therefore, the topological 
       location of the MN is not equal to the actual location in the PMIPv6 
       networks, which brings some problems for the multicast packet 
       transmission. 

       And according to the statements in the Section 6.10.5 in RFC5213, 
       when the MAG receives a packet from an MN connected to its access 
       link, to a destination that is not directly connected, the packet 
       MUST be forwarded to the LMA through the bi-directional tunnel 
       established between the MAG and the MN's LMA. And in Section 6.3 in 
       RFC5213 it is assumed that the link between the MN and the MAG have 
     
     
    Zhang et al.            Expires January, 2012                 [Page 3]

       multicast capability. However, there is no related description on the 
       transmission of the multicast data in RFC5213, that is, there is no 
       scheme about the multicast data forwarding. Thus, the MAG does not 
       explicitly support the multicast communication. When the multicast 
       traffic flows arrive at the MAG, for there is no Multicast Forwarding 
       Information Base (MFIB) on the MAG, it will not be forwarded or 
       transmitted through the bi-directional tunnel between the MAG and the 
       LMA and then these packets would be simply discarded by the MAG. 

       And even though the multicast packets can be transmitted to the LMA 
       by some special processing, whether the LMA could carry out the 
       functionality of the Designated Router (DR) can not be guaranteed. 
       That is, whether the LMA can execute the source registration to the 
       Rendezvous Point (RP) in the Any Source Multicast (ASM) scenario is 
       not sure. And similarly in the Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) case, 
       whether the LMA could forward the packets received from the tunnel 
       interface to the other multicast router according to the related MFIB 
       is also not sure. It is possibly because that the LMA is not directly 
       connected to the source and the network prefix of the LMA's interface 
       address is different from the Home Network Prefix (HNP) of the MN. 

       In Section 3, the above mentioned problems of multicast source 
       mobility in PMIPv6 will be discussed and also some possible solutions 
       are proposed. 

     3. Multicast source mobility scheme in PMIPv6 

       In this section, according to the problem statement in Section 2 and 
       the path of the multicast packet transmission, it is divided into two 
       parts to describe the scheme of the multicast source mobility in 
       PMIPv6.  

    3.1. Data transmission through tunneling 

       Because the MAG does not explicitly support the multicast 
       communication, in order to make the multicast data be forwarded or 
       transmitted through the bi-directional tunnel between the MAG and the 
       LMA based on the PMIPv6 protocol, two possible solutions for that are 
       given as follows. 

       Solution I: some extensions on the PMIPv6 are required for the 
       transmission of the multicast data. By establishing multicast 
       forwarding states on the MAG based on the PMIPv6, the multicast data 
       sent by the mobile source can be forwarded through the LMA-MAG tunnel 
       to the LMA after receiving this packet on the MAG. That is, after the 
       MAG builds the PMIPv6 tunnel and adds route for the anycast packets 
       originated from or destined to the MN, it should also update the

       Multicast Forwarding Cache (MFC) for the multicast traffic. Figure 1 
       shows the detailed procedure of this solution.

                  Figure 1: Procedure of extending the PMIPv6 

       The detailed descriptions are as follows: 

       1) The MN connects to the MAG initially and sends Router 
          Solicitation (RS) message to the MAG; 

       2) When the attachment of MN is detected by the MAG, it obtains the 
          group address as well as LMAA and MN_ID from the profile. Then an 
          extended Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message is sent to the LMA. 
          Because the LMA finds the Multicast address option contained in 
          the PBU message, the LMA decide whether the MN is authorized to 
          send multicast data to the group address. And then the LMA sends 
          back an extended Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) message to 
          the MAG. Afterwards, the tunnel is established in the LMA; 

       3) The MAG on receiving the PBA message sets up its endpoint of the 
          bi-directional tunnel to the LMA and then sets up the forwarding 
          for the MN's unicast traffic. At the same time, in order to 
          support multicast source mobility, the MAG should also update the 
          MFC in the kernel. And then it sends Router Advertisement (RA)

          message to the MN on the access link advertising the MN's HNP as 
          the hosted on-link prefix; 

       4) The same as the specification in RFC5213, when the MAG receives a 
          multicast packet from an MN connected to its access link, to a 
          multicast destination that has been authorized by the LMA, the 
          MAG will forward this packet to the LMA through the bi-
          directional tunnel established between itself and the LMA.  

       And the format of the tunnel multicast packets is shown below. 

         IPv6 header (src= Proxy-CoA, dst= LMAA)  /*Tunnel Header*/ 
               IPv6 header (src= MN-HoA, dst= GRPA)  /*Packet Header*/ 
                  Upper layer protocols              /*Packet Content*/ 

       Solution II: some extra functions, such as MLD Proxy as discussed in 
       RFC 4605 [8] and [draft-schmidt-multimob-pmipv6-base-source] [9], 
       could be used to transmit the multicast data through the tunnel of 
       the PMIPv6. The MLD proxy functions are deployed at the MAG as 
       described in RFC 6224 [10] and the MLD proxy instance serving a 
       mobile multicast source configures its upstream interface at the 
       tunnel towards the MN's corresponding LMA. For each LMA, there will 
       be a separate instance of an MLD proxy. 

       Although multicast communication can be enabled in PMIPv6 domains by 
       deploying MLD Proxy functions at MAG, some disadvantages still exist. 
       Firstly, for a proxy device performing IGMP/MLD-based forwarding has 
       a single upstream interface and one or more downstream interfaces as 
       described in RFC4605, there should be many MLD Proxy functions 
       deployed at one MAG, which is complicated and then is difficult for 
       implementation and management. And then when the multicast packets 
       arrive at the MAG running multiple parallel MLD proxy functions, 
       there may be confusions for the data if there is no extra processing 
       or filtering scheme at the MAG. In addition, the route optimization 
       issue is still up in the air, that is, for a mobile receiver and a 
       source on the same MAG using different LMAs, the traffic has to go up 
       to one LMA, cross over to the other LMA, and then be tunneled back to 
       the same MAG, causing redundant flows in the access network and at 
       the MAG.  

       Therefore, the MLD Proxy function should be extended to accommodate 
       the PMIPv6 protocol. As same as the document [9] and [10], the MLD 
       proxy functions are deployed at the MAG, while only one MLD Proxy 
       function is required to run at the MAG and multiple upstream 
       interfaces can be set for the MLD Proxy instance, which is called 
       Multi-Upstream Interfaces MLD Proxy (MUIMP). Figure 2 shows the 
     
     
    Zhang et al.            Expires January, 2012                 [Page 6]

       architecture of the MUIMP deploying in PMIPv6 for the multicast 
       source mobility. As shown in Figure 2, the paths among the MAGs and 
       the LMA represented by "||", "|o|" and "/*/" indicate the tunnels in 
       base PMIPv6 for the MN1, MN2, and MNn, respectively. In this way, 
       when the multicast data sent by the mobile source gets to the MAG 
       from the downstream interface of an MLD proxy, the MAG forwards this 
       data to the corresponding upstream interface according to the Binding 
       Update List Entry (BULE) for example at this MAG and to all but the 
       incoming downstream interfaces with appropriate forwarding states for 
       this group. And the specific scheme for the choice of the 
       corresponding upstream interface is outside of this document. 
       Therefore, multicast packets originating from an MN/mobile source 
       will arrive at the corresponding LMA and directly at all mobile 
       receivers co-located at the same MAG. Figure 3 shows the signaling 
       call flow of the MN attachment in this scheme. And when the MN leaves, 
       after the deregistration of the PMIPv6 for MNs, the MUIMP deletes the 
       corresponding upstream tunnel interface for each MN which leaves. 
       When the MN hands over, it is the same course as the MN attached. And 
       this scheme can not only solve the route optimization issue as 
       mentioned in the document [9], but also can be easily to deploy, 
       implement and manage.

    3.2. Data transmission after tunneling 

       After the processing in Section 3.1, the multicast data arrives at 
       the LMA through the PMIPv6 tunnel and the subsequent data 
       transmission is illustrated in detail as follows.  

       When the LMA can conduct the DR function, the data transmission 
       procedures are described as follows. 

       In the scenario of ASM, the multicast receivers send the (*,G) join 
       message to the RP to establish the RPT from the RP to the receivers. 
       In this case, the LMA allows a mobile source to continuously send 
       data to the group through the LMA-MAG tunnel firstly. And then the 
       packets are transmitted from the LMA to the RP through the source 
     
     
    Zhang et al.            Expires January, 2012                 [Page 8]

       registration and then delivered to the receivers according to the 
       multicast routing protocols. When the MN hands over from one MAG to 
       another, only the PMIPv6 tunnel is updated and the movement of source 
       is transparent to the receivers. 

       When the data traffic of the multicast source exceeds a certain value 
       of data rate, the RP sends a (HoA,G) 'connection' message to the 
       DR/LMA to establish the SPT from the specific source to the RP. Then 
       the LMA parses this message and establishes the related multicast 
       state. And when the handover from the Rendezvous Point Tree (RPT) to 
       the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) happens, the receivers send the join 
       message (HoA,G) to join the SPT of the source, and then the LMA 
       receives this message and establishes the related multicast state. In 
       this way, the LMA-based SPT is established successfully and the 
       subsequent multicast data flow will be transmitted through the LMA-
       based SPT. However, the path between the LMA and the MN is still used 
       for the multicast packets transmission. Although the SPT handover 
       finishes, the practical path is not the topological shortest path 
       tree due to the existence of the PMIPv6 tunnel. 

       In the SSM case, the multicast receivers actively send the (HoA,G) 
       subscribe message, for the LMA is just the topological anchor point 
       of the source's Home Address (HoA) in the PMIPv6 network, this 
       message is delivered to the LMA firstly and then the LMA-based 
       multicast SPT from the LMA to the receivers can be established. 
       Accordingly, the SSM scenario with the LMA-based scheme is similar to 
       the SPT handover in the ASM scenario with the LMA-based scheme. And 
       the current SPT path is also not the topological shortest path tree 
       due to the existence of PMIPv6 tunnel. 

       As described in RFC 4601 [11], on receipt of data from S to G on 
       interface iif (incoming interface of the packet), the DR will firstly 
       check whether the source is directly connected and also the iif is 
       identical to the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) interface. However, 
       because the network prefix of the LMA's interfaces is not same with 
       the HNP allocated to the mobile source, the check of the source's 
       direct connection will not be successful and then the LMA may not 
       perform the function of the DR for the source. And when the LMA can 
       not conduct the DR function, some extensions on the LMA should be 
       needed, which will be our future work for the multicast source 
       mobility in PMIPv6. 

     4. Extensions of PMIPv6 

       The signaling messages and the related processing of basic PMIPv6 
       should be extended in order to notify the multicast source-related 
       information from the MAG to the LMA.

    4.1. MAG 

       In order to provide the multicast service during the MN's movement, 
       the MAG must recognize that the attached MN is a multicast source and 
       the corresponding multicast address must also be learned. These 
       information can be learned by the MAG during the authentication phase 
       for example. The particular procedure is out of this document. 

       When the MAG finds that the attached MN is a multicast source, it 
       should send the extended PBU message to the LMA. In the extended PBU 
       message, a one bit "S" flag is added and set to "1", which means the 
       MN is a multicast source. The multicast address is contained in the 
       Multicast address option when the "S" is set to "1".  

    4.2. LMA 

       When receiving the extended PBU message and finding the "S" flag is 
       set to "1", the LMA should send back an extended PBA message with the 
       "S" flag set to "1" to the MAG. And then the LMA establishes a tunnel 
       to the MAG as specified in PMIPv6.
