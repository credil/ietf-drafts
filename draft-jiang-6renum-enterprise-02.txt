1. Introduction

   IPv6 site renumbering is considered difficult. Network managers
   currently prefer to Provider Independent (PI) addressing for IPv6 to
   attempt to minimize the need for future renumbering. However,
   widespread use of PI may create very serious BGP4 scaling problems.
   It is thus desirable to develop tools and practices that may make
   renumbering a simpler process to reduce demand for IPv6 PI space. In
   any case, renumbering may be necessary for other reasons.

   This document undertakes scenario descriptions, including
   documentation of current capabilities and existing BCPs, for
   enterprise networks. It takes the analysis conclusions from [RFC5887]
   and other relevant documents as the primary input.

   This document focuses on IPv6 only, by leaving IPv4 out of scope.
   Dual-stack network or IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios are out of scope,
   too.

This document focuses on enterprise network renumbering, though most of
the analysis is also applicable to ISP network renumbering. Renumbering
in home networks is considered out of scope, though it may also benefit
from the analysis in this document.

The concept of enterprise network and a typical network illustration
are introduced first. Then, according to the different stages of
renumbering events, considerations and best current practices are
described in three categories: during network design, for preparation
of renumbering, and during renumbering operation. A gap inventory is
listed at the end of this document.

2. Enterprise Network Illustration for Renumbering

   An Enterprise Network as defined in [RFC4057] is: a network that has
   multiple internal links, one or more router connections to one or
   more Providers, and is actively managed by a network operations
   entity.

   The enterprise network architecture is illustrated in the figure
   below. Those entities relevant to renumbering are highlighted.

   Address reconfiguration is fulfilled either by DHCPv6 or ND
   protocols. Static address assignment is not considered in this
   version. During the renumbering event, the DNS records need to be
   synchronized while routing tables, ACLs and IP filtering tables in
   various gateways also need to be updated, too.

3. Enterprise Network Renumbering Scenario Categories

   In this section, we divide enterprise network renumbering scenarios
   into two categories defined by external and internal network factors,
   which require renumbering for different reasons.

3.1. Renumbering caused by External Network Factors

   The most influential external network factor is the uplink ISP.








Jiang, et al.           Expires June 8, 2012                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  draft-jiang-6renum-enterprise-01.txt    September 2011


   o The enterprise network switches to a new ISP. Of course, the
      prefixes received from different ISPs are different. This is the
      most common scenario.

      Whether there is an overlap time between the old and new ISPs
      would also influence the possibility whether the enterprise can
      fulfill renumbering without a flag day [RFC4192].

   o The renumbering event may be initiated by receiving new prefixes
      from the same uplink. The typical scenario is that the DHCPv6
      server in the ISP delegates a new prefix to the enterprise network.
      This might happen if the enterprise network is switched to a
      different location within the network topology of the same ISP due
      to various considerations, such as commercial, performance or
      services reasons, etc. Alternatively, the ISP itself might be
      renumbered due to topology changes or migration to a different or
      additional prefix. These ISP renumbering events would initiate
      enterprise network renumbering events, of course.

   o The enterprise network adds new uplink(s) for multihoming
      purposes. This may not a typical renumbering because the original
      addresses will not be changed. However, initial numbering may be
      considered as a special renumbering event. If the administrators
      only want part of the network to have multiple prefixes, the
      renumbering process should be carefully managed.

   o The enterprise network removes uplink(s) or old prefixes.

3.2. Renumbering caused by Internal Network Factors

   o As companies split, merge, grow, relocate or reorganize, the
      enterprise network architectures may need to be re-built. This
      will trigger the internal renumbering.

   o The enterprise network may proactively adopt a new address scheme,
      for example by switching to a new transition mechanism or stage of
      a transition plan.

   o The enterprise network may reorganize its topology or subnets.

4. Network Renumbering Considerations and Best Current Practices

   In order to carry out renumbering in an enterprise network,
   systematic planning and administrative preparation are needed.
   Carefully planning and preparation could make the renumbering process
   smoother.

   This section tries to give the recommended solutions or strategies
   for the enterprise renumbering, chosen among existing mechanisms.
   There are known gaps analyzed by [I-D.liu-6renum-gap-analysis]. If
   these gaps are filled in the future, the enterprise renumbering may
   be processed more automatically, with fewer issues.

4.1. Considerations and Best Current Practices during Network Design

   This section describes the consideration or issues relevant to
   renumbering that a network architect should carefully plan when
   building or designing a new network.

      - Prefix Delegation

      In a large or a multi-site enterprise network, the prefix should
      be carefully managed, particularly during renumbering events.
      Prefix information needs to be delegated from router to router.
      The DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation options [RFC3633, I-D.ietf-dhc-pd-
      exclude] provide a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6
      prefixes. DHCPv6 PD options may also be used between the
      enterprise routers and their upstream ISPs.

      - Usage of FQDN

      In general, Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) are recommended
      to be used to configure network connectivity, such as tunnels,
      whenever possible. The capability to use FQDNs as endpoint names
      has been standardized in several RFCs, such as [RFC5996], although
      many system/network administrators do not realize that it is there
      and works well as a way to avoid manual modification during
      renumbering.

      Service Location Protocol [RFC2608] and multicast DNS with SRV
      records for service discovery can reduce the number of places that
      IP addresses need to be configured.

      - Address Types

      This document focuses on the dynamically-configured global unicast
      addresses in enterprise networks. They are the targets of
      renumbering events.

      Manual-configured addresses are not scalable in medium to large
      sites, hence are out of scope. However, some hosts such as servers
      may need static addresses. Manual-configured addresses/hosts
      should be avoided as much as possible.

      Unique Local Addresses (ULA, [RFC4193]) may be used for local
      communications, usually inside of enterprise networks. They can be
      sufficient for any host that is accessible only inside the
      enterprise network and has no need for external communication
      [RFC4864]. Normally, they do not need to be changed during a
      global prefix renumbering event. However, they may need to be
      renumbered in some rare scenarios, quite separate from the global
      prefix renumbering.

      - Address configuration models

      In IPv6 networks, there are two auto-configuration models for
      address assignment: Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC)
      by Neighbor Discovery (ND, [RFC4861, RFC4862]) and stateful
      address configuration by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
      IPv6 (DHCPv6, [RFC3315]). In the latest work, DHCPv6 can also
      support host-generated address model by assigning a prefix through
      DHCPv6 messages [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id].

      ND is considered easier to renumber by broadcasting a Router
      Advertisement message with a new prefix. DHCPv6 can also trigger
      the renumbering process by sending unicast RECONFIGURE messages,
      though it may cause a large number of interactions between hosts
      and DHCPv6 server.

      This document has no preference between ND and DHCPv6 address
      configuration models. It is network architects' job to decide
      which configuration model is employed. But it should be noticed
      that using DHCPv6 and ND together within one network, especially
      in one subnet, may cause operational issues. For example, some
      hosts use DHCPv6 as the default configuration model while some use
      ND. Then the hosts' address configuration model depends on the
      policies of operating systems and cannot be controlled by the
      network. Section 5.1 of [I-D.liu-6renum-gap-analysis] discusses
      more details on this topic. So, in general, this document
      recommends using DHCPv6/SLAAC independently in different subnets.

      However, since DHCPv6 is also used to configure many other network
      parameters, there are ND and DHCPv6 co-existence scenarios.
      Combinations of address configuration models may coexist within a
      single enterprise network. [I-D.ietf-savi-mix] provides
      recommendations to avoid collisions and to review collision
      handling in such scenarios.

      - DNS




Jiang, et al.           Expires June 8, 2012                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  draft-jiang-6renum-enterprise-01.txt    September 2011


      It is recommended that the site have an automatic and systematic
      procedure for updating/synchronising its DNS records, including
      both forward and reverse mapping [RFC2874]. A manual on-demand
      updating model is considered as a harmful source of problems in a
      renumbering event.

      Although the A6 DNS record model [RFC2874] was designed for easier
      renumbering, it has a lot of unsolved technical issues [RFC3364,
      I-D.jiang-dnsext-a6-to-historic]. Therefore, it has been moved to
      experimental status [RFC3363]. It is not recommended.

      In order to simplify the operation procedure, the network
      architect should combine the forward and reverse DNS updates in a
      single procedure.

      Often, a small site depends on its ISP's DNS system rather than
      maintaining its own. When renumbering, this requires
      administrative coordination between the site and its ISP.

      The DNS synchronization may be completed through the Secure DNS
      Dynamic Update [RFC3007]. Normally, the dynamic DNS update is
      achieved by DHCPv6 server on behalf of individual hosts. [RFC4704]
      defined a DHCPv6 option to be used by DHCPv6 clients and servers
      to exchange information about the client's FQDN and about who has
      the responsibility for updating the DNS with the associated AAAA
      and PTR RRs. For example, if a client wants the server to update
      the FQDN-address mapping in the DNS server, it can include the
      Client FQDN option with proper settings in the SOLICIT with Rapid
      Commit, REQUEST, RENEW, and REBIND message originated by the
      client. When DHCPv6 server gets this option, it can use the
      dynamic DNS update on behalf of the client. In this document, we
      promote to support this FQDN option. But since it's a DHCPv6
      option, it implies that only the DHCP-managed networks are
      suitable for this operation. In a model including SLAAC, host
      addresses may be registered on an address registration server,
      which could in fact be a DHCPv6 server; then the server would
      update corresponding DNS records.

      - Security

      Any automatic renumbering scheme has a potential exposure to
      hijacking at the moment that a new address is announced. Proper
      network security mechanisms are needed.

      For ND, Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND, [RFC3971]) is a possible
      solution, but it is complex and seems there's no real deployment
      so far according to the discussion in the IETF meeting. Comparing


Jiang, et al.           Expires June 8, 2012                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  draft-jiang-6renum-enterprise-01.txt    September 2011


      the non-trivial deployment of SEND, RA guard [RFC6105] is a light-
      weight alternative, however, it also hasn't been widely deployed
      since it hasn't been published for long.

      For DHCPv6, there are built-in secure mechanisms (like Secure
      DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6]), and authentication of DHCPv6
      messages [RFC3315]could be utilized. But they are also mechanisms
      that haven't been verified by wide real deployment.

      - Miscellaneous

      A site or network should also avoid embedding addresses from other
      sites or networks in its own configuration data. Instead, the
      Fully-Qualified Domain Names should be used. Thus, these
      connectivities can survive after renumbering events at other sites.
      This also applies to host-based connectivities.

4.2. Considerations and Best Current Practices for the Preparation of
   Renumbering

   It is not possible to reduce a prefix's lifetime to below two hours.
   So, renumbering should not be an unplanned sudden event. This issue
   could only be avoided by early planning and preparation.

   This section describes several recommendations for the preparation of
   enterprise renumbering event. By adopting these recommendations, a
   site could be renumbered more easily. However, these recommendations
   are not cost free. They might increase the daily burden of network
   operation. Therefore, only those networks that are expected to be
   renumbered soon or very frequently should adopt these recommendations,
   with balanced consideration between daily cost and renumbering cost.

      - Reduce the address preferred time or valid time or both.

      Long-lifetime addresses may cause issues for renumbering events.
      Particularly, some offline hosts may reconnect using these
      addresses after renumbering events. Shorter preferred lifetimes
      with relatively long valid lifetimes may allow short transition
      periods for renumbering events and avoid frequent address
      renewals.

      - Reduce the DNS record TTL on the local DNS server.

      The DNS AAAA resource record TTL on the local DNS server should be
      manipulated to ensure that stale addresses are not cached.

      - Reduce the DNS configuration lifetime on the hosts.


Jiang, et al.           Expires June 8, 2012                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft  draft-jiang-6renum-enterprise-01.txt    September 2011


      Since the DNS server could be renumbered as well, the DNS
      configuration lifetime on the hosts should also be reduced if
      renumbering events are expected. The DNS configuration can be done
      through either ND [RFC6106] or DHCPv6 [RFC3646].

      - Identify long-living sessions

      Any applications which maintain very long transport connections
      (hours or days) should be identified in advance, if possible. Such
      applications will need special handling during renumbering, so it
      is important to know that they exist.

4.3. Considerations and Best Current Practices during Renumbering
   Operation

   Renumbering events are not instantaneous events. Normally, there is a
   transition period, in which both the old prefix and the new prefix
   are used in the site. Better network design and management, better
   pre-preparation and longer transition period are helpful to reduce
   the issues during renumbering operation.

      - Within/without a flag day

      As is described in [RFC4192], "a 'flag day' is a procedure in
      which the network, or a part of it, is changed during a planned
      outage, or suddenly, causing an outage while the network
      recovers."

      If renumbering event is processed within a flag day, the network
      service/connectivity will be out for a period till the renumbering
      event is completed. It is efficient and provides convenience for
      network operation and management. But network outage is usually
      unacceptable for end users and enterprises. A renumbering
      procedure without a flag day provides smooth address switching,
      but much more operational complexity and difficulty is introduced.

      - Transition period

      If renumbering transition period is longer than all address
      lifetimes, after which the address leases expire, each host will
      automatically pick up its new IP address. In this case, it would
      be the DHCPv6 server or Router Advertisement itself that
      automatically accomplishes client renumbering.

      Address deprecation should be associated with the deprecation of
      associated DNS records. The DNS records should be deprecated as
      early as possible, before the addresses themselves.

      - Network initiative enforced renumbering

      If the network has to enforce renumbering before address leases
      expire, the network should initiate enforcement messages, either
      in Router Advertisement messages or DHCPv6 RECONFIGURE messages.

      - Impact to branch/main sites

      Renumbering in main/branch site may cause impact on branch/main
      site communication. The routes, ingress filtering of site's
      gateways, and DNS may need to be updated. This needs careful
      planning and organizing.

      - DNS record update and DNS configuration on hosts

      DNS records on the local DNS server should be updated if hosts are
      renumbered. If the site depends on ISP's DNS system, it should
      report the new host's DNS records to its ISP. During the
      transition period, both old and new DNS records are valid. If the
      TTLs of DNS records are shorter than the transition period, an
      administrative operation may not be necessary.

      DNS configuration on hosts should be updated if local recursive
      DNS servers are renumbered. During the transition period, both old
      and new DNS server addresses may co-exist on the hosts. If the
      lifetime of DNS configuration is shorter than the transition
      period, name resolving failure may be reduced to minimum. A
      notification mechanism may be needed to indicate to the hosts that
      a renumbering event of local recursive DNS happens or is going to
      take place.

      - Router awareness

      In a site with multiple border routers, all border routers should
      be aware of partial renumbering in order to correctly handle
      inbound packets. Internal forwarding tables need to be updated.

      - Border filtering

      In a multihomed site, an egress router to ISP A could normally
      filter packets with source addresses from other ISPs. The egress
      router connecting to ISP A should be notified if the egress router
      connecting to ISP B initiates a renumbering event in order to
      properly update its filter function.

      - Tunnel concentrator renumbering

      A tunnel concentrator itself might be renumbered. This change
      should be reconfigured in relevant hosts or routers, unless the
      configuration of tunnel concentrator was based on FQDN.

      - Connectivity session survivability

      During the renumbering operations, connectivity sessions in IP
      layer would break if the old address is deprecated before the
      session ends. However, the upper layer sessions may survive by
      using session survivability technologies, such as SHIM6 [RFC5533].
      As mentioned above, some long-living applications may need to be
      handled specially.

5. Gap Inventory

   This section lists a few issues that still appear to remain
   unsolvable (also see [I-D.liu-6renum-gap-analysis]). Some of them may
   be inherently unsolvable.

      -  Some environments like embedded systems might not use DHCPv6 or
         SLAAC and even configuration scripts might not be an option.
         This creates special problems that no general-purpose solution
         is likely to address.

      -  TCP and UDP flows can't survive a renumbering event at either
         end.

      -  The embedding of IPv6 unicast addresses into multicast
         addresses and the embedded-RP (Rendezvous Point) [RFC3956] will
         cause issues when renumbering.

      -  Changing the unicast source address of a multicast sender might
         also be an issue for receivers.

      -  When a renumbering event takes place, entries in the state
         table of tunnel concentrator that happen to contain the old
         addresses will become invalid and will eventually time out.
         However, this can be considered as harmless though it takes
         resources on these devices for a while.

      -  A site that is listed in an IP black list can escape that list
         by renumbering itself. The site itself of course will not
         report its renumbering and the black list may not be able to
         monitor or discover the renumbering event.

      -  Multihomed sites, using SLAAC for one address prefix and DHCPv6
         for another, would clearly create a risk of inconsistent host
         behaviour and operational confusion.

6. Security Considerations

   As noted, a site that is listed by IP address in a black list can
   escape that list by renumbering itself.

   Any automatic renumbering scheme has a potential exposure to
   hijacking at the moment that a new address is announced. Proper
   network security mechanisms are needed. Although there are existing
   security mechanisms such as SEND, RA guard, secure DHCPv6 etc., they
   haven't been widely deployed and haven't been verified whether they
   are suitable for ensuring security while not bringing too much
   operational complexity and cost.

   Dynamic DNS update may bring risk of DoS attack to the DNS server. So
   along with the update authentication, session filtering/limitation
   may also be needed.

   The "make-before-break" approach of [RFC4192] requires the routers
   keep advertising the old prefixes for some time. But if the ISP
   changes the prefixes very frequently, the co-existence of old and new
   prefixes may cause potential risk to the enterprise routing system.
   However, enterprise scenarios may not involve the extreme situation;
   this issue needs to be identified in the future.

   The security configuration updates will need to be made in two stages
   (immediately before and immediately after the event).

7. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
