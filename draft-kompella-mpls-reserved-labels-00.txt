              Allocating and Retiring MPLS Reserved Labels
                 draft-kompella-mpls-reserved-labels-00

Abstract

   There are a limited number of reserved labels defined for Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching.  Thus one must be cautious in the
   allocation of new reserved labels, yet at the same time allow forward
   progress when a new reserved label is called for.  This memo suggests
   some procedures to follow in the allocation and retirement of
   reserved labels.

Internet-Draft            MPLS Reserved Labels                March 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3032] defined four reserved label values for Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS), namely, 0 to 3, and set aside values 4 through 15
   for future use.  These labels have special significance in both the
   control and data plane.  Since then, two further values have been
   allocated, leaving ten unassigned values from the original space of
   sixteen.

   While the allocation of two out of the remaining twelve reserved
   label values in the space of about 12 years is not in itself a cause
   for concern, the scarcity of reserved labels is.  Furthermore, many
   of the reserved labels require special processing by forwarding
   hardware, changes to which are often expensive, and sometimes
   impossible.  Thus, documenting a newly allocated reserved label value
   is important.

   This memo outlines some of the issues in allocating and retiring
   reserved label values, and will eventually suggest mechanisms to
   address these.  Furthermore, this memo proposes a means of extending
   the space of reserved labels.

1.1.  Conventions used

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Questions

   1.  How should reserved labels be allocated?  The current IANA number
       space for "MPLS Label Values" has the allocation policy of "IETF
       Consensus".  Would "Expert Review" be better?  Should the name of
       this space be changed to reflect its use?  Should there be Early
       Allocation?  Experimental Use?  Private Use?

   2.  What documentation is required for reserved labels allocated
       henceforth?

   3.  Should a reserved label ever be retired?  What criteria are
       relevant here?  What procedures and time frames are appropriate?

   4.  The reserved label value of 3 is only used in signaling, never in
       the data plane.  Could it (and should it) be used in the data
       plane?  If so, how?

   5.  What is a feasible mechanism to extend the space of reserved
       labels, should this become necessary?

3.  Proposal

   To answer question 5 from the previous section, the following
   proposal is made: set aside label value 15 (the "extension" label)
   for the purpose of extending the space of reserved labels.  An
   extension label 15 MUST be followed by another label L (and thus MUST
   have the bottom-of-stack bit clear).  L MUST be interpreted as an
   "extended reserved label".  Furthermore, the interpretation and
   special processing of such labels MUST be documented, and they MUST
   be registered with IANA (policies TBD).

   A further question to be settled in this regard is whether a "plain"
   reserved label retains its meaning if it follows the extension label.
   That is, does a label value of 0 mean "Explicit IPv4 NULL" whether or
   not it is preceded by an extension label?  The suggestion here is
   "yes" for the currently allocated reserved labels (i.e., 0-3, 13, and
   14).  The documentation accompanying a newly allocated reserved label
   MUST say whether or not it retains its meaning if preceded by the
   extension label.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There is already an IANA registry for MPLS label values.  This memo
   may eventually suggest:

   1.  a change in the name of the registry to "Reserved MPLS Label
       Values

   2.  some changes to the procedures for allocating values

   3.  a new registry for "Extended Reserved MPLS Label Values".
