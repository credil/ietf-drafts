         Large-Scale Broadband Measurement Enterprise Use-Case
                draft-inacio-lmap-enterprise-use-case-00


Abstract

   The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working
   group is defining mechanisms to monitor network performance of large-
   scale networks.  The use case will describe how very large enterprise
   networks are not very different from the networks considered by other
   LMAP use cases and that most measurements are useful to both use
   cases.  In addition this use case will state the need for the ability
   to have finer grained observation related to User Experience
   potentially on a per application basis.

1  Introduction

   The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working
   group is charged with creating a uniform Information Model in order
   to measure large-scale network performance.  In addition to the
   Information Model, the working group is charged with creating a
   Control Protocol and a Report Protocol with their associated data
   models.

   The Information Model and associated Data Models necessary for
   monitoring and regulating Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks
   are closely shared with the monitoring of large scale enterprise
   networks.  In large scale enterprises, with multiple campuses
   distributed throughout countries or throughout the world, monitoring
   campus scale network activity and cross-campus network activity is
   closely related to monitoring ISP activity.

   The additional considerations for this large scale enterprise
   monitoring are the needs to be able to be able to make measurements
   aligned to enterprise applications and services beyond simple
   bandwidth and latency measurements.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].



2. Large Scale Enterprise Use Case

2.1 Similarities and Differences to ISPs and broadband users

   Many large scale enterprises centralized critical and/or expensive
   resources at a few select locations.  For example, login directory
   services due to their critical role in the infrastructure and
   security needs, email and calendaring systems, and certain accounting
   and human resource functions.  In large scale multinational
   organizations, these daily use resources may exist on a different
   continent then portions of the user base, with complex networks
   existing at both the remote location and where the critical resource
   is located.

   Users of these large scale networks have similar needs from their
   network providers (usually an internal sub-organization) that general
   broadband users expect from their ISP.  Depending on the
   organization, the service level agreement (SLA) may be more or less

   strict.  The users within these organizations have the same need to
   diagnose and verify the performance provided to them as broadband
   users.  Similarly, the sub-organization (referred to as IT
   (information technology) for the rest of this document) has the same
   need to test, measure, diagnose, and repair the network as a
   broadband ISP.

   The difference between the enterprise users and typical broadband
   users is their requirement for special SLAs for certain critical
   resources within their global corporate network.  Certain operations
   within the corporate network, when performing poorly at the global
   level, may have a disproportionate impact on the users experience
   when those SLAs are violated.  The second issue is that often the IT
   component within an enterprise is responsible for both application
   performance and network performance.

2.2 Additions for Enterprise Measurement

   Many large enterprises with geographically distributed resources
   partition their network monitoring related to geographic sub-units of
   the enterprise.  The lack of uniform measurement and models means
   that problems that occur across sites are often not solved without
   significant user pressure.

   The additional metrics necessary include the ability to distinguish
   application specific traffic flows in a passive manner and report on
   the performance end-to-end.  Combining this data with typical network
   performance data, nominally: bandwidth, latency, routing, etc. allows
   a fine grained view of network activity and resource utilization.

2.3 The Goal for Enhanced Measurement

   The goal of being able to measure the network in holistic ways that
   can be related to application experience is to answer the age old
   question:  Is it the network or the application?  By adding the
   ability to optionally measure in ways associated to application
   specific traffic, determining network impact to user experience will
   be possible.

3 Requirements

   * Passive monitoring of application related network measurements.

   * Non-averaged recording of application network data.

   * Ability to correlate application related network measurements to
   non-application related network measurements.

   * Ability to track, at possibly per-packet activity level,
   performance measurements of specific flows, possibly sampled

   * Ideally, a way for applications to announce themselves to the
   network for passive measurement.

   * Simple uniform methods (common ports, DPI) to inspect traffic to
   associate the traffic with application usage
