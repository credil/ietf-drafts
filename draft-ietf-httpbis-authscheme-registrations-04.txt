1.  Introduction

   This document registers Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   authentication schemes which have been defined in standards-track
   RFCs before the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was
   established.

2.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations related to the registration
   itself.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Appendix A provides initial registrations of HTTP authentication
   schemes for the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme registry at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes> (see Section 2.3
   of [draft-ietf-httpbis-p7-auth]).
