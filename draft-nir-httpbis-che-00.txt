              HTTP/2.0 Discussion: Compact Header Encoding
                        draft-nir-httpbis-che-00

Abstract

   This document proposes an alternative encoding for HTTP headers.
   This encoding is considerably more compact than the uncompressed
   textual encoding in HTTP/1.1 and current HTTP/2.0 draft.

Internet-Draft               compact-header                 October 2012


1.  Introduction

   HTTP/1.x and the current draft of HTTP/2.0 encode headers using text
   labels and text values.  HTTP/2.0 attempts to make this more
   efficient by compressing the textual headers.  This proposes a
   binary-only alternative.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  The Binary Encoding

   The header block is formatted as follows:

   +------------------------------------+
   |1|   version     |          8       |
   +------------------------------------+
   | Flags (8)  |   Length (24 bits)    |
   +------------------------------------+
   |X|          Stream-ID (31bits)      |
   +------------------------------------+
   |      Sequence of headers           |
   |                                    |
   +------------------------------------+

   The sequence of headers is just a list of the headers in one of 5
   formats:
   o  Flags - These are headers with no associated data.  The only
      information they convey is by their mere presence.
   o  Short Type-Value - where the header is associated with a 16-bit
      value.
   o  Long Type-Value - where the header is associated with a 32-bit
      value.
   o  Type-Length-Value - where the length is specified in the header.

   All formats include a 16-bit header identifier (see below), and those
   identifiers will be allocated through a new IANA registry (see
   Section 5).  The header identifier specifies which format applies.

Internet-Draft               compact-header                 October 2012


2.1.  Flags

   These headers are 16-bit numbers containing the header identifier.

   +-----------------+
   |header identifier|
   +-----------------+

2.2.  Short Type-Value

   These headers have the 16-bit identifier, and also the 16-bit value.

   +------------------------------------+
   |header identifier|  Value           |
   +------------------------------------+

2.3.  Long Type-Value

   These headers have the 16-bit identifier, and also a 32-bit value.

   +------------------------------------+
   |header identifier|    Value         |
   +-----------------+------------------+
   |  Value (cont)   |
   +-----------------+

2.4.  Type-Length-Value

   These headers have the 16-bit identifier, and also a 24-bit length
   field, and a value of variable length.

   +------------------------------------+
   |header identifier|    Length        |
   +---------+-------+------------------+
   | Length  | Value...                 |
   +---------+--------------------------+


3.  Header Encoding

   The encoding of each header is specified in the specification that
   describes it.  For convenience, this document describes some common
   encodings.  Specification writers SHOULD use these formats whenever
   they are appropriate.

   Unsigned integer numbers can be represented by either the short or
   long type-value, depending on their range.  Cache ages measured in
   seconds, such as in HSTS should use the long type-value, whereas a

Internet-Draft               compact-header                 October 2012


   header specifying an age in days should probably use a short type-
   value.  Either way, the encoding can be called "INT".

   Headers that hold an enumeration (such as Method) SHOULD use a short
   type-value, and SHOULD reserve one value (0xffff) for custom values.

   Time values should be encoded as strings using the RFC3339 format.

   Strings such as names should use the TLV format, and SHOULD be
   encoded as UTF-8.  String headers should be specified by their
   encoding, so "UTF8", or "ASCII".

   For headers with multiple values, the general format is always TLV,
   and the specification should list their type as either of three
   things:
   o  Short values - a list of 16-bit values
   o  Short strings - a sequence of strings, each prefixed by a 1-octet
      length field.
   o  Long strings - a sequence of strings, each prefixed by 1 2-octet
      length field.


4.  Custom Headers and Custom Enumerations

   For each type of header, a range will be allocated for experimental
   and custom headers.  To avoid collisions, we define here a special
   header to denote what kind of header this is.  The header is has
   identifier 49160 (0xC008), so it is TLV-formatted, and its value is
   formatted as follows:

   Custom header format

   +------------------------------------+
   |header identifier| Flags  | Name... |
   +---------+-------+------------------+

   For example, suppose draft-nir-httpbis-copyright-notice defines a
   header that contains a copyright notice for the content.  I will
   65530 (0xFFFA).  Note that the two headers don't have to be
   consecutive.  If the sender knows that the receiver recognizes this
   header with this identifier, the Custom header MAY be omitted.

     73 20 72 65 73 65 72 76 65 64 2e                |s reserved.     |

   For custom values in enumerations we define the Custom-Value header
   with identifier 49161 (0vC009), where the content is the string name
   of the custom value.  This header MUST follow the enumeration header.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to set up a new registry of header identifiers.
   The value is 16-bit, and the range is partitioned as follows:
   o  0-16383 - these values are allocated to flag headers, where the
      format is as in Section 2.1
   o  16384-32767 - these values are allocated to short type-value
      headers, where the format is as in Section 2.2
   o  32768-49151 - these values are allocated to long type-value
      headers, where the format is as in Section 2.3
   o  49152-65535 - these values are allocated to type-length-value
      headers, where the format is as in Section 2.4

   The ending quarter of each range shall be reserved for experimental
   and custom usage, and shall not be allocated by standards action.
   For example, the range 45056-49151 will be reserved for experimental
   and custom long type-value headers.


6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this draft.
