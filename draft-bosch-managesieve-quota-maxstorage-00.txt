          ManageSieve Protocol: QUOTA/MAXSTORAGE Response Code
              draft-bosch-managesieve-quota-maxstorage-00

Abstract

   This document defines the new QUOTA/MAXSTORAGE response code for the
   MangeSieve protocol.  It indicates that the total amount of storage
   occupied by the user's private Sieve scripts exceeds the site-defined
   quota constraint.

1.  Introduction

   Sieve [RFC5228] scripts allow users to filter incoming email.  Using
   the ManageSieve protocol [RFC5804], users can securely manage their
   Sieve scripts on a remote server.  This protocol allows a user to
   have multiple scripts on the server.  To limit the resources required
   for script storage and execution, the server may refuse to accept a
   newly uploaded script based on site-defined quota constraints.

   All queries from a ManageSieve client are replied to with either an
   OK, NO, or BYE response.  Each response may be followed by a response
   code to describe the event in a more detailed machine-parsable
   fashion (see [RFC5804], Section 1.3).  The ManageSieve protocol
   defines specific response codes to notify the client about exceeded
   quota.  The following quota response codes are currently defined:

   QUOTA               This generic response code is returned to
                       indicate that some unspecified quota is exceeded.
                       This is used when no more detailed response code
                       is applicable.

   QUOTA/MAXSIZE       This response code is returned when the size of
                       the currently uploaded script exceeds the limit.

   QUOTA/MAXSCRIPTS    This response code is returned when the number of
                       private scripts of this user exceeds the limit.

   This document defines a new quota response code that indicates that
   the total amount of storage occupied by the user's private Sieve
   scripts exceeds the site-defined quota constraint.


2.  The QUOTA/MAXSTORAGE Response Code

   This document defines the following new response code for ManageSieve
   ([RFC5804], Section 1.3):

   QUOTA/MAXSTORAGE

   If this response code is returned in the NO/BYE response, it means

   that the command would have placed the user above the site-defined
   limit on the total amount of storage occupied by the user's private
   Sieve scripts.  If this response code is returned in the OK response,
   it can mean that the user is near its quota or that the user exceeded
   its quota, but the server supports soft quotas.  This response code
   is a more specific version of the QUOTA response code defined in
   [RFC5804].

   This extends the ManageSieve ABNF ([RFC5804], Section 4) as follows:

   resp-code          =/ "QUOTA/MAXSTORAGE"
                ; resp-code is defined in [RFC5804]

4.  IANA Considerations

   The following requests IANA to register a new ManageSieve response
   code according to the IANA registration template specified in
   [RFC5804]:

   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: ManageSieve Response Code Registration

   Please register the following ManageSieve response code:

   Response Code: QUOTA/MAXSTORAGE
   Arguments (use ABNF to specify syntax, or the word NONE if none can
   be specified):  NONE
   Purpose:       If this response code is returned in the NO/BYE
                  response, it means that the command would have placed
                  the user above the site-defined limit on the total
                  amount of storage occupied by the user's private Sieve
                  scripts.  If this response code is returned in the OK
                  response, it can mean that the user is near its quota
                  or that the user exceeded its quota, but the server
                  supports soft quotas.  This response code is a more
                  specific version of the QUOTA response code.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in [RFC5804].  This document
   only registers a new response code for the ManageSieve protocol and
   as such it does not introduce any additional security concerns.
