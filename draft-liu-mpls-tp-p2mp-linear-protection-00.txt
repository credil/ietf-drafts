          Applicability of MPLS-TP Linear protection for p2mp
              draft-liu-mpls-tp-p2mp-linear-protection-00

Abstract

   In MPLS-TP requirement document(rfc5654), there is a requirement to
   support 1+1 and 1:n linear protection for p2mp connectivity.  The
   requirement was descirbled in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework
   document(RFC 6372).  The basic protocol for linear protection was
   specified in the MPLS-TP Linear Protection document [RFC 6378] but is
   limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection for p2p connectivity. in addtion,
   The 1:N protection in which all of working transport paths and the
   protection path have the same end points was specified in MPLS-TP 1:N
   protection document(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection).This document
   applies the existing PSC(RFC 6378) and extensive PSC
   protocol(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection) to support scenarios of
   protecting the p2mp path by extending the existing p2p linear
   protection mechanism. .


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP P2MP Linear protection       September 2012


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Requirement document(RFC5654) and
   MPLS-TP P2MP Framework document both describle the requirement that
   unidirectional 1+1 and 1:n protection for p2mp connectivity must be
   supported. while the MPLS-TP Survivability Framework(RFC6372) is a
   framework for survivability in MPLS-TP network.

   MPLS-TP Linear protection document(RFC6378) defines a Protection
   State Coordination(PSC) protocol that supports the different 1+1 and
   1:1 architectures descirbed in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework.  The
   PSC protocol is a single-phase protocol that allows the two endpoints
   of the protection domain to coordinate the protection switching
   operation domain to coordinate the protection switching operation
   when a switching condition is detected on the transport paths of the
   protection domain.

   MPLS-TP 1:N protection document(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection)
   uses a two-phase extensive PSC protocol to protect multiple working
   paths by a single protection path.

   As for the p2mp path, it has multiple leaf nodes and is still
   undirectional. so it is not good for p2mp path to use the protection
   mechnism in RFC6378 and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection. the
   document is an applicability of the existing PSC protocol and the
   extensive PSC protocol to support protection of p2mp path by
   extending the existing linear protection mechanism.

1.1.  1+1 p2mp protection

   This protection is a specific protection that use one designated
   protection path to protect one working path.  It is fully allocated
   in the sense that the route and bandwidth resource of the protection
   path is reserved for the working path.under any condition, the source
   root node will bridge both the working path and the protection path
   at the same time. while the sink leaf nodes will select one of the
   two paths to receive the traffic .  As it is unnecessary to
   coordinate the switch state between the root node and the leaf nodes
   , the PSC protocol is not needed in the 1+1 protection mechanism.

                                 Figure 1


   Figure 1 shows a protection domain with one working path and its
   corresponding protection path.for 1+1 protection, the protection path
   must transport the p2mp traffic at any time. so the source root node
   always bridges the p2mp traffic into both the working path and the
   protection path. while the sink leaf node L1 and L2 will select one
   of the two paths to receive the traffic based on the performance of
   the two paths.As it is no sense to coordinate the switch state
   between the source root node and the sink leaf nodes. it can't apply
   the PSC protocol for the protection mechanism;

1.2.  1:1 p2mp per-tree protection

   The protection will still use one designated p2mp protection path to
   protect one p2mp working path.but the source root node only bridges
   one of the two paths at any time.  All sink leaf nodes select the
   same p2mp path to receive the traffic. in addition, As the root node

   and leaf nodes need to coordinate to select the same p2mp path to
   send and receive the p2mp traffic. it may apply the existing PSC
   protocol to coordinate the switch state between the root node and the
   leaf nodes.

   just as the above figure 1, under normal condition, the traffic will
   be transported by only the working path from node r to node L1 and
   L2. when a defect is detected on the working path. the source node r
   will bridge the traffic into the p2mp protection path. then it should
   send PSC packet to all leaf nodes L1 and L2 in order to coordinate to
   select the p2mp protection path to send and receive the p2mp traffic.

1.3.  1:1 p2mp per-leaf protection

   The protection is similar to the above protection mechanism.it need
   to pre-configure one p2mp protection path to protect the p2mp working
   path. when a defect is detected on the working path.  The source root
   node firstly bridge both the working path and the protection path to
   send the traffic on both paths. while the leaf nodes will select one
   of the two paths to receive the traffic based on whether the working
   path has defect.As the source root node bridge two paths after a
   defect is detected on the working path, it is unnecessary to use PSC
   protocol to coordinate the switch state between the root node and the
   leaf nodes.

   just as the above figure 1,when a defect is detected on one branch
   path of the p2mp working path, for example, path(r-L1) or path(r-L2)
   has a defect, The source root node r will firstly send the traffic on
   both the working path and the protection path.  L1 or L2 will select
   one of the two path to receive the traffic based on whether to have a
   defect on its branch path(r-L1) or path(r-L2)..

1.4.  1:1 p2mp branch path protection

   The protection will pre-configure one p2p protection path to protect
   each branch path of the p2mp working path. and each branch path is
   disjointed from its p2p protection path. the protection mechanism is
   the same as 1:1 protection in MPLS-TP Linear protection(RFC3678), and
   it needs to use the PSC protocol to coordinate the switch state
   between the root node and the leaf nodes.

                                 Figure 2


   just as the above figure 2, firstly it pre-configures one p2p
   protection path for each branch path(r-L1) and (r-L2)
   individually.when a defect is detected on the branch path. the root
   node r will send PSC packet to its peer leaf node L1 or L2
   immediately , then switch into its p2p protection path to transport
   the traffic. while the leaf node L1 or L2 will select the protection
   path to receive the traffic .but for the protection mechnism, the
   more the leaf nodes are, the more its p2p protection paths are pre-
   configured.

1.5.  1:n p2mp shared protection

   The protection will pre-configure one p2mp shared protection path to
   protect multiple p2mp working paths which maybe have differnet end
   points. so the leaf nodes of the p2mp shared protection path are all
   leaf nodes of these protected p2mp working paths.when a defect is

   deteced on a working path, the root node of the protection path will
   send the existing extensive PSC protocol packet to its leaf nodes to
   identify which p2mp working path will be selected to be protected.
   when all the leaf nodes receive the PSC packet and decide how to
   process the traffic packet from the p2mp shared protection path.just
   as figure 3.

   the sink leaf nodes of the p2mp working path 2.so the leaf nodes of
   the p2mp shared protection path are node L1 , L2 and L3.when a defect
   is detected on both the working path 1 and the working path 2 at the
   same time.  The root node r of the p2mp shared protection path will
   select the higher priority working path to be protected. then it
   sends extensive PSC protocol packet to all leaf nodes L1,L2 and L3 by
   the p2mp shared protection path.Then the leaf nodes L1,L2 and L3 can
   judge whether to receive the traffic from the protection path based
   on the extensive PSC protocol packet.

3.  Coordination protocol

   Some protection mechanisms in this document need to PSC protocol to
   coordinate the switch state between the end-points of a protection
   domain. in order to gain to consistent solution for this coordination
   between the end-points of the protection domain. it will apply the
   existing PSC protocol to be defined in MPLS-TP Linear

Internet-Draft       MPLS-TP P2MP Linear protection       September 2012


   protection(RFC6378) in the 1:1 p2mp protection scenario including 1:1
   p2mp per-tree protection , 1:1 P2MP branch path protection.  The PSC
   protocol in detail maybe reference to the MPLS-TP linear
   protection(RFC6378). while 1:n shared p2mp protection may use the
   extensive PSC protocol defined in the MPLS-TP 1:N
   protection(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1ton-protection) to implement the
   protection.so the procedure of extensive PSC protocol maybe reference
   to the mpls-tp 1:N protection document. while the 1:n shared p2mp
   protection only use single-phase protocol which is different from the
   1:n protection for p2p path. so it is only non-locking operation and
   the value of L field can't be set. in addtion, it is unnecessary for
   the protection to wait for peer node's Acknowledge(WFA), so the
   parameter of WFA timer isn't necessary in this document.


4.  switch operation

   In all of the above protection mechanism, Firstly it must pre-
   configure protection path to protect one or multiple p2mp working
   path. then it detects whether to have a defect on the working path.
   if a defect is detected, then the end point of the p2mp working path
   will swich the traffic from the working path to the protection path

4.1.  1+1 protection operation

   The procedure of 1+1 protection operation is the following in detail:

   1 Under normal condition, the root node bridges the p2mp traffic into
   the working path and the protection path, while its leaf nodes will
   select the p2mp working path to receive the traffic.

   2 a defect is detected on the working path, some leaf nodes will
   select the protection path to receive the traffic which has defect on
   the branch path.

4.2.  1:1 p2mp per-tree protection operation

   The procedure of this protection switch is the following phase:

   1 under normal condition, the root node and leaf nodes will send and
   receive the traffic from the working path.the root node will send
   NR(0,0) to all leaf nodes by the protection path.

   2 when a defect is already detected on the working path, the root
   node will bridge from the working path to the protection path. then
   send SF(1,1) to all leaf nodes by the protection path.

   3 The leaf nodes receive the SF(1,1), All of them will switch into

   the protection path to receive the traffic.

4.3.  1:1 p2mp per-leaf protection operation

   The procedure of the protection is the following in detail:

   1 under normal condition, the root node will select the working path
   to send the traffic,and the leaf node select the working path to
   receive the traffic.

   2 when a defect is already detected on the branch path of the p2mp
   working path. the root node will bridge both the working path and the
   protection path . the sink node will select one of the two paths to
   receive the traffic based on whether a defect happens on the working
   path.

4.4.  1:1 p2mp branch path protection operation

   The procedure of the protection operation is the following in detail:

   1 under normal condition, the root node and all leaf nodes will
   select the p2mp working path to send and receive the traffic. and the
   root node sends NR(0,0) to each leaf node by its p2p protection path.

   2 when a defect is detected on a branch path of the p2mp working
   path, The root node will bridge the traffic into its corresponding
   p2p protection path and send SF(1,1) to the leaf node of the branch
   path.

   3 The leaf node receives the SF(1,1) packet, then it will switch from
   the working path to the p2p protection path to receive the
   traffic.other leaf nodes will still receive the traffic from the
   working path.

4.5.  1:n p2mp shared protection operation

   the procedure of this protection operation is the following :

   1 Under normal condition, the root node and all leaf nodes will
   select the p2mp working path to send and receive the traffic, the
   root node sends NR(0,0) to all leaf nodes of the p2mp protection path
   periodcally.

   2 a defect is detected on one or multiple p2mp working path , the
   root node will select the highest priority working path to be
   protected.and send SF(n,n) to all the leaf nodes of the protection
   path.here n indicates the index of the p2mp working path to be
   protected.at the same time, the root node begin to send the traffic

   to be selected on the p2mp shared protection path.

   3 when all leaf nodes of the p2mp shared protection path receive the
   SF(n,n) packet. they will know whether or not to receive the traffic
   from the p2mp shared protection path based on SF(n,n) packet. if a
   node is a leaf node of the p2mp working path to be protected, it will
   receive the traffic , or not, it directly abandon the traffic from
   the p2mp shared protection path.
