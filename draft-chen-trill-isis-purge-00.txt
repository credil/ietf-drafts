   Extension to Purge Initiator Identification TLV for ISIS in TRILL
                     draft-chen-trill-isis-purge-00

Abstract

   This memo specified an extension of ISIS TLV for identifying purge
   initiator in TRILL environments.  With the extension, it's beneficial
   for operators to nail down the root cause when there is a corrupted
   LSP spread within a layer-2 network.  The defined TLV is expected to
   record the system ID, Nickname and impacted VLAN information.
   RBridge should propagate the TLV information without changes in order
   to flood the information.

1.  Introduction

   It's a increasing demand to build a flexible layer 2 network within a
   data center network.  TRILL was created to provide optimum point-to-
   point forwarding automatically by performing layer 2 customer
   bridging with ISIS link state routing.  Multi-pathing has been
   supported for both unicast and multi-destination traffic through
   extension of ISIS in TRILL contexts.  It's required that TRILL
   implements a separate IS-IS instance from any used by Layer 3, that
   is, different from the one used by routers.[RFC6325].  Layer 3 IS-IS
   frames must be distinguished from TRILL IS-IS frames even when those
   Layer 3 IS-IS frames are transiting an RBridge campus.

   [RFC6232]specified Purge Originator Identification(POI) TLV for Layer
   3 IS-IS frames, which could provide significant signals to facilitate
   trouble-shooting.  Some of TRILL specific extension of TLV have been
   defined in[RFC6165] [RFC6326].It's desirable to make Layer 2 IS-IS to
   be able to identify the purge initiator with a distinct indicator
   compared to POI.  In addition, several identification information has
   been introduced in TRILL protocol, e.g. nickname of RBridge and VLAN.
   Those information is likely useful to identify the corrupted source
   in a large layer 2 network.  It's worthwhile to map those Layer 3
   feature into Layer 2.  This memo specified the extension of ISIS TLV
   for identifying purge initiator in TRILL environments.  With the
   extension, it's beneficial for operators to nail down the root cause
   when there is a corrupted LSP spread within a layer-2 network.  The
   defined TLV is expected to record the system ID, Nickname and
   impacted VLAN information.  RBridge should propagate the TLV
   information without changes in order to flood the information.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  The Purge Initiator Identification TLV

   In order to trace the source of purge, the document defined the Purge
   Initiator Identification(PII) TLV for Layer 2 ISIS system.  If an
   RBridge receives a corrupted LSP and generates purge message, it
   SHOULD include this TLV with its own system ID, nickname and optional
   VLAN information.  If an RBridge receives a purge that does not
   include this TLV, then it SHOULD add this TLV with both its own
   system ID, nickname, optional VLAN and the system ID of the RBridge
   that it received the purge from.  This allows RBridges receiving

   purges to log the identification of the initiator.  This makes it
   much easier for the network administrator to locate the origin of the
   purge and thus the cause of the purge.

   The PII TLV is ISIS TLV type 146 and has the following format:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Type= PII     |                  (1 byte)
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   Length      |                  (1 byte)
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  RESV |      VLAN-ID          |  (2 bytes)
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   Value       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   Nickname                    |  (2 bytes)
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                          SystemID (1)       (7 bytes             |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                      .................                           |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: TLV Type, set to 146 (PII).

   o  LENGTH - total length of the value field.

   o  RESV: (4 bits) MUST be sent as zero and ignored on
      receipt.(optional)

   o  VLAN-ID: This carries a 12-bit VLAN identifier that is to idenfity
      PII is relevant to a specific VLAN.(optional)

   o  Value: Number of entity information(including System ID and
      Nickname) carried in this TLV (1 octet) -- only the values 1 and 2
      are defined.

   o  Nickname: If Value is set to 1, Nickname of the Intermediate
      System that inserted this TLV has been included.  If Value is set
      to 2, Nickname of the Intermediate System from which the purge was
      received have also been included (optional).

   o  System ID: If Value is set to 1, System ID of the Intermediate
      System that inserted this TLV has been included.  If Value is set
      to 2, System ID of the Intermediate System from which the purge
      was received have also been included (optional).

4.  Security Considerations

   For general TRILL protocol security considerations, see the TRILL
   base protocol standard [RFC6325].  IS-IS security may be used to
   secure the IS-IS messages discussed here.  In that case, some of
   considerations could be found in [RFC6232]


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned code point 146 for the 'Purge Initiator
   Identification' TLV from the IS-IS 'TLV Codepoints' registry.  The
   additional values for this TLV should be IIH:n, LSP:y, SNP:n.
