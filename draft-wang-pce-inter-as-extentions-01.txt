1.  Introduction

   Requirements for establishing Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic
   Engineering (MPLS-TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that cross multiple
   Autonomous Systems (ASes) are described in [RFC4216].  As described
   in [RFC4216], a method SHOULD provide the ability to compute a path
   spanning multiple ASes.  So a path computation entity that may be the
   head-end Label Switching Router (LSR), an AS Border Router (ASBR), or
   a Path Computation Element [PCE] needs to know the TE information not
   only of the links within an AS, but also of the links that connect to
   other ASes.

   As described in [RFC5392], two new LSAs are defined to advertise
   inter-AS TE information for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 separately, and three
   new sub-TLVs are added to the existing Link TLV to carry the
   information about the neighboring AS and the remote ASBR.  [RFC5316]
   defines similar extensions for [ISIS].

   In order for bidirection path computation, PCE needs to get
   bidirection Inter-AS TE link information.  [RFC5392] introduces a
   "proxy" for the ASBR at the edge of the other AS and generate a
   bidirection TE link.

   This document extends BRPC in order to support the bidirection path
   computation within single procedure.  Based on the mechanism in this
   document, we don't need to introduce the 'proxy'.  It shows how the
   Backward-Recursive PCE-Based Computation (BRPC) - procedures for
   Inter-AS TE Links can be extended in order for deriving the optimum
   end-to-end bidirection path.

   This document does not propose or define any mechanisms to advertise
   any other extra-AS TE information within IGP.

3.  Introduction

3.1.  Inter-AS Information Advertised by IGP

   As mentioned in [RFC5392] and [RFC5316], Hellos MUST NOT be exchanged
   over the Inter-AS TE link, and consequently, an IGP adjacency MUST
   NOT be formed.

   In the current operation of TE IGP, the LSRs at each end of a TE link
   emit LSAs describing the link.  The databases in the LSRs then have
   two entries (one locally generated, the other from the peer) that
   describe the different 'directions' of the link.  This enables
   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) to do a two-way check on the
   link when performing path computation and eliminate it from
   consideration unless both directions of the link satisfy the required
   constraints.

   In the case we are considering here (i.e., of a TE link to another
   AS), there is, by definition, no IGP peering and hence no bidirection
   TE link information.

   The information advertised comes from the ASBR's knowledge of the
   unidirection TE capabilities of the link, the ASBR's knowledge of the



Xuerong Wang, et al.    Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      BRPC Ext. for Inter-AS Bidir. LSP          July 2011


   unidirection current status and usage of the link, and configuration
   at the ASBR of the remote AS number and remote ASBR TE Router ID.

   For other properties, e.g., bandwidth and metrics, an ASBR is
   difficult or impossible to get the latest value of these properties
   about reverse directional of Inter-AS TE links timely.  In order for
   the CSPF route computation entity to include the link as a candidate
   path, we have to find a way to solve this problem.

3.2.  Backward Recursive Path Computation

   The Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) [RFC5441] procedure
   involves cooperation and communication between PCEs in order to
   compute an optimal end-to-end path across multiple domains.  Each PCE
   creates a tree of potential paths from every entry BN to the LSP
   destination (the Virtual Shortest Path Tree - VSPT) and passes this
   back to the previous PCE in a PCRep.  Each PCE in turn adds to the
   VSPT and passes it back until the PCE in the source domain uses the
   VSPT to select an end-to-end path .

   In the case of inter-domain LSP computation, PCE(i)(i=n-1 to 2) also
   requires adding the inter-AS TE links that connect the domain(i) and
   the domain(i+1).

3.3.  Problem Statement

   Following scenarios illustrate the problem.

   Case 1: Inter-AS link failed in only one direction

                            A---B1---- C1---Z
                             \   |     |   /
                              \  |     |  /
                               \ |     | /
                                B2---- C2
                                     :
                            <--AS1-->:<-- AS2-->

                        Figure 1: multi-AS network

   Considering multi-AS network shown in Figure 1,PCE1 responsible for
   the computation of AS1, and PCE2 responsible for the computation of
   AS2 .  Bidirection Inter-AS link between B1 and C1 consists of two
   unidirectional inter-AS links, one is from B1 to C1,another is from
   C1 to B1.  For the inter-AS links do not exchange IGP information,
   PCE1 and PCE2 seperately have the TE properties of one direction of a
   bidirection inter-AS link.

   As described in RFC5441: In the case of inter-domain LSP computation,
   PCE(i)(i=n-1 to 2) also requires adding the inter-AS TE links that
   connect the domain(i) and the domain(i+1).

   For unidirection LSP computation from A to Z: Because PCE1 has the TE
   properties in one direction (i.e.,B1-->C1, B2-->C2) of the inter-AS
   links, PCE1 knows which inter-AS link can be added.  So PCE1 can
   compute LSP within AS1 attached add the unidirectional inter-AS links
   that connect AS1 to AS2 (i.e., B1-->C1, B2-->C2).

   For bidirection LSP computation from A to Z : Suppose the inter-AS
   link fails in one direction( e.g. ,from C1 to B1), Which inter-AS
   link should be selected for the bidirectional path?  Obviously, PCE1
   can't select proper inter-AS TE links without any enough information.

   Case 2: bandwidth of bidirection inter-AS link is different in two
   directions

                              Z1          A1
                                \        /
                                 B------C
                                /        \
                              A2          Z2
                                     :
                            <--AS1-->:<--AS2-->

                    Figure 2: multi-AS MPLS-TP network

   Figure 2 shows a multi-AS MPLS-TP network, where AS1 and AS2 are
   MPLS-TP networks.  PCE1 and PCE2 are responsible for the computation
   of corresponding AS.

   Suppose unidirection LSP along A1-C-B-Z1 have already been setup, and
   bandwidth has been reserved for the LSP.  For the inter-AS link
   between B and C, bandwidth of link that is from B to C is not the
   same as that is from C to B. If we want to create a co-routed
   bidirection LSP from A2 to Z2, suppose bandwidth of inter-AS link
   only satisfy the constraints in one direction.  Neither PCE1 nor PCE2
   knows which bidirectional inter-AS link could be select.

   Case 3: multi-inter-AS links connect to one ASBR

                         <-- AS1 -->:<---- AS2 --->

            Figure 3: multi-inter-AS links connect to one ASBR


   Suppose unidirectional inter-AS link from C1 to B1 doesn't satisfy
   the constraints.  As previous case shown in figure1, there is only
   one inter-AS link connect to each ASBR node.  PCE2 has the ability to
   check that unidirectional inter-AS link from C1 to B1 does not
   satisfy the constraints, and then it can simply delete the path C1 to
   Z from VSPT and only passes path C2 to Z in PCRep to PCE2 .  But if
   there are more than one inter-AS links connected to one ASBR, and not
   all of the unidirectional inter-AS links don't satisfy the
   constraints, there still be some problem:

   In figure 3, there are more than one inter-AS links connected to one
   ASBRs.  Suppose a bidirectional LSP from A to Z is going to be
   created and only unidirectional inter-AS link from C1 to B1 doesn't
   satisfy the constraints.VSPT computed by PCE2 consists of two paths:
   C1 to Z and C2 to Z. So in figure 3, PCE1 can not delete the path C1
   to Z from VSPT.  Similarly,How can PCE1 or PCE2 know which inter-AS
   links to select?


4.  Solutions of Inter-AS bidirectional path computation

4.1.  Extensions of Backward-Recursive PCE-Based Computation (BRPC)

   As described in RFC5441: In the case of inter-domain LSP computation,
   PCE(i)(i=n-1 to 2) also requires adding the inter-AS TE links that
   connect the domain(i) and the domain(i+1).The problem about Inter-AS
   TE links described in previous section focus on : In the case of
   bidirection LSP computation, if PCE adds the inter-AS TE links ,it
   must know which of the inter-AS links that can be added.

   In our solution, PCE can select inter-AS links that satisfy the
   constraints and carry them in the computing reply message(Specially
   in case3 shown in previous section, PCE2 must let PCE1 know which
   unidirection inter-AS link satisfy the constraints).

   With the following extensions of BRPC procedure we can get these
   proper inter-AS TE links for the bidirection LSP:



Xuerong Wang, et al.    Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      BRPC Ext. for Inter-AS Bidir. LSP          July 2011


   o  After computing the shortest constrained paths(i.e., VSPT) between
      every entry BN and the TE LSP destination, PCE(i+1) selects the
      Inter-AS TE links from AS(i+1) to AS(i) that satisfy the
      constraints and passes them back to the PCE(i) in a PCRep.

   o  Then, the PCE(i) can choose among the Inter-AS TE links carried in
      received PCRep message that satisfy the constraints in the reverse
      direction ,and compute the shortest constrained paths between
      every exit BN and the TE LSP destination.

   Following is the extended BRPC procedure:

   o  Step 1:

      First, the PCC needs to determine the PCE capable of serving its
      path computation request (this can be done with local
      configuration or via IGP discovery (see [RFC5088] and [RFC5089])).
      The path computation request is then relayed until reaching a
      PCE(n) such that the TE LSP destination resides in the domain(n).
      This step is the same as described in [RFC5441].

   o  Step 2:

      2.1.  PCE(n) computes the list of shortest constrained paths
      between every BN-en(j,n) and the TE LSP destination;

      2.2.  PCE(n) selects the Inter-AS TE links that satisfy the
      constraints from all of the Inter-AS TE links that provide
      connectivity from domain (n) to domain(n-1);

      2.3.  PCE(n) returns PCRep (including result of 2.1 and 2.2) to
      PCE(n-1).

      Note that for unidirection LSP computation, step 2.2 may not be
      performed.

   o  Step i:

      For i=n-1 to 2: {

      i.1.  With the Inter-AS TE links returned from PCE(i+1), PCE(i)
      chooses the links that satisfy the constraints in the reverse
      direction(i.e., the selected Inter-AS TE links satisfy the
      required constraints in both of the directions.)

      i.2.  PCE(i) computes the shortest constrained paths between each
      BN-en(j,i) and the TE LSP destination; PCE(i)(i=n-1 to 2) requires
      adding the inter-AS TE links that concluded by i.1.

Internet-Draft      BRPC Ext. for Inter-AS Bidir. LSP          July 2011


      i.3.  PCE(i) selects the Inter-AS TE links that unidirectionally
      satisfy the constraints from all of the Inter-AS TE links that
      provide connectivity from domain (i) to domain(i-1);

      i.4.  PCE(i) returns PCRep (including result of i.2 and i.3) to
      PCE(i-1). }

      Note that for unidirection LSP computation, step i.1, and i.3 may
      not be performed.

   o  Step n:

      n.1.  With the Inter-AS TE links returned from PCE(2), PCE(1)
      chooses the links that satisfy the constraints in the reverse
      direction (i.e., the selected Inter-AS TE links satisfy the
      required constraints in both of the directions.);

      n.2.  PCE(1) computes the end-to-end shortest constrained path.
      PCE(1) requires adding the inter-AS TE links that concluded by
      n.1.

      Note that for unidirection LSP computation, step n.1. may not be
      performed.

   Note that uni-direction represents the direction from entry BNs of
   local domain i to exit BNs of domain i-1, the reverse direction
   represents the direction from exit BNs of local domain i to entry BNs
   of domain i+1.

4.2.  Extensions of PCEP

   As described in RFC5440, if the path computation request can be
   satisfied, the set of computed paths specified by means of Explicit
   Route Objects (EROs) is inserted in the PCRep message.In the scenario
   of inter-domain path computation using BRPC procedure,the ERO
   represents the VSPT, i.e.,the paths satisfy the constraints between
   every entry BN and the LSP destination.

   For the following reasons, a new object CRO (see 4.2.3) is introdued
   to represent the inter-AS links:

   o  l For the bidirection LSP solution introduced in this document,
      the inter-AS links carried in PCRep satisfy the constraints only
      in one direction.  These inter-AS links only partially satisfy the
      constraints, and wait for neighbor PCE to confirm the constraints
      in reverse direction.  These partially confirmed inter-AS links
      are not the compute results and only used to notify neighbor PCE
      to confirm.  So the inter-AS links carried in PCRep need to



Xuerong Wang, et al.    Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      BRPC Ext. for Inter-AS Bidir. LSP          July 2011


      differentiate from ERO that represents the computation result.

   o  To include inter-AS links by ERO needs to stitch VSPT and inter-AS
      links.  In the case there are more than one inter-AS links connect
      to one ASBR, e.g., in figure 3, ERO C1--Z represent the path from
      the ASBR C1 to the destination Z. Suppose both of the two inter-AS
      links C1--B1 and C1--B2 satisfy the constraints, then maybe we
      need to copy C1--Z to two EROs, one stitchs inter-AS link B1--C1,
      the other stitchs inter-AS link B2--C1.  So there maybe some
      repeated information.

4.2.1.  IVSPT flag

   PCEP needs to be introduced a new flag in RP object carried within
   the PCReq message (defined in [RFC5440]).  The PCE(i) set this flag
   in PCReq to indicates that the Inter-AS TE links from AS(i+1) to
   AS(i) satisfying the constraints must be return.  In other words, the
   PCE(i) requests the computation of an inter-domain TE LSP using the
   new BRPC procedure defined in this document, and Inter-AS TE links
   from AS(i+1) to AS(i) satisfying the constraints must be included in
   PCRep.

   The following new flag of the RP object is defined:

   IVSPT Flag

            Bit Number    Name Flag
            -------       ------
            TBD           IVSPT

4.2.2.  BRPC Procedure Completion Failure

   If PCE(i) send IVSPT flag to PCE(i+1) who doesn't recognizes the
   IVSPT flag of RP object, PCE(i+1) MUST generate PCErr message with an
   Error-Type=4 (Not supported object), Error-value=4 (Unsupported
   parameter).  The PCE may include the parent object (RP object) up to
   and including (but no further than) the unknown or unsupported
   parameter.  In this case where the unknown or unsupported parameter
   is a bit flag (IVSPT flag), the included RP object should contain the
   whole bit flag field with all bits after the parameter at issue set
   to zero.  The corresponding path computation request is then
   cancelled by the PCE without further notification.

   If PCE(i) send IVSPT flag to PCE(i+1) who recognizes IVSPT flag of RP
   object but does not support the new BRPC procedure extended in this
   document, it MUST return a PCErr message to the upstream PCE with an
   Error-Type " Enhanced BRPC procedure unsupported".

   The PCErr message MUST be relayed to the requesting PCC.

   PCEP-ERROR objects are used to report a PCEP protocol error and are
   characterized by an Error-Type that specifies the type of error and
   an Error-value that provides additional information about the error
   type.  Both the Error-Type and the Error-value are managed by IANA.

   A new Error-Type is defined that relates to the BRPC procedure.

       Error-Type       Meaning
       --------         -------
       TBD              Enhanced BRPC procedure unsupported

                        Error-value
                          1   Enhanced  BRPC procedure not supported
                               by one or more PCEs along the domain path

4.2.3.  Inter-AS TE links carried in PCEP message

   For the bidirection Inter-AS TE LSP BRPC procedure referenced in this
   document, PCE(n) should select the unidirection Inter-AS TE links
   that satisfy the constraints from all of the Inter-AS TE links that
   provide connectivity from domain (n) to domain(n-1),and then PCE(n)
   should return the selected Inter-AS TE links in PCRep message.

   We introduce a new object (Inter-AS Virtual Shortest Path Tree
   -IVSPT) to carry the selected Inter-AS TE links (see 4.2.3.1.).

4.2.3.1.  Definition of IVSPT(i)

   Mode of BRPC Operation is introduced in [RFC 5441]:

   Definition of VSPT(i)

   In each domain i:

   o  Step 1: There is a set of X-en(i) entry BNs noted BN-en(k,i) where
      BN-en(k,i) is the kth entry BN of domain(i).

   o  There is a set of X-ex(i) exit BNs noted BN-ex(k,i) where BN-
      ex(k,i) is the kth exit BN of domain(i).

   VSPT(i): MP2P (multipoint-to-point) tree returned by PCE(i) to
   PCE(i-1):

                         /        |          \
                   BN-en(1,i)   BN-en(2,i) ... BN-en(j,i).

                       where [X-en(i)] is the number of
                   entry BNs in domain i and j<= [X-en(i)]

                            Figure 4: MP2P VSPT


   Each link of tree VSPT(i) represents the shortest constrained path
   between BN-en(j,i) and the TE LSP destination that satisfies the set
   of required constraints for the TE LSP (bandwidth, affinities,
   etc.).These are path segments to reach the TE LSP destination from
   BN-en(j,i).

   Note that PCE(i) only considers the entry BNs of domain(i), i.e.,
   only the BNs that provide connectivity from domain(i-1).

   Besides VSPT, this document defines Inter-AS Virtual Shortest Path
   Tree (IVSPT) used for describing unidirection Inter-AS paths whose
   direction is from AS(i) to AS(i-1).

   Definition of IVSPT(j,i) :

   IVSPT(j,i): jth MP2P (multipoint-to-point) tree returned by PCE(i) to
   PCE(i-1)

     BN-ex(1,i-1)  BN-ex(2,i-1) ... BN-ex(kj,i-1).

   where
     [X-en(i)] is the number of entry BNs in domain i and j<= [X-en(i)],
     [Y-ex(i-1)] is the number of exit BNs in domain i-1
     and k1,k2,...,kj<= [X-ex(i-1)]


                              Figure 5: IVSPT

   IVSPT(j,i) represents the Inter-AS paths from BN-en(j,i) of domain i
   to exit BNs of domain i-1 that satisfies the set of required
   constraints for the TE LSP (bandwidth, affinities, etc.).

4.2.3.2.  Constrain Route Object(CRO)

   The CRO is used to encode the Inter-AS paths that satisfies the set
   of required constraints for the TE LSP.

   The CRO is carried within a PCRep message to provide the selected
   Inter-AS links if the path computation was successful.

   The contents of this object are identical to the contents of the
   RSVP-TE ERO defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473], and [RFC3477].  That is,
   the object is constructed from a series of sub-objects.  Any RSVP-TE
   ERO sub-object already defined or that could be defined in the future
   for use in the RSVP-TE ERO is acceptable in this object.

4.2.3.3.  IVSPT Encoding

   The IVSPT is returned within a PCRep message.  The encoding consists
   of a non-ordered list of Constrain Route Objects (CROs) where each
   CRO represents an Inter-AS link that satisfy the required constraint
   from domain i to domain i+1.

           Example:

                   R1------R3----R5-----R7------R9-----R11---- R13
                           | \   | \     |     / |             /
                           |  \  |   \   |  ---- |  ----------
                           |   \ |     \ | /     | /
                   R2------R4----R6-----R8------R10----R12
                              :              :
                   <-- AS1 -->:<---- AS2 --->:<------- AS3 --------->

             Figure 7: An Example of Inter-AS path computation

   In the example shown in Figure 7, if we make the assumption that a
   constrained path exists between each ABR and the destination R13, the
   VSPT computed by a PCE(3) serving AS 3 consists of the following non-
   ordered set of EROs:

   o  ERO1: R9(TE Router ID)-R11(Interface IP address)-R13(TE Router ID)

   o  ERO2: R10(TE Router ID)-R13(TE Router ID)

   If we make the assumption that Inter-AS links R9-->R7 ,R9-->R8 and
   R10-->R8 satisfy the required constraints, the IVSPT selected by a
   PCE(3) serving AS 3 consists of the following non-ordered set of
   CROs:

   o  CRO1: R9(Interface IP address),R7(TE Router ID)

   o  CRO2: R9(Interface IP address),R8(TE Router ID)

   o  CRO3: R10(Interface IP address),R8(TE Router ID)

   TBD.
