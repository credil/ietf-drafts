                PCP Support for Nested NAT Environments
                     draft-penno-pcp-nested-nat-03

Abstract

   Nested NATs or multi-layer NATs are already widely deployed.  They
   are characterized by two or more NAT devices in the path of packets
   from the subscriber to the Internet.  Moreover, NAT devices current
   deployed are PCP unaware and It is assumed that NAT aware PCP devices
   will take a long time to be rolled out.  Therefore in order to lower
   the adoption barrier of PCP and make it work for current deployed
   networks, this document proposes a few mechanisms for PCP-enabled
   applications to work through NATs with varying levels of PCP protocol
   support.

1.  Introduction

   Nested NATs are widely deployed and come in different topology
   flavors.  It could be a home subscriber which has an ISP provided NAT
   CPE chained with another personal NAT router.  It could be an ISP
   provided CPE chained with a CGN.

   An example of the use of the proposed options is illustrated in the
   following figure where there is a NAT in the path between the PCP
   Client and the PCP Server.

                  webcam-------+
                               |
               +----------+    |    +----+         +----------+
               |PCP Client|====+====|NAT1|=========|PCP Server|
               +----------+         +----+         |   NAT2   |
                                                   +----------+

   An example of instructing mappings in the PCP Server is as follows:

   o  NAT1 is detected in the path between the PCP Client and the PCP
      Server owing to the use of the RECEIVED_SOURCE_IP_PORT Option and the returned
      IP address (IP Header) of PCP request in PCP response;

   o  After learning about that NAT, the PCP Client uses UPnP IGD,
      NAT-PMP or manual configuration to interact with NAT1 and
      open the necessary port on NAT1 (e.g., IP address= IPx, port=X);

   o  The PCP Client then sends PCP message to the PCP Server,
      indicating IPx and X as the internal IP address and port.  The PCP
      Server opens pinhole towards IPx and X.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses PCP terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]].

1.2.  Problem Statement

   The current NAT deployed devices will take years to be replaced or
   upgraded to become PCP aware.  Moreover, nested NATs are common and
   come in a variety of flavors (examples below).  Therefore, as
   applications become PCP enabled, it is important that they can work
   through nested NAT networks as is, without requiring infrastructure
   changes.  From the point of view of a PCP-enabled application running
   on an end host, the core problem is common across different nested
   NAT topologies: how to install PCP mappings in a nested NAT scenario
   where the different NATs in the path have varying level of PCP
   protocol support.

1.3.  Scope

   This proposal considers the discovery of the PCP Server out of scope.
   Nonetheless, it s a critical piece of PCP deployment in service
   provider networks.


2.  PCP MAP Nested NAT Methods

   There are a few methods to make PCP work through nested NATs.  They
   differ mainly based on the level of support that can be expected from

   intermediate NATs, which can be:

   o  PCP and UPnP unaware or disabled

   o  PCP Server

   o  UPnP Server

   o  PCP Proxy

   The next sections discuss each scenario on the basis of protocol
   support on intermediate NATs.

2.1.  PCP and UPnP unaware Intermediate NATs

   This method will most likely be used by PCP clients in nested NAT
   environments while PCP Proxy support in not ubiquitous.  It assumes
   no UPnP or PCP Proxy support on intermediate NATs.  This proposal
   leverages the current behavior of PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] which
   allows a PCP Client and Server to detect intervening nested NATs.
   The PCP Server uses the information on the outer IP and PCP headers
   to detect and install a proper NAT mapping and return the source IP:
   port from the IP header on the PCP response.  It does not assume any
   change to current deployed NATs.

   1.  The PCP Client sends the MAP request as it normally would without
       any changes.

   2.  As the message goes through one (or more) PCP-unaware NAT, the
       source IP:port of the IP header will change accordingly

   3.  The PCP Server compares the PCP Client IP:port in the PCP header
       with the source IP:port of the IP header

   4.  If these are different, the server knows that the PCP message
       went through a PCP-unaware NAT.  Therefore it installs a mapping
       directed to the source IP address found on the IP header and
       internal port of the PCP header.

   - Subscriber installs a port forwarding or DMZ entry on its home CPE
   (PCP U-NAT) through manual configuration.  The entry would be (*,
   40000) -> (10.0.0.1, 40000).  Alternatively the application could use
   UPnP for the same purpose.

2.2.  PCP Server intermediate NAT

   If the intermediate NAT implements a PCP Server (but not a Proxy), a
   two-step iterative process is needed in order to install PCP PEER
   mappings for the PCP control message itself followed by another PCP
   mapping for the data path.  If the PCP Client Address does not match
   the IP address of IP header, PCP Server (CGN) will reject request
   with ADDRESS_MISMATCH error.  Therefore PCP Client first needs to
   know the IP address and port the CPE NAT will use for the actual PCP
   request to CGN.

   If the PCP client relies on nested NAT detection the first step is
   not needed.  It is assumed that before sending the PCP MAP request to
   the CGN the client would install the following map on the NAT Home
   Gateway: (192.168.0.2, 40000) <- (10.0.0.2, 40000).  The internal
   port that the server listens on does not necessarily needs to be
   40000, it could be different than the internal port used between the
   CGN and CPE.

   The drawback of this technique is that there is no obvious way for
   the PCP Client to know the PCP Servers downstream.  One possibility
   is for each PCP Server in the path to return the address of the
   upstream PCP Server to the PCP Client.

2.3.  UPnP enabled intermediate NAT

   This scenario is very similar to the PCP Server intermediate NAT, but
   the CPE implements a UPnP Server instead of PCP Server.  The
   mechanics are the same with the difference that first PEER message to
   setup the PCP Control messages mapping is substituted by its UPnP
   equivalent.

2.4.  PCP Proxy Intermediate NAT

   This method assumed that the intermediate NATs implement a PCP Proxy
   function.  There are two non-exclusive types of proxy functions:
   interception (ALG) and server-client based.  In the interception case
   the PCP Proxy intercepts PCP messages destined to a PCP Server
   downstream, modifies IP, UDP and PCP headers, allocates a mapping and
   send them to the downstream PCP Server.  Ideally if the interception
   PCP Proxy also implements a PCP server it would let the PCP Client

   know of its existence in a PCP response through an option (TBD) and
   henceforth the PCP Client would start directing messages to it.

   In the server-client scenario the PCP Client sends PCP messages to
   the proxy which acts as both PCP Server and Client.  This proxy in
   turn will terminate the PCP request and generate a new one acting as
   a PCP Client to its own PCP Server.  Therefore mappings are installed
   in all NAT devices in a recursive manner.  This is the recommended
   method since its does not need a special discovery procedure and
   works with any number of NATs.  More information about this method
   can be found in [I-D.bpw-pcp-proxy].

2.4.1.  PCP Proxy Discovery

   TBD


3.  PCP PEER Nested NAT Methods

   All techniques discussed for PCP MAP methods do not work for PCP PEER
   messages.  PCP PEER is a different beast and another set of
   techniques need to be used to overcome intervening NATs.  The
   critical issue related to PEER is that the client needs to know the
   external source port NAT1 will use to translate packets for the
   actual data session.  There are two scenarios to consider: send-then-
   connect and connect-then-send.

3.1.  Send-then-connect

   In this scenario the client sends a PEER message to install a mapping
   which later will be used by a regular UDP or TCP data session.  In
   order for this to work reliably, the following procedure needs to the
   followed:

   1.  PCP Client needs to allocate a binding on the intervening NAT
       thorugh STUN, UPnP or other method.  Let's suppose this binding
       is (192.168.0.2, 19216 <-> 10.0.0.2, 10002).

   2.  PCP Client constructs a PCP PEER request like the following

       *  Internal port: 10002

       *  Remote Peer Port: 20002 (upcoming data connection destination
          port)

       *  Remote Peer address: 20.0.0.2 (upcoming data connection
          destination IP address)

Internet-Draft              penno-nested-nat                January 2013


       *  PCP Client Address: 10.0.0.2

       *  Protocol: TCP

   3.  Application will connect to remote peer using the same source IP
       address and port of the existing mapping on the intervening NAT.
       If the intervening NAT supports Protocol Independent Endpoint
       Independent Mapping (PI-EIM)
       [I-D.penno-behave-rfc4787-5382-5508-bis] , it will allocate the
       same external IP:port of step 1 to the new connection.  Therefore
       5-tuple of the new connection will match those of the previously
       installed PEER map.

3.2.  Connect-then-send

   If the data connection to the remote peer is established before the
   PEER message, the challenge for the PCP client is to find out which
   source IP:port the intervening NAT is using to translate the data
   packets.  If the PCP Client has the necessary permissions to reuse
   the socket used by the data connection and the intervening NAT
   support EIM, two solutions are possible:

   1.  PCP Client sends a request from the same source IP:port as the
       data connection.  Since the intervening NAT supports PI-EIM, it
       should allocate the same external IP:port of the data connection,
       which would be returned in the RECEIVED_PORT_OPTION.  The PCP
       Client then can send an appropriate PEER message to take over the
       data connection.  The advantage of this solution is that is built
       around a single protocol, PCP, and the disadvatange is that it
       requires a PCP extension.

   2.  If the PCP Client is also a STUN client it can send a binding
       request from the same source IP:port as the data connection and
       since the intervening NAT supports EIM the client will find out
       the external IP:port that is used to translate data packets.  The
       PCP Client then can send an appropriate PEER message to take over
       the data connection.  The advantage of this solution is that no
       extensions to PCP are needed.  The disadvantage is that STUN
       client and server are needed, specially the fact that in case of
       nested NATs the STUN server needs to be located between NAT1 and
       NAT2.


4.  RECEIVED_SOURCE_IP_PORT Option

   This option (Code TBA, Figure 1) is used by a PCP Server to indicate
   in a PCP response the source IP and port of PCP messages received
   from a PCP Client.  Together with the IP Address of the PCP Client

   conveyed in the common PCP header, a PCP Client uses this information
   to detect whether a NAT is present in the path to reach its PCP
   Server.

   A PCP Client MAY include this option to learn the port number as
   perceived by the PCP Server.  When this option is received by the PCP
   Server, it uses the source IP:port of the received PCP request to set
   the Received Port.


      This Option:
           Option Name: PCP Received Port Option (RECEIVED_SOURCE_IP_PORT)
           Number: TBA (IANA)
           Purpose: Detect the presence of a NAT in the path and discover externally allocate IP:port

5.  SCOPE Option

   The Scope Option (Code TBA, Figure 2) is used by a PCP Client to
   indicate to the PCP Server the scope of the flows that will use a
   given mapping.  This object is meant to be used in the context of
   cascaded PCP Servers/NAT levels.  Two values are defined:

                              Value Meaning
                              ----- --------
                               0x00 Internet
                               0x01 Internal

   When 0x00 value is used, the PCP Proxy MUST propagate the mapping
   request to its upstream PCP Server.  When 0x01 value is used, the
   mapping is to be instantiated only in the first PCP-controlled
   device; no mapping is instantiated in the upstream PCP-controlled
   device.

   When no Scope Option is included in a PCP message, this is equivalent
   to including a Scope Option with a scope value of "Internet".


         This Option:
              Option Name: PCP Scope Policy Option (SCOPE)
              Number: TBA (IANA)
              Purpose: Restrict the scope of PCP requests
              Valid for Opcodes: MAP
