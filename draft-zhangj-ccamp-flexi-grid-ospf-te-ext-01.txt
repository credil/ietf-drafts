Internet-Draft         Routing extension for C-RSA            April 2012


1.  Introduction

   To enable the dynamic and effective allocation of spectrum resource
   based on the demand of the client LSP's requests, the latest revision
   of ITU-T Recommendation [G.694.1] has introduced a flexible grid
   technique in DWDM optical networks.  The flexible grid has a finer
   granularity (i.e. according to the definition of flexible grid in
   [G.694.1], the data channel can be selected on a channel spacing of
   6.25 GHz with a variable slot width measured in units of 12.5 GHz)
   for the spectrum slot.

   In the dynamic flexi-grid networks, except for selecting an
   appropriate route for the client LSP, the appropriate width of
   spectrum slot is also needed to choose and assigned to the client
   LSP.  The spectrum bandwidth assigned to the client LSP is made up of
   an appropriate number of consecutive spectrum slots from end-to-end,
   which is determined by the used modulation format, according to the
   client LSPs data rate requests and physical constraints of the
   selected path.

   Compared with ITU-T fix-grid optical network some extra constraints
   need to be considered when running the routing and spectrum resource
   assignment (RSA) in flexi-grid networks.  In this memo two of those
   constraints (other constraints are left for future considered) that
   are necessary for RSA are discussed in detail in flexi-grid networks,
   and Spectrum Compactness is introduced .and then the extension of
   OSPF-TE protocol for these constraints related to RSA in flexi-grid
   networks is described and also the the value of super-channel bitmap
   member.

4.  Motivation for Routing Protocol Extension

   In this section we introduce the RSA constraints and the motivation
   of routing protocol extension for of flexi-grid networks

4.1.  Constraints Considerations for RSA

   When processing RSA in flexi-grid networks, the constraints
   information (such as the information of spectrum bandwidth in a
   network link and so on.) are necessary for computing and selecting an
   appropriate backup route and a certain number of consecutive spectrum
   slots for the client LSPs effectively.

   Some of the necessary constraints are listed as follows:

   o  Spectral consecutiveness constraint

   o  Variable guard band constraint

   o  Spectral continuity constraint

   o  Impairments constraint

   o  Other constraints

   All the constraints can generate important impacts for the
   performance of the client LSPs, even for the entire network.  The
   first two constraints are mainly talked about in this memeo.

   Just like the wavelength continuity constraint in WSON, the spectral
   continuity constraint means allocation of the same spectrum slots on
   each link along a path because not all of the nodes in optical
   networks have the ability of wavelength conversion.

   The degradation of the optical signals due to impairments that
   accumulate along the path (without 3R regeneration), can result in
   unacceptable bit error rates or even a complete failure to demodulate
   and/or detect the received
   signal[draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-impairments-07].  So it is necessary to
   consider about the impairments constraint within flexi-grid networks.
   The impairments constraint in flexi-grid networks will be studied in
   future in this memo.

   Also, there may be some other constraints for RSA, other than the
   four kinds above, such as the modulation levels constraint, which are
   left for future researching.

4.2.  Consecutive Spectrum Slots Information

   The spectral consecutiveness constraint is that the allocated
   spectrum slots must be chosen from consecutive spectrum slots in the
   spectrum space on each link of flexi-grid networks.

   Compared with the technology of WSON, the number of spectrum slots in
   flexi-grid networks will be much larger than the number of wavelength
   in WSON.  After a long running time, the situation of available
   spectrum slots will be much complex, especially the situation of the
   available consecutive spectrum slots.

   After selecting a route, the appropriate consecutive spectrum slots
   need to be assigned for the client LSP.  When we choose one of the
   backup routes for the client LSP without considering the situation
   about the available consecutive spectrum slots information, the route
   may have no enough consecutive spectrum slots which means that the
   selected route have no available resource for the LSP's request, and
   then the client LSP will be rejected or trigger another path
   computation process which will increase the blocking rate of the
   network or increase network resources consumed by communication and
   computing of new route.

   When computing a route with the knowledge of the consecutive spectrum
   slots information of the network link (for example, the number of ten
   available consecutive spectrum slots in a network link, or the number
   of twenty available consecutive spectrum slots in a network link.),
   it will be very useful to select a better route which has higher
   probability of enough available consecutive spectrum slots for the
   client LSP.  And this will improve the success rate of setting up new
   client LSPs.

4.3.  Spectrum Compactness

   With a new client LSP arriving, a path connection needs to be
   establish and proper consecutive of spectral resource needs to be
   assigned to this LSP.  With the LSP ending, the path connection is
   released, and the spectral resource could be assigned for new LSP.
   In a dynamic traffic scenario, this setup and tear down process leads
   to fragmentation of spectrum resources Note that the probability of
   using these pieces of fragmentations is very low since they are not
   consecutive.  If united together, e.g. one block, they could be used
   for new LSP.  This process is named defragmentation, which aim to
   improve the utilization of spectrum resource.  In order to make the
   defragmentation more effective, the occupation of spectrum in a link
   or in the network is needed to be better known, Spectrum Compactness
   is proposed[OFC2012 JTh2A.35].

Internet-Draft         Routing extension for C-RSA            April 2012


4.4.  Variable Guard Band Information

   Some spectrum slots need to be reserved as Guard Band(GB) between two
   adjacent client LSPs to avoid bad impact of non-linear impairments
   and other network elements.  Since the granularity of the flexi-grid
   networks will be very small, the spectrum interval, i.e., GB need to
   be considered more carefully to avoid poor quality impact of the
   adjacent client LSPs.  Which means with the changing of network
   environment and the operating of the network, the bandwidth of the GB
   also need to change.

   In flexi-grid networks, with the increasing of the total
   transportation power and the smaller of the channel space, the
   channel crosstalk that results from non-linear effects will become
   the important factor that affects the performance of the network.
   The impact between two adjacency client LSPs may be changing based on
   the change of crosstalk and other changes of network.  With the
   changing of those parameters, the interferences between two adjacency
   client LSPs may be increasing, if the Guard Band is fixed, the
   quality of the adjacent client LSPs and also the network's will be
   decreased.  If the GB can be varied based on the network environment
   changing, then the bad impact can be avoided.


5.  OSPF-TE Protocol Extension

   In this section, we define the enhancements to the Traffic
   Engineering (TE) properties of flexi-grid networks' TE links that can
   be announced in OSPF-TE LSAs.

   The TE LSA, which is an opaque 10 LSA with area flooding scope
   [RFC3630], has only one top-level and has one or more nested sub-TLVs
   for extensibility.  [RFC3630] also defines two top Type/Length/Value
   (TLV) triplet to support traffic engineering of OSPF, i.e. (1) Router
   Address TLV and (2) Link TLV.  In this memo, we enhance the sub-TLVs
   for the Link TLV in support of flexi-grid networks.  Specifically, we
   add the following sub-TLVs to the Link TLV:

   o  Consecutive spectrum slots weight sub-TLV

   o  Spectrum Compactne sub-TLV

5.1.  Consecutive Spectrum Slots Weight Sub-TLV

   In distribution networks, we propose the CSSW as a sub-TLV of OSPF-TE
   Link TLV which represents the situation of the available consecutive
   spectrum slots in a link of the flexi-grid networks for example the
   percentage of the total bandwidth of the number of five consecutive

   spectrum slots, the percentage of the total bandwidth of the number
   of ten consecutive spectrum slots ... ).  With knowing the weight of
   available consecutive spectrum slots in a link, the spectrum resource
   assignment in the flexi-grid networks can be working more efficiently
   in a distributed network.

   slot status|||||||||  ||||  |  |  |||||||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |


   The figure above shows a link's spectrum status.Assume there are 20
   slots on a link, and slot 0, slot 1, slot 2, slot 4, slot 8 and slot
   9 are occpuded by three requests.  The number of five consecutive
   spectrum slots is 6, they are (11~15), (12~16), (13~17), (14~18),
   (15~19).  The number of ten consecutive spectrum slots is 1, and it
   is from slot 10 to slot 10,i.e., (10~19).  The number of Spectrum
   Joint is 10.

   The format of the CSSW sub-TLV is as follows:


        0                   1                   2                   3

   indicates the occupation of spectrum in a link or in the network.

6.  Super-Channel Label Encoding Format with GB

   As discussed in [draft-hussain-ccamp-super-channel-label-03], the
   Super-Channel is proposed to support flexi-grid networks.  In this
   memo, we extend the Super-Channel Label Encoding Format by
   considering the Guard Band information.
