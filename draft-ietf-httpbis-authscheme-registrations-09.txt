Internet-Draft  HTTP Authentication Scheme Registrations   November 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document registers Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   authentication schemes which have been defined in standards-track
   RFCs before the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was
   established.

2.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations related to the registration
   itself.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The table below provides registrations of HTTP authentication schemes
   to be added to the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme registry at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes> (see Section 5.1
   of [draft-ietf-httpbis-p7-auth]).
