    <abstract>
      <t>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the
      network. An exception to this requirement occurs when there is an
      IPv6/IPv4 protocol translator in the path, where in-the-network
      fragmentation may be unavoidable when the IPv4 network path includes a
      restricting link. Unfortunately, recent investigations have shown that
      IPv6 Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) interacts poorly with tunnels to the
      point that tunneled packets can be best accommodated only when the
      tunnel ingress is permitted to perform fragmentation. This document

      in-the-network fragmentation by routers that configure tunnel

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the
      network. An exception to this requirement occurs when there is an
      IPv6/IPv4 protocol translator in the path, where in-the-network
      fragmentation may be unavoidable when the IPv4 network path includes a
      restricting link. Unfortunately, recent investigations have shown that
      IPv6 Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) interacts poorly with tunnels <xref
      target="I-D.generic-v6ops-tunmtu"></xref> to the point that tunneled
      packets can be best accommodated only when the tunnel ingress is
      permitted to perform fragmentation. This document therefore asserts an
      additional case in which in-the-network IPv6 fragmentation is
      permitted.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t>The current "Internet cell size" is effectively 1500 bytes (i.e., the
      minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links in the Internet)
      and should therefore also be the minimum MTU assigned to tunnels.
      However, due to issues with PMTUD this size can only be accommodated
      when the tunnel ingress is permitted to perform fragmentation. The
      tunnel ingress can perform fragmentation on the outer packet following
      encapsulation and can instead (or in addition) perform "tunnel
      fragmentation" via an encapsulation mid-layer inserted between the inner
      and outer header. In both cases reassembly would be performed by the
      tunnel egress.</t>

      <t>Unfortunately, the tunnel ingress may not always know the size of the
      reassembly buffer configured by the egress, and the burden for
      reassembly on the egress may be excessive - especially if the egress
      must service many destinations. The third alternative therefore is to
      permit the tunnel ingress to perform fragmentation on the inner packet
      before encapsulation in which case reassembly would be performed by the
      final destination. This document therefore updates the IPv6 protocol
      specification <xref target="RFC2460"> </xref> to enable in-the-network
      fragmentation by tunnel routers.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IPv6 Updates">
      <t>Section 4.5 of <xref target="RFC2460"></xref> includes the
      clause:</t>

      <t>"(Note: unlike IPv4, fragmentation in IPv6 is performed only by
      source nodes, not by routers along a packet's delivery path -- see
      section 5.)"</t>

      <t>This text is already ignored by IPv6/IPv4 translators which must
      perform fragmentation when the IPv4 path beyond the translator includes
      a restricting link. This document proposes that this text also be
      relaxed in the case of tunnels that must perform fragmentation.</t>

      <t>Section 5 of <xref target="RFC2460"></xref> states:</t>

      <t>"In response to an IPv6 packet that is sent to an IPv4 destination
      (i.e., a packet that undergoes translation from IPv6 to IPv4), the
      originating IPv6 node may receive an ICMP Packet Too Big message
      reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280. In that case, the IPv6 node is
      not required to reduce the size of subsequent packets to less than 1280,
      but must include a Fragment header in those packets so that the
      IPv6-to-IPv4 translating router can obtain a suitable Identification
      value to use in resulting IPv4 fragments. Note that this means the
      payload may have to be reduced to 1232 octets (1280 minus 40 for the
      IPv6 header and 8 for the Fragment header), and smaller still if
      additional extension headers are used."</t>

      <t>This document proposes to add the following text immediately after
      the above:</t>

      <t>"In response to an IPv6 packet that is sent to an IPv6 destination
      that is located beyond a tunnel, the originating IPv6 node may receive
      an ICMP Packet Too Big message reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280.
      In that case, the IPv6 node is not required to reduce the size of
      subsequent packets, but must include a Fragment header in any packets
      that are larger than this MTU value but no larger than 1500 bytes. Note
      that the node is permitted to continue to send packets larger than 1500
      bytes without including a Fragment header, but should implement <xref
      target="RFC4821"></xref> to ensure that the packets are reaching the
      final destination."</t>

      <t>An example tunnel protocol that invokes this new clause appears
      in:<xref target="I-D.templin-intarea-seal"></xref>.</t>
