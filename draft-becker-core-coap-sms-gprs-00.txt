                  Transport of CoAP over SMS and GPRS
                   draft-becker-core-coap-sms-gprs-00

Abstract

   The Short Message Service (SMS) of mobile cellular networks is
   frequently used in Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such as
   for telematic devices.  The service offers small packet sizes and
   high delays just as other typical low-power and lossy networks
   (LLNs), i.e. 6LoWPANs.  The design of the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP), that took the limitations of LLNs into account, is
   thus also applicable to telematic M2M devices.  The adaption of CoAP
   to the SMS transport mechanism is described in this document.

Internet-Draft                CoAP SMS/GPRS                 October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification details the usage of the Constrained Application
   Protocol on the Short Message Service of mobile cellular networks.

1.1.  Scenarios

   Figure 1 to Figure 5 show various applicable usage scenarios of CoAP
   in M2M communications.  Two mobile cellular terminals communicate by
   exchanging CoAP Request and Response embedded into SMS PDUs (depicted
   in Figure 1).

                                  CoAP-REQ
                         +------+  (SMS)   +------+
                         |  A   | -------> |  B   |
                         |(cell)| <------- |(cell)|
                         +------+ CoAP-RES +------+
                                   (SMS)

      Figure 1: Cellular and Cellular Communication (only SMS-based)

   Two mobile cellular terminals communicate by exchanging the CoAP
   Request in an SMS PDU and the CoAP Responce using GPRS transport.
   (depicted in Figure 2).

                                  CoAP-REQ
                         +------+  (SMS)   +------+
                         |  A   | -------> |  B   |
                         |(cell)| <------- |(cell)|
                         +------+ CoAP-RES +------+
                                   (GPRS)

      Figure 2: Cellular and Cellular Communication (SMS/GPRS-based)

   An IP host and a mobile cellular terminal communicate by exchanging
   CoAP Request and Response.  The IP host uses protocols offered by the
   SMS-C (e.g.  Computer Interface to Message Distribution (CIMD
   [cimd]), Universal Computer Protocol/External Machine Interface (UCP/
   EMI [ucp]), Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP [smpp]) ) to submit an
   SMS for delivery, which contains the CoAP Request (depicted in
   Figure 3).

         Figure 3: IP and Cellular Communication (only SMS-based)

   Again, the return path for the CoAP response might be GPRS (depicted
   in Figure 4).

         Figure 4: IP and Cellular Communication (SMS/GPRS-based)

   There are service providers offering SMS delivery and notification
   using an HTTP/REST interface (depicted in Figure 5).

                                        CIMD

   At the moment, this document assumes the scenarios shown in Figure 1,
   Figure 3 and Figure 5), i.e.\ only SMS transport.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Encoding of CoAP for SMS transport

   The content of SMS can be coded in 7, 8 or 16 bit characters
   [3gpp_ts23.038].  The advantages and disadvantages are:

   a.  7 bit encoding: Sending 7 bit encoded SMS possible with almost
       all devices.  CoAP binary data needs to be re-encoded, possibly
       with Base64 RFC 4648 [RFC4648].

   b.  8 bit encoding: CoAP binary data does not need to be re-encoded.
       Not all telematic devices support 8 bit SMS encoding.

   c.  16 bit encoding: CoAP binary data needs to be re-encoded.  Not
       all telematic devices support 16 bit SMS encoding.

   The currently safest solution is to use 7 bit encoded SMS including
   Base64 encoded CoAP payload.


3.  Message Size Implementation Considerations

   Using 7 bit encoding 160 characters are allowed in 1 SMS, while using
   8 bit encoding 140 characters are allowed.  [3gpp_ts23.038]

   Possible options for larger CoAP messages are:

   a.  Multiple SMS concatenation

   b.  CoAP Block [I-D.ietf-core-block]


4.  Options

   Uri-Host and Uri-Port options MUST NOT be included in the CoAP
   header.  End-points receiving CoAP messages over SMS with such
   options MUST behave as specified in [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   Open question: Is the introduction of a new CoAP option Reply-To-Uri-
   Host necessary, if the server should use the GPRS transport for the
   Response?  This relates to Figure 2 and Figure 4.

5.  Protocol Constants

   The RESPONSE_TIMEOUT variable SHOULD be configured for a higher
   duration than specified in [I-D.ietf-core-coap], i.e. 10 s.


6.  Multicast

   Multicast MUST not be used with the SMS transport.


7.  Proxying Considerations

   TBD (Proxying into an IPv6/v4 network (e.g. a 6LoWPAN network)
   possible?)


8.  SMS URI scheme for link-format

   Open question: Make use of RFC5724 SMS URI scheme?
