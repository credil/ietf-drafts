                 IPsec Multiple Interfaces Requirements
              draft-mglt-mif-security-requirements-02.txt

Abstract

   Multiple Interface Nodes (MIF Nodes) may use their Multiple
   Interfaces to perform Mobility, Multihoming.  Then, these MIF Nodes
   may also manage traffic between these Multiple Interfaces.  Because
   IPsec has not been designed for Multiple Interfaces, MIF Nodes have
   difficulties to benefit from MIF features with IPsec protected
   communications.

   This document provides use cases where IPsec protected communications
   would take advantage of MIF features.  From these uses cases, we
   identify the different IPsec features MIF Nodes would require.  Then,
   we expose the limitations of the IPsec related protocols IKEv2 and
   MOBIKE regarding to these MIF features before listing the MIF IPsec
   Security Requirements that should be address by a extension of IKEv2
   or MOBIKE.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   IPsec protocol suite [RFC4301],[RFC5996] is mainly used to:
   - Extend a trusted domain over an untrusted network:  This typically
         corresponds to the Virtual Private Network (VPN) use case.  A
         Security Gateway is a trusted entry point to a trusted network.
         The end user is connected to an untrusted network and tunnels
         its traffic to the Security Gateway in a encrypted tunnel using
         the IPsec tunnel mode.  The Security Gateway decapsulates the
         traffic and forwards it on the trusted network.  Once the
         traffic is in the trusted network it is usually not encrypted
         anymore.  In other words, the traffic is protected from the end
         user terminal to the Security Gateway, that it to say over the
         untrusted network.
   - Provide end-to-end security:  With end to end security, the traffic
         is protected from the source - or the end user in our case - to
         the destination.  The traffic does not require to be tunneled,
         and any segments of the network between the end user and the
         destination is considered as untrusted.  With end-to-end
         security, one does not require encapsulation, and the IPsec
         transport mode can be used.

   IPsec [RFC4301], [RFC5996] and its tunnel mode Mobility and
   Multihoming extension MOBIKE [RFC4555] have not been designed for
   Multiple Interface environment.  As such MIF Nodes cannot take full
   advantage of MIF features with IPsec protected communications.  In
   order to may IPsec protected communications compatible with MIF
   features, IPsec / IKEv2 extensions MUST be designed so:
   - Mobility, Multihoming and Multiple Interface features can be
   provided for both IPsec tunnel and transport mode.
   - IPsec nodes can dynamically ADD an new Interface for all ongoing
   IPsec protected communications
   - IPsec nodes dynamically REMOVE an old Interface for all ongoing
   IPsec protected communications
   - IPsec nodes can perform soft and hard handover handover
   - IPsec nodes can manage IPsec traffic over Multiple Interfaces by
   selecting the IPsec Security Association a Multiple Interface
   operation (ADD, REMOVE, Soft/Hard Handover, Multihoming) occurs.
         This includes selecting a subtraffic as well as performing a
         Multiple Interface operation over multiple Security
         Associations in a single IKEv2 exchange.

   The following document is structured as follows: Section 4 provides
   the use cases that motivated this document.  This use cases show how
   IPsec currently do not fit with MIF features.  From Section 4, this
   document identify IPsec MIF features in Section 5.  For each feature,
   this document points how IPsec is impacted.  Follows Section 6 with
   describes the problem statement by showing the current limitation of
   IKEv2 and MOBIKE protocols over the IPsec MIF features.  Finally
   Section 7 provides the MIF IPsec requirements that should be
   considered by an IPsec / IKEv2 extension so that IPsec communications
   can take full advantage of the MIF features.


3.  Terminology

   In this document, we use the following terminology:
   - IPsec Node:   designates a node that has one or more active
         Security Associations with another IPsec node.
   - MIF Node:   designates a node that has Multiple Interfaces.
   - Mobile Node (MN):   designates a Node that is likely to perform
         Mobility.
   - Correspondent Node (CN):   designates the node a MN has established
         communications with.
   - Radio Access Network (RAN):   designates the Cellular Access
         Network managed by ISPs
   - Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN):   designates the WiFi Access
         Network not necessarily managed by ISP.

   Note that IPsec Node, MIF Node, Mobile Node and Correspondent Node
   are independent designations, and that a given Node can be designated
   with more than one designation.


4.  Use Cases Scenarios

   This section provides various use cases where MIF nodes would like to
   take advantage of MIF features for IPsec communications.

4.1.  Offload Use Cases

4.1.1.  Differences between RAN and WLAN requires MIF and Security

   Radio Access Network (RAN) are not expected to be able to support the
   demand for mobile data.  As such, ISPs are looking to offload the
   communications currently supported by RAN to WLAN networks.  RAN and
   WLAN have different characteristics, and the Mobile Node is expected
   to overcome these differences:





Migault & Williams      Expires January 31, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   IPsec Multiple Interfaces Requirements        July 2012


   - WLAN does not handle with Mobility:   RAN are managed by the ISP
         which is responsible for handling the Mobile Node Mobility with
         multiple handovers between the RAN cells.  Handover is
         performed with the Radio Layer, making Mobility transparent to
         the IP layer.  WLAN Access are not expected to communicate
         between each other.  They eventually may belong to different
         ISPs or IP Networks and thus provide different IP addresses to
         their attached nodes.  Therefore, when the Mobile Node moves
         from one WLAN Access Point to another one, its IP address may
         be changed.  The Mobile has to deal with these changes of IP
         address.  WLAN Mobility is handled by the Mobile node whereas
         RAN Mobility is handled by the Network.
   - WLAN may be untrusted Networks:   RAN is managed by the ISP which
         is responsible of each of the RAN Access Points, and the Mobile
         Node has a trusted relationship with the ISP it has subscribed
         to.  As a result, ISP Network behind the RAN Access Point is
         considered as a trusted network, and only the attachment from
         the Mobile Node to the Access Point needs to be secured.  Layer
         2 or Radio Layer was sufficient to provide a secure attachment
         to a trusted network.  On the other hand, WLAN Access Points
         may be provided by various third parties, that may not have
         trusted relations with the ISP.  WLAN Access Point may be
         managed, for example, by an independent provider, an Hotel, an
         individual.  As a result, no trusted relationship exists
         between the Mobile Node and the WLAN Access Point, and secure
         attachment to a trusted network requires upper layer security.
         This document considers securing the IP layer with IPsec
         [RFC4301].
   - WLAN are unreliable Networks:   In addition to a trusted
         relationship, the Mobile Node and its ISP have also
         availability constraints.  Since WLAN Access Points may not be
         managed by the ISP, they may have no reliability or Quality of
         Service constraints toward the connected Mobile Nodes.  For
         example, if a Mobile Node is attached to a DSL box, nothing
         prevents the owner of the DSL box to reboot its box or
         disconnect the attached Mobile Nodes.  To overcome the Network
         unreliability, we consider, in this document two different
         mechanisms 1) Multihoming and 2) Simultaneous Use of Multiple
         Interfaces.  Both mechanisms require the Mobile Node is able to
         to be attached to various WLAN Access Points and so, to have
         Multiple Interfaces.  With Multihoming the Mobile Node runs a
         communication on a single Primary Interface, and provides its
         Correspondent Node Alternate IP addresses that may be used if
         the the Primary Interface is not reachable.  With Simultaneous
         Use of Multiple Interfaces, the Mobile Node is able to spread
         its communications between the Interfaces which lower the
         probability a communication is interrupted.  Furthermore, the
         Mobile Node may also use the different Interfaces for a given

Internet-Draft   IPsec Multiple Interfaces Requirements        July 2012


         communication also known as bandwidth aggregation.  Multihoming
         and Simultaneous Use of Multiple Interfaces may also be
         combined.  SCTP [RFC4960] and MPTCP [RFC6182] have especially
         been designed to implement these mechanisms.

4.1.2.  Offloading Internet Access from RAN to WLAN

   In this section, we consider that the ISP offload Internet Access by
   providing the Mobile Nodes a Security Gateway as a security entry
   point to the ISP trusted network.  The Mobile Node builds an IPsec
   tunnel to the Security Gateway.  This IPsec tunnel extends the
   trusted Network over the WLAN untrusted Network, and thus overcome
   the WLAN untrusted issue.

   To overcome the Mobility issue, the Mobile Node is able to update the
   IP address provided by the WLAN Access Point.  Note that in this
   section, because the communication is tunneled to the Security
   Gateway, Mobility is performed by updating the outer IP address.  The
   outer IP address is defined by IPsec and so Mobility can be performed
   by updating the IPsec configuration.  Updating the outer IP address
   of the tunnel results in Hard Handover Mobility and does not require
   Multiple Interfaces.  On the other hand, Soft Handover Mobility
   requires Multiple Interfaces.  Soft Handover Mobility may be
   performed before the new Interface is available, similarly to the
   Hard Handover.  We note, in this document, UPDATE and SOFT_HAND_OVER
   the respective Hard Handover and Soft Handover Mobility.  On the
   other hand, Soft Handover may also be performed once the Mobile Node
   has at least two active Interfaces.  In fact, in most cases, the
   Mobile Node may not know which Interface is going to be used, so it
   may be wise to use Multiple Interfaces, and provide time to the
   connection manager to decide which Interfaces are to be used or
   removed.

   In order to take advantage of the Multiple Interfaces, when the
   Mobile Node detects a new Access Point and is assigned a new IP
   address, it may be able to select a communication and be able to ADD
   this Interface to it.  Similarly, it also may be able to REMOVE this
   Interface from the communication.

   Note that IPsec is using a ordered Security Policy Database (SPD).
   Unless the system has been designed with per Interface SPD, the
   Interface used by the outgoing tunnel is defined by the first SPD
   match.  Outgoing packets with the same IP source and destination will
   always match a single Security Policy and use the same Interface.  As
   a result, to take full advantage of Multiple Interfaces, SCTP or
   MPTCP should be used so to enable different source IP.  More details
   are provided in Section 4.2.

Internet-Draft   IPsec Multiple Interfaces Requirements        July 2012


   In addition to the MPTCP / SCTP Multiple Interface features, the
   Mobile Node overcome WLAN unreliability with Multihoming and Traffic
   Selections.  Multihoming makes possible the Mobile Node to inform its
   Correspond Node Alternate IP addresses.  These IP addresses MUST be
   used if the currently used IP address is not reachable anymore.
   Traffic Selection makes possible connection managers to spread
   traffic among multiple Interfaces and to select the Access Network
   for each ongoing communications.  SELECTORs are used to define the
   communication the UPDATE, ADD or REMOVE action is performed.

4.1.3.  Offloading Services from RAN to WLAN

   In this section we consider end-to-end security.  With Offloading
   Internet Access, only the segment between the Mobile Node and the
   Security Gateway is secured with IPsec.  With end-to-end security,
   the communication from the Mobile Node to the Correspondent Node is
   secured with IPsec.  End-to-end security can be set both with the
   IPsec tunnel mode or with the IPsec transport mode.  Using the IPsec
   transport mode ovoids the tunnel overhead, and makes the system more
   dynamic.  This makes the IPsec transport mode preferred for
   applications with real time constraints.  Compared to the Security
   Gateway architecture, end-to-end security avoids routing
   indirections, makes IPsec platforms deployed on a per services base
   which eases their load control and resource allocation.

   When end-to-end Security is provided with the IPsec tunnel mode, one
   can refer to Section 4.1.2.  In the remaining of this section, we
   consider the IPsec transport mode is used.

   Unlike the Security Gateway architecture that uses the IPsec tunnel
   mode, the transport mode cannot perform Mobility.  Mobility has to be
   performed by other protocols.  SCTP and MPTCP are examples of
   protocols that may make Mobility possible with Multiple Interfaces.
   Other mechanisms like session resumption mechanisms can also be
   performed, for example, at the application layer.  These upper layer
   mechanisms provide the ability to UPDATE, ADD or REMOVE an Interface
   to a given communication.

   Thus, with the IPsec transport mode, IPsec Multiple Interface
   features should be seen as configuring the IPsec layer so these upper
   layer mechanisms can be applied on a IPsec protected communication.
   As a result, our Mobile Node is expected to be able to select an
   IPsec protected communication identified by its Security Association.
   For that selected communication, the Mobile Node MUST be able to
   UPDATE the IP addresses so that Hard Handover Mobility can be
   performed by upper layer mechanisms.  The Mobile is also expected to
   ADD or REMOVE an Interface so that upper layer mechanisms can perform
   Mobility Soft Handover or perform traffic management between the

   various Interfaces.

4.2.  Virtual Private Network (VPN)

   Companies usually extends their private network by using IPsec VPN.
   The architecture used for VPN is very similar to the one described in
   Section 4.1.2.  The architecture is the same, that is a Mobile Node
   tunnels is being assigned a private IP address by the Security
   Gateway, and the communication between the private destination or
   private proxy is tunneled in an IPsec tunnel between the untrusted
   WLAN Access Point to the Security Gateway.

   The main difference with the case described in Section 4.1.2, is that
   WLAN is not considered as an alternative to the Radio Access Network,
   and the VPN is intentionally initiated by the Mobile Node.  Thus, the
   main use case is an employee located outside its company that set up
   the VPN to access the company's internal resources from its PC.  The
   Mobile Node as long been expected to be nomadic, rather than Mobile,
   and MOBIKE addressed this use case with Hard Handover Mobility.
   MOBIKE has been standardized in 2008, before iPhone has been
   available (2009), and now VPN end users do not only want to access
   their companies resources from a nomadic PC but also from Smartphones
   that have been widely available.  Considering Smartphones rather than
   PCs considerably increases the Mobility Requirements of the today's
   VPN use case over the one in 2008.  More specifically, Smartphones
   are always connected, and sessions are constantly exchanging packets.
   During a Hard Handover Mobility, packets may be lost.  With an
   increasing number of sessions, and more and more exchanged data, the
   number of lost packets make reach the Replay Window counter.  If the
   Security Gateway and the VPN client implements [RFC6311], the VPN
   client may renegotiate its IPsec counter.  This adds an additional
   negotiation delay to the delay introduced by the lost packets.
   Without this mechanism the VPN is broken and MUST be re-established.
   Soft Handover Mobility would reduce the number of lost packets over a
   Hard Handover Mobility and avoids the client VPN to renegotiate the
   IPsec counters.

   Now, the VPN use case considers taking advantage of Multiple
   Interfaces in order to perform bandwidth aggregation and Soft
   Handover Mobility.  Similarly to the use case described in
   Section 4.1.2, when the Mobile Node detects a new Access Point and is
   assigned a new IP address, it MUST be able to ADD this Interface to
   the VPN.  Similarly, it also MUST be able to REMOVE this Interface
   from the VPN, to perform a Soft Handover Mobility or a Hard Handover
   Mobility.

   As mentioned in Section 4.1.2, to fully take advantage of the
   Multiple Interface features, like bandwidth aggregation or Soft

Internet-Draft   IPsec Multiple Interfaces Requirements        July 2012


   Handover Mobility, it is recommended to use protocols like MPTCP in
   combination with IPsec.  However, regular VPN using TCP can still
   benefit from using Multiple Interfaces.

   First, if a Mobile Node is using MPTCP detects a new Interface, it
   can ADD this new Interface to the MPTCP session.  ADDing this
   Interface to the IPsec layer means that we consider two tunnels one
   that tunnels the packets from the old interface, and one that
   considers the packets from the new Interface.  Which Interface will
   be used as the outer IP address will be defined by the Security
   Association.  If the Mobile Node is using TCP, the new Interface
   cannot be added to the TCP session.  Using the two Interfaces would
   mean that the IPsec Security Association would alternatively use one
   or the other Interface.  This MAY be done by using Security Policy
   Databases per Interface in conjunction of a traffic load balancer
   that would balance the traffic between the two Interfaces.  However,
   current system uses a centralized Security Database which is an order
   database.  Security Associations are mainly indexed with IP addresses
   and ports.  In the case of TCP these values does not change, and a
   single Security Association is chosen, thus making all traffic going
   to a single Interface.  With TCP, ADDing an Interface would mean
   creating a Security Association that tunnels the TCP session to the
   new Interface.  This Security Association SHOULD have a lower order
   than the Security Association tunneling the TCP session to the old
   Interface, which prevent the TCP session to be interrupted during the
   negotiation.  Once set, the Mobile Node is sending the TCP session
   packet to the old Interface, but is likely to receive IPsec packets
   on both Interfaces.  This is the property we use to perform Soft
   Handover Mobility by changing the order between the two Security
   Associations.  This prevents packet lost.

4.3.  IPsec as a distributed firewall

   Some companies are using IPsec to secure their private network and
   prevent unauthorized hosts to be connected to the servers.  The IPsec
   property used in that case is the authentication part rather than the
   confidentiality and encryption part.  Similarly end-to-end security
   is usually using the IPsec transport mode.  Resources MAY be accessed
   by PCs and Smartphones connected over WLAN Access Points.

   When these devices are assigned new IP addresses, they currently
   cannot update their IPsec Security Association and need to re-
   negotiate a new IPsec Association.  Negotiation and authentication
   interrupts or delay the ongoing session.  Updating the IPsec
   configuration would avoid to perform the re-authentication.  Multiple
   Interface properties would make possible Soft Handover.  Currently
   none of this actions can be performed, and MOBIKE has only considered
   Mobility Hard Handover for the IPsec tunnel mode.

Internet-Draft   IPsec Multiple Interfaces Requirements        July 2012


4.4.  Cloud Computing distributing Security Domains

   With Cloud computing, multiple security domains may be hosted on
   various pieces of hardware connected via IPsec.  As a result these
   different pieces of hardware are exchanging information using
   multiple IPsec sessions - at least one per security domain.  When a
   piece of hardware is changing its IP address, or when it acquires a
   additional Interface, it currently needs to renegotiate each IPsec
   connection separately.  With the tunnel mode and MOBIKE, re-
   authentication can be avoided.  MOBIKE makes possible Multihoming,
   Hard Handover Mobility.  All other operations requires a per Security
   Association negotiation, which may include or not a re-
   authentication.

   In this case, hosts want to be able to update Security Association in
   IPsec transport mode and in Tunnel mode.  Then the hosts want to be
   able to announce Interface changes in a single announcement, avoiding
   the per Security Association announcement.  On the other hand, load
   balancing the resources may also require mobility, to be performed
   only for a subtraffic.  Soft Handover Mobility may also be used for
   traffic management, so the hosts need to be able to select some IPsec
   communications.


5.  IPsec MIF features

   From the different use cases detailed in Section 4, we identify the
   following IPsec MIF features.

5.1.  Multihoming

   Multihoming is the ability to provision Interfaces in case the
   running Interface is not reachable anymore.  For an IPsec secure
   communication, the EU wants to provide one or a range of Alternate IP
   addresses that MUST be used in case the Primary Interface is not
   reachable.  The difference with ADDing an interface to an given
   communication is that with Multihoming the Alternate MUST be used
   only if the Primary Interface is not reachable.

   On an IPsec point of view, it means that IPsec MUST be configured to
   DISCARD any packets of the communication unless the Primary Interface
   is not reachable.  When the Primary Interface is not reachable, then
   IPsec MUST be configured to PROTECT or BYPASS the traffic for the
   given communication.

5.2.  Hard Handover Mobility

   Hard handover Mobility is the ability for a host to update an
   Interface with another.

   On an IPsec point of view, Mobility Hard Handover consists in
   modifying an existing Security Association.  More specifically, the
   IP addresses used as the selectors of the Security Association MUST
   be modified when the transport mode is used.  When the tunnel mode is
   used, the tunnel IP addresses MUST be modified.

5.3.  Soft Handover Mobility

   Soft Handover Mobility is the ability for a host to smoothly move
   traffic from one Interface to the other.  Soft Handover requires that
   the host is able to handle two Interfaces.

   On an IPsec point of view, Soft Handover Mobility consists in ADDing
   an new Security Association that is derived from an existing
   established Security Association and then REMOVing the existing
   Security Association.

   When the IPsec transport mode is used, Soft Handover MUST be
   performed in conjunction with upper layer mechanisms like those
   provided by SCTP, MPTCP or session resumption.

5.4.  Dynamic addition of an Interface

   Dynamic addition of an Interface is the ability for a host to send
   traffic of an ongoing communication to a additional and newly added
   Interface

   On an IPsec point of view, dynamic addition of an Interface requires
   to create a new Security Association derived from an existing
   Security Association.

5.5.  Dynamic removal of an Interface

   Dynamic removal of an Interface is the ability for a host to
   configure all its sessions so that traffic is not sent or received
   from an still existing or not anymore existing Interface.

   On an IPsec point of view, this consists of removing all or a subset
   of Security Association that concerns a given Interface and
   discarding the traffic sent to or received on this Interface.

5.6.  Traffic Selection

   Traffic Selection consists in selecting a single, a set or all
   communications in order to perform an action.

   On an IPsec point of view, Traffic Selection consist in selecting a
   the single, a set or all Security Association associated between two
   hosts.  This makes possible to apply a IPsec action on a given
   subtraffic as well as to configure multiple Security Associations in
   a single exchange.


6.  Problem Statement

6.1.  MOBIKE limitations

   MOBIKE [RFC4555] is the IKEv2 extension that has been designed to
   handle Mobility and Multihoming.  However, it presents the following
   limitations:
   - MOBIKE does not consider the transport mode:   MOBIKE has only been
         designed for the Tunnel mode.
   - MOBIKE has not been designed for Multiple Interfaces:   MOBIKE has
         only been designed for a single Interface.
   - MOBIKE does not consider Soft Handover Mobility:   MOBIKE has only
         been designed for Hard Handover Mobility.  In fact a Soft
         Handover Mobility would require the simultaneous use of two
         Interfaces.  Since MOBIKE has only been designed for nodes with
         a single Interface, Soft Handover Mobility is out of scope of
         MOBIKE.
   - MOBIKE does not consider Mobility or Multihoming for a specific
   communication:   In fact MOBIKE has been designed for nodes with a
         single Interface, thus Mobility or Multihoming operations
         affect all tunneled IPsec ongoing communications, as well as
         the IKEv2 signaling channel.

6.2.  IKEv2 limitations

   IKEv2 [RFC5996] has been designed to negotiate Security Associations.
   It has neither been designed to handle Mobility nor Multihoming.
   Multiple Interface operations like ADD REMOVE and therefore
   SOFT_HAND_OVER can be considered as a IKEv2 or combinations of IKEv2
   operations.

   When a new interface is detected by the end user, it may add it to
   the current communication by negotiating a new Security Association,
   independent from the Security Associations that already exist.  A
   complete IKEv2 exchange that includes the authentication can be
   initiated.  However, this includes a 4 message exchange, with an

Internet-Draft   IPsec Multiple Interfaces Requirements        July 2012


   authentication that may delay of a few seconds the Security
   Association negotiation.  To avoid re-authentication, the
   CREATE_CHILD exchange can be used for that purpose.  However, the
   CREATE_CHILD exchange presents the following limitations:
   - CREATE_CHILD is not mandatory for IKEv2:   This means that all
         IKEv2 implementations do not provide the ability to renegotiate
         the IPsec Traffic Selectors of a given Security Association.
   - CREATE_CHILD support is not advertised to the peers:   Whether an
         IPsec node implements or not the CREATE_CHILD exchange is not
         advertised.  This MAY result in breaking a communication.  For
         example, a IPsec Mobile Node may initiate a CREATE_CHILD
         exchange for a Mobility Hard Handover that is rejected by the
         Correspondent Node.
   - CREATE_CHILD is a 2 packet exchange:   In the case of Soft Handover
         two exchanges are required, which makes soft Handover as a 4
         packet exchange.  Mobility operations are sensitive operations
         and should be as straight forward as possible, with a single
         exchange.
   - CREATE_CHILD is a per SA negotiation:  In the case a Mobile Node
         has Multiple IPsec Security Associations with its Correspondent
         Node, Multiple CREATE_CHILD exchanges are required.  Mobility
         operations are sensitive operation and should be as straight
         forward as possible.  One exchange is expected.  For a Mobile
         Node sharing n IPsec Security Associations with its
         Correspondent Node, a Soft Handover with CREATE_CHILD would
         require 2 * n CREATE_CHILD exchanges.  We expect this number of
         exchanges to be reduced to 1.
   - CREATE_CHILD is complex:   The CREATE_CHILD exchange has been
         designed to completely renegotiate a Security Association.  As
         a result, all parameters of the Security Association Database
         can be mentioned.  This results in quite complex exchange,
         which is the reason lightweight IKEv2 implementations are not
         required to implement this exchange.  The Multihoming, Mobility
         operations in this document do not interact with other
         parameters than the IP addresses associated to the Security
         Association.  We expect a much appropriate an simpler syntax.

   To REMOVE an Interface, IKEv2 provides the DELETE Notify Payload.
   This exchange is quite straight forward but:
   - DELETE is a per SA exchange:   (see CREATE_CHILD item)

   SOFT_HAND_OVER can be considered as a combination of ADD and REMOVE
   actions.  However neither IKEV2 does not provide the ability to
   perform them with a single message exchange.  For performance issues,
   we want that Soft Handover Mobility can be performed with a single
   message exchange (SOFT_HAND_OVER).

   IKEV2 does not provide the ability to select a set or all Security

Internet-Draft   IPsec Multiple Interfaces Requirements        July 2012


   Associations associated to an Interface.  Traffic Selectors are
   negotiated to define the traffic selectors associated to an Security
   Association.  As a result IKEv2 only provides the granularity for a
   single Security Association or for all Security Association
   associated to an IKEv2 channel or IKEv2 session.  This granularity
   does not ease traffic management based on Interfaces.


7.  IPsec MIF Requirements

   Finally, MIF requires IPsec /IKEv2 / MOBIKE to be extended so:
   - Mobility, Multihoming and Multiple Interface features can be
   provided for both IPsec tunnel and transport mode.
   - IPsec nodes can dynamically ADD an new Interface for all ongoing
   IPsec protected communications
   - IPsec nodes dynamically REMOVE an old Interface for all ongoing
   IPsec protected communications
   - IPsec nodes can perform soft and hard handover handover
   - IPsec nodes can manage IPsec traffic over Multiple Interfaces by
   selecting the IPsec Security Association a Multiple Interface
   operation (ADD, REMOVE, Soft/Hard Handover, Multihoming) occurs.
         This includes selecting a subtraffic as well as performing a
         Multiple Interface operation over multiple Security
         Associations in a single IKEv2 exchange.


8.  Security Considerations

   The whole document sets MIF requirements for a security protocol.


9.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration here.
