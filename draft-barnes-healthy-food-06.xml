    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the basic requirements for food for folks 
      that attend IETF meetings require special diets, as well as those 
      that prefer to eat healthy. While, the variety of 
      special diets is quite broad, the most general categories are described.
      There can be controversy as to what constitutes healthy eating, but there
      are some common, generally available foods that comprise the basis for 
      healthy eating and special diets. This document provides some recommendations
      to meeting planners, as well as participants, in handling these requirements.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>While much of the success of IETF protocols can be attributed to 
      the availability of large cookies and readily available beer, 
      there are
      some IETF participants for whom such items aren't compatible with 
      dietary restrictions or the choice to eat a healthy diet.  
      So, while the IETF Tao <xref target="RFC6722"/> 
      describes the IETF as "a place to go for 'many fine lunches and dinners'", 
      for folks 
      with dietary restrictions, 
      meals can require the most planning and be one the most stressful aspect of the meetings.           
       Certainly, the tao 
      clearly states that folks are on their own for lunches and dinners, however, the meeting fee
      does cover (some of) the cost for the food provided at breakfasts and breaks.  
      The dietary restrictions are quite varied, but fall into
      general catgories based typically on medical, religious, health and ethical reasons.
      While <xref target="RFC6640"/>  
      describes some food considerations which are very useful for the average attendee, 
      it intentionally does not address
      the dietary restrictions described in this document.        
      </t>

      <t>Most folks are generally understanding of dietary restrictions for medical
      conditions such as diabetes, celiac disease, and folks with severe allergies to foods 
      such as peanuts that cause immediate anaphylactic and often life threatening reactions.
      In general, folks respect the special diets required for religious reasons and for 
      folks who have chosen to follow a healthy and vegan/vegetarian diet, which for some 
      folks also has a religious basis. 
      More subtle food allergies and sensitivies, as well as less common medical conditions (e.g., PKU)
      can sometimes be more difficult to handle, both 
      in terms of the understanding by the general public and food service staff. 
      It is also important to note that these dietary restrictions are not just an inconvenience, 
      but rather they 
      can introduce a barrier to full participation by a subset of the population.  The
      logistics involved in obtaining the appropriate food can interfere with participation in the 
      meeting sessions, as 
      well as informal discussions.      </t>
    
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">

      <t>In general, most folks on restricted diets are very resourceful in terms of researching the 
      meeting venue and determining availability of "safe foods".  Folks with 
      these food restrictions
      typically are proficient at managing these situations provided they have access to information 
      or are able to talk directly with food service staff, in particular the head chef.
      However, in some cases, this can 
      be more difficult in terms of access to the "safe food" when folks are in 
      foreign countries where
      their native language (or a language in which they are very fluent) is not widely understood or
      when the meeting venue is in a more remote geograhic location. Indeed, many of the folks with 
      dietary restrictions arrive at the meetings early enough to scout out locations for 
      finding "safe food".
      However, at times, the hotels modify their typical food service offerings, 
      such as ordering from menus  
      to just providing a more restricted subset of food choices, 
      to optimize the handling of the large crowds and limited time
      during the lunch period. Typically, the extra food service areas
       (carts, etc.) that 
      some meeting venues use to handle the lunch crowds do not offer any food 
      appropriate for several
      of the dietary restrictions.  
      Meeting venues that are not co-located with the meeting
      hotel, in particular those that are not located in the city center,
       typically introduce the most problems
      in terms of availability of safe food.  The cafes that may be located at the venue typically
      do not have any safe foods available and often the availability of food for 
      participants in the general area of the venue (i.e., close enough so folks can get back to
      the venue for afternoon meetings) is very limited at these locations.      
    </t>
    <t> Many folks with dietary restrictions compensate for the lack of readily available 
    safe food by 
      bringing food from home to the meeting. In the case where the meeting is in the home country, 
      there is likely no issue with this practice. However, many meetings require a large 
      number of IETF
      participants to travel to foreign countries, many of whom prohibit the participants from
      bringing outside food. Since the food from home often provides a large part of the 
      sustenance for
      participants with restricted diets, this can introduce a large problem - either the participant 
      goes without or they violate the laws of a particular country and don't declare the food to 
      avoid confiscation. 
      While folks with restrictions due to medical conditions can bring a doctor's letter, there is 
      still a risk of the food being confiscated, since it is highly unlikely that the folks handling 
      the situation are able to make a decision outside the rules with or without the letter. 
      Certainly, participants have a choice, although difficult in cases where the meetings are 
      required for their jobs, as to whether or not they attend a meetings. IETF is an open and
      inclusive organization, thus facilitating accessiblity to safe foods should be a human factors 
      consideration for the meetings.  In addition, laws in some countries (e.g., American 
      Disabilities Act in the U.S.) classify some medical 
      conditions as invisible disabilities (e.g., celiac disease, food allergies, hearing issues)
      and thus require that accomodations be made for 
      dietary restrictions for medical reasons,
      in the same way as accomodations are made for other disabilities.
      The American Disabilities Act applies to non-profit agencies that serve the public. </t>

      <t>The objective of this document is to summarize some common requirements for all 
      special diets.   The focus of this document is to 
      provide information for individuals/organization that choose venues (<xref target="venues"/>),
      meeting organizers (<xref target="planners"/>),
      participants (<xref target="Participants"/>) and the meeting 
      venue staff (<xref target="venue"/>) to meet some basic requirements 
      for these dietary restrictions. It is recommended that these recommendations
      be more formally adopted by the first two groups (i.e., those that choose venues and
      those that organize and run the logistics for the meeting) into their procedures. </t>
      
      
      <t> This document is not intended to provide comprehensive information about
      any of these dietary restrictions, but rather the restrictions are described 
      in a 
      very general sense, with a few examples, to provide the context 
      for the recommendations
      in this document. The references include cookbooks that are 
      representative of the special
      diets discussed in this document. Most of these cookbooks provide a
       basic overview of 
      particular dietary restriction, lists of safe ingredients, etc. 
      There are a plethora of websites with tons of more information on 
      this topic and specific dietary restrictions. 
      </t>
      
      <t> In addition, this document discusses the importance of providing
       remote attendance for folks whose
      conditions limit their ability to travel.  It is hoped that by 
      increasing the availability of foods 
      for folks with these restrictions could increase the ability for 
      some folks to attend the face to face 
      meetings.</t>

      <t>While discussion of this document was originally targeted for the ietf-food@employees.org
       mailing list, it has become increasingly clear that this is something that the 
       community as a whole needs to understand, thus the author is prepared to open
       the floodgates again, in particular due to the decision to hold yet another meeting 
       in a remote location (IETF-86) in Orlando, without consideration of these requirements.</t>

    <!-- Introduction -->

    <section anchor="sec:terminology" title="Conventions and Terminology">
      <t>This document uses the following terms:
      
      
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Celiac disease:">
              A medical condition which requires a diet entirely free of 
              wheat, rye, barley and most oats.
              The reaction, as in food allergies, is to the protein in
               these grains, which is gliaden 
              or most often referred
              to as gluten.  Of particular concern for this dietary 
              restriction is that even the smallest
              amount of the offending food can trigger the manifestion of the 
              illness. This website 
              provides an excellent overview: &lt;http://celiac.nih.gov/&gt;
              </t>
              
            <t hangText="Food additives:">
              Anything added to food which is typically not natural in 
              origin, such as artificial flavors,
              artificial colors/dyes, nitrates/nitrites, sufites/sulfates,
               mono-sodium glutamate (MSG). 
              This list is
              not comprehensive and some of these additives (i.e., the 
              latter three) are naturally 
              occurring in foods,
              however, the levels/volume
              of the substance is a fraction of what is typically added to foods.

            </t>
            <t hangText="Food allergies:">
              Typically refers to a food to which one has a fairly immediate 
              and sometimes anaphylactic
              reaction.  These allergies are typically recognized in that folks
               produced IgE antibodies to
              a specific food. There are also foods in which the reaction is
               delayed and one 
              typically produces IgG antibodies.
              There are also acute mucousal reactions such as to gluten, in which 
              case IgA antibodies are produced.
              It is not uncommon for folks with food allergies to also 
              have food intolerances.

            </t>
            <t hangText="Food intolerances:">
               Food intolerances can be less severe than food allergies in 
               that the reaction is often delayed
              and isn't typically life threatening. The reactions cover a 
              very broad range of symptoms such as 
              gastrointestinal
              reactions (e.g., from dairy or gluten), oral reactions (swelling,
               mouth ulcers, etc.) 
              flu-like symptoms such as overall muscle aches, headaches, 
              fatigue, sinus congestion, etc.
              In a small subset of folks, there can be fairly severe 
              neurological impacts 
              producing ADD/ADHD symptoms, severe anger,
              seizures, etc.
            </t>
            
            <t hangText="Halal:">
              Halal is commonly used to refer to food that is permissible
               according to Islamic law and is 
              special diet followed by most Muslims.  One of the areas of most 
              concern for this diet is the
              source and processing of meat. In one sense, the Halal 
              requirements are extremely close to 
              Kashrut standards followed by those who consume a Kosher Diet.  
              As with a Kosher diet, pork
              is never acceptable.
            </t>

            <t hangText="Healthy:">
              In the most general sense, healthy refers to a diet that is
               typically void of processed foods,
              highly processed sweeteners, food additives, food preservatives, 
              hydrogenated oils, etc.
               In some cases
              folks such as those on Vegetarian and Vegan diets would add 
              animal fats to this list. 
              And, obviously,
              foods with wheat are not considered healthy for celiacs, 
              even foods with natural 
              sweeteners are often
              unhealthy and of course, any food to which one is allergic is
               not healthy.
              So, in this document, the terms is used to refer to a diet
               based on vegetables
               and some fruits, along
              with appropriate proteins, grains, and healthy fats, all of 
              which are suitable for a variety of 
              special diets. 
            </t>
            
             <t hangText="Kosher:">
              A Kosher diet is based on specific rules for food source, 
              preparation and handling 
              that are typically
              followed by many Jews.  The strictest rules are around the
               source and preparation 
              of meats. In particular
              meat and dairy must not be mixed and in most cases utensils that have 
              been used to prepare non-Kosher 
              foods cannot be used. Pork is considered non-kosher. 
            </t>
            
             <t hangText="Phenylketonuria (PKU):">
              A medical condition requiring a low protein diet and avoidance 
              of any food containing 
              phenylalanine (e.g., aspartame).  The diet for PKU is often comprised of
              large amounts of fruits and vegetables in specific portions since the daily 
              intake of protein
              must be monitored.  Grains can be consumed in moderation.   The manner in which the 
              food is prepared must be known as
              ingredients used in cooking and added prior to serving (e.g., butter) need to 
              be identified as they can contribute to the total amount of protein.             
            </t> 

            
             <t hangText="Special Diet:">
              Special Diet: Refers to any diet for which the source, method of preparation, 
              handling and serving of
              the food must all be known. In this document, this term is used to 
              refer to any of the dietary restrictions
              discussed. 
            </t>
            
            <t hangText="Vegan:">
              A Vegan diet entirely excludes the use of animals for food 
              (including animal by-products such as 
              cow's milk, butter, eggs, honey, etc.). 
              Many folks adopt a completely vegan lifestyle and eschew the use of
               animals or animal
              by-products for any purpose (e.g., no leather shoes).  In terms of dietary
               restrictions, one can
              view a vegan diet to be a subset of a vegetarian diet.

            </t>
            <t hangText="Vegetarian:">
              A vegetarian diet is one which excludes the consumption of meat products, 
              usually including fish. 
              Some vegetarian diets also exclude animal by-products such as egg and
               dairy. Vegetarians that do 
              consume egg and dairy products are sometimes referred to as 
              lactoOvo-vegetarians and those that 
              consume dairy products, but no eggs, are referred to as lacto-vegetarians.

    <section anchor="dietReq" title="Requirements for Special Diets">
      

      <t>
        In terms of the number of folks that require special diets, it is 
        estimated that anywhere from 3% to 7%
        of the population has food allergies.  The top eight allergens are: 
        milk (cow), eggs, peanuts, 
        tree nuts (such as almonds, cashews, walnuts), fish (such as bass, cod, 
        flounder), 
        shellfish (such as crab, lobster, shrimp), soy and wheat. It should be
         noted that the allergic reactions 
        are to the protein found in the food. For example, an allergy to milk is
         most often due to casein,
        which is
        the most common protein found in cow's milk.  Thus, any other food product 
        that also contains
        casein (e.g., butter and cheese) can also cause an allergic reaction. 
        While intolerances to specific foods
        may not elicit a true allergic reaction, individuals with food intolerances typcially must 
        also avoid the offending food.  For example, some individuals are lactose intolerant and thus
        they also cannot consume cow's milk as described on the following website: 
        &lt;http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance/&gt;.</t>
        
        <t> 
        A wide range of research has shown that about 10% of the population
        prefer to eat a healthy diet.
        It
        is quite often the more educated of the population that have a preference for
         consuming a healthy diet.
        Thus, it is estimated that at
        least 10 percent of the IETF participants would take advantage of healthy food 
        offerings. A subset of
        the folks in the healthy diet category may choose a vegetarian or vegan diet. 
        It's estimated that about
        5 percent of the U.S. population is vegetarian and about 0.2 percent of the U.S. 
        Population being vegan. 
        Twenty-five percent of the population has the genetic predisposition
        to develop celiac disease. It is estimated that as little as 0.3 percent of the 
        individuals with
        celiac disease
        have been diagnosed.
        Both the U.S. and Europe are actively working to educate the medical community 
        on the high prevalence of undiagnosed celiac. In some countries, the rate of diagnosis has 
        doubled in recent years.
        This trend is expected to continue, thus as time goes by the need for food accomodating this
         diet will increase.  As of 2009, about 15% of the U.S. Population were following a gluten-free 
         diet.   Western Europeans and those of European 
         descent experience the 
        highest incidence of Celiac disease. Although, it is not specific to those ethnic groups
        and has been found in all populations around the world.    
        A conservative estimate is that currently, at least 20% of the 
        North American and European IETF attendees
        would need to follow a special diet of some sort.  Note, that it is difficult to 
        find specific numbers in this area as very little of the medical research (typically 
        just celiac research) actually focuses
        on the association of diet and health and as noted previously, there remain many 
        that still have not 
        been diagnosed with celiac disease. </t>
 
      <t>
        Dietary restrictions for religious reasons include those who follow Halal, Kosher 
        and some folks that 
        follow Vegan/Vegetarian diets.
        Halal is commonly used to refer to food that is permissible according to Islamic law and is
        special diet followed by most Muslims.  One of the areas of most concern for this diet 
        is the
        source and processing of meat. In one sense, the Halal requirements are extremely close to
        Kashrut standards followed by those who consume a Kosher Diet.  As with a Kosher diet, pork
        is never acceptable for a Halal diet.  Fish with scales are considered both Halal 
        and Kosher.  
        Shell fish are controversial and are a common allergen, thus recommended to be 
        avoided as part of 
        planning for foods
        to accomodate a broad range of dietary restrictions. 
      </t>

      <t>
        Dietary restrictions due to medical conditions impose very stringent requirements on the
        food, in particular for allergies and food intolerances.  Celiac disease is a good example 
        of a medical condition
        that requires extreme care in the preparation and handling of the food.
        In many cases, this requires that the food is not processed or prepared anywhere 
        near those grains.
        For example,
        it would not be appropriate to use the utensils, 
        bowls or pots/pans that have been used to prepare foods containing
        those grains without thoroughly cleaning and only metal or glass should be 
        used since trace amounts of the grains
        can attach to plastics and wood. For example, this means that neither plastic 
        nor wood cutting boards that have
        been used for these grains can be used. Nor, can the foods be prepared in the 
        same area or even near an area where
        the grains are being used for food preparation. In general, this requires 
        designating ahead of time a specific
        area to be used for the preparation of these foods and ensuring that the food 
        preparer and anyone that handles
        or serves the food uses appropriate methods to avoid cross contamination.  In 
        terms of serving the food, 
        providing plastic utensils and dishes, while not environmentally friendly, 
        helps to avoid one 
        potential area of cross contamination for most of the diets. 
      </t>

      <t>
        In general, the same rules that are required for handling food for medically 
        restricted diets applies
        to all other special diets in terms of avoiding cross contamination. Meat products 
        require special
        consideration in ensuring that food suitable for vegetarians/vegans is not contaminated, 
        that appropriate
        meat products are provided for folks on Kosher/Halal diets and that the meat products 
        are unprocessed and
        thus suitable for most allergy/intolerance special diets, with the obvious exception 
        that folks that 
        are allergic to fish can't eat fish, etc..
      </t>

      <t>
        There are laws in many countries and jurisdictions (e.g.,U.S., E.U.) that make it 
        illegal to
        mislabel foods that are Halal or Kosher. At this time, 
        food manufacturers in many jusisdictions (e.g.,U.S., U.K, E.U.)  must 
        include all ingredients on the labels of 
        any packaged food product.  The following are examples of the requirements 
        for such: &lt:http://food.gov.uk:80/foodlabelling/&gt;, 
        &lt;http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/index_en.htm&gt;,
        &lt;http://www.fda.gov/food/labelingnutrition/default.htm&gt;. 
        Many products also contain designations as to whether the 
        product is vegetarian
        or vegan, however, the standards for these labels are not as clearly specified 
        or restricted. Manufacturers 
        are required to specifically label the food if it contains any of the top 8 allergens.  
      </t>

      <t> In terms of detailed information available to food service establishments in order 
      to accomodate these 
      special diets, the (U.S.) National Restaurant Association <xref target="NRA"/> has
       produced a comprehensive 
      guide for food service establishments
      to ensure that they appropriately handle food specifically for allergies and 
      intolerance, but could
      be used to avoid cross contamination and ensure that only "safe" foods are served. </t>

      <t>The fundamental requirements for the provision of food to accomodate special 
      diets consists of the
      following:</t>
      
      <t> 
        <list style="numbers">
          <t> The meetings should be held in a location 
          where markets that sell foods for special diets
          are conveniently located. </t> 
          <t> The right food should be accessible to the participants at the meeting venue. 
         </t>
          <t> Food that is served at the venue should be
          prepared and served by appropriate methods as described 
          above. 
          </t>
          <t> The meeting coordination and venue staff should be made 
          aware of participants requiring such food and should be willing 
          to accomodate such requirements. </t>
        </list>

       but applies to anyone involved in this role. </t>
       <t> The IETF organization and individuals that handle the coordination of the meetings
       such as the meeting registrations and other 
       logistics, as well, coordination for the provisions at the meeting venue, as described in

    <section anchor="venues" title="Venue Selection">
    <t> Accomodating the requirements for special diets starts with the selection of the venue.  
    The following describes some criteria and suggestions that can significantly impact 
    the availability of foods 
    for special diets relative to the venue.  It is recommended that these critera and
    suggestions, in order of priority be considered as 
    part of the evaluation and negotiation process in the selection of a venue. </t> 
    <t>
    <list style="numbers">
    <t> Accessiblity to "healthy" food:  
    Meetings that are located in the city center of large metropolitan 
    areas significantly 
    increase the accessibility to foods for special diets. Food markets are generally 
    within walking distance
    and the number of restaurant options improve the potential for a healthy meal.  
    In addition, the opening
    hours for food markets don't entirely overlap with meeting times, 
    thus allowing the attendee to 
    find healthy/safe food without having to miss a meeting (which is the primary 
    objective in attending 
    the meetings for most attendees). </t>
    
    <t> Onsite accomodations: While the location of the meeting dramatically impacts the 
    availability of food 
    near the meeting venue, the logistics of the meetings do require the accessibility to
    healthy/safe food 
    during the meetings. The folks that negotiate the contract should ensure that the 
    venue is willing and
    able to make accomodations for basic requirements in <xref target="dietReq" /> .  
    Information as to the number of attendees for whom the accomodations 
    are required can be based on the information available from previous meetings, with 
    updated information
    provided once the majority of the registrations for the meeting have been completed.
    In addition, folks that negotiate the contract should ensure that attendees are allowed
    to bring in outside food and beverage.  This is a necessity in the case that the venue 
    fails to provide adequate food onsite. More importantly, it is a medical necessity for some 
    folks to always have specific types of food and drink
    readily available (e.g., for diabetics or others with blood sugar issues). 
    </t>
    <t> Repeat venues: Meetings that are located where previous meetings have been held can
    greatly faciliate (or dramatically inhibit) the accessiblity
    to safe/healthy foods.  
    The attendees from previous meeting (s) 
    already have the information on accessibility to the healthy/safe foods which should influence
    venue selection. If the post-meeting surveys include questions as to the availaability 
    of foods for these
    specific diets at the venue, the folks that select the venue know a priori whether 
    the venue is suitable
    in this respect.  For cases of first time attendees for a specific location, 
    relevant information can be gathered from attendees that have previously
    visited the city. </t>

    <section anchor="planners" title="Meeting Coordination">
      <t> IETF meeting coordination staff are typically pro-active in meeting the needs
      of folks with special dietary restrictions when they've been made aware. 
      The meeting registration form includes a field for participants 
      to indicate dietary restrictions. Accomodations including the following have 
      been provided:</t>
      <t> 
      <list style="symbols">
      <t> At one venue that served many cookies with nuts, the meeting staff was able to 
      ask the food service
      staff at the meeting venue to have some nut free cookies available and labeled as such. </t>
      <t> The staff
      are very accomodating in ensuring special meals are provided to participants that attend 
      meetings where meals are provided in cases where they have been made aware (e.g.,  
      WG chairs lunch). </t>
      <t> The availability of safe/healthy foods at the breaks has increased.
      For example, frozen fruit bars have been available at the traditional Thursday
      ice cream social and veggies have been available at some of the afternoon breaks. </t>

            accessiblity to such in nearby markets/restaurants.  These
            accomodations should be available starting on the Friday nite prior to the meeting week,

          this situation intervention should only be required in cases where the participant
          has done their part with regards to the necessary accomodations for their special 
          diet per <xref target="Participants" />.

          <t>
            Since IETF meetings are typically held at full service venues,
            accomodating special diets is a service that can typically be provided, in
            particular with advance notice that allows the venue to properly plan. Planning
            is required to ensure that the basic requirements identified in <xref target="dietReq" />
          </t>

          <t>
            The following summarizes the recommendations for special diets that
            the venue coordinator and food service staff should be able to accomodate
            with some pre-planning and meet all the requirements:</t>
          
          <t>
            <list style="numbers">
              <t> Agreement with meeting planners during the contract negotiation phase

              <t>Ensuring that specific foods for special diets is purchased in time

              <t> Training chefs if necessary to ensure food for special diets is 
              properly prepared. Noting, that
              the majority of chefs
              receive training to accomodate special diets. There is a food service training guide 
              published by 
              the National Restaurant Association (the other NRA) <xref target="NRA"/> 
              that provides explicit details 
              for restaurants in accomodating food allergies that applies generally to other
               dietary restrictions.

              <t>
                Training waitstaff on the need to clearly document the special dietary 
                requirements when food is
                ordered.
              </t>
              <t>
                Training waitstaff to effectively communicate with the food preparers and servers 
                (which are not always the
                waitstaff in some food service locations) to ensure that the preparation,
                 handling and serving of the food
                for the specific dietary restriction is understood.
              </t>
              <t> During the meeting, ensuring food that is available at 
              evening reception, 
              breakfast and 
              snacks 
              is arranged to avoid cross-contamination.  
              Items of particular concern are ensuring that 
              products with nuts are clearly labeled and not co-mingled 
              with nut-free products, meat products
              are separate from dairy products, wheat products (e.g., bread, bagels, muffins, etc.)
              are separated from safe food items such as fruit
              and ideally a list of ingredients is readily available for any prepared foods.
             </t>
             <t> Allowing outside food and beverage.  While all the items listed above dramatically
             increase the accessiblity to safe food, there will still be times that an attendee
             cannot ascertain whether certain foods are safe and thus cannot be consumed. In
             addition, certain medical conditions require that attendees always have specific
             types of food and 
             beverages on hand (e.g., diabetics and others with blood sugar issues).  </t>

          <t> While this list might seem quite onerous, a similar approach is 
          used by a 
          variety of organizations including 
          public schools, overnight summer camps for kids, airlines that 
          still provide meals for international

        <t>

        <list style="numbers">

          <t>
            Ensuring that the accomodations booked for the meeting can accomodate
            any food or medication which requires special handling such as 
            refrigeration  (e.g., insulin for
            diabetics and any other supplements, medications or foods which are important
            for other special diets). Many hotels will provide a refrigerator in the room.
            Some hotels have microwaves in the rooms or in common areas. In many cases,
            it can be a really good idea to stay at a hotel near the venue, where
            food preparation items and refrigerators are standard. For example, there
            was a Marriott Residence Inn right next to the meeting venue in Philadelphia.
            The room rate was identical. There were also two Whole Foods markets within
            walking distance. Thus, for folks on special diets, we really had an optimal
            setup. Typically, the Marriott Residence Inns and Hilton's Homewood Suites
            will also do shopping for you (with a list provided in the room).
          </t>
          <t>
            Bringing special dietary items (including medications, etc.)
            that are typically not generally available, especially in airports or when
            arriving off hours in an unfamilar location, in
            carry on luggage. It is often very, very helpful (and sometimes necessary) to
            have a letter from your healthcare provider documenting the need to travel
            with these items. Also, this will typically allow you to go through security
            with a freezie pack in a lunch cooler.</t>
            
          <t> Indicating the dietary restriction when registering for the IETF meeting.</t>

          <t>
            Monitoring the IETF "food" mailing list for information as to availability of
            specific special diet foods, including food markets, nearby food service
            establishments, as well as at the venue.

          <t> Gathering the available special diet information upon arriving at the venue.</t>
          <t>
            Sharing information on the IETF "food" or IETF meeting specific mailing list
            as to local food service establishments and markets near the venue during the meeting.
          </t>
          <t>
            Communicating effectively with the food service personnel your specific 
            dietary needs.
            While the expectation is that the venue and meeting planners 
            have done their job, ensuring
            that one gets the right food requires effective communication every 
            step of the way. Thus,
            the same approach that one uses elsewhere should also be used 
            at the meetings. One can never
            assume that everything has been taken care of by someone else. And, as
             with anything that
            involves many people doing the right thing, there is always room for human error.
            A very effective tool for communicating this information are food allergy cards available
            on several websites, some of which allow you to enter all your restrictions and print
            them yourself. Others are pre-printed and purchased from the vendor.
            These cards can be given to
            the food service staff. This is very helpful for staff that are unfamiliar with handling
            special dietary requests, as oftentimes these cards trigger a visit from the chef. In
            virtually all cases a discussion with the chef on your dietary requirements results in
            the precise food that you have require.
          </t>
          <t>
            Thanking the folks that do take the effort during the meeting to accomodate your
            special dietary needs and
            ensuring that the food service staff are adequately tipped in locales for which
            this is a custom.

        <section anchor="Sample" title="Specific Food Recommendations">
          <t>
            While specific foods for the special diets can be quite diverse 
            and sometimes contradictory
            (e.g., meat for vegans/vegetarians, seitan for celiacs, etc.), 
            there are also sufficient readily 
            available 
            foods that can meet the requirements of the majority of the special diets. 
             There are a plethora
            of recipes in cookbooks and on websites that address all these various diets, 
            including many that combine the diets,
            such as      <xref target="kosher-veg"/>. The Cornucopia
            restaurant in Dublin <xref target="cornucopia"/> is a perfect example 
            of how this can be done
            in an extremely cost-effective
            efficient and gastronomically appealing manner. Stores such as Whole Foods, 
            with locations in
            virtually all major U.S. cities, as well as in the U.K.,  typically handle 
            this in an
            exceptional manner, as well, as they often have a salad bar section that 
            consists of very plain and
            clearly labeled foods. Most Whole Foods stores also have lists of 
            specific foods in the store
            that are safe for a variety of special diets.  Many airlines that 
            provide special meals typically use
            the same basic meal to accomodate all special diets, in many cases just substituting 
            an alternative protein
            such as the ubiquitous portobello mushroom for the meat to accomodate a 
            vegetarian/vegan diet. 
            Also, many restaurants do have a subset of their menu that can typically
            accomodate special diets and in many cases the menus either label the items 
            as such or include 
            a note indicating that dishes can be prepared to accomodate dietary restrictions. 
          </t>
          
          
          <t>
            The following summarizes some basic foods that can accomodate the majority of 
            special diets that
            the venue coordinator and food service staff should be able to accomodate
            with little pre-planning since they are the foods that provide the basis for 
            most healthy diets. In addition, almost all of these items require very little
            preparation, thus the potential for cross-contamination is fairly low by observing
            the basics of a clean prep area and clean utensils, etc. Also, many of these items
            can be delivered by the food service distributors ready for serving 
            (e.g., salads and even some meats). Virtually
            all the foods can be served cold, as most folks find a cold meal acceptable 
            for breakfast and 
            lunch since dinners at IETF meetings tend to be larger, hot meals:
            <t>
              <list style="symbols">
                <t> A variety of fresh fruits available at breakfast, lunch and for
                 breaks, when cookies, etc.
                are served. The fruit must be kept separate from the cookies, etc. 
                to avoid cross-contamination.</t>
                <t> A variety of fresh vegetables, either served raw or steamed and served plain,
                available at lunch either on a buffet or on the menu.</t>
                <t> At least two greens (without preservatives) for a salad base available at lunch
                and dinner - e.g., Romaine and spinach -
                served separately
                as some folks cannot tolerate the oxalates in fresh spinach.</t>
                <t> Lean proteins such as beans, steamed fish and steamed, grilled or deli 
                meats such as chicken or beef,
                with at least one kosher option and ensuring that the meats are unseasoned
                 and without fillers. Note, that
                the meats can be served cold, thus prepared the night before 
                and actually this may be very economical
                for the food service establishment where fresh foods are typically 
                more desireable - e.g., fish spoils
                most quickly, thus cooking what's left from the dinner
                the night before is economical and efficient.
                For some
                folks, these foods are eaten for both breakfast and lunch.
                </t>
                <t> Also, to accomodate folks that can handle
                various spices and seasonings with their food, a range of condiments such as 
                the basic salt and pepper, ketchup, mustard,
                mayonnaise and Tabasco sauce, as well as minimal salad dressings such as 
                vinegar and oil.
                These items are readily available at virtually any food service
                establishment.</t>
                <t> Within the food preparation environment for these foods and in the case of
                 buffets, avoiding dairy
                altogether is recommended as it is a common allergen, not eaten by vegans, has 
                special rules for a
                Kosher/Halal diet, 50 percent of celiacs cannot tolerate dairy and the 
                most health conscious
                of people typically recognize that cow's milk, 
                pastuerized in particular, is not a particularly healthy food.</t>
              </list>
            </t>

          </t>



          <t>
            The following food options would be nice to have available, but 
            may require some pre-planning
            depending upon the venue, but in general can be purchased/prepared 
            ahead of time, thus should
            not be particularly difficult to support:
            <t>
              <list style="symbols">

                <t>
                  Alternative grains such as Quinoa - can be served as a hot 
                  breakfast cereal or served
                  as a side dish as an alternative to rice or cracked wheat salad (Tabbouleh) - the 
                  latter could be made using
                  leftovers from breakfast. In the case of breakfast, side options such as 
                  maple syrup and dried fruits like
                  raisins can be used to sweeten (in the same manner as these items are 
                  served with oatmeal).
                </t>
                <t> Rice crackers as an alternative to wheat based grain products.</t>
                <t>
                  Hummus as a protein alternative for breakfast and lunch.  Hummus keeps quite well, 
                  thus the food
                  service staff would only need to prepare a large enough batch to last the week.
                </t>
                <t>  Sprouted beans as a salad/protein alternative for breakfast and lunch.</t>
                <t>
                  Soups that would accomodate all diets such as non-dairy Squash or 
                  vegan lentil soup.
                  As with the meats, this soup
                  could be made with leftovers served from the previous evening.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Nuts and seeds (e.g., pumpkin, sunflower, etc.), including nut butters,
                  as alternative protein sources for folks.  These are suitable for 
                  all meals and snacks.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Snack bars as an alternative to the cookie option at breaks. There is 
                  a wide range of
                  healthy snack bars available, with many being either free of all allergens, 
                  vegan and kosher or
                  at least accomodating 2 of the 3 main restrictions. For example, bars with 
                  honey are not vegan,
                  but may be suitable for all the other special diets. Many of the manufacturers of 
                  these snack
                  bars will provide a certain number to non-profit organizations for their events 
                  for marketing and
                  as a public service.
