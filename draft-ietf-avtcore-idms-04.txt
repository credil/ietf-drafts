            RTCP for inter-destination media synchronization
                       draft-ietf-avtcore-idms-04

Abstract

   This document gives information on an RTCP Packet Type and RTCP XR
   Block Type including associated SDP parameters for Inter-Destination
   Media Synchronization (IDMS).  The RTCP XR Block Type, registered
   with IANA based on an ETSI specification, is used to collect media
   playout information from participants in a group playing-out
   (watching, listening, etc.) a specific RTP media stream.  The RTCP
   packet type specified by this document is used to distribute a common
   target playout point to which all the distributed receivers, sharing
   a media experience, can synchronize.

   Typical use cases in which IDMS is usefull are social TV, shared
   service control (i.e. applications where two or more geographically
   separated users are watching a media stream together), distance
   learning, networked video walls, networked loudspeakers, etc.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Inter-Destination Media Synchronization

   Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS) refers to the playout
   of media streams at two or more geographically distributed locations
   in a time synchronized manner.  It can be applied to both unicast and
   multicast media streams and can be applied to any type and/or
   combination of streaming media, such as audio, video and text
   (subtitles).[Ishibashi2006] and [Boronat2009] provide an overview of
   technologies and algorithms for IDMS.

   IDMS requires the exchange of information on media receipt and
   playout times among participants in an IDMS session.  It may also
   require signaling for the initiation and maintenance of IDMS sessions
   and groups of receivers.

   The presented RTCP specification for IDMS is independent of the used
   synchronization algorithm, which is out-of-scope of this document.

1.2.  Applicability of RTCP to IDMS

   Currently, a large share of real-time applications make use of RTP
   and RTCP [RFC3550].  RTP provides end-to-end network transport
   functions suitable for applications requiring real-time data
   transport, such as audio, video or data, over multicast or unicast
   network services.  The timestamps, sequence numbers, and payload
   (content) type identification mechanisms provided by RTP packets are
   very useful for reconstructing the original media timing, and for
   reordering and detecting packet loss at the client side.

   The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow
   monitoring of the data delivery in a manner that is scalable to large
   multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification
   functionality.  RTP receivers and senders provide reception quality
   feedback by sending out RTCP Receiver Report (RR) and Sender Report
   (SR) packets [RFC3550], respectively, which may be augmented by
   eXtended Reports (XR) [RFC3611].  Both RTP and RTCP are intended to
   be tailored through modifications in order to include profile-
   specific information required by particular applications, and the
   guidelines on doing so are specified in [RFC5868].

   IDMS involves the collection, summarizing and distribution of RTP
   packet arrival and playout times.  As information on RTP packet
   arrival times and playout times can be considered reception quality
   feedback information, RTCP is well suited for carrying out IDMS,
   which may facilitate the implementation and deployment in typical
   multimedia applications.

1.3.  Applicability of SDP to IDMS

   RTCP XR [RFC3611] defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
   the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
   packets can be signaled by an application using the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].

   SDP signaling is used to set up and maintain a synchronization group
   between Synchronization Clients (SCs).  This document describes two
   SDP parameters for doing this, one for the RTCP XR block type and one
   for the new RTCP packet type.

1.4.  This document and ETSI TISPAN

   ETSI TISPAN [TS183063] has specified architecture and protocol for
   IDMS using RTCP XR exchange and SDP signaling.  For more information
   on how this document relates to [TS183063], see Section 11.

   Alice is watching TV in her living room.  At some point she sees that
   a football game of Bob's favorite team is on.  She sends him an
   invite to watch the program together.  Embedded in the invitation is
   the link to the media server and a unique sync-group identifier.

   Bob, who is also at home, receives the invite on his laptop.  He
   accepts Alice's invitation and the RTP client on his laptop sets up a
   session to the media server.  A VoIP connection to Alice's TV is also
   set up, so that Alice and Bob can talk while watching the game
   together.

   As is common with RTP, both the RTP client in Alice's TV as well as
   the one in Bob's laptop send periodic RTCP Receiver Reports (RR) to
   the media server.  However, in order to make sure Alice and Bob see
   the events in the football game at (approximately) the same time,
   their clients also periodically send an IDMS XR block to the sync
   server function of the media server.  Included in the XR blocks are
   timestamps on when both Alice and Bob received (or played out) a
   particular RTP packet.

   The sync server function in the media server calculates a reference
   client from the received IDMS XR blocks (e.g. by selecting whichever
   client received the packet the latest as the reference client).  It
   then sends an RTCP IDMS packet containing the playout information of
   this reference client to the sync clients of both Alice and Bob.

   In this case Bob has the slowest connection and the reference client
   therefore includes a delay similar to the one experienced by Bob.
   Upon reception of this information, Alice's RTP client can choose
   what to do with this information.  In this case it decreases its
   playout rate temporarily until it matches with the reference client
   playout (and thus matches Bob's playout).  Another option for Alice's
   TV would be to simply pause playback until it catches up.  The exact
   implementation of the synchronization algorithm is up to the client.

   Upon reception of the reference client RTCP IDMS packet, Bob's client
   does not have to do anything since it is already synchronized to the
   reference client (since it is based on Bob's delay).  Note that other
   synchronization algorithms may introduce even more delay than the one
   experienced by the most delayed client, e.g. to account for delay
   variations, for new clients joining an existing synchronization
   group, etc.


4.  Inter-Destination Media Synchronization use cases

   There are a large number of use cases imaginable in which IDMS might
   be useful.  This section will highlight some of them.  It should be
   noted that this section is in no way meant to be exhaustive.

   A first usage scenario for IDMS is Social TV.  Social TV is the
   combination of media content consumption by two or more users at
   different devices and locations and real-time communication between
   those users.  An example of Social TV, is when two or more users are
   watching the same television broadcast at different devices and
   locations, while communicating with each other using text, audio
   and/or video.  A skew in their media playout processes can have
   adverse effects on their experience.  A well-known use case here is
   one friend experiencing a goal in a football match well before or
   after other friend(s).

   Another potential use case for IDMS is a networked video wall.  A
   video wall consists of multiple computer monitors, video projectors,
   or television sets tiled together contiguously or overlapped in order
   to form one large screen.  Each of the screens reproduces a portion
   of the larger picture.  In some implementations, each screen may be
   individually connected to the network and receive its portion of the
   overall image from a network-connected video server or video scaler.
   Screens are refreshed at 60 hertz (every 16-2/3 milliseconds) or
   potentially faster.  If the refresh is not synchronized, the effect
   of multiple screens acting as one is broken.

   A third usage scenario is that of the networked loudspeakers, in
   which two or more speakers are connected to the network individually.

   Such situations can for example be found in large conference rooms,
   legislative chambers, classrooms (especially those supporting
   distance learning) and other large-scale environments such as
   stadiums.  Since humans are more susceptible to differences in audio
   delay, this use case needs even more accuracy than the video wall use
   case.  Depending on the exact application, the need for accuracy can
   then be in the range of microseconds.


5.  Architecture for Inter-Destination Media Synchronization

   The architecture for IDMS, which is based on a sync-maestro
   architecture [Boronat2009], is sketched below.  The Synchronization
   Client (SC) and Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS)
   entities are shown as additional functionality for the RTP receiver
   and sender respectively.

   It should be noted that a master/slave type of architecture is also
   supported by having one of the SC devices also act as an MSAS.  In
   this case the MSAS functionality is thus embedded in an RTP receiver
   instead of an RTP sender.

5.1.  Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS)

   An MSAS collects RTP packet arrival times and playout times from one
   or more SC(s) in a synchronization group.  The MSAS summarizes and
   distributes this information to the SCs in the synchronization group
   as synchronization settings, e.g. by determining the SC with the most
   lagged playout and using its reported RTP packet arrival time and
   playout time as a summary.

5.2.  Synchronization Client (SC)

   An SC reports on RTP packet arrival times and playout times of a
   media stream.  It can receive summaries of such information, and use
   that to adjust its playout buffer.

5.3.  Communication between MSAS and SCs

   Two different message types are used for the communication between
   MSAS and SCs.  For the SC->MSAS message containing the play-out
   information of a particular client, an RTCP XR Block Type is used
   (see Section 6).  For the MSAS->SC message containing the
   synchronization settings instructions, a new RTCP Packet Type is
   defined (see Section 7).


6.  RTCP XR Block Type for IDMS

   This section describes the RTCP XR Block Type for reporting IDMS
   information on an RTP media stream.  Its definition is based on
   [RFC3611].  The RTCP XR is used to provide feedback information on
   receipt times and presentation times of RTP packets to e.g. a Sender
   [RFC3611], a Feedback Target [RFC5760] or a Third Party Monitor
   [RFC3611].

Internet-Draft                RTCP for IDMS                     May 2012


   The first 64 bits form the header of the RTCP XR, as defined in
   [RFC3611].  The SSRC of packet sender identifies the sender of the
   specific RTCP packet.

   The IDMS report block consists of 8 32-bit words, with the following
   fields:

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits.  It identifies the block format.  Its value
   SHALL be set to 12.

   Synchronization Packet Sender Type (SPST): 4 bits.  This field
   identifies the role of the packet sender for this specific eXtended
   Report.  It can have the following values:

      SPST=0 Reserved For future use.

      SPST=1 The packet sender is an SC.  It uses this XR to report
      synchronization status information.  Timestamps relate to the SC
      input.

      SPST=2 This setting is reserved in order to preserve compatibility
      with ETSI TISPAN [TS183063].  See Section 11 for more information.

      SPST=3-15 Reserved For future use.

   Reserved bits (Resrv): 3 bits.  These bits are reserved for future
   definition.  In the absence of such a definition, the bits in this
   field MUST be set to zero and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Packet Presented NTP timestamp flag (P): 1 bit.  Bit set to 1 if the
   Packet Presented NTP timestamp field contains a value, 0 if it is
   empty.  If this flag is set to zero, then the Packet Presented NTP
   timestamp SHALL be ignored.

   Block Length: 16 bits.  This field indicates the length of the block
   in 32 bit words minus one and SHALL be set to 7, as this RTCP Block
   Type has a fixed length.

   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits.  This field identifies the format of the
   media payload, according to [RFC3551].  The media payload is
   associated with an RTP timestamp clock rate.  This clock rate
   provides the time base for the RTP timestamp counter.

   Reserved bits (Resrv): 25 bits.  These bits are reserved for future
   use and SHALL be set to 0.

   Media Stream Correlation Identifier: 32 bits.  This identifier is
   used to correlate synchronized media streams.  The value 0 (all bits

   are set "0") indicates that this field is empty.  The value 2^32-1
   (all bits are set "1") is reserved for future use.  If the RTCP
   Packet Sender is an SC (SPST=1) or an MSAS (SPST=2), then the Media
   Stream Correlation Identifier maps on the Synchronization Group
   Identifier (SyncGroupId) to which the report applies.

   SSRC: 32 bits.  The SSRC of the media source SHALL be set to the
   value of the SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of
   the RTP packet to which the XR relates.

   Packet Received NTP timestamp: 64 bits.  This timestamp reflects the
   wall clock time at the moment of arrival of the first octet of the
   RTP packet to which the XR relates.  It is formatted based on the NTP
   timestamp format as specified in [RFC5905].  See Section 8 for more
   information on how this field is used.

   Packet Received RTP timestamp: 32 bits.  This timestamp has the value
   of the RTP timestamp carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of the RTP
   packet to which the XR relates.  Several consecutive RTP packets will
   have equal timestamps if they are (logically) generated at once,
   e.g., belong to the same video frame.  It may well be the case that
   one receiver reports on the first RTP packet having a certain RTP
   timestamp and a second receiver reports on the last RTP packet having
   that same RTP timestamp.  This would lead to an error in the
   synchronization algorithm due to the faulty interpretation of
   considering both reports to be on the same RTP packet.  To solve
   this, an SC SHOULD report on RTP packets in which a certain RTP
   timestamp shows up for the first time.

   Packet Presented NTP timestamp: 32 bits.  This timestamp reflects the
   wall clock time at the moment the data contained in the first octet
   of the associated RTP packet is presented to the user.  It is based
   on the time format used by NTP and consists of the least significant
   16 bits of the NTP seconds part and the most significant 16 bits of
   the NTP fractional second part.  If this field is empty, then it
   SHALL be set to 0 and the Packet Presented NTP timestamp flag (P)
   SHALL be set to 0.  Presented here means the moment the data is
   played out to the user of the system, i.e. sound played out through
   speakers, video images being displayed on some display, etc.  The
   accuracy resulting from the synchronization algorithm will only be as
   good as the accuracy with which the receivers can determine the delay
   between receiving packets and presenting them to the end-user.

   The first 64 bits form the header of the RTCP Packet Type, as defined
   in [RFC3550].  The SSRC of packet sender identifies the sender of the
   specific RTCP packet.

   The RTCP IDMS packet consists of 7 32-bit words, with the following
   fields:

   SSRC: 32 bits.  The SSRC of the media source SHALL be set to the
   value of the SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of
   the RTP packet to which the RTCP IDMS packet relates.

   Media Stream Correlation Identifier: 32 bits.  This identifier is
   used to correlate synchronized media streams.  The value 0 (all bits
   are set "0") indicates that this field is empty.  The value 2^32-1
   (all bits are set "1") is reserved for future use.  The Media Stream
   Correlation Identifier maps on the SyncGroupId of the group to which
   this packet is sent.

   Packet Received NTP timestamp: 64 bits.  This timestamp reflects the
   wall clock time at the reference client at the moment it received the
   first octet of the RTP packet to which this packet relates.  It can
   be used by the synchronization algorithm on the receiving SC to
   adjust its playout timing in order to achieve synchronization, e.g.
   to set the required playout delay.  The timestamp is formatted based

   on the NTP timestamp format as specified in [RFC5905].  See Section 8
   for more information on how this field is used.

   Packet Received RTP timestamp: 32 bits.  This timestamp has the value
   of the RTP timestamp carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of the RTP
   packet to which the XR relates.  This SHOULD relate to the first
   arriving RTP packet containing this particular RTP timestamp, in case
   multiple RTP packets contain the same RTP timestamp.

   Packet Presented NTP timestamp: 64 bits.  This timestamp reflects the
   wall clock time at the reference client at the moment it presented
   the data contained in the first octet of the associated RTP packet to
   the user.  The timestamp is formatted based on the NTP timestamp
   format as specified in [RFC5905].  If this field is empty, then it
   SHALL be set to 0.  This field MAY be left empty if none or only one
   of the receivers reported on presentation timestamps.  Presented here
   means the moment the data is played out to the user of the system.

   In some use cases (e.g. phased array transducers), the level of
   control an MSAS might need to have over the exact moment of playout
   is so precise that a 32bit Presented Timestamp will not suffice.  For
   this reason, this RTCP Packet Type for IDMS includes a 64bit
   Presented Timestamp field.  Since an MSAS will in practice always add
   some extra delay to the delay reported by the most lagged receiver
   (to account for packet jitter), it suffices for the IDMS XR Block
   Type with which the SCs report on their playout to have a 32bit
   Presented Timestamp field.


8.  Timing and NTP Considerations

   To achieve IDMS, the different receivers involved need synchronized
   clocks as a common timeline for synchronization.  Depending on the
   synchronization accuracy required, different clock synchronization
   methods can be used.  For social TV, synchronization accuracy should
   be achieved on the order of hundreds of milliseconds.  In that case,
   correct use of NTP on receivers will in most situations achieve the
   required accuracy.  As a guideline, to deal with clock drift of
   receivers, receivers should synchronize their clocks at the beginning
   of a synchronized session.  In case of high required accuracy, the
   synchronized clocks of different receivers should not drift beyond
   the accuracy required for the synchronization mechanism.  In
   practice, this can mean that receivers need to synchronize their
   clocks repeatedly during a synchronization session.

   Because of the stringent synchronization requirements for achieving
   good audio in some use cases, a high accuracy will be needed.  In
   this case, use of the global NTP system may not be sufficient.  For



van Brandenburg, et al.  Expires November 23, 2012             [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                RTCP for IDMS                     May 2012


   improved accuracy, a local NTP server could be set up, or some other
   more accurate clock synchronization mechanism can be used, such as
   GPS time or the Precision Time Protocol [IEEE-1588].

   [I-D.draft-williams-avtcore-clksrc] defines a set of SDP parameters
   for signaling the clock synchronization source or sources available
   to and used by the individual receivers.  Using these paramenters, an
   SC can indicate which synchronization source is being used at the
   moment, the last time the SC synchronized with this source and the
   synchronization frequency.  An SC can also indicate any other
   synchronization sources available to it.  This allows multiple SCs in
   an IDMS session to use the same or a similar clock source for their
   session.

   Applications performing IDMS may or may not be able to choose a
   synchronization method for the system clock, because this may be a
   system-wide setting which the application cannot change.  How
   applications deal with this is up to the implementation.  The
   application might control the system clock, or it might use a
   separate application clock or even a separate IDMS session clock.  It
   might also report on the system clock and the synchronization method
   used, without being able to change it.

   [I-D.draft-gross-leap-second] presents some guidelines on how RTP
   senders and receivers should deal with leap seconds.  When relying on
   NTP for clock synchronization, IDMS is particularly sensitive to leap
   second induced timing discrepancies.  It is therefore recommended to
   take the guideline specified in [I-D.draft-gross-leap-second] into
   account when implementing IDMS.


9.  SDP Parameter for RTCP XR IDMS Block Type

   The SDP parameter sync-group is used to signal the use of the RTCP XR
   block for IDMS.  It is also used to carry an identifier of the
   synchronization group to which clients belong or will belong.  This
   SDP parameter extends rtcp-xr-attrib as follows, using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form [RFC5234].

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
   ; Original definition from [RFC3611], section 5.1

   xr-format =/ grp-sync ; Extending xr-format for Inter-Destination
   Media Synchronization

   grp-sync = "grp-sync" [",sync-group=" SyncGroupId]

   SyncGroupId = 1*DIGIT ; Numerical value from 0 till 4294967295

Internet-Draft                RTCP for IDMS                     May 2012


   DIGIT = %x30-39

   SyncGroupId is a 32-bit unsigned integer represented in decimal.
   SyncGroupId identifies a group of SCs for IDMS.  It maps on the Media
   Stream Correlation Identifier as described in Section 6 and
   Section 7.  The value SyncGroupId=0 represents an empty SyncGroupId.
   The value 4294967295 (2^32-1) is reserved for future use.

   The following is an example of the SDP attribute for IDMS

   a=rtcp-xr:grp-sync,sync-group=42


10.  SDP Parameter for RTCP IDMS Packet Type

   The SDP parameter rtcp-idms is used to signal the use of the RTCP
   IDMS Packet Type for IDMS.  It is also used to carry an identifier of
   the synchronization group to which clients belong or will belong.
   The SDP parameter is used as a media-level attribute during session
   setup.  This SDP parameter is defined as follows, using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form [RFC5234].

   rtcp-idms = "a=" "rtcp-idms" ":" [sync-grp] CRLF

   sync-grp = "sync-group=" SyncGroupId

   SyncGroupId = 1*DIGIT ; Numerical value from 0 till 4294967295

   DIGIT = %x30-39

   SyncGroupId is a 32-bit unsigned integer and represented in decimal.
   SyncGroupId identifies a group of SCs for IDMS.  The value
   SyncGroupId=0 represents an empty SyncGroupId.  The value 4294967295
   (2^32-1) is reserved for future use.

   The following is an example of the SDP attribute for IDMS.

   a=rtcp-idms:sync-group=42


11.  Compatibility with ETSI TISPAN

   As described in Section 1.4, ETSI TISPAN has also described a
   mechanism for IDMS in [TS183063].  One of the main differences
   between the TISPAN document and this document is the fact that the
   TISPAN solution uses an RTPC XR block for both the SC->MSAS message
   and the MSAS->SC message (by selecting different SPST-types), while
   this document specifies a new RTCP Packet Type for the MSAS->SC



van Brandenburg, et al.  Expires November 23, 2012             [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                RTCP for IDMS                     May 2012


   message.  The message from MSAS to SC is not in any way a report on
   how a receiver sees a session, and therefore a separate RTCP packet
   type is more appropriate than the XR block solution chosen in ETSI
   TISPAN.

   In order to maintain backward-compatibility, the RTCP XR block used
   for SC->MSAS signaling specified in this document is fully compatible
   with the TISPAN defined XR block.

   For the MSAS->SC signaling, it is recommended to use the RTCP IDMS
   Packet Type defined in this document.  The TISPAN XR block with
   SPST=2 MAY be used for purposes of compatibility with the TISPAN
   solution, but MUST NOT be used if all nodes involved support the new
   RTCP IDMS Packet Type.

   The above means that the IANA registry contains two SDP parameters
   for the MSAS->SC signaling; one for the ETSI TISPAN solution and one
   for the IETF solution.  This also means that if all elements in the
   SDP negotiation support the IETF solution they SHOULD use the new
   RTCP IDMS Packet Type.


12.  On the use of presentation timestamps

   A receiver can report on different timing events, i.e. on packet
   arrival times and on playout times.  A receiver SHALL report on
   arrival times and a receiver MAY report on playout times.  RTP packet
   arrival times are relatively easy to report on.  Normally, the
   processing and playout of the same media stream by different
   receivers will take roughly the same amount of time.  It can suffice
   for many applications, such as social TV, to synchronize on packet
   arrival times.  Also, if the receivers are in some way controlled,
   e.g. having the same buffer settings and decoding times, high
   accuracy can be achieved.  However, if all receivers in a
   synchronization session have the ability to report on, and thus
   synchronize on packet presented times, this may be more accurate.  It
   is up to applications and implementations of this RTCP extension
   whether to implement and use this.


13.  Security Considerations

   The specified RTCP XR Block Type in this document is used to collect,
   summarize and distribute information on packet reception- and
   playout-times of streaming media.  The information may be used to
   orchestrate the media playout at multiple devices.

   Errors in the information, either accidental or malicious, may lead



van Brandenburg, et al.  Expires November 23, 2012             [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                RTCP for IDMS                     May 2012


   to undesired behavior.  For example, if one device erroneously
   reports a two-hour delayed playout, then another device in the same
   synchronization group could decide to delay its playout by two hours
   as well, in order to keep its playout synchronized.  A user would
   likely interpret this two hour delay as a malfunctioning service.

   Therefore, the application logic of both Synchronization Clients and
   Media Synchronization Application Servers should check for
   inconsistent information.  Differences in playout time exceeding
   configured limits (e.g. more than ten seconds) could be an indication
   of such inconsistent information.

   No new mechanisms are introduced in this document to ensure
   confidentiality.  Encryption procedures, such as those being
   suggested for a Secure RTP (SRTP) at the time that this document was
   written, can be used when confidentiality is a concern to end hosts.


14.  IANA Considerations

   New RTCP Packet Types and RTCP XR Block Types are subject to IANA
   registration.  For general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP
   XR, refer to [RFC3611].

   [TS 183 063] assigns the block type value 12 in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry to "Inter-Destination Media Synchronization Block".
   [TS183063] also registers the SDP [RFC4566] parameter "grp-sync" for
   the "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry.

   Further, this document defines a new RTCP packet type called IDMS
   report.  This new packet type is registered with the IANA registry of
   RTP parameters, based on the specification in Section 10.

   Further, this document defines a new SDP parameter "rtcp-idms" within
   the existing IANA registry of SDP Parameters.

   The SDP attribute "rtcp-idms" defined by this document is registered
   with the IANA registry of SDP Parameters as follows:

      SDP Attribute ("att-field"):
