Abstract 

   The MPLS label stack has no explicit protocol identifier field to 
   indicate the protocol type of the MPLS payload. This document 
   proposes a mechanism for containing a protocol identifier field 
   within the MPLS packet, which may be useful in some emerging use 
   cases (e.g., network service chain and MPLS payload inspection).

Internet-Draft     MPLS Payload Protocol Identifier      September 2013 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   The MPLS label stack has no explicit protocol identifier field to 
   indicate the protocol type of the MPLS payload. This document 
   proposes a mechanism for containing a protocol identifier field 
   within the MPLS packet, which may be useful in some emerging use 
   cases (e.g., network service chain and MPLS payload inspection).  

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC3032].  

3. Protocol Type Field 

   The encapsulation format for Protocol Type field is depicted as below:

            Protocol Identifier Label (PIL) 

                This field contains a special purpose label with value of 
                <TBD> or an extended special purpose label [SPL] with 
                value of <TBD> which indicates that a Protocol Type field 
                appears immediately after the bottom of the label stack.         

            EXP 

                The usage of this field is in accordance with the                
                current MPLS specification [RFC3032]. 

            S 

                The Bottom of Stack (BoS) field is set since the PIL MUST 
                always appear at the bottom of the label stack.

Internet-Draft     MPLS Payload Protocol Identifier      September 2013 
 
                The usage of this field is in accordance with the                
                current MPLS specification [RFC3032]. 

            Reserved 

                MUST be set to 0 and ignored on reception. 

            Protocol Type 

                This field indicates the protocol type of the MPLS 
                payload as per [ETYPES]. 

            Payload 

                This field contains the MPLS payload which can be an IP 
                packet, an Ethernet frame, or any other type of payload 
                (e.g., network service header). 

4. Data Plane Processing of PIL 

4.1. Egress LSRs 

   Suppose egress LSR Y is capable of processing the Protocol Type field 
   contained in MPLS packets. LSR Y indicates this to all ingress LSRs 
   via signaling (see Section 5). LSR Y MUST be prepared to deal with 
   both packets with an imposed Protocol Type field and those without; 
   the PIL will distinguish these cases. If a particular ingress LSR 
   chooses not to impose a Protocol Type field, LSR Y's processing of 
   the received label stack (which might be empty) is as if LSR Y chose 
   not to accept Protocol Type field.  

   If an ingress LSR X chooses to impose the Protocol Type field, then 
   LSR Y will receive an MPLS packet constructed as follows: <Top Label 
   (TL), Application Label (AL), PIL> <Protocol Type field> <remaining 
   MPLS payload>. Note that here the TL could be replaced with an IP-
   based tunnel [RFC4023] and the AL is optional. 

   LSR Y recognizes TL as the label it distributed to its upstream LSR 
   and pops the TL (note that the TL may be an implicit null label, in 
   which case it doesn't appear in the label stack and LSR Y MUST 
   process the packet starting with the AL label (if present) and/or the 
   PIL.)  LSR Y recognizes the PIL with S bit set.  LSR Y then processes 
   the Protocol Type field, which will determine how LSR Y processes the 
   MPLS payload.

4.2. Ingress LSRs 

   If an egress LSR Y indicates via signaling that it can process the 
   Protocol Type field, an ingress LSR X can choose whether or not to 
   insert it into the MPLS packet destined for LSR Y. The ingress LSR X 
   MUST NOT insert the Protocol Type field into that MPLS packet unless 
   the egress LSR X has explicitly announced that it could process it. 

   The steps that ingress LSR X performs to insert the Protocol Type 
   field are as follows: 

      1.  On an incoming packet, identify the application to which the       
   packet belongs and determine whether the Protocol Type field needs to 
   be added to the incoming packet. 

      2.  For packets requiring the insertion of the Protocol Type field, 
   prepend the Protocol Type field to the existing MPLS payload; then, 
   push the PIL on to the label stack with the S bit set.  

      3.  Push the application label (AL) label (if required) on to the       
   label stack. 

      4.  Push the EL and the ELI labels [RFC6790] on to the label stack 
   (if required). 

      6.  Determine the top label (TL) and push it on to the label stack. 

      7.  Determine the output interface and send the packet out. 

4.3. Transit LSRs  

   Transit LSRs MAY operate with no change in forwarding behavior. If a 
   transit LSR recognizes the PIL and the subsequent Protocol Type field, 
   it MAY be allowed to do some additional value-added processing, such 
   as MPLS payload inspection, on the received MPLS packet containing 
   the PIL and the Protocol Type field. 

4.4. Penultimate Hop LSR 

   No change is needed at penultimate hop LSRs.

   A special purpose label with value of <TBD> or an extended special

   the IANA.
