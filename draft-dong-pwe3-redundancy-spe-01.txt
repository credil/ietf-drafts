Internet-Draft            PW redundancy on S-PE               March 2012


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy] and [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit]
   describe Pseudowire (PW) redundancy mechanism for scenarios where a
   set of redundant PWs terminate on either provider edge (PE) nodes in
   single-segment pseudowire (SS-PW) [RFC3985]applications, or on
   terminating provider edge (T-PE) nodes in multi-segment pseudowire
   (MS-PW) [RFC5659] applications.  This document describes the
   scenarios where PW redundancy is provided on S-PEs of MS-PW.
   Signaling of preferential forwarding defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit] is reused for these scenarios, and
   operations on S-PE are specified.


2.  PW Redundancy on S-PE

   In some MS-PW deployment scenarios, PW redundancy may need to be
   provided on S-PE.  This section gives some examples of PW redundancy
   on S-PE.

                        Figure 1.MS-PW Redundancy on S-PE

   As illustrated in Figure 1, CE1 is connected to T-PE1 while CE2 is
   dual-homed to T-PE2 and T-PE3.  T-PE1 is connected to S-PE1 only, and
   S-PE1 is connected to T-PE2 and T-PE3.  The MS-PW is switched on
   S-PE1, and PW-Seg2 and PW-Seg3 provides resiliency on S-PE1 for
   failure of T-PE2 or T-PE3 or the connected ACs.  PW-Seg2 is selected
   as primary PW segment, and PW-Seg3 is secondary PW segment.

   MS-PW redundancy on S-PE is beneficial for scenario in Figure 1 since
   on T-PE1 side it may be impossible to provide PW redundancy,
   especially when the PW-Seg1 between T-PE1 and S-PE1 is statically
   configured.  For PW redundancy on S-PE, the number of PW segments
   needed between T-PE1 and S-PE1 is only half of the number of PW
   segments needed for End-to-End PW redundancy.  Also PW redundancy on
   S-PE could provide faster protection switching than end-to-end
   protection switching of MS-PW.

          Figure 2. MS-PW Redundancy on S-PE with S-PE protection

   As illustrated in Figure 2, CE1 is connected to T-PE1 while CE2 is
   dual-homed to T-PE2 and T-PE3.  T-PE1 is connected to S-PE1 and
   S-PE2, both S-PE1 and S-PE2 are connected to T-PE2 and T-PE3.  There
   are two MS-PWs which are switched at S-PE1 and S-PE2 respectively to
   provide S-PE node protection.  For MS-PW1, the S-PE1 provides
   resiliency using PW1-Seg2 and PW1-Seg3.  For MS-PW2, the S-PE2
   provides resiliency using PW2-Seg2 and PW2-Seg3.  MS-PW1 is the
   primary PW and PW1-Seg2 is the primary PW segment.

   MS-PW redundancy on S-PE is beneficial for scenario in Figure 2 since
   it reduces the number of end-to-end MS-PWs required for both T-PE and
   S-PE protection.  Also redundancy on S-PE could provide faster
   protection switching than end-to-end protection switching of MS-PW.


3.  S-PE Operations

   When S-PE redundancy is provisioned, it is necessary that S-PE could
   perform protection switching according to the status change of PW
   segments and announce appropriate PW status to adjacent PEs.
   Signaling of preferential forwarding defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit] is reused for these scenarios, and
   operation on S-PE is specified as below.

   For scenario of Figure 1, assume the AC from CE2 to T-PE2 is active.
   if S-PE1 knows PW-Seg1 is in "PW forwarding" State, it would

   advertise "Preferential Forwarding" status bit of "Active" on both
   PW-Seg2 and PW-Seg3.  T-PE2 advertises the preferential status
   "Active" and T-PE3 advertises the preferential status "Standby", by
   matching the local and remote preferential forwarding status, PW-Seg2
   would be used for traffic forwarding.

   On failure of the AC between CE2 and T-PE2, the forwarding state of
   AC on T-PE3 is changed to Active.  T-PE3 would then advertise the
   preferential status "Active" to S-PE1, and T-PE2 would advertise the
   preferential status "Standby".  S-PE1 would perform the switchover
   according to the updated local and remote preferential forwarding
   status, and select PW-Seg3 to forward traffic.  If S-PE selects a new
   Active PW segment successfully, it SHOULD NOT advertise any change of
   the PW status to T-PE1.  Hence T-PE1 would not be aware of the
   failure on the remote side.

   For scenario of Figure 2, assume the AC from CE2 to T-PE2 is active.
   T-PE1 would advertise preferential status "Active" on PW1-Seg1 and
   "Standby" on PW2-Seg1.  According to the received preferential
   status, S-PE1 SHOULD advertise preferential status "Active" on both
   PW1-Seg2 and PW1-Seg3, and S-PE2 SHOULD advertise preferential status
   "Standby" on both PW2-Seg2 and PW2-Seg3.  T-PE2 advertises
   preferential status "Active" on both PW1-Seg2 and PW2-Seg3, and T-PE3
   advertises preferential status "Standby" on both PW1-Seg3 and PW2-
   Seg3.  By matching the local and remote preferential forwarding
   status, PW1-Seg2 would be used for traffic forwarding.  Since S-PE1
   connects to the primary PW segment PW1-Seg2, it would advertise
   preferential status "Active" to T-PE1.  S-PE2 would advertise
   preferential status "Standby" to T-PE1 since it does not connect to
   the primary PW segment.

   On failure of the AC between CE2 and T-PE2, the forwarding state of
   AC on T-PE3 is changed to Active.  T-PE3 would then advertise the
   preferential status "Active" to S-PE1, and T-PE2 would advertise the
   preferential status "Standby".  S-PE1 would perform the switchover
   according to the updated local and remote preferential forwarding
   status, and select PW1-Seg3 to forward traffic.  Since S-PE1 selects
   a new Active PW segment successfully, it SHOULD NOT advertise any
   change of the PW status to T-PE1, and T-PE would not be aware of the
   failure on the remode side.

   When the S-PE1 fails, T-PE1 would advertise the preferential status
   "Active" to S-PE2, On receiving the change of preferential status,
   S-PE2 SHOULD advertise the preferential status "Active" on both PW2-
   Seg2 and PW2-Seg3.  Then by matching the local and remote
   preferential forwarding status, PW2-Seg2 would be selected as primary
   PW segment, and traffic would be forwarded on MS-PW2.

4.  VCCV Considerations

   PW VCCV [RFC5085] CC type 1 "PW ACH" can be used with S-PE redundancy
   mechanism smoothly.  If VCCV CC type 3 "TTL Expiry" is to be used,
   the hop counts from T-PE1 to the remote T-PE needs be obtained in
   advance.  This can be achieved either by control plane SP-PE TLVs or
   through data plane tracing of the MS-PW.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document has the same security properties as in the PWE3 control
   protocol [RFC4447] and [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit].
