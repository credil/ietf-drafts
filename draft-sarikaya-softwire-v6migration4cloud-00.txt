      Dual Stack Lite and 4rd for Migrating Cloud Networks to IPv6
            draft-sarikaya-softwire-v6migration4cloud-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies how Dual Stack Lite or 4rd can be used to
   support IPv4 users in a cloud network that is IPv6 based.  The cloud
   network is IPv6 only which simplifies the network operation and
   management.  IPv4 users are supported either one of the transition
   technologies of DS-Lite or 4rd.  This protocol is ideal for new cloud
   deployments since no new public IPv4 addresses are needed.

Internet-Draft          DS Lite and 4rd for Cloud           October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Data center/cloud networks are being increasingly used by telecom
   operators as well as by enterprises.  Currently these networks are
   using IPv4 addressing.  However due to the depletion of public IPv4
   addresses this practice can not go on indefinitely.

   In this document we argue that data center/cloud network should use
   IPv6.  If IPv6 is used then it becomes an issue how to support IPv4
   users which we address in this document.  For this purpose dual stack
   lite [RFC6333] or 4rd [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd],
   [I-D.xli-behave-divi], [I-D.despres-softwire-4rd] can be used.

   Dual stack lite has two elements: Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4)
   element which receives privately addressed IPv4 packets from the
   users and encapsulates them in IPv6 and sends them to the Dual Stack
   Lite Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) element which is in
   charge of a central Network Address Translation (NAT) for the whole
   cloud network.  Packets received from public IPv4 network by AFTR are
   tunneled to the destination B4s after NAT operation in IPv6.  B4
   decapsulates the packet and delivers it to the user.

   4rd has two elements: Customer Edge (CE) device/router receives
   privately addressed IPv4 packets from the users and after a NAT
   operation sends them to the Border Relay (BR) either encapsulated
   using IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation or translated into IPv6.  BR
   decapsulates or translates the packet before sending to IPv4 network.
   The operation is stateless and the next packet from CE may be sent to
   another BR.

   In current data center deployments IPv4 is being used and
   [I-D.sakura-6rd-datacenter] describes how IPv6 service can be
   supported.  IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) [RFC5969] is used where 6rd
   CE is located at the servers and 6rd Border Relay is located at the
   backbone network.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC6333] and in
   [RFC6333] or 4rd [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd], [I-D.xli-behave-divi],
   [I-D.despres-softwire-4rd].


3.  Requirements

   This section states requirements on data center/cloud network IPv4
   and IPv6 support protocol.

   Data center/cloud network MUST support IPv6 natively due to the
   depletion of public IPv4 addresses.

   IPv4 support SHOULD enable direct routing among the geographically
   distributed data centers of the same network.

   IPv4 support SHOULD minimize the use of public IPv4 addresses.
   Network address translation (NAT) could be used on the customer side.


4.  Architecture

   Data center/cloud networks consists of thosands of servers in one
   center and usually an organization operates more than one data center
   each connected by a backbone IP network.  Each server runs multiple
   Virtual Machines (VM) each with its own IP address.  Data center
   could be Layer-2 based or Layer-3 based.

   Datacenter is Layer-3 based if packets are routed among the subnets,
   e.g. in between the racks and switched in a subnet, e.g. inside a
   rack.  Layer-3 based datacenter networks scale well for address
   resolution protocols like ARP but they make is difficult to move
   Virtual Machines as some sort of tunneling would be needed
   [I-D.wkumari-dcops-l3-vmmobility].

   Datacenter is Layer-2 based if packets are switched inside a rack and
   bridged among the racks, i.e. completely in Layer-2.  From IP point
   of view the nodes are connected to a single link.  Layer-2 based
   networks make it easy to move Virtual Machines from one server to
   another but on the other hand they don't scale well for address
   resolution protocols like ARP [I-D.narten-armd-problem-statement].

   In this document we assume L2-based datacenter/cloud network and
   design Dual Stack Lite protocol, see Figure 1 and 4rd, see Figure 2.

4.1.  DS-Lite Architecture

   Virtual Machines connect to the network using a virtual interface
   supported by the guest operating system.  These VMs are mapped to the
   physical servers in the rack.  In VM based data center/cloud networks
   B4 for VMs are placed in the guest OS using operating system patch
   similar to 6rd CE in [I-D.sakura-6rd-datacenter].

   Some data center/cloud networks do not employ Virtual Machines.
   These networks are server-based.  In server-based data center/cloud
   networks, B4 is placed in the access router.  In the storage area
   network B4 is also placed in the gateway router.

   AFTR is at the border of IPv6 backbone.  At B4s IPv4 packets are
   tunneled to AFTR and then AFTR decapsulates and performs the NAT
   operation and sends out IPv4 packet to the public internet, see
   Figure 1.

   In VM based data center/cloud networks Customer Edge router of 4rd
   for VMs are placed in the guest OS using operating system patch
   similar to 6rd CE in [I-D.sakura-6rd-datacenter].

   Some data center/cloud networks do not employ Virtual Machines.

   networks, CE is placed in the access router.  In the storage area

   CEs assign private IPv4 addresses to the virtual machines or users
   and perform NAT towards the backbone network.  On the outgoing
   interface, CEs may share public IPv4 addresses with port space
   sharing if there are not enough public IPv4 addresses to assign to
   the individual CEs.  Public IPv4 address sharing is optional, CEs may
   be configured with a unique IPv4 public address.

   4rd Border Relay is at the border of IPv6 backbone.  There could be
   more than one BRs and they all can have a single anycast address
   which CEs are configured with.  At CEs IPv4 packets are sent
   encapsulated with an IPv6 header.  In case of translation, IPv4
   packet is translated into an IPv6 packet [RFC6145] and then sent to
   BR, see Figure 2.

   At the BR, IPv6 packet is received.  In case of encapsulation, the
   packet is decapsulated and then sent to IPv4 network.  In case of
   translation, BR translates IPv6 packet into IPv4 packet [RFC6145] and
   then sends it to IPv4 network.

5.  DS-Lite Operation

   AFTR IPv6 address must be provisioned in B4 elements.  DHCPv6 can be
   used for this purpose.  B4 requests AFTR FQDN using the AFTR-Name
   DHCPv6 Option defined in [RFC6334].  B4 gets IPv6 address from the
   DNS using the AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option and configures IPv4-in-IPv6
   tunnel based on this address.

   B4 operates its own DHCPv4 server and hands out private IPv4
   addresses to the users.  It is the default IPv4 router and advertizes
   itself as the DNS server.  It should also be DNS proxy and serves
   IPv4 requests and sends the requests using IPv6 to the DNS servers.

   B4 encapsulates IPv4 packets and sends them to AFTR.  Fragmentation
   and reassembly of these packets are as discussed in Section 5.3 of

Internet-Draft          DS Lite and 4rd for Cloud           October 2011


   [RFC6333].

   Users in the same data center may communicate with others in the same
   center via certain applications like Skype.  Local routing of IPv4
   packets generated by such applications is needed at B4 to avoid a
   round trip to AFTR.

   AFTR receives IPv4 packets tunneled by B4s and decapsulates them.
   AFTR performs NAT operation on IPv4 before forwarding it to public
   IPv4 network.  NAT binding table is extended with IPv6 source
   address, i.e.  WAN side address of the B4 which sent this packet.

   For packets coming back from the Internet, AFTR does a reverse lookup
   in the extended IPv4 NAT binding table and extracts IPv6 destination
   address of the B4 and tunnels IPv4 packet to it.

5.1.  DS-Lite for Datacenter Considerations

   In DS-Lite B4 to B4 communication always goes through AFTR.  This
   could incur additional delays in datacenter/cloud networks because
   such traffic is expected to be high, e.g.  VMs/server may need
   constant communication with the storage area network which is also
   part of the same data center.

   IPv6 hardware support in current switches is poor compared with IPv4.
   Most commonly used switches reserve for IPv6 half of the memory
   reserved for IPv4 and thus they are slow in processing IPv6 packets.


6.  4rd Operation

   Instead of public IPv4 address sharing among the CEs of a data
   center, each CE is assigned a unique public IPv4 address.  This
   simplifies port usage when doing NAT operation.  IPv4 address is
   derived from domain IPv4 prefix which is used by the BRs to receive
   incoming traffic from IPv4 internet.

   CEs configure their WAN interface (IPv6 backbone) using regular means
   such as SLAAC, DHCPv6, etc. and get an IPv6 prefix assigned.  Each CE
   is configured with one or several mapping rules.  Each CE uses a
   reserved interface ID as part of its IPv6 source address to enable
   marking 4rd traffic and also to effectively create a 4rd interface on
   its WAN side.

   On the LAN side (VMs or users), CE is dual stack and supports IPv4 by
   assigning private IPv4 addresses.  When CE receives an IPv4 packet it
   performs NAT on the packet.  CE looks up the destination IPv4 address
   in the mapping rules.  If the prefix matches domain IPv4 prefix then

Internet-Draft          DS Lite and 4rd for Cloud           October 2011


   this packet sent to another CE.  CE derives an IPv6 destination
   address from IPv4 destination address.  Otherwise this packet is sent
   to BR.  CE derives a BR anycast address as destination IPv6 address.
   Next the packet is either encapsulated in IPv6 [RFC2473] or
   translated from IPv4 to IPv6 packet [RFC6145].

   BR receives IPv6 packet and checks to see if it is 4rd packet, either
   using the interface ID of the source IPv6 address or looking up the
   source IPv4 address in the mapping rules.  BR decapsulates or
   translates IPv6 packet and forwards resulting IPv4 packet using IPv4
   interface.

   For an incoming IPv4 packet BR checks if the destination IPv4 address
   has a match in the mapping rules.  Next, BR generates CE IPv6 address
   from IPv4 destination address.  BR either encapsulates IPv4 packet in
   IPv6 and or translates it into IPv6 and then sends it to CE.

   When CE receives an IPv6 packet it checks to see if IPv4 source
   address matches a mapping rule, i.e. the packet is coming from
   another CE or IPv6 source address matches BR IPv6 address, i.e. the
   packet is coming from BR.  CE decapsulates or translates the packet
   to obtain IPv4 packet and then forwards it on the LAN interface.

6.1.  4rd for Datacenter Considerations

   In 4rd CE to CE communication does not go through BR.  This is a
   significant advantage of 4rd over DS-Lite especially in data center
   networks.

   4rd CE and BR process each packet using 4rd mapping rules.  There
   could be over 1000 mapping rules.  This per packet processing
   naturally slows down users access to the internet especially at the
   CEs which are much less resourceful than BRs.
