Abstract

   This extension to IODEF (RFC 5070) is designed to aid in the sharing
   and dissemination of digital forensics information.  The goal is to
   allow a tool independent format to share information between
   organizations focused on digital forensics: drive images, file
   carving, metadata, and related hashes.  As with IODEF and its
   extensions, it is defined using XML.

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

INTERNET DRAFT   Digital Forensics Extension for IODEF February 19, 2012


1  Introduction

   This extension to IODEF is designed to carry digital forensics
   information in a way acceptable for chain of evidence handling and
   general forensics examination.  There are various programs that
   generate forensics information, but few that generate that
   information in a way that is exchangeable in a universal way.

   There have been some efforts to create independent standards, often
   XML based, to exchange digital forensics information.  Indeed, this
   standard is designed to incorporate features from those efforts,
   DFXML, DEXF, IOC, and DFRWS.  By extending IODEF, however, the goal
   of this standard is to build upon a widely used IETF standard, take
   advantage of the other features within the IODEF family of standards.

   The main pieces of information this extension seeks to be able to
   convey are information about file systems and the resulting products
   from analyzing file systems.  This includes information about file
   carving, system metadata including disk metadata.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Forensic Extension to IODEF

   The Forensics Data is captured within a new class within IODEF's
   Event Data class, within its Additional Data class.  The Forensics
   Data is not required to be present, and may occur an unlimited number
   of times as needed.

3  Security Considerations

   This standard is an extension to IODEF [IODEF] and as such, the
   security considerations that apply to IODEF apply to this extension.

   In addition, the security provided by the related RID [RID]
   enhancements apply equally to this extensions as to IODEF [IODEF].
