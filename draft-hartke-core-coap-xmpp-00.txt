Internet-Draft        CoAP REST API for XMPP PubSub         January 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a REST API that enables Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap] clients to interact with
   Extensible Messaging Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120] Publish-Subscribe
   [XEP-0060] services.  The task of creating, retrieving, updating and
   deleting pubsub items and nodes is delegated to a CoAP/XMPP proxy.

   Publish-Subscribe enables XMPP entities to create nodes at a pubsub
   service and publish information at those nodes; an event notification
   (with or without payload) is then broadcasted to all entities that
   have subscribed to the node.  Nodes and published information can be
   identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986] using the
   'xmpp.pubsub' URI scheme [XEP-xxxx].

   The REST API defined in this document consists of the following
   elements:

   o  the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap]
      [I-D.ietf-core-observe];

   o  the 'xmpp.pubsub' URI scheme [XEP-xxxx];

   o  the representation formats described in this document; and

   o  the link relation types defined in [RFC5988] and in this document.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the terms and
   concepts of [REST], [I-D.ietf-core-coap] and [XEP-0060].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Protocol and Scheme

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) allows clients to specify
   an arbitrary absolute URI in requests to CoAP proxies.  This section
   defines what it means to perform a CoAP request on an 'xmpp.pubsub'
   URI, i.e. an URI that identifies a node in the context of a pubsub
   service or an item in the scope of such a node.

   If a CoAP request contains a Proxy-URI Option with an 'xmpp.pubsub'
   URI, then the receiving CoAP end-point (called "the proxy"
   henceforth) is requested to perform the operation specified by the
   request method on the indicated pubsub node or item and return the
   result of the operation to the client.

Internet-Draft        CoAP REST API for XMPP PubSub         January 2012


   How the proxy actually satisfies the request is an implementation
   detail, although the typical case is expected to be the proxy
   reconstructing the encapsulated XMPP address from the URI, connecting
   to an appropriate XMPP server, and sending an appropriate XMPP
   "stanza" (XML fragment) to the XMPP address.  Some implementation
   considerations for this case are outlined in Section 6.

2.1.  Node URI

   For a URI of the form xmpp.pubsub:[//
   authority/][localpart@]domainpart/[nodeid/], the following methods
   have the following meaning:

   GET     The GET method requests the proxy to return a current
           representation of the pubsub node identified by the request
           URI.

   POST    The POST method requests the proxy to publish the enclosed
           representation as new pubsub item to the pubsub node
           identified by the request URI.

   DELETE  The DELETE method requests the proxy to delete the pubsub
           node identified by the request URI, including all published
           items within the scope of the node.

2.2.  Node Meta-Data URI

   For a URI of the form xmpp.pubsub:[//
   authority/][localpart@]domainpart/[nodeid/]?meta-data, the following
   methods have the following meaning:

   GET     The GET method requests the proxy to return a current
           representation of the node meta-data identified by the
           request URI.

2.3.  Item URI

   For a URI of the form xmpp.pubsub:[//
   authority/][localpart@]domainpart/nodeid/itemid, the following
   methods have the following meaning:

   GET     The GET method requests the proxy to return a current
           representation of the pubsub item identified by the request
           URI.

Internet-Draft        CoAP REST API for XMPP PubSub         January 2012


   PUT     The PUT method requests the proxy to update or create the
           pubsub item identified by the request URI with the enclosed
           representation.

   DELETE  The DELETE method requests the proxy to delete the pubsub
           item identified by the request URI.


3.  Link Relation Types

   This specification adds the following values to the Link Relation
   Type registry of [RFC5988]:

   create  Indicates that the link's context is a collection of
           resources, and refers to a resource that can be used to
           create new resources within the link's context.

   update  Refers to a resource that can be used to update the link's
           context.

   delete  Refers to a resource that can be used to delete the link's
           context.

   item    Refers to a resource in a collection of resources.

   meta    Refers to a resource containing meta-data for the link's
           context.


4.  Media Type Definitions

4.1.  Node Representation

   A node is represented in the CoRE Link Format
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].

   The representation SHOULD include, but is not restricted to, the
   following links:

   o  A link with a relation of "create", if the node supports item
      publication.

   o  A link with a relation of "delete", if the node can be deleted.

   o  A link with a relation of "meta", if the node has meta-data.

   o  A link with a relation of "last", if the node is a leaf node and
      has at least one published item.

Internet-Draft        CoAP REST API for XMPP PubSub         January 2012


   o  A link with a relation of "item" for each published item, if the
      node is a leaf node.

   o  A link with a relation of "related" for each child node, if the
      node is a collection node (see [XEP-0163]).

   Figure 1 shows the representation of an example root node with URI
   <xmpp.pubsub:pubsub.shakespeare.lit/>.  The representation includes
   links to all first-level nodes of the pubsub service.

   <blogs/>; rel="related"; title="Weblog updates",
   <news/>; rel="related"; title="News and announcements"

                  Figure 1: Representation of a root node

   Figure 2 shows the representation of an example collection node with
   URI <xmpp.pubsub:pubsub.shakespeare.lit/blogs/>.  The representation
   includes links to second-level nodes.

   <../princely_musings/>; rel="related",
   <../kingly_ravings/>; rel="related",
   <../starcrossed_stories/>; rel="related",
   <../moorish_meanderings/>; rel="related"

               Figure 2: Representation of a collection node

   Figure 3 shows the representation of an example leaf node with URI
   <xmpp.pubsub:pubsub.shakespeare.lit/princely_musings/>.  The
   representation consists of a link to a resource containing the node's
   meta-data, a link to a resource containing the last item published to
   the node, a link to a resource that can be used to publish new items,
   a link to a resource that can be used to delete the node, and four
   links to resources containing published items in the context of the
   node.

   <?meta-data>; rel="meta",
   <?last-item>; rel="last",
   <>; rel="create",
   <>; rel="delete",
   <368866411b877c30064a5f62b917cffe>; rel="item",

   <4e30f35051b7b8b42abe083742187228>; rel="item",
   <ae890ac52d0df67ed7cfdf51b644e901>; rel="item"

4.2.  Meta-Data Representation

   Node meta-data is represented in Turtle [W3C.SUBM-turtle-20110328].

   The representation makes statements about a pubsub node using a set
   predicates derived from the "pubsub#meta-data" FORM_TYPE defined in
   [XEP-0060].  The predicates are obtained by prefixing each form field
   name with the string "http://jabber.org/protocol/".  For example, the
   predicate that indicates the name of a node (form field "pubsub#
   title") is "http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#title".

   Figure 4 shows the representation of example meta-data for the node
   identified by the URI <xmpp.pubsub:pubsub.shakespeare.lit/
   princely_musings/>.

   @prefix p: <http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#> .

   <xmpp.pubsub:pubsub.shakespeare.lit/princely_musings/>
      p:type            "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";

      p:language        "en";
      p:contact         <xmpp:bard@shakespeare.lit>;
      p:owner           <xmpp:hamlet@denmark.lit>;

                        <xmpp:horatio@shakespeare.lit>;
      p:num_subscribers 1066 .

             Figure 4: Representation of meta-data for a node

4.3.  Item Representation

   A pubsub item is represented in an XML-based document format
   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] with the following properties:

   o  The document MUST be well-formed.

   o  This specification does not define a DTD, and hence does not
      require the document to be valid (in the sense used by XML).

   o  For compatibility with XMPP, the document MUST meet the restricted
      form of XML defined in Section 11.1 of [RFC6120] (i.e., comments,
      processing instructions, DTD subsets and entity references other
      than the predefined ones are prohibited).

Internet-Draft        CoAP REST API for XMPP PubSub         January 2012


   o  The pubsub item is the XML fragment consisting of the document's
      root element and its content, if any.

   An example follows.

   <?xml version='1.0'?>
   <entry xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'>
     <title>Soliloquy</title>
     <summary>
        To be, or not to be: that is the question:
        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
        And by opposing end them?
     </summary>
