<abstract>
<t>
<xref target="RFC3551"/> defines the AVP RTP profile, which is the basis for
 many other profiles, such as <xref target="RFC3711">SAVP</xref>,
 <xref target="RFC4585">AVPF</xref>, and <xref target="RFC5124">SAVPF</xref>.
This document updates <xref target="RFC3551"/> (and by extension, the profiles
 that build upon it) to reflect changes in audio codec usage since the document
 was originally published.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
<xref target="RFC3551"/> says that audio applications operating under the AVP
 profile SHOULD be able to send and receive PCMU and DVI4.
However, in practice, many RTP deployments do not support DVI4, and its utility
 is limited in the presence of much more modern codecs.
This document updates the recommended audio codec selection for the AVP
 profile to remove the SHOULD for DVI4.
