1.  Introduction

   The CLUE WG is chartered to design a protocol working in conjunction
   with the IETFOs protocol suites of choiceNnamely SIP for basic call
   setup and control and RTP for media transport.  This document
   describes options for the coding and transport of CLUE messages in a
   SIP / RTP environment.  Specifically, three issues are addressed.

   First, while the framework draft conceptually describes message
   flows, it does not specify how those messages are actually
   transferred Oon the wireO and how they relate to the SIP offer/answer
   [rfc3264].  This document lists the options that have been proposed
   in CLUE to date, plus some new ones derived by the authors.

   Second, the framework-01 draft describes three messages between the
   producer and the consumer in an abstract form, without specifying the
   details of the representation of those messages.  This memo lists
   (some of) the options for the OcodingO of the abstract messages of
   the framework draft.

   Third, before any CLUE messages can be meaningfully exchanged, it is
   necessary to discover whether the involved systems are actually CLUE-
   capable.

   In version -00 of this document we deliberately list all options we
   could come up with, however likely they may be to find consensus in
   the group.  Deciding on the appropriate mechanism (or mechanismsN it
   is not always appropriate to have a single solution for a given
   problem, though this is of course desirable from an interoperability
   viewpoint) is left as an exercise for later.  That does not mean that
   the authors do not have preferences, and/or specific knowledge of
   certain mechanisms, and would go in greater depth in describing one
   mechanism while being superficial in describing another.

   The message ladder diagram will be added once we decide on the
   transport of the CLUE messages


2.  Assumptions

   The Basic Clue data model is specified in the framework document.
   The framework defines three messages that carry the Clue data:

   Provider Capabilities Announcement

   Consumer Capability Message

   Consumer Configure Request

   CLUE messages may need to be sent at the initialization of a call,
   and possibly in irregular intervals which are spaced apart in the
   order of seconds, minutes or even longer.

   There is no hard real-time transmission requirement for CLUE
   messages; latencies in the seconds range are acceptable.

   The Clue message handshake is different from the offer/answer
   exchange [rfc3264], primarily because the CLUE exchange is uni-
   directional, requiring a similar exchange for each side of the media
   flow, while one offer/answer exchange defines both sides of the media
   flow.

   There is no hard requirement for synchronization of CLUE messages,
   though there may be a need for sequencing, (TBD).

   CLUE messages may need to describe the characteristics of all
   endpoints in a conference (TBD), and that conference can potentially
   include dozens of endpoints.

   There will be an SDP offer/answer exchange as part of the solution.
   The offer/answer will be used to establish the media channels and
   negotiate SDP parameters as well as to allow interoperability with
   systems that do not support the CLUE protocol.  The CLUE data will
   try to not duplicate SDP attributes.


3.  Transport for CLUE messages

   CLUE messages need to be conveyed from one CLUE capable system to
   another.  This conveyance is called OtransportO of CLUE messages.  It
   should be clear that the message transport can be based on a
   transport layer (layer 4 in ISO/OSI) protocol or other layers, such
   as the application layer.

   In contrast to the Ocontent representationO, the transport of CLUE
   messages is somewhat more tightly bound to the environment.  In some
   scenarios it may be possible to reuse most of the mechanisms defined
   in an option for transport between SIP and H.323, while in others
   this is not possible.

   The selection of the transport may have some affect on the content
   representation.(Need to write more about the specifications that need
   to be written, ie.  SIP-INFO package, RTP payload format, etc.)

3.1.  Option 1 : Piggy-pack on SIP

   SIP includes a number of methods that can carry (directly or through
   content indirection) CLUE messages.  Many of these messages can be
   exchanged during the lifetime of a session without having adverse
   side effects such as complete codec initialization (what happens
   today in many products when using re-invite).  Piggy-packing CLUE
   messages on SIP has the advantage that any built-in transport and
   reliability mechanisms of SIP can be re-used.  It also has the
   feature (advantage?) that CLUE signaling is being conveyed in the
   signaling plane rather than in the media plane (making things such as
   decomposition potentially easier and certainly more intuitive).

   One option that was mentioned before was to define a new INFO package
   [RFC 6086].  When looking at using SIP signaling there are other
   options like subscribe/ notify or Message method, see RFC 6086
   section 8.4.1.  Note that subscribe creates a separate dialog usage
   and is normally sent outside of existing dialog.  We can also use the
   UPDATE method [RFC3311].  There were concerns about using re-invite
   claiming that it takes too long since that commonly used codec boxes
   teardown every existing media session during re-invites.  RFC 3311
   says that although UPDATE can be used on confirmed dialogs, it is
   RECOMMENDED that a re-INVITE be used instead.  This is because an
   UPDATE needs to be answered immediately, ruling out the possibility
   of user approval.  Such approval will frequently be needed, and is
   possible with a re-INVITE.  The thinking so far was that if we want
   to encode the CLUE data not as SDP we may be better to use INFO.

3.2.  Option 2: CLUE control channel on the media plane over UDP

   During the initial SIP handshake, a CLUE channel is established (if
   both systems are CLUE capable).  Over this channel, secure UDP
   packets are exchanged in a reliable fashion, for example, by a CLUE
   defined protocol that can have a reliable handshake based on similar
   mechanisms in BFCP over UDP.  Standard ICE can be used to deal with
   firewalls and NATs.  Issues here are congestion control and the
   architectural issue that signaling information is conveyed in the
   media plane (which may or may not be anything beyond an aesthetic
   problem).

3.3.  Option 3: CLUE control channel on the media plane over TCP

   This option is similar to the use of CLUE on the media plane, but
   uses TCP as the transport protocol.  TCP takes care of reliability
   issues as well as congestion control.  However, the NAT/firewall
   traversal may be a major issue, as ICE-TCP has not seen any
   deployment in the video conferencing industry.  In addition, keep-
   alive messages may present a problem for sessions with thousands of

   attendees, which is possible under some deployment scenarios.

3.4.  Option 4: CLUE control channel over UDP and RTP

   This option is similar to option 2, except that the mechanisms of RTP
   can be used to make the transmission sufficiently reliable (through
   re-transmission or FEC extensions of RTP).

3.5.  Option 5: FTP

   CLUE messages could conceivably be placed into files, which could be
   polled at regular intervals (or through a simple message) using ftp.
   A bit archaic and has security and NAT/filewall issues.  We mention
   this option for completemess only, and because it was used in at
   least one legacy telepresence system.  In the authorsO opinions, itOs
   probably not a viable choice.

3.6.  Option 6: HTTP

   The authors have not studied this option, and suggest to remove it in
   the -01 option of this document unless people find it viable (and
   come up with text).  HTTP transport over port 80 is increasingly used
   to get through NAT/firewall blockages, and this mechanism may be
   required if technologies such as RTCWEB begin to be used in
   videoconferencing and telepresence.  Questions include, dach box has
   a web server?  Would there need to be a central web server for CLUE
   control at service provider?


4.  Content Representation

   The data model in the framework-01 draft does not have a specific
   representation of the data.  Many different representation
   OlanguagesO, for example XML, possibly SDP, ASN.1, and others can be
   used, and we need to decide on one.  The decision may be based on the
   selected transport, but not necessarily.

   One key observation that has to be made at this point (described in
   greater detail above) is that the framework-01 draftOs message
   exchange system appears to make it impossible to directly add the
   CLUE exchange to the offer/answer mechanism SIP videoconferencing
   endpoints use today.  It is, therefore, not a hard requirement to use
   SDP for the representation of the CLUE messages.  We have a freedom
   of choice here, which is why this section exists.

   Another observation is that the IETF is not the only body who
   standardizes telepresence systems; the ITU-T is also working in this
   field.  While it probably shouldnOt be a hard requirement for an IETF

   document to allow for seamless interoperability with the H.323
   standards suite, it appears to be desirable if it can be easily done.

   It is very well possible that even moderately complex CLUE messages
   may exceed MTU sizes commonly found in todayOs Internet.  There has
   been discussion in CLUE of sessions with thousands of participants.
   Even if a CLUE message can be compressed into a few bytes for each
   endpoint, such sessions can easily violate the commonly found
   Ethernet 1492-byte MTU Accordingly, message transport protocols will
   have to be prepared to split CLUE messages into fragments, which has
   implications on the design complexity of those protocols.  This
   problem is especially an issue for verbose representations, such as
   XML.

4.1.  Option 1 : SDP

   SDP and its various extensions are used in SIP based systems for the
   offer/answer exchange, and, therefore, those systems include SDP
   parsers that could probably be extended to support CLUE messages.
   SDP is also a fairly compact, but still (though barely) human
   readable content representation language.  Against SDP speaks mostly
   that SDP was never designed to describe anything as complex as the
   CLUE data.

4.2.  Option 2 : XML

   XML is very flexible, and the representation of choice for many IETF
   technologies not bound to a certain legacy.  It certainly allows for
   all flexibility needed to represent all CLUE messages currently
   considered.  It also is naturally extensible in a way SDP is not.  On
   the downside, XML is fairly verbose, which has implications on the
   transport.

4.3.  Option 3 : ASN.1

   ASN.1 is similarly flexible and extensible as XML, and (in its binary
   representation) fairly compact.  While it is commonly used in H.323,
   and while the video conferencing industry certainly has access to the
   tools necessary to deploy ASN.1 (a major obstacle in other
   industries), it is not widely used by SIP implementations.

4.4.  Option 4 : Clue Defined Format

   It is, of course, possible that the CLUE WG defines its own format,
   possibly compact, possibly binary and possibly extensible
   representation language or format for CLUE messages.

4.5.  Examples

   An example or examples should be added here when possible


5.  Clue Discovery

   This section summarizes ways to discover whether systems involved are
   CLUE-capable.  For simplicity, point-to-point scenarios are assumed.
   Multipoint scenarios can potentially make discovery considerably more
   complex.

   Discovery appears to be necessarily bound to the capability exchange
   of the involved systems.

5.1.  Option 1 : CLUE discovery as a side effect of opening a CLUE
      control channel

   If, for the transport of CLUE messages, a media plane control channel
   were used (option 2,3,4 of the transport options), then the discovery
   of CLUE capability would be a side effect of the opening of this
   control channel during the initial offer/answer exchange.

5.2.  Option 2 : SIP Message Transport

   If we use the INFO message then by using the Recv-Info header field
   the support for the CLUE package can be signalled.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


7.  Security Considerations

   Any method for bypassing NAT/Firewall protections of course brings
   security issues, which need to be dealt with.
