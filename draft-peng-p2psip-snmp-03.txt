Internet-Draft          An SNMP Usage for RELOAD            October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines an SNMP Usage for REsource LOcation And
   Discovery (RELOAD),which can be used to manage the RELOAD network.
   It can provide important network management functions, such as
   adjusting the network configuration, monitoring the performance of
   the network, collecting real-time failure information, etc.  These
   network management functions are essential for stable operation and
   high-quality services of the network.  As traditional network
   management protocols (e.g., SNMP) cannot be directly applied to
   RELOAD network management, it is necessary to introduce new RELOAD
   usage of SNMP.

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base], there are two kinds of nodes in
   RELOAD network: centralized servers, such as the Enrollment Server;
   distributed nodes, such as Peer and Client.  The management function
   of centralized servers can be carried out by traditional management
   methods, so we don't discuss the management of the centralized server
   in this document, and only focus on the management of the distributed
   nodes.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   We use the terminology and definitions from Concepts and Terminology
   for Peer to Peer SIP [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] and the RELOAD Base
   Protocol [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] and SNMPv3 [RFC3411] and TLS TM for
   SNMP [RFC5953] extensively in this document.

   SNMP:     Simple Network Management Protocol.

   Entity:     SNMP Entity, including both Manager and Agent, which
   resides in RELOAD Node.

   Manager:     SNMP Manager, which resides in RELOAD Node.

   Agent:     SNMP Agent, which resides in RELOAD Node.

   Node:     RELOAD Node, including both Peer and Client, which SNMP
   manager or agent resides in.

   M-Node:     Management Node, which is the RELOAD Node which SNMP
   Manager resides in.

   O-Node:     Objective Node, which is the RELOAD Node managed by a
   network manager, which SNMP agent resides in.

   R-Node:     Responsibility Node, which is the RELOAD Node responsible
   for storing the data according to P2P algorithm.


3.  Network Management Requirements

   SNMP usage SHOULD or MAY provide these functions and mechanisms as
   below:

   1.  SNMP usage for RELOAD SHOULD provide the management functions for
   RELOAD Nodes.  Such as setting node name, software version or other
   configuration information, monitoring the number of the messages
   initiated, forwarded or processed by nodes, reporting program failure
   , message forwarding failure or other error on nodes.

   2.  SNMP usage for RELOAD SHOULD provide the management functions for
   RELOAD resource.  Such as tracing forwarded the RELOAD messages,
   processing flows of resources.

   3.  SNMP usage for RELOAD SHOULD provide mechanisms for SNMP entities
   to discover each other based on RELOAD NodeID.

   4.  SNMP usage for RELOAD SHOULD provide mechanisms for SNMP entities
   to establish a secure connection between each other.

   5.  SNMP usage for RELOAD SHOULD provide mechanisms for SNMP manager
   to discover the RELOAD NodeID associated to a given ResourceID.

   6.  SNMP usage for RELOAD SHOULD provide mechanisms for SNMP entities
   to traverse the NAT in front of the SNMP entities which they will
   connect to.

   7.  SNMP usage for RELOAD MAY provide mechanisms for SNMP entities to
   discover the SNMP manager based on manager names or functions.


4.  Basic Operations and SNMP

   The management interactions between nodes can be abstracted into a
   few basic operations: 1). the network manager requests data of nodes
   and resources; 2). the network manager sets data of nodes and
   resources; 3). nodes initiate data reports to the network manager.  A
   variety of management functions can be carried out by these basic
   operations or their combinations.  This document adopts SNMP as a
   RELOAD Usage to achieve the management of the RELOAD network.  The

Internet-Draft          An SNMP Usage for RELOAD            October 2011


   basic operations described above can be implemented by messages
   defined in SNMP, such as GetRequest, GetNextRequest, GetBulkRequest,
   Response, SetRequest, Trap, InformRequest.


5.  Overview of SNMP Usage

   The SNMP entity is deployed as an application on RELOAD Nodes in the
   SNMP usage for RELOAD.  In other words, each SNMP entity is
   associated with a RELOAD Node.  SNMP entities discover other entities
   (agents or managers) by RELOAD mechanisms and to set up connects with
   other SNMP entities.  Therefore, SNMP entities talk to each other
   using SNMP protocol on dedicated connections, while RELOAD protocols
   are used for Node discovery and connection setup.  The diagram of
   system composition and protocol is as follow:

   This document defines SNMP Usage Architeture, which includes SNMP-
   RELOAD application and SNMP applications in the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP) architecture defined in [RFC3411].  The
   SNMP-RELOAD Application will provide the functions related to RELOAD,
   such as getting available address for Node ID and getting Node ID for
   Resource ID, to SNMP applications to implement the management for
   RELOAD network.  This document identifies and describes some key
   aspects that need to be considered for SNMP usage for RELOAD.  The

8.  Network Manager Registering and Looking up

   The Node ID of the network manager which acts as a provider of
   management service should be able to be found by agents on RELOAD
   nodes, thus agents can send messages to the manager.  The Node ID of
   network manager may not be fixed or predefined in advance.  So a
   recognizable name is necessary and the managed nodes should find the
   Node ID of the manager through this fixed name.  Therefore, it is
   necessary for the manager to register itself in the network after
   joining the network.  In other words, the manager needs to store the
   mapping between its name and its Node ID in the RELOAD network.  When
   an agent wants to contact the manager, it needs to first look up the
   manager's Node ID corresponding to the predefined management service
   name.  This registration is achieved by storing the name of the
   network manager and the structure of SnmpRegistration into the RELOAD
   network.  The corresponding SNMP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID will be
   formally defined in the following chapter.  It is proposed to store

   the mapping of the manager's name to a destination list in this
   document.  Therefore, a single Node ID as a special case for a
   destination list.  The contents of a SnmpRegistration structure are
   as follows

   struct {

      opaque        contact_prefs<0..2^16-1>;

      Destination        destination_list<0..2^16-1>;

   } SnmpRegistrationData;

   struct {

      uint16        length;

      SnmpRegistrationData        data;

   } SnmpRegistration;

   The contents of the SnmpRegistration PDU are:

   length

      the length of the rest of the PDU

   data

      the contents of the registration data is an opaque string
   containing the network manager's contact preferences and a
   destination list for the peer.

   When an agent needs to contact to a network manager, it must perform
   a query of SnmpRegistration by FetchReq message to get the manager's
   Node ID.

   The process diagram for Network Manager Registering and Looking up is
   as follow:

9.  An SNMP Entity Forms a Direct Connection with Another SNMP Entity

   Because the targets of the management tasks and reports of RELOAD
   network are Node ID of RELOAD or snmeEngineID of SNMP.  (Note: In
   this document, snmeEngineID constructed from Node ID.)  So when a
   SNMP Entity needs to send SNMP messages to another SNMP Entity, it
   must get the other side of available IP address firstly.  Due to the
   existence of NAT, they need to exchange ICE addresses each other and
   checks connectivity, then selects a pair of available IP address to

   establish connection.  (Of course, if a connection has been
   established between this pair of IP address, the initiator node will
   directly send messages to the target node.)  The process of Forming a

10.  O-Node information Collection

   Before a network manager performs management tasks for nodes, it must
   first collect the Node ID and its status information of managed
   nodes.  The way of a manager collecting the information of RELOAD
   nodes (including Peer and Client) is as follows: when an agent starts
   up, its associated RELOAD Node joins the RELOAD network, it needs to
   get the name of a network manager from its configuration or an
   Enrollment Server; then this node connects to the network manager and
   registers its own information, such as node name, Node ID, status,
   etc., to the manager.  The procedure of finding the manager and
   connecting to it has been introduced in the previous section.  There
   are many other ways to collect information of managed nodes, which
   could be studied in future documents.


11.  Network Manger Looks up the O-Node for a Resource

   When a network manager needs to send a management task for resource,
   it is necessary that the network manager first gets the Node ID of
   the O-Node responsible for the resource so as to judge whether there
   is a connection with the O-Node.  One way for the manager to get the
   Node ID of the O-Node responsible for the resource is to acquire the
   Node ID of the O-NODE responsible for the target resource through
   via_list of Forwarding Header in FindAns.  The process is as follows:

   Firstly, the network manager sends an FindReq to the RELOAD network,
   the target Reource ID is put into the destination_list of the

Internet-Draft          An SNMP Usage for RELOAD            October 2011


   FindReq.  Then the RELOAD network routes FindReq to the node
   responsible for the target Resource ID according to its routing
   algorithm.

   Secondly, the O-Node returns FindAns to the network manager through
   the RELOAD network.  The first Node ID in the via_list of the
   Forwarding Header of the FindAns is the Node ID of the O-Node
   responsible for the target resource.

   The process diagram for Network Manger Looking up the O-Node for a
   Resource is as below:

   After the network manager gets the Node ID of O-Node, it will be able
   to judge whether there is a connection between itself and the O-Node.
   If the connection exists, the network manager may directly send SNMP

   message to the O-Node, otherwise it is necessary to establish a new
   connection to the O-Node.


12.  SNMP-REGISTRATION Kind Definition

   This section defines the SNMP-REGISTRATION kind.

   Name     SNMP-REGISTRATION

   Kind ID     The Resource Name for the SNMP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is
   the Name of the network manager.  The data stored is a
   SnmpRegistrationData, which can contain a destination list and
   contact preferences to the peer which is acting for the network
   manager.

   Data Model     The data model for the SNMP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is
   single value.

   Access Control     USER-NODE-MATCH.

   Data stored under the SNMP-REGISTRATION kind is of type
   SnmpRegistration.  A destination list can be used to reach the
   network manager.


13.  Security Considerations

   There are three solutions to the security problem in SNMP Usage for
   RELOAD.  The first option is shared key based solution, which is
   SNMPv3 security solution (USM).  The second option is PKI based
   security solution, which is to use the certificate of RELOAD to
   authenticate and encrypt the SNMP messages.  The third option is
   (D)TLS based security solution, which uses the secure (D)TLS links to
   transfer the SNMP message.

   USM was designed to be independent of other existing security
   infrastructures.  USM therefore uses a separate principal and key
   management infrastructure.  Operators have reported that deploying
   another principal and key management infrastructure in order to use
   SNMPv3 is a deterrent to deploying SNMPv3.  [RFC5590] And the
   efficiency of the second option is questionable.  So we recommend the
   third option.

   The special detail of (D)TLS based security for SNMP is defined in
   RFC5953, and it won't be described again in this document.  In short,
