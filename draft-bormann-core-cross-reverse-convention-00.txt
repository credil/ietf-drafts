       A convention for URIs operating a HTTP-CoAP reverse proxy
             draft-bormann-core-cross-reverse-convention-00

Abstract

   CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and
   networks.  In many applications, CoAP will be used via cross-protocol
   proxies from HTTP clients.  HTTP client libraries may make it hard to
   operate an HTTP-CoAP forward proxy by not providing a way to put a
   CoAP URI on the HTTP Request-Line; reverse-proxying may therefore
   lead to wider applicability of a proxy.  This specification will
   define a convention for URIs operating such a HTTP-CoAP reverse
   proxy.

   The current version of this specification is a placeholder only.  It
   is meant to pick up
   http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/ticket/259 and provide a home
   for its considerations.  It might be merged with other documents
   later.

1.  Introduction

   (see abstract for now)

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, BCP 14
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant CoAP
   implementations.

   In this document, the term "byte" is used in its now customary sense
   as a synonym for "octet".

   Where bit arithmetic is explained, this document uses the notation
   familiar from the programming language C, except that the operator
   "**" stands for exponentiation.
