           Requirements for Marking SIP Messages to be Logged
                   draft-dawes-dispatch-logme-reqs-01

Abstract

   SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user
   reported problem and for regression testing if network or client
   software is upgraded.  As networks grow and become interconnected,
   including connection via transit networks, it becomes impractical to
   predict the path that SIP signalling will take between clients, and
   therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling end-to-end.

   This draft describes requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP
   protocol which can be used to mark signalling as subject to logging.
   Such marking will typically be applied as part of network testing
   controlled by the network operator and not used in regular client
   signalling.  However, such marking can be carried end-to-end
   including the SIP terminals, even if a session originates and
   terminates in different networks.

1.  Introduction

   If users experience problems with setting up sessions using SIP,
   their service provider needs to find out why by examining the SIP
   signalling.  Also, if network or client software or hardware is
   upgraded regression testing is needed.  Such diagnostics apply to a
   small proportion of network traffic and can apply end-to-end, even if
   signalling crosses several networks possibly belonging to several
   different network operators.  It may not be possible to predict the
   path through those networks in advance, therefore a mechanism is
   needed to mark a session as being of interest to enable SIP entities
   along the signalling path to provide diagnostic logging.  This draft
   describes the requirements for such a 'log me' marker for SIP
   signalling.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Motivating Scenario

   Signalling for SIP session setup can cross several networks, and
   these networks may not have common ownership and also may be in
   differrent countries.  If a single operator wishes to perform
   regression testing or fault diagnosis end-to-end, the separate
   ownership of networks that carry the signalling and the explosion in
   the number of possible signalling paths through SIP entities from the
   originating to the terminating user make it impractical to pre-
   configure logging of an end-to-end SIP signalling of a session of
   interest.

   The figure below shows an example of a signalling path through
   multiple networks.

4.  Skeleton Diagnostic Procedure

   The skeleton diagnostic procedure is as follows:

   o  The user's terminal is placed in debug mode.  The terminal logs
      its own signalling and inserts a log me marker into SIP requests
      for session setup

   o  All SIP entities that the signalling traverses, from the first
      proxy the terminal connects to at the edge of the network to the

      destination client terminal, can detect that the log me marker is
      present and can log SIP requests and responses that contain the
      marker if configured to do so.

   o  Subsequent responses and requests in the same dialog are logged.

   o  Logging stops, either because the dialog has ended or because a
      'stop event', typically expiry of a certain amount of time,
      occurred

   o  The user's terminal and any other SIP entity that has logged
      signalling sends logs to a server that is co-ordinating
      diagnostics.


5.  Requirements for a Log Me Marker

   o  REQ1: It shall be possible to mark a SIP request or response as of
      interest for logging by inserting a log me marker.  This is known
      as log-me marking.

   o  REQ2: It shall be possible for a log-me marker to cross network
      boundaries.

   o  REQ3: A log-me marker is most effective if it passes end-to-end.
      However, source networks should behave responsibly and not leave
      it to a downstream network to detect and remove a marker that it
      will not use.  A log-me marker should be removed at trust domain
      boundaries.

   o  REQ4: SIP entities should log SIP requests or responses with a
      log-me marker.

   o  REQ5: If a UA receives a request with a log-me marker, it shall
      echo that log-me marker in responses to that request.

   o  REQ6: A SIP proxy may perform log-me marking of requests and
      responses.  Typical cases where a proxy needs to perform log-me
      marking are when a UA has not marked a request and when responses
      received on a dialog of interest for logging do not contain a
      log-me marker.  In these cases, the entity that performs log-me
      marking is stateful inasmuch as it must remember when a dialog is
      of interest for logging.

   o  REQ7: For SIP proxies, logging of SIP requests that contain a
      log-me marker may be stateless.  For example, it is not required
      for a SIP entity to maintain state of which SIP requests contained
      a log-me marker in order to log responses to those requests.

Internet-Draft                log me marker                 January 2013


      Echoing a log-me marker in responses is the responsibility of the
      UA that receives a request.

   o  REQ8: A log-me marker may include an identifier that indicates the
      test case that caused it to be inserted, known as a test case
      identifier.  The test case identifier does not have any impact on
      session setup, it is used by the diagnostic server to collate all
      logged SIP requests and responses to the initial SIP request in a
      dialog or standalone transaction.  The Session-ID described in
      I-D.ietf-insipid-session-id-reqts
      [I-D.ietf-insipid-session-id-reqts] could be used as the test case
      identifier but it would be useful for the UA to log a human
      readable name together with this Session-ID when it performs log
      me marking of an initial SIP request.

   o  REQ9: A log-me marker may include a locator of the server that
      collects logs.  This locator is known as the diagnostic server
      identifier and may be an address of a server.  A SIP entity can
      use the diagnostic server identifier to send collected logs to the
      diagnostic server.


6.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.

6.1.  Trust Domain

   Since a log me marker may cause a SIP entity to log the SIP header
   and body of a request or response, the log me marker should be
   removed at a trust domain boundary.  If a prior agreement to log
   sessions exists with the net hop network then the log me marker might
   not be removed.

6.2.  Security Threats

   The log me marker is not sensitive information, although it will
   sometimes be inserted because a particular device is experiencing
   problems.

   The presence of a log me marker will cause some SIP entities to log
   signalling.  Therefore, this marker must be removed at the earliest
   opportunity if it has been incorrectly inserted.

   Activating a debug mode affects the operation of a terminal,
   therefore it must be supplied by an authorized server to an
   authorized terminal, it must not be altered in transit, and it must

   not be readable by an unauthorized third party.

   Logged signalling is privacy-sensitive data, therefore it must be
   passed to an authorized server, it must not be altered in transit,
   and it must not be readable by an unauthorized third party.
