Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
   Essential Connected Dominating Set (E-CDS) Process for Mobile Ad-Hoc
   Networks (MANETs).  The ECDS-MIB also reports state information,
   performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to
   configuration, the additional state and performance information is
   useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.

Internet-Draft                The ECDS-MIB                    April 2012


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   process implementing Essential Connected Dominating Set (E-CDS) [RFC
   5614] for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs).  E-CDS transforms 2-hop
   neighborhood topology information for routers to dynamically perform
   relay self election to form CDS.  The ECDS-MIB, an extension to SMF-
   MIB [draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-03], reports state information,
   performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to
   configuration, this additional state and performance information is
   useful to operators troubleshooting multicast forwarding problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the
   mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2,
   which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
   [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

4.  Overview

   E-CDS provides method for implementing selection of Multipoint Relay
   nodes that define an estimate of the Minimum Connected Dominating Set
   (MCDS) flooding.  The MCDS provides an efficient and complete
   coverage of the nodes comprising the MANET.  The packet forwarding
   rules does not require knowledge of previous hop discovery.  Routers
   that run Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) and have E-CDS enabled
   can be mixed with routers that run SMF and Classic Flooding (CF)
   enabled without a problem, even those are not participating in
   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [draft-ietf-manet-smf-14].
   Another benefit is that packets opportunistically received from non-
   symmetric neighbors may be forwarded without compromising flooding
   efficiency or correctness.  Furthermore, multicast sources not
   participating in NHDP may freely inject their traffic and any

   neighboring E-CDS relays will properly forward the traffic.  The
   E-CDS based relay set selection algorithm is based upon [RFC5614].

4.1.  ECDS-MIB Management Model

   As mentioned in Overview section, ECDS-MIB is an extension to SMF-
   MIB.  Meaning, the overall architecture is based on SMF.

   The Relay Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA) can rely upon topology
   information gotten from the MANET NHDP, from the specific MANET
   routing protocol running on the node, or from Layer 2 information
   passed up to the higher layer protocol processes.  As for ECDS,
   nodes, which select themselves as relays using router identifier and
   a nodal metric known as "Router Priority" for all one-hop and two-hop
   neighbors.  Differing Router Priority can result in different CDSs
   for a given network.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Control Objects - Objects which are initialized to default
      settings or set through the management interface defined by this
      MIB.

   o  State Objects - objects are automatically generated values which
      define the current operating state of the E-CDS process in the

      router.

   o  Performance Objects - objects are automatically generated values
      which help an administrator or automated tool to assess the
      performance of the CDS multicast process on the router and the
      overall multicasting performance within the MANET routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the ECDS-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions defined within the ECDS-MIB are as follows:

   o  EcdsStatus is defined within the ECDS-MIB.  This contains the
      current operational status of the E-CDS process on an interface.

   o  EcdsID represents an index that identifies a specific E-CDS
      operational mode.

5.2.  The Configuration Group

   The E-CDS device is configured with a set of controls.  Some of the
   prominent configuration controls for the SMF E-CDS device follow:

   o  E-CDS Operational Mode: indicates router has E-CDS enabled

   o  Router Identifier: indicates router's unique identifier in E-CDS
      neighborhood

   o  Router Priority: indicates nodal metric value for all one-hop and
      two-hop neighbors.

   o  Configuration method that computes Router Priority: indicates what
      method Router Priority is computed: dynamically configured,
      management configured, or other.

5.3.  The State Group

   The state of an ECDS device can be retrieved from the followings:

   o  E-CDS Operational State - is the node currently in or out of the
      Relay Set

   o  Current Router Priority value

Internet-Draft                The ECDS-MIB                    April 2012


5.4.  The Performance Group

   The E-CDS performance counters consist of per node objects:

   o  Counter of times the given node changed into or out of E-CDS.

   o  Counter of times the Router Priority has been changed.

5.5.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the ECDS-MIB and their intended purpose or utility.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The ECDS-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the SMF-MIB

   TBD

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The textual conventions imported for use in the SMF-MIB are as
   follows.  The MODULE-IDENTITY, OBJECT-TYPE, NOTIFICATION-TYPE,
   Counter32, Unsigned32, Integer32 and mib-2 textual conventions are
   imported from RFC 2578 [RFC2578].  The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, RowStatus
   and TruthValue textual conventions are imported from RFC 2579
   [RFC2579].  The MODULE-COMPLIANCE, OBJECT-GROUP and NOTIFICATIONGROUP
   textual conventions are imported from RFC 2580 [RFC2580].  The
   InterfaceIndexOrZero textual convention is imported from RFC 2863
   [RFC2863].  The SnmpAdminString textual convention is imported from
   RFC 3411 [RFC3411].  The InetAddress, InetAddressType and
   InetAddressPrefixLength textual conventions are imported from RFC
   4001 [RFC4001].
