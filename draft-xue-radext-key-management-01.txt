                   draft-xue-radext-key-management-01

Abstract

   It is a general case in operators networks that Authenticator is
   deployed on Service Gateway (SGW) to avoid overload on the Access
   Controller (AC).  In this scenario, the encryption/decryption node
   can't obtain Pairwise Master Key (PMK) information during Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP) procedure, it is not sufficent to
   achieve traffic encryption/decryption requirement in Wireless Local
   Area Network (WLAN) network.

   This document analyzes the requirement and issue for key management
   that has arisen so far during authentication process in WLAN network.
   Meanwhile, the control messages for key management are defined.

1.  Introduction

   The Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is becoming very popular,
   which is used in many industries (the financial, medical, and
   manufacturing, etc).  It features low cost and flexible network, and
   high speed wireless data access with open spectrum.  Besides, the
   WLAN technology is now used by more and more service operators to
   supplement cellular (2G/3G/LTE) network.

   Based on the WLAN security requirements mentioned in [IEEE-802.11i],
   keying material used for encryption and integrity algorithms MUST be
   obtained in the uniform authentication procedure.  During the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] procedure between
   Station (STA) and Authenticator Server (AS), Pairwise Master Key
   (PMK) will be generated as a side effect.  Moreover, AS distributes
   PMK to the Authenticator defined in[RFC3748].

   Then, the PMK and 4-way handshake [IEEE-802.11i]are used to derive,
   bind and verify the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which is a
   collection of operational keys for secure between STA and encryption/
   decryption node.  Also,Group Transient Key (GTK) can be derived, and
   is used to secure multicast/ broadcast traffic between STA and
   encryption/decryption node.

   However, in practice, it is a general case in operators networks that
   Authenticator is deployed on Service Gateway (SGW) to avoid overload

   on the Access Controller (AC).  In this scenario, the encryption/
   decryption node can't obtain PMK information during EAP procedure, it
   is not sufficient to achieve traffic encryption/decryption
   requirement in WLAN network.

   This document analyzes the requirement and issue for key management
   that has arisen so far during authentication process in WLAN network.
   Meanwhile, the control messages for key management are defined.

   The specification described in this document is applicable if
   authenticator function is not collocated with the encryption/
   decryption function in WLAN.  It is recommended for WLAN network
   deployment as informational.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terminologies.

   Wireless Termination Point (WTP)

   The physical or logical network entity that contains an RF antenna
   and wireless physical layer (PHY) to transmit and receive station
   traffic for wireless access networks.  This definition has the same
   meaning used in [RFC4118].

   Access Controller (AC)

   The network entity that provides WTP access to the network
   infrastructure in the data plane, control plane, management plane, or
   a combination therein, as defined in [RFC4118]

   Authentication Server(AS)

   An entity that provides an authentication service to an
   authenticator.  This service determines, from the credentials
   provided by the Supplicant, whether the Supplicant is authorized to
   access the services provided by the system in which the authenticator
   resides.  AS is generally located on the backend AAA server.

   Authenticator

Internet-Draft          key management via radius              July 2013


   An entity that facilitates authentication of other entities attached
   to the same LAN.  The term authenticator is also used in [RFC3748],
   and has the same meaning in this document.

   Service Gateway (SGW)

   A device in operator access network, who can charge the subscriber
   authentication.  It maybe BRAS (Broadband Remote Access Server) or
   BNG (Broadband Network Gateway).

   Supplicant

   Supplicant is kind of device in authentication.  A device at one end
   of a point-to-point LAN segment seeks to be authenticated by an
   Authenticator.  It is the same as the Peer defined in [RFC3748].  The
   supplicant is station (STA) in WLAN network.

   Station (STA)

   A device that contains an interface to a wireless medium.  User
   equipment (UE) with (U)SIM is one type of STA.  In authentication
   procedure, STA is the Supplicant.

   Pairwise Master Key (PMK)

   PMK is a fresh symmetric key controlling STA's and the encryption/
   decryption node (WTP or AC) access to 802.11 channel during the
   session.

   Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)

   PTK is used to encrypt/decrypt unicast traffic for supplicant, which
   is derived from the 4-way handshake [IEEE-802.11i].

   Group Temporal Key (GTK)

   GTK is used to encrypt/decrypt multicast/broadcast traffic for
   supplicant, which is derived from the 4-way handshake[IEEE-802.11i].

4.  Problem Statement

   In practice, ACs are deployed on the centralized center in existing
   operator networks.  In order to avoid the traffic overload on AC,
   WTPs forward the wireless frames directly to SGW deployed in the
   network.  The AC does not have the intelligence to aggregate all the
   wireless frames.  An illustration of the WLAN centralized
   architecture is shown as follows.

                  Figure 1 WLAN Centralized Architecture

   In EAP framework, SGW could act as the Authenticator instead of AC
   because of several reasons.  First of all, a powerful AC that
   aggregates the Authenticator function is not a appreciated choice for
   some operators.There are large numbers of AC devices in the operators
   existing network.  The AS will overload the communication with large
   numbers of AC devices if ACs acts as the Authenticator.  On the other
   hand, SGW MUST support the RADIUS Relay function when AC acts as the
   Authenticator in EAP framework.  In this scenario, both SGW and AC
   should be responsible for authentication procedure.  For operators,
   it is cost in large-scale upgraded deployment.  Consequently,it is a
   popular scenario for operator to deploy the EAP Authenticator on SGW.

   Unfortunately, the Authenticator SGW is the only node which can
   obtain the derived PMK,except of STA and AS.  But AC is supposed to
   deliver the PMK to the WTP to guarantee the security requirement, and
   there is not standard interface for SGW sending the PMK to the WTP or
   the AC.  The authentication procedure when SGW acting as
   Authenticator is shown as following figure.

   In this document, the mechanism is specified to inform the PMK to
   ecryption/decryption node, which is the WTP or AC.

   Figure 2 Authentication Procedure When SGW Deployed as Authenticator

5.  Protocol overview

   Based on the analysis above, it is recommended that control messages
   used for PMK announcement from SGW to WTP/AC should be defined when
   SGW acts the EAP Authenticator.

   If AC is the encryption/decryption node, the SGW sends the PMK to AC
   via these control messages.  If WTP is the encryption/decryption
   node, the SGW sends the PMK to AC as well, then AC sends the obtained
   PMK to WTP via protocol defined in [RFC4564].  However, the SGW can
   send the PMK to WTP directly, which conforms to the mechine defined
   in this document.

   As we know, RADIUS attributes are comprised of variable length Type-
   Length-Vaule 3 tuples.  New attribute values can be added without
   disturbing existing implementation of the protocol.  This document
   describes the RADIUS extension to support the PMK announcement
   between SGW and WTP/AC.  Specially, new RADIUS messages, including
   Key-of-Announcement(KoA) message, KoA-ACK/NAK message, are defined.

5.1.  PMK Announcement Messages

   There are three messages defined for PMK announcement, shown in
   following figures.

                    Figure 3 PMK Announcement Messages

   o  During the authentication procedure, when SGW obtains the PMK from
      AS, the SGW initiates the KoA message and send it to the AC.

   o  If AC is able to obtain the PMK successfully, AC responds the KoA
      ACK message to SGW.  Otherwise, AC responds the KoA NAK message to
      SGW.

   The format for PMK announcement messages is shown as follows.

   1 Mutual authentication procedure as general defined in
   [RFC3748][IEEE-802.1X].

   2 After EAP authentication completes, the SGW acting as Authenticator
   initiates and transmits the KoA packet to AC via KoA message.  It is
   desirable to provide keying information needed based on
   [IEEE-802.11i].

   3 AC should interpret the KoA message and obtain the PMK included in
   Keying-material attribute as an indication that the AS has
   successfully authenticated the STA.  If AC is able to get the PMK
   successfully, AC responds the KoA ACK message to SGW.  Otherwise, AC
   responds the KoA NAK message to SGW.

   Additionally, the derived PMK can be used with 4-Way Handshake to
   derive, bind, and verify PTK or GTK, which is out of the scope.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

8.  Security Considerations

   The security must be guaranteed between the SGW and the WTP/AC for
   key announcement.  If there is security requirements, IPsec tunnel or
   MD5 encryption/decryption algorithm between SGW and WTP/AC are
   needed.
