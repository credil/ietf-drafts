              A YANG Data Model for Routing Configuration
                    draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg-03

Abstract

   This document contains a specification of three YANG modules.
   Together they form the core routing data model which serves as a
   framework for configuring a routing subsystem.  It is therefore
   expected that this module will be augmented by additional YANG
   modules defining data models for individual routing protocols and
   other related functions.  The core routing data model provides common
   building blocks for such configurations - router instances, routes,
   routing tables, routing protocols and route filters.

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration               May 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document contains a specification of the following YANG modules:

   o  Module "ietf-routing" provides generic components of a routing
      data model.

   o  Module "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" augments the "ietf-routing"
      module with additional data specific to IPv4 unicast.

   o  Module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" augments the "ietf-routing"
      module with additional data specific to IPv6 unicast, including
      the router configuration variables required by [RFC4861].

   These modules together define the so-called core routing data model,
   which is proposed as a basis for the development of data models for
   more sophisticated routing configurations.  While these three modules
   can be directly used for simple IP devices with static routing, their
   main purpose is to provide essential building blocks for more
   complicated setups involving multiple routing protocols, multicast
   routing, additional address families, advanced functions such as
   route filtering or policy routing etc.  To this end, it is expected
   that the core routing data model will be augmented by numerous
   modules developed by other IETF working groups.

   active route:  a route which is actually used for sending packets.
      If there are multiple candidate routes with a matching destination
      prefix, then it is up to the routing algorithm to select the
      active route (or several active routes in the case of multi-path
      routing).

   core routing data model:  YANG data model resulting from the
      combination of "ietf-routing", "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" and
      "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" modules.

   direct route:  a route to a directly connected network.

2.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes are used mostly without a
   prefix, as long as it is clear from the context in which YANG module
   each name is defined.  Otherwise, names are prefixed using the
   standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG module, as
   shown in Table 1.

3.  Objectives

   The initial design of the core routing data model was driven by the
   following objectives:

   o  The data model should be suitable for the common address families,
      in particular IPv4 and IPv6, and for unicast and multicast
      routing, as well as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS).

   o  Simple routing setups, such as static routing, should be
      configurable in a simple way, ideally without any need to develop
      additional YANG modules.

   o  On the other hand, the core routing framework must allow for
      complicated setups involving multiple routing tables and multiple
      routing protocols, as well as controlled redistributions of
      routing information.

   o  Device vendors will want to map the data models built on this
      generic framework to their proprietary data models and
      configuration interfaces.  Therefore, the framework should be
      flexible enough to facilitate such a mapping and accommodate data
      models with different logic.

4.  The Design of the Core Routing Data Model

   The core routing data model consists of three YANG modules.  The
   first module, "ietf-routing", defines the generic components of a
   routing system.  The other two modules, "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing"
   and "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing", augment the "ietf-routing" module
   with additional data nodes that are needed for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast
   routing, respectively.  The combined data hierarchy is shown in
   Figure 1, where brackets enclose list keys, "rw" means configuration,
   "ro" operational state data, and "?" means optional node.
   Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
   marked with a colon (":").

   As can be seen from Figure 1, the core routing data model introduces
   several generic components of a routing framework: routers, routing
   tables containing routes, routing protocols and route filters.  The
   following subsections describe these components in more detail.

   By combining the components in various ways, and possibly augmenting
   them with appropriate contents defined in other modules, various
   routing setups can be realized.

             Figure 2: Example setup of the routing subsystem

   The example in Figure 2 shows a typical (though certainly not the
   only possible) organization of a more complex routing subsystem for a
   single address family.  Several of its features are worth mentioning:

   o  Along with the main routing table, which must always be present,
      an additional routing table is configured.

   o  Each routing protocol instance, including the "static" and
      "direct" pseudo-protocols, is connected to one routing table with
      which it can exchange routes (in both directions, except for the
      "static" and "direct" pseudo-protocols).

   o  Routing tables may also be connected to each other and exchange
      routes in either direction (or both).

   o  Route exchanges along all connections may be controlled by means
      of route filters, denoted by "F" in Figure 2.

4.1.  Router

   Each router instance in the core routing data model represents a
   logical router.  The exact semantics of this term is left to
   implementations.  For example, router instances may be completely
   isolated virtual routers or, alternatively, they may internally share
   certain information.

   Network layer interfaces must be assigned to a router instance in
   order to be able to participate in packet forwarding, routing
   protocols and other operations of that router instance.  The
   assignment is accomplished by creating a corresponding entry in the
   list of router interfaces ("rt:interface").  The key of the list
   entry MUST be the name of a configured network layer interface, i.e.,
   the value of a node /if:interfaces/if:interface/if:name defined in
   the "ietf-interfaces" module.[YANG-IF].

   Implementations MAY specify additional rules for the assignment of
   interfaces to logical routers.  For example, it may be required that
   the sets of interfaces assigned to different logical routers be
   disjoint.

   Apart from the key, each entry of the "rt:interface" list MAY contain
   other configuration or operational state data related to the
   corresponding router interface.

4.1.1.  Configuration of IPv6 Router Interfaces

   The module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" augments the definition of the
   data node "rt:interface" with definitions of the following
   configuration variables as required by [RFC4861], sec. 6.2.1:

   o  send-advertisements,

   o  max-rtr-adv-interval,

   o  min-rtr-adv-interval,

   o  managed-flag,

   o  other-config-flag,

   o  link-mtu,

   o  reachable-time,

   o  retrans-timer,

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration               May 2012


   o  cur-hop-limit,

   o  default-lifetime,

   o  prefix-list: a list of prefixes to be advertised.  The following
      parameters are associated with each prefix in the list:

      *  valid-lifetime,

      *  on-link-flag,

      *  preferred-lifetime,

      *  autonomous-flag.

   The definitions and descriptions of the above parameters can be found
   in the text of the module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" (Section 8).

   NOTE: The "IsRouter" flag, which is also required by [RFC4861], is
   implemented by the "ietf-ip" module [YANG-IP] (leaf "ip:ip-
   forwarding").

4.2.  Route

   Routes are basic units of information in a routing system.  The core
   routing data model defines only the following minimal set of route
   attributes:

   o  "destination-prefix": IP prefix specifying the set of destination
      addresses for which the route may be used.  This attribute is
      mandatory.

   o  "next-hop": IP address of the adjacent router or host to which
      packets with destination addresses belonging to destination-prefix
      should be sent.

   o  "outgoing-interface": network interface that should be used for
      sending packets with destination addresses belonging to
      destination-prefix.

   The above list of route attributes should suffice for a simple static
   routing configuration.  It is expected that future modules defining
   routing protocols will add other route attributes such as metrics or
   preferences.

   Routes and their attributes are used both in configuration data, for
   example as manually configured static routes, and in operational
   state data, for example as entries in routing tables.

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration               May 2012


4.3.  Routing Tables

   Routing tables are lists of routes complemented with administrative
   data, namely:

   o  "source-protocol": name of the routing protocol from which the
      route was originally obtained.

   o  "age": number of seconds since the route was created or last
      updated.

   Each routing table may only contain routes of the same address
   family.  Address family information consists of two parameters -
   "address-family" and "safi" (Subsequent Address Family Identifier,
   SAFI).  The permitted values for these two parameters are defined by
   IANA and translated into YANG enumeration types "ianaaf:address-
   family" and "ianaaf:subsequent-address-family" [IANA-IF-AF].

   In the core routing data model, the "routing-table" node represents
   configuration while the descendant list of routes is defined as
   operational state data.  The contents of route lists are controlled
   and manipulated by routing protocol operations which may result in
   route additions, removals and modifications.  This also includes
   manipulations via the "static" and/or "direct" pseudo-protocols, see
   Section 4.4.1.

   One routing table MUST be present for each router instance and each
   address family supported by that router instance.  It is the so-
   called main routing table to which all routing protocol instances
   supporting the given address family SHOULD be connected by default.
   For the two address families that are part of the core routing data
   model, the names of the main routing tables SHOULD be as follows:

   o  "main-ipv4-unicast" for IPv4 unicast,

   o  "main-ipv6-unicast" for IPv6 unicast.

   Additional routing tables MAY be configured by creating new entries
   in the "routing-table" list, either as a part of factory-default
   configuration, or by a client's action.

   The naming scheme for additional routing tables, as well as
   restrictions on the number and configurability of routing tables are
   implementation-specific.

   The way how the routing system uses information from routing tables
   is outside the scope of this document.  Typically, implementations
   will either use a forwarding table, or perform a direct look-up in



Lhotka                  Expires November 26, 2012              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration               May 2012


   the main routing table in conjunction with a route cache.

   Every routing table can serve as a source of routes for other routing
   tables.  To achieve this, one or more recipient routing tables may be
   specified in the configuration of the source routing table.  In
   addition, a route filter may be configured for each recipient routing
   table, which selects and/or manipulates the routes that are passed on
   between the source and recipient routing table.

4.4.  Routing Protocols

   The core routing data model provides an open-ended framework for
   defining multiple routing protocol instances.  Each of them is
   identified by a name, which MUST be unique within a router instance.
   Each protocol MUST be assigned a type, which MUST be an identity
   derived from the "rt:routing-protocol" base identity.  The core
   routing data model defines two identities for the direct and static
   pseudo-protocols (Section 4.4.1).

   Each routing protocol instance is connected to exactly one routing
   table for each address family that the routing protocol instance
   supports.  By default, every routing protocol instance SHOULD be
   connected to the main routing table or tables.  An implementation MAY
   allow any or all routing protocol instances to be configured to use a
   different routing table.

   Routes learned from the network by a routing protocol are passed to
   the connected routing table(s) and vice versa - routes appearing in a
   routing table are passed to all routing protocols connected to the
   table (except "direct" and "static" pseudo-protocols) and may be
   advertised by that protocol to the network.

   Two independent route filters (see Section 4.5) may be defined for a
   routing protocol instance to control the exchange of routes in both
   directions between the routing protocol instance and the connected
   routing table:

   o  import filter controls which routes are passed from a routing
      protocol instance to the routing table,

   o  export filter controls which routes the routing protocol instance
      may receive from the connected routing table.

   Note that, for historical reasons, the terms import and export are
   used from the viewpoint of a routing table.

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration               May 2012


4.4.1.  Routing Pseudo-Protocols

   The core routing data model defines two special routing protocol
   types - "direct" and "static".  Both are in fact pseudo-protocols,
   which means that they are confined to the local device and do not
   exchange any routing information with neighboring routers.  Routes
   from both "direct" and "static" protocol instances are passed to the
   connected routing table (subject to route filters, if any), but an
   exchange in the opposite direction is not allowed.

   Every router instance MUST contain exactly one instance of the
   "direct" pseudo-protocol type.  The name of this instance MUST also
   be "direct".  It is the source of direct routes for all configured
   address families.  Direct routes are normally supplied by the
   operating system kernel, based on the configuration of network
   interface addresses, see Section 5.2.  Direct routes SHOULD by
   default appear in the main routing table for each configured address
   family.  However, using the framework defined in this document, the
   target routing table for direct routes MAY be changed by connecting
   the "direct" protocol instance to a non-default routing table.
   Direct routes can also be filtered before they appear in the routing
   table.

   A pseudo-protocol of the type "static" allows for specifying routes
   manually.  It MAY be configured in zero or multiple instances,
   although a typical implementation will have exactly one instance per
   logical router.

4.4.2.  Defining New Routing Protocols

   It is expected that future YANG modules will create data models for
   additional routing protocol types.  Such a new module has to define
   the protocol-specific configuration and operational state data, and
   fit it into the core routing framework in the following way :

   o  A new identity MUST be defined for the routing protocol and its
      base identity MUST be set to "rt:routing-protocol", or to an
      identity derived from "rt:routing-protocol".

   o  Additional route attributes MAY be defined, preferably in one
      place by means of defining a YANG grouping.  The new attributes
      have to be inserted as operational state data by augmenting the
      definition of "rt:route" inside "rt:routing-table", and possibly
      to other places in the configuration, operational state data and
      RPC input or output.

   o  Per-interface configuration parameters can be added by augmenting
      the data node "rt:interface" (the list of router interfaces).

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration               May 2012


   o  Other configuration parameters and operational state data can be
      defined by augmenting the "routing-protocol" data node.  By using
      the "when" statement, this augment SHOULD be made conditional and
      valid only if the value of the "rt:type" child leaf equals to the
      new protocol's identity.

   It is RECOMMENDED that both per-interface and other configuration
   data specific to the new protocol be encapsulated in an appropriately
   named container.

   The above steps are implemented by the example YANG module for the
   RIP routing protocol in Appendix A.  First, the module defines a new
   identity for the RIP protocol:

   identity rip {
     base rt:routing-protocol;
     description "Identity for the RIP routing protocol.";
   }

   New route attributes specific to the RIP protocol ("metric" and
   "tag") are defined in a grouping and then added to the route
   definitions appearing in "routing-table" and in the output part of
   the "active-route" RPC method:

     leaf metric {
       type rip-metric;
     }
     leaf tag {

       default "0";
       description
         "This leaf may be used to carry additional info, e.g. AS
          number.";

   }

         + "rt:routes/rt:route" {

        + "rt:routing-protocol[rt:name=current()/rt:source-protocol]/"
        + "rt:type='rip:rip'" {

         "This augment is only valid if the source protocol from which
          the route originated is RIP.";

   }

   augment "/rt:active-route/rt:output/rt:route" {
     description
       "Add RIP-specific route content.";
     uses route-content;
   }

   Per-interface configuration data are defined by the following
   "augment" statement:

   augment "/rt:routing/rt:router/rt:interfaces/rt:interface" {

        + "'rip:rip'";
     container rip {
       description
         "Per-interface RIP configuration.";
       leaf enabled {
         type boolean;
         default "true";
       }
       leaf metric {
         type rip-metric;
         default "1";
       }
     }
   }

   Finally, global RIP configuration data are integrated into the "rt:
   routing-protocol" node by using the following "augment" statement,
   which is valid only for routing protocol instances whose type is
   "rip:rip":

   augment "/rt:routing/rt:router/rt:routing-protocols/"
         + "rt:routing-protocol" {
     when "rt:type = 'rip:rip'";
     container rip {
       leaf update-interval {
         type uint8 {
           range "10..60";
         }
         units "seconds";
         default "30";
         description
           "Time interval between periodic updates.";
       }
     }
   }

4.5.  Route Filters

   The core routing data model provides a skeleton for defining route
   filters that can be used to restrict the set of routes being
   exchanged between a routing protocol instance and a connected routing
   table, or between a source and a recipient routing table.  Route
   filters may also manipulate routes, i.e., add, delete, or modify
   their attributes.

   Route filters are global, which means that a configured route filter

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration               May 2012


   may be used by any or all router instances.

   By itself, the route filtering framework defined in this document
   allows for applying only the extreme routing policies which are
   represented by the following pre-defined route filter types:

   o  "deny-all-route-filter": all routes are blocked,

   o  "allow-all-route-filter": all routes are permitted.

   It is expected that real route filtering frameworks will be developed
   separately.

   Each route filter is identified by a name which MUST be unique within
   a router instance.  Its type MUST be specified by the "type" identity
   reference - this opens the space for multiple route filtering
   framework implementations.  The default value for the route filter
   type is the identity "deny-all-route-filter".

4.6.  RPC Operations

   The "ietf-routing" module defines two RPC operations:

   o  active-route,

   o  route-count.

   Their parameters and semantics are described in the following
   subsections.

4.6.1.  Operation "active-route"

   Description:  Retrieve one or more active routes from the forwarding
      information base (FIB) of a router instance, i.e., the route(s)
      that are currently used by that router instance for sending
      datagrams to the destination whose address is provided as an input
      parameter.

   Parameters:

      router-name:  Name of the router instance whose FIB is to be
         queried.

      destination-address:  Network layer destination address for which
         the active routes are requested.

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration               May 2012


   Positive Response:  One or more "route" elements containing the
      active route(s).

   Negative Response:

      If the logical router is not found, the server sends an "rpc-
      error" message with "error-tag" set to "missing-element", and
      "error-app-tag" set to "router-not-found".

      If no route exists for the given destination address, the server
      sends an "rpc-error" message with "error-tag" set to "data-
      missing" and "error-app-tag" set to "no-route".

4.6.2.  Operation "route-count"

   Description:  Retrieve the total number of routes in a routing table.

   Parameters:

      router-name:  Name of the logical router containing the routing
         table.

      routing-table:  Name of the routing table.

   Positive Response:  Element "number-of-routes" containing the
      requested nonnegative number.

   Negative Response:  If the logical router or the routing table is not
      found, the server sends an "rpc-error" message with "error-tag"
      set to "missing-element", and "error-app-tag" set to "router-not-
      found" or "routing-table-not-found", respectively.

5.  Interactions with Other YANG Modules

   The semantics of the core routing data model also depends on several
   configuration parameters that are defined in other YANG modules.  The
   following subsections describe these interactions.

5.1.  Module "ietf-interfaces"

   The following boolean switch is defined in the "ietf-interfaces" YANG
   module [YANG-IF]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/if:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a given network layer
      interface, the device MUST behave exactly as if that interface was
      not assigned to any logical router at all.

5.2.  Module "ietf-ip"

   The following boolean switches are defined in the "ietf-ip" YANG
   module [YANG-IP]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a given interface, then all
      IPv4 routing functions related to that interface MUST be disabled.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:ip-forwarding

      If this switch is set to "false" for a given interface, then the
      forwarding of IPv4 datagrams to and from this interface MUST be
      disabled.  However, the interface may participate in other routing
      functions, such as routing protocols.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a given interface, then all
      IPv6 routing functions related to that interface MUST be disabled.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:ip-forwarding

      If this switch is set to "false" for a given interface, then the
      forwarding of IPv6 datagrams to and from this interface MUST be
      disabled.  However, the interface may participate in other routing
      functions, such as routing protocols.

   In addition, the "ietf-ip" module allows for configuring IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses and subnet masks.  Configuration of these parameters

   on an enabled interface MUST result in an immediate creation of the
   corresponding direct route (usually in the main routing table).  Its
   destination prefix is set according to the configured IP address and
   subnet mask, and the interface is set as the outgoing interface for
   that route.

10.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be accessed
   via the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].

   A number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules are writable/
   creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true" in YANG terms, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations to these data nodes,
   such as "edit-config", can have negative effects on the network if
   the protocol operations are not properly protected.

   The vulnerable "config true" subtrees and data nodes are the
   following:

   /rt:routing/rt:router/rt:interfaces/rt:interface  This list assigns a
      network layer interface to a router instance and may also specify
      interface parameters related to routing.

   /rt:routing/rt:router/rt:routing-protocols/rt:routing-protocol  This
      list specifies the routing protocols configured on a device.

   /rt:routing/rt:router/rt:route-filters/rt:route-filter  This list
      specifies the configured route filters which represent the
      administrative policies for redistributing and modifying routing
      information.

   Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect the
   routing subsystem of both the local device and the network.  This may
   lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets to inappropriate
   destinations and other problems.

Appendix A.  Example: Adding a New Routing Protocol

   This appendix demonstrates how the core routing data model can be
   extended to support a new routing protocol.  The YANG module
   "example-rip" shown below is intended only as an illustration rather
   than a real definition of a data model for the RIP routing protocol.
   For the sake of brevity, we do not follow all the guidelines
   specified in [RFC6087].  See also Section 4.4.2.

Appendix B.  Example: Reply to the NETCONF <get> Message

   This section contains a sample reply to the NETCONF <get> message,
   which could be sent by a server supporting (i.e., advertising them in
   the NETCONF <hello> message) the following YANG modules:

   o  ietf-interfaces [YANG-IF],

   o  ietf-ip [YANG-IP],

   o  ietf-routing (Section 6),

   o  ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing (Section 7),

   o  ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing (Section 8).

   We assume a simple network setup as shown in Figure 3: router "A"
   uses static default routes with the "ISP" router as the next hop.
   IPv6 router advertisements are configured only on the "eth1"
   interface and disabled on the upstream "eth0" interface.

Appendix C.  Change Log

   RFC Editor: remove this section upon publication as an RFC.

C.1.  Changes Between Versions -02 and -03

   o  Module "iana-afn-safi" moved to I-D "iana-if-type".

   o  Removed forwarding table.

   o  RPC "get-route" changed to "active-route".  Its output is a list
      of routes (for multi-path routing).

   o  New RPC "route-count".

   o  For both RPCs, specification of negative responses was added.

   o  Relaxed separation of router instances.

   o  Assignment of interfaces to router instances needn't be disjoint.

   o  Route filters are now global.

   o  Added "allow-all-route-filter" for symmetry.

   o  Added Section 5 about interactions with "ietf-interfaces" and
      "ietf-ip".

   o  Added "router-id" leaf.

   o  Specified the names for IPv4/IPv6 unicast main routing tables.

   o  Route parameter "last-modified" changed to "age".

   o  Added container "recipient-routing-tables".

C.2.  Changes Between Versions -01 and -02

   o  Added module "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing".

   o  The example in Appendix B now uses IP addresses from blocks
      reserved for documentation.

   o  Direct routes appear by default in the FIB table.

   o  Network layer interfaces must be assigned to a router instance.
      Additional interface configuration may be present.

   o  The "when" statement is only used with "augment", "must" is used
      elsewhere.

   o  Additional "must" statements were added.

   o  The "route-content" grouping for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast now
      includes the material from the "ietf-routing" version via "uses
      rt:route-content".

   o  Explanation of symbols in the tree representation of data model
      hierarchy.

C.3.  Changes Between Versions -00 and -01

   o  AFN/SAFI-independent stuff was moved to the "ietf-routing" module.

   o  Typedefs for AFN and SAFI were placed in a separate "iana-afn-
      safi" module.

   o  Names of some data nodes were changed, in particular "routing-
      process" is now "router".

   o  The restriction of a single AFN/SAFI per router was lifted.

   o  RPC operation "delete-route" was removed.

   o  Illegal XPath references from "get-route" to the datastore were
      fixed.

   o  Section "Security Considerations" was written.
