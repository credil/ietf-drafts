                    draft-beauchamp-private-wire-07

Abstract

   Application level data exchanged using the SIP INFO method are
   supported and documented in specifications known as 'INFO Packages'.
   This document defines functionality associated with Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) Private Wire functionality and creates an
   'INFO Package' for carrying such application level data.

1.  Introduction

   Private Wire (PW) is a generic term used to describe static point to
   point voice connections between two locations.  Private Wires are
   used by a number of communities such as Military, Railways, 911/999
   Services and Financial Services.  This document will primarily deal
   with the Financial Services Industry however it should be equally
   applicable to other communities.

Internet-Draft      SIP INFO Package for Private Wire          July 2013


   The aim is to define a SIP based emulation of existing Private Wire
   circuits so that interoperability can be attained between existing
   digital and analogue equipment and the new generation of SIP based
   technology.

   This document does not seek to add functionality above the existing
   Private Wire experience or to define new financial services that may
   be possible using SIP interconnections between trading systems.

   Financial Institutions are traditional early adopters of
   telecommunications technology.  The phone became so important that
   any loss of service could result in huge losses in the markets.
   Traders and brokers in particular were quick to realise some of the
   short comings of PSTN interconnection when used for voice trading,
   such as:-

   o  Slow speed of dialling especially with rotary dials.

   o  Slow speed of connection which could lead to missing first part of
      conversation.

   o  No ability for their calls to be given high priority in the PSTN
      so calls would not get through.

   o  Far end was on a call to someone else and so would not answer.

   To solve these issues the financial communities took advantage of the
   fact that their offices in any given location were very close to all
   the offices of their trading partners and started to run direct
   private connections between themselves.

   It is the intention of this document to create SIP based Private Wire
   functionality that will enable new systems to provide equivalent
   functionality in an interoperable form.  This includes interoperation
   with legacy systems.

   A SIP based solution uses core SIP functionality to enable a device
   compliant to this specification to signal information specifically
   related to a Private Wire.  In its most simplistic form the SIP
   signalling, as illustrated in Figure 1, representing a Private Wire
   is re-used with extensions defined in this specification which
   imitates legacy functionality (intermediaries left out for
   simplicity).

   While it is envisioned that all existing deployments will move to a
   SIP based solution it must be recognised that the majority of
   deployments using this specification will be interacting with legacy
   Private Wire systems for the foreseeable future, as illustrated in
   Figure 2.

   This specification will define a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   INFO package, as defined in [RFC6086], for the purpose of mid call
   signalling related to Private Wire functionality.  The remainder of
   this specification will define the appropriate level of detail from
   both a functional and standardisation perspective.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

Internet-Draft      SIP INFO Package for Private Wire          July 2013


   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the key words
   "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL".  In addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   The following additional terms are defined for use in this document:

   Private Wire (PW) :  generic term used to describe static point to
      point communication connections between two locations.

3.  Overview of Operation

   The use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Private Wire
   communication allows for migration of existing functionality and
   deployments.  It also provides an appropriate foundation for future
   extensions to enhance Private Wire functionality.

   A SIP Private Wire will make use of existing SIP standards as well as
   the extensions defined in this document - as covered in the remainder
   of this section.

   A SIP based Private Wire will be established as any other INVITE
   dialog specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261] with the following additional
   steps:

   o  On constructing the initial INVITE request the User Agent Client
      (UAC) MUST include a SIP 'Recv-info' header (as defined in
      [RFC6086] with a value of 'pw-info-package'.  The 'pw-type'
      parameter MUST also be included with an appropriate value.

   o  On constructing a reliable response (as defined in [RFC3261]) to
      the INVITE request the SIP 'Recv-info' header MUST be included
      with a value of 'pw-info-package'.  The 'pw-type' parameter MUST
      also be included with an appropriate value.  An entity receiving a
      SIP INVITE request/response MUST NOT issue commands for this INFO
      package if the SIP 'Recv-info' header is not present.

   o  All SIP INFO messages defined in this package for Private Wire
      signalling MUST contain the SIP 'Info-Package' header with a value
      of 'pw-info-package'.

   A SIP entity that receives a Private Wire SIP INVITE request for a
   domain that it controls (appears in the host part of the SIP URI) but
   does not recognise the user part MUST issue a SIP 404 response if no
   other routing path is defined.  A SIP entity that receives a Private
   Wire SIP INVITE request for a domain that it controls (appears in the
   host part of the SIP URI) but has definitive knowledge that the

Internet-Draft      SIP INFO Package for Private Wire          July 2013


   Private Wire is out of service, MUST issue a SIP 480 response.
   Overlapping SIP INVITE transactions MUST be treated as per described
   in Section 3.1.

   The INVITE dialog establishing a SIP Private Wire MUST comply to
   appropriate security procedures as set out in Section 4.  A SIP
   Private Wire SHOULD use TCP as the signalling protocol but MAY choose
   to use an alternative transport protocol if appropriate.

   A SIP endpoint configured to initiate a SIP Private Wire MUST also
   support the 'Session Timer' extension as specified in RFC 4028
   [RFC4028].  It is important that a SIP Private Wire is always
   available and so early detection of failure is important to the
   service.  A SIP endpoint initiating a SIP Private wire should pick a
   refresh interval in association with [RFC4028] that is suitable for
   the system.  A refresh interval of 120 seconds is RECOMMENDED.  On
   detection of failure, a SIP endpoint MUST attempt to re-establish the
   SIP Private Wire immediately.

   While an active SIP based Private Wire is established, a user may
   wish to signal certain events to the far end of the SIP INVITE
   dialog.  To achieve the SIP INFO method is used in association with
   the INFO Package defined in this specification.  More specifically,
   an endpoint wishing to signal Private Wire related information to the
   receiving end MUST comply to the SIP INFO package specification
   defined in Section 4.  This primarily involves the ability to:

   o  Signal 'On Hook' and 'Off Hook' state.

   o  Signal 'Ringdown' state (play locally configured alert).

   o  Provide Transmission Only Service(TOS) Private Wire.

   A SIP endpoint not compliant to this specification can still
   successfully interoperate with a compliant device but will not be
   able to take advantage of the specific Private Wire functionality
   defined in this document.

3.1.  Overlapping Requests

   In the event that two endpoints actively attempting to connect a
   Private Wire call at the same time, an endpoint should be able to
   detect and resolve this situation.  On receiving an incoming request
   to a well known Private Wire identifier the endpoint MUST check to
   see if it has an active INVITE transaction for the same Private Wire.
   If the endpoint does have an active INVITE transaction it MUST:

Internet-Draft      SIP INFO Package for Private Wire          July 2013


   o  Generate a SIP 486 Busy Here response to the incoming INVITE
      transaction associated with the Private Wire.

   o  Include a SIP 'Retry-After' header[RFC3261] in the 486 with an
      appropriate value which should reflect a point in the future when
      a new attempt might succeed.  As a guideline this figure should be
      greater than the remaining amount of time left for the current
      outgoing Private Wire INVITE transaction.

   o  Include a SIP Reason header[RFC3261] in the 486 with the value
      'Reason: SIP;cause=486;text="Overlapping PW Establishment"'.

3.2.  Incorrect Private Wire Type

   A SIP INVITE compliant to this specification MUST include a 'Recv-
   Info' header, as defined further in Section 6.  An endpoint receiving
   a 'Recv-Info' header with a value that is not supported should
   respond with a SIP '469 Bad Info Package', as defined in [RFC6086].

4.  Private Wire Package Definition

4.1.  Overall Description

   An Overall Description of the Private Wire INFO package can be found
   in Section 3.

4.2.  Applicability

   The SIP INFO package mechanism was chosen for the purpose of carrying
   Private Wire application level information as it offered the most
   appropriate solution.  Using a SIP INFO package encourages signalling
   to be viewed by appropriate intermediaries in Trading System
   architectures.

4.3.  INFO Package Name

   This document defines a SIP INFO Package as defined in [RFC6086].
   The INFO Package token name for this package is "pw-info-package".

4.4.  INFO Package Parameters

   This document defines a single INFO package parameter.  See Section 6
   for the definition of the 'pwtype' INFO package parameter.

4.5.  SIP OPTION tags

   See Section 7.

Internet-Draft      SIP INFO Package for Private Wire          July 2013


4.6.  INFO Message Body Parts

   A client conforming to this specification MUST include a compliant
   payload in a SIP INFO message that conforms to the XML schema defined
   in Section 9.  The MIME type MUST be of type 'application/pw-
   info+xml' as defined in Section 12.1.

5.  Element Definitions

   This section defines the XML elements for this package.  The elements
   are defined in the XML namespace specified in Section 9.

   The root element is <pwsignal>.  All other elements are contained
   within it.  Child elements are <ringDown> and <hookSwitch>.  The
   <ringDown> element is described in Section 5.1.1.  The <hookSwitch>
   element is described in Section 5.1.2.

   Implementations of this specification MUST address the Security
   Considerations described in Section 11.  Implementations of this
   specification MUST adhere to the syntax and semantics defined in this
   section and the schema in Section 9.  If there is a difference in
   constraints between the XML schema and the textual description of
   elements in this section, the textual definition takes priority.

   The XML schema supports extensibility by allowing attributes and
   elements from other namespaces.  Implementations MAY support
   additional capabilities by means of attributes and elements from
   other (foreign) namespaces.  Attributes and elements from foreign
   namespaces are not described in this section.

5.1.  <pwSignal>

   The <pwSignal> element has no attributes in addition to the standard
   XML namespace attributes such as xmlns.

   The <pwSignal> element has two child elements of which only one can
   occur per message.:

   o  <ringDown> - defined in Section 5.1.1.

   o  <hookSwitch> - defined in Section 5.1.2.

5.1.1.  <ringDown>

   The <ringDown> element is used to request a local 'ringdown' alert at
   the remote party of the private wire.

   The <ringDown> element has the following attributes:



Beauchamp, et al.       Expires January 31, 2014                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      SIP INFO Package for Private Wire          July 2013


   o  signal: conveys an alert on the associated private wire.  Contains
      a single value of 'ring'.  The value 'ring' informs the remote
      client to alert the user based on a locally defined ring cadence
      and duration.  NOTE: There is no signal to signify the end of
      ringing, this is a characteristic to be defined by the remote
      system

   The <ringDown> element has no child elements.

5.1.2.  <hookSwitch>

   The <hookSwitch> element is used to convey a 'hookSwitch' alert to
   the remote party of the private wire.

   The <hookSwitch> element has the following attributes:

   o  signal: conveys the state of the associated private wire.  Values
      can either be 'onHook' or 'offHook'.  The value 'onHook' to signal
      'not in use' on a private wire.  The value 'offHook' to signal 'in
      use' on a private wire.

   The <hookSwitch> element has no child elements.

6.  'pwtype' INFO Package Parameter

   The Info package specification allows individual packages to define
   parameters for the 'Recv-Info' and 'Info-Package' header.  This
   document defines one new event package parameter: pw-type.

   A single instance of the 'pw-type' parameter MUST be included with a
   'Recv-Info' header to convey the type of private wire being used for
   the SIP dialog.  The value of 'pw-type' can either be 'ringdown',
   'hookswitch' or 'TOS'.  By specifying a value of 'ringdown' in the
   'pw-type' parameter the <ringDown> element MUST be used from
   Section 9.  By specifying a value of 'hookswitch' in the 'pw-type'
   parameter the <hookSwitch> element MUST be used from Section 9.  By
   specifying 'TOS'(Transmission Only Service) no additional signalling
   is used in complying with this specification (future specifications
   may provide additional functionality).  TOS is normally used for
   interconnecting voice systems that need no signalling and are always
   assumed to be connected.  An example might be TV audio or a Hoot
   line.  This type of circuit is normally internal to an organisation
   to interconnect groups both globally and regionally.  In future,
   newer Private Wire networks will be able to offer this type of
   service between organisations.  Once the 'pw-type' parameter is set
   in the initial INVITE request it MUST not be changed for the duration
   of the SIP INVITE dialog.  An entity receiving a request with a 'pw-
   type' parameter that is not supported MUST respond with a SIP 4XX

Internet-Draft      SIP INFO Package for Private Wire          July 2013


   response.  An entity receiving a reliable SIP response that contains
   a 'pw-type' parameter that is not supported MUST terminate the SIP
   dialog as immediately as per RFC 3261 [RFC3261].  An entity receiving
   a SIP INFO message containing an incorrect element associated with
   the 'pw-type' MUST respond with a SIP 4XX response and ensure the
   associated SIP INVITE dialog is terminated.

   The ABNF for the 'pw-type' parameter is shown below.

   pw-type    =  "pw-type" EQUAL pwtype
   pwtype   =  "ringdown" / "hookswitch" / "TOS"

                                 Figure 3

7.  SIP OPTIONS Tag

   The Info package specification allows individual packages to define a
   SIP OPTIONS tag to enable discovery of support for this
   specification.

   SIP entities generating an offer or answer that uses the Private Wire
   INFO package MUST place the 'pw-info-package' option-tag in a SIP
   Supported header field.  When responding to, or generating a SIP
   OPTIONS request a SIP entity MUST include the 'pw-info-package' in a
   SIP Supported header field.  SIP entities that support the Private
   Wire INFO package MUST understand the 'pw-info-package' option-tag.

8.  Example Exchange

   The following example provides a simple exchange between a Network

                                 Figure 4

   The example in this section represents an interaction between a
   Network Gateway (NWG) and a SIP enabled Trading desk.  The remainder
   of this section provides more detail relating to Figure 4.  Some
   detail has been left out for simplicity.

   The NWG sends an initial INVITE (1) request.  The INVITE request
   indicates that it is willing to receive SIP INFO requests for the
   Private Wire package.

      INVITE sip:pw@example.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/TCP pc1.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK1
      Max-Forwards: 70
      To: PW <sip:pw@example.com>
      From: Bank <sip:bank@example.com>;tag=100
      Call-ID: abcd1234@pc1.example.com
      CSeq: 1 INVITE
      Supported: pw-info-package
      Recv-Info: pw-info-package;pw-type=hookswitch
      Contact: <sip:bank@pc1.example.com>
      Content-Type: application/sdp
      Content-Length: ...

      ...



   The Trading Desk responds with a 200 OK(2) response.  The 200 OK
   response indicates that it is willing to receive SIP INFO requests
   for the Private Wire package.

     SIP/2.0 200 OK
     Via: SIP/2.0/TCP pc1.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK1;received=192.0.2.1

10.  Legacy Interoperation

   The existing install base of PW are made up of E1/T1 CAS or analogue
   circuits and in order to interoperate with the legacy equipment a
   gateway function is required.  There are a number of different
   signalling types in use and it will be the job of the gateway to map
   the legacy signalling to the proposed SIP INFO messages.

   A number of gateways that exist have solved this problem using RFC
   2833 [RFC2833] which allows call events on trunks to be sent in the
   media plane as RTP packets.  Gateway devices or Session Border
   Controller (SBC) devices implementing this new SIP based signalling
   should to be able to inter operate with this standard and to be able
   to translate between the two worlds.

12.2.  pw-info-package SIP OPTIONS tag

   This section defines a new SIP option tag per the guidelines in
   Section 27.1 of RFC 3261 [RFC3261].

      Name:  pw-info-package

      Description:  This option tag is used to identify the Private
         Wire INFO package extension.  When present in a
         Require header field, it indicates that Private Wire is
         required by a receiving client.
