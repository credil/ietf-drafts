1.  Introduction

   This document discusses some tests and the test results on the
   performance of recursive DNS.  Firstly, tests on plain recursive DNS
   is done.  Secondly, tests on recursive DNS with sortlist enabled is
   done.  Finally, tests on recursive DNS with DNSSec enabled is done.

   Section 2 describes the test environment.  Section 3 lists the test
   result with some analysis.  Section 4 gives some suggestions.

                      Figure 1: topology of the test

2.1.  Topology

   The test simulated a complete recursive request-response procedure in
   a closed network, there are four servers needed at least: one
   recursive server and three Authoritative servers.  As Figure 1
   describes, there are four servers in the topology, implementing the
   recursive server role, the root server role, the .com top level
   domain server role and the xxx.com domain server role.  The xxx.com
   domain server is responsible for resolving the DNS requests from
   1.com to 60000.com.  Besides the four servers, there are also a
   switch and a request generator in the topology.  The requests
   generator simulated many clients with different ip addresses.  It can
   also generate requests as configured and send them to the switch
   which acts as a gateway to transfer requests and responses between
   the recursive server and the clients.

2.2.  Hardware and Hardware

   All the servers concluded in the test are assembled with 2 CPUs with
   8 core in each other and 8GB RAM.  All the network interfaces between
   the server and the switch are 100/1000Base-T so that time between
   each request and response will be less than 4ms.

   All the servers in the test are installed with BIND as DNS software
   and configured as the correct roles as mentioned, the version of
   which is BIND 9.8.1-p1.  As Figure 1 describes, there are 60000 zones
   (1.com~60000.com), each of which is made of a SOA record, a A record
   and a NS record, configured in the xxx.com domain name server.  All
   the zones are divided into two parts: the cache and recursive.  The
   Time-to-live value of each record of the cache part will be 86400 so
   that the record will be alive all the time in the cache of the
   recursive server until the test is over, while the value of the
   recursive part will be just 1 so that the record will be moved out
   from the cache in a second.  At last, the cache size of the recursive
   server is configured to 10MB, which can accomodate all the cache
   part.

2.3.  Data Model

   The statistics and research works on DNS in the network of China
   Mobile suggests that there should be about 75%~80% DNS requests
   received by the recursive server will hit the cache per second.
   Therefore, there are two data models in the test based on the bottom
   line and the upper line above.  As described above, TTL is used to
   simulate two data model.  Each model consists of two parts: the cache
   part and the recursive part.  As Figure 1 shows, the cache part was
   made of the requests that will hit the cache of the recursive DNS,
   while the recursive part was made of the requests that will lead to a
   three time recursive query between the recursive server and all the
   other three authoritative servers.


3.  Analysis of test results

   The test results are listed in table 1 and table 2.  According to the
   test results, when shooting average in the cache of recursive DNS
   reaches 80%, the performance of plain recursive DNS can reach 19800
   QPS.  The performance of recursive DNS with sortlist enabled can
   reach 19300 QPS, which is similar with plain recursive DNS.  However,
   performance of recursive DNS with DNSSec enabled can only reach 9800
   QPS.

   Similarly, when shooting average in the cache of recursive DNS
   reaches 75%, the performance of the plain recursive DNS can reach

   18000 QPS.  The performance of recursive DNS with sortlist enabled
   can reach 17400 QPS, which is similar with plain recursive DNS.
   However, performance of recursive DNS with DNSSec enabled can only
   reach 8200 QPS.

   According to the test results, it is very clear that no matter
   special strategy is enabled or not, the performance of recursive DNS
   almost gets no influence.  However, if DNSSec is enabled, the
   performance of recursive DNS will be greatly influenced, which can be
   cut in half or more.  The reason of that is mainly because of the
   three time validation between the recursive server and all the other
   three authoritative servers.

4.  Suggestion

   More attention should be paid on the performance of recursive DNS
   when DNSSec is enabled.

   More test on this subject will be done subsequently.
