     Intermediate RREP for dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) Routing
                         draft-perkins-irrep-02

Abstract

   The Dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) routing protocol is intended for
   use by mobile routers in wireless, multihop networks.  AODVv2
   determines unicast routes among AODVv2 routers within the network in
   an on-demand fashion, offering on-demand convergence in dynamic
   topologies.  This document specifies an extension to AODVv2 (and
   possibly other reactive routing protocols) enabling intermediate
   nodes to shorten route discovery times.

Internet-Draft              Intermediate RREP              November 2012


1.  Overview

   The Dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) routing protocol enables on-
   demand, multihop unicast routing among participating AODVv2 routers.
   The basic operations of the AODVv2 protocol are route discovery and
   route maintenance.  Route discovery is performed by an AODVv2 router
   when one of its clients transmits a packet towards a destination for
   which the router does not have a route.

   During route discovery, the originator's AODVv2 router (i.e.,
   OrigRtr) initiates flooding of a Route Request (RREQ) throughout the
   network to find a route to a particular destination, via the AODVv2
   router (i.e., TargRtr) responsible for that destination.  During this
   hop-by-hop flooding process, each intermediate AODVv2 router records
   a route to the originator (i.e., OrigNode).  If an intermediate
   router has a route to the destination requested (i.e., TargNode) in
   the RREQ, it may (by following the specification in this document)
   supply that routing information to the originator of the RREQ.  Such
   an RREP message is termed an "Intermediate RREP" (iRREP).  The
   Intermediate router (i.e., InterRtr) also forwards another RREP
   message, termed an "Unsolicited RREP" (uRREP), to the requested
   destination.  The Unsolicited RREP supplies TargRtr and other
   intermediate routers with a route towards OrigNode.  When OrigRtr
   receives the iRREP, and TargRtr receives the uRREP, a bi-directional
   route is established between OrigRtr and TargRtr.

   In this document, RREQ always refers to the incoming RREQ message
   received by InterRtr.  OrigRtr, OrigNode, TargRtr, and TargNode
   always refer to the nodes as defined in [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo]; they
   are named from the context of the AODVv2 router originating the RREQ
   message (OrigRtr).

   Intermediate RREQ is particularly effective in conjunction with the
   use of "expanding rings multicast", which is specified as an optional
   feature in [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo].  Together, these two features
   enable a simple "route repair" mechanism.  When a route breaks
   somewhere near the packet source (i.e., Originating Router), OrigRtr
   MAY limit the flooding of a RREQ using expanding rings multicast.
   Then, nearby AODVv2 routers can in many situations use iRREP to
   supply a new route to the desired destination.  Nearness of the
   broken link relative to OrigRtr can be measured by the <msg-hop-
   count> field of the RERR message (if included) indicating that a
   route has broken.

   When InterRtr receives an RREQ, it first uses the information in the
   RREQ to update any relevant route table entries.  Then, if InterRtr
   is able to generate an iRREP to satisfy the RREQ, it uses the up-to-
   date information in its route table to assign proper values to the

   fields of the iRREP (and uRREP).  In this way, message processing for
   the outgoing RREP messages may be viewed as isolated from the message
   processing for the incoming RREQ message.


2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].  Additionally, this document uses some terminology and
   notation from [RFC5444] and [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo], duplicated here
   for convenience.

   AODVv2 Sequence Number (SeqNum)
      An AODVv2 Sequence Number is maintained by each AODVv2 router
      process.  This sequence number is used by other AODVv2 routers to
      identify the temporal order of routing information generated and
      ensure loop-free routes.

   Intermediate Route Reply (iRREP)
      A RREP message that is originated by an AODVv2 router that is not
      TargRtr.

   Intermediate Router (InterRtr)
      An AODVv2 router along a route between OrigRtr and TargRtr that
      itself is not OrigRtr or TargRtr.

   Originating Node (OrigNode)
      The Originating Node is the source of a data packet that its
      AODVv2 router has to deliver.

   Originating Router (OrigRtr)
      The AODVv2 router that provides network connectivity to the
      Originating Node (OrigNode).  OrigRtr creates a AODVv2 control
      message (namely, RREQ) on behalf of OrigNode to discover a route
      to communications endpoints as required by applications running on
      OrigNode.

   Route Reply (RREP)
      A RREP message is used to supply routing information about the
      TargNode to OrigRtr and the intermediate AODVv2 routers between
      them.

   Route Request (RREQ)
      A RREQ message is used to discover a valid route to a particular
      destination address, called the RREQ TargNode.  When an AODVv2
      router processes a RREQ, it acquires routing information on how to

      reach the RREQ OrigNode.

   Router Client
      An AODVv2 router may be configured with a list of other IP
      addresses and networks which correspond to other non-router nodes
      which require the services of the AODVv2 router for route
      discovery and maintenance.  An AODVv2 is always its own client, so
      that the list of client IP addresses is never empty.

   Target Node (TargNode)
      The Target Node is the ultimate destination of a data packet, and
      the node for which a route discovery may be attempted by OrigRtr.

   Target Router (TargRtr)
      TargRtr is the AODVv2 router providing connectivity for TargNode;
      in other words, TargNode is a router client of TargRtr.

   Unsolicited Route Reply (uRREP)
      An unsolicited RREP message is originated by an AODVv2 router, not
      in response to an RREQ message by the uRREP destination. uRREP is
      also sometimes called "Gratuitous RREP".

   Note that Table 1 treats AddrBlk and TLV array values as if indexed
   starting with 1 instead of 0, in contrast to RFC 5444 [RFC5444].


3.  Unknown Prefix Convention

   In this specification, it is possible that one of the two addresses
   in the specified RREP AddrBlks has a known <prefix-length> value, but
   the other address does not.  In such cases, a <prefix-length> value
   block MUST be supplied even though only one <prefix-length> is known.
   Since RFC 5444 requires the <prefix-length>s to be supplied for both
   addresses, in this document any unknown <prefix-length> in an RFC
   5444 AddrBlk MUST be assigned the value of 0.  Such a value for the
   prefix length is not meaningful, and MUST NOT be stored as the prefix

   length in any route table entry.


4.  Intermediate and Unsolicited RREP

   If an intermediate AODVv2 router (InterRtr) has a Route that can
   satisfy an incoming RREQ, it MAY respond with an Intermediate RREP
   (iRREP).  As usual with any incoming RteMsg, InterRtr first updates
   its route table using the information contained in the RREQ.  For
   instance, a route to OrigNode may be created.  After the incoming
   route update information is applied, InterRtr has valid routes to
   both RREQ.OrigNode and RREQ.TargNode (namely, Route[OrigNode] and
   Route[TargNode] respectively).

   InterRtr SHOULD also issue a RREP to the RREQ TargNode, so that the
   RREQ TargNode receives routing information on how to reach the RREQ
   OrigNode.  This RREP sent towards the RREQ TargNode is known as an
   "Unsolicited RREP" (uRREP).  Each AODVv2 router between InterRtr and
   TargRtr that receives the uRREP, uses the uRREP information to update
   their route table entry for OrigNode.  The uRREP is constructed as if
   it had been transmitted in response to a route discovery initiated by
   TargRtr to discover a route for OrigNode.

   The following conditions must be satisfied before the intermediate
   router (InterRtr) can transmit iRREP and uRREP.

   o  InterRtr is not TargRtr

   o  RREQ does not contain the DestOnly message TLV

   o  InterRtr has a valid route for TargNode, namely Route[TargNode]

   o  Route[TargNode].SeqNum >= RREQ.SeqNumTLV[TargNode] (using signed
      16-bit arithmetic)

4.1.  Intermediate RREP Generation

   The fields of the iRREP are assigned as follows.

   o  IP.DestinationAddr := Route[OrigNode].NextHop

   o  iRREP.HopLimit := Route[OrigNode].HopCount

   o  iRREP.AddrBlk[OrigNode] := Route[OrigNode].Addr

   o  iRREP.AddrBlk[TargNode] := Route[TargNode].Addr

   o  iRREP.SeqNumTLV[OrigNode] := Route[OrigNode].SeqNum

   o  iRREP.SeqNumTLV[TargNode] := Route[TargNode].Seqnum

   o  iRREP.HopCountTLV[TargNode] := Route[TargNode].HopCount

   o  If Route[TargNode].PfxLen is equal to 0, or the number of bits in
      the addresses of the RREQ (32 for IPv4, 128 for IPv6), then no
      <prefix-length> is included with the iRREP.  Otherwise,

      *  iRREP.PfxLen[TargNode] := Route[TargNode].PfxLen

      *  iRREP.PfxLen[OrigNode] := 0

   o  iRREP.VALIDITY_TIME[TargNode] :=
      (ACTIVE_INTERVAL+MAX_IDLETIME) - (Current_Time-Route.LastUsed)

   No prefix length is needed for OrigNode, but due to RFC 5444 format
   requirements, RREP.PfxLen[OrigNode] must be included if
   RREP.PfxLen[TargNode] is included.  In that case,
   RREP.PfxLen[OrigNode] = 0.  Therefore either 0 or two <prefix-length>
   values are included with iRREP.AddrBlk.  The VALIDITY_TIME TLV has
   exactly one (1) element, which is the remaining time before the route
   to TargNode expires.  Since the route is a valid route, this is a
   positive number.

4.2.  Unsolicited RREP Generation

   Since the uRREP is intended to fulfill the function of an RREP
   response to an fictional RREQ message for discovering a route to
   OrigNode, the order of the addresses in the uRREP AddrBlk has to be
   reversed.  In other words, RREQ.OrigNode has to be the IP address in
   the "TargNode" slot of the uRREP, and would have been the "TargNode"
   in the fictional RREQ message to which the uRREP is fictionally
   responding.  To reduce confusion, the IP address in the "OrigNode"
   AddrBlk slot of the uRREP is denoted "uOrigNode", and it has the same
   value as the IP address of the TargNode of the incoming RREQ.
   Similarly, the IP address in the "TargNode" AddrBlk slot of the uRREP
   is denoted "uTargNode", and it has the same value as the IP address
   of the OrigNode of the incoming RREQ.

   The fields of the uRREP are assigned as follows.

   o  IP.DestinationAddr := Route[TargNode].NextHop

   o  uRREP.HopLimit := Route[TargNode].HopCount

   o  uRREP.AddrBlk[uOrigNode] := Route[TargNode].Addr

   o  uRREP.AddrBlk[uTargNode] := Route[OrigNode].Addr

   o  uRREP.SeqNumTLV[uTargNode] := Route[OrigNode].SeqNum

   o  uRREP.HopCountTLV[uTargNode] := Route[OrigNode].HopCount

   o  If Route[OrigNode].PfxLen is equal to 0, or the number of bits in
      the addresses of the RREQ (32 for IPv4, 128 for IPv6), then no
      <prefix-length> is included with the uRREP AddrBlk.  Otherwise,

      *  uRREP.PfxLen[uTargNode] := Route[OrigNode].PfxLen.

      *  uRREP.PfxLen[uOrigNode] := 0.

   No prefix length is needed for uOrigNode == RREQ.TargNode, but due to
   RFC 5444 format requirements, uRREP.PfxLen[uOrigNode] must be
   included if uRREP.PfxLen[uTargNode] is included.  In that case,
   uRREP.PfxLen[uOrigNode] = 0.  Therefore either 0 or two <prefix-
   length> values are included with uRREP.AddrBlk.

6.  Security Considerations

   If AODVv2 RREP messages are not secured, then the threats are the
   same.  Otherwise, the ability of intermediate routers to issue RREP
   on behalf of a destination node changes the security vulnerability of
   the MANET.  To improve security, then Intermediate Routers as well as
   RREQ.OrigNode and RREQ.TargNode need to maintain security
   associations with their neighbors in the MANET in order to verify
   iRREP and uRREP.  Doing this depends on the exact nature of the
   method by which the control messages are made secure, and is beyond
   the scope of this document.
