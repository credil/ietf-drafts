Internet-Draft             Contents Transition              October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The global IPv4 address depletion becomes a reality.  Although the
   IPv4 to IPv6 transition is considered inevitable, deployments of IPv6
   are still quite limited as this document is written.  Facing the
   pressure of IPv4 address shortage, the operators may like to provide
   services through IPv6 in some ways.  However, compared to the
   readiness of operators' infrastructures, the IPv6 transition on the
   content provider and end user sides moves even more slowly.  The lack
   of IPv6-reachable contents becomes one of the main obstacles.

   This document describes several deployment models for the transition
   of IPv4 services to IPv6 based on the approaches specified by IETF
   (e.g., NAT64 [RFC6146], Dual-Stack [RFC4213], IVI [RFC6219], etc.),
   targeting different use cases or conditions.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Motivations

   There have been statements from several popular content providers
   that they have turned on IPv6 (no matter by which means), which do
   have a beneficial effect on encouraging end users' transition to
   IPv6.  Given the operational cost, it is difficult to convince much
   more content providers (especially the great many ones of small-to-
   medium size) to immediately make their publically-facing services
   accessible through both IPv4 and IPv6 natively.  While from the
   users' perspective, the IPv6 reachability of resources required for
   their daily lives is one of the foremost concerns when making the
   decision on whether or not to access Internet using IPv6.  It is a
   chicken or egg dilemma, but the two perspectives are interdependent.
   If the transition of one side passes the point of inflexion, the
   other side will be speeded up after.  So, more efforts are needed to
   encourage the IPv6 adoption and reach the point.  On the other hand,
   the guarantee of IPv4 service offering continuity must be always
   taken into account under any conditions.

3.1.  Transition As A Service

   The deployment models described in this document can be regarded as
   transition services offered by the operators, to small-to-medium size
   content providers (e.g. , those who rent servers from the operators).



Sun, et al.                Expires May 1, 2012                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition              October 2011


   The content providers can take different approaches according to
   their scenarios and business strategies.  For the conservative ones,
   the IPv4 services can be still offered natively, and the IPv6
   services can be offered by the stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation
   [RFC6146].  While for progressive ones and newly incomers, the
   stateless IVI [RFC6219], [RFC6052] can be employed to offer native
   IPv6 services reachable via IPv4.


4.  Deployment Model

   The NAT64 gateway is deployed between the IPv6 Internet and the IPv4
   servers[RFC6144], as shown in the figure below.

           |    +--------+  |
           |                |
           +----------------+

   Figure 1: Overall Deployment Model

   In this deployment model, the NAT64 gateway is deployed in server-
   side, translating IPv6 packets to IPv4 and vice versa.  It is a
   shared platform which can serve multiple IPv4/IPv6 servers in one
   Data Center.  The guidance in
   [RFC6146],[RFC6052],[RFC6144],[RFC6145],[RFC6146] and [RFC6052]
   should be followed.  However, since NAT64 is now deployed in server-
   side, some special considerations should be taken into considerations
   (discussed in Section 5, and 6).

   For communications initiated from the IPv6 side to an IPv4 server, a
   stateful NAT64 would be needed to perform IPv6-to-IPv4 translation.
   Notice that the server-side deployment is independent of the client-
   side deployment, which encourages that IPv6 traffic should be
   preferred from the beginning when IPv6 users are available.  So, IPv6
   traffic will be routed to the NAT64 gateway even when NAT444/DS-Lite
   is deployed in client-side.

   For communications initiated from the IPv4 side to an IPv6 server , a

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition              October 2011


   stateless IVI can be performed with 1:1 mapping.  In both situations,
   A/AAAA addresses can be added directly in DNS authoritative servers
   in advance, which is the most straightforward way to deploy.


5.  IPv6-to-IPv4 communication scenario

   In this scenario, the IPv6 node will firstly get A/AAAA records of
   the content server from DNS, and then the communication will follow
   the path to NAT64 Gateway.  When an IPv6 packet arrives at NAT64
   Gateway, a lookup of the mapping table will be carried out to get the
   IPv4 address used for the translation.  If there is no one matched, a
   new entry will be created.

   When deploying stateful NAT64 in server side, special considerations
   should be taken into with regard to address mapping, DNS
   implementation, Fragmentation, logging, geographically aware
   services, and ALG issues.

5.1.  Mapping and Addressing

   The Stateful NAT64 can be operated in either of the two mapping
   modes:

   o  1:1, one IPv6 address is mapped to one IPv4 address (exclusively
      for given lifetime);

   o  N:1, each of the IPv4 addresses (i.e.  IPv4 address pool) will be
      shared by multiple IPv6 users from Internet.

   To save global IPv4 addresses which has become scarce resource ,
   private blocks, for instance 10.0.0.0/8 may be used for the Stateful
   NAT64.  This private address block can only be seen within the IDC in
   question.  In addition, an IPv6 prefix is needed to represent the
   IPv4 server, and the route of the prefix should be advertised to the
   IPv6 Internet.  The IPv4 address of the server can be embedded in the
   IPv6 prefix following the algorithm specified in [RFC6052].

   Considering the scale of traffic in the foreseeable future, the 1:1
   Mapping Mode with private blocks (one IPv6 address mapped to one
   private IPv4 address within 10.0.0.0/8) is selected for the Stateful
   NAT64.  By this mean, the efficiency of stateful operations could be
   improved and the problems introduced by the address sharing could be
   alleviated (for example, the burden of logging will be reduced in
   this mode).

   However, there may be conflicts if the same private space is used
   internally for the interconnection of servers (e.g. multiple servers



Sun, et al.                Expires May 1, 2012                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition              October 2011


   for load balancing).  In this case, N:1 mode with public blocks can
   be used.  In order to reduce state management burden in N:1 stateful
   NAT64 gateway as well as logging system, a bulk of ports can be
   allocated for each subscriber.

   Additionally, an IPv6 prefix from the Service Provider's space is
   assigned to represent the servers and form the IPv4-translated AAAA
   records.

5.2.  DNS

   To make sure the addresses of servers can be retrieved by IPv6 users
   before initiating sessions, the AAAA records which formed through
   IPv4-translated addresses should be added directly on the domain's
   authoritative DNS, or upgrade authoritative DNS to support DNS64.  In
   this way, the AAAA records under one domain name could be retrieved
   by IPv6 users around the world.

   Please note that if the authoritative DNS of given Content Providers'
   domain names are maintained by some third-party DNS Providers but not
   by themselves or the operator from whom this transition service (i.e.
   the deployment model of Stateful NAT64 discussed herein) is
   purchased, the Content Providers must make sure the authoritative
   AAAA records can be added.

5.3.  Fragmentation

   Basically, the processing of packets carrying fragments follows the
   guidance specified in [RFC6145] and [RFC6146] with exceptions that
   fragmented IPv4/IPv6 packets will be firstly reassembled to an
   integrated packet before doing packet translation and so on.

5.4.  Logging

   The logging is essential for tracing back specific users in stateful
   NAT64.  In 1:1 mode, only per-user logging events need to be recorded
   as {IPv6 address, IPv4 address, timestamp}.  However, for N:1 mode,
   it is recommended that subscriber-based logging with port range
   should be adopted, e.g. {IPv4 address, IPv6 address, port range,
   timestamp}.

5.5.  Geographically aware services

   Since converted IPv4 address would not represent any geographical
   feature anymore, applications that assume such geographic information
   may not work as intended.

   One possible solution is to maintain the above logging information in



Sun, et al.                Expires May 1, 2012                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition              October 2011


   geographic server as well, and offer an open API to Content Providers
   to retrieve its original IPv6 address when necessary.  Another
   possibility the application could rely on location information such
   as GPS co-ordination to identify the user's location, which is
   commonly used in mobile deployment.

5.6.  ALG issues

   Since the types of applications are relatively limited due to the
   deployment policy, it would be easier to solve the ALG issue compared
   to client-side deployment.  For example, Web-based content providers
   might be introduced in the first stage, and so specific ALGs can be
   applied according.  Note that the connections may fail in case of
   IPv4 address literals.  Refer to
   [I-D.wing-behave-http-ip-address-literals] for more details.


6.  IPv4-to-IPv6 communication scenario

   In this scenario, the IPv4 node will firstly get A/AAAA records of
   the server from DNS, and then the communication will follow the path
   to NAT64 Gateway.  When an IPv4 packet arrives at NAT64 Gateway, it
   would be translated to an IPv6 packet based on stateless 1:1 mapping
   algorithm [RFC6219].

6.1.  Mapping and Addressing

   In stateless IVI, IPv6-only server should be configured with an IPv4-
   translatable address.  Then, both source address and destination
   address are applied with 1:1 mapping to keep the simplicity and
   transparency.

6.2.  DNS

   To make sure that addresses of servers can be retrieved by IPv4 users
   before initiating sessions, the A records which are extracted from
   IPv4-translated addresses should be added directly on the domain's
   authoritative DNS, or upgrade authoritative DNS to support DNS64.
   Other considerations are actually the same with Section 3.

6.3.  Logging

   There is no logging issue in stateless IVI translation.

6.4.  Geographically aware services

   When a content provider gets an IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses with a
   pre-defined Prefix, it should extract the embedded IPv4 address which

Internet-Draft             Contents Transition              October 2011


   would reflects its original geographical information.

6.5.  ALG issues

   ALG issues would be the same with section 5.6.


7.  CDN considerations

   Currently, content delivery networks have widely deployed address-
   based scheduling policy for load balancing, server selection, etc.,
   and address-embedded URL would be carried in HTTP payload directly.
   This would have great impact on a great many applications (as
   indicated in Appendix experimental result).  Thus, the scheduler may
   need to integrate with NAT64 module to reply IPv4-translatable IPv6
   addresses in HTTP payload, when receiving IPv4 requests from
   translated source address within a configured NAT64 IPv4 address
   pool.

   However, when Content Service Providers only supports IPv6 at some of
   their POPs, the situation would be complicated.  In this case, the
   scheduler needs to determine the network environment of different
   POPs and then return IPv4-translatable IPv6 address when necessary.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   The security issues and considerations discussed in [RFC6146] apply
   to the deployment model described in this document.  However, when
   deploying stateful NAT64 in server side, it is hard to apply source-
   based filtering policy.  As a result, additional mechanisms such as
   system alarming to report state-consuming status and speed will to be
   introduced as well.

   See below for some sites that have migrated through the approach
   aforementioned, and are IPv6 accessible:

   Up to now, there are more than 15 thousands different IPv6 users ever
   accessing the above six Content Providers through the NAT64 box
   totally, with 6000 to 7000 active users every day. "www.voc.com.cn"
   is the most popular one accessed by more than 4000 IPv6 users daily,
   and www.chinatelecom.com.cn (the official website of china telecom)
   has amounts of access from 1200 IPv6 users on average every day.

   The IPv6 users aforementioned are located worldwide.  More than 91
   percent come from CERNET2, and the rest are from China telecom, USA,
   Australia, Finland, etc.  The total percentage of 6to4 users accounts
   for approximately 3.2%.

1.2.  Test results for TOP 100 Websites in China

   We have tested TOP 100 websites in China with stateful NAT64, in
   which both dual-stack and IPv6-only access scenarios have been
   included.  Our major objective is to verify the ALG issues in popular
   websites.

           |    +--------+  |     +---------+ /   +--------------+
           |    |  IPv4  |  |     |  NAT64  |/
           |    | Server +--+-----+ Gateway |\    +--------------+
           |    +--------+  |     +---------+ \   |     IPv4     |
           |                |                  +--+   Network    |
           |                |                     +--------------+
           +----------------+

   The test results have shown that there is no service brokenness in
   dual-stack access environment, and IPv6 transmission would be
   preferred in non-ALG case.  However, for IPv6-only users, we have
   found an interesting phenomena: 90 percentage of comprehensive
   websites(like sina, 163.com, etc) would not have IPv4 address literal
   problem for their video service, while more than 90% of video
   websites (like youku, tudou, etc) do have ALG problem which embedding
   IPv4 address directly.  It is mainly because video websites have
   rented CDN servers from third-party CSPs providers, who make use of
   address-based scheduling policy as in section 7.  It is important to
   solve the CDN problem in IPv6 transition.
