    <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The deployments of various wireless access techniques are being combined with
      the use of video and other applications which rely upon IP Multicast. Wireless and mobile 
      multicast are attracting increasing interest from content and service providers. Multicast faces 
      challenges with dynamic group membership management being under the constant update of
      delivery paths introduced by node movement. There is a high probability of loss
      and congestion due to limited reliability and capacity of wireless links.</t>

      <t>Multicast networks are generally constructed by the IGMP and MLD group
      management protocols (respectively for IPv4 and IPv6 networks) to track
      valid receivers and by multicast routing protocol building multicast
      delivery paths. This document focuses only on IGMP and MLD, the
      protocols used by a host to subscribe to a multicast group and the protocols that are most likely to
      be exposed to wireless links when supporting terminal mobility. As IGMP and
      MLD were designed for fixed users on a wired link, they do not
      necessarily work well for different wireless link types and mobile
      scenarios. IGMP/MLD should be enhanced to be more
      applicable in these mobile/wireless environments.</t>

      <t>This memo proposes a variety of optimizations for IGMP and MLD, in
      wireless and mobile networks, to improve network performance, with
      minimum changes on the protocol behavior and without introducing
      interoperability issues. These solutions can also be applied in wired
      networks when efficiency or reliability is required.</t>

      <t>For generality, this memo does not put limitations on the type of
      wireless techniques running below IGMP or MLD. They could be cellular,
      WiMAX, WiFi and etc, and are modeled as different abstract link models
      as described in section 2.2. Even though some of them (such as WiFi)
      have multicast limitations, it is probable that IGMP/MLD is enabled on
      the wireless terminal and multicast is supported across the network. The
      mobile IP protocol adopted on the core side, upstream from the access
      router, could be PMIP, MIPv4, or MIPv6.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <section title="Characteristics of Wireless and Mobile Multicast">
        <t>Several limitations should be considered when supporting IP
        multicast in wireless and mobile networks, including:</t>

        <t>O Limited link bandwidth: wireless links usually have limited
        bandwidth, and the situation will be made even worse if a high volume of
        video multicast data has to be carried. Additionally, the bandwidth available
        in the upstream and downstream directions may be asymmetrical.</t>

        <t>O High loss rate: wireless links usually have packet loss ranging
        from 1% to 30% according to different links types and conditions. Also
        when packets have to travel between home and access networks (e.g.
        through a tunnel), they are prone to loss if the two networks are
        distant from each other.</t>

        <t>O Frequent membership change: in fixed multicast, membership change
        only happens when a user leaves or joins a group, while in mobile
        scenario membership may also change when a user changes its
        location.</t>

        <t>O Prone to performance degradation: the possible increased
        interaction of protocols across layers for mobility management, and
        the limitation of link capacity, may lead to network performance
        degradation and even to complete connection loss.</t>

        <t>O Increased Leave Latency: the leave latency in mobile multicast
        might be increased due to user movement, especially if the traffic has
        to be transmitted between access and home networks, or if there is a
        handshake between networks.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Wireless Link Model">
        <t>Wireless links can typically be categorized into three models: point-to-point (PTP), point-to-
        multipoint (PTMP), and broadcast link models.</t>

        <t>In the PTP model, one link is dedicated for two communication
        facilities. For multicast transmission, each PTP link normally has
        only one receiver and the bandwidth is dedicated for that receiver.
        Such link model may be implemented by running PPP on the link or
        having separate VLAN assignment for each receiver. In a mobile network,
        a tunnel between entities of home and foreign networks should be
        recognized as a PTP link.</t>

        <t>PTMP is the model for multipoint transmission wherein there is one
        centralized transmitter and multiple distributed receivers. PTMP
        provides common downlink channels for all receivers and dedicated
        uplink channel for each receiver. Bandwidth downstream is shared by
        all receivers on the same link.</t>

        <t>Broadcast links can connect two or more nodes and support broadcast
        transmissions. It is quite similar to fixed Ethernet link model and its
        link resource is shared in both uplink and downlink directions.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Requirements on IGMP and MLD">
        <t>IGMP and MLD are usually run between mobile or wireless terminals
        and their first-hop access routers (i.e. home or foreign routers) to
        subscribe to a IP multicast channel. Currently the version in-use
        includes IGMPv2 [RFC2236] and its IPv6 counterpart MLDv1 [RFC2710],
        IGMPv3 [RFC3376] and its IPv6 counterpart MLDv2 [RFC3810], and LW-
        IGMPv3/MLDv2 [RFC5790]. All these versions have basic group management
        capability required by a multicast subscription. The differences lie
        in that IGMPv2 and MLDv1 can only join and leave a non-source-specific
        group, while IGMPv3 and MLDv2 can select including and excluding
        specific sources for their join and leave operation, and
        LW-IGMPv3/MLDv2 simplifies IGMPv3/MLDv2 procedures by discarding
        excluding-source function. Among these versions, (LW-) IGMPv3/MLDv2
        has the capability of explicitly tracking each host member.</t>

        <t>From the illustration given in section 2.1 and 2.2, it is desirable
        for IGMP and MLD to have the following characteristics when used in
        wireless and mobile networks:</t>

        <t>o Adaptive to link conditions: wireless networks have various link
        types, each with different bandwidth and performance features. IGMP or
        MLD should be able to be adaptive to different link models and link
        conditions to optimize its protocol operation.</t>

        <t>o Minimal group join/leave latency: because mobility and handover
        may cause a user to join and leave a multicast group frequently, fast
        join and leave by the user helps to accelerate service activation and
        to release unnecessary resources quickly to optimize resource
        utilization.</t>

        <t>o Robust to packet loss: the unreliable packet transmission due to
        instable wireless link conditions and limited bandwidth, or long
        distance transmission in mobile network put more strict robustness
        requirement on delivery of IGMP and MLD protocol messages.</t>

        <t>o Reducing packet exchange: wireless link resources are usually
        more limited, precious, and congested compared to their wired
        counterpart. This requires packet exchange be minimized without
        degrading protocol performance.</t>

        <t>o Packet burst avoidance: large number of packets generated in a
        short time interval may have the tendency to deteriorate wireless
        network conditions. IGMP and MLD should be optimized to reduce the
        probability of packet burst.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="IGMP/MLD Optimization for Wireless and Mobile Networks">
      <t>This section introduces several optimizations for IGMP and MLD
      in wireless or mobile environment. The aim is to meet the requirements
      described in section 2.3. It should be noted that because an enhancement
      in one direction might result in weakening effect in another, balances
      should be taken cautiously to realize overall performance elevation.</t>

      <section title="Switching Between Unicast and Multicast Queries">
        <t>IGMP/MLD protocols use multicast Queries whose destinations are
        multicast addresses and also allows use of unicast Query with unicast
        destination to be sent only to one host. Unicast Query has the
        advantage of not affecting other hosts on the same link, and is
        desirable for wireless communication because a mobile terminal often
        has limited battery power [RFC6636]. But if the number of valid
        receivers is large, using unicast Query for each receiver is
        inefficient because large number of Unicast Queries have to be
        generated, in which situation normal multicast Query will be a good
        choice because only one General Query is needed. If the number of
        receivers to be queried is small, unicast Query is advantageous over
        the multicast one.</t>

        <t>More flexibly, the router can choose to switch between unicast and
        multicast Queries according to the practical network conditions. For
        example, if the receiver number is small, the router could send
        unicast Queries respectively to each receiver, without arousing other
        non-member terminal which is in dormant state. When the receiver
        number reaches a predefined level, the router could change to use
        multicast Queries. To have the knowledge of the number of the valid
        receivers, a router is required to enable explicit tracking, and
        because Group-Specific Query and Group-and-Source-Specific Query are
        usually not used under explicit tracking [RFC6636], the switching
        operation mostly applies to General Queries.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="General Query Supplemented with Unicast Query">
        <t>The Unicast Query can be used in assistance to General Query to
        improve the robustness of solicited reports when General Query fails
        to collect all of its valid members. It requires the explicit tracking
        to be enabled and can be used when a router after sending a periodical
        General Query collects successfully most of the valid members'
        responses while losing some of which are still valid in its database.
        This may be because these reports are not generated or generated but
        lost for some unknown reasons. The router could choose to unicast a
        Query respectively to each non-respondent valid receiver to check
        whether they are still alive for the multicast reception, without
        affecting the majority of receivers that have already responded.
        Unicast Queries under this condition could be sent at the end of the
        [Maximum Response Delay] after posting a General Query, and be
        retransmitted for [Last Member Query Count] times, at an interval of
        [Last Member Query Interval].</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Retransmission of Queries">
        <t>In IGMP and MLD, apart from the continuously periodical
        transmission, General Query is also transmitted during a router's
        startup. It is transmitted for [Startup Query Count] times by [Startup
        Query Interval]. There are some other cases where retransmission of
        General Query is beneficial which are not covered by current IGMP and
        MLD protocols as shown as following.</t>

        <t>For example, a router which keeps track of all its active
        receivers, if after sending a General Query, fails to get any response
        from the receivers which are still valid in its membership database.
        This may be because all the responses of the receivers happen to be
        lost, or the sent Query does not arrive at the other side of the link
        to the receivers. The router could compensate this situation by
        retransmitting the General Query to solicit its active members. The
        retransmission can also be applied to Group-Specific or
        Group-and-Source-Specific Query on a router without explicit tracking
        capability, when these Specific Queries cannot collect valid response,
        to prevent missing valid members caused by lost Queries and
        Reports.</t>

        <t>The above compensating Queries could be sent [Last Member Query
        Count] times, at the interval of [Last Member Query Interval], if the
        router cannot get any feedback from the receivers.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="General Query Suppression">
        <t>In IGMP and MLD, the General Query is sent periodically and
        continuously without any limitation. It helps soliciting the state of
        current valid member but has to be processed by all hosts on the link,
        whether they are valid multicast receivers or not. When there is no
        receiver, the transmission of the General Query is a waste of
        resources for both the host and the router.</t>

        <t>An IGMP/MLD router could suppress its transmission of General Query
        if it knows there is no valid multicast receiver on an interface, e.g.
        in the following cases:</t>

        <t>O When the last member reports its leave for a group. This could be
        judged by an explicit tracking router checking its membership
        database, or by a non-explicit-tracking router getting no response
        after sending Group-Specific or Group-and-Source-Specific Query.</t>

        <t>O When the only member on a PTP link reports its leaving</t>

        <t>O When a router after retransmitting General Queries on startup
        fails to get any response</t>

        <t>O When a router previously has valid members but fails to get any
        response after several rounds of General Queries.</t>

        <t>In these cases the router could make the decision that no member is
        on the interface and totally stop its transmission of periodical
        General Queries. If afterwards any valid member joins a
        group, the router could resume the original cycle of general Querying.
        Because General Query influences all hosts on a link,
        suppressing it when it is not needed is beneficial for both the link
        efficiency and terminal power saving.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Tuning Response Delay According to Link Type and Status  ">
        <t>IGMP and MLD use delayed response to spread unsolicited Reports
        from different hosts to reduce possibility of packet burst. This is
        implemented by a host responding to a Query in a specific time
        randomly chosen between 0 and [Maximum Response Delay], the latter of
        which is determined by the router and is carried in Query messages to
        inform the hosts for calculation of the response delay. A larger value
        will lessen the burst better but will increase leave latency (the time
        taken to cease the traffic flowing after the last member requests the
        escaping of a channel).</t>

        <t>In order to avoid message burst and reduce leave latency, the
        Response Delay may be dynamically calculated based on the expected
        number of responders, and link type and status, as shown in the
        following:</t>

        <t>O If the expected number of reporters is large and link condition
        is bad, longer Maximum Response Delay is recommended; if the expected
        number of reporters is small and the link condition is good, smaller
        Maximum response Delay should be set.</t>

        <t>o If the link type is PTP, the Maximum Response Delay can be chosen
        smaller, whereas if the link is PTMP or broadcast medium, the Maximum
        Response Delay can be configured larger.</t>

        <t>The Maximum Response Delay could be configured by the administrator
        as mentioned above, or be calculated automatically by a software tool
        implemented according to experiential model for different link modes.
        The measures to determine the instant value of Maximum Response Delay
        are out of this document's scope.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Triggering Reports and Queries Quickly During Handover">
        <t>When a mobile terminal is moving from one network to another, if it
        is receiving multicast content, its new access network should try to
        deliver the content to the receiver without disruption or performance
        deterioration. In order to implement smooth handover between networks,
        the terminal's membership should be acquired as quickly as possible by
        the new access network.</t>

        <t>An access router could trigger a Query to a terminal as soon as it
        detects the terminal's attaching on its link. This could be a General
        Query if the number of the entering terminals is not small (e.g when
        they are simultaneously in a moving train). Or this Query could also
        be a unicast Query for this incoming terminal to prevent unnecessary
        action of other terminals in the switching area.</t>

        <t>For the terminal, it could send a report immediately if it is
        currently in the multicast reception state, when it begins to connect
        the new network. This helps establishing more quickly the membership
        state and enable faster multicast stream injection, because with the
        active report the router does not need to wait for the query period to
        acquire the terminal's newest state.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    
        <section anchor="Apply"
             title="Applicability and Interoperability Considerations">
      <t>Among the optimizations listed above, 'Switching between unicast and
      multicast Queries'(3.1) and 'General Query Supplemented with Unicast
      Query'(3.2) requires a router to know beforehand the valid members
      connected through an interface, thus require explicit tracking
      capability. An IGMP/MLD implementation could choose any combination of
      the methods listed from 3.1 to 3.6 to optimize multicast communication
      on a specific wireless or mobile network.</t>

      <t>For example, an explicit-tracking IGMPv3 router, can switch to
      unicast General Queries if the number of members on a link is small
      (3.1), can trigger unicast Query to a previously valid receiver if
      failing to get expected responses from it (3.2), can retransmit a
      General Query if after the previous one cannot collect reports from all
      valid members (3.3), and can stop sending a General Query when the last
      member leaves the group (3.4), and etc.</t>

      <t>For interoperability, it is required if multiple multicast routers
      are connected to the same network for redundancy, each router are
      configured with the same optimization policy to synchronize the
      membership states among the routers.</t>
    </section>
    
   <section title="IGMP/MLD Suspend and Resume">

	  <section title="IGMP/MLD Suspend Request">

	    <t>IGMP/MLD Suspend is an operation triggered by a host that subscribes multicast channels or an IGMP/MLD proxy <xref target="refs.Proxy" /> 
	    to which hosts subscribing multicast channels attached. An IGMP/MLD Suspend message requests an adjacent upstream router to suspend forwarding 
	    subscribed data, while to keep the subscription state (i.e., not to prune the routing path). It is useful especially in a mobile network. When a mobile host 
	    moves from a current network (i.e., a mobile host's point of attachment) to a different network, an IGMP/MLD Suspend message is sent by the host itself 
	    (or an IGMP/MLD proxy to which mobile hosts attached).</t>

<!-- The IGMP/MLD Suspend message will be sent by the mobile host or the proxy depending on which mobile protocol is in use. For instance, in 
MIPv6 <xref target="refs.MIPv6" />, a mobile host detects its own movement and sends the IGMP/MLD Suspend message to its upstream router (or Home Agent).-->

	    <t>When an IGMP/MLD proxy receives IGMP/MLD Suspend messages on its downstream interface, it forwards the Suspend message to its upstream 
	    router via its upstream interface if needed (see <xref target="sec.hold_recept" />.</t>

	  </section>

<!-- ============================================================ -->

	  <section anchor="sec.release_req" title="IGMP/MLD Resume Request">

	    <t>When a host that has subscribed multicast channels and sent IGMP/MLD Suspend messages attaches to a new network, it immediately sends 
	    IGMP/MLD Resume messages to request its upstream router to resume forwarding the data. The Resume Records specified in the IGMP/MLD Resume 
	    message will be the same as that of the Suspend Records the host sent.</t>

	  </section>

<!-- ============================================================ -->

	  <section anchor="sec.hold_recept" title="IGMP/MLD Suspend Reception">

	    <t>When a multicast router receives an IGMP/MLD Suspend message from the downstream member hosts or IGMP/MLD proxy, it examines whether 
	    the message sender is the sole member of the reported channels at the downstream link or not. There are two ways to know it. One is done by the 
	    Group-Specific or Group-and-Source Specific Queries. The other is done by the explicit tracking function <xref target="refs.explicit" />.</t>

	    <t>The router sends the Group-Specific or Group-and-Source Specific Queries for all records in the Suspend messages. If the router receives IGMP/MLD 
	    reports including some or all of the Suspend Records, it eliminates the reported records from the Suspend Records and keeps forwarding these data. If the 
	    router does not receive IGMP/MLD reports for some or all of the Suspend Records, it recognizes that the Suspend message sender is the sole member 
	    host for these channels on the link. After the router organizes the new Suspend Records (that eliminate reported records from the original one), it suspends 
	    data forwarding for them.</t>

	    <t>The explicit tracking function gives advantage of organizing the new Suspended Records. If a router enables the explicit tracking function, it can 
	    recognize whether the message sender host is the sole member without sending the Group-Specific or Group-and-Source Specific Queries. Then the 
	    router suspends data forwarding based on the up-to-date Suspend Records.</t>

	    <t>The multicast router maintains Suspend Records until it receives the corresponding IGMP/MLD Resume message (described in the next section) or 
	    the IGMP/MLD Suspend Interval timer (described in <xref target="sec.value_hold" />) is expired. When either the Resume message reception or the 
	    timer expiration occurs, the router resume data forwarding for the Suspend Records and discards the Suspend Records.</t>

	    <t>If a multicast router receives an IGMP/MLD Suspend message, which includes Multicast Address Records already suspended, the router restarts

	    <t>When an IGMP/MLD proxy receives an IGMP/MLD Suspend message from a downstream host, it behaves as a multicast router as described above, 
	    because the proxy device performs the router portion of the IGMP or MLD protocol on its downstream interfaces.</t>

	    <t>When a mobile node that has sent the IGMP/MLD Suspend message receives the corresponding Group-Specific or Group-and-Source Specific 
	    Queries for the Suspend Records, it replies the standard IGMP/MLD Report messages as defined in <xref target="refs.IGMPv3" /><xref target="refs.MLDv2" />.
<!--(It is necessary because the router may prune if the Suppress sender does not reply, except the case the router tracks member hosts.)-->

	  <section anchor="sec.release_recept" title="IGMP/MLD Resume Reception">

	    <t>When a multicast router receives an IGMP/MLD Resume message, the router examines the message sender and an IGMP/MLD Suspend Interval 
	    timer. If the router has the Suspend Records given from the Resume message sender, it compares the Suspend Records with the notified Multicast 
	    Address Records specified in the Resume message. For the matched Multicast Address Records, the router then removes the entries from the Suspend 
	    Records and resumes data forwarding with restarting the group or source timers. For the mismatched Multicast Address Records, the router keeps 
	    unchanged (then will be removed by timeout) or explicitly starts the leave (or prune) procedures for the channels, while it depends on the implementation.</t>

	    <t> If either the router does not have the corresponding Suspend Records or the IGMP/MLD Suspend Interval timer has expired, then the router does not 
	    take any action.</t>

	    <t>If a router that did not recognize an IGMP/MLD Suspend message (e.g., due to packet loss or some troubles in its transmission) receives an IGMP/MLD 
	    Resume message, it will accept the message as a regular Current-State Report IGMP/MLD message.

<!--	  <t>An IGMP/MLD Notification operation is a simple optimization for mobile hosts to spontaneously send IGMP/MLD Current-State Report to their upstream 
multicast routers. Since a multicast router solicits downstream membership information by IGMP/MLD General Query, non-upgraded mobile hosts can coexist in 
the network. However, join and leave latency for non-upgraded mobile hosts may become longer due to the longer [Query Interval] timer configuration for multicast 
routers. Note that the IGMP/MLD Notification operation does not require any modification to multicast routers.</t>-->

<!--	  <t>If a multicast router does not support an IGMP/MLD Suspend operation, it will ignore the IGMP/MLD Suspend message. In this case, an IGMP/MLD 
Current-State Report message sent by a mobile host that previously requested an IGMP/MLD Suspend operation to stop forwarding data is dealt with as a new 
join request for the specified multicast sessions (when the corresponding group or source timer is expired) or simply updates the corresponding group and/or 
source timer (when these timers are not expired and the membership status has been still active).</t>-->

	    <t>After a multicast router receiving an IGMP/MLD Suspend message will identify the corresponding multicast sessions/channels, it suspends data 
	    forwarding and keeps the Suspend Records until the given amount of timer value is expired. This timer is named the "IGMP/MLD Suspend Interval timer", 
	    which is a configurable value.</t>

	    <t>The Suspend Interval is used to allow a multicast router to resume the multicast session. Therefore, if the multicast router does not receive the 
	    corresponding IGMP/MLD Resume message for the IGMP/MLD Resume operation within the Suspend Interval, it leaves the sessions/channels recorded 
	    in the Suspend Records and discards the Suspend Records. Note that the router does not send any IGMP/MLD Query message for the timeout sessions/channels 
	    and immediately leaves from them.</t>

<!--	    <t>[TODO: We will provide the default Suspend Interval value based on some experimental results in the revised version. Note that this value might be 
dependent on each mobile protocol; hence the value must be able to be adjusted by operators.]</t>-->

      <t>Since the methods only involve the tuning of protocol behavior by
      e.g. retransmission, changing delay parameter, or other compensating
      operations, they do not introduce additional security weaknesses. The
      security consderations described in [RFC2236], [RFC3376], [RFC2710] and
      [RFC3810] can be reused. And to achieve some security level in insecure
      wireless network, it is possible to take stronger security procedures
      during IGMP/MLD message exchange, which are out of the scope of this
