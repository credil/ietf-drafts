Abstract

   GMPLS supports the description of optical switching by identifying
   entries in fixed lists of switchable wavelengths (called grids)
   through the encoding of lambda labels.  Work within the ITU-T Study
   Group 15 has defined a finer granularity grid, and the facility to
   flexibly select different widths of spectrum from the grid.  This
   document defines a new GMPLS lambda label format to support this
   flexi-grid.

   This document updates RFC 3471 and RFC 6205 by introducing a new
   label format.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [RFC3945], GMPLS extends MPLS from supporting only
   Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and switching to also
   support four new classes of interfaces and switching that include
   Lambda Switch Capable (LSC).

   A functional description of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed
   to support this new class of interface and switching is provided in
   [RFC3471].

   [RFC3471] states that wavelength labels "only have significance
   between two neighbors" (Section 3.2.1.1); global wavelength semantics
   are not considered.  [RFC6205] defines a standard lambda label format
   that has a global semantic and which is compliant with both the Dense
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) grid [G.694.1] and the Coarse
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) grid [G.694.2].  The terms
   DWDM and CWDM are defined in [G.671].

   A flexible grid network selects its data channels as arbitrarily
   assigned pieces of the spectrum.  Mixed bitrate transmission systems
   can allocate their channels with different spectral bandwidths so
   that the channels can be optimized for the bandwidth requirements of
   the particular bit rate and modulation scheme of the individual
   channels.  This technique is regarded as a promising way to improve
   the network utilization efficiency and fundamentally reduce the cost
   of the core network.

   The "flexi-grid" has been developed within the ITU-T Study Group 15
   to allow selection and switching of pieces of the optical spectrum
   chosen flexibly from a fine granularity grid of wavelengths with
   variable spectral bandwidth [G.694.1].  This document updates the

   definition of GMPLS lambda labels provided in [RFC6205] to support
   the flexi-grid.

   This document relies on [G.694.1] for the definition of the optical
   data plane and does not make any updates to the work of the ITU-T in
   that regard.  The encoding specified in this document will be
   communicated to the ITU-T for comment before publication as an RFC.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Overview of Flexi-Grid

   [G.694.1] extends DWDM fixed grids as defined in [G.694.1] to add
   support for flexible grids.  The basis of the work is to allow a data
   channel to be formed from an abstract grid anchored at 193.1 THz and
   selected on a channel spacing of 6.25 GHz with a variable slot width
   measured in units of 12.5 GHz.  Individual allocations may be made on
   this basis from anywhere in the spectrum, subject to allocations not
   overlapping.

   [G.694.1] provides clear guidance on the support of flexible grid by
   implementations in Section 2 of Appendix I:

      The flexible DWDM grid defined in clause 7 has a nominal central
      frequency granularity of 6.25 GHz and a slot width granularity of
      12.5 GHz. However, devices or applications that make use of the
      flexible grid may not have to be capable of supporting every
      possible slot width or position. In other words, applications may
      be defined where only a subset of the possible slot widths and
      positions are required to be supported.

      For example, an application could be defined where the nominal
      central frequency granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring
      values of n that are even) and that only requires slot widths as a
      multiple of 25 GHz (by only requiring values of m that are even).

3.  Fixed Grid Lambda Label Encoding

   [RFC6205] defines an encoding for a global semantic for a DWDM label
   based on four fields:

   - Grid: used to select which grid the lambda is selected from.
     Values defined in [RFC6205] identify DWDM [G.694.1] and CWDM
     [G.694.2].

   - C.S. (Channel Spacing): used to indicate the channel spacing.
     [RFC6205] defines values to represent spacing of 100, 50, 25 and
     12.5 GHz.

   - Identifier: a local-scoped integer used to distinguish different
     lasers (in one node) when they can transmit the same frequency
     lambda.

   - n: a two's-complement integer to take either a positive, negative,
     or zero value.  This value is used to compute the frequency as
     defined in [RFC6205] and based on [G.694.1].  The use of n is
     repeated here for ease of reading.

        Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * frequency granularity (THz)

     where the nominal central frequency granularity for the flexible
     grid is 0.00625 THz


4.  Flexi-Label Format and Values

4.1 Flexi-Label Encoding

   This document defines a generalized label encoding for use in flexi-
   grid systems.  As with the other GMPLS lambda label formats defined
   in [RFC3471] and [RFC6205], the use of this label format is known a
   priori.  That is, since the interpretation of all lambda labels is
   determined hop-by-hop, the use of this label format requires that all
   nodes on the path expect to use this label format.

   For convenience, however, the label format is modeled on the fixed
   grid label defined in [RFC6205] and briefly described in Section 3.

   Within the fixed grid network, the C.S. value is used to represent
   the channel spacing, as the spacing between adjacent channels is
   constant.  For the flexible grid situation, this field is used to
   represent the nominal central frequency granularity.

   The meaning of the Identifier field is maintained from [RFC6205] (see
   also Section 3).

   The meaning of n is maintained from [RFC6205] (see also Section 3).

   The m field is used to identify the slot width according to the
   formula given in [G.694.1] as follows:

         Slot Width (GHz) = 12.5 GHz * m

   The Reserved field MUST be set to zero on transmission and SHOULD be
   ignored on receipt.

   An implementation that wishes to use the flexi-grid label encoding
   MUST follow the procedures of [RFC3473] and of [RFC3471] as updated
   by [RFC6205].  It MUST set Grid to 3 and C.S. to 5.  It MUST set
   Identifier to indicate the local identifier of the laser in use as
   described in [RFC6205].  It MUST also set n according to the formula
   in Section 3 (inherited unchanged from [RFC6205]).  Finally, the
   implementation MUST set m as described in the formula stated above.


4.2.  Considerations of Bandwidth

   There is some overlap between the concept of bandwidth and label in
   many GMPLS-based systems where a label indicates a physical switching
   resource.  This overlap is increased in a flexi-grid system where a
   label value indicates the slot width and so affects the bandwidth
   supported by an LSP.  Thus the 'm' parameter is both a property of
   the label (i.e., it helps define exactly what is switched) and of the
   bandwidth.

   In GMPLS signaling [RFC3473], bandwidth is requested in the TSpec
   object and confirmed in the Flowspec object.  The 'm' parameter is a
   parameter of the GMPLS flexi-grid label as described above and is
   also a parameter of the flexi-grid TSpec and Flowspec as described in
   [FLEXRSVP].


5.  Manageability Considerations

   This document introduces no new elements for management.  That is,
   labels can continue to be used in the same way by the GMPLS protocols
   and where those labels were treated as opaque quantities with local
   or global significance, no change is needed to the management
   systems.

   However, this document introduces some changes to the nature of a
   label that may require changes to management systems.  Firstly,
   systems that handle lambda labels as 32 bit quantities need to be
   updated to process the 64 bit labels described in this document even
   if the labels are treated as opaque quantities.  Furthermore,
   although management systems that can handle lambda labels as defined
   in [RFC6205] can continue to process the fields defined in RFC 6205
   as before, they have to handle new legal values of some of those
   fields (Grid = 3 and C.S. = 5), and they have to be aware of the new
   'm' field.

6.  Security Considerations

   [RFC6205] notes that the definition of a new label encoding does not
   introduce any new security considerations to [RFC3471] and [RFC3473].
   That statement applies equally to this document.

   see the MPLS/GMPLS security framework [RFC5920].


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry that contains several
   subregistries.

7.1.  Grid Subregistry

   IANA is requested to allocate a new entry in this subregistry as

Appendix A.  Flexi-Grid Example

   Consider a fragment of an optical LSP between node A and node B using
   the flexible grid.  Suppose that the LSP on this hop is formed:
   - using the ITU-T Flexi-Grid
   - the nominal central freequency of the slot 193.05 THz
   - the nominal central frequency granularity is 6.25 GHz
   - the slot width is 50 GHz.

   In this case the label representing the switchable quantity that is
   the flexi-grid quantity is encoded as described in Section 4.1 with
   the following parameter settings.  The label can be used in signaling
   or in management protocols to describe the LSP.

     Grid = 3 : ITU-T Flexi-Grid

     C.S. = 5 : 6.25 GHz nominal central frequency granularity

     Identifier = local value indicating the laser in use

     n = -8 :

          Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * frequency granularity (THz)

          193.05 (THz) = 193.1 (THz) + n * 0.00625 (THz)

          n = (193.05-193.1)/0.00625 = -8

     m = 4 :

          Slot Width (GHz) = 12.5 GHz * m

          50 (GHz) = 12.5 (GHz) * m

          m = 50 / 12.5 = 4
