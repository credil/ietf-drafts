              IANA Registries for BGP Extended Communities


                  draft-rosen-idr-extcomm-iana-00.txt

Abstract

   This document reorganizes the IANA Registries for the type values and
   sub-type values of BGP Extended Communities attribute and the BGP
   IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Communities attribute.  This is done
   in order to remove inter-dependencies among the registries, thus
   making it easier for IANA to determine which codepoints are available
   for assignment in which registries.  This document also clarifies the
   information that must be provided to IANA when requesting an
   allocation from one or more of these registries.  These changes are
   compatible with the existing allocations, and thus do not affect
   protocol implementations.  The changes will however impact the "IANA
   Considerations" sections of future protocol specifications.  This
   document updates RFCs 4360 and 5701.

1. Introduction

   RFC 4360 [RFC4360] defines the BGP "Extended Communities" (EC)
   attribute.  This attribute consists of a sequence of eight-octet
   "extended communities".  The high-order octet is defined to be the
   "Type" field.  Each Type has a range of values for "Transitive
   Extended Community Types" and a range of values for "Non-transitive
   Extended Community Types".  Some of these ranges are further sub-
   divided into a sub-range of values to be assigned by IANA under the
   "Standards Action (with Early Allocation)" policy a sub-range of
   values to be assigned by IANA under the "First Come First Served"
   policy, and a sub-range for "experimental use". (See [RFC5226],
   [RFC4020], and [RFC3692] for an explanation of these policies.)

   For some Extended Community Types, the second octet of the Extended
   Community is a "Sub-Type" field, and the remaining six octets are the
   "Value" field.  These are referred to as "Extended Types".  For other
   types, there is no Sub-Type field, and the Value field contains seven
   octets.  These are referred to as "Regular Types".

   RFC 4360 is not very specific about how the IANA registries for
   Extended Community Types and/or Sub-Types are to be organized, and
   this has led to some confusion.  The purpose of this document is to
   reorganize the registries to make the IANA codepoint allocation task
   more straightforward.


2. Types, Sub-Types, and Registries

   The high-order octet of an Extended Community will be known as the
   "Type Field".

   There will be one IANA registry for "Transitive Extended Community
   Types" (see section 5.1.1), and one for "Non-transitive Extended
   Community Types" (section 5.1.2).  Each registry specifies three
   ranges, and each range is associated with a particular IANA
   allocation policy.

   There will be a set of IANA registries for Extended Community Sub-
   Types (see section 5.2).  Each such registry will have a range of
   0x00-0xFF.  Values in the range 0x00-0xBF are assignable by IANA
   according to the "First Come, First Served" allocation policy of
   [RFC5226].  Values in the range 0xC0-0xFF are assignable by IANA
   according to the "IETF Review" allocation policy of [RFC5226].

   If a particular Type has Sub-Types, that Type's entry in its Type
   registry identifies its Sub-Type registry.  Note that some Types do
   not have Sub-Types.  When the request is made to establish a new Type

Internet Draft     draft-rosen-idr-extcomm-iana-00.txt          May 2013


   registry, the request must specify whether or not there is to be a
   Sub-Type registry associated with that Type.

   Whether a given Type has Sub-Types is determined when the Type is
   initially defined; this cannot be changed later.


3. Applicability to IPv6 Address Specific EC Attribute

   RFC 5701 [RFC5701] defines the IPv6 Address Specific Extended
   Community to be a 20-octet quantity whose high order two octets are
   the "Type Field".  The high order octet is either 0x00, indicating a
   transitive Extended Community, or 0x40, indicating a Non-transitive
   Extended Community.  The second octet is said to be a "Sub-Type" and
   it is suggested that the Sub-Types are the same as the Sub-Types for
   the IPv4-Address-Specific Extended Community.  However, the existing
   IANA codepoint allocations for this octet do not always match the
   corresponding allocations for the IPv4-Address-Specific Extended
   Community Sub-Types.

   This document modifies RFC 5701 by removing any requirement for the
   values of the second octet of the IPv6-Address-Specific Extended
   Community Type codepoints to match the codepoints in the
   IPv4-Address-Specific Sub-Types registry.

   This document requests IANA to create two IPv6-Address-Specific
   Extended Community registries, one for transitive communities and one
   for non-transitive communities.  See section 5.3.



4. How to Request EC Type and/or Sub-Type Codepoints

   When a codepoint is needed for a new Extended Community, the
   requester should first determine whether an existing Type can be
   used.  If so, IANA should be asked to allocate a codepoint from the
   corresponding Sub-Type registry, if there is one.

   If a new Extended Community Type is needed, the requester should ask
   IANA to allocate a new type from either the "Transitive Extended
   Community Types" registry, the "Non-transitive Extended Community
   Types" registry, or both.  It is up to the requester to state whether
   an allocation is needed from one or both of these registries.  When
   an allocation from both registries is requested, the requester may
   find it desirable for both allocations to share the same low-order
   six bits.  If so, it is the responsibility of the requester to
   explicitly request this of IANA.




Rosen & Rekhter                                                 [Page 5]


Internet Draft     draft-rosen-idr-extcomm-iana-00.txt          May 2013


   If a new Extended Community Type is needed, and the new Type is to
   have Sub-Types, the requester should specify whether an existing Sub-
   Type registry can be used for the new Type, or whether a new Sub-Type
   registry is needed.  (At the current time, every Type that has Sub-
   Types is associated with a unique Sub-Type registry.  It is possible
   that in the future a new Type registry may be created that is
   associated with a pre-existing Sub-Type registry.)  In either case,
   if a new Sub-Type value needs to be allocated from a particular Sub-
   Type registry, the request should explicitly identify the registry.

   If the creation of a new Sub-Type registry is requested, the range of
   values is always 0x00-0xFF.  It is recommended that the allocation
   policy described in section 2 be used.  I.e., 0x00-0xBF to be
   allocated by IANA under the "First Come, First Served" policy, and
   0xC0-0xFF to be allocated by IANA under the "IETF Review" policy.

   Commonly, a new Extended Community is defined such that it can be of
   several Types.  E.g., one may want to define a new Extended Community
   so that it can be either transitive or non-transitive, so that it can
   be either of the Two-octet AS Number Type or the Four-octet AS Number
   Type, etc.  The requester is responsible for explicitly asking IANA
   to allocate codepoints in all the necessary Type and/or Sub-Type
   registries.

   When a new Extended Community is defined, it may be necessary to ask
   IANA to allocate codepoints in several Sub-Type registries.  In this
   case, it is a common practice to ask IANA to allocate the same
   codepoint value in each registry. If this is desired, it is the
   responsibility of the requester to explicitly ask IANA to allocate
   the same value in each registry.

   When a new Extended Community Sub-Type codepoint is allocated, it may
   also be desirable to allocate a corresponding value in one or both of
   the IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community registries.  The
   requester is responsible for requesting this allocation explicitly.
   If the requester would like the same numerical value to be allocated
   in an IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community registry that is
   allocated in some other registry, it is the responsibility of the
   requester to explicitly ask this of IANA.

5. IANA Registries

   IANA is to replace the pre-existing BGP Extended Communities
   registries with the registries described in this section.

   Any Extended Community Type or Sub-type codepoints allocated by IANA
   between the date of this document that the date at which the
   registries are reorganized must also be incorporated into the new
   registry organization.  The authors will work with IANA to ensure
   that this is done correctly.

   The registries reproduced below do not include the "references" or
   "date" fields of the registries, because it is difficult to
   incorporate those within the 72-character line limitation of RFCs.
   The references and associated dates must be copied from the current
   registries when the new registries are introduced; the authors will
   work with IANA to ensure this this information is carried over
   correctly to the new registry organization.
