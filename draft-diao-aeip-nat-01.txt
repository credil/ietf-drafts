Abstract                                                                
                                                                        
   The two key issues of today's Internet are autonomy and 
   extensibility. Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology can provide 
   extensible internet architecture, own independent root DNS servers
   and self management internet network; Furthermore, based on the 
   Autonomous Internet, here provides a way with extensible address 
   capacity to solve IP address deficiency and realize 
   Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP). It mainly adopts local 
   network address based on per Autonomous IP network and uses 
   bilateral dynamic NAT with global network address between 
   Autonomous IP networks to solve IP address deficient problem. 
   This AEIP with Network Address Translation(AEIP NAT) can realize
   autonomy and extensibility with minimal cost.

Internet-Draft  Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP NAT)  September 2013
                                                                        
                                                                        
1.  Introduction                                                        
                                                                        
   Internet has become an important strategic resource for its rapid
   development all over the world. Therefore, to solve the two key
   issues of Internet, autonomy and scalability, are particularly
   important.
   
   The essence of Internet autonomous problem is to solve the domain
   name problem, so as to provide extensible architecture, provide
   multi-polar, self-control, self-management over the Internet, own 
   independent root domain name server in each autonomous internet (AIP)
   network, and safeguard global Internet without quarrel.
   
   The essence of Internet scalability problem is to solve the IP
   address shortage problem. Private network solution, dynamic address
   assignment technology, VLSM technology and NAT technology proposed
   in the field can only slow down the speed of the IP address
   depletion. Due to slow progress and many unsolved problems, IPv6 can
   not timely solve the IP address shortage problem and meet the needs
   of rapid developing Internet. The huge demand of Internet encourages
   that people must seriously consider the scalability of the IP
   network in reality.
   
   This article will discuss the IP network's scalability on the
   base of Autonomous Internet, so as to solve the current problems
   caused by IP address shortage, to realize the autonomy and extension
   of the Internet.
                                                        
                                                                        
1.1.  Specification of Requirements                                     
                                                                        
   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements 
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key   
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document  
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].                     
                                                                        
2.  Autonomous Internet Technology

   Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology provides a way to own independent
   root domain name servers to realize Autonomous Internet without
   necessary to overturn the Internet infrastructure. It provides 
   Internet global equality, free extension, and self-management.

Internet-Draft  Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP NAT)  September 2013
                                                                        
   
   According to the AIP autonomous DNS, the domain name hierarchy can
   be designed distributedly and provide each AIP network autonomy; 
   Each AIP network has its root DNS servers, which are responsible 
   for all the DNS resolution in this AIP network. Other DNS
   servers of this AIP network should point to these root DNS servers by
   default. Each AIP network is almost the same as the current Internet,
   and the internal domain name resolution and IP node communication
   have not any change. The only change is that the destination domain
   name need add domain name suffix of the destination AIP network when
   IP nodes communicate between different AIP networks. Domain node
   "www.yahoo.com" in network B is expressed as "www.yahoo.com.B" for
   its external domain name. So each AIP domain name hierarchy tree
   adds the top-level domain name "ex(i)", so as to map the other
   external AIP domain name hierarchy trees accessible from this AIP
   network. When ex(i)=B, it means that the other AIP network B is
   accessible from this AIP network. At the same time, each AIP network
   will add a kind of device called "AIP DNS gateway" to support domain
   name resolution between AIP networks.
                                      
3.  Autonomous Extensible Internet (AEIP NAT)

   Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP) is feasible not only in
   practice but also in technology. In practice, the communication
   traffic is relatively much smaller between different languages and
   cultures, and convergence of language and communication traffic
   brings the reality of Internet autonomy. In technology, AIP can
   deploy easily and cause the least change, provide security, autonomy
   and extension in architecture. AIP is distributed Internet
   architecture. This architectural distribution provides more choices
   and possibilities in solving IP address deficiency problem.
   
   Hereinafter, a technology would be introduced to realize extensible
   Internet, which is so call Autonomous Extensible Internet with
   Network Address Translation (AEIP NAT). AEIP NAT, which
   is based on AIP architecture, mainly adopts local 
   network address based on per Autonomous IP network and uses 
   bilateral dynamic NAT with global network address between 
   Autonomous IP networks to solve IP address deficient problem.

3.1.  Network Extensible Design                                          
                                                                        
   Autonomous Internet can solve the problem of Internet autonomy. 
   Moreover, its distributed architecture design makes it extensible 
   in architecture level. To increase the number of AIP network 
   entities as need, we can realize the network extension. But the 
   existing IP network address is almost used up. In further step, 
   it is necessary to realize extension of the IP network address, 
   so as to realize the extension of Internet indeed.
  
   The realization method of extensible network address space 
   is detailed as following:
   
   First of all, the concept of the "Local Network Address (LNA)" 
   is introduced inside each AEIP NAT network. The local network 
   address resource (local IP address) within each AEIP NAT network 
   includes considerable part of the Internet address space and can be 
   duplicated in different AEIP NAT networks. In general, the network 
   node can only be assigned local network address and all IP nodes 
   within each AEIP NAT network can communicate to each other directly 
   through the local network address. In this way, there are about 
   several billions of IP address in each AEIP NAT network and it can 
   solve the IP address deficient problem within each AEIP NAT network; 
   Moreover, it can provide almost any needed IP address quantities 
   if owning more AEIP NAT networks as need, which can increase the 
   IP address quantity in times. To each AEIP NAT network such as 
   A or B, it is almost consistent with the status of AIP network 
   in Autonomous Internet and is not necessary to upgrade or change 
   existing network node. The internal communication within each 
   AEIP NAT is independent from other AEIP NAT networks.

Internet-Draft  Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP NAT)  September 2013
                                                                        
   
   Secondly, "Global Network Address (GNA)" (public IP address) is 
   adopted to communicate between different AEIP NAT networks. 
   The unique Global Network Address range between AEIP NAT networks 
   is negotiated and planned globally (Under the special circumstance, 
   it can be determined within the two AEIP NAT networks, which is 
   communicating with each other). Different AEIP NAT networks will 
   be allotted different GNA range. In each AEIP NAT network, DNS 
   Gateway is responsible for the dynamic assignment of GNA. And it 
   stores and maintains the GNA - LNA pairs table (G, L) and the domain 
   name - GNA pairs table (N, G). Any GNA - LNA pair, for example 
   (Ga, La), will be sent to NAT GW during its dynamical live period 
   in order to translate address between the AEIP NAT networks. 
   During its dynamic live period, any domain name - GNA pair, 
   for example (Nb, Gb), will provide DNS GW domain name resolution 
   and GNA query between AEIP NAT networks. So its smooth transition 
   method is almost the same as Autonomous Internet except that 
   upgrading the function of DNS GW and adding NAT GW device to 
   support the NAT functions between AEIP NAT networks. In particular, 
   if unilateral action is the only way available, the unilateral 
   transformation method is the same as the method mentioned in AIP 
   and mainly relates to external domain name between AEIP NAT networks.
   Due to only public IP address is legal between AEIP NAT networks 
   before the existing Internet (the core part) can be transformed 
   into one AEIP NAT network, so the existing Internet (the core part) 
   does not need any transformation. Only in the new added AEIP NAT 
   network, it needs to upgrade the function of DNS GW and add NAT GW 
   device for cross-network address translation. The new added 
   AEIP NAT network can adopt existing or reserved public IP addresses 
   for cross-network communication. Thus the internal available 
   IP addresses will increase greatly and achieve the extension of 
   network.
   
   In addition, the "Private Network Address" (PNA, namely existing 
   private IP address) is still retained. It is used as private 
   network address within each AEIP NAT network.

3.2.  Addressing Realization
   
   Within each AEIP NAT network, IP nodes communicate to each other 
   peer-to-peer directly adopting the Local Network Address.
   
   Between different AEIP NAT networks, GNA will be adopted to locate 
   the IP node in different network. Assume that there is any one 
   IP node Na1(La1) in AEIP NAT network A, which has the domain name 
   Na1 and local network address La1. And there is any one IP node 
   Nb2(Lb2) in AEIP NAT network B, which has the domain name Nb2 and 
   local network address Lb2. The communication process from Na1 
   to Nb2 is shown as following:
   
   1)  Source Address NAT Addressing Process:
   
   It is required that the packet destination address adopts dynamic 
   allocated GNA of specific destination AEIP NAT network, for 
   example Gb2 for IP node Nb2.B (It can be obtained by DNS resolution 
   between AEIP NAT networks). Thus the source node Na1 send a 
   cross-network packet denoted as {S(La1),D(Gb2)}, which has a 
   source address La1 and a destination address Gb2. Then this 
   cross-network packet will be firstly routed to this source 
   network's interworking gateway AEIP NAT GW A. And the AEIP NAT GW A 
   will do network address translation to the source address in the 
   cross-network packet. This source address NAT adressing process 
   is detailed as following:
   
   Step 1: the AEIP NAT GW A querys the source IP node's LNA(La1) 
   corresponding record item in its GNA - LNA pairs table (G, L). 
   If corresponding GNA - LNA pair record, for example (Ga1, La1), 
   is return, the source network node's LNA(La1) in source address 
   field of packet will be replaced by corresponding GNA(Ga1). And 
   this packet, which is now denoted as {S(Ga1),D(Gb2)}, will be 
   routed to the AEIP NAT GW B of the destination network. It is 
   so called the source address NAT method.
   
   Step 2: If the AEIP NAT GW A can not find the source IP node's 
   LNA(La1) corresponding record item, for example (Ga1, La1), in 
   its GNA - LNA pairs table (G, L). Then it will send a DNS PTR query 
   to corresponding AEIP NAT DNS GW A in order to obtain the 
   domain name of the soure IP node with LNA(La1):

Internet-Draft  Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP NAT)  September 2013
                                                                        
   
     (1) If the source node has a legal domain name, AEIP DNS GW A 
     will act as an inner-network DNS agent, query and obtain source 
     node's domain name and return it to AEIP NAT GW A in a traditional 
     DNS resolution way. Then both of AEIP DNS GW A and AEIP NAT GW A 
     have the source IP node's LNA(La1) corresponding record item 
     (Na1, La1) in its domain name - LNA pairs table (N, L). At the 
     same time, the source node is assigned GNA in the corresponding 
     domain name - GNA pair record item (Na1.A, Ga1) inside AEIP NAT 
     DNS GW A in order to be visited in cross-network access and 
     receive the return ip packets. In addition, the GNA - LNA 
     pair record item (Ga1, La1) is sent to the corresponding AEIP NAT 
     GW A for NAT translation. And this GNA - LNA pair record item 
     should keep consistent in AEIP NAT DNS GW A and in AEIP NAT 
     GW A during its life time.
     
     (2) If the source node does not have the legal domain name, 
     AEIP NAT DNS GW A will assign it(local network address La1) a 
     corresponding global network address Ga1. In addition, the GNA - LNA 
     pair record item (Ga1,La1) is sent to the corresponding AEIP NAT 
     GW A for NAT translation. And this GNA - LNA pair record item 
     should keep consistent in AEIP NAT DNS GW A and in AEIP NAT 
     GW A during its life time.
     
     (3) Then the source network node's LNA(La1) in source address field 
     of packet will be replaced by corresponding GNA(Ga1). And this 
     packet, which is now denoted as {S(Ga1),D(Gb2)}, will be 
     forwarded to the AEIP NAT GW B of the destination network. 
   
   2) Destination Address NAT Addressing Process:
   
   The internetworking gateway AEIP NAT GW B in the destination 
   AEIP NAT network B will have a destination address NAT to the 
   destination address in cross-network data packet when the 
   cross-network data packet reaches the AEIP NAT GW B in AEIP NAT 
   network B. The process is detailed as following:
   
   Step 3: the AEIP NAT GW B querys the destination IP node's GNA(Gb2) 
   corresponding record item in its GNA - LNA pairs table (G, L). 
   If corresponding GNA - LNA pair record, for example (Gb2, Lb2), 
   is return, the destination network node's GNA(Gb2) in destination 
   address field of packet will be replaced by corresponding LNA(Lb2). 
   And this packet, which is now denoted as {S(Ga1),D(Lb2)}, will 
   be forwarded into the AEIP NAT network B. It is so called the 
   destination address NAT method. Finally, the packet will be 
   routed and reach the destination node.

   Step 4: If the AEIP NAT GW B can not find the destination IP node's 
   GNA(Gb2) corresponding record item, for example (Gb2, Lb2), in 
   its GNA - LNA pairs table (G, L). Then it will send a DNS PTR query 
   to corresponding AEIP NAT DNS GW B in order to obtain the 
   domain name of the destination IP node with GNA(Gb2):
   
     (1) If the destination node has a legal domain name, it should 
     be pre-assignned the corresponding domain name - GNA pair 
     record item (Nb2.B, Gb2) inside AEIP NAT DNS GW B in order that 
     the destination node can be visited in cross-network access 
     and receive the return ip packets, and this would be return to 
     AEIP NAT GW B for DNS query; At the same time, AEIP DNS GW B 
     will act as a inner-network DNS agent, query and obtain 
     destination node's domain name - LNA pair record and return it 
     to AEIP NAT GW B in a traditional DNS resolution way. Then 
     both of AEIP DNS GW B and AEIP NAT GW B have the destination 
     IP node's corresponding record item (Nb2, Lb2) in its 
     domain name - LNA pairs table (N, L). In addition, AEIP NAT 
     DNS GW B will send the GNA - LNA pair record item (Gb2, Lb2) 
     to the corresponding AEIP NAT GW B for NAT translation. And 
     this GNA - LNA pair record item should keep consistent in 
     AEIP NAT DNS GW B and in AEIP NAT GW B during its life time.
     
     (2) If the destination node does not have a legal domain name, 
     AEIP NAT DNS GW B should pre-assign it (local network address 
     Lb2) a corresponding global network address Gb2 for 
     cross-network communication. In addition, the GNA - LNA pair 
     record item (Gb2-Lb2) is sent to the corresponding AEIP NAT 
     GW B for NAT translation. And this GNA - LNA pair record item 
     should keep consistent in AEIP NAT DNS GW B and in AEIP NAT 
     GW B during its life time.
     
     (3).Then AEIP NAT GW B would process the packet by the 
     destination address NAT method. Here the destination network 
     node's GNA(Gb2) in destination address field of packet will 
     be replaced by corresponding LNA(Lb2) and this packet, which 
     is now denoted as {S(Ga1),D(Lb2)}, will be forwarded into 
     the AEIP NAT network B. Finally, the packet will be routed 
     and reach the destination node.

Internet-Draft  Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP NAT)  September 2013
                                                                        
   
   complete set of domain name system to support the resolution of 
   domain name and address within the network. Each network node 
   has a default unique network domain name suffix whether is marked 
   or not. The default unique network domain name suffix should be 
   added while accessing to this external network node.
   
   The AEIP NAT DNS gateway (AEIP NAT DNS GW) in each AEIP NAT network 
   is evolved on the basis of AIP DNS GW to support cross-network 
   DNS resolution between AEIP NAT networks. AEIP NAT DNS GW forwards 
   the cross-network DNS query originated in this AEIP NAT network. 
   And it provides and/or stores the dynamic assigned GNA for IP node 
   in this AEIP NAT network. It responses with the corresponding 
   dynamic assigned GNA for IP node in this AEIP NAT network to the 
   cross-network DNS query originated in external AEIP NAT network.
   
   The DNS resolution process is described as following:
   
   Within each AEIP NAT network, the DNS resolution is the same a
   s the traditional way.
   
   Between different AEIP NAT networks, when the source IP node 
   originates a cross-network DNS resolution query, this query 
   would be routed to this source network's AEIP NAT DNS GW A and 
   then be forwarded to domain name affiliated destination network's 
   AEIP NAT DNS GW B. The AEIP NAT DNS GW B in destination network 
   would process this corss-network DNS query as following:
   
   Step 1: First, the AEIP NAT DNS GW B will query whether there is 
   corresponding domain name - GNA pair record item (Nb2.B, Gb2) 
   in its record tables. If yes, AEIP NAT DNS GW B will return 
   the record item (Nb2.B, Gb2) to the DNS requester and eventually 
   it will reach the source IP node which originates the query.
   
   Step 2: If the AEIP NAT GW B can not find the destination IP node's 
   corresponding domain name record or domain name - GNA pair 
   record item, for example (Nb2.B, Gb2), in its domain name - GNA pairs
   table (N, G), it will act as a inner-network DNS agent, query and 
   obtain destination node's domain name - LNA pair record, for 
   example (Nb2, Lb2) and return it to AEIP NAT GW B in a traditional 
   DNS resolution way. At the same time, the destination node is 
   assignned the corresponding domain name - GNA pair record item 
   (Nb2.B, Gb2) inside AEIP NAT DNS GW B in order to be visited in 
   cross-network access. AEIP NAT DNS GW B will return the record item 
   (Nb2.B, Gb2) to the DNS requester and eventually it will reach the 
   source IP node which originates the query. In addition, the 
   GNA - LNA pair record item (Gb2, Lb2) is sent to the corresponding 
   AEIP NAT GW B for NAT translation. And this GNA - LNA pair record 
   item should keep consistent in AEIP NAT DNS GW B and in AEIP NAT 
   GW B during its life time.

4.  Conclusion                                                          
                                                                        
   The huge demand of Internet encourages that people must seriously 
   consider the scalability of the IP network. So as to solve the 
   two key issues of Internet, autonomy and scalability, are 
   particularly important. Based on Autonomous Internet architecture, 
   Autonomous Extensible Internet with Network Address Translation 
   (AEIP NAT) mainly adopts local network address based on per 
   Autonomous IP network and uses bilateral NAT with global network 
   address between Autonomous IP networks to solve IP address 
   deficient problem. It provides an integrated solution to Internet 
   autonomy and extension issues. In practice, it has little 
   reformation work, smooth transition and can be implemented 
   even in unilateral technical action to realize Autonomous 
   Extensible Internet.
   
                                                              
5.  Security Considerations                                             
                                                                        
   There is no additional security requirement than current Internet 
   system. Security issues are not discussed in this memo.              
                                                                        
                                                                        
6.  IANA Considerations                                                 
                                                                        
   According to the AEIP NAT solution and the design of the
   extensible address space, IANA need to plan proper ratio
   of GNA and LNA in 32-bit IP version 4 address capacity and adjust 
   their assignment in different AEIP NAT networks.
