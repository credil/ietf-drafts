    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an RTCP XR Report Block that allows the
      reporting of Burst and Gap Discard metrics for use in a range of RTP
      applications.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <section title="Burst and Gap Discard Report Block">
        <t>This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
        <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> for use in a range of RTP applications.
        The new block type supports the reporting of the proportion of packets
        discarded by the receiver due to jitter. The discards during discard
        bursts are reported, together with the number of bursts and additional
        data allowing the calculation of statistical parameters (mean and
        variance) of the distribution of burst lengths. This block is intended
        to be used in conjunction with <xref target="DISCARD"></xref> which
        provides the total packets discarded, and on which this block
        therefore depends. However the metric in <xref
        target="DISCARD"></xref> may be used independently of the metrics in
        this block.</t>

        <t>This block provides information on transient IP problems. Burst/Gap
        metrics are typically used in Cumulative reports however MAY be used
        in Interval reports. The burstiness of packet discard affects user
        experience, may influence any sender strategies to mitigate the
        problem, and may also have diagnostic value.</t>

        <t>The metric belongs to the class of transport-related terminal
        metrics defined in <xref target="MONARCH"></xref> (work in
        progress).</t>

        <t>The definitions of Burst, Gap, Loss and Discard are consistent with
        definitions in <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>. To accommodate the
        range of jitter buffer algorithms and packet discard logic that may be
        used by implementors, the method used to distinguish between bursts
        and gaps may be an equivalent method to that defined in<xref
        target="RFC3611"></xref> .</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defined an
        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This draft defines a new Extended Report block that MUST be used as
        defined in <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. Metrics described in this draft either reference external
        definitions or define metrics generally in accordance with the
        guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <section title="Standards Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>In addition, the following terms are defined:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Received, Lost and Discarded"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to
            arrive within an implementation-specific time window. A packet
            that arrives within this time window but is too early or late to
            be played out shall be regarded as discarded. A packet shall be
            classified as one of received (or OK), discarded or lost. <vspace
            blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Bursts and Gaps"><vspace blankLines="1" />The terms
            Burst and Gap are used in a manner consistent with that of RTCP XR
            [RFC3611]. RTCP XR views a RTP stream as being divided into
            bursts, which are periods during which the loss rate is high
            enough to cause noticeable quality degradation (generally over 5
            percent loss rate), and gaps, which are periods during which lost
            packets are infrequent and hence quality is generally acceptable.

      <section title="Derived metrics based on reported metrics">
        <t>The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
        this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
        Information block <xref target="MEASID"></xref>, discard block <xref
        target="DISCARD"></xref> (which MUST be present in the same RTCP
        packet as the Burst/Gap Discard block).</t>

        <t>These metrics provides the following information relevant to
        statistical parameters, including:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The fraction of packets discarded during bursts (burst discard
            rate in <xref target="SUMSTAT"></xref>)</t>

            <t>The fraction of packets discarded during gaps (gap discard rate
            in <xref target="SUMSTAT"></xref>)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The details on calculation these parameters in the metrics are
        described in <xref target="SUMSTAT"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Considerations for Voice-over-IP applications">
      <t>This metric block is applicable to a broad range of RTP applications.
      Where the metric is used with a Voice-overIP (VoIP) application, the
      following considerations apply.</t>

      <t>RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
      during which the loss rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
      quality degradation (generally over 5 percent loss rate), and gaps,
      which are periods during which lost packets are infrequent and hence
      call quality is generally acceptable.</t>

      <t>If Voice Activity Detection is used the Burst and Gap Duration shall
      be determined as if silence frames had been sent, i.e. a period of
      silence in excess of Gmin frames MUST terminate a burst condition.</t>

      <t>The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in [RFC3611] results in
      a Burst being a period of time during which the call quality is degraded
      to a similar extent to a typical PCM Severely Errored Second <xref
      target="PSES"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="SDP Signaling">
      <t>[RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol) <xref
      target="RFC4566"></xref> for signaling the use of XR blocks. XR blocks
      MAY be used without prior signaling.</t>

      <t>This section augments the SDP <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>
      attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> by
      providing an additional value of "xr-format" to signal the use of the

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
