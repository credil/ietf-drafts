1. Introduction

   MAP [I-D. draft-ietf-softwire-map] is a stateless mechanism for
   running IPv4 over IPv6-only infrastructure. In particular, it
   includes two mode, translation mode or encapsulation mode. For the
   encapsulation mode, it provides an automatic tunnelling mechanism
   for providing IPv4 connectivity service to end users over a service
   provider's IPv6 network.

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. This MIB module may be used for monitoring the devices in
   the MAP scenario, especially, for the encapsulation mode.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the MIB. MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

3. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4. Structure of the MIB Module

   The MAP-E MIB provides a way to configure and manage the devices in
   MAP encapsulation mode through SNMP.

   MAP-E MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis. It depends on
   several parts of the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

4.1. The mapMIBObjects

4.1.1. The mapRule Subtree

   The mapRule subtree describes managed objects used for managing the
   multiple mapping rules in the MAP encapsulation mode.

   According to the MAP specification, the mapping rules are divided
   into two categories, which are BMR (Basic Mapping Rule), and FMR
   (Forwarding Mapping Rule).

4.1.2. The mapSecurityCheck Subtree

   The mapSecurityCheck subtree is to statistic the number of invalid
   packets that been identified. There are two kind of invalid packets
   which are defined in the MAP specification as the following.

   - The BR MUST perform a validation of the consistency of the source
   IPv6 address and source port number for the packet using BMR.
   - The CE SHOULD check that MAP received packets' transport-layer
   destination port number is in the range configured by MAP for the CE.

4.2. The mapMIBConformance Subtree

   The mapMIBConformance subtree provides conformance information of
   MIB objects.

6. IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------
      MAP-E-MIB          { transmission XXX }

7. Security Considerations

   The MAP-E MIB module can be used for configuration of certain
   objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly
   configured, with potentially disastrous results. Because this MIB
   module reuses the IP tunnel MIB, the security considerations for
   these MIBs are also applicable to the MAP-E MIB.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principles (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
