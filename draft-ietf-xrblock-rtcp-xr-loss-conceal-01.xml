        <t>
          This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
          Friedman, et al.&nbsp;<xref target="RFC3611"/>
          for use in a range of RTP applications.
        </t>

        <t>
          At any instant, the audio output at a receiver may be classified as
          either 'normal' or 'concealed'. 'Normal' refers to playout of audio
          payload received from the remote end, and also includes locally
          generated signals such as announcements, tones and comfort noise.
          Concealment refers to playout of locally-generated signals used to
          mask the impact of network impairments or to
          reduce the audibility of
          jitter buffer adaptations.
        </t>

        <t>
          The new block type provides metrics for actions taken by the
          receiver to mitigate the effect of packet loss and packet discard.
          Specifically, the first metric (On-Time Playout Duration) reports
          the duration of normal playout of data which the receiver obtained
          from the sender's stream. A second metric
          (Loss Concealment Duration)
          reports the total time during which the receiver played out media
          data
          which was manufactured locally, because the sender's data for these
          periods was not available due to packet loss or discard.
          A similar
          metric (Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration) reports the duration
          of playout of locally-manufactured data replacing data which is
          unavailable due to adaptation of an adaptive de-jitter buffer.
          Further
          metrics (Playout Interrupt Count and Mean Playout Interrupt Size)
          report the number of times normal playout was interrupted, and the
          mean duration of these interruptions.
        </t>

        <t>
          Loss Concealment Duration and Buffer Adjustment Concealment
          Duration are reported separately because buffer adjustment is
          typically arranged to occur in silence periods so may have very little
          impact on user experience, whilst loss concealment may occur at any
          time.
        </t>

        <t>
          The metric belongs to the class of transport-related terminal
          metrics defined in
          Wu, et al.&nbsp;<xref target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-monarch"/>.

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
        <t>
          The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in
          Schulzrinne, et al.&nbsp;<xref target="RFC3550"/>.
          Friedman, Cacares &amp; Clark <xref target="RFC3611"/> define an
          extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report
          (XR).
          This draft defines a new Extended Report block that MUST be used as
          defined in RFC 3550 and RFC 3611.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>
          Clark &amp; Claise <xref target="RFC6390"/>
          provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
          metrics. Wu, et al.&nbsp;<xref target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-monarch"/>
          provides guidelines for RTCP XR report block formats.
          The report block defined in this document is in
          accordance with those guidelines.
        </t>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>

            <t hangText="On-time Playout Duration (ms): 32 bits">
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              'On-time' playout is the uninterrupted,
              in-sequence playout of valid decoded audio information originating
              from the remote endpoint. This includes comfort noise during
              periods of remote talker silence, if voice activity detection (VAD)
              is in use, and locally
              generated or regenerated tones and announcements.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              An equivalent definition is that on-time playout
              is playout of any signal other than those used for concealment.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              On-time playout duration MUST include
              both speech and silence intervals, whether VAD is used or not.
              This duration is reported in millisecond units.
            </t>

            <t>
              If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
              SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the
              measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF SHOULD be
              reported.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
            </t>

            <t hangText="Loss Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits">
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout
              corresponding to Loss-type concealment.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              Loss-type concealment is reactive insertion or
              deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to effective
              frame loss at the audio decoder. "Effective frame loss" is the
              event in which a frame of coded audio is simply not present at the
              audio decoder when required. In this case, substitute audio
              samples are generally formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to
              reduce audible impairment.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              If the
              measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE SHOULD be
              reported to indicate an over-range measurement. If the measurement
              is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.
            <vspace blankLines="1" />
            </t>

            <t hangText="Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits">
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout
              corresponding to Buffer Adjustment-type concealment, if known.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD,
              the value 0xFFFFFFFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range
              measurement. If the measurement is unavailable, the value
              0xFFFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              Buffer
              Adjustment-type concealment is proactive or controlled insertion
              or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due to jitter
              buffer adaptation, re-sizing or re-centering decisions within the
              endpoint.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              Because this insertion is
              controlled, rather than occurring randomly in response to losses,
              it is typically less audible than loss-type concealment. For
              example, jitter buffer adaptation events may be constrained to
              occur during periods of talker silence, in which case only silence
              duration is affected, or sophisticated time-stretching methods for
              insertion/deletion during favorable periods in active speech may
              be employed.
              <vspace blankLines="1" />
              Concealment events which
              cannot be classified as Buffer Adjustment- type MUST be classified
              as Loss-type.

              If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
              0xFFFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.
              If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
        new security considerations beyond those described in RFC 3611.
        This block does not provide per-packet
        statistics so the risk to confidentiality documented in Section 7,
        paragraph 3 of RFC 3611 does not apply.
