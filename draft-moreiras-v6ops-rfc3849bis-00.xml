    <abstract>

      <t><xref target="RFC3849" /> specified an IPv6 prefix to be used in documentation, 
         in order to reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating examples 
         of deployed systems. This prefix was reserved to be used in examples in RFCs, books, 
         documentation, and the like. It became widely accepted and used.</t>

      <t>Although the IPv6 documentation prefix proved to be very useful, a /32 prefix is 
         not enough to be used to document some kinds of IPv6 deployments, such as large ISP 
         deployments, transition techniques, and other useful examples that require longer prefixes. 
         This document requests the allocation of a new global unicast /20 block, as a documentation 
         prefix, and expands the range of uses that can be expected for these prefixes. It also
         updates <xref target="RFC3849" />.</t>

    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">

    <t>This document describes the IPv6 address blocks provided to be used in documentation. 
       These blocks SHOULD be used to describe network topologies, transition techniques or 
       other systems, in RFCs, books, videos, and documentation in general. They also MAY be 
       used in didactic laboratories, which aim to teach IPv6 or network principles.</t>

    <t>The first block was reserved in <xref target="RFC3849" />, from the address space of 
       the Asia Pacific (APNIC) regional addressing community. Other documentation ranges 
       have been defined in the IETF, such as example domain names described in 
       <xref target="RFC2606" />,  and IPv4 documentation-only address blocks described 
       in <xref target="RFC5737" />. The IPv4 ranges  reserved in <xref target="RFC1918" /> 
       for private use are also used in documentation, as well as the Autonomous System 
       numbers reserved in <xref target="RFC6996" />.</t>

    <t>Although the address block defined in <xref target="RFC3849" /> was within the range 
       of a conventional allocation size for an Internet Service Provider, and it was expected
       that it could accurately match deployment scenarios, there are some situations that can't 
       be represented accordingly with a prefix of 32 bits, such as: transition techniques, 
       peering between multiple ISPs, IPv6 address plan for multi-regional ISPs, and others.</t>

    <t>This situation leads to the same problem that <xref target="RFC3849" /> tried to address. 
       Some documentation material, particularly some didactic material and laboratories, today 
       is using IPv6 prefixes drawn from address blocks already allocated or assigned. A similar 
       situation with IPv4 addresses caused problems in production environments, because of 
       address and routing conflicts with other services.</t>

    <t>This document reserves an additional larger IPv6 block for documentation, avoiding such 
       problems. It does not obsolete the current IPv6 documentation block 2001:0db8::/32, 
       since it is widely deployed. Nonetheless, it updates the current practice and specifies 
       one larger IPv6 block, for the same use.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="IPv6 Documentation Prefixes">

        <t>The blocks provided for use in documentation are: 2001:0db8::/32 (v6-TEST-NET-1), 
           and DDDD:D000::/20 [Note to RFC Editor: this address range is to be added
           before publication] (v6-TEST-NET-2).</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Operational Implications">

        <t>Addresses within the v6-TEST-NET-1, and v6-TEST-NET-2, SHOULD NOT appear on the public 
           Internet and are used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet Regional Registry 
           (RIR). Network operators SHOULD add these address blocks to the list of non-routeable
           address spaces, and if packet filters are deployed, then this address block SHOULD be 
           added to packet filters.</t>

        <t>These blocks are not for local use, and the filters may be used in both local and public
           contexts.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Security Considerations">

        <t>There are no new security considerations pertaining to this document.</t>

    </section>
       
    <section title="IANA Considerations">

       <t>IANA recorded the allocation of the IPv6 global unicast address prefix v6-TEST-NET-1 
          as a documentation-only prefix in the IPv6 address registry.</t>

       <t>IANA is asked to record the allocation of v6-TEST-NET-2 prefix, within the range 
          reserved for Global IPv6 addresses, for use as an additional documentation-only prefix, 
          in the IPv6 address registry.</t>

       <t>No end party is to be assigned any of these address blocks.</t>
