         RTP Header Extension for RTCP Source Description Items
                draft-westerlund-avtext-sdes-hdr-ext-01

Abstract

   Source Description (SDES) items are normally transported in RTP
   control protocol (RTCP).  In some cases it can be beneficial to speed
   up the delivery of these items.  Mainly when a new source (SSRC)
   joins an RTP session and the receivers needs this source's relation
   to other sources and its synchronization context, which are fully or
   partially identified using SDES items.  To enable this optimization,
   this document specifies a new RTP header extension that can carry any
   type of SDES items.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an RTP header extension [RFC3550][RFC5285]
   that can carry RTCP source description (SDES) items.  By including
   selected SDES items in an header extension the determination of
   relationship and synchronization context for new RTP packet streams
   (SSRCs) in an RTP session can be speeded up.  Which relationship and
   what information depends on the SDES items carried.  This becomes a
   complement to using only RTCP for SDES Item delivery.

   First, some requirements language is defined.  The following section
   motivates why this header extension is sometimes required or at least
   provides a significant improvement compared to waiting for regular
   RTCP packet transmissions of the information.  This is followed by a
   specification of the header extension.  Next, a sub-space of the

   header-extension URN is defined to be used for existing and future
   SDES items, and the existing SDES items are registered.

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in "A Taxonomy of Grouping
   Semantics and Mechanisms for Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
   Sources" [I-D.lennox-raiarea-rtp-grouping-taxonomy] . In particular
   the following definitions:

      Media Source

      Packet Stream

      Media Encoder

      Encoded Stream

      Participant

3.  Motivation

   Source Description (SDES) items are being associated with a
   particular SSRC and thus RTP packet stream.  The source description
   items provide various meta data associated with the SSRC.  How
   important it is to have this data no later than when receiving the
   first RTP packets depends on the item itself.  The CNAME item is one
   item that is commonly needed if not at reception of the first RTP
   packet for this SSRC, so at least by the time the first media can be
   played out.  If not, the synchronization context cannot be determined
   and thus any related streams cannot be correctly synchronized.  Thus,
   this is a great example for the need to have this information early
   when a new packet stream is received.

   The main reason for new SSRCs in an RTP session is that a media
   sources are added.  This either because an end-point is adding a new
   actual media source, or additional participants in a multi-party
   session being added to the session.  Another reason for a new SSRC
   can be an SSRC collision that forces the colliding parties to select
   a new SSRC.

   Returning to the case of rapid media synchronization, there exist an
   RTP header extension for Rapid Synchronisation of RTP Flows
   [RFC6051].  That header extension carries the clock information
   present in the RTCP sender report (SR) packets.  It however assumes
   that the CNAME binding is known, which can be provided via signalling
   in some cases, but not all.  Thus an RTP header extension for
   carrying SDES items like CNAME is a powerful combination to enable
   rapid synchronization in all cases.

   The Rapid Synchronisation of RTP Flows specification does provide an
   analysis of the initial synchronization delay for different sessions
   depending on number of receivers as well as on session bandwidth
   (Section 2.1 of [RFC6051]).  These results are applicable also for
   other SDES items that have a similar time dependency until the
   information can be sent using RTCP.  Thus the benefit for reduction
   of initial delay before information is available can be determined
   for some use cases from these figures.

   That document also discusses the case of late joiners, and defines an
   RTCP Feedback format to request synchronization information, which is
   another potential use case for SDES items in RTP header extension.
   It would for example be natural to include CNAME SDES item with the
   header extension containing the NTP formatted reference clock to
   ensure synchronization.

   Some new SDES items are currently proposed, which can all benefit
   from timely delivery:

   SRCNAME:  This is a media source and encoding identifier to enable
      support for simulcast and improve some scalable encoding usages
      [I-D.westerlund-avtext-rtcp-sdes-srcname].  This SDES item could
      be used both for new sources and late joiners.

   APPID:  This SDES item provides an application specific identifier
      dynamically assigned to a particular packet stream.  The intention
      is to provide a receiver with information about the current role
      of the received packet stream or its usage in an application
      [I-D.even-mmusic-application-token].  Thus a particular ID can be
      reassigned many times during the lifetime of an RTP session.  This
      puts additional timing requirements, not only for new sources and
      late joiners, but also whenever the Application token is
      reassigned to another stream.

   Based on the above, there appear to be good reasons why an RTP header
   extension for SDES items is worthwhile to pursue.

4.  Specification

   This section first specifies the SDES item RTP header extension
   format, followed by some usage considerations.

4.1.  SDES Item Header Extension

   The RTP header extension scheme that allows for multiple extensions
   to be included is defined in "A General Mechanism for RTP Header
   Extensions" [RFC5285].  That specification defines both short and
   long item headers.  The short headers (One-byte) are restricted to 1
   to 16 bytes of data, while the long format (Two-byte) supports a data
   length of 0 to 255 bytes.  Thus that RTP header extension format is
   capable of supporting any SDES item from a data length perspective.

   The ID field, independent of short or long format, identifies both
   the type of RTP header extension and, in the case of the SDES item
   header extension, the type of SDES item.  The mapping is done in
   signalling by identifying the header extension and SDES item type
   using a URN, which is defined in the IANA consideration (Section 5)
   for all existing SDES items.

4.1.1.  One-Byte Format

   The one-byte header format for an SDES item extension element
   consists of the One-Byte header (defined in Section 4.2 of
   [RFC5285]), which consists of a 4-bit ID followed by a 4-bit length
   field (len) that identifies how many bytes (len value +1) of data
   that follows the header.  The data part consists of len+1 bytes of
   UTF-8 text.  The type of text is determined by the ID field value and
   its mapping to the type of SDES item.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

4.1.2.  Two-Byte Format

   The two-byte header format for an SDES item extension element
   consists of the two-byte header (defined in Section 4.3 of
   [RFC5285]), which consists of an 8-bit ID followed by an 8-bit length
   field (len) that identifies how many bytes of data that follows the
   header.  The data part consists of len bytes of UTF-8 text.  The type
   of text is determined by the ID field value and its mapping to the
   type of SDES item.

4.2.  Usage of the SDES Item Header Extension

   This section discusses various usage considerations; which form of
   header extension to use, the packet expansion, and when to send SDES
   items in header extension.

4.2.1.  One or Two Byte Headers

   The RTP header extensions for SDES items MAY use either the one-byte
   or two-byte header formats, depending on the text value size for the
   used SDES items.  The one-byte header SHOULD be used when all non
   SDES item header extensions supports the one-byte format and all SDES
   item text values contain at most 16 bytes.  Note that the RTP header
   extension specification does not allow mixing one-byte and two-byte
   headers for the same RTP packet stream (SSRC), so if the value size
   of any of the SDES items value requires the two-byte header, the all
   other header extensions MUST also use the two-byte header format.

   For example using CNAMEs that are generated according to "Guidelines
   for Choosing RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Names (CNAMEs)"
   [RFC7022], using short term persistent values, and if 96-bit random
   values prior to base64 encoding are sufficient, then they will fit
   into the One-Byte header format.

4.2.2.  MTU and Packet Expansion

   The RTP packet size will clearly increase when they include the
   header extension.  How much depends on which header extensions and
   their data parts.  The SDES items can vary in size.  There are also
   some use-cases which require transmitting multiple SDES items in the
   same packet to ensure that all relevant data reaches the receiver.
   An example of that is when you need both the CNAME, a SRCNAME and an
   APPID plus the rapid time synchronization extension from RFC 6051.
   Such a combination is quite likely to result in at least 16+3+1+8
   bytes of data plus the headers, which will be another 8 bytes for
   one-byte headers, thus in total 36 bytes.

   The packet expansion can cause an issue when it cannot be taken into
   account when producing the RTP payload.  Thus an RTP payload that is
   created to meet a particular IP level Maximum Transmission Unit



Westerlund, et al.       Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 6]

   (MTU), taking the addition of IP/UDP/RTP headers into account but
   excluding RTP header extensions suddenly exceeds the MTU, resulting
   in IP fragmentation.  IP fragmentation is known to negatively impact
   the loss rate due to middleboxes unwilling or not capable of dealing
   with IP fragments.

   As this is a real issue, the media encoder and payload packetizer
   should be flexible and be capable of handling dynamically varying
   payload size restrictions to counter the packet expansion caused by
   header extensions.  If that is not possible, some reasonable worst
   case packet expansion should be calculated and used to reduce the RTP
   payload size of all RTP packets the sender transmits.

4.2.3.  Transmission Considerations

   The general recommendation is to only send header extensions when
   needed.  This is especially true for SDES items that can be sent in
   periodic repetitions of RTCP throughout the whole session.  Thus, the
   different usages (Section 4.2.4) have different recommendations.
   First some general considerations for getting the header extensions
   delivered to the receiver:

   1.  The probability for packet loss and burst loss determine how many
       repetitions of the header extensions will be required to reach a
       targeted delivery probability, and if bust loss is likely what
       dispersion would be needed to avoid getting multiple header
       extensions lost in a single burst.

   2.  How early the SDES item information is needed, from the first
       received RTP data or only after some set of packets are received,
       can guide if the header extension(s) should be in all of the
       first N packets or be included only once per set of packets, for
       example once per video frame.

   3.  The use of RTP level robustness mechanisms, such as RTP
       retransmission [RFC4588], or Forward Error Correction, e.g.,
       [RFC5109] may treat packets differently from a robustness
       perspective, and SDES header extensions should be added to
       packets that get a treatment corresponding to the relative
       importance of receiving the information.

   In summary, the number of header extension transmissions should be
   tailored to a desired probability of delivery taking the receiver
   population size into account.  For the very basic case, N repetitions
   of the header extensions should be sufficient, but may not be
   optimal.  N is selected so that probability of delivery of at least
   one out of the N reaches the target value when calculating 1-P^N,
   where P is the probability of packet loss.  For point to point or

   small receiver populations, it might also be possible to use
   feedback, such as RTCP, to determine when the information in the
   header extensions has likely reached all receivers.

4.2.4.  Different Usages

4.2.4.1.  New SSRC

   A new SSRC joins an RTP session.  As this SSRC is completely new for
   everyone, the goal is to ensure that all receivers with high
   probability receives the information in the header extension.  Thus
   header extension transmission strategies that allow some margins in
   the delivery probability should be considered.

4.2.4.2.  Late Joiner

   In a multi-party RTP session where one or a small number of receivers
   join a session where the majority of receivers already have all
   necessary information, the use of header extensions to deliver
   relevant information should be tailored to reach the new receivers.
   The trigger to send header extensions can for example either be RTCP
   from new receiver(s) or an explicit request like the Rapid
   Resynchronisation Request defined in [RFC6051].

4.2.4.3.  Information Change

   In cases when the SDES item text value is changed and the new SDES
   information is tightly coupled to and thus needs to be synchronized
   with a related change in the RTP stream, use of a header extension is
   far superior to RTCP SDES.  In this case it is equal or even more
   important with timely SDES information than in the case of new SSRCs
   (Section 4.2.4.1).  Continued use of the old SDES information can
   lead to really undesired effects in the application.  Application
   Token [I-D.even-mmusic-application-token] would be one such case.
   Thus, header extension transmission strategies with high probability
   of delivery should be chosen.

4.2.5.  SDES Items in RTCP

   As this RTP header extensions information, i.e. SDES Items can and
   will be sent also in RTCP it is worth some reflections on this
   interaction.  There also exist the possibility to schedule a non-
   regular RTCP packet transmission containing important SDES items if
   one uses a RTP/AVPF based RTP profile.  Depending on which mode ones
   RTCP feedback transmitter is working on extra RTCP packets may be
   sent as immediate or early packets, enabling more timely deliver of
   SDES information.

   There is however two aspects that differ between using RTP header
   extension and any non-regular transmission of RTCP packets.  First,
   as the RTCP packet is a separate packet, there is no direct relation
   and also no fate sharing between the relevant media data and the SDES
   information.  The order of arrival for the packets will matter.  With
   a header-extension the SDES items can be ensured to arrive if the
   media data to played out arrives.  Secondly, it is difficult to
   determine if an RTCP packet is actually delivered.  This, as the RTCP
   packets lack both sequence number or a mechanism providing feedback
   on the RTCP packets themselves.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This IANA section firstly proposes to:

   o  Reserve the SDES item RTP header extension defined in this
      document for use with current and future SDES items.

   o  Register and assign the URN sub-space "urn:ietf:params:rtp-
      hdrext:sdes:" in the RTP Compact Header Extensions registry.

   The reason to require registering a URN within that sub-space is that
   the name represent an RTCP Source Description item, where a
   specification is strongly recommended.  The formal policy is
   maintained from the main space, i.e. Expert Review.

   Secondly, it is proposed that all the current existing SDES items are
   registered for usage in the RTP Compact Header Extensions registry :

6.  Security Considerations

   Source Description items may contain data that are sensitive from a
   security perspective.  There exist SDES items that are or may be
   sensitive from a user privacy perspective, like CNAME, NAME, EMAIL,
   PHONE, LOC and H323-CADDR.  Others may contain sensitive information
   like NOTE and PRIV, while others may be sensitive from profiling
   implementations for vulnerability or other reasons, like TOOL.  The
   CNAME sensitivity can vary depending on how it is generated and what
   persistence it has.  A short term CNAME identifier generated using a
   random number generator may have minimal security implications, while
   one of the form user@host has privacy concerns and one generated from
   a MAC address has long term tracking potentials.

   The above security concerns may have to be put in relation to needs
   of third party monitoring.  In RTP sessions where any type of
   confidentiality protection is enabled, the SDES item header
   extensions SHOULD also be protected per default.  This implies that
   to provide confidentiality, users of SRTP need to implement encrypted
   header extensions per [RFC6904].  Commonly, it is expected that the
   same security level is applied both RTCP packets carrying SDES items,
   as a RTP header extension containing a SDES item.  If the security
   level is different it is important to consider the security
   properties as the worst in each aspect for the different
   configurations.

   As the SDES items are used by the RTP based application to establish
   relationships between packet streams or between a packet stream and
   information about the originating Participant, there SHOULD be strong
   requirements on integrity and source authentication of the header
   extensions.  If not, an attacker can modify the SDES item value to
   create erroneous relationship bindings in the receiving application.
