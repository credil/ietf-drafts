      <t>This memo describes an extension to the DNS protocol that 
         support the remote provisioning of zones on authoritative
         servers.  This addition is complementary to the
         existing mechanisms for provisioning zone data using
         the DNS protocol.</t>

    <section title="Definitions">
      <t>This memo uses the following DNS server roles in a manner
        consistent with <xref target="RFC2136">RFC&nbsp;2136</xref>:
        <list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Slave">An authoritative server that uses AXFR
            or IXFR to retrieve the zone and is named in the zone's 
            NS RRset.</t>          
          <t hangText="Master">An authoritative server configured to
            be the source of AXFR or IXFR data for one or more slave
            servers.</t>
        </list></t>
      <t>This memo uses the term "catalog of zones" in the spirit of
         <xref target="RFC1035">RFC&nbsp;1035</xref> to describe the 
         set of zones that a server is authoritative for.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>It is common practice for Internet service providers and
         domain name registrars to operate DNS servers that are 
         simultaneously authoritative for many zones. In some case
         a single DNS server may be authoritative for hundreds of
         thousands of zones. Despite the large number of zones 
         served, the server is unlikely to also be authoritative
         for a common parent of these zones and so must operate 
         each zone independently.</t>
      <t>The DNS protocol supports the provisioning of resource 
         records in zones already being served by an authoritative
         DNS server using the DNS UPDATE message described in
         <xref target="RFC2136">RFC&nbsp;2136</xref>. However
         no similar operation exists to update the list of zones
         that a server serves.</t>
      <t>This memo describes an extension to the DNS UPDATE 
         message that allows it to be used to instruct an 
         authoritative DNS server to start serving or stop serving 
         zones. This extension supports the remote provisioning 
         of zones in the same manner that DNS UPDATE supports the 
         remote provisioning of Resource Records.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="message" title="Extending the DNS UPDATE message">
      
      <t><xref target="RFC2136">RFC&nbsp;2136</xref> defines the
         DNS UPDATE message which enables the remote provisioning 
         of data within existing zones. The operations enabled by 
         <xref target="RFC2136">RFC&nbsp;2136</xref> are now
         referred to as 'in zone' operations.</t>
      <t>This memo extends the definition of the DNS UPDATE
         message to enable the remote provisioning of zones.
         The operations enabled by this memo are referred to as
         'whole of zone' operations.</t>
      <t>Two 'whole of zone' operations are defined in this memo:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Adding zones. Instructing the receiving server to add one or more
             zones to the catalog of authoritative zones that it serves and 
             start serving these zone, either as a master or a slave.</t>
          <t>Removing zones. Instructing the receiving server to stop serving
             one or more authoritative zones and remove them from the catalog 
             of zones that it serves.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The operations described in this memo operate on the catalog of zones
         irrespective of whether or not the server is currently responding
         to queries for a specific zone as a server may at any point time be 
         actively serving only some of the zones in its catalog for operational 
         reasons.</t>
      
      <section anchor="operationtypes" title="'in zone' vs 'whole of zone' operations">
        <t>'in zone' operations are distinguished from 'whole of zone'
            operations by the ZTYPE of the zones in the Zone section
            of the DNS UPDATE message:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>For 'in zone' operations the ZTYPE of all of the zones 
               in the Zone section MUST be SOA.</t>
            <t>For 'whole of zone' operations the ZTYPE of all of the
               zones in the Zone section MUST be NS.</t>  
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>It is not possible to have both 'in zone' and 'whole of zone'
           operations in the same DNS UPDATE message and so the zones in 
           the Zone section MUST NOT have different ZTYPES.
        </t>
        <t>'whole of zone' operations interpret the data in the 
           Prerequisite, Update and Additional sections differently from
           'in zone' operations.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="addoperation" title="Adding zones">
        <t>The operation to add new authoritative zones can come in one of 
           two forms:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Add a master zone.  Instructing the receiving server to 
               add a new zone and serve that zone as a master.</t>
            <t>Adding slave zones.  Instructing the receiving server to add 
               one or more new zones and serve those as a slave.</t>
          </list>
        </t>  
        
        <section anchor="addmaster" title="Adding a master zone">
          <t>To add a master zone the DNS UPDATE is constructed as follows:</t>
          <t>One zone and only one zone MUST be listed in the Zone section.
             and the ZTYPE of that zone MUST be set to NS.</t>
          <t>The Prerequisitie section MUST be empty.</t>
          <t>The Update section MUST contain the SOA record for the new zone.
             The class of the SOA record MUST NOT be ANY.</t>
          <t>The Update section MAY contain any other resource records that 
             are to be added to the zone.</t>
          <t>The receiving server MUST add the SOA record and any records 
             in the Update section to the zone before serving the zone.</t>
          <t>The Additional section MUST be empty.</t>
        </section>
        
        <section anchor="addslave" title="Adding slave zones">
          <t>To add slave zones the DNS UPDATE is constructed as follows:</t>
          <t>One or more zones MUST be listed in the Zone section.
             and the ZTYPE of those zone MUST be set to NS.</t>
          <t>The Prerequisitie section MUST be empty.</t>
          <t>The Update section MUST be empty.</t>
          <t>The Additional section MUST contain at least one A or AAAA
             resource record. All A and AAAA records are used by the
             receiving server to identify the servers it should contact
             to pull the zones from.</t>
          <t>The Additional section MAY contain a TKEY record that
             the receiving server should use to authenticate itself 
             when it pulls the zones.</t>
          <t>The resource records in the Additional section MUST NOT be 
             added to the zones.</t>
        </section>

      </section>
      
      <section anchor="removezone" title="Removing zones">
        <t>To remove zones the DNS UPDATE is constructed as follows:</t>
        <t>One or more zones MUST be listed in the Zone section.
          and the ZTYPE of those zones MUST be set to NS.</t>
        <t>The Prerequisitie section MUST be empty.</t>
        <t>The Update section MUST contain a SOA record for the zone
           to be deleted and the class of the SOA record MUST be ANY.
           This use of a class of ANY to signal the removal of a zone
           matches the way that a resource record that is to be 
           deleted is identified in <xref target="RFC2136">RFC&nbsp;2136</xref></t>
        <t>The Additional section MUST be empty.</t>

      <section title="Response">
        <t>The response sent to acknowledge receipt and processing of a
           'whole of zone' operation is the same as specified for
           an 'in zone' operation in <xref target="RFC2136">RFC&nbsp;2136</xref>
           with the addition of the following specific error conditions:

            <t>When adding zones, If any of the zones listed are already 
               in the catalog of authoritative zones served by the receiving server,

               MUST ignore the entire request and return an error response with 
               RCode=YXDOMAIN.</t>
            <t>When adding zones if both the Update and Additional sections are

            <t>When adding zones if both the Update and Additional sections

            <t>When adding a master zone, if initial zone data is provided 
               and the domains names of those resource records are not within 
               the zone being added (i.e. they are 'out of bailiwick') then the 
               receiving server SHOULD ignore the entire operation and return 
               an error response with RCode=FORMERROR.</t>
            <t>When removing zones, if any of the zones listed are not in the
               catalog of zones served by the receiving server then it MUST

      <section title="Dynamic serving">
        <t>It is recognised that not all authoritative nameservers are
           capable of dynamically loading new zones to serve or dynamically
           ceasing to serve zones.  It is left to the implementor to 
           decide whether to load/unload the zones dynamically; wait for
           a server restart or to initiate a restart itself.</t>

        <t>This memo does not change the requirements for serialisation of 
           UPDATE operations the depend on each other, as specified in 
           section 3.7 of <xref target="RFC2136">RFC&nbsp;2136</xref>, which
           apply equally to 'whole of zone' operations as they do to

      </section>
      <section title="Provisioning order">
        <t>A server receiving a 'whole of zone' operation SHOULD NOT

          <list style="numbers">
            <t>When adding slave zones, rejecting the operation if
