Abstract                                                                
                                                                        
   With the reality of Internet, Autonomous Internet technology         
   in this article constructs independent autonomous extensible domain  
   name architecture and domain name hierarchy through current domain   
   name architecture, provides independent root DNS server, inner/outer 
   DNS resolution mechanism for each autonomous internet network system,
   and provides reformation and transition solution from current        
   Internet to realize autonomy even in unilateral action.

1.  Introduction                                                        
                                                                        
   Internet Domain Name System (DNS) distributes domain name and IP     
   address for the host on the Internet. DNS automatically translates   
   the domain name into IP address when user accesses Internet using    
   domain name. In current Internet domain name hierarchy, the root     
   DNS server authorizes and distributes all sub-layer DNS servers.     
   And by default it is to request the root DNS server service when any 
   other DNS servers receive a non local domain name resolution request.
   DNS supports the Internet running normally. But its central control  
   method is not suitable to autonomy and scalability and can't keep up 
   with the fast development of Internet. To national internet network, 
   owning its independent root DNS server and realize autonomy in       
   Internet is a problem not only for the cost but also for the         
   technical difficulty. It is almost impossible in current DNS         
   architecture.                                                        
                                                                        
1.1.  Specification of Requirements                                     
                                                                        
   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements 
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key   
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document  
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].                     
                                                                        
2.  Autonomous Internet DNS Design                                      
                                                                        
2.1.	 AIP DNS Design Goal                                            
                                                                        
   Based on Internet practice, autonomous internet (AIP) techinology    
   should even unilaterally transform the Internet into Autonomous      
   Internet (AIP) without protocol change, using mode change, transition
   period. In the same time, Autonomous Internet system architecture    
   designed should be safe and extensible; the reformation is the least 
   possibly and the transition is smooth and feasible.                  
                                                                        
   To achieve the goal of Internet autonomy, AIP technology will        
   construct an independent autonomous extensible domain name system and
   hierarchy based on current DNS, so that each AIP network has its own 
   independent domain name hierarchy and root DNS servers; It provides  
   the domain name resolution mechanism inner/outer AIP network system, 
   so that the internal domain name resolution is no longer via the DNS 
   outside this AIP network. Thus, the new generation Internet which    
   uses the AIP technology will become a multi-polar system and provide 
   full self-control ability to each AIP network.

2.2.	 AIP DNS Hierarchy                                              
                                                                        
   The main rules of the Autonomous Internet DNS are defined as         
   following:                                                           
                                                                        
   Rule 1: Each AIP network itself has a complete set of Domain Name    
   System, which support traditional domain name resolution within the  
   AIP.                                                                 
                                                                        
   Rule 2: Each AIP network has its own numbered name that is different 
   from the others. The numbered name is taken as the default domain    
   name suffix when the internal domain name of this AIP network is     
   cited by external AIP network. Any IP node's external domain         
   name consists of its internal domain name and its AIP network        
   default domain name suffix.                                          
                                                                        
   Rule 3: When communicate between AIP networks, the access to IP node 
   of external AIP network must use the IP node's external domain name.

   According to the goal and DNS rules of AIP, the AIP domain name      
   hierarchy of AIP can be designed as Fig. 1. In this figure, network  
   A, B and ... are AIP networks; Domain node "www.yahoo.com" in network
   B is expressed as "www.yahoo.com.B" for its external domain name.    
   At the same time, each AIP network domain name hierarchy tree adds   
   the top-level domain name "ex(i)", so as to map the other external  
   AIP network domain name hierarchy trees accessible from this AIP     
   network. When ex(i)=B, it means the other AIP network B is accessible
   from this AIP network.

   According to the AIP DNS, we can construct AIP DNS architecture show 
   as Fig. 2. Each AIP DNS has its root DNS servers, which are          
   responsible for all the DNS resolution in this AIP network. Other DNS
   servers of this AIP point to these root DNS servers by default.

Internet-Draft       DNS Extension for Autonomous Internet     June 2013
                                                                        
                                                                        
   Each AIP network is almost the same as the current Internet, and the 
   internal domain name resolution and IP node communication have not   
   any change. The only change is that the destination domain name need 
   add domain name suffix of the destination AIP network when IP nodes  
   communicate between different AIP networks. Therefore, each AIP      
   network will add a device called "AIP DNS gateway" (AIP DNS GW) to   
   support domain name resolution between AIP networks. On one hand, it 
   forwards its external DNS resolution request to the destination AIP  
   network, returns the DNS resolution result to internal requester;    
   On the other hand, it receives DNS resolution request from external  
   AIP networks, feedback the DNS resolution result to the external AIP 
   network requester, which at first it would get the internal DNS      
   resolution result according to the traditional way.                  
                                                                        
   In order to realize the transition from Internet to Autonomous       
   Internet, each partition of current Internet should first realize    
   possible self-government and gradually reduce its dependence on the  
   foreign domain names, such as COM, NET et al.                        
                                                                        
   Then to each AIP network, we can establish a new autonomous DNS, or  
   Upgrade one part of current Internet DNS (core part or non core part)
   to a new autonomous DNS.                                             
                                                                        
   Unilateral action: It is not likely the whole Internet can be        
   transformed synchronally in one time. In order not to affect existing
   domain name resolution before the Internet core part transforms into 
   an AIP network, any country can set up an AIP DNS independently and  
   connect to the Internet through the original link; or any two        
   countries in agreement can set up their AIP networks and connect to  
   each others. There is something different in the unilateral action.  
   On one hand, the upgrade work is including of new added local AIP    
   network root DNS server to construct an independent DNS, and an AIP  
   DNS GW deployment to support domain name resolution between AIP      
   networks. On the other hand, it is necessary to add a pre-transformed
   AIP DNS GW in each AIP network connecting to the Internet (core part)
   DNS instead of the original transformation requirement for Internet  
   core part. The pre-transformed AIP DNS GW would initiatively add the 
   domain name suffix to the domain name from the existing Internet     
   (core part), which is the only difference from normal AIP DNS GW.

   Within each AIP network, domain name resolution keeps traditional    
   method.

   Between AIP networks, external domain name of destination IP node    
   should be provided for domain name resolution. Assume that a host in 
   AIP network A has domain name Na1 and global IP address Ga1. Another 
   host in AIP network B has domain name Nb2=www.yahoo.com, whose       
   external domain name is www.yahoo.com.B. Fig. 3 shows the DNS query  
   procedure between AIP network A and B when host Na1 request for the  
   domain name resolution of host Nb2. This domain name resolution      
   procedure between AIP networks is described as following:

   Step 1:  Source host Na1 request for the resolution of external      
   domain name "Nb2.B", and send the query to local DNS server through

   Step 2: When receive the query, Local DNS server inquire its cache   
   and return the result. But if there is no record for the query, local
   DNS server would send query to root DNS server of local AIP network

   server IP address of queried domain (sub-domain of AIP network A's   
   root domain name, here is B, which mirrors external DNS hierarchy of 
   another AIP network B) to local DNS server, namely the IP address of

      2) When receive the query, AIP DNS GW B inquire its cache and     
      return the result. But if there is no record for the query, AIP   
      DNS GW B would get rid of the local AIP network domain name suffix
      ".B" from external domain name "Nb2.B", then send query with the  
      internal domain name "Nb2" to root DNS server of local AIP network
      B.

      server IP address again. After receive the query, this DNS server 
      inquire (its cache) and return the corresponding record or the    
      corresponding lower-level DNS server IP address.                  
                                                                        
      5) AIP DNS GW B repeats last step 4) until it finds the correct   
      record, namely the IP address Gb2 of the domain name Nb2.         
                                                                        
      6) AIP DNS GW B turns the internal domain name "Nb2" into external
      domain name "Nb2.B" in the returned result by adding local AIP    
      network domain name suffix "B", and then caches the result and    
      return the result to AIP DNS GW A.                                
                                                                        
   Step 5: AIP DNS GW A caches the returned result and return the result
   to local DNS server.                                                 
                                                                        
   Step 6: Local DNS server caches the returned result and returns the  
   result to source host Na1.                                           
                                                                        
   Therefore, host Na1 (Ga1) now can communicate with host Nb2 (Gb2)    
   after it gets the IP address of the destination host Nb2.            
                                                                        
4.  Conclusion                                                          
                                                                        
   Autonomous Internet DNS provides a technology to realize Internet    
   autonomy, which can own independent root DNS server even in          
   unilateral action. And it could be realized in high independence,    
   extensible usage, the least cost and non transition period. It is    
   hopeful to establish future autonomous extensible multi-polar        
   Internet and resolve the autonomous problem of Internet.

   The authors would like to thank everybody for their valuable opinion 
   and evaluation to this document. 
   
   Following are some FAQs:
                                       
   1).The I-D does not split the DNS at all. It plays with words by
     pretending it will allow several roots but this is not true. 
     Instead, it creates a super-root (the one which will allocate
     the AIPs, the .A and .B in the examples) and therefore just 
     displaces the (real) problems to the super-root.
    
   A:Yes, this I-D does not split the DNS at all and just make it more
     extensible and flexible! It is ridiculous rumor to say that
     anybody could and wanted to split the Internet too!
      
     Here is a super-root in this draft in mathematical sense. 
     It is the way to smoothly transfer to AIP DNS and provides 
     DNS resolution among all these AIP networks. If we provide the 
     domain name suffix, common sense is available globally. It 
     satisfies the two essentail preconditions in RFC 2826:
      -  The existence of a common symbol set, and
      -  The existence of a common semantic interpretation of these
         symbols.
    
     But in practical you can run your own root in each AIP network. 
     It provides automony and extensibility. 
    
     Technically, it is extensible choice for countries, global 
     operators, and specific internet networks such as Things of 
     Internet.
    
     Of course, there are more other applications as you need.

   2).Has the AIP technology considered the possibility of disruption 
     to Internet communications?
    
   A:This would not affect Internet communications in traditional ways. 
     Based on Internet practice, autonomous internet (AIP) techinology 
     can transform the Internet into Autonomous Internet (AIP) without 
     protocol change, using mode change, transition period.
    
     It would be more reasonable and efficient that internal domain 
     name resolution is no longer via the DNS outside this AIP network.
    
     And as described by AIP DNS rule 2 in Section 2.2, different AIP 
     network's default domain name suffix needs to be assigned by IANA,
     or other international organization, or it can be negotiated
     directly by multi-stakeholder organizations like ICANN.
         
   3).Does the AIP technology propose to use recursive DNS access 
     between AIPs? It is likely to have serious scaling issues.
     
   A:This recursive translation would happen only in local DNS server 
     and AIP DNS GW but not AIP DNS roots.
    
   4).If, for example, I am in a Chinese AIP and want to access
     www.example.com, but I want to get to the one that would be
     accessible from Brazil, do I access "www.example.com",
     "www.example.com.ex", www.example.com.br.ex", or something
     else? Is there any reason to believe that the resource
     record for www.example.com within the AIP is the same as the
     one for the same name in some other AIP? I worry about that,
     as much as anything, because international business and
     communication depends on a common understanding of resource
     records; if a vendor in country A wants to make a product or
     service available to a potential customer in country B (or
     for that matter in all countries), it gives one URI/URL to
     all of them and they all have access to it. If there is
     significant confusion at this level, sending for example
     requests intended for Google to Baidu, it will have a
     significant and negative effect on international business
     and communications. 
     
   A:AIP just provides more flexiblility and possibility to 
     international business and communications. For Google or Baidu, 
     they can apply different local URL for different country to 
     provide differentiate services as usual(for example www.google.cn,
     www.google.com.hk...); or they can apply a unified URL for all 
     countries such as www.google.com and just provide a link for 
     different countries. 
    
     In AIP,  The another additional possibility is to apply identical 
     local URL for different country to provide differentiate services.

   5).Do you agree that the economic importance of international trade 
     far outweighed the value of having an autonomous naming system...?
     
   A:I agree thoroughly that new technologies should provide more 
     flexiblility and possibility for people equally but not limit 
     the free and equal international communication right-it is the 
     soul of Internet forever!
    
   6).Could you comment on the proposal, explaining in more detail
     what you have in mind, and how (a) the service remains
     scalable, and (b) the service supports the international
     objectives of business interests that use it?
    
   A:AIP technology is so simple as it describe in this draft. 
     The prospect of future Internet would be more open and scalable 
     if we can just imagine openly!
