Internet-Draft        Routing Extension for MRT FRR        February 2013


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture]describes the architecture based
   on Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT) to provide 100% coverage for FRR
   of unicast traffic.  Protocol extensions and considerations are also
   been proposed.  The document defines the extension of routing
   protocols for fast reroute using maximally redundant trees.  The
   detailed procedures are defined based the extension.


2.  Terminology

   GADAG: Generalized ADAG - a graph that is the combination of the
   ADAGs of all blocks.

   Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT): A pair of trees where the path from
   any node X to the root R along the first tree and the path from the
   same node X to the root along the second tree share the minimum
   number of nodes and the minimum number of links.  Each such shared
   node is a cut-vertex.  Any shared links are cut-links.  Any RT is an
   MRT but many MRTs are not RTs.


3.  MRT-FRR TLV Format

3.1.  IS-IS MRT-FRR Sub-TLV Format

   IS-IS MRT FRR sub-TLV is defined to advertise necessary information
   related with MRT FRR.  It is an optional sub-TLV which can be
   advertised in the router capability TLV([RFC4971]) .  The information
   has only level-wide scope.  If there is no MRT FRR sub-TLV
   advertised, that router should be seen as that it does not support
   MRT FRR.

   The IS-IS MRT FRR sub-TLV is composed of 1 octet for the type, 1
   octet specifying the TLV length and a value field.  The IS-IS MRT FRR
   sub-TLV format (Figure 1) is as follows:

   TYPE: TBD

   LENGTH: 12

   router for being used as the GADAG root of its island.  A GADAG root
   is elected from the set of routers with the highest priority; ties
   are broken based upon highest System ID.  The sensitivity of the MRT
   Algorithms to GADAG root selection is still being evaluated.  This
   provides the network operator with a knob to force particular GADAG
   root selection.

3.2.  OSPF MRT FRR TLV Format

   OSPF MRT FRR TLV is defined to advertise necessary information
   related with MRT FRR.  It is an optional TLV which can be advertised
   in the OSPF router information LSA([RFC4970]) .  The information has
   only area-wide scope.  If there is no MRT FRR TLV advertised, that
   router should be seen as that it does not support MRT FRR.

   The OSPF MRT FRR TLV has the following format:

   TYPE: TBD

   LENGTH: 12

4.  Elements of Procedure

4.1.  IS-IS

4.1.1.  Sending

   MRT FRR sub-TLV is encapsulated in the Router Capability TLV and
   advertised through LSP PDU in the level-wide.  MRT FRR sub-TLV is an
   optional TLV.  If the router cannot support MRT FRR, it MUST NOT send
   the sub-TLV.  Since the advertisement scope of the MRT sub-TLV is
   level-wide, when it is advertised the D-Bit and S-Bit of the Router
   Capability TLV MUST be set as 0.  If other sub-TLVs in the Router
   Capability TLV need different values for the two bits, there MUST be
   an independent Router Capability TLV for the MRT FRR sub-TLV.

   If the router can support multiple MRT FRR instances, there can be
   multiple MRT FRR sub-TLVs to be advertised.  In these sub-TLVs and

Internet-Draft        Routing Extension for MRT FRR        February 2013


   there are different primary MT-IDs and associated Red/Blue MT-IDs.
   MT-IDs advertised by the MRT FRR sub-TLV MUST NOT be the reserved
   values for MT-ID([RFC5120]).  In one MRT FRR sub-TLV, the Blue MT-ID
   MUST be different from the Red MT-ID.

   MRT FRR sub-TLV MUST advertise the actual MRT capabilities, MRT
   algorithms and MRT forwarding mechanisms that the router can support.
   The corresponding bit MUST be set as 1 if it is supported.
   Otherwise, it MUST be set as 0.

   GADAG Root Election Priority is a 16-bit unsigned integer which
   default value is set to 0x8000.  The higher numerical value means the
   higher priority.  GADAG Root Election is ordered with the priority
   and the IS-IS system ID is used as the tiebreaker.  That is, if the
   priority is the same, the router with higher IS-IS system ID will be
   chosen.  When a new MRT-capable router is added and its priority is
   higher than the current root, the MRT island will recalculate GADAG
   and new Blue/Red next hops for each prefix in the primary topology.
   If the current root fails, the new root will be re-elected and MRT
   calculation will be done according to the new root.  Routers that are
   marked as overloaded([RFC3787]) is not qualified as candidate for
   root selection.

   When MRT related information is changed in the router or existing
   IS-IS LSP mechanisms are triggered for refresh or update, MRT sub-TLV
   MUST be advertised with LSP.

4.1.2.  Receiving

   MRT capability SHOULD NOT affect the peer setup and the routing
   calculation of the default SPF topology.

   MRT FRR sub-TLV should be validated like other sub-TLVs when
   received.  MRT FRR sub-TLV is also taken for the checksum calculation
   and authentication.

   If MRT FRR sub-TLV is received and the D-Bit and S-Bit of the router
   capability TLV may be not 0, MRT FRR sub-TLV MUST NOT leak to other
   levels.  If the receiver router can not support MRT, it MUST ignore
   MRT FRR sub-TLV.

   If multiple MRT FRR sub-TLVs are received in one LSP, it means
   multiple MRT instances are supported by the sender router.  If the
   MT-ID conflict is found in the multiple MRT FRR sub-TLVs, the
   associated sub-TLVs MUST be ignored.

   The MRT capability field, the MRT algorithm field and the MRT
   forwarding mechanism field MUST NOT be 0.  If one of these field is

Internet-Draft        Routing Extension for MRT FRR        February 2013


   0, the sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

   According to the group {primary MT-ID, the Red MRT MT-ID and the Blue
   MRT MT-ID} identified by the received MRT FRR sub-TLV, the receiver
   router will take the MRT capability for intersection.  If there is no
   intersection, the router will stop processing for the group.  For the
   MRT algorithm, the receiver router will also take it for
   intersection.  If there is no intersection, the router will stop
   processing.  For the MRT forwarding mechanism, the receiver router
   not only check if there is intersection, but also check if the
   intersection found can satisfy the requirement of the MRT capability
   intersection.

   After the intersection is found for the group {primary MT-ID, the Red
   MRT MT-ID and the Blue MRT MT-ID}, the receiver router will elect the
   root node according to the GADAG Root Election Priority.  If there
   are updates about the priority for existing MRT FRR sub-TLV or the
   new MRT FRR sub-TLV is received or the current root node fails, the
   receiver will recalculate GADAG and new Blue/Red next hops for each
   prefix in the primary topology.

4.2.  OSPF

4.2.1.  Sending

   MRT FRR TLV is encapsulated in the router information LSA whose
   opaque type is 10 advertised in the area-wide.  MRT FRR TLV is an
   optional TLV.  If the router can not support MRT FRR, it MUST NOT
   send the TLV.

   If the router can support multiple MRT FRR instances, there can be
   multiple MRT FRR TLVs to be advertised.  In these TLVs and there are
   different primary MT-IDs and associated Red/Blue MT-IDs.  MT-IDs
   advertised by the MRT FRR TLV MUST NOT be the reserved values for
   MT-ID([RFC4915]).  In one MRT FRR TLV, the Blue MT-ID MUST be
   different from the Red MT-ID.

   MRT FRR TLV MUST advertise the actual MRT capabilities, MRT
   algorithms and MRT forwarding mechanisms that the router can support.
   The corresponding bit MUST be set as 1 if it is supported.
   Otherwise, it MUST be set 0.

   GADAG Root Election Priority is a 16-bit unsigned integer which
   default value is set to 0x8000.  The higher numerical value means the
   higher priority.  GADAG Root Election is ordered with the priority
   and the OSPF Router ID is used as the tiebreaker.  That is, if the
   priority is the same, the router with higher OSPF Router ID will be
   chosen.  When a new MRT-capable router is added and its priority is

   higher than the current root, the MRT island will recalculate GADAG
   and new Blue/Red next hops for each prefix in the primary topology.
   If the current root fails, the new root will be re-elected and MRT
   calculation will be done according to the new root.  Routers that are
   marked as stub router([RFC3137]) are not qualified as candidate for
   root selection.

   When MRT related information is changed in the router or existing
   OSPF LSA mechanisms are triggered for refresh or update, MRT TLV MUST
   be advertised with LSA.

4.2.2.  Receiving

   MRT capability SHOULD NOT affect the neighbor setup and the routing
   calculation of the default SPF topology.

   MRT FRR TLV should be validated like other TLVs when received.  MRT
   FRR TLV is also taken for the checksum calculation and
   authentication.

   The MRT capability field, the MRT algorithm field and the MRT
   forwarding mechanism field MUST NOT be 0.  If one of these field is
   0, the TLV MUST be ignored.

   According to the group {primary MT-ID, the Red MRT MT-ID and the Blue
   MRT MT-ID} identified by the received MRT FRR TLV, the receiver
   router will take the MRT capability for intersection.  If there is no
   intersection, the router will stop processing for the group.  For the
   MRT algorithm, the receiver router will also take it for
   intersection.  If there is no intersection, the router will stop
   processing.  For the MRT forwarding mechanism, the receiver router
   not only check if there is intersection, but also check if the
   intersection found can satisfy the requirement of the MRT capability
   intersection.

   After the intersection is found for the group {primary MT-ID, the Red
   MRT MT-ID and the Blue MRT MT-ID}, the receiver router will elect the
   root node according to the GADAG Root Election Priority.  If there
   are updates about the priority for existing MRT FRR TLV or the new
   MRT FRR TLV is received ro the current root node fails, the receiver
   will recalculate GADAG and new Blue/Red next hops for each prefix in
   the primary topology.


5.  Backward Compatibility

   The MRT FRR TLVs defined in this document do not introduce any
   interoperability issue.  For OSPF, a router not supporting the MRT

   FRR TLV SHOULD just silently ignore the TLV as specified in
   [RFC2370].  For an IS-IS, a router not supporting the MRT FRR sub-TLV
   SHOULD just silently ignore the sub-TLV.


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  IS-IS

   This document introduces a new sub-TLV for IS-IS.  The type is to be
   determined by IANA.

6.2.  OSPF

   This document introduces a new TLV for OSPF.  The type is to be
   determined by IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   This routing extension is not currently believed to introduce new
   security concerns.
