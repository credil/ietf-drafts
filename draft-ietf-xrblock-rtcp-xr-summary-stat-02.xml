      <t>
        This document defines three RTP Control Protcol (RTCP) Extended
        Report (XR) Blocks and associated SDP parameters that allow the
        reporting of loss, duplication and discard summary statistics metrics
        in a range of RTP applications.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This draft defines three new block types to augment those defined in
        Freidman, et al.&nbsp;<xref target="RFC3611"></xref> for use in a range of RTP
        applications.
      </t>

      <t>
        The first two block types support the reporting of burst gap loss/
        discard summary statistics including packet loss/discard proportion,
        mean and variance and belong to the class of transport-related end
        system metrics defined in
        Wu, Hunt &amp; Arden <xref target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-monarch"></xref>. These two
        blocks are intended to be used in conjunction with information from the
        Burst Gap Loss metric block or Burst Gap Discard metric block, and on
        which these two block therefore depend.  The metrics in the
        Burst Gap Loss block or Burst Gap Discard metric block can be used
        independently of the metrics defined in the first two blocks, however.
        These two
        blocks reflect transient IP problems that affect user experience and can
        be used to influence sender strategies to mitigate the problem.
      </t>

      <t>
        To form an accurate assessment of users' quality of experience, it is
        therefore necessary to know not just overall rates of packet
        loss/discard, but also which frame types were affected. The third block
        supports the reporting of detailed statistics for each frame type,
        including the number of frames received, lost and discarded of each frame type
        in the Group of Pictures (GOP) and additional data allowing the
        calculation of statistical parameters (e.g.,the proportion of each frame
        type impaired by packet loss and discard). The metrics defined in this
        block belong to the class of application layer metrics defined in
        Wu, Hunt &amp; Arden <xref target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-monarch"></xref>.

                Packets Expected is calculated as the difference between

                Note that if the metric is to be calculated on

                number with the binary point at the left edge of the field. This

                difference between Packets Expected and Total Packets expected

                (number of

                <xref target="I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-discard"></xref>
                and Packets Expected is calculated as
                the difference between "extended last sequence number" and
                "extended first sequence number" (Interval or Cumulative)
                provided in the Measurement Information block

                packets discarded due to both early and late arrival; otherwise, “the number of packet
