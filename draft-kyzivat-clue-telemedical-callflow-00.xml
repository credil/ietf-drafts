This is the beginning of an example call flow for an instantiation of the use case 
described in <xref target="I-D.xiao-clue-telemedical-use-case">the telemedical use case</xref>.
More detail will be added later.

			<t>
This is a first cut at the call flow. So far it only includes the ladder diagram showing the exchange of SIP and CLUE messages.
The content of those messages will be added later. 
Before doing that it will be useful to agree on at least one acceptable sequence of messages to realize this use case.

		<section title="Scenario being illustrated">
			<t>
The case considered here consists of one surgery room, one remote expert, and one remote classroom, connected by an MCU.
The classroom connects first and waits until the surgery begins. 
The surgery room connects second. At that point the classroom and surgery are joined by the MCU.
The expert joins last.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Assumptions">
			<t>
I have made an assumption here that the SDP in the initial offer on each leg is "vanilla" audio/video 
plus an m-line for the CLUE signaling channel. 
Once it is verified that both sides support CLUE, and advertisements and configurations have been exchanged,
another offer/answer exchange is done to accommodate what has been configured. 
			</t>
			<t>
There are other strategies that could be used here:
                        <list style='symbols'>
			    <t>
The initial O/A could have a more expansive SDP that is sufficient to accommodate common CLUE sessions.
If to, then another O/A may not be needed after configurations are exchanged.
			    </t>
			    <t>
There could be a requirement that an advertisement cannot be sent until SDP has been negotiated
that is sufficient for any configurations of that advertisement that might be chosen.
			    </t>
			    <t>
There could be a requirement that a configuration cannot be requested until SDP has been negotiated
that is sufficient to accommodate that configuration as well as the configuration in effect in the
other direction.
			    </t>
                        </list>

There are some issues with the ladder diagram above due to the tool I've used to generate it.
The CLUE messages are shown with "--->" rather than "...>" because the tool can't do the latter.

There is an issue with SDP O/A that I have never seen discussed: when you send a new O/A that updates a session,
how do you know when those changes have taken effect? 
How long must you continue to support media according to the prior negotiated SDP? 
With CLUE we have enlarged that problem:
				</t>
				<list style='symbols'>
					<t>
Must an Advertisement be consistent with the currently negotiated SDP?
					</t>
					<t>
Must a Configuration message be consistent with the currently negotiated SDP?
					</t>
					<t>
Which side is responsible for initiating a new O/A when the old one is insufficient to support
the advertisement(s) and configuration(s)?
					</t>
					<t>
How long must an old advertisement be supported after a new one is sent?
What if the you never get a Configure message back in response to the new advertisement
because the other end prefers to keep receiving what it currently getting.
(Does that mean that a new advertisement must always encompass any configurations currently in effect?)
					</t>
					<t>
Can a Configure message reference an Advertisement other than the most recently sent one?
Is it permissible to reject such a request?
					</t>
