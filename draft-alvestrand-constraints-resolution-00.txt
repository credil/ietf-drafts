Internet-Draft           Resolution Constraints              August 2012


1.  Introduction

   There are a number of scenarios where it's useful for a WebRTC
   application to indicate to the WebRTC implementation in the supported
   browser what the desired characteristics of a video stream are.
   These include, but are not limited to:

   o  Specifying a minimum desired resolution for a given application,
      in order to control the user experience or resource tradeoffs made
      by the browser to favour a particular stream

   o  Specifying a maximum desired resolution for a given stream, in
      order to save some resource (bandwidth, CPU....), possibly outside
      of the browser where the browser can't tell that it's exceeding a
      constraint

   o  Specifying resolutions that are a reasonable fit for the current
      usage of the video stream, for instance fitting with the number of
      pixels available on the part of a device's display surface that is
      devoted to displaying this video stream

   o  Specifying the shape of a video stream, in order to fit the video
      onto a display surface without the need for black bars or image
      distortion

   Similar considerations apply for framerate.

1.1.  Disposition of this text

   This draft is written in order to get something specific out to refer
   to during spec-writing and implementation.  The text may eventually
   get merged into either the IETF document on SDP usage by RTCWEB, or
   the W3C WEBRTC document on PeerConnection.


2.  Usage considerations

   These constraints are usable in several places:

   o  As constraints to the getUserMedia call
      [W3C.WD-mediacapture-streams-20120628], where they serve to guide
      the configuration of the camera obtained, and may influence the
      choice of camera.

   o  As constraints to the addStream call on a PeerConnection
      [W3C.WD-webrtc-20120821], where they serve to guide the
      configuration of the codec that encodes the video content for
      transmission.

Internet-Draft           Resolution Constraints              August 2012


   o  As constraints applied to an existing local video stream using the
      "change constraints" API, where it may cause the video engine to
      reconfigure the device or codec for that particular stream.

   o  As constraints applied to an incoming video stream using the
      "change constrains" API on a MediaStreamTrack, where it serves to
      inform the video engine about the desirable properties of the
      video track, which may lead to the video engine choosing to
      reencode the video and/or signal a remote video source that it
      wishes certain constraints to be put in place.

   All of the constraints may be meaningful in both "mandatory" and
   "optional" forms.


3.  Usage examples

   See Section 4 for the actual definition of the constraints used here.

3.1.  Examples with GetUserMedia

   A constraint saying that we absolutely must have a minimum resolution
   of 1024x768:

   getUserMedia({
      video: { mandatory: { minWidth: 1024, minHeight: 768 } }
   }, successCallback, errorCallback);



   A constraint saying that we'd prefer 60 frames per second, if
   available, and if we can get that, we'd like to limit the max
   resolution, but in all cases, the screen must be clamped to a 4:3
   aspect ratio - 16:9 or odd aspect ratios are not acceptable to this
   application:

   getUserMedia({
      video: {
        mandatory: { minAspectRatio: 1.333, maxAspectRatio: 1.334 },
        optional [
          { minFrameRate: 60 },
          { maxWidth: 640 },
          { maxHeigth: 480 }
        ]
      }
   }, successCallback, errorCallback);

3.2.  Possible SDP mappings

   This document does not specify or constrain how constraints get
   reflected into SDP (if they do); that's an implementor decision.

   The examples below are thought exercises, based on
   [I-D.lennox-mmusic-sdp-source-selection] and
   [I-D.alvestrand-rtcweb-resolution].

   An optional constraint has been applied to an incoming stream where
   both upper and lower are constrained to 320x200.  The stream has been
   assigned to a hardware video decoder that can decode most resolutions
   up to 1024x768, in any aspect ratio, but only if all divisions are
   divisible by 4.  The incoming stream has SSRC 1234.

   Line breaks are added for readability.

   m=video
   a=remote-ssrc:1234 imageattr:* [x=320,y=200,q=1.0] \
                     [x=[120:4:1024],y=[100:4:768],q=0.2]





4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register constraints in the "RTCWeb
   Media Constraints" registry created by
   [I-D.burnett-rtcweb-constraints-registry].  NOTE: The registrations
   assume that this document is updated to no longer have "video" as
   part of the name, but have "video" as a field-of-use in the
   registration.

   The definitions of width, height and aspect ratio are taken from
   [RFC6236].

   o  MinWidth - valid for video.  Corresponds to the "x" value (pixel
      count) from RFC 6236.  Only integer values are valid.

   o  MaxWidth - valid for video.  Definition as for MinWidth.

   o  MinHeight - valid for video.  Corresponds to the "y" value (pixel
      count) from RFC 6236.  Only integer values are valid.

   o  MaxHeight - valid for video.  Definition as for MinHeight.

Internet-Draft           Resolution Constraints              August 2012


   o  MinAspectRatio - valid for video.  Corresponds to the "par"
      (picture aspect ratio), with "sar" set to 1.0.  A 4:3 format
      display corresponds to an AspectRatio of 1.3333.  Floating point
      values are valid.

   o  MaxAspectRatio - valid for video.  Definition as for
      MinAspectRatio.

   o  MinFramerate - valid for video.  Corresponds to the framerate
      defined in [RFC4566], the "a=framerate" attribute.

   o  MaxFramerate - valid for video.  Definition as for MinFramerate.

   The contact person is Harald Alvestrand <hta@google.com>.

   Change control for the registration is with the IETF, as designated
   by the IESG.

   Note that MinFramerate defines a lower bound for the a=framerate
   attribute, which is itself defined as an upper limit; this means that
   even if a high framerate is negotiated, the actual framerate used may
   be lower due to temporary considerations (for instance CPU or
   bandwidth, or simply lack of movement in the picture).


5.  Security Considerations

   No security considerations particular to these specific constraints
   have so far been identified.


6.  Acknowledgements

   RTCWEB WG and the W3C WEBRTC WG for strongly influencing this memo.
