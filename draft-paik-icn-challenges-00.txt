1.  Introduction

   The objective of ICN RG is to produce documents describing different
   approaches, problem statement, and reference scenario.  One of the
   ICN approaches is CCN (Content-Centric Networking).

   This document provides the key benefits and research challenges of
   CCN.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined.

   o Information-Centric Networking:  Information-Centric Networking
      (ICN) is a new networking paradigm that shifts the emphasis from
      endpoints to addressing content directly, thereby enabling simple,
      robust and efficient content distribution in the network.

   o Content-Centric Networking:  Content-Centric Networking (CCN), is a
      new network architecture that embraces ICN principles of direct
      content addressing.  CCN architecture builds up on the
      fundamentals of content, names and security.

   o Content Delivery Network:  CDN refers to Content Delivery/
      Distribution Network.  This document distinguishes CCN from CDN as
      follows: CCN protocol is a network layer architecture while CDN is
      a content distribution system that operates as an application
      layer service in today's Internet architecture.

   o Interest:  Interest is a CCN packet type that is sent request
      content in a CCN network.

   o Content Object:  In a CCN network, content that is requested by a
      client travels back in the form of a content object.


3.  Technical Features

   The basic CCN operation mechanism is interest/content object
   exchange.  Nodes wishing to receive content issue an Interest with a
   prefix describing the data (content) they desire.  These interest
   packets are routed towards known content sources or producers, and as
   they are routed through the network any intermediate node can satisfy

   the interest with matching content objects from its cache.  Each
   individual content object is retrieved using a single interest.  The
   content returned is verified to be sure it is what was asked for,
   unmodified and published by a trusted publisher.

   The key features of CCN include directly named content, location
   independence, and content-level protection.

3.1.  Directly Named Content

   In CCN, content is named and addressed directly unlike today networks
   where the emphasis is on naming end hosts.  Named content travels as
   content objects in a CCN network.  Content objects can be thought of
   as named data packets.

3.2.  Location Independence

   CCN decouples content name from content location.  Thus, there is no
   need to translate from the desired content to a location in the
   network.  This feature allows CCN to take advantage of widespread
   caches and storage deployed in the network.

3.3.  Content-Protection

   Individual pieces of content are protected rather than securing the
   connection between the end hosts as implemented in today's Internet.
   Each content object is signed by its publisher and can optionally be
   encrypted.  This feature of protecting individual content objects
   allows content to be cached at any location in the network.


4.  Benefits

   The new CCN architecture offers several significant benefits with
   respect to performance, cost, and ease of new application development
   and deployment as compared to traditional networks in use today.  We
   address each of these in more detail in the rest of this section.

4.1.  Network Efficiency and Performance

   Removing the dependency on location-based content retrieval allows
   CCN to reduce resource consumption and make the network utilization
   more efficient through caching.  Content requestors ask for the
   content by name, and any CCN node along the path from the requestor
   to the publisher that has a matching content object in its cache can
   satisfy the request.

   Further, CCN nodes are not restricted to contacting a single source

Internet-Draft   Benefits of Content-Centric Networking        July 2012


   to receive content.  They may request content from a set of sources,
   and can also choose the most responsive content source in order to
   minimize content retrieval times.

4.2.  Security

   CCN focuses on securing individual content pieces - each content
   object is digitally signed and contains information about its
   publisher.  Content objects can optionally be encrypted as well.  The
   security model in CCN allows applications and users to determine
   which publishers to trust.  Users can detect if an object has been
   modified or tampered by a malicious party before it was delivered and
   also be sure the publisher is one that it trusts to produce non-
   malicious content.

   Unlike today's networks that enforce security by securing the path
   through which unsecured content travels, CCN allows data consumers to
   trust the data independently of the path through which it was
   obtained.

   Additionally, by incorporating network-layer security for individual
   content pieces, CCN frees applications and services from focusing on
   securing content.  This feature significantly reduces the development
   cost as well as complexity of most applications, including security-
   critical applications, such as banking services.

4.3.  CAPEX and OPEX

   CCN reduces CAPEX and OPEX for network operators.

   As described in Section 4.1, CCN makes better utilization of the
   network and reduces CAPEX on bandwidth by reducing redundant traffic
   and peak-rate traffic.

   Secondly, CCN reduces OPEX by providing automatic management of cache
   with pull model of delivery.  Thus, data automatically goes to where
   it is requested.  In comparison, CDN typically require manual
   management of cache with push model where a content producer needs to
   anticipate which contents will be highly popular, as well as which
   clients will request a particular content, and push the desired data
   closest to those clients.

   Thirdly, CCN reduces OPEX by providing easy deployment of cache from
   the viewpoint of network topology.  CCN allows content to cached
   closer to the users, including at CCN nodes at the network edge.  CCN
   caches can also be deployed on mobile devices and inside a service
   provider's network.  In contrast, CDN servers are typically topology-
   restricted and can be deployed only in certain locations such as

   peering points.

   Fourthly, CCN reduces OPEX by providing easy management and
   configuration.  CCN does not need additional protocols to optimize
   the path, e.g., ALTO (Application Layer Traffic Optimization)
   protocol.  Path optimization and keeping track of dynamic network
   conditions happens at the strategy layer in CCN - CCN has inherent
   network support to route around bottleneck links as well as network
   failures.

   Finally, CCN reduces OPEX by providing the same path for content
   requests (forward path) and response (reverse path), i.e., content
   objects follow the reverse of the Interest path.  This aspect really
   helps in traffic engineering (in today's Internet architecture
   forward and reverse packet paths need not be the same), e.g., QoS is
   easier to implement in CCN networks.
