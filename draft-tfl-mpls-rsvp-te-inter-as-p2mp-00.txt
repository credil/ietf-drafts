Internet-Draft  RSVP-TE Extensions for inter-AS P2MP Path  December 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4875] describes extensions to RSVP-TE protocol for building a
   P2MP TE LSP in MPLS/GMPLS network environment.  However, [RFC4875]
   doesn't specify path selecting problem of inter-AS P2MP TE LSP.  In
   inter-AS scenario, node maybe have not topology and resources of the
   whole network, so it may be not able to compute an inter-AS P2MP TE
   LSP.

   This document specifies an inter-AS P2MP path bulding method based on
   extentions to RSVP-TE Protocol.  Inter-AS P2MP LSP is comprised of
   multiple source-to-leaf(S2L) sub-LSPS, which are set up between the
   ingress and egress LSRs located in different ASes.

3.  Procedures Overview

3.1.  Overview

   This document specifies an inter-AS P2MP path bulding method using
   RSVP-TE Protocol Extension.  Using this method, the ingress node will
   start the intra-AS P2MP TE LSP building process, and distribute the
   PATH message according to RSVP-TE protocol extension specified in
   [RFC4875].  Egress ASBRs will transmit the PATH request message of a
   P2MP TE LSP to the ingress ASBRs of the neighbor ASes, which will
   processes the message as an request for intra-AS P2MP TE LSP building
   request, and continuing the building process.  Following text
   describes this mechanism.

   1.  Ingress node treats egress ASBRs and leaf nodes in the same AS as
       leaf nodes of the intra-AS P2MP tree, and computes P2MP path to
       those leaf nodes..  Since it is intra-AS path computation,
       current existing mature solutions could be used here.

   2.  Ingress node uses RSVP-TE protocol to construct Path messages and
       send them through the path that has been computed to leaf nodes
       in the same AS.  The Path message should contain path information
       to leaf nodes and cost information of S2L sub-LSPs.

   3.  When egress ASBR node receives path request message, it should
       first decide whether or not cost value of path in the message is
       smaller than that exists on the node.  If yes, egress ASBR node
       should save the Path message and update cost value, then transmit
       the Path message to ingress ASBR nodes of downstream neighbor AS.
       Otherwise, egress ASBR node should desert the Path message
       without any process.

   4.  When ingress ASBR node of neighbor AS receives Path message, it
       should first decide whether or not cost value of path in the
       message is smaller than that exists on the node.  If yes, ingress
       ASBR node should save the later received path message and compute
       path to all egress ASBRs and leaf nodes in the same AS, after
       computation is finished, ingress node construct Path messages and
       send them through the path that has been computed to leaf nodes
       in the same AS.  This is similar to step 1 and 2.

   5.  When egress node receives Path message, it should first decide
       whether or not cost value of path in the message is smaller than
       that exists on the node, if yes, then it should further decide
       the interface that received the newly path request message is not
       the same interface that has been used to reply, if yes, egress
       node should save the newly Path message, waits for a Delay time
       and then reserves resources and assigns label, replies Resv

       message to corresponding upstream node.

   6.  Resv message passes through the path that Path message used,
       reaches ingress ASBR node and upstream neighbor AS's egress ASBR
       node, those ASBR nodes need reserve resources, assign label for
       upstream node, and transmit new Resv message to upstream node.

   7.  Ingress node receives Resv message, configures received label to
       the node.  Then, an inter-AS S2L sub-LSP for one leaf node is set
       up.

3.2.  Egress ASBR Node

   When egress ASBR receivers PATH messages, it should process the
   message according to following procedures.

   It should first decide whether or not the cost value of S2L sub-LSP
   in the messages is smaller than the pre-saved one. if yes, egress
   ASBR node should desert the Path message without any further process.
   Otherwise, egress ASBR must replace the pre-saved PATH request
   messages with the newly received messages. if links that connect to
   these ingress ASBR nodes could satisfy TE attributions, egress ASBR
   node will transmit Path message to these ingress ASBR nodes.  The
   Path message treats egress ASBR node as root and ingress ASBR node of
   next neighbor AS as leaf node, and cost value of path in the Path
   message equals cost value of path in the Path message that egress
   ASBR node received plus cost value of the link between egress ASBR
   node and ingress ASBR node.

   When Egress ASBR receives Resv message, it should process the message
   according to following procedures.

   If it has replied the corresponding P2MP TE LSP, it only needs to
   configure label to the node.  If not, it should also reserve
   resources and assign label, construct new Resv message and reply Resv
   message to corresponding upstream node.  If this node receives more
   than one Resv messages, it should merge flow descriptors of those
   messages and reply single Resv message to corresponding upstream
   node.

3.3.  Ingress ASBR Node

   Ingress ASBR node receives Path message, it should process the
   message according to following procedures.

   It should first decide whether or not cost value of path in the
   message isn't smaller than that exists on the node, if yes, ingress
   ASBR node should desert the path message without any further process.

   Otherwise, ingress ASBR node should save the Path message.  If this
   is first Path message received, ingress ASBR node would compute
   optimal multicast tree between it and every egress ASBR node or
   egress PE node in the same AS; if this is not the first message
   received, ingress ASBR node could use computation result which has
   been computed.  Then, ingress ASBR node computes cost value of path
   between it and each egress ASBR node or egress PE node, constructs
   new Path message, sends the message to every egress ASBR node and
   egress PE node.

   Ingress ASBR node receives Resv message, it should process the
   message according to following procedures.

   If it has replied the corresponding P2MP TE LSP, it only needs to
   configure label to the node.  If not, it should also reserve
   resources and assign label, construct new Resv message and reply Resv
   message to corresponding egress ASBR node of upstream neighbor AS.
   If this node receives more than one Resv messages, it should merge
   flow descriptors of those messages and reply single Resv message to
   corresponding egress ASBR node of upstream neighbor AS.

3.4.  Transit Node

   Transit node receives Path message, it should process the message
   according to following procedures.

   It should first decide whether or not cost value of path in the
   message isn't smaller than that exists on the node, if yes, Transit
   node should desert the path message without any further process.
   Otherwise, transit node should update the message that saved on the
   node, and analyze the message and process it according to procedures
   defined in RFC4875, then transmit it to downstream node.

   Transit node receives Resv message, it should process the message
   according to following procedures.

   If it has replied the corresponding P2MP TE LSP, it only needs to
   configure label to the node.  If not, it should also reserve
   resources and assign label, construct new Resv message and reply Resv
   message to corresponding upstream node.  If this node receives more
   than one Resv messages, it should merge flow descriptors of those
   messages and reply single Resv message to corresponding upstream
   node.

3.5.  Leaf Node

   Leaf node receives Path message, it should process the message
   according to following procedures.

   Leaf node should first decide whether or not this is the first
   message received, if yes, leaf node should start timer.

   If this isn't the first message, and timer doesn't expire, leaf node
   should decide if cost value of path in the message is smaller than
   that exists on the node, if yes, leaf node should update the message
   that saved on the node.  If cost value in the message is not smaller,
   leaf node should desert the message.

   If this is not the first message but timer expires, leaf node should
   desert the message.

   If timer expires, leaf node should reserve resources and assign
   label, and reply Resv message to upstream node.

4.  Messages Format

4.1.  Path Message

   Path message is used to transmit path setup request, [RFC4875] gives
   a detailed definition.  This document gives extensions to Path
   message, and Path message could also transmit cost or hops of path
   which is from root node to certain transit node or leaf node.  The
   format of Path message is as follows.

     <Path Message> ::= <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                           [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>] ...]
                           [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                           <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                           <TIME_VALUES>

                           [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                           <sender descriptor>
                           [<S2L sub-LSP descriptor list>]

    <S2L sub-LSP descriptor list> ::= <S2L sub-LSP descriptor>
                           [ <S2L sub-LSP descriptor list> ]


    <S2L sub-LSP descriptor> ::= <S2L_SUB_LSP>
                                 <S2L_SUB_LSP_COST>|     <S2L_SUB_LSP_HOPS>
                            [ <P2MP SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]


   In each <S2L sub-LSP descriptor> object, there is a
   <S2L_SUB_LSP_COST> or <S2L_SUB_LSP_HOPS> object, they are used to
   describe cost of a path.

4.2.  Resv message

   Resv message is used to reply Path message and assign label for
   upstream node, [RFC4875] gives a detailed definition.  This document
   gives extentions to Resv message, and Resv message could also
   transmit cost or hops of path which is from root node to leaf node.
   The format of Resv message is as follows.

   <S2L sub-LSP descriptor> ; <S2L_SUB_LSP_COST> and <S2L_SUB_LSP_HOPS>
   objects are used to describe cost of a path.  The root of P2MP LSP
   could know cost value of path to each leaf node through those objects
   that contained in Resv message.
