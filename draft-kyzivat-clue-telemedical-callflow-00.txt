Internet-Draft     CLUE Telemedical Use Case Callflow     September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This is a first cut at the call flow.  So far it only includes the
   ladder diagram showing the exchange of SIP and CLUE messages.  The
   content of those messages will be added later.  Before doing that it
   will be useful to agree on at least one acceptable sequence of
   messages to realize this use case.


2.  Scenario being illustrated

   The case considered here consists of one surgery room, one remote
   expert, and one remote classroom, connected by an MCU.  The classroom
   connects first and waits until the surgery begins.  The surgery room
   connects second.  At that point the classroom and surgery are joined
   by the MCU.  The expert joins last.


3.  Assumptions

   I have made an assumption here that the SDP in the initial offer on
   each leg is "vanilla" audio/video plus an m-line for the CLUE
   signaling channel.  Once it is verified that both sides support CLUE,
   and advertisements and configurations have been exchanged, another
   offer/answer exchange is done to accommodate what has been
   configured.

   There are other strategies that could be used here:
   o  The initial O/A could have a more expansive SDP that is sufficient
      to accommodate common CLUE sessions.  If to, then another O/A may
      not be needed after configurations are exchanged.
   o  There could be a requirement that an advertisement cannot be sent
      until SDP has been negotiated that is sufficient for any
      configurations of that advertisement that might be chosen.
   o  There could be a requirement that a configuration cannot be
      requested until SDP has been negotiated that is sufficient to
      accommodate that configuration as well as the configuration in
      effect in the other direction.

Internet-Draft     CLUE Telemedical Use Case Callflow     September 2012


4.1.  Comments

   There are some issues with the ladder diagram above due to the tool
   I've used to generate it.  The CLUE messages are shown with "--->"
   rather than "...>" because the tool can't do the latter.

   There is an issue with SDP O/A that I have never seen discussed: when
   you send a new O/A that updates a session, how do you know when those
   changes have taken effect?  How long must you continue to support
   media according to the prior negotiated SDP?  With CLUE we have
   enlarged that problem:
   o  Must an Advertisement be consistent with the currently negotiated
      SDP?
   o  Must a Configuration message be consistent with the currently
      negotiated SDP?
   o  Which side is responsible for initiating a new O/A when the old
      one is insufficient to support the advertisement(s) and
      configuration(s)?
   o  How long must an old advertisement be supported after a new one is
      sent?  What if the you never get a Configure message back in
      response to the new advertisement because the other end prefers to
      keep receiving what it currently getting.  (Does that mean that a
      new advertisement must always encompass any configurations
      currently in effect?)
   o  Can a Configure message reference an Advertisement other than the
      most recently sent one?  Is it permissible to reject such a
      request?
