         Supporting Shared Mesh Protection in MPLS-TP Networks
                draft-pan-shared-mesh-protection-05.txt

Abstract

   Shared mesh protection is a common protection and recovery mechanism
   in transport networks, where multiple paths can share the same set of
   network resources for protection purposes.

   In the context of MPLS-TP, it has been explicitly requested as a part
   of the overall solution (Req. 67, 68 and 69 in RFC5654 [RFC5654]).

   It's important to note that each MPLS-TP LSP may be associated with
   transport network resources.  In event of network failure, it may
   require explicit activation on the protecting paths before switching
   user traffic over.

   In this memo, we define a lightweight signaling mechanism for
   protecting path activation in shared mesh protection-enabled MPLS-TP
   networks.

1.  Introduction

   Shared mesh protection (SMP) is a common traffic protection mechanism
   in transport networks, where multiple paths can share the same set of
   network resources for protection purposes.

   In the context of MPLS-TP, it has been explicitly requested as a part
   of the overall solution (Req. 67, 68 and 69 in RFC5654 [RFC5654]).Its
   operation has been further outlined in Section 4.7.6 of MPLS-TP
   Survivability Framework.

   It's important to note that each MPLS-TP LSP may be associated with
   transport network resources.  In event of network failure, it may
   require explicit activation on the protecting paths before switching
   user traffic over.

   In this memo, we define a lightweight signaling mechanism for
   protecting path activation in shared mesh protection-enabled MPLS-TP
   networks.

   Here are the key design goals:

   1.  Fast: The protocol is to activate the previously configured
       protecting paths in a timely fashion, with minimal transport and
       processing overhead.  The goal is to support 50msec end-to-end
       traffic switch-over in large transport networks.

   2.  Reliable message delivery: Activation and deactivation operation
       have serious impact on user traffic.  This requires the protocol
       to adapt a low-overhead reliable messaging mechanism.  The
       activation messages may either traverse through a "trusted"
       transport channel, or require some level of built-in reliability
       mechanism.

   3.  Modular: Depending on deployment scenarios, the signaling may
       need to support functions such as preemption, resource re-
       allocation and bi-directional activation in a modular fashion.

3.  Solution Overview

   In this section, we describe the SMP operation in the context of
   MPLS-TP networks, and outline some of the relevant definitions.

   We refer to the figure below for illustration:

          /                      \
         /                        \

           ----- I ------- J ----

   Working paths: X = {A, B, C, D}, Y = {H, I, J, K}

   Protecting paths: X' = {A, E, F, G, D}, Y' = {H, E, F, G, K}

   The links between E, F and G are shared by both protecting paths.
   All paths are established via MPLS-TP control plane prior to network
   failure.

   All paths are assumed to be bi-directional.  An edge node is denoted
   as a headend or tailend for a particular path in accordance to the
   path setup direction.

   Initially, the operators setup both working and protecting paths.
   During setup, the operators specify the network resources for each
   path.  The working path X and Y will configure the appropriate
   resources on the intermediate nodes, however, the protecting paths,
   X' and Y', will reserve the resources on the nodes, but won't occupy
   them.

   Depending on network planning requirements (such as SRLG), X' and Y'
   may share the same set of resources on node E, F and G. The resource
   assignment is a part of the control-plane CAC operation taking place
   on each node.

   At some time, link B-C is cut.  Node A will detect the outage, and
   initiate activation messages to bring up the protecting path X'.  The
   intermediate nodes, E, F and G will program the switch fabric and
   configure the appropriate resources.  Upon the completion of the
   activation, A will switch the user traffic to X'.

   The operation may have extra caveat:

   1.  Preemption: Protecting paths X' and Y' may share the same
       resources on node E, F or G due to resource constraints.  Y' has
       higher priority than that of X'.  In the previous example, X' is
       up and running.  When there is a link outage on I-J, H can
       activate its protecting path Y'.  On E, F or G, Y' can take over
       the resources from X' for its own traffic.  The behavior is
       acceptable with the condition that A should be notified about the
       preemption action.

   2.  Over-subscription (1:N): A unit of network resource may be
       reserved by one or multiple protecting paths.  In the example,
       the network resources on E-F and F-G are shared by two protecting
       paths, X' and Y'.  In deployment, the over-subscription ratio is
       an important factor on network resource utilization.

3.1.  Protection Switching

   The entire activation and switch-over operation need to be within the
   range of milliseconds to meet customer's expectation.  This section
   illustrates how this may be achieved on MPLS-TP-enabled transport
   switches.  Note that this is for illustration of protection switching
   operation, not mandating the implementation itself.

   The diagram below illustrates the operation:


                            +---------------+
               Control      |    MPLS-TP    |     Control
         <=== Signaling ====| Control Plane |=== Signaling ===>
                            +---------------+
                              /            \
                             /              \ (MPLS label assignment)
                            /                \
                           /                  \
                     +-------+   +------+   +-------+
        Activation   |Line   |   |Switch|   |Line   |   Activation
    <=== Messages ===|Module |===|Fabric|===|Module |=== Messages ===>
                     +-------+   +------+   +-------+


   Typical MPLS-TP user flows (or, LSP's) are bi-directional, and setup
   as co-routed or associated tunnels, with a MPLS label for each of the
   upstream and downstream traffic.  On this particular type of
   transport switch, the control-plane can download the labels to the
   line modules.  Subsequently, the line module will maintain a label
   lookup table on all working and protecting paths.

   Upon the detection of network failure, the headend nodes will
   transmit activation messages along the MPLS LSP's.  When receiving
   the messages, the line modules can locate the associated protecting
   path from the label lookup table, and perform activation procedure by
   programming the switching fabric directly.  Upon its success, the
   line module will swap the label, and forward the activation messages
   to the next hop.

   In summary, the activation procedure involves efficient path lookup
   and switch fabric re-programming.

   To achieve the tight end-to-end switch-over budget, it's possible to
   implement the entire activation procedure with hardware-assistance
   (such as in FPGA or ASIC).  The activation messages are encapsulated
   with a MPLS-TP Generic Associated Channel Header (GACH) [RFC5586].
   Detailed message encoding is explained in later sections.

3.2.  Operation Overview

   To achieve high performance, the activation procedure is designed to
   be simple and straightforward on the network nodes.

   In this section, we describe the activation procedure using the same
   figure shown before:


           ----- B ------- C ----
          /                      \
         /                        \
        A                          D
         \                        /
          \                      /
           ==== E === F === G ===
          /                      \
         /                        \
        H                          K
         \                        /
          \                      /
           ----- I ------- J ----


   Working paths: X = {A, B, C, D}, Y = {H, I, J, K}

   Protecting paths: X' = {A, E, F, G, D}, Y' = {H, E, F, G, K}

   Upon the detection of working path failure, the edge nodes, A, D, H
   and K may trigger the activation messages to activate the protecting
   paths, and redirect user traffic immediately after.

   We assume that there is a consistent definition of priority levels
   among the paths throughout the network.  At activation time, each
   node may rely on the priority levels to potentially preempt other
   paths.

   When the nodes detect path preemption on a particular node, they
   should inform all relevant nodes to free the resources by sending out
   notification messages.  Upon the reception of notification messages,
   the relevant nodes will send out de-activation messages.

   To optimize traffic protection and resource management, each headend
   may periodically poll the protecting paths about resource
   availability.  The intermediate nodes have the option to inform the
   current resource utilization.

   Note that, upon the detection of a working path failure, both headend



Pan, et al.              Expires April 18, 2013                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           Shared Mesh Protection             October 2012


   and tailend may initiate the activation simultaneously (known as bi-
   directional activation).  This may expedite the activation time.
   However, both headend and tailend nodes need to coordinate the order
   of protecting paths for activation, since there may be multiple
   protecting paths for each working path (i.e., 1:N protection).  For
   clarity, we will describe the operation from headend in the memo.
   The tailend operation will be available in the subsequent revisions.


4.  SMP Message and Action Definition

4.1.  Protection Switching Control (PSC) Logic

   Protection switching processes the local triggers described in
   requirements 74-79 of [RFC5654] together with inputs received from
   the tailend node.  Based on these inputs the headend will take SMP
   actions, and transmit different protocol messages.

   Here, we reuse the switching control logic described in MPLS Linear
   Protection, with the following logical decomposition at headend node:


         Server Indication     Control Plane Indication

   The Local Request logic unit accepts the triggers from the OAM,
   external operator commands, from the local control plane (when
   present), and the Wait-to-Restore timer.  By considering all of these
   local request sources it determines the highest priority local
   request.  This high-priority request is passed to the PSC Control
   logic, that will cross-check this local request with the information
   received from the tailend node.  The PSC Control logic uses this
   input to determine what actions need to be taken, e.g. local actions
   at the headend, or what message should be sent to the tailend node.

   Specifically, the signals could be the following:

   o  Clear - if the operator cancels an active local administrative
      command, i.e.  LO/FS/MS.

   o  Lockout of Protection (LO) - if the operator requested to prevent
      switching data traffic to the protection path, for any purpose.

   o  Signal Fail (SF) - if any of the Server Layer, Control plane, or
      OAM indications signaled a failure condition on either the
      protection path or one of the working paths.

   o  Signal Degrade (SD) - if any of the Server Layer, Control plane,
      or OAM indications signaled a degraded transmission condition on
      either the protection path or one of the working paths.

   o  Forced Switch (FS) - if the operator requested that traffic be
      switched from one of the working paths to the protection path,

   o  Manual Switch (MS) - if the operator requested that traffic is
      switched from the working path to the protection path.  This is
      only relevant if there is no currently active fault condition or
      Operator command.

   o  WTR Expires - generated by the WTR timer completing its period.
      If none of the input sources have generated any input then the
      request logic should generate a No Request (NR) request.

   In addition to the local requests, the PSC Control Logic SHALL accept
   PSC messages from the tailend node of the transport path.  Remote
   messages indicate the status of the transport path from the viewpoint
   of the tailend nodes.  The remote requests may include remote LO, SF,
   SD, FS, MS, WTR and NR.

   Much of the signal definition is further described in ITU G.709 and
   G.873.1.

4.2.  SMP Action Types

   As shown in the previous section, SMP requires four actions types
   throughout the operation:

   o  ACTIVATION: This action is triggered by the head-end (or tail-end)
      to activate a protecting connection.  The intermediate nodes need
      to propagate this towards the other end of the protecting
      connection.

   o  DE-ACTIVATION: This action is used to de-activate a particular
      protecting connection.  This can be originated by one end of a
      protecting connection (i.e. head-end, or tail-end).  The
      intermediate nodes need to propagate this towards the other end of
      the protecting connection.

   o  QUERY: This action is used when an operator decides to query a
      particular protecting connection.

   o  NOTIFICATION: SMP operation requires the coordination between
      nodes.  The coordination takes places in two occasions:

      1.  The activation/de-activation is initiated at the headend
          (tailend) nodes.  To avoid potential mis-connection, the user
          traffic cannot be switched on to the protecting connection
          until the reception of an acknowledgement from the tailend
          (headend) nodes.

      2.  If an intermediate node cannot process the activation
          requests, due to lack of resources or preemption levels, it
          needs to report the failure to the request originators.

   It is conceivable that this message can be used to report the
   location of the fault, with respect to a protecting connection so
   that the head-end may use this information as one of the criteria for
   restoring the working transport entity.  The fault location could be
   used by the head-end node to select among a list of possible
   protecting connections associated with the working connection (i.e.
   avoid the faulty location), or to determine that none of the
   provisioned protecting connections is usable at the time the failure
   is reported and then fallback to restoring the working connection.

4.3.  PSC Signal to SMP Action Mapping

   In SMP operation, there is the action-signal mapping:

   o  Activation action: FS, SF, SD, MS

   o  De-activation action: NR

   o  Query action: EXER

   o  Notification action: ACK, NACK (see next section)


5.  Protocol Definition

   Each SMP message has the following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Version: 1

   o  Request:

      *  1111b: Lockout of Protection (LO)

      *  1110b: Forced Switch (FS).  This triggers activation

      *  1100b: Signal Fail (SF).  This triggers activation

      *  1011b: Acknowledgement (ACK).  This is to acknowledge a
         successful activation/de-activation request

      *  1010b: Signal Degrade (SD).  This triggers activation

      *  2: hop-to-hop ack

      *  3: no such path

      *  4: no more resource for the path

      *  5: preempted by another path

      *  6: system failure

      *  7: shared resource has been taken by other paths

   o  Seq: This uniquely identifies a particular message.  This field is
      defined to support reliable message delivery

   Note that the message format and naming convention are very similar
   to that of MPLS linear protection [6] and ITU G.873.1.

5.1.  Message Encapsulation

   SMP messages use MPLS labels to identify the paths.  Further, the
   messages are encapsulated in GAL/GACH:


     0                   1                   2                   3

   GAL is described in [RFC5586].  Activation Channel Type is the GACH
   channel number assigned to the protocol.  This uniquely identifies
   the activation messages.

   Specifically, the messages have the following message format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

5.2.  Reliable Messaging

   The activation procedure adapts a simple two-way handshake reliable
   messaging.  Each node maintains a sequence number generator.  Each
   new sending message will have a new sequence number.  After sending a
   message, the node will wait for a response with the same sequence
   number.

   Specifically, upon the generation of activation, de-activation, query
   and notification messages, the message sender expects to receive
   acknowledgement in reply with same sequence number.

   If a sender is not getting the reply within a time interval, it will
   retransmit the same message with a new sequence number, and starts to
   wait again.  After multiple retries (by default, 3), the sender will
   declare activation failure, and alarm the operators for further
   service.

5.3.  Message Scoping

   Activation signaling uses MPLS label TTL to control how far the
   message would traverse.  Here are the processing rules on each
   intermediate node:

   o  On receive, if the message has label TTL = 0, the node must drop
      the packet without further processing



Pan, et al.              Expires April 18, 2013                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           Shared Mesh Protection             October 2012


   o  The receiving node must always decrement the label TTL value by
      one.  If TTL = 0 after the decrement, the node must process the
      message.  Otherwise, the node must forward the message without
      further processing (unless, of course, the node is headend or
      tailend)

   o  On transmission, the node will adjust the TTL value.  For hop-by-
      hop messages, TTL = 1.  Otherwise, TTL = 0xFF, by default.


6.  Processing Rules

6.1.  Enable a Protecting Path

   Upon the detection of network failure (SF/SD/FS) on a working path,
   the headend node identifies the corresponding MPLS-TP label and
   initiates the protection switching by sending an activation message.

   The activation messages always use MPLS label TTL = 1 to force hop-
   by-hop process.  Upon reception, a next-hop node will locate the
   corresponding path and activate the path.

   If the activation message is received on an intermediate node, due to
   label TTL expiry, the message is processed and then propagated to the
   next hop of the MPLS TP LSP, by setting the MPLS TP label TTL = 1.

   The headend node will declare the success of the activation only when
   it gets a positive reply from the tailend node.  This requires that
   the tailend nodes must reply the messages with ACK to the headend
   nodes in all cases.

   If the headend node is not receiving the acknowledgement within a
   time internal, it will retransmit another activation message with a
   different Seq number.

   If the headend node is not receiving a positive reply within a longer
   time interval, it will declare activation failure.

   If an intermediate node cannot activate a protecting path, it will
   reply a message with NACK to report failure.  When the headend node
   receives the message for failure, it must initiate the de-activation
   messages to clean up networks resources on all the relevant nodes on
   the path.

6.2.  Disable a Protecting Path

   The headend removes the network resources on a path by sending the
   de-activation messages.



Pan, et al.              Expires April 18, 2013                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft           Shared Mesh Protection             October 2012


   In the message, the MPLS label represents the path to be de-
   activated.  The MPLS TTL is one to force hop-by-hop processing.

   Upon reception, a node will de-activate the path, by freeing the
   resources from the data-plane.

   As a part of the clean-up procedure, each de-activation message must
   traverse through and be processed on all the nodes of the
   corresponding path.  When the de-activation message reaches to the
   tailend node, the tailend is required to reply with an
   acknowledgement message to the headend.

   The de-activation process is complete when the headend receives the
   corresponding acknowledgement message from the tailend.

6.3.  Get Protecting Path Status

   The operators have the option to trigger the query messages from the
   headend to check on the protecting path periodically or on-demand.
   The process procedure on each node is very similar to that of the
   activation messages on the intermediate nodes, except the query
   messages should not trigger any network resource re-programming.
   Upon reception, the node will check the availability of resources.

   If the resource is no longer available, the node will reply an NACK
   with error conditions.

6.4.  Preemption

   The preemption operation typically takes place when processing an
   activation message.  If the activating network resources have been
   used by another path and carrying user traffic, the node needs to
   compare the priority levels.

   If the existing path has higher priority, the node needs to reject
   the activation request by sending an ACK to the corresponding headend
   to inform the unavailability of network resources.

   If the new path has higher priority, the node will reallocate the
   resource to the new path, and send an ACK to old path's headend node
   to inform about the preemption.


7.  Security Consideration

   The protection activation takes place in a controlled networking
   environment.  Nevertheless, it is expected that the edge nodes will
   encapsulate and transport external traffic into separated tunnels,

Internet-Draft           Shared Mesh Protection             October 2012


   and the intermediate nodes will never have to process them.


8.  IANA Considerations

   Activation messages are encapsulated in MPLS-TP with a specific GACH
   channel type that needs to be assigned by IANA.
