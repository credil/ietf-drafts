1.  Introduction

   Time synchronization protocols, Network Time Protocol version 4
   (NTPv4) [RFC5905] and Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Version 2, a.k.a.
   IEEE-1588 v.2, can be used to syncronized clocks across network
   domain.  In some scenarios calculation of time packet of time
   syncronization protocol spends within a node, called Resident Time,
   can improve accuracy of clock syncronization.  This document defines
   new Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh) that can be used in Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network to measure Residence Time
   over Label Switched Path (LSP) or Pseudo-wire (PW).  Transport of
   packets of a time synchronization protocol over MPLS domain is
   outside of scope of this document.

2.  Residence Time Measurement

   Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks [RFC6374] can be
   used to measure one-way or two-way end-to-end propagation delay over
   LSP or PW.  But none of these metrics is useful for time
   syncronization across a network.  For example, PTPv2 uses "residence
   time", time it takes for a PTPv2 packet to transit a node, not delay
   of propagation over a link connected to a port receiving the PTP
   event message.


3.  G-ACh for Residence Time Measurement

   RFC 5586 [RFC5586] and RFC 6423 [RFC6423] extended applicability of
   PW Associated Channel (ACH) [RFC5085] to LSPs.  G-ACh presents
   mechanism to transport OAM and other control messages and trigger
   their processing by arbitrary transient LSRs through controlled use
   of Time-to-Live (TTL) value.

   Version field is set to 0, as defined in RFC 4385 [RFC4385].
   Reserved field must be set to 0 on trnsmit and ignored at reception.
   Residence Time Measurement (RTM) G-ACh - value to be allocated by
   IANA.  Scratch pad - 8 octets long field that can be used to
   accumulate residence time the packet spends traversing the node.
   Payload - optional field.  May be used to transport a packet of time
   synchronization protocol.


4.  Theory of Operation

   An LSP ingress LSR, based on information collected through IGP
   extensions that are outside of scope of this document, select to use



Mirsky, et al.           Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Residence Time Measurement           October 2013


   use Residence Time Measurement G-ACh.  The LSR then would use GAL and
   G-ACh header.  The LSR will zero out Scratch Pad field and set TTL
   value so that TTL expiration will be at the next RTM capable
   downstream LSR.

   Upon expiration of RTM packet an LSR would substract local time value
   from the value in the Scratch Pad field and processes the packet
   according to label stack information.  If the packet to be forwarded,
   the LSR will set TTL value so that the TTL expiration takes place at
   the next RTM-capable downstream LSR.  The LSR adds local time value
   to the value in the Scratch Pad field as close to the start of packet
   transmition as possible.

   LSP terminating LSR may use value accumulated in the Scratch Pad
   field as time correction as it represent sum of Residence Time of all
   traveresed RTM capable LSR between end points of the LSP.  For
   example, egress LSR may be PTP Boundary Clock syncronized to a Master
   Clock and as Slave Clock will use accumulated in the Scratch Pad
   Field value to update PTP's Correction Field.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to reserve a new G-ACh as follows:

          +-------+----------------------------+---------------+
          | Value |         Description        | Reference     |
          +-------+----------------------------+---------------+
          | X     | Residence Time Measurement | This document |
          +-------+----------------------------+---------------+

                  Table 1: New Residence Time Measurement


6.  Security Considerations

   Routers that support Residence Time Measurement are subject to the
   same security considerations as defined in [RFC5586] and [RFC6423].
