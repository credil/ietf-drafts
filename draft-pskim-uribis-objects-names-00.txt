     An Object-Centric Name Space for Various Communication Objects

                draft-pskim-uribis-objects-names-00.txt

Abstract

   This draft suggests a name space for identifier based Internet that 
   has been considered to support the future Internet for mobile 
   environment. The suggested name space considers a host-centric for 
   the current stage as well as an object-centric for the next stage. 
   To consider scalability and distributed architecture, the format of 
   the name space consists of object category, local name, domain name, 
   and parameters.

1.  Introduction

   Recently, several architectures of mobile-centric approach has been 
   designed to support the mobile environment of future Internet, such 
   as MobilityFirst[MF] in US, 4WARD[4WARD] in EU, AKARI[AKARI] in 
   JAPAN and MOFI[MOFI] in Korea. Such architectural design works 
   include a lot of technical issues such as locator/identifier 
   separation, hybrid communication with locator/identifier, delay 
   tolerant networks, storage aware routing, in-network management, 
   strong security and privacy model, separation of control and data 
   planes, etc. Among them, the locator/identifier separation has been 
   considered as a key design principle. In the locator/identifier 
   separation[LISP], the identifier plays a role of a unique identifier
   for communication end-point and locator plays a role of a 
   topological and routable address in the network. On the other hand, 
   the IP addressing in today's Internet overloads identifier and 
   locator, which has introduced critical shortcomings such as routing 
   scalability (routing table explosion) and IP address managements 
   issues (mobility, multi-homing, IPv4/IPv6 transition).

   As shown in mobile-centric architectural design works [MF]-[MOFI], 
   the identifier is performing a primary role at the data plane as 
   well as the control plane. However, formats for these identifiers 
   have a human-unfriendly form such as self-certifying public key, 
   self-allocating fixed-length string, etc. Thus, a human readable 
   name space should be required for binding and resolution, such as 
   DNS. Moreover, the identifier is being assigned for various 
   communication objects for sensors, contents, contexts as well as 
   hosts. This means that communication objects in mobile-centric 
   future Internet would not be limited by the host. So, a name space 
   should be designed with consideration of the scalability for 
   tremendous communication objects.

2.  A Name Space for Various Communication Objects
   
   In general, the name space for the networking system defines the 
   structure of the name system and the rules for creating names. The 
   name space is the most abstract among main functions of a name 
   system. It is also the most fundamental part of the name system, 
   since it actually describes how the names are created. 
   
   For a name space, various communication objects are considered such 
   as user, file, device, service, content, and more. In addition, the 
   name space architecture will be hierarchical for the scalability and 
   flat for the semantic, which can be represented by mixing the 
   network access identifier (NAI)[RFC 4282] and the uniform resource 
   identifier (URI)[RFC2396]. Ultimately, the name space can consists 
   of object category, local name, domain name, and parameter as 
   follows:

       <object category>://<local name>@<domain name>:<parameters> 

     - Object category : Category of objects such as user, file, 
              device, service , content, context, etc.
     - Local name (Flat): Semantic name of object.
     - Domain name (Hierarchical) : Name of domain where the user 
              subscribes to the communication service for objects or 
              the object is logically associated
     - Parameters (Option) : Parameters can be appended according to 
              object category

   Example:

     device://air-conditioner@irvine.ca.us:appliance:home:irvine-92614

     - Objejct category : device
     - Local name : air-conditioner
     - Domain name : irvine.ca.us
     - Parameters : appliance, home, irvine-92614 (naming an 
              appliance at home with address "Irvine-92614"

     device://air-conditioner@irvine.ca.us:device:car:6vad286

     - Objejct category : device
     - Local name : air-conditioner
     - Domain name : irvine.ca.us
     - Parameters : appliance, car, ac33-irvine (naming an appliance 
              inside a car with plate number "6vad286"

   Based on the designed name space, a name system will be designed 
   using indirection approach. Name registries, that is, name servers 
   should be distributed according to communication object

   categorization. For timely binding, a fast propagation mechanism of 
   binding update should be required. In addition, for the resolution, 
   a parsing mechanism for name should be also required.
