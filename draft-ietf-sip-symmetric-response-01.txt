The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) operates over UDP and TCP, among
others.  When used with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the
source address the request came from, and to the port written into the
topmost Via header field value of the request.  This behavior is not
desirable in many cases, most notably, when the client is behind a
Network Address Translator (NAT).  This extension defines a new
parameter for the Via header field, called "rport", that allows a
client to request that the server send the response back to the
source IP address and port from which the request originated.

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
