             Secure SMTP with TLS, DNSSEC and TLSA records.
                        draft-ietf-dane-smtp-00

Abstract

   SMTP has a STARTTLS extension, but (especially in the case of inter-
   domain mail transfer) it only provides very limited security because
   it does not specify how to authenticate the server's certificate.
   This memo specifies how TLSA records in the DNS can be used for
   proper SMTP server authentication.

Internet-Draft               SMTP with TLSA                 January 2013


1.  Introduction

   The specification for SMTP over TLS [RFC3207] does not describe how
   to authenticate a server: which identity relating to the connection
   ought to be authenticated by the server's certificate.  In practice,
   most certificates presented by publicly-referenced SMTP servers
   either cannot be validated with respect to a well-known certification
   authority, or do not verify any identity expected by the client.

   As a result, inter-domain SMTP clients cannot require working server
   authentication if they want to successfully send mail using TLS.
   Therefore TLS currently provides only a limited amount of additional
   security for inter-domain SMTP.  Its encryption protects against on-
   path passive eavesdropping; but it does not protect against an active
   attack, since the client has no way to detect when an attacker is
   spoofing the server.

   This memo describes how to fix this using DNSSEC [RFC4033] and TLSA
   records [RFC6698] with owner names of the form "_25._tcp.hostname".

   We use DNSSEC to secure the association between a mail domain and its
   SMTP server host names, and between the host names and their
   certificates.  Connections to servers are authenticated by their TLS
   certificates.

   As well as its normal function of providing an association between a
   domain name and a certificate, we are also using the existance of a
   TLSA record to signal to the client that it can expect the server to
   offer TLS with a valid certificate.

   The security situation is better for intra-domain SMTP, because in
   this case the client and server can be configured with prior
   knowledge of how to authenticate each other.  This specification can
   also be used for authenticating servers in intra-domain SMTP.

   This memo does not cover message submission [RFC4409] [RFC5068]
   [RFC6186], nor does it cover LMTP [RFC2033], since they use the DNS
   in a different way than MTA-to-MTA SMTP.

   The protocol described in this memo adds new security checks that can
   cause email delivery to be delayed when a security failure is
   detected.  We specify that clients treat a problems as a "temporary
   failure", causing the message to be queued for a later delivery
   attempt, in the hope that the attack (or configuration error) will
   have been dealt with.

1.1.  Questions for reviewers

   Is the Transmitted: header useful enough to include in this spec?
   Should it be dropped, or perhaps moved to another document?

   Is the "dane" MTA-name-type for use in delivery status notifications
   a good idea?  Is it likely to cause interoperability problems?

   Is the description of DNSSEC validation over-done?  Can it be trimmed
   down so it relies more on the core DNSSEC specs?


2.  Terminology

   ADMD:  An ADministrative Management Domain, as described in the
      Internet Mail Architecture [RFC5598].

   Inter-domain SMTP:  SMTP between different ADMDs across the public
      Internet, where a client MTA sends mail to a publicly-referenced
      SMTP server MTA.

   Intra-domain SMTP:  SMTP between MTAs within an ADMD.

   Mail domain:  The part of an email address after the "@"; also the
      owner name of a (possibly implicit) MX record.

   MX resolution:  The algorithm for resolving a mail domain into a set
      of SMTP server hosts, described in [RFC5321] section 5.

   Publicly-referenced SMTP server:  An SMTP server which runs on port
      25 of an Internet host located using MX resolution.  (This term is
      from [RFC3207].)

   SMTP server host name:  The target of a (possibly implicit) MX
      record.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   memo are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Inter-domain SMTP with TLSA

   In the following we describe some additions to the usual MX
   resolution algorithm described in [RFC5321] section 5.  If there is
   any conflict between this memo and the other specifications cited in
   this section, that is an error in this memo.

Internet-Draft               SMTP with TLSA                 January 2013


3.1.  MX lookup checks

   The client SHALL look up the MX RRset for the mail domain.  There are
   three succesful results that yield a list of SMTP server host names:

   o  A list of one or more MX records;

   o  An implicit MX record, in lieu of an empty list of MX records;

   o  A CNAME or DNAME pointing to a successful result.

   If the lookup is not successful, the client SHALL proceed as
   described in [RFC5321] section 5.

   If any of the responses is "bogus" according to DNSSEC validation
   ([RFC4033] section 5) the client MUST treat this as a temporary
   error.

   For this protocol to take effect, all of these DNS RRsets MUST be
   "secure" according to DNSSSEC validation.  In the case of an implicit
   MX record, there MUST be a secure denial of existence of an MX RRset
   for the mail domain.  In the case of a (chain of) CNAME or DNAME RRs,
   the whole chain MUST be secure as well as the ultimate target.

   If they are not all secure, this protocol has not been fully
   deployed.  The client SHOULD fall back to insecure delivery (which
   might be over unauthenticated TLS).

   (If the client is using a non-validating security-aware stub resolver
   (see [RFC4033] section 7), it can rely on its recursive name server
   to perform these checks and set the AD bit according to the result -
   see [RFC4035] section 3.2.3.)

   The client now has an authentic list of SMTP server host names and
   priority values.  It processes this list as described in [RFC5321]
   section 5 (sorting the host names etc.) without regard to the
   presence or absence of DNSSEC or TLSA records.

3.2.  SMTP server checks

   This sub-section applies to each SMTP server host name individually.

   When connecting to a server, the client SHALL look up the server's
   TLSA RRset as described in [RFC6698] section 3.  That is, the TLSA
   RRset owner name SHALL be "_25._tcp.hostname" where "hostname" is the
   SMTP server host name.  The response can be one of the following (as
   listed in [RFC6698] section 4.1):

Internet-Draft               SMTP with TLSA                 January 2013


   o  A secure answer containing one or more TLSA records, in which case
      the client SHALL proceed as descrbed below.

   o  A bogus answer or other failure, which the client MUST treat as a
      temporary error.

   o  If there is no TLSA record or its DNSSEC validation state is
      insecure or indeterminate, this protocol has not been fully
      deployed.  The client SHOULD deliver to this server insecurely
      (which might be over unauthenticated TLS, as described in the
      introduction).

   The client now has one or more TLSA records for the server it is
   connecting to.

   The client MUST ensure that the server offers the STARTTLS service
   extension [RFC3207] in its response to the client's EHLO command
   ([RFC5321] section 4.1.1.1).

   The client SHALL then issue the STARTTLS command which MUST be
   successful.  It then proceeds with TLS negotiation [RFC5246].  If the
   client uses the Server Name Indication TLS extension ([RFC6066]
   section 3) it MUST use the SMTP server host name as the value for the
   ServerName field.

   The client SHALL validate the server's certificate as described in
   [RFC6698] section 2.1.  (This might or might not include PKIX
   certificate validation [RFC5280].)

   The client SHALL verify that the server host name matches the
   identity asserted by the server's certificate as described in
   [RFC6125] section 6.  Following that specification, the client's list
   of reference identifiers SHOULD include the SMTP server host name
   with type DNS-ID, and MAY include a second copy of the host name with
   type CN-ID.

   If any of these checks fail, the client MUST disconnect from the
   server and treat this as a temporary failure.

   If all the checks pass, the client can then proceed to deliver mail
   securely.


4.  Intra-domain SMTP with TLSA

   Mail transmission within an ADMD can be based on MX records (such as
   when delivering incoming mail to its destination host) or on
   statically configured host names (such as when routing outgoing mail



Finch                     Expires July 29, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               SMTP with TLSA                 January 2013


   via a border relay).

   When routing internal mail using MX records, Section 3 applies the
   same as for inter-domain SMTP.

   When routing mail using host names, the MX lookup step is skipped and
   only Section 3.2 applies.


5.  The Transmitted: header field

   The client MAY wish to insert a Transmitted: header field at the
   start of the message header just before transmitting the message.
   This records the result of the checks specified in the previous
   section.  (See Section 7 for some comments on its utility or lack
   thereof.)  It is a client-side counterpart to the Received: header
   field ([RFC5321] section 4.4) and has very similar syntax.  It SHOULD
   be treated as a trace field.

   The syntax of the Transmitted: header field is described using ABNF
   [RFC5234].  Non-terminal syntax rules not defined in this memo are
   defined in [RFC5321], or [RFC5322], or [RFC5234].


   Transmitted-line  = "Transmitted:" FWS To-domain By-domain
                                Opt-info [CFWS] ";" date-time CRLF

   To-domain         = "TO" FWS Extended-Domain

   A <Transmitted-line> SHALL include:

   o  A <To-domain> clause describing the SMTP server.  The <Domain>
      part of a <To-domain> SHALL be the same as the SMTP server host
      name.

   o  A <By-domain> clause identifying the SMTP client that added the
      header.  (If the client also acts as a server this is the same
      <By-domain> clause it would include in any Received: header fields
      it adds.)  This clause helps with recovery if the original order
      of a message header's fields has been lost.

   o  Various <Opt-info> clauses, which MUST include a <With> clause.
      The <Protocol> part of this clause is used to indicate whether the
      client successfully authenticated the server, using one of the
      types specified in Section 6.1.

   o  And a <date-time> to further help with disordering in case a
      message is transmitted by the same client more than once.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  "with" protocol types

   The "with" protocol type registry includes a number of keywords that
   indicate the use of SMTP with or without TLS and/or AUTH [RFC3848].
   When these types appear in a Transmitted: header field "with" clause
   they indicate that the client did not authenticate the server as
   described in Section 3.

   o  The new keyword "ESMTPT" indicates the use of ESMTP [RFC5321] with
      STARTTLS [RFC3207] when the client successfully authenticated the
      server.

   o  The new keyword "ESMTPTA" indicates the use of ESMTP [RFC5321]
      with STARTTLS [RFC3207] and AUTH [RFC4954] when the client
      successfully authenticated the server.

   These new keywords are not for use in Received: header fields since
   the server cannot tell whether or not the client authenticated it.

   There are no keywords corresponding to a client trying and failing to
   authenticate the server, since in this case no message transmission
   occurs.

6.2.  Permanent message header field registration

6.3.  "dane" MTA-name-type

   Delivery status notifications [RFC3464] can include a Remote-MTA
   field recording an SMTP server host name.  When this has been
   authenticated according to Section 3 the reporting MTA MAY use an
   MTA-type-name of "dane".

7.  Security considerations

7.1.  Fallback to insecure SMTP

   This memo provides only conditional security.  It allows a server to
   publish in the DNS the details of how it can be authenticated.
   Clients that implement this protocol can use it to provide a strong
   guarantee that they are sending mail to the correct place.  If either
   of these is missing, mail delivery will be insecure.

   There is no secure way for a server to tell if a client has
   authenticated it using this protocol.  This is a general limitation
   of TLS.  The Transmitted: header field records this information for
   tracing and debugging and measuring deployment, not for security
   purposes.

   We do not specify that clients check that all of a mail domain's SMTP
   server host names are consistent in whether they have or do not have
   TLSA records.  This is so that partial or incremental deployment does
   not break mail delivery.  Different levels of deployment are likely
   if a domain has a third-party backup MX, for example.

   The MX sorting rules are unchanged; in particular they have not been
   altered in order to prioritize secure servers over insecure servers.
   If a site wants to be secure it needs to deploy this protocol
   completely; a partial deployment is not secure and we make no special
   effort to support it.

7.2.  A mail domain trusts its SMTP servers

   By signing their zone with DNSSEC, a mail domain owner implicitly
   instructs SMTP clients to check their SMTP server TLSA records.  This
   implies another point in the trust relationship between mail domain
   owner and smtp server operator.  Most of the setup requirements for
   this protocol fall on the SMTP server operator: installing a TLS
   certificate with the correct name, and publishing a TLSA record under
   that name.  If these are not correct then mail delivery from TLSA-
   aware clients might be delayed.

7.3.  Temporary failures and denial of service

   Many provisioning failures in SMTP cause "permanent" failures, that
   is the immediate and final rejection of the message.  This includes
   missing DNS records, an SMTP server that is not configured to accept
   mail for the recipient domain, and so forth.



Finch                     Expires July 29, 2013                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               SMTP with TLSA                 January 2013


   In this protocol, provisioning an incorrect TLS certificate triggers
   a temporary error.  This is because we want to minimise the damage
   that occurs when an on-path attacker intercepts the TCP connection
   between an SMTP client and server.  An attacker can cause delays, but
   is not able to trigger immediate delivery failures.

7.4.  Certificate subject name matching

   Section 4 of the TLSA specification [RFC6698] leaves the details of
   checking names in certificates to higher level application protocols,
   though it suggests the use of [RFC6125].

   Name checking might appear to be unnecessary, since DNSSEC provides a
   secure binding between the server name and the TLSA record, which in
   turn authenticates the certificate.  However this latter step can be
   indirect, via a chain of certificates.  A usage=0 TLSA record only
   authenticates the CA that issued the certificate, and third parties
   can obtain certificates from the same CA.

   So this specification says that SMTP clients check that the server's
   certificate matches the server host name, to ensure that the
   certificate was issued by the CA to the server that the client is
   connecting to.  The client always performs this check regardless of
   the TLSA usage, because the implementation is simpler and so that
   this specification is less likely to need updating when new TLSA
   usages are added.

7.5.  Deliberate omissions

   We do not specify that clients check the DNSSEC state of the SMTP
   server address records.  This is not necessary since the certificate
   checks ensure that the client has connected to the correct server.
   (The address records will normally have the same security state as
   the TLSA records, but they can differ if there are CNAME or DNAME
   indirections.)

   This memo does not specify any changes to SMTP client authentication.
   Inter-domain SMTP client authentication remains extremely weak.
   Intra-domain SMTP can be configured as strong as necessary (using
   SMTP AUTH or TLS client certificates, for instance) but that is out
   of scope for this memo.


8.  Internationalization Considerations

   If any of the DNS queries are for an internationalized domain name,
   then they need to use the A-label form [RFC5890].

Internet-Draft               SMTP with TLSA                 January 2013


Appendix A.  Example

   In the following, most of the DNS resource data is elided for
   simplicity.


   ; mail domain
   example.com.              MX      1 mx.example.net.
   example.com.              RRSIG   MX ...

   ; SMTP server host name
   mx.example.net.           A      192.0.2.1
   mx.example.net.           AAAA   2001:db8:212:8::e:1

   ; TLSA resource record
   _25._tcp.mx.example.net.  TLSA   ...
   _25._tcp.mx.example.net.  RRSIG  TLSA ...

   Mail for addresses at example.com is delivered by SMTP to
   mx.example.net.  Connections to mx.example.net port 25 that use
   STARTTLS will get a server certificate that authenticates the name
   mx.example.net.


Appendix B.  Rationale - choice of certificate identity

   There are a number of reasons for the certificate to authenticate the
   SMTP server host name rather than the mail domain.

   SMTP allows a client to transfer mail to recipients at multiple
   domains in the same connection.  If the certificate identifies the
   host name then it does not need to list all the possible mail
   domains.

   It is not in general feasible for the server to select a mail domain
   certificate based on the recipient domains when the connection is
   established (using Server Name Indication, [RFC6066] section 3),
   because an SMTP client might not know all of the recipients when it
   establishes the connection.

   Outgoing SMTP relays and message submission servers handle mail for
   any domain, so in those cases the only sensible option is for the
   certificate to contain the host name.  It is more consistent for
   incoming MX server certificates to match.

   It is common for SMTP servers to act in multiple roles, as outgoing
   relays or as incoming MX servers, depending on the client identity.
   It is simpler if the server can present the same certificate

   regardless of the role in which it is to act.

   Sometimes the server does not know its role until the client has
   authenticated, which usually occurs after TLS has been established.

   This protocol does not provide an option for directly authenticating
   the mail domain because that would add complexity without providing
   any benefit, and security protocols are best kept simple.  As
   described above, there are real-world cases where authenticating the
   mail domain cannot be made to work, so there are complicated criteria
   for when mail domain TLSA records might be used and when they cannot.
   This is all avoided by authenticating the SMTP server host name.

   Finally, this protocol only affects the logic in the SMTP client and
   requires no additional SMTP server functionality, such as support for
   the TLS Server Name Indication extension.
