         Per-Host Locators for Distributed Mobility Management
                 draft-liebsch-mext-dmm-nat-phl-00.txt

Abstract

   Mobile operators consider the distribution of mobility anchors to
   enable offloading some traffic from their core network.  In scope of
   a solution for Distributed Mobility Management is the maintenance of
   IP sessions and IP address continuity when mobile nodes get a new
   mobility anchor assigned during handover.  This document proposes the
   use of identifier-locator split concepts to achieve optimal routing
   of data packets to a mobile node's current mobility anchor.  The use
   of per-host locator IP addresses allows translation of addresses
   within the mobile operator network to route packets to the mobile
   node's current mobility anchor, while address translation is kept
   transparent to the communication endpoints.

Internet-Draft            DMM per-host locator              October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The concept of Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) in based on the
   distribution of mobility anchors towards the access networks to
   provide mobile nodes with local anchors and enable optimal routing of
   traffic above anchor level to any kind of serving point, e.g.
   distributed content caches.  The closer mobility anchors are located
   to mobile nodes, the more a mobile node's handover may necessitate
   the assignment of a new mobility anchor.  Continuity of a mobile
   node's IP address or IP address prefix enables IP session continuity,
   but creates the problem of routing downlink packets to the mobile
   node's current mobility anchor.  Different solutions and associated
   extensions to IP mobility management protocols are being considered
   to maintain a mobile node's IP session after mobility anchor
   relocation.

   The solution for DMM as described in this document adopts the concept
   of an identifier-locator split to solve the routing above anchor
   level and enable optimal routes to the mobile node's current mobility
   anchor.  Whereas the mobile node's Home Network Prefix (HNP) or Home
   Address is treated solely as identifier after mobility anchor
   relocation, the mobile node's current mobility anchor represents the
   locator.  The proposed solution assumes an Ingress Router (IR) which
   resolves the MN's identifier into a locator address.  The mobile
   node's current mobility anchor serves as Egress Router (ER).

   Instead of using encapsulation to tunnel packets between an IR and
   the ER, per-host locator addresses are used to address translate
   downlink packets at the IR(s) and route packets to the mobile node's
   anchor.  Locator addresses are overloaded to carry identifier
   information, which allows the ER to reverse address translate the
   packet's destination address into the mobile node's identifier (HNP
   or Home Address) as assigned by the initial mobility anchor.

3.  Routing Plane Considerations of DMM

   The problem of routing downlink packets to the mobile node's current
   mobility anchor after anchor relocation is depicted in Figure 1.  The
   MN initially attaches to a Mobility Anchor (MA) and gets assigned an
   HNP from this MA's prefix pool in case Proxy Mobile IPv6 is used as
   mobility management protocol below MAs.  In case Mobile IPv6 is used,
   the initial MA assigns a Home Address to the MN.  In the following
   description, PMIPv6 is assumed, whereas the proposed solution for DMM
   is independent of the mobility management protocol.  The MN's initial
   anchor is denoted as previous MA (pMA), whereas the new anchor is
   denoted as new MA (nMA)

   The following symbolic notation of IP addresses is used: [Prefix]::
   [Suffix].

   The initial anchor pMA assigns the prefix A:1:: to the MN as a result
   of the MN's registration.  Routers in the mobile operator's core
   network forward all packets with prefix (PFX) A:x:: towards pMA.  As
   a result of handover, the MN gets a new mobility anchor (nMA)
   assigned.  In case nMA continues anchoring the MN's initially

   assigned IP address prefix, the DMM solution must enable forwarding
   of downlink packets to the nMA instead of following the default
   routing states, which forward all A:x:: prefixes to the pMA.
   Forwarding of packets from the pMA to the nMA may imply suboptimal
   routes from the CN.

   Figure 2 depicts the generic concept of using an Ingress Router (IR)
   to resolve the MN's HNP into the associated locator address, which is
   represented by the MN's current MA (nMA).  The mechanism to resolve
   the locator is out of scope of this version of the document.  As the
   nMA serves as locator and ER, the IR can set up a forwarding tunnel
   to the ER.  The inner packet carries the MN's identifier, which
   allows forwarding of the packet after decapsulation of the tunnel at
   the ER according to the mobility management protocol supported by the
   nMA.

   Since the IR can be topologically far away from the nMA, the solution
   described in this document is based on address translation instead of
   using encapsulation between the IR and the ER.

4.  Use of NATs and per-host locators

   Translation of the MN's IP address into the locator address (pMA)
   implies loosing identifier information, which results in an issue at
   the ER to reverse address translate the MN's downlink packets into
   the associated identifier address (HNP, Home Address).  Hence, the
   proposed solution is based on per-host locators instead of referring
   to the nMA's IP address as locator.  Building the per-host locator is
   intrinsically supported by MAs for IP mobility management and are
   represented by the HNP or the Home Address respectively.

   At the nMA, the initially assigned address serves as identifier
   (HNP_id), whereas the nMA assigns a new HNP to the MN after
   registration, which is treated as per-host locator (HNP_loc).  The
   HNP_loc is not advertised to the MN for address configuration, but
   provided to a mapping system, which enables IRs to resolve the HNP_id
   into an HNP_loc.  The description of the mapping system is out of
   scope of the current version of this document.  Figure 3 illustrates
   NATing the downlink packet's destination address at the IR into the
   HNP_loc.  According to local binding information, the nMA can reverse
   address translate the packet into the original IP address of the MN,
   which carries the HNP_id prefix.  Further forwarding from the nMA is
   performed according to the used mobility management protocol.
