    <abstract>
      <t>The Short Message Service (SMS) of mobile cellular networks
      is frequently used in Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications,
      such as for telematic devices. The service offers small packet
      sizes and high delays just as other typical low-power and lossy
      networks (LLNs), i.e. 6LoWPANs. The design of the Constrained
      Application Protocol (CoAP), that took the limitations of LLNs
      into account, is thus also applicable to telematic M2M
      devices. The adaption of CoAP to the SMS transport mechanism is
      described in this document.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification details the usage of the Constrained
      Application Protocol on the Short Message Service of mobile
      cellular networks.</t>

      <section title="Scenarios">
      <t>
      <xref target="cell2cell_sms" /> to <xref
      target="ip2cell_sms_prov" /> show various applicable usage
      scenarios of CoAP in M2M communications.

      Two mobile cellular terminals communicate by exchanging CoAP
      Request and Response embedded into SMS PDUs (depicted in
      <xref target="cell2cell_sms" />).

      Two mobile cellular terminals communicate by exchanging the CoAP
      Request in an SMS PDU and the CoAP Responce using GPRS
      transport. (depicted in <xref target="cell2cell_sms_gprs" />).

      <figure align="center" anchor="cell2cell_sms_gprs" title="Cellular and Cellular Communication (SMS/GPRS-based)">

          (GPRS)
            ]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      An IP host and a mobile cellular terminal communicate by
      exchanging CoAP Request and Response. The IP host uses protocols
      offered by the SMS-C (e.g. Computer Interface to Message
      Distribution (CIMD <xref target="cimd" />), Universal Computer
      Protocol/External Machine Interface (UCP/EMI <xref target="ucp"
      />), Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP <xref target="smpp" />) ) to
      submit an SMS for delivery, which contains the CoAP Request
      (depicted in <xref target="ip2cell_sms" />).


      <figure align="center" anchor="ip2cell_sms" title="IP and Cellular Communication (only SMS-based)">
        <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[

      </figure>

      Again, the return path for the CoAP response might be GPRS (depicted in
      <xref target="ip2cell_sms_gprs" />).

      There are service providers offering SMS delivery and
      notification using an HTTP/REST interface (depicted in <xref
      target="ip2cell_sms_prov" />).

    <section title="Encoding of CoAP for SMS transport">
      <t>The content of SMS can be coded in 7, 8 or 16 bit characters <xref
      target="3gpp_ts23.038" />. The advantages and disadvantages
      are:

      <list style="letters">
          <t>7 bit encoding: Sending 7 bit encoded SMS possible with
          almost all devices. CoAP binary data needs to be re-encoded,
          possibly with <xref target="RFC4648">Base64 RFC
          4648</xref>.</t>

          <t>8 bit encoding: CoAP binary data does not need to be
          re-encoded. Not all telematic devices support 8 bit SMS
          encoding.</t>

          <t>16 bit encoding: CoAP binary data needs to be
          re-encoded. Not all telematic devices support 16 bit SMS
          encoding.</t>
      </list>

      The currently safest solution is to use 7 bit encoded SMS
      including Base64 encoded CoAP payload.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Message Size Implementation Considerations">
      <t>Using 7 bit encoding 160 characters are allowed in 1 SMS, while
      using 8 bit encoding 140 characters are allowed. <xref

      <t>Possible options for larger CoAP messages are:

      <t>Open question: Is the introduction of a new CoAP option
      Reply-To-Uri-Host necessary, if the server should use the GPRS
      transport for the Response? This relates to <xref
