Internet-Draft                  BULK-XML                     August 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Literal numerical values are provided in decimal or hexadecimal as
   appropriate.  Hexadecimal literals are prefixed with "0x" to
   distinguish them from decimal literals.

   BULK bytes sequences and expressions are described with the same
   conventions than used in the BULK 1.0 specification [BULK1]

2.  BULK XML namespace

   The Simple XML namespace is an official namespace identified by the
   UUID <urn:uuid:8e9fbe9c-2b0c-5307-bb81-edb1a7727563> (BULK,
   http://www.w3.org/XML/Core/).

   It is a simplistic notation for the XML data available after parsing
   an XML document is complete.  As such, it doesn't provide a way to
   serialize some components of an XML document, such as the contents of
   the DTD or unparsed entities.  In particular, the encoding
   declaration of the XML prolog is not serialized, as BULK sreams
   already carry encoding information.  As for any other BULK data,
   everywhere within an Simple XML form, a "stringenc" form can appear.

   An application writing Simple XML data SHOULD use "rdf:prefix" to
   denote element and attribute prefixed names and arrays for unprefixed
   names.  The semantics of the "rdf:prefix" form are application-
   dependent; an application could choose to evaluate it without
   changing its value beforehand, thus using expanded names (cf.
   [XML-NAMES10] and [XML-NAMES11]), or follow the XML Infoset
   [XML-INFOSET] principle of keeping the namespace and local part of
   the name separate.

   Note that Simple XML cannot store the original prefix associated with
   a namespace.  The goal is to be able to serialize just enough data
   from a parsed XML document that an equivalent XML document can be
   unserialized.  By equivalent, we mean that it would have the same
   semantics as the original XML document for applications using this
   XML format (but defining this latter equivalence in a remotely decent
   way is outside the scope of this specification).

   Character data (corresponding to "CDATA" sections and "#PCDATA" in
   XML) SHOULD be serialized as arrays.

Internet-Draft                  BULK-XML                     August 2013


   Note: authors of BULK XML namespaces are encouraged to define names
   in such a way that frequently-used expressions can be serialized as
   compactly as possible, using "rdf:prefix", "define", "subst" or any
   similar constructs.  This is particularly straightforward and useful
   for enumerated attributes (but could be used for more complex
   structures).

2.1.  XML 1.0 entity

   name  "0x1" (mnemonic: "xml1.0" )

   shape  "( xml1.0 {content} )"

   This form denotes an entity (document entity or external entity)
   whose XML version is 1.0.

   Type: "Entity"

2.2.  XML 1.1 entity

   name  "0x2" (mnemonic: "xml1.1" )

   shape  "( xml1.1 {content} )"

   This form denotes an entity (document entity or external entity)
   whose XML version is 1.1.

   Type: "Entity"

2.3.  Processing instruction

   name  "0x3" (mnemonic: "pi" )

   shape  "( pi {target} {content} )"

   Type: "PI"

2.4.  Comment

   name  "0x4" (mnemonic: "comment" )

   shape  "( comment {content} )"

   Type: "Comment"

2.5.  Element

   name  "0x5" (mnemonic: "element" )

   shape  "( element {name} {content} )"

   Type: "Element"

2.6.  Attribute

   name  "0x6" (mnemonic: "attribute" )

   shape  "( attribute {name} {value} )"

   Type: "Attribute"

2.7.  xml: namespace

   name  "0x7" (mnemonic: "xml:" )

   value  "( prefix "http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" )"

2.8.  xmlns: namespace

   name  "0x8" (mnemonic: "xmlns:" )

   value  "( prefix "http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/" )"

2.9.  space preservation

   name  "0x9" (mnemonic: "preserve" )

   value  "( attribute ( xml: "space" ) "preserve" )"

Appendix A.  Shorthand examples

   Here are a couple of examples of the kind of definitions that can be
   used to increase compactness in an XML serialization.

   First, this specification defines general forms for XML data.  But
   namespaces can be dedicated to XML formats, with names for each
   element, attribute or PI:

   o  "( define ?rfc ( subst ( pi "rfc" ( rest 0 ) ) ) )"

   o  "( define t ( subst ( element "t" ( rest 0 ) ) ) )"

   Secondly, recurring patterns can be abbreviated:

   o  "( define thang ( subst ( t ( attribute "hangText" ( arg 0 ) ) (
      rest 1 )"

   o  "( define verb ( subst ( spanx ( attribute "verb" ) ( rest 0 ) ) )
      )"
