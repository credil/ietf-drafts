Internet-Draft         RIR RESTful JSON RESPONSES             March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have begun experimenting with
   RESTful web services for access to Whois data.  RIR-QUERY
   [I-D.newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query] presents uniform patterns which
   may be used to contruct URLs for accessing data from these RESTful
   web services.  This document describes responses in the JSON
   [RFC4627] serialization format to the query URLs in RIR-QUERY.

   As this document describes responses returned in JSON [RFC4627]
   format, other documents may describe responses in other formats to
   the same URL queries.

2.  Signalling for JSON

   To receive JSON [RFC4627] responses, clients SHOULD put the
   "application/json" MIME type in the Accept header.  Servers SHOULD
   respond with JSON responses when this MIME type is present in the
   Accept header in accordance with the preference rules for the Accept
   header in HTTP [RFC2616], however the use of multiple MIME types in
   the Accept header is NOT RECOMMENDED.

3.  JSON Naming

   Clients processing JSON [RFC4627] responses SHOULD ignore values
   associated with unrecognized names.  Servers MAY insert values
   signified by names into the JSON responses which are not specified in
   this document.  Insertion of unspecified values into JSON responses
   SHOULD have names prefixed with a short identifier followed by an
   underscore followed by a meaningful name.

   For example, "handle" is specified in this document as the name of a
   value which is a string containing an RIR unique identifier for a
   registration.  The RIR of the Moon might desire to insert a value
   specific to their services denoting that a registration occured
   before or after the first moon landing.  The name for such a value
   might take the form "lunarNic_beforeOneSmallStep".

   JSON names SHOULD only consist of the alphabetic ASCII characters A
   through Z in both uppercase and lowercase, underscore characters, and
   SHOULD NOT begin with an underscore character or the characters
   "xml".  This restriction is a union of the Ruby programming language
   identifier syntax and the XML element name syntax and has two
   purposes.  First, client implementers using modern programming
   languages such as Ruby or Java may use libraries that automatically
   promote JSON values to first order object attributes or members (e.g.
   using the example above, the values may be referenced as
   network.handle or network.lunarNic_beforeOneSmallStep).  Second, a
   clean mapping between JSON and XML is easy to accomplish using the
   JSON representation.

   Clients processing JSON responses MUST be prepared for values
   specified in this document to be absent from a response as no JSON
   value listed in this document is required to appear in the response.
   In other words, servers MAY remove values as is needed by the
   policies of the server operator.

4.  Responses

   As specified in RIR-QUERY [I-D.newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query],
   queries for resources and information can be made for three types of
   information: 1) information about IP networks, 2) information about
   autonomous system numbers, and 3) information about reverse DNS
   delegations.  Queries for each of these three types can be
   constructed to target specific information:

   o  operator information (e.g. "/operator")

   o  contacts of the operator (e.g "/operator/contacts")

   o  specific types of contacts of the operator (e.g. "/operator/
      contacts/abuse")

   o  registration information about the networks, AS numbers, or DNS
      delegations (e.g. "/registration")

   o  all of the above (e.g. "/")

4.1.  IP Networks

   The following is an elided example of a JSON [RFC4627] response
   object to a query for both registration and operator information of
   an IP network


   {
     "network":
     {
       ...
     },
     "operator":
     {
       ...
     }
   }


                                 Figure 1

   The "network" member, which may be queried for directly as the
   registration information (i.e. "/registration") of the IP network is
   described below.

   The following is an example of the JSON object for the network
   registration information


   {
     "handle" : "XXXX-RIR",
     "startAddress" : "10.0.0.0",
     "endAddress" : "10.0.0.255",
     "ipVersion" : 4,
     "name": "NET-RTR-1",
     "description" : [ "A network used for routing" ],
     "type" : "DIRECT ALLOCATION",
     "country" : "AU",
     "parentHandle" : "YYYY-RIR",
     "remarks" : [
       "she sells seas shells",
       "down by the seashore"
     ],
     "uris" : [
       {
         "type" : "source",
         "uri" : "http://whois-rws.net/network/xxxx"
       },
       {
         "type" : "parent",
         "uri" : "http://whois-rws.net/network/yyyy"
       },
       {
         "type" : "held",
         "uri" : "http://example.net/location/xxxx"
       }
     ],
     "registrationDate" : "20110509",
     "lastChangedDate" : "20110509",
     "lastChangedBy" : "joe@bob.com"
   }


   The following is a description of the members of this object:

   handle  -- a string representing an RIR unique identifier of the
      network registration

   startAddress  -- the starting IP address of the network, either IPv4
      [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC5952]

Internet-Draft         RIR RESTful JSON RESPONSES             March 2012


   endAddress  -- the ending IP address of the network, either IPv4 or
      IPv6

   ipVersion  -- an integer signifying the IP protocol version of the
      network: 4 signifying an IPv4 network, 6 signifing an IPv6 network

   name  -- an identifier assigned to the network registration by the
      registration holder

   description  -- an array of strings containing descriptive text about
      the network registration

   type  -- a string containing an RIR specific classification of the
      network

   country  -- a string containing the name of the country of the
      network which MAY be in ISO 3166 2 character code [ISO.3166.1988]
      format

   parendHandle  -- a string containing an RIR unique identifier of the
      parent network of this network registration

   The members "remarks", "uris", "registrationDate", "lastChangedDate",
   and "lastChangedBy" take the same form of the members of the same
   name of the entity object (Section 5).

   The "operator" member of Figure 1, which maybe queried for directly
   using the "/operator" path, is described below.

Internet-Draft         RIR RESTful JSON RESPONSES             March 2012


   The following is an elided example of a JSON response object for
   operator information


   {
     "entity":
     {
       ...
     },
     "contacts":
     {
       "tech": [
         ...
       ],
       "admin": [
         ...
       ],
       "abuse": [
         ...
       ]
     }
   }


                                 Figure 2

   The "entity" member of Figure 2 is an object and is specified in
   Section 5.  The "contacts" member is an object containing three
   arrays: "tech", "admin", and "abuse".  Each of these arrays contains
   entities (Section 5).  That is, the "tech" array contains entity
   objects, each representing a tech contact, etc...

4.2.  Autonomous Systems

   An autonomous number query for both the registration and operator
   and/or contact information yields an object containing an "autnum"
   member and an "operator" member.  The "operator" member is as
   specified in Section 4.1.  Additionally, queries specifically for the
   operator and/or contact information take the same form as in
   Section 4.1.

   The "autnum" member mentioned above as well as queries directly for
   the registration information take the form of a JSON [RFC4627]
   object.

   The following is an example of a JSON object representing an autnum.


   {
     "handle" : "XXXX-RIR",
     "startAutnum" : "10",
     "endAutnum" : "15",
     "name": "AS-RTR-1",
     "description" : [ "AS for Exchange" ],
     "type" : "DIRECT ALLOCATION",
     "country": "AU",
     "remarks" : [
       "she sells seas shells",
       "down by the seashore"
     ],
     "uris" : [
       {
         "type" : "source",
         "uri" : "http://whois-rws.net/autnum/xxxx"
       },
       {
         "type" : "parent",
         "uri" : "http://whois-rws.net/autnum/yyyy"
       },
       {
         "type" : "held",
         "uri" : "http://example.net/location/xxxx"
       }
     ],
     "registrationDate" : "20110509",
     "lastChangedDate" : "20110509",
     "lastChangedBy" : "joe@bob.com"
   }


   The following is a description of the members of this object:

   handle  -- a string representing an RIR unique identifier of the
      autnum registration

   startAutnum  -- the starting number [RFC5396] in the block of
      autonomous system numbers

   endAutnum  -- the ending number [RFC5396] in the block of autonomous
      system numbers

   name  an identifier assigned to the autnum registration by the
      registration holder

   description  -- an array of strings containing descriptive text about
      the autnum registration

   type  -- a string containing an RIR specific classification of the
      autnum

   country  -- a string containing the name of the country of the autnum
      which MAY be in ISO 3166 2 character code [ISO.3166.1988] format

   The members "remarks", "uris", "registrationDate", "lastChangedDate",
   and "lastChangedBy" take the same form of the members of the same
   name of the entity object (Section 5).

4.3.  Reverse DNS

   A reverse DNS delegation query for both the registration and operator
   and/or contact information yields an object containing an "rdns"
   member and an "operator" member.  The "operator" member is as
   specified in Section 4.1.  Additionally, queries specifically for the
   operator and/or contact information take the same form as in
   Section 4.1.

   The "rdns" member mentioned above as well as queries directly for the
   reverse DNS information take the form of a JSON [RFC4627] object.

5.  The Entity Object

   Throughout this document there is a need to represent the identity
   and contact information of organizations, corporations, governments,
   non-profits, clubs, individual persons, and informal groups of
   people.  All of these representations are so similar that it is best
   to represent them in JSON [RFC4627] with one construct, the entity
   object, to aid in the re-use of code by implementers.

   The following is an example of an entity:


       {
         "handle" : "XXXX-RIR",
         "names": [ "Joe Bob, Inc.", "Bobby Joe Shopping" ],
         "postalAddress" : [
           "123 Maple Ave",
           "Suite 90001",
