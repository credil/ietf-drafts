Introduction   Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems enable the   measurement, configuration, and control of energy, gas and water   consumption and distribution, through two-way scheduled, on   exception, and on-demand communication.  AMI networks are composed of   millions of endpoints, including meters, distribution automation   elements, and home area network devices.  They are typically inter-   connected using some combination of wireless technologies and power-   line communications, along with a backhaul network providing   connectivity to "command-and-control" management software   applications at the utility company back office.1.1.  Requirements Language   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].1.2.

(For instance, the   AMI document tries to cover both line-powered urban metering   networks, and energy-constrained metering networks, and also tries to   deal with rural requirements.

Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL)Popa, Gillmore, ToutainExpiresRDecember 31, 2013                [Page 3]
Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   RPL provides routing functionality for mesh networks that can scale   up to thousands of resource-constrained devices, interconnected by   low power and lossy links, and communicating with the external   network infrastructure through a common aggregation point(s) (e.g., a   LBR).  RPL builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) routing structure   rooted at the LBR, ensures loop-free routing, and provides support   for alternate routes, as well as, for a wide range of routing metrics   and policies.  RPL was designed to operate in energy-constrained   environments and includes energy-saving mechanisms (e.g., Trickle   timers) and energy- aware metrics.  RPL's ability to support multiple   different metrics and constraints at the same time enables it to run   efficiently in heterogeneous networks composed of nodes and links   with vastly different characteristics [RFC6551].  This document   describes the applicability of RPL (as defined in [RFC6550]) to AMI   deployments.  RPL was designed to meet the following application   requirements:   o  Routing Requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks      [RFC5548].   o  Industrial Routing Requirements in Low-Power and Lossy Networks      [RFC5673].   o  Home Automation Routing Requirements in Low-Power and Lossy      Networks [RFC5826].   o  Building Automation Routing Requirements in Low-Power and Lossy      Networks [RFC5867].   The Routing Requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks are   applicable to AMI networks as well.  The terminology used in this   document is defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology].3.  Advanced Metering Infrastructure Description3.1.

Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   In many deployments, in addition to measuring energy consumption, the   electric meter network plays a central role in the Smart Grid since   the device enables the utility company to control and query the   electric meters themselves and can serve as a backhaul for all other   devices in the Smart Grid, e.g., water and gas meters, distribution   automation and home area network devices.  Electric meters may also   be used as sensors to monitor electric grid quality and to support   applications such as Electric Vehicle charging.  Electric meter   networks are composed with up to millions of smart meters (or nodes),   each of which is resource-constrained in terms of processing power,   storage capabilities, and communication bandwidth, due to a   combination of factors including Federal Communications Commission   (FCC) or other continents' regulations on spectrum use, American   National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards or other continents'   regulation on meter behavior and performance, on heat emissions   within the meter, form factor and cost considerations.  These   constraints result in a compromise between range and throughput, with   effective link throughput of tens to a few hundred kilobits per   second per link, a potentially significant portion of which is taken   up by protocol and encryption overhead when strong security measures   are in place.  Electric meters are often interconnected into multi-   hop mesh networks, each of which is connected to a backhaul network   leading to the utility company network through a network aggregation   point, e.g., an LBR (LLN Border Router).3.2.  Gas and Water metering   While electric meters typically consume electricity from the same   electric feed that they are monitoring, gas and water meters   typically run on a modest source of stored energy (e.g., batteries).Popa, Gillmore, ToutainExpiresRDecember 31, 2013                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   In some scenarios, gas and water meters are integrated into the same   AMI network as the electric meters and may operate as network   endpoints (rather than routers) in order to prolong their own   lifetime.  In other scenarios, however, such meters may not have the   luxury of relying on a fully powered AMI routing infrastructure but   must communicate through a dedicated infrastructure to reach a LBR.   This infrastructure can be either powered by the electricity grid, by   battery-based devices, or ones relying on alternative sources of   energy (e.g., solar power).4.  Deployment Scenario4.1.  General Considerations on Network Topology   AMI networks are composed of millions of endpoints distributed across   both urban and rural environments.  Such endpoints include electric,   gas, and water meters, distribution automation elements, and home   area network devices.  Devices in the network communicate directly   with other devices in close proximity using a variety of low-power   and/or lossy link technologies that are both wireless and wired   (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.15.4(g+e), IEEE P1901.2, and IEEE   802.11).  In addition to serving as sources and destinations of   packets, many network elements typically also forward packets and   thus form a mesh topology.4.1.1.  Networks of Electric Meters   In a typical AMI deployment, groups of meters within physical   proximity form routing domains, each in the order of a 1,000 to   10,000 meters.  Thus, each electric meter mesh typically has several   thousand wireless endpoints, with densities varying based on the area   and the terrain.  For example, apartment buildings in urban centers   may have hundreds of meters in close proximity, whereas rural areas   may have sparse node distributions and include nodes that only have a   small number of network neighbors.  Each routing domain is connected   to the larger IP infrastructure through one or more LBRs, which   provide Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity through various   traditional network technologies, e.g., Ethernet, cellular, private   WAN.  Paths in the mesh between a network node and the nearest LBR   may be composed of several hops or even several tens of hops.   Powered from the main line, electric meters have less energy   constraints than battery powered devices, such as gas and water   meters, and can afford the additional resources required to route   packets.  In mixed environments, electric meters can provide the   routing topology while gas and water meters can operate as leaf   nodes.  Electric meter networks may also serve as transit networks   for other types of devices, including distribution automation   elements (e.g., sensors and actuators), and in-home devices.  These   other devices may utilize a different link-layer technology than the   one used in the meter network.  The routing protocol operating in   networks with the topology characteristics described above needs to   be able to scale with network size and number of forwarding hops, and   have the ability to handle a wide range of network densities.Popa, Gillmore, ToutainExpiresRDecember 31, 2013                [Page 6]
Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 20134.1.2.  Networks of Gas/Water Meters   In the absence of a co-located electric meter network, gas and water   meters must either connect directly to the larger IP network   infrastructure or rely on a dedicated routing infrastructure.   Deploying such infrastructures is a challenging task as the routing   devices can sometimes only be placed in specific locations and thus   do not always have access to a continuous energy source.  Battery-   operated or energy-harvesting (e.g., equipped with solar panels)   routers are thus often used in these kinds of scenarios.  Due to the   expected lifetime (10 to 20 years) of such networks and their   reliance on alternative sources of energy, energy consumption needs   to be taken into account when designing and deploying them.  There   are a number of challenging trade-offs and considerations that exist   in that respect.  One such consideration is that managing a higher   number of meters per router leads to increased energy consumption.   However, increasing the number of routers in the network and thus   reducing the number of meters managed by each router increases   deployment and maintenance costs.  At the same time, the use of a   sparser routing infrastructure necessitates the use of higher   transmit power levels at nodes in the network, which causes increased   energy consumption.  The deployment and operational needs of energy-   constrained network infrastructure require the use of routing   mechanisms that take into account energy consumption, minimize energy   use and prolong network lifetime.5.  Smart Grid Traffic Description5.1.  Traffic Characteristics5.1.1.  Smart Metering Data TrafficPopa, Gillmore, ToutainExpiresRDecember 31, 2013                [Page 7]
Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   In current AMI deployments, metering applications typically require   all smart meters to communicate with a few head-end servers, deployed   in the utility company data center.  Head-end servers generate data   traffic to configure smart metering devices or initiate queries, and   use unicast and multicast to efficiently communicate with a single   device or groups of devices respectively (i.e., Point-to-Multipoint   (P2MP) communication).  The head-end server may send a single small   packet at a time to the meters (e.g., a meter read request, a small   configuration change, service switch command) or a series of large   packets (e.g., a firmware upgrade across one or even thousands of   devices).  The frequency of large file transfers, e.g., firmware   upgrade of all metering devices, is typically much lower than the   frequency of sending configuration messages or queries.  Each smart   meter generates Smart Metering Data (SMD) traffic according to a   schedule (e.g., periodic meter reads), in response to on-demand   queries (e.g., on-demand meter reads), or in response to some local   event (e.g., power outage, leak detection).  Such traffic is   typically destined to a single head-end server.  The bulk of the SMD   traffic tends to be directed towards the LBR, both in terms of bytes   (since reports are typically much larger than queries) and in terms   of number of packets, e.g., some reports have to be split into   multiple packets due to packet size limitations, periodic reports can   be sent without requiring a query to be sent for each one first,   unsolicited events like alarms and outage notifications are only   generated by the meters and sent towards the LBR.  The SMD traffic is   thus highly asymmetric, where the majority of the traffic volume   generated by the smart meters typically goes through the LBRs, and is   directed from the smart meter devices to the head-end servers, in a   Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P) fashion.  Current SMD traffic patterns are   fairly uniform and well-understood.  The traffic generated by the   head-end server and destined to metering devices is dominated by   periodic meter reads, while traffic generated by the metering devices   is typically uniformly spread over some periodic read time-window.   Smart metering applications typically do not have hard real-time   constraints, but they are often subject to bounded latency and   stringent reliability service level agreements.  From a routing   perspective, SMD applications require efficient P2MP communication   between the devices in the network and one or more LBRs.  In   addition, timely loop resolution and broken link repair are needed to   meet latency requirements.  Finally, the availability of redundant   paths is important for increasing network reliability.5.1.2.  Distribution Automation Traffic   Distribution Automation (DA) applications typically involve a small   number of devices that communicate with each other in a Point-to-   Point (P2P) fashion, and may or may not be in close physical   proximity.  DA applications typically have more stringent latency   requirements than SMD applications.5.1.3.

Using RPL to Meet Functional Requirements   The functional requirements for most AMI deployments are similar to   those listed in [RFC5548]:   o  The routing protocol MUST be capable of supporting the      organization of a large number of nodes into regions containing on      the order of 10^2 to 10^4 nodes each.   o  The routing protocol MUST provide mechanisms to support      configuration of the routing protocol itself.Popa, Gillmore, ToutainExpiresRDecember 31, 2013                [Page 9]
Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   o  The routing protocol SHOULD support and utilize the large number      of highly directed flows to a few head-end servers to handle      scalability.   o  The routing protocol MUST dynamically compute and select effective      routes composed of low-power and lossy links.  Local network      dynamics SHOULD NOT impact the entire network.  The routing      protocol MUST compute multiple paths when possible.   o  The routing protocol MUST support multicast and unicast      addressing.  The routing protocol SHOULD support formation and      identification of groups of field devices in the network.   RPL supports the following features:   o  Scalability: Large-scale networks characterized by highly directed      traffic flows between each smart meter and the head-end servers in      the utility network.  To this end, RPL builds a Directed Acyclic      Graph (DAG) rooted at each LBR.   o  Zero-touch configuration:  This is done through in-band methods      for configuring RPL variables using DIO messages, and DIO message      options.   o  The use of links with time-varying quality characteristics:  This      is accomplished by allowing the use of metrics that effectively      capture the quality of a path (e.g., Expected Transmission Count      (ETX)) and by limiting the impact of changing local conditions by      discovering and maintaining multiple DAG parents, and by using      local repair mechanisms when DAG links break.9.

Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   multiple RPL instances can be supported in multi-service networks   where different applications may require the use of different routing   metrics and constraints, e.g., a network carrying both SDM and DA   traffic.9.1.2.  Storing vs.  Non-Storing Mode   In most scenarios, electric meters are powered by the grid they are   monitoring and are not energy-constrained.  Instead, electric meters   have hardware and communication capacity constraints that are   primarily determined by cost, and secondarily by power consumption.   As a result, different AMI deployments can vary significantly in   terms of memory size, computation power and communication   capabilities.  For this reason, the use of RPL storing or non-storing   mode SHOULD be deployment specific.  When meters are memory   constrained and cannot adequately store the route tables necessary to   support hop-by-hop routing, RPL non-storing mode SHOULD be preferred.   On the other hand, when nodes are capable of storing such routing   tables, the use of storing mode may lead to reduced overhead and   route repair latency.  However, in high-density environments, storing   routes can be challenging because some nodes may have to maintain   routing information for a large number of descendents.  When the   routing table size becomes challenging, it is RECOMMENDED that nodes   perform route aggregation, similarly to the approach taken by other   routing protocols, although the required set of mechanism may differ.9.1.3.  DAO Policy   Two-way communication is a requirement in AMI systems.  As a result,   nodes SHOULD send DAO messages to establish downward paths from the   root to themselves.9.1.4.  Path Metrics   Smart metering deployments utilize link technologies that may exhibit   significant packet loss and thus require routing metrics that take   packet loss into account.  To characterize a path over such link   technologies, AMI deployments can use the Expected Transmission Count   (ETX) metric as defined in [RFC6551].   For water and gas meter networks that do not rely on powered   infrastructure, simpler metrics that require less energy to compute   would be more appropriate.  In particular, a combination of hop count   and link quality can satisfy this requirement.  As minimizing energy   consumption is critical in these types of networks, available node   energy should also be used in conjunction with these two metrics.Popa, Gillmore, ToutainExpiresRDecember 31, 2013               [Page 11]
Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   The usage of additional metrics specifically designed for such   networks may be defined in companion RFCs, e.g., [RFC6551].9.1.5.  Objective Function   RPL relies on an Objective Function for selecting parents and   computing path costs and rank.  This objective function is decoupled   from the core RPL mechanisms and also from the metrics in use in the   network.  Two objective functions for RPL have been defined at the   time of this writing, OF0 and MRHOF, both of which define the   selection of a preferred parent and backup parents, and are suitable   for AMI deployments.  Neither of the currently defined objective   functions supports multiple metrics that might be required in   heterogeneous networks (e.g., networks composed of devices with   different energy constraints) or combination of metrics that might be   required for water- and gas-only networks.  Additional objective   functions specifically designed for such networks may be defined in   companion RFCs.9.1.6.  DODAG Repair   To effectively handle time-varying link characteristics and   availability, AMI deployments SHOULD utilize the local repair   mechanisms in RPL.  Local repair is triggered by broken link   detection and in storing mode by loop detection as well.  The first   local repair mechanism consists of a node detaching from a DODAG and   then re-attaching to the same or to a different DODAG at a later   time.  While detached, a node advertises an infinite rank value so   that its children can select a different parent.  This process is   known as poisoning and is described in Section 8.2.2.5 of [RFC6550].   While RPL provides an option to form a local DODAG, doing so in AMI   deployments is of little benefit since AMI applications typically   communicate through a LBR.  After the detached node has made   sufficient effort to send notification to its children that it is   detached, the node can rejoin the same DODAG with a higher rank   value.  The configured duration of the poisoning mechanism needs to   take into account the disconnection time applications running over   the network can tolerate.  Note that when joining a different DODAG,   the node need not perform poisoning.  The second local repair   mechanism controls how much a node can increase its rank within a   given DODAG Version (e.g., after detaching from the DODAG as a result   of broken link or loop detection).  Setting the DAGMaxRankIncrease to   a non-zero value enables this mechanism, and setting it to a value of   less than infinity limits the cost of count-to-infinity scenarios   when they occur, thus controlling the duration of disconnection   applications may experience.9.1.7.  MulticastPopa, Gillmore, ToutainExpiresRDecember 31, 2013               [Page 12]
Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   RPL defines multicast support for its storing mode of operation,   where the DODAG structure built for unicast packet dissemination is   used for multicast distribution as well.  In particular, multicast   forwarding state creation is done through DAO messages with multicast   target options sent along the DODAG towards the root.  Thereafter   nodes with forwarding state for a particular group forward multicast   packets along the DODAG by copying them to all children from which   they have received a DAO with a multicast target option for the   group.  Multicast support for RPL in non-storing mode will be defined   in companion RFCs.9.1.8.  Security   AMI deployments operate in areas that do not provide any physical   security.  For this reason, the link layer, transport layer and   application layer technologies utilized within AMI networks typically   provide security mechanisms to ensure authentication,   confidentiality, integrity, and freshness.  As a result, AMI   deployments may not need to implement RPL's security mechanisms and   could rely on link layer and higher layer security features.9.1.9.  P2P communications   Distribution Automation and other emerging applications may require   efficient P2P communications.  Basic P2P capabilities are already   defined in the RPL  [RFC6550].  Additional mechanisms for efficient   P2P communication are being developed in companion RFCs (see [I-D   .draft-ietf-roll-p2p-rpl-17]).9.2.  Description of Layer-two features9.2.1.

Trickle Parameters   Trickle was designed to be density-aware and perform well in networks   characterized by a wide range of node densities.  The combination of   DIO packet suppression and adaptive timers for sending updates allows   Trickle to perform well in both sparse and dense environments.  Node   densities in AMI deployments can vary greatly, from nodes having only   one or a handful of neighbors to nodes having several hundred   neighbors.  In high density environments, relatively low values for   Imin may cause a short period of congestion when an inconsistency is   detected and DIO updates are sent by a large number of neighboring   nodes nearly simultaneously.  While the Trickle timer will   exponentially backoff, some time may elapse before the congestion   subsides.  While some link layers employ contention mechanisms that   attempt to avoid congestion, relying solely on the link layer to   avoid congestion caused by a large number of DIO updates can result   in increased communication latency for other control and data traffic   in the network.  To mitigate this kind of short-term congestion, this   document recommends a more conservative set of values for the Trickle   parameters than those specified in [RFC6206].  In particular,   DIOIntervalMin is set to a larger value to avoid periods of   congestion in dense environments, and DIORedundancyConstant is   parameterized accordingly as described below.  These values are   appropriate for the timely distribution of DIO updates in both sparse   and dense scenarios while avoiding the short-term congestion that   might arise in dense scenarios.  Because the actual link capacity   depends on the particular link technology used within an AMI   deployment, the Trickle parameters are specified in terms of the   link's maximum capacity for transmitting link-local multicast   messages.  If the link can transmit m link-local multicast packets   per second on average, the expected time it takes to transmit a link-   local multicast packet is 1/m seconds.   DIOIntervalMin: AMI deployments SHOULD set DIOIntervalMin such that      the Trickle Imin is at least 50 times as long as it takes to      transmit a link-local multicast packet.  This value is larger than      that recommended in  [RFC6206] to avoid congestion in dense urban      deployments as described above.  In energy-constrained deployments      (e.g., in water and gas battery-based routing infrastructure),      DIOIntervalMin MAY be set to a value resulting in a Trickle Imin      of several (e.g.  2) hours.   DIOIntervalDoublings: AMI deployments SHOULD set DIOIntervalDoublings      such that the Trickle Imax is at least 2 hours or more.  For very      energy constrained deployments (e.g., water and gas battery-based      routing infrastructure), DIOIntervalDoublings MAY be set to a      value resulting in a Trickle Imax of several (e.g., 2) days.Popa, Gillmore, ToutainExpiresRDecember 31, 2013               [Page 14]
Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   DIORedundancyConstant: AMI deployments SHOULD set      DIORedundancyConstant to a value of at least 10.  This is due to      the larger chosen value for DIOIntervalMin and the proportional      relationship between Imin and k suggested in [RFC6206].  This      increase is intended to compensate for the increased communication      latency of DIO updates caused by the increase in the      DIOIntervalMin value, though the proportional relationship between      Imin and k suggested in  [RFC6206] is not preserved.  Instead,      DIORedundancyConstant is set to a lower value in order to reduce      the number of packet transmissions in dense environments.9.4.2.  Other Parameters   o  AMI deployments SHOULD set MinHopRankIncrease to 256, resulting in      8 bits of resolution (e.g., for the ETX metric).   o  To enable local repair, AMI deployments SHOULD set MaxRankIncrease      to a value that allows a device to move a small number of hops      away from the root.  With a MinHopRankIncrease of 256, a      MaxRankIncrease of 1024 would allow a device to move up to 4 hops      away.10.  Manageability ConsiderationsPopa, Gillmore, ToutainExpiresRDecember 31, 2013               [Page 15]
Internet-Draft         RPL Applicability for AMI               July 2013   Network manageability is a critical aspect of smart grid network   deployment and operation.  With millions of devices participating in   the smart grid network, many requiring real-time reachability,   automatic configuration, and lightweight network health monitoring   and management are crucial for achieving network availability and   efficient operation.  RPL enables automatic and consistent   configuration of RPL routers through parameters specified by the   DODAG root and disseminated through DIO packets.  The use of Trickle   for scheduling DIO transmissions ensures lightweight yet timely   propagation of important network and parameter updates and allows   network operators to choose the trade-off point they are comfortable   with respect to overhead vs.  reliability and timeliness of network   updates.  The metrics in use in the network along with the Trickle   Timer parameters used to control the frequency and redundancy of   network updates can be dynamically varied by the root during the   lifetime of the network.  To that end, all DIO messages SHOULD   contain a Metric Container option for disseminating the metrics and   metric values used for DODAG setup.  In addition, DIO messages SHOULD   contain a DODAG Configuration option for disseminating the Trickle   Timer parameters throughout the network.  The possibility of   dynamically updating the metrics in use in the network as well as the   frequency of network updates allows deployment characteristics (e.g.,   network density) to be discovered during network bring-up and to be   used to tailor network parameters once the network is operational   rather than having to rely on precise pre- configuration.  This also   allows the network parameters and the overall routing protocol   behavior to evolve during the lifetime of the network.  RPL specifies   a number of variables and events that can be tracked for purposes of   network fault and performance monitoring of RPL routers.  Depending   on the memory and processing capabilities of each smart grid device,   various subsets of these can be employed in the field.11.  Security Considerations   Smart grid networks are subject to stringent security requirements as   they are considered a critical infrastructure component.  At the same   time, since they are composed of large numbers of resource-   constrained devices inter-connected with limited-throughput links,   many available security mechanisms are not practical for use in such   networks.  As a result, the choice of security mechanisms is highly   dependent on the device and network capabilities characterizing a   particular deployment.  In contrast to other types of LLNs, in smart   grid networks centralized administrative control and access to a   permanent secure infrastructure is available.  As a result link-   layer, transport-layer and/or application-layer security mechanisms   are typically in place and using RPL's secure mode is not necessary.11.1.
