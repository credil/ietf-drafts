                  Radius Attributes for Stateful NAT64
              draft-chen-behave-nat64-radius-extension-00

Abstract

   This document proposes new radius attributes for stateful NAT64.  The
   extensions are used to provide geo-location services with an exact
   IPv6 soruce address.  The message flow to deliver the NAT64 binding
   information between radius clients and servers is also described.
   Therefore, accurate location could be traced out depending on the
   radius method.

1.  Introduction

   Stateful NAT64[RFC6146] has been specified to provide IPv4 services
   access when IPv6-only connectivity is enabled.  This NAT64 function
   could be implemented into routers or firewalls and deployed in
   broadband access networks or mobile core networks.  A public IPv4
   pool is configured in a NAT64 device to represent IPv6 subscribers in
   the IPv4 realm.  Since the public IPv4 address is shared by several
   subscribers, it's hardly for a geo-location service to retrieve
   accurate location information just depending on mapped IPv4 source
   address.  Therefore, it may impact geo-location service provisioning
   in such case due to unsatisfactory inputs.

   [RFC6269] mentions that in order to resolve the location of a host
   based on IP address, "It will be necessary for users of such systems
   to provide more information (e.g., TCP or UDP port numbers), and for
   the systems to use this information to query additional network
   resources (e.g., Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation
   (NAT-PT) binding tables)."  Current geo-location systems may rely on
   a radius database to inspect location information, for example the
   information provided in [RFC5580].  A radius based method may be
   desirable to convey original IPv6 source address in such system
   because it's rather convenient for a geo-location to get actual IPv6
   source address through the same message bus.  This document proposes
   to provide those information using radius methods.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Statement

   IP address sharing solution raises some issues dealing with the
   capability to reveal the actual source address.  A use of stateful
   NAT64 likely has same issues once geo-location systems seek an
   accurate input of a source address.  Unlike NAT44, it may make more
   significances to trace the IPv6 source address other than the mapped
   IPv4 address to locate the
   subscribers.[I-D.ietf-v6ops-nat64-experience] provided more
   descriptions on stateful NAT64 uses.  Once the stateful NAT64
   function is built at a load balancer, XFF (X-Forwarded-For)
   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-http-forwarded] is likely to be adopted to transmit
   the IPv6 source address in HTTP headers.  Those messages would be
   passed on to web-servers for the geo-location processing.  However,
   XFF only handles HTTP-based traffic and may not be implemented, for
   example if the NAT64 function is integrated within routers or
   firewall in an broadband fixed network or a mobile network.
   Requiring NAT64 devices providing some application aware functions to
   insert IPv6 source addresses for each data flow would introduce
   overwhelming complexity and performance degradation.  It's also
   possible to extend Port Control Protocol (PCP) to support those
   network information queries from external servers.  This method can
   be treated as an "out-band" approach.  However, it may require
   additional correlations between different systems.  Therefore, the
   document proposes a radius-based solution to fit into geo-location
   systems with following benefits.

   o  It has few impacts to the NAT64 performance since the radius is a
      independent system which doesn't interact with NAT64 process

   o  Geo-location systems already rely on the radius database.  The
      extended attributes could be transmitted in the same message as
      already occurs over RADIUS[RFC5580]

4.  Delivery Methods for NAT64 Binding Information

   The Figure 1 takes an example to show the message exchanges when the
   NAT64 function is implemented in a Broadband Network Gateway(BNG).

   If the RADIUS client provides a NAT64-Binding-Capable Attribute in
   the Access-Request, then the RADIUS server MAY request NAT64 Binding
   information from the RADIUS client.  The inclusion of the Location-

   Capable Attribute in an Access-Request message indicates that the BNG
   with stateful NAT64 functions is capable of providing binding
   information in response to an Access-Challenge.  The subsequent
   Access-Challenge message sent from the RADIUS server to the BNG
   provides a hint regarding the desired NAT64 Binding Attributes.  BNG
   would search the corresponding binding information regarding to
   mapped IPv4 address contained in the Requested-Binding-Info
   attribute.  In the shown message flow, the NAT64-Binding-Information
   attributes including IPv6 source address and life-time of the binding
   are then provided in the subsequent Access-Request message.
   Afterwards, RADIUS server should take a authorization procedure to
   evaluate this Access-Request message.

5.1.  NAT64-Binding-Capable

   The NAT64-Binding-Capable Attribute allows a network node with
   stateful NAT64 functions to indicate support for the functionality

   challenge for additional network information once the NAT64-Binding-
   Capable Attribute has been received.

6.  Diameter Considerations

   This attribute is usable within either RADIUS or Diameter[RFC6733] .
   Since the Attributes defined in this document will be allocated from
   the standard RADIUS type space, no special handling is required by
   Diameter entities.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the assignment of RADIUS Attribute Type in the
   "Radius Types" registry (currently located at http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/radius-types for the following attributes: o

   o  NAT64-Binding-Capable TBD

   o  Requested-Binding-Info TBD

   o  NAT64-Binding-Information TBD

   IANA should allocate the numbers from the standard RADIUS Attributes
   space using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].

8.  Security Considerations

   The proposed method is RECOMMENDED to be used with [RFC5580].
   Therefore, it shares all the considerations at Section 7 of
   [RFC5580].
