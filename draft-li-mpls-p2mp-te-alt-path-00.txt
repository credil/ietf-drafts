Abstract

   The document proposes a solution to be able to set up the alternative
   path for specific leaf nodes of a P2MP TE LSP.  Corresponding RSVP-TE
   protocol extension is also defined.  The solution is used to cope
   with the issue that in some scenarios traffic loss happens even if
   there exists possible path for the leaf nodes.

Internet-Draft      Alternative Path for P2MP TE LSP       February 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4461] presents a set of requirements for the establishment and
   maintenance of Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Traffic-Engineered (TE)
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).
   [RFC4875] defines extensions to the RSVP-TE protocol for setup of
   P2MP TE LSPs.  P2MP TE LSPs are set up with a series of traffic
   engineering constraints.  These constraints are applied to all S2L
   sub-LSPs.  This may cause the issue that some S2L sub-LSPs can be set
   up while others can not according to the constraints.  There may be
   worse case that some S2L sub-LSPs can not be restored after link
   failure according to the constraints.  When P2MP TE LSPs are used for
   specific applications, it will cause continuous traffic loss.  This
   document identifies the applicability issue and proposes the solution
   and corresponding protocol extension.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminologies defined in [RFC2205], [RFC3031],
   [RFC3209], [RFC3473], [RFC4090], [RFC4461] and [RFC4875].


3.  Problem Statement

   The P2MP TE LSP is set up with a series of traffic engineering
   constrains such as bandwidth, explicit path, affinity
   property(color), etc.  These traffic engineering constraints are
   applied to path computation for all S2L sub-LSPs.  Owing to the
   network provision some leaves of the P2MP LSP are not reachable
   according the required constraints ( it will be called primary
   constraints in the following ).  There may be the worse case that all
   leaves are reachable at the beginning and they are not reachable when
   failure happens.  In fact these leaves can be reachable if ignore
   some or all of the primary constraints .

                     Figure 1.  Constraints for P2MP TE LSP

   An example for P2MP TE LSP setup is shown in the figure 1.  A is the
   root node and F, N and M are leaf nodes.  The link with '|' means the
   link with red color and the link with '*' means the link with green
   color.  The constraint is that the link with red color should be
   chosen for the path.  For the leaf node M, the path is
   A->B->E->H->K-M.  When link between H and K fails, there is no path
   with red color can be found from A to M. This will cause the initial
   available traffic break until the link between H and K restores.  The
   continuous traffic loss can cause bad user experience if the P2MP TE
   LSP is used for IPTV or other applications.  In fact, during the
   course of failure, there is an alternative path from A to M (
   A->B->E->H->I->L->K->M ) if the link with green color can be chosen.


4.  Mechanisms

   In order to solve the above applicability issue for P2MP TE LSP,
   alternative constraints can be specified for the P2MP TE LSP to
   calculate paths to specific leaf nodes if the path with the primary
   constraints is not available.  The P2MP TE LSP is set up with some
   S2L sub-LSPs using the primary constraints while the other S2L sub-
   LSPs using the alternative constraints.  The constraints may be used
   in the downstream nodes, such as ASBR node, and the alternative
   constraints MUST be propagated to keep the consistence through
   RSVP-TE protocol extensions.

Internet-Draft      Alternative Path for P2MP TE LSP       February 2013


4.1.  Path Computation in Root Node

   When alternative constraints is allowed for a specific P2MP TE LSP in
   the root node, the node MUST try to compute paths for all leaf nodes
   using the primary constraints.  If paths with the primary constraints
   are available for all leaf nodes, the alternative constraints MUST
   NOT be used.

   When paths with the primary constraints are not available for
   specific leaf nodes, the alternative constraints SHOULD be used to
   calculate paths for these leaf nodes.  In order to get available
   paths, the alternative constraints should be looser than the primary
   constraints.  The alternative constraints can be set as zero to
   simplify the process and the best-effort path as routing is
   calculated.

   When calculate paths with the alternative constraints, the
   constraints MUST be applied to the whole S2L sub-LSP.  That is, it is
   prohibited that some parts of the S2L sub-LSP satisfies the primary
   constraints while other parts satisfies the alternative constraints.
   If the root node can not calculate the whole S2L sub-LSP ( abstract
   node exists in the calculated path ), the alternative constraints
   MUST be used in the downstream nodes path calculation.

   The root node will keep trying to re-optimize to a better path to
   meet the primary constraints, and it is outside the scope of this
   document.

4.2.  Alternative Constraints Propagation

   When setup P2MP LSP, the primary constraint is carried according to
   the RSVP-TE protocol extension which is defined in [RFC4875].  If the
   paths to specific leaf nodes are computed using alternative
   constraints, the alternative constraints MUST be carried
   corresponding to the S2L sub-LSPs to these leaf nodes in the Path
   message.  These alternative constraints corresponding to S2L sub-LSPs
   are propagated along the paths from the root node to the leaf nodes.

   Both the primary and alternative constraints may be propagated in one
   Path message. a transit node SHOULD choose the correct constraints to
   calculate the rest path.  If there are alternative constraints
   following the S2L sub-LSPs, it MUST be used when calculating for the
   S2L sub-LSPs, while the primary constraints MUST be used for the S2L
   sub-LSPs that is not followed.  This will be described in detail in
   the section 5 of RSVP-TE protocol extensions.

4.3.  Resource Reservation

   When the Resv message is propagated from the leaf nodes to the root
   node, the transit node MUST reserve resource according to the traffic
   parameters specified by the required constraints.  However, the
   common upstream node, such as A, B node in figure 1, may have
   different traffic parameters required if both the primary and
   alternative constraints exist, and the primary constraints should be
   chosen in this case.


5.  Protocol Extension

   There are two methods for RSVP-TE protocol to carry both the primary
   and alternative constraints.  One is to separate the S2L sub-LSPs
   with alternative constraints from the S2L sub-LSPs with the primary
   constraints.  The Sub-Group fields imported in [RFC4875] may evade
   the issue of section 4.2 naturally.  It is assumed that the S2L sub-
   LSPs with the primary constraints and the S2L sub-LSPs with
   alternative constraints SHOULD not be propagated in a single IP
   packet.  The other method will be described in detail in section 5.1
   Path Message Format.

5.1.  Path Message Format

   This section describes modifications made to the Path message format
   as specified in [RFC4875].  The Path message is enhanced to signal
   alternative constraints for specific S2L sub-LSPs.

    The following is the format of the S2L sub-LSP descriptor list.

    <S2L sub-LSP descriptor list> ::= <S2L sub-LSP descriptor>

                                 [ <P2MP SECONDARY_SENDER_TSPEC> ]


   In the modified Path message, S2L_SUB_LSP for specific leaf nodes can
   carry the alternative constraints besides the explicit route . <P2MP
   SECONDARY_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> and <P2MP SECONDARY_SENDER_TSPEC> are
   added to specify the alternative constraints such as resource
   affinity, setup and holding priority and traffic parameters.  The
   format of <P2MP SECONDARY_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> and <P2MP
   SECONDARY_SENDER_TSPEC> are the same as <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> defined
   by [RFC3209] and <SENDER_TSPEC> defined by [RFC2210].
