                  PW Endpoint Fast Failure Protection
              draft-shen-pwe3-endpoint-fast-protection-03

Abstract

   This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires
   (PWs) against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment
   circuit failure, egress PE failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE
   failure, and multi-segment PW switching PE failure.  Designed on the
   basis of multi-homed CE, PW redundancy, upstream label assignment and
   context specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair
   to be performed by a router upstream adjacent to a failure.  In
   particular, the router can restore PW traffic in the order of tens of
   milliseconds, by transmitting the traffic to a protector through a
   pre-established bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism can be used
   to reduce traffic loss before a global repair mechanism reacts to the
   failure or the network converges on the topology changes due to the
   failure.

Internet-Draft     PW Endpoint Fast Failure Protection     February 2013


1.  Introduction

   Per RFC 3985, RFC 4447 and RFC 5659, a pseudowire (PW) or PW segment
   can be thought of as a connection between a pair of forwarders hosted
   by two PEs, carrying an emulated layer-2 service over a packet
   switched network (PSN).  In the single-segment PW (SS-PW) case, a
   forwarder binds a PW to an attachment circuit (AC).  In the multi-
   segment PW (MS-PW) case, a forwarder on a terminating PE (T-PE) binds
   a PW segment to an AC, while a forwarder on a switching PE (S-PE)
   binds one PW segment to another PW segment.  In each direction
   between the PEs, PW packets are transported by a PSN tunnel, which is
   called a transport tunnel.

   In order to protect a layer-2 service against network failures, it is
   necessary to protect every link and node along the entire data path.
   From the perspective of the traffic in a given direction, this
   include ingress AC, ingress (T-)PE, intermediate routers of transport
   tunnel, S-PEs, egress (T-)PE, and egress AC.  To minimize service
   disruption, it is also desirable that each of these components is
   protected by a fast protection mechanism based on local repair.  Such
   a mechanism generally involves a bypass path that is pre-computed and
   pre-installed on a router upstream adjacent to a failure.  The bypass
   path has the property that it can guide traffic around the failure,
   while remaining unaffected by the topology changes resulting from the
   failure.  When the failure happens, the router can invoke the bypass
   path to achieve fast restoration for the service.

   Today, fast protection against ingress AC failure and ingress (T-)PE
   failure is achievable by using a multi-homed CE and redundant PWs.
   Fast protection against failure of intermediate router is achievable
   through RSVP fast-reroute (RFC 4090) and IP/LDP fast-reroute (RFC
   5714 and RFC 5286).  However, there is a lack of such protection
   against egress AC failure, egress (T-)PE failure, and S-PE failure.
   In these cases, service restoration has to rely on global repair or
   control plane repair.  Global repair is normally driven by ingress CE
   or ingress (T-)PE, and dependent on status notification or end-to-end
   OAM.  Control plane repair is dependent on protocol convergence.
   Therefore, both mechanisms are relatively slow in reacting to
   failures and restoring traffic.

   This document intends to serve the exact need for the above.  It
   specifies a fast protection mechanism based on local repair technique
   to protect PWs against the following egress endpoint failures.

   a.  Egress AC failure.

   b.  Egress PE failure: Node failure of an egress PE of a SS-PW; Node
       failure of a T-PE of an MS-PW.

Internet-Draft     PW Endpoint Fast Failure Protection     February 2013


   c.  Switching PE failure: Node failure of an S-PE of an MS-PW.

   The mechanism is applicable to LDP signaled PWs.  It is relevant to
   networks with redundant PWs and multi-homed CEs.  It is designed on
   the basis of MPLS upstream label assignment and context specific
   label switching (RFC 5331).  Fast protection refers to the ability to
   restore traffic upon a failure in the order of tens of milliseconds.
   This is achieved by establishing local protection at the router
   upstream adjacent to the failure.  Compared with the existing global
   repair and control plane repair mechanisms, this mechanism can
   provide faster restoration.  However, it is intended to complement
   those mechanisms, rather than replacing them in any way.


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


3.  Reference Models and Failure Cases

   This document refers to the following topologies to describe failure
   scenarios and protection procedures.  These topologies involve multi-
   homed CEs and redundant PWs which are commonly seen in networks with
   a global repair mechanism.  In this document, the fast protection
   mechanism will also take advantage of them for local repair purposes.
   This SHALL enable local repair and global repair to work in tandem to
   achieve broader scope and better performance for protection.

                                 Figure 1

   In Figure 1, the IP/MPLS network consists of PE-routers and
   P-routers.  It provides an emulation of a layer-2 service between CE1
   and CE2.

   Each CE is multi-homed to two PEs.  Hence, there are two divergent
   paths between the CEs.  The first path uses PW1 established between
   PE1 and PE2, connecting the AC CE1-PE1 and the AC CE2-PE2.  The
   second path uses PW2 established between PE3 and PE4, connecting the
   AC CE1-PE3 and the AC CE2-PE4.  The operational states of all the PWs
   and ACs are up.  The transport tunnels of the PWs are not shown in
   this figure for clarity.

   At any given time, each CE sends traffic via only one AC and receives
   traffic via only one AC.  The two ACs MAY or MAY NOT be the same.
   The AC used to send traffic is determined by the CE, and MAY rely on
   an end-to-end OAM mechanism between the CEs.  The AC used for the CE
   to receive traffic is determined by the state of the network and the
   protection mechanism in use, as described later in this document.

   From the perspective of traffic towards a given CE, the set of PWs,
   PEs and ACs involved can be viewed to serve primary and backup (or
   active and standby) roles.  When the network is in a steady state,
   the PW that is intended to carry the traffic is referred to as a
   primary PW.  The PE at the egress of the primary PW is a primary PE.
   The AC connecting the CE and the primary PE is a primary AC.  The
   other PW that may be used to carry the traffic upon a network failure
   are referred to as a backup PW.  The PE at the egress of the backup
   PW is a backup PE.  The AC connecting the CE and the backup PE is a
   backup AC.

   In this document, the following primary and backup roles are assigned

   for the traffic going from CE1 to CE2:

      Primary PW: PW1

      Primary PE: PE2

      Primary AC: CE2-PE2

      Backup PW: PW2

      Backup PE: PE4

      Backup AC: CE2-PE4

   In this case, an egress AC failure refers to the failure of the AC
   CE2-PE2.  An egress node failure refers to the failure of PE2.

   The backup PE, backup PW and backup AC may be used to carry the
   traffic when CE1 and CE2 switches traffic to PW2 during global
   repair, or when a local repair takes effect, as described later in
   this document.

                      ------------- P2 ---------------- PE4 -

                    |<-------------- PW2 --------------->|

                                 Figure 2

   Figure 2 shows another possible scenario, where CE1 is single-homed
   to PE1, while CE2 remains multi-homed to PE2 and PE4.  From the
   perspective of egress protection for the traffic from CE1 to CE2,
   this topology is not different than Figure 1.  However, for the
   traffic in the direction from CE2 to CE1, PE1 must anticipate traffic
   on both PW1 and PW2, and sends it to CE1 over the AC CE1-PE1.

                  |<----- SEG3 ----->|<----- SEG4 ----->|
                  |<--------------- PW2 --------------->|

                                 Figure 3

   Figure 3 shows a topology that is similar to Figure 1 but in an MS-PW
   environment.  PW1 and PW2 are both MS-PWs.  PW1 is established
   between TPE1 and TPE2, and switched between segments SEG1 and SEG2 at
   SPE1.  PW2 is established between TPE3 and TPE4, and switched between
   segments SEG3 and SEG4 at SPE2.  CE1 is multi-homed to TPE1 and TPE3.
   CE2 is multi-homed to TPE2 and TPE4.  The transport tunnels of the PW
   segments are not shown in this figure for clarity.

   In this document, the following primary and backup roles are assigned
   for the traffic going from CE1 to CE2:

      Primary PW: PW1

      Primary T-PE: TPE2

      Primary S-PE: SPE1

      Primary AC: CE2-TPE2

      Backup PW: PW2

      Backup T-PE: TPE4

      Backup S-PE: SPE2

      Backup AC: CE2-TPE4

   In this case, an egress AC failure refers to the failure of the AC
   CE2-TPE2.  An egress node failure refers to the failure of TPE2.  An

   switching node failure refers to the failure of SPE1.

   The backup T-PE, backup PW and backup AC are used for protecting the
   primary PW against egress AC failure and egress node failure.  The
   backup S-PE and the backup PW are used for protecting the primary PW
   against switching node failure, as described later in this document.

   For consistency with the SS-PW scenario, primary T-PEs and a primary
   S-PEs may simply be referred to as primary PEs in this document,
   where specifics is not required.  Similarly, backup T-PEs and backup
   S-PEs may be referred to as backup PEs.


4.  Theory of Operation

   The fast protection mechanism in this document provides three types
   of protection for PWs, corresponding to the three types of failures
   described in Section 1.

   a.  Egress AC protection

   b.  Egress (T-)PE node protection

   c.  S-PE node protection

   The mechanism assumes that the target CE is multi-homed to a primary
   PE and a backup PE, and there is a backup PW in the network.  In S-PE
   node protection, it also assumes that there is a backup S-PE on the
   backup PW.

4.1.  Local Repair and Protector

   The mechanism relies on local repair to be performed by routers
   upstream adjacent to failures.  Each of these routers is referred to
   as a "point of local repair" (PLR).  A PLR MUST be able to detect a
   failure by using a rapid mechanism, such as physical layer failure
   detection, Bidirectional Failure Detection (BFD) (RFC 5880), etc.  In
   anticipation of the failure, the PLR MUST also pre-establish a bypass
   PSN tunnel to a "protector", and pre-install a bypass route in the
   FIB (forwarding information base).  The bypass tunnel has the
   property that it is not affected by the topology changes caused by
   the failure.  Upon detecting the failure, the PLR MUST invoke the
   bypass route and forward PW traffic to the protector through the
   bypass tunnel.  The protector MUST in turn send the traffic to the
   target CE, which may or may not be directly attached to the
   protector.  This procedure is referred to as local repair.

   Different routers may serve as PLR and protector in different

   scenarios.

   o  In egress AC protection, the PLR is the primary PE that hosts the
      primary AC, and the protector is the backup PE (Figure 4).

                                   Figure 6

   In all scenarios, when a PLR forwards traffic through a bypass tunnel
   to a protector, it keeps the label of the primary PW intact.  This
   obviates the need for the PLR to maintain forwarding state on a
   per-PW basis, and allows the bypass tunnel to protect multiple
   primary PWs.

   This also means that the protector MUST forward the traffic based on
   a PW label that is assigned by the primary PE, and ensure that the
   traffic eventually reach the target CE.  From the protector's
   perspective, the PW label is an upstream assigned label (RFC 5331).
   This is accomplished by learning the PW label from the primary PE,
   installing proper forwarding state for the PW label in the label
   space of the primary PE, and performing PW label lookup in this label
   space.

   In the above examples, the protectors are backup (S-)PEs.  A
   protector may also be a dedicated router that assumes such a role.
   In this case, the protector may not be the backup (S-)PE of a given
   primary PW.  During local repair, a PLR still sends traffic to the
   protector through a bypass tunnel.  The protector then sends the
   traffic to the backup (S-)PE, which finally sends the traffic to the
   target CE via a backup AC or a backup PW segment.  More detail will
   be described in Section 4.3.

   A protector MAY protect PWs for one or multiple primary PEs.  The
   protector MUST maintain a separate label space for each primary PE.
   Likewise, the PWs of a primary PE MAY be protected by multiple
   protectors, each for a subset of the PWs.  In any case, a given
   primary PW is associated with one and only one pair of {primary PE,
   protector}.

4.2.  Context Identifier

   An IPv4/v6 address is assigned to each ordered pair of {primary PE,
   protector} to facilitate protection establishment.  This address is
   referred to as a "context identifier".  It MUST be globally unique,
   or unique in the address space of the network where the primary PE
   and the protector reside.

4.2.1.  Semantics

   The semantics of a context identifier is twofold.

   o  It identifies a primary PE and an associated protector.  In other
      words, it identifies a primary PE on a per protector basis.  A
      given primary PE may be protected by multiple protectors, each for
      a subset of the primary PWs hosted by the primary PE.  A distinct
      context identifier MUST be assigned to the primary PE and each
      protector.

      For a primary PW, its ingress PE MUST set up a transport tunnel
      with destination as the context identifier of the {primary PE,
      protector}, rather than an IP address of the primary PE.  This
      enables the transport tunnel to follow a path to the primary PE,
      and also indicates the protector to the PLR(s) along the path.

   o  It indicates the primary PE's label space to a protector.  The
      protector may protect primary PWs for multiple primary PEs.  It
      MUST maintain a separate label space for each primary PE, and
      associate the PW labels assigned by the primary PE with the label
      space via the context identifier of the {primary PE, protector}.
      The association is accomplished as below.

      When the primary PE advertises the label of a primary PW to the
      protector, it MUST attach the context identifier to it
      (Section 4.7).  Upon receiving the advertisement, the protector
      MUST install the PW label in the label space corresponding to the
      context identifier.

      A bypass tunnel's destination MUST be set to the context
      identifier as well, rather than an IP address of the protector.
      Therefore, the bypass tunnel (either MPLS tunnel label or IP
      tunnel destination address) can indicate the label space to the
      protector.  All PW packets received on the bypass tunnel MUST be
      forwarded based on a label lookup in that label space.

Internet-Draft     PW Endpoint Fast Failure Protection     February 2013


4.2.2.  Advertisement and Path Computation

   Using a context identifier as destination for both a transport tunnel
   and a bypass tunnels demands that the context identifier be
   advertised by IGP (OSPF or ISIS) in the routing domain and/or the TE
   domain, as an address reachable via both the primary PE and the
   protector.  This imposes the following requirements on path
   computation for these tunnels.

   o  For the transport tunnel, the ingress PE MUST choose the primary
      PE as the actual endpoint.

   o  For the bypass tunnel, the PLR MUST choose the protector as the
      actual endpoint.  The path MUST avoid the primary PE, with the
      exception of an egress AC protection bypass tunnel, where the PLR
      itself is the primary PE.

   The detail of how IGP may advertise a context identifier is
   independent of the protection mechanism, and therefore out of the
   scope of this document.  Some possible approaches are described by
   [LSP-EGRESS-PROTEC].  The ultimate goal is to allow CSPF (constrained
   shortest path first), LFA (loop free alternate; RFC 5286) and MRT
   (maximally redundant trees; [IP-LDP-FRR-MRT]) to compute the expected
   paths for the transport and bypass tunnels.

4.3.  Protection Models

   There are two protection models based on the location and role of a
   protector.  A network MAY use either protection model, or a
   combination of both.

4.3.1.  Co-located Protector

   In this model, the protector is a backup PE that is directly
   connected to the target CE via a backup AC, or it is a backup S-PE on
   a backup PW.  That is, the protector is co-located with the backup
   (S-)PE.  Examples of this model have been introduced in Figure 4,
   Figure 5 and Figure 6 in Section 4.1.

   In egress AC protection and egress PE node protection, when a
   protector receives traffic from the PLR, it forwards the traffic to
   the CE via the backup AC.  This is shown in Figure 7, where PE2 is
   the PLR for egress AC failure, P3 is the PLR for PE2 failure, and PE4
   (the backup PE) is the protector.

   In S-PE node protection, when a protector receives traffic from the
   PLR, it MUST forward the traffic via the next segment of the backup
   PW.  The T-PE of the backup PW MUST forward the traffic to the CE via
   a backup AC.  This is shown in Figure 8, where P4 is the PLR for SPE1
   failure, and SPE2 (the backup S-PE) is the protector for SPE1 (the
   primary S-PE).

   In the co-located protector model, the number of context identifiers
   needed by a network is the number of distinct {primary PE, backup PE}
   pairs.  Therefore, the model is suitable for networks where the
   number of backup PEs for any given primary PE is relatively small.

4.3.2.  Centralized Protector

   In this model, the protector is a dedicated P router or PE router
   that protects PWs for multiple primary PEs.  In egress AC protection
   and egress PE node protection, the protector MAY or MAY NOT be a
   backup PE with a direct connection to the target CE.  In S-PE node
   protection, the protector MAY or MAY NOT be a backup S-PE of the
   backup PW.

   In egress AC protection and egress PE node protection, when the
   protector receives traffic from the PLR, if the protector has a
   direct connection (i.e. backup AC) to the CE, it MUST forward the
   traffic to the CE via the backup AC, which is similar to Figure 7.
   Otherwise, it MUST forward the traffic to a backup PE, which MUST
   then forward the traffic to the CE via a backup AC.  This is shown in
   Figure 9, where the protector receives traffic from P3 or PE2 (the
   PLRs) and forwards the traffic to PE4 (the backup PE).  The protector
   may be protecting other PWs as well, which is not shown in this
   figure.

                                 Figure 10

   In the centralized protector model, each primary PE MAY only need one
   protector to protect all of its PWs.  Therefore, the number of
   context identifiers required by a network can be as low as the number
   of primary PEs.

4.4.  Transport Tunnel

   The ingress PE of a primary PW (or PW segment) associates the PW with
   the primary egress PE through LDP signaling.  The ingress PE MUST
   also associate the transport tunnel with the context identifier of
   the {primary PE, protector}, by establishing the transport tunnel
   with the context identifier as destination (Section 4.2.1).  This not
   only ensures that PW traffic be transported by the tunnel to the
   primary PE, but also facilitates bypass tunnel establishment at
   PLR(s), as the context identifier implies both the primary PE and the
   protector.

   The association between the transport tunnel and the context
   identifier at the ingress PE MAY be achieved by configuration or an
   auto-discovery mechanism.  In the later case, the ingress PE MAY
   learn the context identifier from the primary PE, if the primary PE
   advertises the context identifier as "third party next hop" in an
   IPv4/v6 Interface_ID TLV (RFC 3471, RFC 3472) in the LDP Label
   Mapping message of the primary PW.

Internet-Draft     PW Endpoint Fast Failure Protection     February 2013


4.5.  Bypass Tunnel

   A PLR may protect multiple PWs associated with one or multiple pairs
   of {primary PE, protector}.  The PLR MUST establish a bypass tunnel
   to each protector for each distinct context identifier associated
   with the protector.  The destination of the bypass tunnel MUST be the
   context identifier (Section 4.2.1).  The PLR may learn the context
   identifier from the destination address from the transport tunnel
   that traverses it.

   For examples, in Figure 7 and Figure 9, a bypass tunnel is
   established from PE2 (PLR for egress AC failure) to the protector,
   and another bypass tunnel is established from P3 (PLR for egress node
   failure) to the protector.  In Figure 8 and Figure 10, a bypass
   tunnel is established from P4 (PLR for switching node failure) to the
   protector.

   During local repair, the PLR forwards traffic to the protector
   through the bypass tunnel with PW label intact.  This normally
   involves pushing a label to the label stack, if the bypass tunnel is
   an MPLS tunnel, or pushing an IP header to the packets, if the bypass
   tunnel is an IP tunnel.  The protector MUST in turn forward the
   traffic based on the PW label, i.e. an upstream assigned label.  To
   perform such forwarding, the protector MUST rely on the bypass tunnel
   as a context to determine the primary PE's label space.  If the
   bypass tunnel is an MPLS tunnel, the protector MUST assign a non-
   reserved label for the bypass tunnel, and use this label as the
   context.  If the bypass tunnel is an IP tunnel, the protector can
   decide the context based on the context identifier carried as
   destination address in the IP header.

   A bypass tunnel MUST have the property that it is not affected by the
   topology change caused by the failure that it protects against.
   Therefore, it can be used to transmit traffic during the convergence
   of control plane protocols and the delay of global repair.  It will
   remain effective, until the traffic is moved to another fully
   functional egress AC, PW or transport tunnel.

4.6.  Forwarding State on Protector

   A protector MUST learn PW labels from all the primary PEs that it
   protects (Section 4.7), and maintain the PW labels in a separate
   label space for each primary PE.  In the control plane, a primary
   PE's label space is identified by the context identifier of the
   {primary PE, protector}.  In the forwarding plane, the label space is
   indicated by bypass tunnels that are destined for the context
   identifier.

4.6.1.  Co-located Protector

   In Figure 11, PE4 is a co-located protector that protects PW1 against
   egress AC failure and egress node failure.  It maintains a label
   space for PE2, which is identified by the context identifier of {PE2,
   PE4}.  It learns PW1's label from PE2, and installs an forwarding
   entry for the label in that label space.  The nexthop of the
   forwarding entry indicates a label pop with outgoing interface
   pointing to the backup AC CE2-PE4.

4.6.2.  Centralized Protector

   In the centralized protector model, for each primary PW of which the
   protector is not a backup (S-)PE, the protector MUST also learn the
   label of the backup PW from the backup (S-)PE (Section 4.8).  This is
   the backup (S-)PE that the protector will forward traffic to.  The
   protector MUST install a forwarding entry with label swap from the
   primary PW's label to the backup PW's label.

   In Figure 13, the protector is a centralized protector that protects
   PW1 against egress AC failure and egress node failure.  It maintains
   a label space for PE2, which is identified by the context identifier
   of {PE2, protector}.  It learns PW1's label from PE2, and PW2's label
   from PE4.  It installs a forwarding entry for PW1's label in the
   label space.  The nexthop of the forwarding entry indicates a label
   swap to PW2's label.

4.7.  PW Label Distribution from Primary PE to Protector

   A primary PE SHOULD distribute the label of each primary PW to the
   protector that protects the PW.  To achieve this, the primary PE MUST
   establish a targeted LDP session with the protector.  For each
   primary PW, the primary PE SHOULD advertise over that session a
   Protection FEC Element via Label Mapping message.  The Protection FEC
   Element is a new LDP FEC, and its encoding is described below.  The
   PW's label is encoded in the Upstream-Assigned Label TLV defined in
   (RFC 6389).  The combination of the Protection FEC Element and the PW
   label represent the primary PE's forwarding state for the PW.  The
   Label Mapping message SHOULD also carry an IPv4/v6 Interface_ID TLV
   (RFC 6389, RFC 3471) encoded with the context identifier of the
   {primary PE, protector}.

   The protector that receives this Label Mapping message SHOULD install
   a forwarding entry for the PW label in the label space identified by
   the context identifier.  The nexthop of the forwarding entry SHOULD
   allow packets to be sent towards the target CE via a backup AC or a
   backup (S-)PE, depending on the protection model and SS-PW or MS-PW
   scenario, as described in previous sections.

   The Protection FEC Element has type 0x83.  It is defined as below:

4.8.  PW Label Distribution from Backup PE to Protector

   In the centralized protector model, a protector may not be a backup
   (S-)PE for some primary PWs.  For these PWs, in addition to learning
   PW labels from the primary PEs, the protector SHOULD also learn the
   labels of backup PWs and backup PW segments from backup (S-)PEs.

   To achieve this, each backup (S-)PE MUST establish a targeted LDP
   session with the protector.  The backup PE SHOULD advertise over that
   session a Protection FEC Element for the backup PW via Label Mapping
   message.  The content of this Protection FEC Element MUST match the
   Protection FEC Element that the primary PE advertises to the
   protector (section 4.8).  The Label Mapping message SHOULD also
   include a Generic Label TLV encoded with the backup PW's label.  The
   context identifier SHOULD NOT be encoded in Interface_ID TLV in this
   message.  The combination of the Protection FEC Element and the
   backup PW's label combined represent the backup PE's forwarding state
   for the backup PW.

   The protector that receives this Label Mapping message SHOULD
   associate the backup PW with the primary PW, based on the common
   Protection FEC Element.  It SHOULD distinguish between the message
   from the primary PE and the message from the backup PE based on the
   presence and absence of context identifier in Interface_ID TLV.  It
   SHOULD install a forwarding entry for the primary PW's label in the
   label space identified by the context identifier.  The nexthop of the
   forwarding entry SHOULD indicate a label swap to the backup PW's
   label.

4.9.  Revertive Behavior

   After local repair takes effect at a PLR, there are three strategies
   for restoring traffic to a fully working PW.

   o  Global revertive mode

      If the ingress CE is multi-homed (Figure 1), it MAY switch the
      traffic to a backup AC which is bound to a backup PW.  Or, if the
      ingress PE hosts a backup PW (Figure 2), it MAY switch the traffic
      to the backup PW.  These procedures are referred to as global
      repairs.  Possible triggers of a global repair include PW status,
      OAM, and BFD.

   o  Control plane revertive mode

      In egress PE node protection and S-PE node protection, it is
      possible that the failure is limited to the link between the PLR
      and the primary (S-)PE, while the primary (S-)PE is still up.  In
      this case, if the PLR or an upstream router along the transport
      tunnel can reach the primary (S-)PE via an alternative path, the
      transport tunnel MAY be rerouted around the failed link, so that
      it can continue to carry the PW traffic to the primary (S-)PE.
      This procedure is driven by control plane convergence, and is
      referred to as control plane repair.

   o  Local revertive mode

      The PLR MAY move traffic back to the primary PW, after the failure
      is resolved.  In egress AC protection, upon detecting that the
      primary AC is restored, the PLR MAY start forwarding traffic via
      the AC again.  Likewise, in egress PE node protection and S-PE
      node protection, upon detecting that the primary PE is restored,
      the PLR MAY re-establish the primary transport tunnel through the
      primary PE, and move the traffic back to the tunnel.  These
      procedures are referred to as local reversion.

   The fast protection mechanism in this document SHOULD always be used
   in tandem with the globally revertive mode.  Particularly in the case
   of egress (S-)PE failure, if the ingress PE or the protector loses
   communication with the (S-)PE for an extensive period of time, the
   LDP session between them may go down.  Consequently, the ingress PE
   may bring down the primary PW, or the protector may delete the
   forwarding entry of the primary PW label from the label space.  In
   either case, the service will be disrupted.  In other words, although
   the fast protection can temporarily repair traffic, control plane
   states may eventually time out if the failure persists.  Therefore,
   it is recommended that the global revertive mode SHOULD always be

Internet-Draft     PW Endpoint Fast Failure Protection     February 2013


   established in advance, so that traffic can be moved to a fully
   working backup PW shortly after the local repair.

   The control plane revertive mode may happen as part of the
   convergence of control plane protocols.  However, it is only
   applicable to some specific topologies.

   The local revertive mode is optional.  In the circumstances where the
   failure is caused by resource flapping, local reversion MAY be
   dampened to limit potential disruptions.  Local revertive mode MAY be
   disabled completely by configuration.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry of LDP FECs at the registry "Label
   Distribution Protocol" in the sub-registry called "Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC) Type Name Space".

   This document defines a new LDP Protection FEC Element in
   Section 4.7.  IANA has assigned the type value 0x83 to it.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in RFC 5036, RFC 5331, RFC
