     Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
                 draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling-05.txt

Abstract

   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched
   optical networks (WSON).  Such extensions are necessary in WSONs
   under a number of conditions including: (a) when optional
   processing, such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at
   specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured
   to accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where
   equipment must be configured to output an optical signal with
   specific attributes. In addition this memo provides mechanisms to
   support distributed wavelength assignment with bidirectional LSPs,
   and choice in distributed wavelength assignment algorithms. These
   extensions build on previous work for the control of lambda and
   G.709 based networks.

1. Introduction

   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched
   optical networks (WSON).  Fundamental extensions are given to permit
   simultaneous bi-directional wavelength assignment while more
   advanced extensions are given to support the networks described in
   [RFC6163] which feature connections requiring configuration of
   input, output, and general signal processing capabilities at a node
   along a LSP.

   These extensions build on previous work for the control of lambda
   and G.709 based networks.

   which are employed to transmit/terminate the optical signals for
   data transmission.



3. Requirements for WSON Signaling

   The following requirements for GMPLS based WSON signaling are in
   addition to the functionality already provided by existing GMPLS
   signaling mechanisms.

3.1. WSON Signal Characterization

   WSON signaling MUST convey sufficient information characterizing the
   signal to allow systems along the path to determine compatibility
   and perform any required local configuration. Examples of such
   systems include intermediate nodes (ROADMs, OXCs, Wavelength
   converters, Regenerators, OEO Switches, etc...), links (WDM systems)
   and end systems (detectors, demodulators, etc...). The details of
   any local configuration processes are out of the scope of this
   document.

   From [RFC6163] we have the following list of WSON signal
   characteristic information:

                    List 1. WSON Signal Characteristics




Bernstein et al.       Expires August 18, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions           February 2013


  1. Optical tributary signal class (modulation format).
  2. FEC: whether forward error correction is used in the digital
     stream and what type of error correcting code is used
  3. Center frequency (wavelength)
  4. Bit rate
  5. G-PID: General Protocol Identifier for the information format

   The first three items on this list can change as a WSON signal
   traverses a network with regenerators, OEO switches, or wavelength
   converters. These parameters are summarized in the Optical Interface
   Class as defined in the [WSON-Info] and the assumption is that a
   class always includes signal compatibility information.
   An ability to control wavelength conversion already exists in GMPLS
   signaling along with the ability to share client signal type
   information (G-PID). In addition, bit rate is a standard GMPLS
   signaling traffic parameter. It is referred to as Bandwidth Encoding
   in [RFC3471].

3.2. Per LSP Network Element Processing Configuration

   In addition to configuring a network element (NE) along an LSP to
   input or output a signal with specific attributes, we may need to
   signal the NE to perform specific processing, such as 3R
   regeneration, on the signal at a particular NE.  In [RFC6163] we
   discussed three types of processing not currently covered by GMPLS:

     (A) Regeneration (possibly different types)

     (B) Fault and Performance Monitoring

     (C) Attribute Conversion

   The extensions here MUST provide for the configuration of these
   types of processing at nodes along an LSP.



3.3. Bi-Directional WSON LSPs

   WSON signaling MAY support LSP setup consistent with the wavelength
   continuity constraint for bi-directional connections. The following
   cases MAY be separately supported:




Bernstein et al.       Expires August 18, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions           February 2013


   (a)  Where the same wavelength is used for both upstream and
        downstream directions

   (b)  Where different wavelengths can be used for both upstream and
        downstream directions.

   This document will review current GMPLS bidirectional solutions
   according to WSON case.

3.4. Distributed Wavelength Assignment Selection Method

   WSON signaling MAY support the selection of a specific distributed
   wavelength assignment method.

   This method is beneficial in cases of equipment failure, etc., where
   fast provisioning used in quick recovery is critical to protect
   carriers/users against system loss. This requires efficient
   signaling which supports distributed wavelength assignment, in
   particular when the centralized wavelength assignment capability is
   not available.

   As discussed in the [RFC6163] different computational approaches for
   wavelength assignment are available. One method is the use of
   distributed wavelength assignment. This feature would allow the
   specification of a particular approach when more than one is
   implemented in the systems along the path.

3.5. Out of Scope

   This draft does not address signaling information related to optical
   impairments.

4. WSON Signal Traffic Parameters, Attributes and Processing

   As discussed in [RFC6163] single channel optical signals used in
   WSONs are called "optical tributary signals" and come in a number of
   classes characterized by modulation format and bit rate. Although
   WSONs are fairly transparent to the signals they carry, to ensure
   compatibility amongst various networks devices and end systems it
   can be important to include key lightpath characteristics as traffic
   parameters in signaling [RFC6163].

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions           February 2013


4.1. Traffic Parameters for Optical Tributary Signals

   In [RFC3471] we see that the G-PID (client signal type) and bit rate
   (byte rate) of the signals are defined as parameters and in
   [RFC3473] they are conveyed Generalized Label Request object and the
   RSVP SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC objects respectively.



4.2. Signal Attributes and Processing Capabilities

   The [WSON-Encode] already provides all necessary definitions and
   encoding for WSON information required for signaling. In particular,
   the Resource block information sub-TLV contains, among others, a
   list of available Optical Interface Classes and processing
   capabilities.

   <RBInformation> is defined in Section 5.1 of [WSON-Encode].

     Type        Sub-TLV



   1 (TBA)      <RBInformation>



   One <RBInformation> sub-TLV MUST always be present in the
   WSON_SIGNALING object;otherwise, a PathErr shall be generated. At
   most two <RBInformation> sub-TLVs MAY be present in the
   WSON_SIGNALING object. If more than two objects are encountered, two
   MUST be processed and the rest SHOULD be ignored.



   The <RBInformation> contains several information. The following
   processing rules apply:

   RB Set Field MAY contain more than one RB Indetifier. Only the first
   one MUST be processed, the others SHOULD be ignored.

   The Optical Interface Class List, Input Bit Range List and
   Processing Capability List MAY contain more than one element. Only
   the first MUST be processed, the others SHOULD be ignored.

4.3. Wavelength Assignment Method Selection

   Routing + Distributed wavelength assignment (R+DWA) is one of the
   options defined by the [RFC6163]. The output from the routing
   function will be a path but the wavelength will be selected on a
   hop-by-hop basis.

   Under this hypothesis the node initiating the signaling process
   needs to declare its own wavelength availability (through a
   label_set object). Each intermediate node may delete some labels due
   to connectivity constraints or its own assignment policy. At the
   end, the destination node has to make the final decision on the
   wavelength assignment among the ones received through the signaling
   process.

   As discussed in [HZang00] a number of different wavelength
   assignment algorithms maybe employed. In addition as discussed in
   [RFC6163] the wavelength assignment can be either for a
   unidirectional lightpath or for a bidirectional lightpath
   constrained to use the same lambda in both directions.

   A simple sub-TLV could be used to indication wavelength assignment
   directionality and wavelength assignment method.

      Type               Sub-TLV

       2          <WavelengthSelection>



       0                   1                   2                   3

        different wavelengths

        2 Random, 3 Least-Loaded (multi-fiber).  Others TBD.

   This sub-TLV MAY be present in the WSON_SIGNALING object. If more
   than one sub-TLV is encountered the first one MUST be processed, the
   rest SHOULD be ignored.



4.4. WSON Processing Object Encoding

   Section 3.2. provided the requirements for signaling to indicate to
   a particular NE along an LSP what type of processing to perform on
   an optical signal or how to configure that NE to accept or transmit
   an optical signal with particular attributes.

   To target a specific node, this section defines a WSON_SIGNALING
   object as part of the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and follows procedures
   defined in [RSVP-RO].

   The content of this object is defined in the previous sections 4.2
   and 4.3:

   <WSON_SIGNALING> ::= <RBInformation> [<RBInformation>]
   [<WavelengthSelection>]

   The WSON_SIGNALING object encoding is defined as:

    0                   1                   2                   3

5. Bidirectional Lightpath Setup

   With the wavelength continuity constraint in CI-incapable [RFC3471]
   WSONs, where the nodes in the networks cannot support wavelength
   conversion, the same wavelength on each link along a unidirectional
   lightpath should be reserved. In addition to the wavelength
   continuity constraint, requirement 3.3 gives us another constraint
   on wavelength usage in data plane, in particular, it requires the
   same wavelength to be used in both directions. [RFC6163] in section
   6.1 reports on the implication to GMPLS signaling related to both
   bi-directionality and Distributed Wavelengths Assignment.

   Current GMPLS solution defines a bidirectional LSP (as defined by
   [RFC3471]). The label distribution is based on Label_Set and
   Upstream_Label objects. In case of specific constraints such as the
   same wavelengths in both directions, it may require several
   signaling attempts using information from the Acceptable_Label_Set
   received from path error messages. Since this mechanism is currently
   available and proven to work, no additional extensions are needed
   for WSON. Potential optimizations are left for further studies.

   The usage of <WSON Processing> object for the bidirectional case is
   the same as per unidirectional. When an intermediate node uses
   information from this object to instruct a node about wavelength
   regeneration, the same information applies to both downstream and
   upstream directions.

   Some implementations may prefer using two unidirectional LSPs. This
   solution has been always available as per [RFC3209] however recent
   work introduces the association concept [RFC4872] and [ASSOC-Info].
   Recent transport evolutions [ASSOC-ext] provide a way to associate
   two unidirectional LSPs as a bidirectional LSP. In line with this, a
   small extension can make this approach work for the WSON case.





6. Security Considerations

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models
   within GMPLS and associated protocols. That is the OSPF-TE, RSVP-TE,
   and PCEP security models could be operated unchanged.

   However satisfying the requirements for RWA using the existing
   protocols may significantly affect the loading of those protocols.
   This makes the operation of the network more vulnerable to denial of

   service attacks. Therefore additional care maybe required to ensure
   that the protocols are secure in the WSON environment.

   Furthermore the additional information distributed in order to
   address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of network
   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private.
   Consideration should be given to securing this information.



7. IANA Considerations

   A new LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE type is required
