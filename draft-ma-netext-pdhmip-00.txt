              Prefix Delegation for Hierarchy Mobile IPv6
                     draft-ma-netext-pdhmip-00.txt

Abstract

   This document explains how network mobility and DHCPv6-based Prefix
   Delegation works with hierarchy mobile IPv6.  It is an extension of
   HMIPv6 and allows a mobile network to attach to a MAP via a mobile
   router.  It also makes use of the mechanism of DHCPv6PD to assign
   mobile network prefix (es) to the mobile router which plays the role
   of requesting router.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes protocol extensions to HMIPv6 to enable
   support for network mobility.  The extensions ensure session
   continuity for all the nodes in the mobile network, even as the
   mobile router changes its point of attachment to the MAP.  The
   solution described in the document proposes a bi-directional tunnel
   between the Mobile Router and its Mobile Anchor Point.

   It also uses DHCPv6 prefix delegation to assign mobile network prefix
   (es) to a Mobile Router as specified in DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation for
   NEMO.  The DHCPv6 server running at the MAP is provisioned with
   prefixes to be assigned using any of the prefix assignment mechanisms
   described in the DHCPv6PD specification [RFC3933]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms used in this document are defined in the Mobile
   IPv6 specification [RFC6275]:

   Home Agent (HA)

   Home address (HoA)

   The following terms used in this document are defined in the

   Mobile Network (NEMO)

   Mobile Network Prefix (MNP)

   The following terms used in this documents are defined in the DHCPv6
   [RFC3115] and DHCPv6 prefix delegation [RFC3633]specifications:

   Delegation Router (DR; acts as a DHCPv6 server)

   Requesting Router (RR; acts as a DHCPv6 client)

   DHCPv6 Relay Agent (DRA)

   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6PD)


3.  NEMO protocol for hierarchical mobile networks

   With the network mobility basic support protocol [RFC3963], a mobile
   network can only be accessed via specific gateways called Mobile
   Routers.  The Mobile Router is also the default gateway for the
   Mobile Network.  A Mobile Router has a unique Home Address through
   which it is reachable when it is registered with its Home Agent.

3.1.  Assumption

   In order to use the NEMO protocol for hierarchical mobile networks,
   this specification assumes a mobile network can be accessed via a
   mobile router which is a hmipv6-aware mobile router and should
   receive and process the MAP option and also be able to send local
   binding updates to the MAP.

3.2.  Set Up a tunnel

   The network mobility service of a mobile router is managed by the
   mobile node's policy profile defined in [RFC5380].  The mobile router
   gets a LCoA and a RCoA during the mobile router initial attachment
   procedure.  Then the mobile router sends LBU message to the MAP which
   will then reply a LBA message to the mobile router.  The bi-
   directional tunnel is set up between the mobile router and the MAP.
   The LCoA and RCoA is stored in the binding cache of MAP.


4.  DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation for hierarchy mobile IPv6

   IPv6 Prefix Option for (DHCPv6) [RFC3633] extends the DHCPv6
   [RFC3315] to support a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6
   prefixes.  This mechanism is intended for delegating a long-lived

   prefix from a delegating router to a requesting router.

4.1.  Assumption

   In order to use DHCPv6PD for hierarchical mobile networks, this
   specification also has following assumptions.

   o The MAP assumes the role of the delegating router which is
   configured with a set of prefixes to be used for assignment to
   customers at the time of each customer's first connection to the ISP
   service.

   o The MR assumes the role of the requesting router and the role of a
   DHCPv6 relay agent co-located with the requesting router function.

4.2.  Transmission of DHCPv6 Messages

   The MAP (DR) and the mobile router (RR and DRA) exchange DHCPv6PD
   protocol messages as specified in [RFC3633].

4.3.  Binding association with the delegated prefix

   The MAP (DR) and the mobile router (RR) exchange DHCPv6PD protocol
   messages as specified in [RFC3633].

                   Figure 1: Prefix Delegation in HMIPv6

   The steps of the procedure in Figure 1 are as following.

   1.  The MR sends a local binding update to the MAP in order to
   establish a binding between the RCoA and LCoA.

   2.  MAP replies a local binding acknowledgement to MR, and the HMIPv6
   tunnel is set up between the MR and MAP.

   3.  The mobile router which acts as a "Requesting Router" as
   described in [RFC3633] sends DHCPv6 SOLICIT massage including one or
   more IA_PD option(s) to the MAP to acquire the delegated prefix(es).

   4.  Upon receiving DHCPv6 SOLICIT the MAP inserts one or more IA_PD
   option(s) including the delegated prefix(es) and send it to the MR
   (DHCPv6 relay agent) via the DHCPv6 ADVERTISE message.

   5.  The MR sends DHCPv6 REQUEST message with the IA_PD option(s)
   received from previous message to the MAP (DHCPv6 relay agent).

   6.  The delegating router responses the REQUEST to the MR via DHCPv6
   REPLY message.  The MAP adds an entry in its binding cache including

   the delegated prefixes and LCoA.

4.4.  Mobile Anchor Point Forward

4.4.1.  Intercepting packets sent to the mobile router's mobile network
        prefix

   When the MAP is serving to the mobile router, it MUST be able to
   receive packets those are sent to the mobile router!_s mobile
   network.  In order to receive those packets, the MAP MUST adversative
   a connected router into the Routing Infrastructure for the mobile
   router!_s mobile network.

4.4.2.  Forward packets to the mobile router

   On receiving a packet from a correspondent node with the destination
   address matching the mobile router!_s mobile network prefix (es) the
   MAP MUST forward the packet through the bi-directional tunnel set up
   for that mobile router.

4.5.  Handover

   When the MR moves from the previously AR to a newly AR which is also
   in the domain of the same MAPGBP[not]the MR gets a new LCoA and needs
   to verify that the delegated Prefix (es) is available.  The MR sends
   DHCPv6 Renew message to extend the lifetime of the delegated prefix.
   If the MR finds that the lifetime of the delegated prefix which is
   stored in the IA_PD Prefix Option carried by the DHCPv6 reply
   messages set to zero, the MR should triggers a DHCPv6 SOLICIT to MAP
   to acquire new delegated prefix(es).  The MAP, once the DHCPv6
   signaling has been completed, MUST add an entry in its binding cache
   including the delegated prefix(es) and LCoA.

   When the MR moves from the previously MAP to a newly MAP, MR will
   register with the new MAP, and register its new RCoA with its HA by
   sending a BU that specifies the binding (RCoA, home address), as in
   Mobile IPv6.  In additional, MR should request the delegated
   prefix(es) from the Delegated Router at the MAP.


5.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations from the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
   (HMIPv6) Mobility Management [RFC5380], DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
   specification [RFC3633] apply when using the extensions defined in
   this document

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document reuses the mobile network prefix option defined in [RFC
   3963] in hierarchy mobile IPv6 to assgin the mobile network prefix
   via DHCPv6 for prefix delegation.  It does not introduce any
   additional IANA considerations
