Abstract 


   This document describes how Ethernet Shortest Path Bridging - MAC 
   mode (802.1aq) and (802.1Qbp) can be combined with EVPN in a way that 
   interworks with PBB-MESs as described in the PBB-EVPN solution in a 
   way that permits operational isolation of each Ethernet network 
   subtending an EVPN core while supporting full interworking between 
   the 3 variations of Ethernet operation.

   can be supported by EVPN such that each island is operationally 
   isolated while providing full L2 connectivity between them. Each 
   island can use its own control plane instance and multi-pathing 
   design, be it multiple ECT sets, multiple spanning trees, or ECMP. 

   The intention is to permit both past, current and emerging future 
   versions of Ethernet to be seamlessly integrated to permit large 
   scale, geographically diverse numbers of Ethernet end systems to be 
   fully supported with EVPN as the unifying agent.

3. Solution Overview 

The EPVN solution for 802.1aq SPBM incorporates control plane 
interworking in the MES to map ISIS-SPB [2] information elements into 
the EVPN NLRI information and vice versa. This requires each MES to act 
both as an EVPN BGP speaker and as an ISIS-SPB edge node. Associated 
with this are procedures for configuring the forwarding operations of 
the MES such that an arbitrary number of EVPN subtending SPB islands may 
be interconnected without any topological or multipathing dependencies. 
This requires each MES connected to an SPBM island to act both as an 
EVPN BGP speaker and as an ISIS-SPB edge node. This model also permits 
PBB-MESs as defined in draft-l2vpn-pbb-evpn-02[6] to be seamlessly 
communicate with the SPB islands. The next version of this document will 
add support for 802.1Qbp permitting seamless interworking between 
802.1ah, 802.1aq and 802.1Qbp as well as supporting subtending 802.1ad 
based PBNs.

            Figure 1: PBB and SPBM EVPN Network 
 
Each EVPN is identified by a route target. The route target identifies 
the set of SPB islands and BEB-MESs that are allowed to communicate. 
This manifests itself as a set of Ethernet segments, where each Ethernet 
segment ID is unique within the route target. 
BGP acts as a common repository of the I-SID attachment points for the 
set of subtending MESs/SPBM islands. This is in the form of B-MAC 
address/I-SID/Tx-Rx-attribute tuples. BGP filters leaking I-SID 
information into each SPBM ISLAND on the basis of locally registered 
interest. If an SPBM ISLAND has no BEBs registering interest in an I-
SID, information about that I-SID from other SPBM island, PBB-MESs or 
PBBNs will not be leaked into the local ISIS-SPB routing system. 
Each SPBM island is administered to have an associated Ethernet Segment 
ID (ESI) associated with it.  
For each B-VID in an SPBM island, a single SPBM-MES is elected the 
designated forwarder for the B-VID. An SPBM-MES may be a DF for more 
than one B-VID. This is described further in section 4.2. The SPBM-MES 
originates IS-IS advertisements as if it were an I-BEB or IB-BEB that 
proxy for the other SPBM islands and PBB MESs in the VPN defined by the 
route target, but the MES typically will not actually host any I-
components. 
An SPBM-MES that is a DF for a B-VID strips the B-VID tag information 
from frames relayed towards the EVPN. The DF also inserts the 
appropriate B-VID tag information into frames relayed towards the SPBM 
island on the basis of the local I-SID/B-VID bindings advertised in 
ISIS-SPB. 
                                   
4. Elements of Procedure 

4.1. MES Configuration 

   At SPBM island commissioning a MES is configured with: 

   1) The route target for the service instance. Where a service 
      instance is defined as the set of SPBM islands, PBBNs and PBB-
      MESs to be interconnected by the EVPN. 

   2) The unique ESI for the SPBM island. Mechanisms for deriving a 
      common ESI for the SPBM island are for a future version of the 
      document. 

   And the following is configured as part of commissioning an ISIS-SPB 
   node: 
 
Allan et al.,            Expires January 2013                  [Page 5] 
 
Internet-Draft      draft-allan-l2vpn-spbm-evpn-01            July 2012 
 

   1) A Shortest Path Source ID (SPSourceID) used for algorithmic 
      construction of multicast DA addresses. Note this is  

   2) The set of VLANs (identified by B-VIDs Ethernet frames) used in 
      the SPBM island and multipathing algorithm IDs to use. The B-VID 
      may be different in different domains and may be removed as 
      carried over the IP/MPLS network. 

   A type-1 RD for the node can be auto-derived. This will be described 
   in a future version of the document.  

4.2. DF Election 

   MESs self appoint in the role of DF for a B-VID for a given SPBM 
   island. The procedure used is as per section 9.5.2 of draft-ietf-
   l2vpn-evpn-01[4] "DF election with service carving". 
    
4.3. Control plane interworking ISIS-SPB to EVPN 

   When a MES receives an SPBM service identifier and unicast address 
   sub-TLV as part of an ISIS-SPB MT capability TLV it checks if it is 
   the DF for the B-VID in the sub-TLV. 

   If it is the DF, and there is new or changed information then a MAC 
   advertisement route NLRI is created for each new I-SID in the sub-
   TLV. 

   - the Route Distinguisher (RD) is set to that of the MES 

   - the ESI is that of the SPBM island 

   - the Ethernet tag ID contains the I-SID (including the Tx/Rx 
     attributes). The encoding of I-SID information is as per figure 2.

   - an MPLS label  

   Similarly in the scenario where a MES became elected DF for a B-VID 
   in an operating network, the IS-IS database would be processed in 
   order to construct the NLRI information associated with the new role 
   of the MES. 

   If the BGP database has NLRI information for the I-SID, and this is 
   the first instance of registration of interest in the I-SID from the 
   SPB island, the NLRI information with that tag is processed to 
   construct an updated set of SPBM service identifier and unicast 
   address sub-TLVs to be advertised by the MES. 

   The ISIS-SPB information is also used to keep current a local table 
   indexed by I-SID to indicate the associated B-VID for processing of 
   frames received from EVPN. When an I-SID is associated with more than 
   one B-VID, only one entry is allowed in the table. Rules for this 
   will be in a future version of the document.  

4.4. Control plane interworking EVPN to ISIS-SPB 

   When a MES receives a BGP NLRI that is new information, it checks if 
   the I-SID in the Ethernet Tag ID locally maps to the B-VID it is an 
   elected DF for. Note that if no BEBs in the SPB island have 
   advertised any interest in the I-SID, it will not be associated with 
   any B-VID locally, and therefore not of interest. If the I-SID is of 
   local interest to the SPBM island and the MES is the DF for the B-VID 
   that that I-SID is locally mapped to, a SPBM service identifier and 
   unicast address sub-TLV is constructed/updated for advertisement into 
   IS-IS. 

   The NLRI information advertised into ISIS-SPB is also used to locally 
   populate a forwarding table indexed by B-MAC/I-SID that points to the 
   label stack to impose on the SPBM frame. The bottom label being that 
   offered in the NLRI. 

4.5. Data plane Interworking 802.1aq SPBM island or PBB-MES to EVPN 

   When an MES receives a frame from the SPBM island in a B-VID for 
   which it is a DF, it looks up the B-MAC/I-SID information to 
   determine the label stack to be added to the frame for forwarding in 
   the EVPN. The MES strips the B-VID information from the frame, adds 
   the label information to the frame and forwards the resulting MPLS 
   packet.

Internet-Draft      draft-allan-l2vpn-spbm-evpn-01            July 2012 
 

4.6. Data plane Interworking EVPN to 802.1aq SPBM island 

   When a MES receives a packet from the EVPN it may infer the B-VID to 
   overwrite in the SPBM frame from the I-SID or by other means (such as 
   via the bottom label in the MPLS stack).  

   If the frame has a local multicast DA, it overwrites the SPsourceID 
   in the frame with the local SPsourceID. 

4.7. Data plane interworking EVPN to 802.1ah PBB-MES 

   A PBB-MES actually has no subtending PBBN nor concept of B-VID so no 
   frame processing is required. 

   A PBB-MES is required to accept SPBM encoded multicast DAs as if they 
   were 802.1ah encoded multicast DAs. The only information of interest 
   being that it is a multicast frame, and the I-SID encoded in the 
   lower 24 bits. 

4.8. Dataplane interworking between 802.1Qbp islands and EVPN 

   For a future version of the document 

4.9. Multicast Stitching 

   For a future version of the document 

5. Other Aspects 

5.1. Flow Ordering 

   When per I-SID multicast is implemented via MES replication, a stable 
   network will preserve frame ordering between known unicast and BU 
   traffic (e.g. race conditions will not exist). This cannot be 
   guaranteed when multicast is used in the EVPN. 

5.2. Transit 

   Any MES that does not need to participate in the tandem calculations 
   may use the IS-IS overload bit to exclude SPBM tandem paths and 
   behave as pure interworking platform.
