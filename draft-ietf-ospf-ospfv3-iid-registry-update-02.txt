Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 Instance ID Registry Update      February 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5838] defined the "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values"
   registry for the purpose of mapping OSPFv3 Instance IDs to different
   address families.  The following table lists the value ranges as
   currently allocated.

   +---------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
   | Instance ID Range         | Description       | Assignment Policy |
   +---------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
   | Instance ID # 0 - # 31    | IPv6 unicast AF   | Already Assigned  |
   | Instance ID # 32 - # 63   | IPv6 multicast AF | Already Assigned  |
   | Instance ID # 64 - # 95   | IPv4 unicast AF   | Already Assigned  |
   | Instance ID # 96 - # 127  | IPv4 multicast AF | Already Assigned  |
   | Instance ID # 128 - # 255 | Unassigned        | Standards Action  |
   +---------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

   In some networks additional OSPFv3 instances may be required to
   operationally identify specific applications.


2.  OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values Registry Update

   The IANA "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values" registry must be
   updated as follows:

    +---------------------------+-------------+-----------------------+
    | Instance ID Range         | Description | Assignment Policy     |
    +---------------------------+-------------+-----------------------+
    | Instance ID # 128 - # 191 | Unassigned  | Standards Action      |
    | Instance ID # 192 - # 255 | Reserved    | Private Use [RFC5226] |
    +---------------------------+-------------+-----------------------+


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the modification of the "OSPFv3 Instance ID
   Address Family Values" registry as described in Section 2.  The
   reference to [RFC5838] should be removed from the registry for the
   modified ranges.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document modifies the assignment policy of an IANA registry
   defined in [RFC5838].  It does not introduce any new security issues.
