           Multipath TCP Support for Single-homed End-systems
                     draft-wr-mptcp-single-homed-03

Abstract

   Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at the end-
   systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained by
   different ISPs.  While this scenario is certainly becoming
   increasingly a reality (e.g.  mobile devices), currently most end-
   systems are single-homed (e.g.  desktop PCs in an enterprise).  This
   memo describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to
   multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not available directly at
   the end-systems but somewhere within the network.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF is specifying a multipath TCP (MPTCP) architecture and
   protocol where end-systems operate a modified standard TCP stack
   which allows packets of the same TCP connection to be sent via
   different paths to an MPTCP-capable destination ([I-D.ietf-mptcp-
   multiaddressed], [RFC6182]) where paths are defined by sets of source
   and destination IP addresses.  Using multiple paths has a number of
   benefits such as an increased reliability of the transport connection
   and an effect known as resource pooling [resource_pooling].  Most
   end-systems today do not have multiple paths/interfaces available in
   order to make use of multipath TCP, however further within the
   network multiple paths are the norm rather than the exception.  This
   memo therefore describes ways how these multiple paths in the network
   could potentially made be available to multipath TCP-capable hosts
   that are single-homed.

   In order to illustrate the general mechanism we make use of a simple
   reference scenario shown in Figure 1.

   The scenario in Figure 1 depicts e.g.  a possible SOHO or enterprise
   setup where a gateway/router is connected to two ISPs and a DHCP
   server gives out leases to hosts connected to the local network.
   Note that both, the gateway and the DHCP server could be on the same
   device (similar to current home gateway implementations).

   The host is running a multipath-capable IP stack, however it only has
   a single interface.  The methods described in the following sections
   will let the host make use of the gateway's two interfaces without
   requiring modifications to the MPTCP implementation.

2.  Approaches to Use Multiple Paths in the Network

   All approaches in this document do not require changes to the wire
   format of MPTCP and both communitcating hosts need to be MPTCP-
   capable.  The benefit this approach has is that a) it has no
   implications on how the MPTCP standard progresses, b) it will
   hopefully encourage the deployment of MPTCP as the number of
   scenarios where MPTCP brings benefits vastly expands and c) these
   approaches do not require complex middle-boxes to implement MPTCP-
   like funtionality in the network as other approaches have suggested
   before.

2.1.  Exposing Multiple Paths Through End-host Auto-configuration

   Multipath TCP distinguishes paths by their source and destination IP
   addresses.  Assuming a certain level of path diversity in the
   Internet, using different source and destination IP addresses for a
   given subflow of a multipath TCP connection will, with a certain
   probability, result in different paths taken by packets of different
   subflows.  Even in case subflows share a common bottleneck, the
   proposed multipath congestion control algorithm [RFC6356] will make
   sure that multipath TCP will play nicely with regular TCP flows.

   In order to not require changes to the TCP implementation, we keep
   the above assumptions multipath TCP makes, i.e.  working with
   different IP addresses to use different paths.  Since the end-system
   is single-homed, all IP addresses are bound to the same physical
   interface.  In our reference scenario in Figure 1, the host would
   e.g.  receive more than one RFC1918 [RFC1918] private IP address from
   the DHCP server as depicted in Figure 2.

   The gateway that is shown in Figure 2 has received two IP addresses,
   one from each ISP that it is connected to (ISP1 and ISP2). The NAT
   that the gateway is implementing needs to "map" each private IP
   address of the host consistently to a one of the addresses received
   by the ISPs, i.e.  each private IP to a different public IP. Packets
   sent by the host to the gateway are then routed based on the source
   address found in the packets as illustrated in the figure.  In other
   words, depending on the source address of the host, the packets will
   either go through ISP 1 or ISP 2 and TCP will balance the traffic
   across those two links using its built-in congestion control
   mechanism.

   The way the gateway has received its public IP addresses is not
   relevant.  It could be via via DHCP, IPCP or static configuration.
   In order to configure the host via DHCP, we propose two new DHCP
   options.  The first option "mp-avail" will be sent by single-homed
   multipath TCP-capable clients in the "Parameter Request List".  This
   will show the DHCP server that the client is multipath-capable.  The
   DHCP server will answer with "mp-avail" and the option value is set
   to the number of additional interfaces the gateway can offer to the
   client (in our reference scenario that value would be 1; see Figure
   3).

   Upon receipt of the "mp-avail" option from the server, the client can
   create up to n virtual interfaces, where n is the option value.  Each
   virtual interface will contact the DHCP server and will include the
   "mp-range" option.  The option value will tell the DHCP server that
   the client is requesting an IP out of an IP range that the gateway
   will be forwarding through a different interface.

   The above has been implemented using the ISC DHCP server and client
   version 4.2.1 and the multipath TCP kernel patch 0.5 and a 2.6.36
   Linux kernel.

2.2.  Heuristic Use of Multiple Paths

   The auto-configuration mechanism above has the advantage that
   available paths and information on how to use them are directly sent
   to the end-host.  In other words, there is an explicit singalling of
   the availability of multiple paths to the end-host.  This has the
   advantage that the host can efficiently use these paths.

   This method works well when multiple paths are available close to the
   end-host and means for auto-configuration are available.  But that is
   not always the case.  Another method to use different paths in the
   network without prior knowledge of their existence is to apply
   heuristics in order to exploit setups where Equal Cost Multi-path
   [RFC2991], a widely deployed technology [ECMP_DEPLOYMENT], or similar
   per-flow load-balancing algorithms are employed.

   The ADD_ADDR option defined in [I-D.ietf-mptcp-multiaddressed] can be
   used to advertise the same address but a different port to open
   another subflow.  Additionally, the MP_JOIN option can also be used
   to open another subflow with the same IP address and e.g.  a
   different source port given that a different address ID is used.
   This means there are multiple scenarios possible (e.g.  either
   sender-initated or receiver-initiated) where single-homed end-hosts
   can influence the 5-tuple (source and destination IP addresses and
   port numbers plus protocol number) which is often used as the basis
   for per-flow load balancing (NOTE: in a future version this document
   will describe some of these scenarios in more detail). Changing the
   5-tuple will only with a certain probability result in using a
   different path unless the load-balancing algorithm that is used is
   known to the MPTCP implementation (an assumption we cannot generally
   make). This means that a number of subflows might end up on the same
   path.  Fortunately, the MPTCP congestion control algorithm will make
   sure that the collection of subflows on that path will not be more
   agressive than a single TPC flow.

3.  Other scenarios and extensions

   The reference scenario is only one conceivable setting.  Other
   scenarios such as DSL broadband customers or mobile phones are
   conceivable as well.  As an example, take the DSL scenario.  The home
   gateway could be provided with multiple IP addresses using extensions
   to IPCP. The home gateway in turn can then implement the DHCP server
   and gateway functionality as described before.  More scenarios will
   be described in future versions of this document.

4.  Alternative approaches

   One alternative is that a DHCP server always sends n offers, where n
   is the number of interfaces at the gateway to different ISPs.  The
   client could then accept all or a subset of these offers.  This
   approach seems interesting in environments where there are multiple
   DHCP servers, one for each ISP connection (think multiple
   homegateways). However, accepting multiple offers based on a single
   DHCP request is not standard's compliant behavior.  Also, to cater
   for a scenario that only contains a single DHCP server, server
   changes are needed in any case.  Finally, correct routing is not
   always guaranteed in these scenarios.

   An interesting alternative is the use of ECMP at the gateway for load
   distribution and let MPTCP use different port numbers for subflows.
   Assuming that ECMP is available at the gateway, this approach would
   work fine today.  The only drawback of the approach is that it
   involves a little trial and error to find port numbers that actually
   hash to different paths used by ECMP [RFC2991].
