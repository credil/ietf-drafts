                       IPv6 Email Authentication
                    draft-otis-ipv6-email-authent-00

Abstract

   IPv6 facilitates network routing over an incredibly vast address
   space, but abuse mitigation resolving to underlying structures of
   routes or blocks of prefixes would be highly disruptive due to
   collateral effects.  Use of domains minimizes unintended coincidental
   blocking while offering the consolidation necessary to facilitate
   connection management.  Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring
   SMTP clients can be identified by an authenticated domain.

   DKIM is independent of intended recipients and domains accountable
   for having sent email.  SPF normally requires several text based
   responses imposing high overhead to query various locations.  These
   locations can be constructed by email-address local-part macros which
   can flood caches or leverage DNS name compression to further increase
   network DDoS amplifications when receivers' attempt to verify message
   sources which may then only offer authorization, not authentication
   of accountable domains.  Most email abuse, including what might be
   imposed by SPF, is prevented with comprehensive mapping of the
   address space, but such mapping is impractical with IPv6.

   An effective authenticated domain name alternative is needed to
   provide basis for assessing and reacting to abusive behavior.  For
   most high scale protocols, this involves cryptography.

Internet-Draft             IPv6 EMAIL AUTHENT                   May 2013


1.  Introduction

   There are currently 18,206,379,106,009,090 /64 equivalent IPv6
   [RFC2460] prefixes routed. [v6-BGP-Rpts].  In comparison, for IPv4
   there are 2,614,711,792 IP addresses routed.  While IPv4 is reaching
   its maximum, IPv6 has about 0.09% of the available /64 prefix routed
   and continues to grow rapidly.  Unlike IPv4, there is no practical
   means to scan reverse DNS namespace within IPv6 since each /64 prefix
   may contain any number of PTR records ranging up to
   184,000,000,000,000,000,000.

   A technique commonly employed to automate IPv4 address categorization
   of suitable hosts is to check whether reverse PTR records appear to
   represent valid hostnames.  Those that represent 4 decimal numbers
   are often considered unacceptable, for example.  Our processing of
   reverse DNS namespace in cooperation with network providers now
   exclude about 38%, or about 1,000,000,000 IPv4 addresses.  Comparing
   IPv6 /64 prefixes with the remainder of rout-able IPv4 addresses
   shows there are 11.3 million times more IPv6 /64 prefixes needing
   categorization that also happen to lack a practical means for
   facilitating this effort.

   Management of either a list of names or a list of numbers involves
   logging the associated connections for subsequent review.  Often
   limits are imposed over some period to constrain overall log growth
   when establishing behavior.  When based on currently routed IPv6 /64
   prefixes, storing just a single bit per rout-able prefix requires 6
   million billion bytes or 5,650 Terra-bytes of storage just to track
   simple use.  Storage requirements for simple address use is likely to
   grow another seven fold as more providers adopt IPv6.  Categorization
   of this use will require additional bits to retain counts and indexes
   further multiplying storage needs.

   Some suggest there will not be a significant increase in the number
   of servers running over IPv6 and since the overall number should be
   comparable, email should be dealing with a similar number of IP
   addresses.  Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not constrain the number of IP
   addresses assigned to a network interface.  This feature allows each
   connection from a server to originate from a different IP address
   over the life of its operation while also having an ability to
   effortlessly change /64 prefixes.  The increase may prove explosive.

   Extending IP address reputation to IPv6 would also indicate which
   mailboxes are used to detect abuse and afford malefactors a means to
   wash mailing lists to sidestep enforcement of subscription policies.
   Detection of unsolicited commercial email is a fundamental element in
   email reputation.  Traditional address reputation techniques with
   IPv6 will not retain effective detection.  Even if detection were

   practical, no scheme can distribute highly sparse IP address
   information quickly enough to counter an IPv6 source's agility at
   evading IP address based mitigation.

   Checking reverse DNS entries per SMTP connection requires queries
   against the entire IP address.  For IPv6, reverse DNS checks by SMTP
   servers may inadvertently induce DDoS effects against DNS while also
   consuming the server's connection resources waiting for reverse DNS
   responses.  Prior IPv4 mapping of reverse DNS avoided a sizable waste
   of resources while defending open services.  However, prior mapping
   of reverse DNS is not practical with IPv6 making it impossible to
   defended against DDoS effects or excessive resource loss while
   checking the reverse namespace.

   Alternatively, costs related to blocking port 25 by Customer-Premises
   Equipment should be negligible.  Network providers should offer
   different services to isolate residential from commercial use, in a
   manner analogous to IPv4 reverse PTR records designating dynamic and
   static assignments.  Residential systems sending email to SMTP's
   public port 25, for the most part, represent compromised systems.
   Blocking this category of traffic would be much safer than expecting
   recipients to check the reverse namespace.  Windows, OS X, and iOS
   employ the IPv6 privacy extensions [RFC4941] where any problematic IP
   address is likely to be reassigned different addresses regularly and
   remain valid beyond the reassignment interval.


2.  Maintaining Trust

   Not every subsystem or protocol layer should be expected to repeat
   previous security checks, however critical checks should not be
   assumed, especial those that involve a trivial amount of effort.
   With high levels of abuse resulting from email's open nature,
   delegating checks in a structured manner better conserves essential
   resources.  However, email's highly distributed store and forward
   protocol could not function if rigid message structures were enforced
   by the transport.  New authentication or presentation requirements
   may involve small structural adjustments.  For example,
   internationalization introduced a format negotiation not assured to
   survive beyond the next hop.


3.  Responding to Defects and Exploitation

   With the advent of aviation, the world marveled at the skill and
   intellect taking us to ever greater heights.  With aviation, faults
   threatening security that when found demanded our attention and
   diligence to effect repair.  As with aviation, the success of email

Internet-Draft             IPv6 EMAIL AUTHENT                   May 2013


   has risen to great heights.  Email has became an integral component
   in general commerce and the maintenance of security such as reporting
   system failures, break-in attempts, and facilitating account access
   recovery.

   Reporting or predicting failure should not be viewed as exhibiting a
   lack of respect for achieved accomplishments.  Noting and repairing
   faults only signify the importance of email's prominent role.  As
   with most security related protocols, responding to noted defects is
   fairly common.  Not responding to discovered defects in a security
   related protocol would be shocking.


4.  SMTP Can't

   SMTP [RFC5321] recommends against rejecting messages based upon
   perceived defects in the message structure.  This liberal acceptance
   permits evolutionary changes in message specifications starting at
   [RFC0822] that was based on [RFC0733] replaced by [RFC2822] and again
   by [RFC5322], [RFC6152], [RFC6530], and [RFC6854]; the second to last
   paragraph in section 3 of [RFC5321] provides a definitive statement
   messages should not be rejected due to perceived defects in the
   [RFC0822] message structure.  The initial reference to [RFC0822] in
   this paragraph offers two foot notes with the second referencing the
   latest version of [RFC0822] which is [RFC5322] which itself has
   recently been updated.  The impact of initially removing text
   specifically indicating which header fields are not to repeat is
   unknown.  This information was implied within the then-new ABNF
   notation.  Clarifying text for this requirement did not return until
   the [RFC0822] revision 19 years later which also indicates this
   specification's success at providing a foundation that allowed email
   to flourish.


5.  DKIM Vulnerability

   DKIM permits a vulnerability by not checking the message header field
   stack for invalid repeats when signing or verifying a signature.  The
   DKIM signature process must walk both down and then up the header
   field stack while selecting the header fields to be included in the
   hash process of the signature.  The DKIM process will even ignore
   prefixed From header fields which is the only header field always
   included.

   The WG concluded that the "listing non-existent header fields as
   signed" hack added in non-normative language together with opinions
   that checking for invalid repeated header fields is to be considered
   SMTP's problem.  This issue was expressed as not an attack against



Otis & Rand             Expires November 3, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             IPv6 EMAIL AUTHENT                   May 2013


   the trust DKIM intends to convey, and thus not a concern for DKIM.
   Nevertheless, improperly formed messages may display only the first
   of multiple header fields that, as a result of erroneous assumptions
   of there being no invalid repeated header fields, the prefixed header
   fields are likely to be displayed in lieu of those signed while not
   impacting DKIM's signature validity.

   DKIM incorrectly assumed the header field stack's starting
   conditions, which itself is best able to determine.  This is likely
   to astonish most recipients that DKIM failed to make a robust effort
   to maintain the trust it is attempting to convey.  As such, DKIM
   Signers may sign malformed messages (e.g., violate [RFC5322]).  In
   addition, receivers will verify these messages as having valid
   signatures despite multiple instances of a header field only
   permitted to occur once.  See addendum for examples.

   Use of DKIM on such messages exposes a vulnerability in the
   evaluation process.  Rather ensuring essential checks are made prior
   to producing a result, a wasteful hack was later suggested where
   extra non-existent header fields could be included in the list of
   signed header fields.  Any pre-pended header field added after
   signing would thereby change resulting hashes and invalidate the
   signature.  Not all domains are attempting to achieve the same level
   of trust and may be more sensitive to incurring incremental storage
   requirements.  Some domains may even inadvertently sign invalid
   repeated header fields because this check had not been required in
   DKIM the process.  These same DKIM domains are also likely to
   establish themselves as being Too Big To Block.  These TBTB domains
   can then be used to spoof other domains that may have otherwise
   established a high level of trust by implementing the hack where, due
   to this defect in DKIM, can still do nothing in their defense from
   the perspective of now deceived recipients.

   This vulnerability in DKIM represents an exploit allowing serious
   attacks caused by erroneous assumptions made in DKIM's signature
   process.  There is also a header field, which because of its label,
   may potentially mislead recipients into believing it contains valid
   "Authentication-Results" [RFC5451].  Common phrases such as
   "Authentication-Results", "pass", and "fail", rather than use of
   result codes belies introductory claims this header is not intended
   for direct human consumption.


6.  Barriers to an Authenticated Domain

   Many advocate either SPF or DKIM as a means to obtain domain
   references based on the increased prevalence of these protocols.
   DKIM is independent of the domain actually sending the message and



Otis & Rand             Expires November 3, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             IPv6 EMAIL AUTHENT                   May 2013


   the recipient by design.  Unfortunately, DKIM also does not attempt
   to protect against likely abuses that are also beyond the control of
   the signing domain in which DKIM signature validity conveys no
   assurance pre-fixed header fields have not changed what recipients
   see.  As such, DKIM signing domains can not be held accountable for
   incidents of abuse appearing to violate subscription policies or that
   spoof other domains.


7.  Mail From Parameter and SPF

   Access to outbound SMTP servers may or may not restrict the Mail
   Parameter use.  The strategy used to control abuse might rely upon
   rate limits and denial of access subsequent to abuse reports.
   Reasons for publishing SPF records might be to mitigate backscatter
   based on records that offer Non-Delivery-Notifications (NDNs)
   authorization by the Mail From parameter where the loss of some of
   these notifications is considered acceptable.  This mechanism does
   not offer a positive basis for identification.  Its intent is to
   constrain the number of invalid NDNs being returned when someone
   spoofs their domain.  Evidence of this intent might be denoted by SPF
   record's ending or providers overriding them with "?all".

   SPF failure rates of even a few percent are too high for it to offer
   a solid basis for either acceptance or rejection.  There are some
   policy strategies that attempt to combine SPF and DKIM where when
   either of their related domains manage to pass, only then is the
   message to be placed in the in-box.

   Domains that reference SPF resource records should not be considered
   authenticated because the SPF process authorized the SMTP client.
   Often an SMTP client is shared by many domains.  As such, it would be
   incorrect to assume SPFv1 records that authorize a provider by way of
   the Mail Parameters is only permitted by authenticated accounts from
   that domain.

   As a result, no domain information in SPF or DKIM, under current
   circumstances, can be used as a domain reference for either
   acceptance or reputation.


8.  IPv6 and SPF with PTR or local-part Macros

   When IPv6 becomes more commonly used, some will attempt white-listing
   IP addresses as a practical albeit non-scalable method to deal with
   the highly increased address range that is confronted when dealing
   with IPv6.  There are currently no practical solutions able to scale
   to the challenging range of IP addresses that might be controlled by



Otis & Rand             Expires November 3, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             IPv6 EMAIL AUTHENT                   May 2013


   malefactors.

   Unlike most DNS resources that segregate IPv4 and IPv6 datasets, SPF
   consolidates both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses into a common list
   comprised of a chain of DNS transactions.  SPF also includes macros
   run by recipients that can expand the local-part of the Mail From
   parameter or the IP address of the SMTP client into labels used in
   subsequent DNS queries.  Expressing an IPv6 address using the SPF
   macro in the reverse order nibble form can comprise a query
   containing more than 32 labels.  If local-part macros are used to
   locate 10 MX records, the combined targets for these MX records can
   comprise a set of 100 separate hostnames.  Local-part macros can also
   be used to chain SPF record sets making forensic review difficult.

   The SPF review documented in [RFC6686] failed to provide a breakdown
   on the macro use.  SPF's macros can prove hazardous, especially with
   IPv6.  Rather than permitting the receiver to decide the method used
   for acceptance, an SPF resource record based upon the Mail From
   parameter can induce 100 DNS transactions using labels constructed
   from random strings found in the message local-part.  These
   transactions may also decide to use the reverse namespace to place an
   extreme burden on DNS, its cache, and the SMTP server's connection
   resources.

   The SPF-bis draft purports to be documenting current use.  It dropped
   the SPF resource record (99) due to sparse use.  If a similar
   threshold were applied, the SPF macro expansion aspects of this
   protocol would be removed as well.  Several large providers have
   offered their assurance that their SPF libraries had these macros
   removed.  Any effort hoping to define current use MUST carefully
   reconsider the inclusion of this ill-considered feature.  Otherwise,
   it can not be suggested SPF-bis simply documents current use.

   The danger imposed by the use of the local-part macro is inherent in
   the query required to support both an IPv6 expansion, in conjunction
   with the expansion of local-part macros induced by possibly cached
   SPF records.  The local-part, along with a range of IP addresses made
   readily possible by IPv6, can be manipulated to induce a flurry of
   large DNS transactions directed toward any otherwise uninvolved
   domain, all directed by cached DNS records that contain active
   content.

   It is never a good idea to allow free attacks.  The SPF local-part
   macro would allow a cached DNS record to be repeatedly exploited by a
   spam campaign with an attacker consuming little of their resources
   beyond what they already use in their spam campaign.  In this case,
   their recipients change the domains queried on behalf of the
   attackers based upon the same SPF resource record.  High levels of

Internet-Draft             IPv6 EMAIL AUTHENT                   May 2013


   amplification still apply if SPF specifications are not changed and
   resulting implementation are then assumed part of some greater
   security requirement and no longer experimental.  The SPF macro DOS
   overview demonstrated in 2006 [I-D.otis-spf-dos-exploit] did not
   consider IPv6 use which offers higher gain, where the gain achieved
   sending a single 1KB message to a single recipient offered a 1:156
   reflected gain over IPv4 that can never be filtered or blocked by
   using BCP38 [RFC2827].

   Logically, local-part macros would not safely provide a positive
   result without the query being combined with an IP address list of
   SMTP clients in some form.  A list structure would need to be
   repeated for each of the users.  Rcpt To using schemes like BATV
   provides an expedient way where the purported sender determines
   whether a NDN can be returned without the risk associated with active
   content placed within DNS resource records.  Several parsers ignore
   local-part macro expansion since they rarely play any role in
   providing positive results.


9.  Domains as a Basis for Managing Traffic

   A manageable basis for assessments can leverage a smaller number of
   related domains, compared to IPv6 or even IPv4 addresses.  Although
   technically the domain name space can be larger than the massively
   large IPv6 address space, in practice it is not.  One hundred
   thousand domains control 90% of Internet traffic out of approximately
   100 million domains active each month.  The top 150 domains control
   50% of the traffic, and the top 2,500 domains control 75%.  This
   level of domain consolidation permits effective fast-path white-
   listing.  Improvements achieved using domains to consolidate the
   threat landscape can easily justify added cryptographic
   authentication burdens.  Even APL resource records [RFC3123] can
   authenticate EHLO using a single DNS transaction, but this would not
   allow IPv6 email to be more easily managed, which this technology can
   offer.


10.  XMPP Shows the Way Forward

   In addition to SMTP [RFC5321] using StartTLS [RFC3207] XMPP [RFC6122]
   uses StartTLS [RFC6120] over a different port with many of the
   features used by web servers such as [RFC2560] as one means to
   increase scalability.

   It seems plausible that by defining SMTP access over port 465 is
   where a new authentication and international requirement can be
   resolved together.
