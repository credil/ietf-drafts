INTERNET DRAFT         Control - Init & Bootstrap      February 19, 2013


1  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-murray-triggers-01] specifies mechanisms for CDN
   interconnction control for the "High" and "Medium" priority
   requirements for the CDNI Control Interface identified in section 4
   of [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements].

   This draft concentrates on the remaining "Low" priority requirements
   for the CDNI Control Interface, reproduced here for convenience:

      CNTL-5   [LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow a CDN to
      establish, update and terminate a CDN interconnection with another
      CDN whereby one CDN can act as a Downstream CDN for the other CDN
      (that acts as an Upstream CDN).

      CNTL-6   [LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow control of the
      CDNI interconnection between any two CDNs independently for each
      direction (i.e.  For the direction where CDN1 is the Upstream CDN
      and CDN2 is the Downstream CDN, and for the direction where CDN2
      is the Upstream CDN and CDN1 is the Downstream CDN).

      CNTL-7   [LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow bootstrapping
      of the Request-Routing interface.  For example, this can
      potentially include:

            *   negotiation of the Request-Routing method (e.g.  DNS vs
                HTTP, if more than one method is specified)

            *   discovery of the Request-Routing protocol endpoints

            *   information necessary to establish secure communication
                between the Request-Routing protocol endpoints.

      CNTL-8   [LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow bootstrapping
      of the CDNI Metadata interface.  This information could, for
      example, include:

            *   discovery of the CDNI Metadata signaling protocol
                endpoints

            *   information necessary to establish secure communication
                between the CDNI Metadata signaling protocol endpoints.

      CNTL-9   [LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow bootstrapping
      of the Content Acquisition interface.  This could, for example,
      include exchange and negotiation of the Content Acquisition
      protocols to be used across the CDNs (e.g.  HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, ATIS
      C2).

INTERNET DRAFT         Control - Init & Bootstrap      February 19, 2013


      CNTL-10  [LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow exchange and
      negotiation of delivery authorization mechanisms to be supported
      across the CDNs (e.g.  URI signature based validation).

      CNTL-11  [LOW] The CDNI Control interface may allow bootstrapping
      of the CDNI Logging interface.  This information could, for
      example, include:

      *   discovery of the Logging protocol endpoints

            *   information necessary to establish secure communication
                between the Logging protocol endpoints

            *   negotiation/definition of the log file format and set of
                fields to be exported through the Logging protocol, with
                some granularity (e.g.  On a per content type basis).

            *   negotiation/definition of parameters related to
                transaction Logs export (e.g., export protocol, file
                compression, export frequency, directory).

   This document does not consider those parts of the control interface
   that relate to configuration, bootstrapping or authentication of CDN
   Interconnect interfaces.

   o  Section 2 outlines the model for the Trigger Interface at a high
      level.
   o  Section 3 describes collections of Trigger Resources.
   o  Section 4 defines the RESTful web service provided by dCDN.

   o  Section 5 lists properties of Trigger Requests and Status
      Resources.
   o  Section 6 defines a JSON encoding for Trigger Requests and Status
      Resources.
   o  Section 7 contains example messages.


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Model for CDNI Triggers
   We follow the same model of CDNI triggers defined in section 2 of [I-
   D.ietf-murray-triggers-01] except that we define additional actions
   for CDNI control initiation and bootstrapping to meet the
   requirements described in section 1.

   A trigger, sent between CDNs, is a request for the recipient CDN to
   do some work relating to data from originating CDN.

   The trigger may request actions related with initiation and
   bootstrapping, the following actions can be requested:

   o  initialize - used to instruct a CDN to initialize 
      a CDN interconnection with another CDN at boot time.
   o  add - used to instruct a CDN to add newly created 
      footprint & capabilities(fp_cap) or 
      content and metadata(cdmd). 
   o  update - used to instruct a CDN to update the existing
      fp_cap or cdmd when there are changes.
   o  remove - used to instruct a CDN to remove the existing
      fp_cap or cdmd.
   o  negotiate auth - used to instruct a CDN to negotiate 
      delivery authorization mechanism.

   The CDNI trigger interface is a RESTful web service offered between
   CDNs. It allows creation and deletion of triggers, and tracking of
   the triggered activity.  When recipient CDN accepts a trigger it

INTERNET DRAFT         Control - Init & Bootstrap      February 19, 2013


   creates a resource describing status of the triggered activity, a
   Trigger Status Resource.  The originating CDN may poll Trigger Status
   Resources to monitor progress.

   The recipient CDN maintains a collection of Trigger Status Resources
   for each originating CDN, each originating CDN only has access to its
   own collection and the location of that collection is shared when CDN
   interconnection is established.

   To trigger activity in recipient CDN, originating CDN will POST to
   the collection of Trigger Status Resources.  If recipient CDN accepts
   the trigger, it creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its
   location to originating CDN.  To monitor progress, originating CDN
   may GET the Trigger Status Resource.  To cancel a trigger, or remove
   a trigger from the collection once its activity has been completed,
   originating CDN may DELETE the Trigger Status Resource.

   In addition to the collection of all Trigger Status Resources for
   originating CDN, it shall have access to filtered views of that
   collection. These filtered views are defined in Section 3 and include
   collections of active and completed triggers.  These collections
   provide a mechanism for polling the status of multiple jobs.

   Figure 1 is an example showing the basic message flow used by the
   originating CDN to trigger activity in recipient CDN, and for 
   originating CDN to discover the status of that activity.  Only 
   successful triggering is shown.  
   Examples of the messages are given in Section 7.

              Figure 1: Basic CDNI Message Flow for Triggers

   The steps in Figure 1 are:

   1.  originating CDN triggers action in recipient CDN by posting to 
       a collection of Trigger Status Resources,
       "http://dcdn.example.com/triggers/originating CDN".  
       The URL of this was given to originating CDN when 
       the trigger interface was established.
   2.  recipient CDN authenticates the request, validates 
       the trigger and if it accepts the request, creates a new 
       Trigger Status Resource.
   3.  recipient CDN responds to originating CDN with an HTTP 201 
       response status, and the location of the Trigger Status Resource.
   4.  originating CDN may repeatedly poll the Trigger Status Resource 
       in recipient CDN.
   5.  recipient CDN responds with the Trigger Status Resource, 
       describing progress or results of the triggered activity.

   The remainder of this document describes the messages, Trigger Status
   Resources, and collections of Trigger Status Resources in more
   detail.

2.1.  Timing of Triggered Activity

   Timing of triggered activity is under recipient CDN control,
   including its start-time and pacing of the activity in the network.

   Establish, update and terminate triggers MUST be applied upon the
   trigger was created in recipient CDN.  For other action triggers,
   recipient CDN MAY apply the triggers upon trigger creation.

2.2.  Trigger Results

   Each Trigger Request may operate on multiple data items, and may
   request different actions.  The trigger shall be reported as
   successful only if all actions can be completed successfully.

   If any part of the trigger request fails, the trigger shall be
   reported as failed, and the error property in the Trigger Status
   Resource will be used to enumerate which actions failed and the
   reasons for failure.

   If a recipient CDN is also acting as uCDN in a cascade environment,
   it MUST forward triggers to any downstream CDNs that may have data
   affected by the trigger.  The trigger MUST NOT be reported as
   complete in a CDN until it is complete in all of its downstream CDNs.
    A trigger MAY be reported as failed as soon as it fails in a CDN or

5.4.  Trigger Resource Simple Data Type Descriptions

   This section describes the simpler data types that are used for
   properties of Trigger Status resources.

5.4.1.  TriggerType

   This type defines the type of action being triggered, permitted
   actions are initialize, add, update, and negotiate

5.4.2.  TriggerStatus

   This type describes the current status of a Trigger, possible values
   are:

   o  Pending - the trigger has not yet been acted upon.
   o  Active - the trigger is currently being acted upon.
   o  Complete - the triggered activity completed successfully.
   o  Failed - the triggered activity could not be completed.

5.4.3.  General

   This type describes a set of general information of a CDN, 
   possible values are cdnname, cdnid, and cdnhostname.

5.4.4.  Contract

   This type describes a set of CDN information where interconnection
   contract is established.  It consists of cdnname, cdnid, 
   cdnhostname, ucdnflag, and dcdnflag. xcdnflag indicates 
   whether it is capable of either uCDN or dCDN.

5.4.5. Fp_cap

   This type describes a set of footprint and capabilities information

   needed for bootstrapping.  It consists of cdnname, iprange,
   delay, load, and bandwidth.  Note that some attributes of this type 
   need to be aligned with ones defined in the 
   "draft-spp-cdni-rr-foot-cap-semantics" draft.

5.4.6. Cdmd

   This type describes a set of contents and metadata information
   needed for bootstrapping. It consists of hostindex, hostmetadatas,
   pathmetadatas.  Note that attributes of this type is aligned with 
   ones defined  in "draft-ietf-cdni-metadata" draft.

5.4.7.  AbsoluteTime

   Times are expressed in seconds since the UNIX epoch.

8  Security Considerations

   The recipient CDN must ensure that each originating CDN only has
   access to its own Trigger Status Resources.

   It is anticipated that a common authentication mechanism will be used
   by this and other CDNI Interconnect interfaces, the mechanism must
   exist but is not identified in this document.

   The recipient CDN must ensure that activity triggered by originating
   CDN only affects metadata or content originating from that
   originating CDN.


9  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
