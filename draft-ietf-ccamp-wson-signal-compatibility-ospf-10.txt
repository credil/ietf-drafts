Abstract 

   This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support 
   signal compatibility constraints associated with WSON network 
   elements. These routing enhancements are required in common optical 
   or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the optical 
   signals in the network are compatible with all network elements 
   participating in the network.  

   This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical 
   or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches, 
   regenerators, and wavelength converters since such systems can be 
   limited to processing only certain types of WSON signals.

1. Introduction 

   The documents [RFC6163, WSON-Info, WSON-Encode] explain how to 
   extend the wavelength switched optical network (WSON) control plane 
   to allow both multiple WSON signal types and common hybrid electro 
   optical systems as well hybrid systems containing optical switching 
   and electro-optical resources. In WSON, not all of the optical 
   signals in the network are compatible with all network elements 
   participating in the network. Therefore, signal compatibility is an 
   important constraint in path computation in a WSON.  

   This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support 
   signal compatibility constraints associated with general WSON 
   network elements. These routing enhancements are required in common 
   optical or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the 
   optical signals in the network are compatible with all network 
   elements participating in the network.  

   This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical 
   or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches, 
   regenerators, and wavelength converters since such systems can be 
   limited to processing only certain types of WSON signals. 

   1.1. Revision History 

   From 00 to 01: The details of the encodings for compatibility moved 
   from this document to [WSON-Encode]. 

   From 01 to 02: Editorial changes. 

   From 02 to 03: Add a new Top Level Node TLV, Optical Node Property 
   TLV to carry WSON specific node information.  

   From 03 to 04: Add a new sub-TLV, Block Shared Access Wavelength 
   Availability TLV to be consistent with [WSON-Encode] and editorial 
   changes.

Internet-Draft OSPF Enhancement for WSON Signal Compatibility    August 
2012 
    

   From 04 to 05: Add a new section that discusses OSPF scalability and 
   timeliness and editorial changes. 

   From 05 to 06: Change the title of the draft to "GMPLS OSPF 
   Enhancement" from "OSPF Enhancement" to make sure the changes apply 
   to the GMPLS OSPF rather than the base OSPF. Add specific OSPF 
   procedures on how sub-TLVs are packaged per [RFC3630] and editorial 
   changes.  

   From 06 to 07: Add clarifying texts on how to sub-divide the Optical 
   Node TLV in case it exceeds the IP MTU fragmentation limit. Delete 
   Section 3.2. to avoid multiple rules so as to avoid confusion.  

   From 07 to 08: Clean some old texts in Section 3. Align with [WSON-
   Encode] on the modulation and FEC type.  

   From 08 to 09: Added ISCD extensions for available labels and shared 
   backup labels. 

   From 09 to 10: Revised for OIC changes consistent with encoding 
   document. 

2. The Optical Node Property TLV  

   [RFC3630] defines OSPF TE LSA using an opaque LSA. This document 
   adds a new top level TLV for use in the OSPF TE LSA: the Optical 
   Node Property TLV. The Optical Node property TLV describes a single 
   node. It is constructed of a set of sub-TLVs. There are no ordering 
   requirements for the sub-TLVs. Only one Optical Node TLV shall be 
   advertised in each LSA. 

   The Optical Node Property TLV contains all WSON-specific node 
   properties and signal compatibility constraints. The detailed 
   encodings of these properties are defined in [WSON-Encode].  

   The following sub-TLVs of the Optical Node Property TLV are defined: 

   Value       Length      Sub-TLV Type

   TBA         variable    Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability 
    
   The detail encodings of these sub-TLVs are found in [WSON-Encode] as 
   indicated in the table below.

   All sub-TLVs defined here may occur at most once in any given 
   Optical Node TLV. "At most once" means that if there is sub-TLV 
   related information, it should be always included. These 
   restrictions need not apply to future sub-TLVs. Unrecognized sub-
   TLVs are ignored. 

   2.1. Sub-TLV Details  

   Among the sub-TLVs defined above, the Resource Pool State sub-TLV 
   and Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability are dynamic in 
   nature while the rest are static. As such, they can be separated out 
   from the rest and be advertised with multiple TE LSAs per OSPF 
   router, as described in [RFC3630] and [RFC5250]. Resource Block 
   Information 

   Resource Block Information sub-TLVs are used to convey relatively 
   static information about individual resource blocks including the 
   resource block properties and the number of resources in a block. 

   There are five nested sub-TLVs defined in the Resource Block 
   Information sub-TLV.

   2.1.1. Resource Pool Accessibility 

   This sub-TLV describes the structure of the resource pool in 
   relation to the switching device. In particular it indicates the 
   ability of an ingress port to reach a resource block and of a 
   resource block to reach a particular egress port. 

   2.1.2. Resource Block Wavelength Constraints 

   Resources, such as wavelength converters, etc., may have a limited 
   input or output wavelength ranges. Additionally, due to the 
   structure of the optical system not all wavelengths can necessarily 
   reach or leave all the resources. Resource Block Wavelength 
   Constraints sub-TLV describe these properties.  

   2.1.3. Resource Pool State 

   This sub-TLV describes the usage state of a resource that can be 
   encoded as either a list of 16 bit integer values or a bit map 
   indicating whether a single resource is available or in use. This 
   information can be relatively dynamic, i.e., can change when a 
   connection is established or torn down.  

   2.1.4. Block Shared Access Wavelength Availability 

   Resources blocks may be accessed via a shared fiber. If this is the 
   case then wavelength availability on these shared fibers is needed 
   to understand resource availability.

3. ISCD format extensions 

   The Interface Switching Capability Descriptor describes switching   
   capability of an interface [RFC 4202].  This document defines a new   
   Switching Capability value for WSON as follows: 

      Value                       Type 
      -----                       ---- 
      151 (TBA by IANA)           WSON-LSC capable (WSON-LSC) 
    
   Switching Capability and Encoding values MUST be used as follows: 

           Switching Capability = WSON-LSC 

           Encoding Type = Lambda [as defined in RFC3471] 

   When Switching Capability and Encoding fields are set to values as 
   stated above, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor MUST be 
   interpreted as in RFC4203 with the optional inclusion of one or more 
   Switching Capability Specific Information sub-TLVs. 

   3.1. Switch Capability Specific Information 

   The technology specific part of the WSON ISCD may include a variable 
   number of sub-TLVs called Bandwidth sub-TLVs.  Two types of 
   Bandwidth TLV are defined (TBA by IANA): 

         - Type 1 - Available Labels 

         - Type 2 - Shared Backup Labels 

   The format of the SCSI MUST be as depicted in the following figure:

   are defined in [Gen-Encode]. 

4. WSON Specific Scalability and Timeliness 

   This document has defined five sub-TLVs specific to WSON. The 
   examples given in [WSON-Encode] show that very large systems, in 
   terms of channel count, ports, or resources, can be very efficiently 
   encoded.  

   There has been concern expressed that some possible systems may 
   produce LSAs that exceed the IP Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). In 
   a typical node configuration, the optical node property TLV will not 
   exceed the IP MTU. In a rare case where the TLV exceed the IP MTU, 
   IP fragmentation/reassembly can be used, which is an acceptable 
   method.  

   If the size of this LSA is greater than the MTU, then these sub-TLVs 
   can be packed into separate LSAs. From the point of view of path 
   computation, the presence of the Resource Block Information sub-TLV 
   indicates that resources exist in the system and may have signal 
   compatibility or other constraints. The other four sub-TLVs indicate 
   constraints on access to, and availability of those resources.  

   Hence the "synchronization" procedure from a path computation point 
   of view is quite simple. Until a Resource Block Information sub-TLV 
   is received for a system path cannot make use of the other four sub-
   TLVs since it does not know the nature of the resources, e.g., are 
   the resources wavelength converters, regenerators, or something 
   else. Once this sub-TLV is received path computation can proceed 
   with whatever of the additional types of sub-TLVs it may have 
   received (there use is dependent upon the system type). If path 
   computation proceeds with out of date or missing information from

   these sub-TLVs then there is the possibility of either (a) path 
   computation computing a path that does not exist in the network, (b) 
   path computation failing to find a path through the network that 
   actually exists. Both situations are currently encountered with 
   GMPLS, i.e., out of date information on constraints or resource 
   availability. 

   Note that the connection establishment mechanism (signaling or 
   management) is ultimately responsible for the establishment of the 
   connection, and this implies that such mechanisms must insure signal 
   compatibility. 

    

    
5. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other   
   than those discussed in [RFC3630], [RFC4203]. 

6. IANA Considerations
