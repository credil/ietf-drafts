The Asynchronous Transfer Mode Label Switching Router (ATM-LSR) is one
of the major applications of label switching.  Because the ATM layer
labels (VPI and VCI) associated with a VC rewritten with new value at
every ATM switch nodes, it is not possible to use them to identify a
VC in label mapping messages.  The concept of Virtual Connection
Identifier (VCID) is introduced to solve this problem.  VCID has the
same value at both ends of a VC.  This document specifies the
procedures for the communication of VCID values between neighboring
ATM-LSRs that must occur in order to ensure this property.

This document is a product of the Multiprotocol Label Switching
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
