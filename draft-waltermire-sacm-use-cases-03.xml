    <abstract>
      <t>This document identifies foundational use cases, derived functional capabilities, and requirements needed to provide a foundation for creating interoperable automation tools 
        and continuous monitoring solutions that provide visibility into the state of assets, user activities, and 
        network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security 
        and operational data to understand the organizations security posture, quantify business risk, and make 
        informed decisions that support organizational objectives while protecting critical information.  Organizations
        will be able to use these tools to augment and automate information sharing activities to collaborate with 
        partners to identify and mitigate threats. Other automation tools will be able to integrate with these 
        capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the

    <section title="Key Concepts" anchor="sec-intro-key-concepts">
      <t>The operational methods we use within the bounds of our present realities are failing us - we are falling behind.  We have begun to recognize that the evolution of threat agents, increasing system complexity, rapid situational security change, and scarce resources are detrimental to our success.  There have been efforts to remedy our circumstance, and these efforts are generally known as "Security Automation."</t>
      
      <t>Security Automation is a general term used to reference standards and specifications originally created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and/or the MITRE Corporation.  Security Automation generally includes languages, protocols (prescribed ways by which specification collections are used), enumerations, and metrics.</t>
      
      <t>These specifications have provided an opportunity for tool vendors and enterprises building customized solutions to take the appropriate steps toward enabling Security Automation by defining common information expressions.  In effect, common expression of information enables interoperability between tools (whether customized, commercial, or freely available).  Another important capability common expression provides is the ability to automate portions of security processes to gain efficiency, react to new threats in a timely manner, and free up security personnel to work on more advanced problems within the processes in which they participate.</t>

      <t>The figure above provides some context for our focus area.  Organizations of all sizes will have a more or less formal risk management program, depending upon their maturity and organization-specific needs.  A small business with only a few employees may not have a formally recognized risk management program, but they still lock the doors at night.  Typically, financial entities and governments sit at the other end of the spectrum with often large, laborious risk frameworks.  The point is that all organizations practice, to some degree, Operational Risk Management.  An Information Risk Management program is most likely a constituent of Operational Risk Management (another constituent might be Financial Risk Management).  In the Information Risk Management domain, we often use Control Frameworks to provide guidance for organizations practicing ORM in an information context, and these Control Frameworks define a variety of Controls.</t>
      
      <t>From ORM, IRM, Control Frameworks, and the Controls themselves, organizations derive a set of organization-specific policies, processes, and procedures.  Such policies, processes, and procedures make use of a library of supporting information commonly stipulated by the organization (i.e. enterprise acceptable use policies), but often prescribed by external entities (i.e. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, Sarbanes-Oxley, or EU Data Privacy Directive).  The focus of this document spans Controls, certain aspects of policy, process, and procedure, and Control Frameworks.</t>

            understanding coverage (how many assets are under control) and, 2) understanding specific
            asset details.  Coverage is fairly straightforward - assessing 80% of the enterprise is
            better than assessing 50% of the enterprise.  Getting asset details is comparatively
            subtle - if an enterprise does not have a precise understanding of its assets, then all
            acquired data and consequent actions are considered suspect.  Assessing assets (managed
            and unmanaged) requires that we see and properly characterize our assets at the outset and over time.</t>

            <section title="Concepts">
              <t>What we need to do initially is discover and characterize our assets, and then identify them in a common way.  Characterization may take the form of logical characterization or security characterization, where logical characterization may include business context not otherwise related to security, but which may be used as information in support of decision making later in risk management workflows.</t>
          
            <t>The following list details the requisite Asset Management capabilities:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Discover assets in the enterprise</t>

        <section title="Data Collection" anchor="sec-capabilitiy-data-collection">
          <t>Related to managing assets, and central to any automated assessment solution, is the ability to collect data from (or related to) a target device (some might call this "harvesting").  Of particular interest is data representing the security state of a target, be it a computing device, network hardware, operating system, or application.  The primary interest of the activities demanding data collection is centered on  object state collection, where attributes may be installed software, file properties, operating system and/or application configuration items, and network device configuration items among others.</t>

          <section title="Concepts">
            <!-- TODO: Understand more about what is meant by non-software vulnerabilities -->
            <t>There are many valid perspectives to take when considering required data collection capabilities.  The nature of data collected relating to assets supports a variety of information domains including: security configuration management (SCM) and vulnerability management.  SCM deals with the configuration of computing and infrastructure devices, including the software installed and in use on the device.  Vulnerability management involves identifying the patch level of software installed on the device and the identification of insecure custom code (e.g. web vulnerabilities).  All vulnerabilities need to be addressed as part of a comprehensive risk management program, which is a superset of software vulnerabilities.  Thus, the capability of assessing non-software vulnerabilities applicable to the in-scope system is required.  Additionally, it may be necessary to support non-technical assessment of data relating to assets such as aspects related to operational and management controls.</t>

      <section title="Capabilities Supporting UC2" anchor="uc2-capabilities">
        <t>UC2 is dependent upon UC1 and, therefore, includes all of the capabilities described in Section <xref target="uc1-capabilities"/>.  UC2 describes the ability to make a resource access decision based on an assessment of the requesting system (either by the system itself or on behalf of a user operating that system).  There are two chief capabilities required to meet the needs expressed in Section <xref target="enforcement-of-acceptable-state-uc"/>: Assessment Query and Transport, and Acceptable State Enforcement.</t>
        
        <section title="Assessment Query and Transport" anchor="assessment-transport-capability">
          <t>Under certain circumstances, the system requesting access may be unknown, which can make querying the system problematic (consider a case where a system is connecting to the network and has no assessment software installed). Note that The Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA) protocols (<xref target="RFC5792">PA-TNC</xref>, <xref target="RFC5793">PB-TNC</xref>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-nea-pt-tls">PT-TLS</xref>, and <xref target="I-D.ietf-nea-pt-eap">PT-EAP</xref>) may be used to query and transport the things to be measured.</t>
        </section>
        
        <section title="Acceptable State Enforcement" anchor="state-enforcement-capability">
          <t>Once the assessment has been performed a decision to allow or deny access to the requested resource can be made.  Making this decision is a necessary but insufficient condition for enforcement of acceptable state, and an implementation must have the ability to actively allow or deny access to the requested resource.  For example, network enforcement may be implemented with <xref target="RFC2865">RADIUS</xref> or <xref target="RFC6733">DIAMETER</xref>.</t>

        <t>Recall that UC3 is dependent upon UC1 and therefore includes all of the capabilities described in <xref target="uc1-capabilities"/>.  The difference in UC3 is the notion of when to assess rather than what to assess.  Therefore, the capabilities described in this section are relevant only to the "when" and not to the "what."</t>
        
        <section title="Tasking and Scheduling" anchor="task-schedule-capabilities">
          <t>The ability to task and schedule assessments is requisite for any effective risk management program.  Tasking refers to the ability to create a set of instructions to be conveyed at a later time via scheduling.  Tasking, therefore, involves selecting a set of assessment criteria, assigning that set to a group of assets, and expressing that information in a manner that can be consumed by a collection tool.  Scheduling comes into play when the enterprise determines when to perform a specific assessment task (or set of tasks).  Scheduling may be expressed in a way that constrains tasks to execute only during defined periods, can be ad hoc, or may be triggered by the analysis of previous assessment results or events detected in the enterprise.</t>
          
          <t>The following capabilities support Tasking and Scheduling:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Selection of assessment criteria</t>
              <t>Defining in-scope assets (i.e. targeting)</t>
              <t>Defining periodic assessments for a given set of tasks</t>

        <section title="Data Aggregation and Reporting" anchor="aggregation-reporting-capabilities">
          <t>Assessment results are produced for every asset assessed, and these results must be reported not only individually, but in the aggregate, and in accordance with enterprise needs.  Enterprises should be able to aggregate and report on the data their assessments produce in a number of different ways in order to support different levels of decision making.  At times, security operations personnel may be interested in understanding where the most critical risks exist in their enterprise so as to focus their remediation efforts in the most effective way (in terms of cost and return).  At other times, only aggregated scores will matter, as might be the case when reporting to an information security manager or other executive-level role.</t>
          
          <t>It is not the position of these capabilities to provide explicit details about how reports should be formatted for presentation, but only what information they should contain for a particular purpose.  Furthermore, it is quite easy to imagine the need for a capability providing extensibility to aggregation and reporting.</t>
