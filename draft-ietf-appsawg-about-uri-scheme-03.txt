1. Introduction

   This document specifies the "about" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme, that is currently widely used by Web browsers and some other
   applications to designate access to their internal resources, such as
   settings, application information, so called "Easter eggs" (i.e.
   hidden feature or joke in an application), and so on.

   The concept of "about" URIs has been formed at the times when the
   applications did not have the "friendly" user interface, in order to
   provide an access to the aforementioned resources via typing the URIs
   in the address bar.  Even though the user interface of current
   Internet-targeted software effectively rescinds the issue, and
   "about" URIs can be thought to be a rudimentary phenomenon, they are
   still supported by a variety of Web browsers and are not going to
   cease to exist.

   As use of "about" URIs has been quiet long-lasting, and the URIs have
   been used without any proper registration and absent any proper
   specification, the necessity for the the latter two actions arises. 
   The purpose of this document is to provide a stable specification for
   "about" URI scheme and correspondingly register it in the IANA
   registry.  Along, several provisions for handling the "about" URIs
   are set.

   Please consult RFC 3986 [RFC3986] for definition of generic URIs

INTERNET DRAFT           The "about" URI Scheme            March 4, 2012


   syntax and RFC 4395 [RFC4395] for description of registration process
   for new URI schemes.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. URI Scheme Specification

2.1. URI Scheme Syntax

   The "about" URI MUST syntactically conform to the <about-uri> rule
   below, expressed using Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]:

     about-uri   = "about:" about-token [ about-query ]
     about-token = *pchar     
     about-query = "?" query
     pchar       = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>
     query       = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>

   In terms of RFC 3986, <about-token> part corresponds to <hier-part>,
   and <about-query> to the query component of URI.

2.2. URI Scheme Semantics

   Generally speaking, the resource a particular "about" URI resolves to
   is denoted by <about-token> part of the URI, and <about-query>
   specifies additional information concerning its handling and/or the
   information that should be returned in the resource a URI is resolved
   to.

   However, it is impossible to specify binding between all the possible
   tokens and the semantics of "about" URIs that would contain such
   tokens, which this document does not attempt to do.  Therefore, any
   application resolving an "about" URI MAY choose the resource it is
   resolved to at its own discretion, with the exception of those
   defined below as 'special-purpose "about" URIs'.  They MAY use
   internal redirection to accomplish this (for instance, Opera
   redirects all "about" URIs except "about:blank" to its internal
   "opera" URIs).

2.2.1. Special-Purpose "about" URIs

   A small, though expandable, range of <about-token>s are reserved for
   special purposes ("special-purpose tokens").

INTERNET DRAFT           The "about" URI Scheme            March 4, 2012


   A special-purpose URI is an "about" URI that has a special-purpose
   token as its <about-token> part.  Such URIs MUST be handled in strict
   accordance with the rules defined in the special-purpose token
   registry (see Section 4.2).  The registered entry MAY also define
   additional provisions for handling of the <about-query> part.  If no
   such provisions are defined, the query part has no meaning, and MUST
   be ignored.

   This document defines one special-purpose token: "blank".  The URI
   "about:blank" MUST resolve to a blank page, as seen by the end user. 
   There is no additional handling of the query component in
   "about:blank" URIs.

   Additional special-purpose tokens can be defined by registering an
   registry created in Section 4.2. Special-purpose "about" URIs are
   intended to be uncommon, and new ones should be defined only when
   there is a need to strongly connect a particular <about-token> with a
   particular function in all applications.

2.3. Encoding Considerations

   "about" URIs are subject to encoding rules defined in RFC 3986
   [RFC3986].  "about" IRIs [RFC3987] are not permitted.

3. Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for URIs are discussed in Section 7
   of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  However, many of those provisions hardly
   apply to "about" URI scheme, as they are mainly scoped to schemes
   used in the Internet, not internally.

   "about" URIs may sometimes refer to a sensitive information, such as
   user passwords stored in a cache, or parameter that, if changed, may
   affect user's data.  The application should therefore ensure that
   user's data is in the safety, and no threats are imposed by "about"
   URIs.

4. IANA Considerations

4.1. URI Scheme Registration

   IANA is asked to register the "about" URI scheme in the "URI Schemes"
   registry defined in Section 5.4 of RFC 4395 [RFC4395]:

     URI scheme name: about

     Status: Permanent

4.2. A Registry for Registered Tokens

   IANA is asked to set up a new registry entitled "'about' URI Special
   Purpose Tokens" following the guidelines below.

   The registry entries consist of 3 fields: Special-Purpose Token,
   Description and Reference.  The Special-Purpose Token field MUST
   conform to <about-token> production defined in Section 2.1.  The
   initial registry consists of one entry:

   +------------------+------------------------------------+-----------+
   | Special-Purpose  | Description                        | Reference |
   | Token            |                                    |           |
   +------------------+------------------------------------+-----------+
   | blank            | Used in "about" URIs to refer to   | RFC xxxx  |
   |                  | blank page.                        |           |
   +------------------+------------------------------------+-----------+

   The registration procedures for this registry are "First Come First
   Served", described in RFC 5226 [RFC5226], with supporting
   documentation meeting the requirements below.  The registrant of the
   token MUST provide the following registration template, which will be
   made available on IANA web site:

   o Registered Token:  The desired special-purpose token to be used in
     "about" URIs.

INTERNET DRAFT           The "about" URI Scheme            March 4, 2012


   o Intended usage:  A short description of how "about" URIs with the
     registered token must be handled; especially, what they must be
     resolved to, if resolvable.

   o Handling query component:  It should be mentioned whether there are
     some provisions on handling query components in the "about" URIs
     with the registered token.

   o Contact/Change controller:  An individual or an organization which
     (1) should be contacted for more details, and (2) is authorized to
     change the registration.

   o Specification.  This provides documentation at a level that could
     be used to create a compliant, interoperable implementation of the
     registered "about" URI.  The reference to a full specification MUST
     be provided here, and there should be a reasonable expectation that
     the documentation will remain available.  IANA will consult with
     the IESG or its specified delegate if there is doubt about whether
     the specification is adequate for the purpose.

   The following is a template for "blank" token:

   o Registered Token:  blank
   o Intended usage:  The <about:blank> URI must resolve to a blank
     page.
   o Handling query component:  No special provisions.
   o Contact/Change controller:  IESG <iesg@ietf.org> (on behalf of
     IETF).
   o Specification:  This document.
