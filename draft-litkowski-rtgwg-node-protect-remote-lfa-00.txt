1.  Introduction

   The current RLFA specification described in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] is based on a per link computation (for
   optimization) that prevents determination of guaranteed node
   protection.  This does not mean that the current solution is not able
   to provide node protection for a specific destination, but as
   computation is done from the link perspective, there is no guarantee
   to have node protection.

                B---C

                           Figure 1

   In the figure above, considering all metrics equal, primary path from
   S to D is SED.  S has no LFA to reach D.

   Using RLFA specification, C is a PQ from E perspective and could be
   used as a remote LFA in case of SE failure.  In the diagram above, C
   is a considered as a link protecting alternate (as from E
   perspective, it is only link protecting), even if from a topological
   point of view, C would be a node protecting RLFA.

   There could be multiple reasons to ensure node protection in a
   network :

   o  Presence of nodes with no high availability mechanism.

   o  Avoiding transient loops in case of node crash.

   This draft describes a solution to compute a guaranteed node
   protection using remote LFA solution.

2.2.  Current RLFA behavior

   The current remote LFA computation is based on computation of
   extended P-Space and Q-Space and then intersect both to determine PQ
   nodes that would be used for traffic tunneling.  As Q-Space requires
   rSPF computation (one per Q-Space), it would not be scalable to
   compute Q-Space for each prefix.  RLFA specification is proposing to
   compute Q Space on a per link basis, PQ will so be used by all
   prefixes using the link as primary nexthop.

   Using figure 2 and considering protection of prefixes using E as
   primary nexthop on S, there would be three nodes in PQ space :
   P1,P2,P3.  Using shortest path to PQ as tie breaker, P3 would be the
   best PQ.

   P3 is only providing link protection to D1, D2 and D3 while P1 was
   providing node protection for D1 and D2, and P2 was providing node
   protection for D3.

   In this scenario, RLFA is providing a suboptimal protection because
   of the approximation of using remote end of the link for computation.

2.3.  Guaranteed node protection computation

   To compute a guaranteed node protection using remote LFA, we just
   introduce a small modification in the current algorithm.  Rather than
   computing link protecting PQs from nexthop perspective, we propose to
   compute node protecting PQs from nextnexthop perspective.

   Our proposal is working as follows :

   o  Compute node protecting PQ space for each nextnexthop.

   o  Compute link protecting PQ space for each nexthop (as already
      done).

   o  Prefixes are inheriting protection type from nexthop or
      nextnexthop based on defined policies.  Choosing a PQ in node
      protecting space provides guaranteed node protection.

2.3.1.  Computing node protecting extended P-Space

   We define the notion of node protecting extended P-Space of a node S
   for a connected node E as the union of :

   o  Node protecting P-Space : the set of routers reachable from S
      without traversing node E.

   o  The set of destinations using E as primary nexthop but having a
      node protecting LFA.

2.3.2.  Computing node protecting Q-Space

   The set of routers from which a node N can be reached, by normal
   forwarding, without traversing the node E is termed the node
   protecting Q-space of N with respect to the node E. The Q-space can
   be obtained by computing a reverse shortest path tree (rSPT) rooted
   at N, with the sub-tree which traverses the failed node excised
   (including those which are members of an ECMP).

2.3.3.  Computing node protecting PQ-Spaces

   Upon termination of regular SPT, node S has knowledge of nexthops and
   nextnexthops to reach every destinations.  For each nextnexthop on
   the SPT, S will compute :

   o  Node protecting extended P-Space considering nexthop will fail.

   o  Node protecting extended Q-Space from nextnexthop considering
      nexthop will fail.

   Intersection of both will result in node protecting PQ-Spaces and
   node S will have a node protecting PQ-Space for each nextnexthop.

   In figure 2, considering link SE, S has two nextnexthops (R1 and R2).
   S will compute node protecting PQ Space for R1 and for R2.

   Node protecting extended P-Space :

   o  For R1 : P1,N1

   o  For R2 : P2,N2

   Node protecting Q-Space :

   o  For R1 : P1,D1,D2

   o  For R2 : P2,D3,D2

   Node protecting PQ-Space :

   o  For R1 : P1

   o  For R2 : P2

   As a result, P1 is able to provide node protection for all
   destinations using R1 as nextnexthop (D1,D2).  P2 is able to provide
   node protection for all destinations using R2 as nextnexthop (D3).


3.  Scaling

   Approximation introduced in remote LFA specification was done to
   optimize computation.  Our proposal is introducing more computation
   but in a very acceptable degree.  Computation time will be dependent
   on number of nextnexthops rather than nexthops.

                      Table 1: Number of nextnexthop

   The simulation results above (from real SP topologies) show that the
   number of rSPF to compute is really acceptable : SPF takes today only
   few msec to compute even on large topologies.  Moreover installing
   protection is not an urgent task, and it would be better to take more
