Internet-Draft           SM2 and SM3 for DNSSEC           September 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is a globally distributed, scalable and
   hierarchical database that provides a consistent name space for
   referring to resources.  The DNS has been extended to use hash
   functions and digital signatures to provide origin authentication and
   integrity protection for its data.  RFC 4033 [RFC4033], RFC 4034
   [RFC4034], and RFC 4035 [RFC4035] describe these DNS Security
   Extensions which consist of a set of new resource record types and
   modifications to the existing DNS protocol ([RFC1035]).

   RFC 4034 describes the wire format of DNSKEY, RRSIG and DS resource
   records, and specifies a list of cryptographic algorithms to use.
   This document extends that list with the signature algorithm SM2
   [SM2] and hash algorithm SM3 [SM3], and specifies how to store DNSKEY
   data and how to generate RRSIG and DS resource records with these
   cryptographic algorithms.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  DNSKEY Resource Records

   The format of the DNSKEY resource record can be found in RFC 4034
   [RFC4034].

   SM2 [SM2] public keys are stored with the algorithm number 249 (which
   is a proposed value with pending approval of IANA).  According to
   [SM2], a public key is a point on the elliptic curve Q = (x,y) where
   x and y are the x-coordinate and y-coordinate value, respectively.

   The wire representation of a public key MUST contain 64 octets, where
   the first 32 octets contain the x and the second 32 octets contain
   the y.

2.1.  SM2 DNSKEY RR Example

   In SM2 [SM2], the size of private key is 32 bytes.  Set a private key
   to the following value which is presented in the form of base64
   encoding:

     Algorithm: 249 (SM2)
     SM2 Private Key: EosvqL1DPGwGjI2APf95eSpRmlUXGxtlDCNmHRWJcmM=

Internet-Draft           SM2 and SM3 for DNSSEC           September 2012


   Using the corresponding public key of above private key, the
   following DNSKEY RR stores a DNS public key for example.net:

     example.net. 86400 IN DNSKEY 256 3  249  (1VSMeCXLtWFQo1Bs1XRkr4
     oa4FGd+vPFgiHcgQyvKN2SEHN2j+PVnOVOeaSURc9z/tIwhlNwJyZNFolG1HlTPg==)


3.  RRSIG Resource Records

   The value of the signature field in the RRSIG RR follows SM2 [SM2]
   and is calculated as follows.  The values for the RDATA fields that
   precede the signature data are specified in RFC 4034 [RFC4034].

     hash = SM3(data)

   where "data" is the wire format data of the resource record set that
   is signed, as specified in RFC 4034 [RFC4034].

   Hash MUST be calculated according to SM3 [SM3] and hash size is 256
   bits; Signature is calculated from the hash according to SM2 [SM2]
   and signature size is 512 bits.

3.1.  RRSIG RR Example

   With the private key from section 2.1, sign the following RRSet,
   consisting of one A record:

     host.example.com. 86400  IN  A  192.253.253.1

   Setting the inception date to 2012-09-12 00:00:00 UTC and the
   expiration date to 2012-10-12 00:00:00 UTC, the following signature
   should be valid:

   host.example.com. 86400 IN RRSIG A 249 3 86400 20121012000000
   (20120912000000 2642 example.com.  EeZjSD4pbx6e5wxsxFLSaIwgT1oZP5Qriy
   c6qC8Qo2GSXGJorSrfEjB1y7q65qTJRbym5eZTWdQKoOYmC2Go4w==)


4.  DS Resource Records

   SM3 [SM3] digest algorithm is denoted in DS RRs by the digest type 12
   (which is a proposed value with pending approval of IANA) before a
   specific one is assigned by IANA.  The digest MUST always be
   calculated with parameters defined in [SM3].

4.1.  DS RR Example

   For key signing key

   dskey.example.com. 86400 IN DNSKEY 256 3 249
   (1VSMeCXLtWFQo1Bs1XRkr4oa4FGd+ vPFgiHcgQyvKN2SEHN2j+PVnOVOeaSURc9z/
   tIwhlNwJyZNFolG1HlTPg==) ; key id = 60485

   The DS RR will be

   dskey.example.com. 86400 IN DS 60485 249 12
   (76D4267B639C43BC3EC837266FE4913D86A4C9CB2BC98EC55128CD32F64C5EBA)


5.  Deployment Considerations

5.1.  Key Sizes

   According to SM2 [SM2], the size of SM2 public key is 512 bits.

5.2.  Signature Sizes

   According to SM2 [SM2], the size of a SM2 signature is 512 bits.

5.3.  Digest Sizes

   According to the SM3 [SM3], the size of a SM3 digest is 256 bits.


6.  Implementation Considerations

6.1.  Support for SM2 signatures

   DNSSEC aware implementations MAY be able to support RRSIG and DNSKEY
   resource records created with the SM2 algorithms as defined in this
   document.

6.2.  Support for NSEC3 Denial of Existence

   Any DNSSEC-SM2 implementation MUST support both NSEC [RFC4035] and
   NSEC3 [RFC5155].

6.3.  Byte order

   According to SM3 [SM3], the endianness of SM3 is big-endian.

7.  IANA consideration

   This document updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System Security
   (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers".  The following two entries are added to
   the registry:

     Number  249(proposed)
     Algorithm  SM2
     Mnemonic  ECC-SM2
     Zone Signing  Y
     Trans. Sec.  *
     Reference  this document
     Status  optional

   This document updates the IANA registry for digest types in DS
   records, currently called "Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record
   (RR) Type Digest Algorithms".  The following entries are added:

     Value  12(proposed)
     Digest Type  SM3
     Status  OPTIONAL

   * There has been no determination of standardization of the use of
   this algorithm with Transaction Security.


8.  Security considerations

   This document gives more algorithm choices to the algorithm list in
   RFC 4034 and does not bring in extra risk in protocol aspect.

   In the aspect of algorithm strength, the proposed signature algorithm
   is ECC based with key size of 256 bits.  Theoretically, the strength
   of that algorithm is on the same level as RSA based signature of 2048
   bits.  And there are no known successful attacks since the algorithm
   is published till this document is published.
