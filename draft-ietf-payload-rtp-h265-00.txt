Abstract

   This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding
   standard  ITU-T  Recommendation  H.265  and  ISO/IEC  International
   Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding
   (HEVC) [HEVC], developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video
   Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of
   one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet
   payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP
   packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC stream
   over a single as well as multiple RTP flows.  The payload format has
   wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming,
   and high bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


1. Introduction

1.1. Overview of the HEVC Codec

   High  Efficiency  Video  Coding  [HEVC],  formally  known  as  ITU-T
   Recommendation H.265 and ISO/IEC International Standard 23008-2 was
   ratified by ITU-T in April 2013 and reportedly provides significant
   coding efficiency gains over H.264 [H.264].

   As both H.264 [H.264] and its RTP payload format [RFC6184] are
   widely deployed and generally known in the relevant implementer
   communities,  frequently  only  the  differences  between  those  two
   specifications are highlighted in non-normative, explanatory parts
   of this memo.  Basic familiarity with both specifications is assumed
   for those parts.  However, the normative parts of this memo do not
   require study of H.264 or its RTP payload format.

   H.264  and  HEVC  share  a  similar  hybrid  video  codec  design.
   Conceptually, both technologies include a video coding layer (VCL),
   which is often used to refer to the coding-tool features, and a
   network abstraction layer (NAL), which is often used to refer to the
   systems and transport interface aspects of the codecs.

1.1.1 Coding-Tool Features

   Similarly to earlier hybrid-video-coding-based standards, including
   H.264, the following basic video coding design is employed by HEVC.
   A prediction signal is first formed either by intra or motion
   compensated prediction, and the residual (the difference between the
   original and the prediction) is then coded.  The gains in coding
   efficiency are achieved by redesigning and improving almost all
   parts of the codec over earlier designs.  In addition, HEVC includes
   several tools to make the implementation on parallel architectures
   easier.  Below is a summary of HEVC coding-tool features.

   Quad-tree block and transform structure

   One of the major tools that contribute significantly to the coding
   efficiency of HEVC is the usage of flexible coding blocks and
   transforms, which are defined in a hierarchical quad-tree manner.
   Unlike H.264, where the basic coding block is a macroblock of fixed



Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   size 16x16, HEVC defines a Coding Tree Unit (CTU) of a maximum size
   of 64x64.  Each CTU can be divided into smaller units in a
   hierarchical quad-tree manner and can represent smaller blocks down
   to size 4x4.  Similarly, the transforms used in HEVC can have
   different sizes, starting from 4x4 and going up to 32x32.  Utilizing
   large blocks and transforms contribute to the major gain of HEVC,
   especially at high resolutions.

   Entropy coding

   HEVC uses a single entropy coding engine, which is based on Context
   Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC), whereas H.264 uses two
   distinct  entropy  coding  engines.    CABAC  in  HEVC  shares  many
   similarities with CABAC of H.264, but contains several improvements.
   Those  include  improvements  in  coding  efficiency  and  lowered
   implementation complexity, especially for parallel architectures.

   In-loop filtering

   H.264 includes an in-loop adaptive deblocking filter, where the
   blocking artifacts around the transform edges in the reconstructed
   picture are smoothed to improve the picture quality and compression
   efficiency.  In HEVC, a similar deblocking filter is employed but
   with somewhat lower complexity.  In addition, pictures undergo a
   subsequent filtering operation called Sample Adaptive Offset (SAO),
   which is a new design element in HEVC.  SAO basically adds a pixel-
   level offset in an adaptive manner and usually acts as a de-ringing
   filter.  It is observed that SAO improves the picture quality,
   especially around sharp edges contributing substantially to visual
   quality improvements of HEVC.

   Motion prediction and coding

   There have been a number of improvements in this area that are
   summarized as follows.  The first category is motion merge and
   advanced  motion  vector  prediction  (AMVP)  modes.    The  motion
   information of a prediction block can be inferred from the spatially
   or temporally neighboring blocks.  This is similar to the DIRECT
   mode in H.264 but includes new aspects to incorporate the flexible
   quad-tree   structure   and   methods   to   improve   the   parallel
   implementations.  In addition, the motion vector predictor can be


Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   signaled for improved efficiency.  The second category is high-
   precision  interpolation.    The  interpolation  filter  length  is
   increased to 8-tap from 6-tap, which improves the coding efficiency
   but  also  comes  with  increased  complexity.    In  addition,  the
   interpolation filter is defined with higher precision without any
   intermediate  rounding  operations  to  further  improve  the  coding
   efficiency.

   Intra prediction and intra coding

   Compared to 8 intra prediction modes in H.264, HEVC supports angular
   intra prediction with 33 directions.  This increased flexibility
   improves both objective coding efficiency and visual quality as the
   edges can be better predicted and ringing artifacts around the edges
   can be reduced.  In addition, the reference samples are adaptively
   smoothed based on the prediction direction.  To avoid contouring
   artifacts a new interpolative prediction generation is included to
   improve the visual quality.  Furthermore, discrete sine transform
   (DST) is utilized instead of traditional discrete cosine transform
   (DCT) for 4x4 intra transform blocks.

   Other coding-tool features

   HEVC includes some tools for lossless coding and efficient screen
   content coding, such as skipping the transform for certain blocks.
   These tools are particularly useful for example when streaming the
   user-interface of a mobile device to a large display.

1.1.2 Systems and Transport Interfaces

   HEVC inherited the basic systems and transport interfaces designs,
   such as the NAL-unit-based syntax structure, the hierarchical syntax
   and data unit structure from sequence-level parameter sets, multi-
   picture-level or picture-level parameter sets, slice-level header
   parameters,  lower-level  parameters,  the  supplemental  enhancement
   information  (SEI)  message  mechanism,  the  hypothetical  reference
   decoder (HRD) based video buffering model, and so on.  In the
   following, a list of differences in these aspects compared to H.264
   is summarized.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   Video parameter set

   A new type of parameter set, called video parameter set (VPS), was
   introduced.  For the first (2013) version of [HEVC], the video
   parameter set NAL unit is required to be available prior to its
   activation, while the information contained in the video parameter
   set is not necessary for operation of the decoding process.  For
   future HEVC extensions, such as the 3D or scalable extensions, the
   video parameter set is expected to include information necessary for
   operation of the decoding process, e.g. decoding dependency or
   information for reference picture set construction of enhancement
   layers.  The VPS provides a "big picture" of a bitstream, including
   what types of operation points are provided, the profile, tier, and
   level of the operation points, and some other high-level properties
   of  the  bitstream  that  can  be  used  as  the  basis  for  session
   negotiation and content selection, etc. (see section 7.1).

   Profile, tier and level

   The profile, tier and level syntax structure that can be included in
   both VPS and sequence parameter set (SPS) includes 12 bytes data to
   describe the entire bitstream (including all temporally scalable
   layers,  which  are  referred  to  as  sub-layers  in  the  HEVC
   specification), and can optionally include more profile, tier and
   level  information  pertaining  to  individual  temporally  scalable
   layers.  The profile indicator indicates the "best viewed as"
   profile when the bitstream conforms to multiple profiles, similar to
   the major brand concept in the ISO base media file format (ISOBMFF)
   [ISOBMFF] and file formats derived based on ISOBMFF, such as the
   3GPP  file  format  [3GP].    The  profile,  tier  and  level  syntax
   structure also includes the indications of whether the bitstream is
   free of frame-packed content, whether the bitstream is free of
   interlaced source content and free of field pictures, i.e., contains
   only frame pictures of progressive source, such that clients/players
   with no support of post-processing functionalities for handling of
   frame-packed or interlaced source content or field pictures can
   reject those bitstreams.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   Bitstream and elementary stream

   HEVC includes a definition of an elementary stream, which is new
   compared to H.264.  An elementary stream consists of a sequence of
   one or more bitstreams.  An elementary stream that consists of two
   or more bitstreams has typically been formed by splicing together
   two or more bitstreams (or parts thereof).  When an elementary
   stream contains more than one bitstream, the last NAL unit of the
   last access unit of a bitstream (except the last bitstream in the
   elementary stream) must contain an end of bitstream NAL unit and the
   first access unit of the subsequent bitstream must be an intra
   random access point (IRAP) access unit.  This IRAP access unit may
   be a clean random access (CRA), broken link access (BLA), or
   instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) access unit.

   Random access support

   HEVC includes signaling in NAL unit header, through NAL unit types,
   of IRAP pictures beyond IDR pictures.  Three types of IRAP pictures,
   namely IDR, CRA and BLA pictures are supported, wherein IDR pictures
   are conventionally referred to as closed group-of-pictures (closed-
   GOP) random access points, and CRA and BLA pictures are those
   conventionally referred to as open-GOP random access points.  BLA
   pictures usually originate from splicing of two bitstreams or part
   thereof at a CRA picture, e.g. during stream switching.  To enable
   better systems usage of IRAP pictures, altogether six different NAL
   units are defined to signal the properties of the IRAP pictures,
   which can be used to better match the stream access point (SAP)
   types as defined in the ISOBMFF [ISOBMFF], which are utilized for
   random access support in both 3GP-DASH [3GPDASH] and MPEG DASH
   [MPEGDASH].  Pictures following an IRAP picture in decoding order
   and preceding the IRAP picture in output order are referred to as
   leading pictures associated with the IRAP picture.  There are two
   types of leading pictures, namely random access decodable leading
   (RADL) pictures and random access skipped leading (RASL) pictures.
   RADL  pictures  are  decodable  when  the  decoding  started  at  the
   associated IRAP picture, and RASL pictures are not decodable when
   the decoding started at the associated IRAP picture and are usually
   discarded.  HEVC provides mechanisms to enable the specification of
   conformance of bitstreams with RASL pictures being discarded, thus



Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   to provide a standard-compliant way to enable systems components to
   discard RASL pictures when needed.

   Temporal scalability support

   HEVC  includes  an  improved  support  of  temporal  scalability,  by
   inclusion of the signaling of TemporalId in the NAL unit header, the
   restriction that pictures of a particular temporal sub-layer cannot
   be used for inter prediction reference by pictures of a higher
   temporal sub-layer, the sub-bitstream extraction process, and the
   requirement  that  each  sub-bitstream  extraction  output  be  a
   conforming bitstream.  Media-aware network elements (MANEs) can
   utilize the TemporalId in the NAL unit header for stream adaptation
   purposes based on temporal scalability.

   Temporal sub-layer switching support

   HEVC specifies, through NAL unit types present in the NAL unit
   header,  the  signaling  of  temporal  sub-layer  access  (TSA)  and
   stepwise temporal sub-layer access (STSA).  A TSA picture and
   pictures following the TSA picture in decoding order do not use
   pictures prior to the TSA picture in decoding order with TemporalId
   greater  than  or  equal  to  that  of  the  TSA  picture  for  inter
   prediction reference.  A TSA picture enables up-switching, at the
   TSA picture, to the sub-layer containing the TSA picture or any
   higher sub-layer, from the immediately lower sub-layer.  An STSA
   picture does not use pictures with the same TemporalId as the STSA
   picture for inter prediction reference. Pictures following an STSA
   picture in decoding order with the same TemporalId as the STSA
   picture do not use pictures prior to the STSA picture in decoding
   order with the same TemporalId as the STSA picture for inter
   prediction reference.  An STSA picture enables up-switching, at the
   STSA picture, to the sub-layer containing the STSA picture, from the
   immediately lower sub-layer.

   Sub-layer reference or non-reference pictures

   The concept and signaling of reference/non-reference pictures in
   HEVC are different from H.264.  In H.264, if a picture may be used
   by any other picture for inter prediction reference, it is a
   reference picture; otherwise it is a non-reference picture, and this


Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   is signaled by two bits in the NAL unit header.  In HEVC, a picture
   is called a reference picture only when it is marked as "used for
   reference".  In addition, the concept of sub-layer reference picture
   was introduced.  If a picture may be used by another other picture
   with the same TemporalId for inter prediction reference, it is a
   sub-layer  reference  picture;  otherwise  it  is  a  sub-layer  non-
   reference picture.  Whether a picture is a sub-layer reference
   picture or sub-layer non-reference picture is signaled through NAL
   unit type values.

   Extensibility

   Besides the TemporalId in the NAL unit header, HEVC also includes
   the signaling of a six-bit layer ID in the NAL unit header, which
   must  be  equal  to  0  for  a  single-layer  bitstream.    Extension
   mechanisms have been included in VPS, SPS, PPS, SEI NAL unit, slice
   headers, and so on.  All these extension mechanisms enable future
   extensions in a backward compatible manner, such that bitstreams
   encoded according to potential future HEVC extensions can be fed to
   then-legacy decoders (e.g. HEVC version 1 decoders) and the then-
   legacy decoders can decode and output the base layer bitstream.

   Bitstream extraction

   HEVC includes a bitstream extraction process as an integral part of
   the overall decoding process, as well as specification of the use of
   the  bitstream  extraction  process  in  description  of  bitstream
   conformance tests as part of the hypothetical reference decoder
   (HRD) specification.

   Reference picture management

   The  reference  picture  management  of  HEVC,  including  reference
   picture marking and removal from the decoded picture buffer (DPB) as
   well as reference picture list construction (RPLC), differs from
   that of H.264.  Instead of the sliding window plus adaptive memory
   management control operation (MMCO) based reference picture marking
   mechanism in H.264, HEVC specifies a reference picture set (RPS)
   based reference picture management and marking mechanism, and the
   RPLC is consequently based on the RPS mechanism.  A reference
   picture set consists of a set of reference pictures associated with


Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   a picture, consisting of all reference pictures that are prior to
   the associated picture in decoding order, that may be used for inter
   prediction of the associated picture or any picture following the
   associated picture in decoding order.  The reference picture set
   consists of five lists of reference pictures; RefPicSetStCurrBefore,
   RefPicSetStCurrAfter,    RefPicSetStFoll,    RefPicSetLtCurr    and
   RefPicSetLtFoll.    RefPicSetStCurrBefore,  RefPicSetStCurrAfter  and
   RefPicSetLtCurr contains all reference pictures that may be used in
   inter prediction of the current picture and that may be used in
   inter prediction of one or more of the pictures following the
   current   picture   in   decoding   order.      RefPicSetStFoll   and
   RefPicSetLtFoll consists of all reference pictures that are not used
   in inter prediction of the current picture but may be used in inter
   prediction of one or more of the pictures following the current
   picture in decoding order.  RPS provides an "intra-coded" signaling
   of the DPB status, instead of an "inter-coded" signaling, mainly for
   improved error resilience.  The RPLC process in HEVC is based on the
   RPS, by signaling an index to an RPS subset for each reference
   index.  The RPLC process has been simplified compared to that in
   H.264, by removal of the reference picture list modification (also
   referred to as reference picture list reordering) process.

   Ultra low delay support

   HEVC specifies a sub-picture-level HRD operation, for support of the
   so-called ultra-low delay.  The mechanism specifies a standard-
   compliant way to enable delay reduction below one picture interval.
   Sub-picture-level coded picture buffer (CPB) and DPB parameters may
   be signaled, and utilization of these information for the derivation
   of CPB timing (wherein the CPB removal time corresponds to decoding
   time) and DPB output timing (display time) is specified.  Decoders
   are allowed to operate the HRD at the conventional access-unit-
   level, even when the sub-picture-level HRD parameters are present.

   New SEI messages

   HEVC inherits many H.264 SEI messages with changes in syntax and/or
   semantics making them applicable to HEVC.  The active parameter sets
   SEI message includes the IDs of the active video parameter set and
   the active sequence parameter set and can be used to activate VPSs
   and SPSs.  In addition, the SEI message includes the following

   is supported (when supported, all parameter sets needed for decoding
   of the remaining of the bitstream when random accessing from the
   beginning  of  the  current  coded  video  sequence  by  completely
   discarding all access units earlier in decoding order are present in
   the remaining bitstream and all coded pictures in the remaining
   bitstream can be correctly decoded); 2) An indication of whether
   there is no parameter set within the current coded video sequence
   that updates another parameter set of the same type preceding in
   decoding order.  An update of a parameter set refers to the use of
   the same parameter set ID but with some other parameters changed.
   If this property is true for all coded video sequences in the
   bitstream, then all parameter sets can be sent out-of-band before
   session start.  The region refresh information SEI message can be
   used together with the recovery point SEI message (present in both
   H.264 and HEVC) for improved support of gradual decoding refresh
   (GDR).  This supports random access from inter-coded pictures,
   wherein complete pictures can be correctly decoded or recovered
   after an indicated number of pictures in output/display order.

1.1.3 Parallel Processing Support

   The reportedly significantly higher computational demand of HEVC
   over H.264 (especially with respect to encoders, where a complexity
   increase of a factor of ten has often been reported), in conjunction
   with  the  ever  increasing  video  resolution  (both  spatially  and
   temporally) required by the market, led to the adoption of VCL
   coding tools specifically targeted to allow for parallelization on
   the sub-picture level.  That is, parallelization occurs, at the
   minimum, at the granularity of an integer number of CTUs.  The
   targets for this type of high-level parallelization are multicore
   CPUs and DSPs as well as multiprocessor systems.  In a system
   design, to be useful, these tools require signaling support, which
   is provided in Section 7 of this memo.  This section provides a
   brief overview of the tools available in [HEVC].

   Many of the tools incorporated in HEVC were designed keeping in mind
   the potential parallel implementations in multi-core/multi-processor
   architectures.    Specifically,  for  parallelization,  four  picture
   partition strategies are available.

   Slices are segments of the bitstream that can be reconstructed
   independently from other slices within the same picture (though
   there  may  still  be  interdependencies  through  loop  filtering
   operations).  Slices are the only tool that can be used for
   parallelization that is also available, in virtually identical form,
   in H.264.  Slices based parallelization does not require much inter-
   processor or inter-core communication (except for inter-processor or
   inter-core data sharing for motion compensation when decoding a
   predictively coded picture, which is typically much heavier than
   inter-processor  or  inter-core  data  sharing  due  to  in-picture
   prediction), as slices are designed to be independently decodable.
   However,  for  the  same  reason,  slices  can  require  some  coding
   overhead.  Further, slices (in contrast to some of the other tools
   mentioned below) also serve as the key mechanism for bitstream
   partitioning to match Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) size requirements,
   due to the in-picture independence of slices and the fact that each
   regular slice is encapsulated in its own NAL unit.  In many cases,
   the goal of parallelization and the goal of MTU size matching can
   place contradicting demands to the slice layout in a picture.  The
   realization of this situation led to the development of the more
   advanced tools mentioned below.  This payload format does not
   contain  any  specific  mechanisms  aiding  parallelization  through
   slices.

   Dependent slice segments allow for fragmentation of a coded slice
   into fragments at CTU boundaries without breaking any in-picture
   prediction mechanism.  They are complementary to the fragmentation
   mechanism described in this memo in that they need the cooperation
   of the encoder.  As a dependent slice segment necessarily contains
   an integer number of CTUs, a decoder using multiple cores operating
   on CTUs can process a dependent slice segment without communicating
   parts  of  the  slice  segment's  bitstream  to  other  cores.
   Fragmentation, as specified in this memo, in contrast, does not
   guarantee that a fragment contains an integer number of CTUs.

   In wavefront parallel processing (WPP), the picture is partitioned
   into rows of CTUs.  Entropy decoding and prediction are allowed to
   use data from CTUs in other partitions.  Parallel processing is
   possible through parallel decoding of CTU rows, where the start of
   the decoding of a row is delayed by two CTUs, so to ensure that data
   related to a CTU above and to the right of the subject CTU is


Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   available before the subject CTU is being decoded.  Using this
   staggered start (which appears like a wavefront when represented
   graphically),  parallelization  is  possible  with  up  to  as  many
   processors/cores as the picture contains CTU rows.

   Because in-picture prediction between neighboring CTU rows within a
   picture   is   allowed,   the   required   inter-processor/inter-core
   communication to enable in-picture prediction can be substantial.
   The WPP partitioning does not result in the creation of more NAL
   units compared to when it is not applied, thus WPP cannot be used
   for MTU size matching, though slices can be used in combination for
   that purpose.

   Tiles define horizontal and vertical boundaries that partition a
   picture into tile columns and rows.  The scan order of CTUs is
   changed to be local within a tile (in the order of a CTU raster scan
   of a tile), before decoding the top-left CTU of the next tile in the
   order of tile raster scan of a picture.  Similar to slices, tiles
   break in-picture prediction dependencies (including entropy decoding
   dependencies).  However, they do not need to be included into
   individual NAL units (same as WPP in this regard), hence tiles
   cannot be used for MTU size matching, though slices can be used in
   combination for that purpose.  Each tile can be processed by one
   processor/core,  and  the  inter-processor/inter-core  communication
   required for in-picture prediction between processing units decoding
   neighboring tiles is limited to conveying the shared slice header in
   cases a slice is spanning more than one tile, and loop filtering
   related sharing of reconstructed samples and metadata.  Insofar,
   tiles are less demanding in terms of inter-processor communication
   bandwidth compared to WPP due to the in-picture independence between
   two neighboring partitions.

1.1.4 NAL Unit Header

   HEVC maintains the NAL unit concept of H.264 with modifications.
   HEVC uses a two-byte NAL unit header, as shown in Figure 1.  The
   payload of a NAL unit refers to the NAL unit excluding the NAL unit
   header.

              Figure 1 The structure of HEVC NAL unit header

   The semantics of the fields in the NAL unit header are as specified
   in [HEVC] and described briefly below for convenience.  In addition
   to the name and size of each field, the corresponding syntax element
   name in [HEVC] is also provided.

   F: 1 bit
      forbidden_zero_bit.  MUST be zero.  HEVC declares a value of 1 as
      a syntax violation.  Note that the inclusion of this bit in the
      NAL unit header is to enable transport of HEVC video over MPEG-2
      transport systems (avoidance of start code emulations) [MPEG2S].

   Type: 6 bits
      nal_unit_type.  This field specifies the NAL unit type as defined
      in Table 7-1 of [HEVC].  For a reference of all currently defined
      NAL unit types and their semantics, please refer to Section 7.4.1
      in [HEVC].

   LayerId: 6 bits
      nuh_layer_id.  MUST be equal to zero.  It is anticipated that in
      future  scalable  or  3D  video  coding  extensions  of  this
      specification, this syntax element will be used to identify
      additional  layers  that  may  be  present  in  the  coded  video
      sequence, wherein a layer may be, e.g. a spatial scalable layer,
      a quality scalable layer, a texture view, or a depth view.

   TID: 3 bits
      nuh_temporal_id_plus1.    This  field  specifies  the  temporal
      identifier of the NAL unit plus 1.  The value of TemporalId is
      equal to TID minus 1.  A TID value of 0 is illegal to ensure that
      there is at least one bit in the NAL unit header equal to 1, so

      to enable independent considerations of start code emulations in
      the NAL unit header and in the NAL unit payload data.

1.2. Overview of the Payload Format

   This payload format defines the following processes required for
   transport of HEVC coded data over RTP [RFC3550]:

   o Usage of RTP header with this payload format

   o Packetization of HEVC coded NAL units into RTP packets using three
     types of payload structures, namely single NAL unit packet,
     aggregation packet, and fragment unit

   o Transmission of HEVC NAL units of the same bitstream within a
     single RTP session or multiple RTP sessions

   o Media type parameters to be used with the Session Description
     Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]

2. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the notion of setting and clearing a bit
   when bit fields are handled.  Setting a bit is the same as assigning
   that bit the value of 1 (On).  Clearing a bit is the same as
   assigning that bit the value of 0 (Off).

   middlebox or application layer gateway that is capable of parsing
   certain aspects of the RTP payload headers or the RTP payload and
   reacting to their contents.

      Informative note: The concept of a MANE goes beyond normal
      routers or gateways in that a MANE has to be aware of the
      signaling (e.g., to learn about the payload type mappings of the
      media streams), and in that it has to be trusted when working

      with SRTP.  The advantage of using MANEs is that they allow
      packets to be dropped according to the needs of the media coding.
      For example, if a MANE has to drop packets due to congestion on a
      certain link, it can identify and remove those packets whose
      elimination  produces  the  least  adverse  effect  on  the  user
      experience.  After dropping packets, MANEs must rewrite RTCP
      packets  to  match  the  changes  to  the  RTP  packet  stream  as
      specified in Section 7 of [RFC3550].

   unit would be transported in its own RTP packet.

   RTP  packet  stream:  A  sequence  of  RTP  packets  with  increasing
   sequence  numbers  (except  for  wrap-around),  identical  PT  and
   identical SSRC (Synchronization Source), carried in one RTP session.
   Within the scope of this memo, one RTP packet stream is utilized to
   transport one or more temporal sub-layers.

   transmission order: The order of packets in ascending RTP sequence
   number order (in modulo arithmetic).  Within an aggregation packet,
   the NAL unit transmission order is the same as the order of
   appearance of NAL units in the packet.

   base session: an RTP session in Multi-Session Transmission mode that
   transports a bitstream subset which the rest of RTP sessions in the
   Multi-Session Transmission depends on. [Ed. (YK): Check the need of
   this definition after the draft is more complete.]

   The RTP header information to be set according to this RTP payload
   format is set as follows:

   Marker bit (M): 1 bit

      Set for the last packet of the access unit indicated by the RTP
      timestamp, in line with the normal use of the M bit in video
      formats, to allow an efficient playout buffer handling.  Decoders
      can use this bit as an early indication of the last packet of an
      access unit.

   Payload type (PT): 7 bits

      The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format
      is outside the scope of this document and will not be specified
      here.  The assignment of a payload type has to be performed
      either through the profile used or in a dynamic way.

   Sequence number (SN): 16 bits

      Set and used in accordance with RFC 3550.

   Timestamp: 32 bits

      The RTP timestamp is set to the sampling timestamp of the
      content. A 90 kHz clock rate MUST be used.

      If the NAL unit has no timing properties of its own (e.g.,
      parameter set and SEI NAL units), the RTP timestamp is set to the
      RTP timestamp of the coded picture of the access unit in which
      the NAL unit is included, according to Section 7.4.2.4.4 of
      [HEVC].

      Receivers SHOULD ignore the picture output timing information in
      any picture timing SEI messages or decoding unit information SEI
      messages as specified in [HEVC].  Instead, receivers SHOULD use
      the RTP timestamp for the display process.  Receivers MUST pass
      picture timing SEI messages and decoding unit information SEI
      messages to the decoder and MAY use the field/frame related
      information for the display process e.g. when frame doubling or
      frame  tripling  is  indicated  by  the  field/frame  related
      information.

4.2 Payload Header Usage

   The TID value indicates (among other things) the relative importance
   of an RTP packet, for example because NAL units belonging to higher
   temporal sub-layers are not used for the decoding of lower temporal
   sub-layers.  A lower value of TID indicates a higher importance.
   More  important  NAL  units  MAY  be  better  protected  against
   transmission losses than less important NAL units.

4.3 Payload Structures

   The first two bytes of the payload of an RTP packet are referred to
   as the payload header.  The payload header consists of the same
   fields (F, Type, LayerId, and TID) as the NAL unit header as shown
   in section 1.1.4, irrespective of the type of the payload structure.

   Three  different  types  of  RTP  packet  payload  structures  are
   specified.  A receiver can identify the type of an RTP packet
   payload through the Type field in the payload header.

   The three different payload structures are as follows:

   o  Single NAL unit packet: Contains a single NAL unit in the
      payload, and the NAL unit header of the NAL unit also serves as
      the payload header.  This payload structure is specified in
      section 4.6.

   o  Aggregation packet (AP): Contains more than one NAL unit within
      one access unit.  This payload structure is specified in section
      4.6.

   o  Fragmentation unit (FU): Contains a subset of a single NAL unit.
      This payload structure is specified in section 4.7.

4.4 Transmission Modes

   This memo enables transmission of an HEVC bitstream over a single
   RTP session or multiple RTP sessions.  The concept and working
   principle is inherited from [RFC6190] and follows a similar design.
   If only one RTP session is used for transmission of the HEVC
   bitstream, the transmission mode is referred to as single-session
   transmission (SST); otherwise (more than one RTP session is used for
   transmission  of  the  HEVC  bitstream),  the  transmission  mode  is
   referred to as multi-session transmission (MST).

   [Ed. (YK): Unify the style of abbreviated words throughout the
   document.]

   SST SHOULD be used for point-to-point unicast scenarios, while MST
   SHOULD be used for point-to-multipoint multicast scenarios where



Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   different receivers require different operation points of the same
   HEVC bitstream, to improve bandwidth utilizing efficiency.

      Informative note: A multicast may degrade to a unicast after all
      but one receivers have left (this is a justification of the first
      "SHOULD" instead of "MUST"), and there might be scenarios where
      MST is desirable but not possible e.g. when IP multicast is not
      deployed in certain network (this is a justification of the
      second "SHOULD" instead of "MUST").

   The transmission mode is indicated by the tx-mode media parameter
   (see section 7.1).  If tx-mode is equal to "SST", SST MUST be used.
   Otherwise (tx-mode is equal to "MST"), MST MUST be used.

4.5 Decoding Order Number

   For each NAL unit, the variable AbsDon is derived, representing the
   decoding order number that is indicative of the NAL unit decoding
   order.

   Let NAL unit n be the n-th NAL unit in transmission order within an
   RTP session.

   If tx-mode is equal to "SST" and sprop-depack-buf-nalus is equal
   to 0, AbsDon[n], the value of AbsDon for NAL unit n, is derived as
   equal to n.

   Otherwise (tx-mode is equal to "MST" or sprop-depack-buf-nalus is
   greater than 0), AbsDon[n] is derived as follows, where DON[n] is
   the value of the variable DON for NAL unit n:

   o  If n is equal to 0 (i.e. NAL unit n is the very first NAL unit in
      transmission order), AbsDon[0] is set equal to DON[0].

   o  Otherwise (n is greater than 0), the following applies for
      derivation of AbsDon[n]:

            If DON[n] == DON[n-1],
                AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1]

            If (DON[n] > DON[n-1] and DON[n] - DON[n-1] < 32768),
                AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] + DON[n] - DON[n-1]


Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


            If (DON[n] < DON[n-1] and DON[n-1] - DON[n] >= 32768),
                AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] + 65536 - DON[n-1] + DON[n]

            If (DON[n] > DON[n-1] and DON[n] - DON[n-1] >= 32768),
                AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] - (DON[n-1] + 65536 - DON[n])

            If (DON[n] < DON[n-1] and DON[n-1] - DON[n] < 32768),
                AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] - (DON[n-1] - DON[n])

   For any two NAL units m and n, the following applies:

   o  AbsDon[n]  greater  than  AbsDon[m]  indicates  that  NAL  unit  n
      follows NAL unit m in NAL unit decoding order.

   o  When AbsDon[n] is equal to AbsDon[m], the NAL unit decoding order
      of the two NAL units can be in either order.

   o  AbsDon[n] less than AbsDon[m] indicates that NAL unit n precedes
      NAL unit m in decoding order.

   When two consecutive NAL units in the NAL unit decoding order have
   different values of AbsDon, the value of AbsDon for the second NAL
   unit in decoding order MUST be greater than the value of AbsDon for
   the first NAL unit, and the absolute difference between the two
   AbsDon values MAY be greater than or equal to 1.

      Informative note: There are multiple reasons to allow for the
      absolute difference of the values of AbsDon for two consecutive
      NAL units in the NAL unit decoding order to be greater than one.
      An  increment  by  one  is  not  required,  as  at  the  time  of
      associating values of AbsDon to NAL units, it may not be known
      whether all NAL units are to be delivered to the receiver.  For
      example, a gateway may not forward coded slice NAL units of
      higher sub-layers or some SEI NAL units when there is congestion
      in the network.  In another example, the first intra picture of a
      pre-encoded clip is transmitted in advance to ensure that it is
      readily available in the receiver, and when transmitting the
      first intra picture, the originator does not exactly know how
      many NAL units will be encoded before the first intra picture of
      the pre-encoded clip follows in decoding order.  Thus, the values
      of AbsDon for the NAL units of the first intra picture of the

      pre-encoded clip have to be estimated when they are transmitted,
      and gaps in values of AbsDon may occur.  Another example is MST
      where the AbsDon values must indicate cross-layer decoding order
      for NAL units conveyed in all the RTP sessions.

4.6 Single NAL Unit Packets

   A single NAL unit packet contains exactly one NAL unit, and consists
   of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr), an optional 16-bit DONL
   field (in network byte order), and the NAL unit payload data (the
   NAL unit excluding its NAL unit header) of the contained NAL unit,
   as shown in Figure 3.

   The payload header SHOULD be an exact copy of the NAL unit header of
   the contained NAL unit.  However, the Type (i.e. nal_unit_type)
   field MAY be changed, e.g. when it is desirable to handle a CRA
   picture to be a BLA picture [JCTVC-J0107].

   The DONL field, when present, specifies the value of the 16 least
   significant bits of the decoding order number of the contained NAL
   unit.

   If tx-mode is equal to "MST" or sprop-depack-buf-nalus is greater
   than 0, the DONL field MUST be present, and the variable DON for the
   contained NAL unit is derived as equal to the value of the DONL
   field.  Otherwise (tx-mode is equal to "SST" and sprop-depack-buf-
   nalus is equal to 0), the DONL field MUST NOT be present.

4.7 Aggregation Packets (APs)

   Aggregation packets (APs) are introduced to enable the reduction of
   packetization overhead for small NAL units, such as most of the non-
   VCL NAL units, which are often only a few octets in size.

   An AP aggregates NAL units within one access unit.  Each NAL unit to
   be carried in an AP is encapsulated in an aggregation unit.  NAL
   units aggregated in one AP are in NAL unit decoding order.

   An AP consists of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr) followed
   by one or more aggregation units, as shown in Figure 4.

              Figure 4 The structure of an aggregation packet

   The fields in the payload header are set as follows.  The F bit MUST
   be equal to 0 if the F bit of each aggregated NAL unit is equal to
   zero; otherwise, it MUST be equal to 1.  The Type field MUST be
   equal to 48.  The value of LayerId MUST be equal to the lowest value
   of LayerId of all the aggregated NAL units.  The value of TID MUST
   be the lowest value of TID of all the aggregated NAL units.

      Informative Note: All VCL NAL units in an AP have the same TID
      value since they belong to the same access unit.  However, an AP
      may contain non-VCL NAL units for which the TID value in the NAL
      unit header may be different than the TID value of the VCL NAL
      units in the same AP.

   An AP MUST carry at least two aggregation units and can carry as
   many aggregation units as necessary; however, the total amount of
   data in an AP obviously MUST fit into an IP packet, and the size
   SHOULD be chosen so that the resulting IP packet is smaller than the
   MTU size so to avoid IP layer fragmentation.  An AP MUST NOT contain
   Fragmentation Units (FUs) specified in section 4.7.  APs MUST NOT be
   nested; i.e., an AP MUST NOT contain another AP.

   The first aggregation unit in an AP consists of an optional 16-bit
   DONL field (in network byte order) followed by a 16-bit unsigned
   size information (in network byte order) that indicates the size of
   the NAL unit in bytes (excluding these two octets, but including the
   NAL unit header), followed by the NAL unit itself, including its NAL
   unit header, as shown in Figure 5.

   When present, the DOND field plus 1 specifies the difference between
   the decoding order number values of the current aggregated NAL unit
   and the preceding aggregated NAL unit in the same AP.

   than 0, the DOND field MUST be present in an aggregation unit that

4.8 Fragmentation Units (FUs)

   Fragmentation units (FUs) are introduced to enable fragmenting a
   single  NAL  unit  into  multiple  RTP  packets,  possibly  without
   cooperation or knowledge of the HEVC encoder.  A fragment of a NAL
   unit consists of an integer number of consecutive octets of that NAL
   unit.  Fragments of the same NAL unit MUST be sent in consecutive
   order with ascending RTP sequence numbers (with no other RTP packets
   within the same RTP packet stream being sent between the first and
   last fragment).

   When a NAL unit is fragmented and conveyed within FUs, it is
   referred to as a fragmented NAL unit.  APs MUST NOT be fragmented.
   FUs MUST NOT be nested; i.e., an FU MUST NOT contain a subset of
   another FU.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   The RTP timestamp of an RTP packet carrying an FU is set to the
   NALU-time of the fragmented NAL unit.

   An FU consists of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr), an FU

   The semantics of the FU header fields are as follows:
   S: 1 bit
      When set to one, the S bit indicates the start of a fragmented
      NAL unit i.e., the first byte of the FU payload is also the first
      byte of the payload of the fragmented NAL unit.  When the FU
      payload is not the start of the fragmented NAL unit payload, the
      S bit MUST be set to zero.

   E: 1 bit
      When set to one, the E bit indicates the end of a fragmented NAL
      unit, i.e., the last byte of the payload is also the last byte of
      the fragmented NAL unit.  When the FU payload is not the last
      fragment of a fragmented NAL unit, the E bit MUST be set to zero.

   FuType: 6 bits
      The field FuType MUST be equal to the field Type of the
      fragmented NAL unit.

   The DONL field, when present, specifies the value of the 16 least
   significant bits of the decoding order number of the fragmented NAL
   unit.

   If tx-mode is equal to "MST" or sprop-depack-buf-nalus is greater
   than 0, and the S bit is equal to 1, the DONL field MUST be present
   in the FU, and the variable DON for the fragmented NAL unit is
   derived as equal to the value of the DONL field.  Otherwise (tx-mode
   is equal to "SST" and sprop-depack-buf-nalus is equal to 0, or the S
   bit is equal to 0), the DONL field MUST NOT be present in the FU.

   A non-fragmented NAL unit MUST NOT be transmitted in one FU; i.e.,
   the Start bit and End bit MUST NOT both be set to one in the same FU
   header.

   The  FU  payload  consists  of  fragments  of  the  payload  of  the
   fragmented NAL unit so that if the FU payloads of consecutive FUs,
   starting with an FU with the S bit equal to 1 and ending with an FU
   with the E bit equal to 1, are sequentially concatenated, the
   payload of the fragmented NAL unit can be reconstructed.  The NAL
   unit header of the fragmented NAL unit is not included as such in



Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 34]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   the FU payload, but rather the information of the NAL unit header of
   the fragmented NAL unit is conveyed in F, LayerId, and TID fields of
   the FU payload headers of the FUs and the Type field of the FU
   header of the FUs.  An FU payload MAY have any number of octets and
   MAY be empty.

      Informative note: Empty FU payloads are allowed to reduce the
      latency  of  a  certain  class  of  senders  in  nearly  lossless
      environments.  These senders can be characterized in that they
      packetize  fragments  of  a  NAL  unit  before  the  NAL  unit  is
      completely generated and, hence, before the NAL unit size is
      known.  If zero-length FU payloads were not allowed, the sender
      would have to generate at least one bit of data of the following
      fragment of the NAL unit before the current FU could be sent.
      Due to the characteristics of HEVC, where sometimes several CTUs
      occupy  zero  bits,  this  is  undesirable  and  can  add  delay.
      However, the (potential) use of zero-length FU payloads should be
      carefully weighted against the increased risk of the loss of at
      least a part of the fragmented NAL unit because of the additional
      packets employed for its transmission.

   If  an  FU  is  lost,  the  receiver  SHOULD  discard  all  following
   fragmentation units in transmission order corresponding to the same
   fragmented NAL unit, unless the decoder in the receiver is known to
   be prepared to gracefully handle incomplete NAL units.

   A receiver in an endpoint or in a MANE MAY aggregate the first n-1
   fragments of a NAL unit to an (incomplete) NAL unit, even if
   fragment n of that NAL unit is not received.  In this case, the
   forbidden_zero_bit of the NAL unit MUST be set to one to indicate a
   syntax violation.

5. Packetization Rules

   The following packetization rules apply:

   o  If tx-mode is equal to "MST" or sprop-depack-buf-nalus is greater
      than 0 for an RTP session, the transmission order of NAL units
      carried in the RTP session MAY be different than the NAL unit
      decoding order.  Otherwise (tx-mode is equal to "SST" and sprop-
      depack-buf-nalus  is  equal  to  0  for  an  RTP  session),  the
      transmission order of NAL units carried in the RTP session MUST
      be the same as the NAL unit decoding order.

   o  A  NAL  unit  of  a  small  size  SHOULD  be  encapsulated  in  an
      aggregation packet together with one or more other NAL units in
      order to avoid the unnecessary packetization overhead for small
      NAL units.  For example, non-VCL NAL units such as access unit
      delimiters, parameter sets, or SEI NAL units are typically small
      and  can  often  be  aggregated  with  slice  NAL  units  without
      violating MTU size constraints.

   o  Each non-VCL NAL unit SHOULD be encapsulated in an aggregation
      packet together with its associated VCL NAL unit, as typically a
      non-VCL NAL unit would be meaningless without the associated VCL
      NAL unit being available.FUs SHOULD NOT be applied in live-
      encoding scenarios such as video telephony, video conferencing,
      live streaming and live broadcast, in which cases dependent slice
      segments SHOULD be used when a slice should be transported in
      multiple RTP packets.  For pre-encoded content where using of
      dependent slice segments is not possible without transcoding, FUs
      SHOULD be used for transporting of one NAL unit in multiple RTP
      packets for MTU size matching.

   o  For carrying exactly one NAL unit in an RTP packet, a single NAL
      unit packet MUST be used.

6. De-packetization Process

   The general concept behind de-packetization is to get the NAL units
   out of the RTP packets in an RTP session and all the dependent RTP
   sessions, if any, and pass them to the decoder in the NAL unit
   decoding order.



Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 36]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   The   de-packetization   process   is   implementation   dependent.
   Therefore, the following description should be seen as an example of
   a suitable implementation.  Other schemes may be used as well as
   long as the output for the same input is the same as the process
   described below.  The output is the same when the set of NAL units
   and their order are both identical.  Optimizations relative to the
   described algorithms are possible.

   All normal RTP mechanisms related to buffer management apply.  In
   particular, duplicated or outdated RTP packets (as indicated by the
   RTP sequences number and the RTP timestamp) are removed.  To
   determine the exact time for decoding, factors such as a possible
   intentional delay to allow for proper inter-stream synchronization
   must be factored in.

   NAL units with NAL unit type values in the range of 0 to 47,
   inclusive may be passed to the decoder.  NAL-unit-like structures
   with NAL unit type values in the range of 48 to 63, inclusive, MUST
   NOT be passed to the decoder.

   The receiver includes a receiver buffer, which is used to compensate
   for  transmission  delay  jitter,  to  reorder  NAL  units  from
   transmission order to the NAL unit decoding order, and to recover
   the NAL unit decoding order in MST, when applicable.  In this
   section, the receiver operation is described under the assumption
   that there is no transmission delay jitter.  To make a difference
   from a practical receiver buffer that is also used for compensation
   of transmission delay jitter, the receiver buffer is here after
   called the de-packetization buffer in this section.  Receivers
   SHOULD also prepare for transmission delay jitter; i.e., either
   reserve separate buffers for transmission delay jitter buffering and
   de-packetization  buffering  or  use  a  receiver  buffer  for  both
   transmission delay jitter and de-packetization.  Moreover, receivers
   SHOULD take transmission delay jitter into account in the buffering
   operation; e.g., by additional initial buffering before starting of
   decoding and playback.

   There are two buffering states in the receiver: initial buffering
   and buffering while playing.  Initial buffering starts when the
   reception is initialized.  After initial buffering, decoding and
   playback are started, and the buffering-while-playing mode is used.


Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 37]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   Regardless of the buffering state, the receiver stores incoming NAL
   units, in reception order, into the de-packetization buffer.  NAL
   units carried in single NAL unit packets, APs, and FUs are stored in
   the de-packetization buffer individually, and the value of AbsDon is
   calculated and stored for each NAL unit.  When MST is in use, NAL
   units  of  all  RTP  packet  streams  are  stored  in  the  same  de-
   packetization buffer.

   Initial buffering lasts until condition A (the number of NAL units
   in the de-packetization buffer is greater than the value of sprop-
   depack-buf-nalus of the highest RTP session) is true.

   After initial buffering, whenever condition A is true, the following
   operation is repeatedly applied until condition A becomes false:

   o  The NAL unit in the de-packetization buffer with the smallest
      value of AbsDon is removed from the de-packetization buffer and
      passed to the decoder.

   When no more NAL units are flowing into the de-packetization buffer,
   all NAL units remaining in the de-packetization buffer are removed
   from the buffer and passed to the decoder in the order of increasing
   AbsDon values.

7. Payload Format Parameters

   This section specifies the parameters that MAY be used to select
   optional features of the payload format and certain features or
   properties of the bitstream.  The parameters are specified here as
   part of the media type registration for the HEVC codec.  A mapping
   of  the  parameters  into  the  Session  Description  Protocol  (SDP)
   [RFC4566]  is  also  provided  for  applications  that  use  SDP.
   Equivalent  parameters  could  be  defined  elsewhere  for  use  with
   control protocols that do not use SDP.

7.1 Media Type Registration

   The media subtype for the HEVC codec is allocated from the IETF
   tree.

   The receiver MUST ignore any unspecified parameter.

   Media Type name:     video

   Media subtype name:  H265

   Required parameters: none

   OPTIONAL parameters:

      In the following definitions of parameters, "the stream" or "the
      NAL unit stream" refers to all NAL units conveyed in the current
      RTP session in SST, and all NAL units conveyed in the current RTP
      session and all NAL units conveyed in other RTP sessions that the
      current RTP session depends on in MST.

      profile-space, profile-id:

         The  profile-space  parameter  indicates  the  context  for
         interpretation  of  the  profile-id  parameter  value.    The
         profile, which specifies the subset of coding tools that may
         have been used to generate the stream or that the receiver
         supports,  as  specified  in  [HEVC],  is  defined  by  the
         combination  of  profile-space  and  profile-id.    Note  that
         profile-space is required to be equal to 0 in [HEVC], but
         other values for it may be specified in the future by ITU-T or
         ISO/IEC.

         If the profile-space and profile-id parameters are used to
         indicate properties of a NAL unit stream, it indicates that,
         to decode the stream, the minimum subset of coding tools a
         decoder has to support is the profile specified by both
         parameters.

         If the profile-space and profile-id parameters are used for
         capability exchange or session setup, it indicates the subset
         of coding tools, which is equal to the profile, that the codec
         supports for both receiving and sending.

         If no profile-space is present, a value of 0 MUST be inferred
         and if no profile-id is present the Main profile MUST be
         inferred.

         The profile-space and profile-id parameters are derived from
         the sequence parameter set or video parameter set NAL units,
         as specified in [HEVC], as follows.

         For SST or for the stream corresponding to the highest RTP
         session of MST when MST is applied, the following applies:

         o  profile_space = general_profile_space
         o  profile_id = general_profile_idc

         For streams not corresponding to the highest RTP session of
         MST when MST is applied, the following applies, with j being
         the value of the sub-layer-id parameter:

         o  profile_space = sub_layer_profile_space[j]
         o  profile_id = sub_layer_profile_idc[j]

      tier-flag, level-id:

         The   tier-flag   parameter   indicates   the   context   for
         interpretation of the level-id value.  The default level,
         which limits values of syntax elements or on arithmetic
         combinations of values of syntax elements, as specified in
         [HEVC], is defined by the combination of tier-flag and level-
         id.

         If the tier-flag and level-id parameters are used to indicate
         properties of a NAL unit stream, it indicates that, to decode
         the stream the lowest level the decoder has to support is the
         default level.

         If  the  tier-flag  and  level-id  parameters  are  used  for
         capability exchange or session setup, the following applies.
         If max-recv-level-id is not present, the default level defined
         by tier-flag and level-id indicates the highest level the
         codec wishes to support.  Otherwise, tier-flag and max-recv-
         level-id indicate the highest level the codec supports for
         receiving.  For either receiving or sending, all levels that
         are lower than the highest level supported MUST also be
         supported.

         If no tier-flag is present, a value of 0 MUST be inferred and
         if no level-id is present, a value of 30 (i.e. level 1.0) MUST
         be inferred.

         The tier-flag and level-id parameters are derived from the
         sequence parameter set or video parameter set NAL units, as
         specified in [HEVC], as follows.

         For SST or for the stream corresponding to the highest RTP
         session of MST when MST is applied, the following applies:

         o  tier-flag = general_tier_flag
         o  level-id = general_level_idc

         For streams not corresponding to the highest RTP session of
         MST when MST is applied, the following applies, with j being
         the value of the sub-layer-id parameter:

         o  tier-flag = sub_layer_tier_flag[j]
         o  level-id = sub_layer_level_idc[j]

      interop-constraints:

         A base16 [RFC4648] (hexadecimal) representation of the six
         bytes  derived  from  the  sequence  parameter  set  or  video
         parameter set NAL units as specified in [HEVC] consisting of
         progressive_source_flag,               interlaced_source_flag,
         non_packed_constraint_flag,  frame_only_constraint_flag,  and
         reserved_zero_44bits.    Note  that  reserved_zero_44bits  is
         required to be equal to 0 in [HEVC], but other values for it
         may be specified in the future by ITU-T or ISO/IEC.

         If no interop-constraints are present, the following MUST be
         inferred:

         o  progressive_source_flag = 1
         o  interlaced_source_flag = 0
         o  non_packed_constraint_flag = 1
         o  frame_only_constraint_flag = 1
         o  reserved_zero_44bits = 0

      profile-compatibility-indicator:

         decoder conforming to a certain profile may be able to decode
         bitstreams  conforming  to  other  profiles.    The  profile-
         compatibility-indicator  provides  exact  information  of  the
         ability of a decoder conforming to a certain profile to decode
         bitstreams conforming to another profile.  More concretely, if
         the profile compatibility flag corresponding to the profile,
         which a decoder conforms to, is set, then the decoder is able
         to decode that bitstream with the flag set, irrespective of
         the profile, which a bitstream conforms to (provided that the
         decoder supports the highest level of the bitstream).

         This parameter MAY be used to signal a receiver's choice of
         the offers or declared sub-layers in the sprop-vps.  The value
         of recv-sub-layer-id indicates the index of the highest sub-
         layer of the stream that a receiver supports.  When not
         present, the value of recv-sub-layer-id is inferred to be
         equal to sub-layer-id.

      max-recv-level-id:

         This parameter MAY be used, together with tier-flag, to
         indicate the highest level a receiver supports. The highest
         level the receiver supports is equal to the value of max-recv-
         level-id  divided  by  30  for  the  Main  or  High  tier  (as
         determined by tier-flag equal to 0 or 1, respectively).

         When max-recv-level-id is not present, the value is inferred
         to be equal to level-id.

         max-recv-level-id MUST NOT be present when the highest level
         the receiver supports is not higher than the default level.

      sprop-vps:

         This parameter MAY be used to convey any video parameter set
         NAL unit of the stream.  When present, the parameter MAY be
         used   to   indicate   codec   capability   and   sub-stream
         characteristics (i.e. properties of representations of sub-
         layers as defined in [HEVC]) as well as for out-of-band
         transmission of video parameter sets.  The value of the
         parameter is a comma-separated (',') list of base64 [RFC4648]
         representations of the video parameter set NAL units as
         specified in Section 7.3.2.1 of [HEVC].

      sprop-sps:

         This parameter MAY be used to convey sequence parameter set
         NAL units of the stream for out-of-band transmission of
         sequence parameter sets.  The value of the parameter is a
         comma-separated (',') list of base64 [RFC4648] representations
         of the sequence parameter set NAL units as specified in
         Section 7.3.2.2 of [HEVC].

      sprop-pps:

         This parameter MAY be used to convey picture parameter set NAL
         units of the stream for out-of-band transmission of picture
         parameter sets.  The value of the parameter is a comma-
         separated (',') list of base64 [RFC4648] representations of
         the picture parameter set NAL units as specified in Section
         7.3.2.3 of [HEVC].

      max-ls, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, max-br:

         These parameters MAY be used to signal the capabilities of a
         receiver implementation. These parameters MUST NOT be used for
         any other purpose.  The highest level (specified by tier-flag



Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 44]

         and max-recv-level-id) MUST be such that the receiver is fully
         capable of supporting.  max-ls, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, and
         max-br MAY be used to indicate capabilities of the receiver
         that extend the required capabilities of the signaled highest
         level, as specified below.

         When more than one parameter from the set (max-ls, max-lps,
         max-cpb,  max-dpb,  max-br)  is  present,  the  receiver  MUST
         support  all  signaled  capabilities  simultaneously.    For
         example, if both max-ls and max-br are present, the signaled
         highest level with the extension of both the frame rate and
         bitrate is supported.  That is, the receiver is able to decode
         NAL unit streams in which the luma sample rate is up to max-ls
         (inclusive), the bitrate is up to max-br (inclusive), the
         coded picture buffer size is derived as specified in the
         semantics  of  the  max-br  parameter  below,  and  the  other
         properties comply with the highest level specified by tier-
         flag and max-recv-level-id.

            Informative note: When the OPTIONAL media type parameters
            are used to signal the properties of a NAL unit stream,
            max-ls,  max-lps,  max-cpb,  max-dpb,  and  max-br  are  not
            present, and the value of profile-space, profile-id, tier-
            flag and level-id must always be such that the NAL unit
            stream complies fully with the specified profile and level.

      max-ls:
         The value of max-ls is an integer indicating the maximum
         processing rate in units of luma samples per second. The max-
         ls parameter signals that the receiver is capable of decoding
         video at a higher rate than is required by the signaled
         highest level.

         When max-ls is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to decode
         NAL unit streams that conform to the signaled highest level,
         with the exception that the MaxLumaSR value in Table A-2 of
         [HEVC] for the signaled highest level is replaced with the
         value of max-ls. The value of max-ls MUST be greater than or
         equal to the value of MaxLumaSR given in Table A-2 of [HEVC]
         for the highest level. Senders MAY use this knowledge to send

         pictures of a given size at a higher picture rate than is
         indicated in the signaled highest level.

      max-lps:
         The value of max-lps is an integer indicating the maximum
         picture size in units of luma samples.  The max-lps parameter
         signals that the receiver is capable of decoding larger
         picture sizes than are required by the signaled highest level.
         When max-lps is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to decode
         NAL unit streams that conform to the signaled highest level,
         with the exception that the MaxLumaPS value in Table A-1 of
         [HEVC] for the signaled highest level is replaced with the
         value of max-lps. The value of max-lps MUST be greater than or
         equal to the value of MaxLumaPS given in Table A-1 of [HEVC]
         for the highest level. Senders MAY use this knowledge to send
         larger pictures at a proportionally lower frame rate than is
         indicated in the signaled highest level.

      max-cpb:
         The value of max-cpb is an integer indicating the maximum
         coded picture buffer size in units of CpbBrVclFactor bits for
         the VCL HRD parameters and in units of CpbBrNalFactor bits for
         the   NAL   HRD   parameters,   where   CpbBrVclFactor   and
         CpbBrNalFactor are defined in Section A.4 of [HEVC].  The max-
         cpb parameter signals that the receiver has more memory than
         the minimum amount of coded picture buffer memory required by
         the signaled highest level. When max-cpb is signaled, the
         receiver MUST be able to decode NAL unit streams that conform
         to the signaled highest level, with the exception that the
         MaxCPB value in Table A-1 of [HEVC] for the signaled highest
         level is replaced with the value of max-cpb. The value of max-
         cpb MUST be greater than or equal to the value of MaxCPB given
         in Table A-1 of [HEVC] for the highest level. Senders MAY use
         this knowledge to construct coded video streams with greater
         variation of bitrate than can be achieved with the MaxCPB
         value in Table A-1 of [HEVC].

            Informative note: The coded picture buffer is used in the
            hypothetical reference decoder (Annex C of HEVC). The use
            of the hypothetical reference decoder is recommended in
            HEVC  encoders  to  verify  that  the  produced  bitstream


Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 46]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


            conforms to the standard and to control the output bitrate.
            Thus, the coded picture buffer is conceptually independent
            of any other potential buffers in the receiver, including
            de-packetization and de-jitter buffers. The coded picture
            buffer need not be implemented in decoders as specified in
            Annex C of HEVC, but rather standard-compliant decoders can
            have any buffering arrangements provided that they can
            decode standard-compliant bitstreams. Thus, in practice,
            the input buffer for a video decoder can be integrated with
            de-packetization and de-jitter buffers of the receiver.

      max-dpb:
         The value of max-dpb is an integer indicating the maximum
         decoded picture buffer size in units decoded pictures at the
         MaxLumaPS for the highest level, i.e. number of decoded
         pictures at the maximum picture size defined by the highest
         level. The value of max-dpb MUST be smaller than or equal to
         16. The max-dpb parameter signals that the receiver has more
         memory than the minimum amount of decoded picture buffer
         memory required by default, which is MaxDpbPicBuf as defined
         in [HEVC] (equal to 6). When max-dpb is signaled, the receiver
         MUST be able to decode NAL unit streams that conform to the
         signaled  highest  level,  with  the  exception  that  the
         MaxDpbPicBuff value defined in [HEVC] as 6 is replaced with
         the value of max-dpb. Consequently, a receiver that signals
         max-dpb MUST be capable of storing the following number of
         decoded frames (MaxDpbSize) in its decoded picture buffer:

                          if( PicSizeInSamplesY <= ( MaxLumaPS >> 2 ) )
              MaxDpbSize = Min( 4 * max-dpb, 16 )
           else if ( PicSizeInSamplesY <= ( MaxLumaPS >> 1 ) )
              MaxDpbSize = Min( 2 * max-dpb, 16 )
           else if ( PicSizeInSamplesY <= ( ( 3 * MaxLumaPS ) >> 2 ) )
              MaxDpbSize = Min( (4 * max-dpb) / 3, 16 )
           else
              MaxDpbSize = max-dpb

                        Wherein MaxLumaPS given in Table A-1 of [HEVC] for the highest
         level and PicSizeInSamplesY is the current size of each
         decoded picture in units of luma samples as defined in [HEVC].

                        The value of max-dpb MUST be greater than or equal to the
         value of MaxDpbPicBuf (i.e. 6) as defined in [HEVC]. Senders
         MAY use this knowledge to construct coded video streams with
         improved compression.

                              Informative note: This parameter was added primarily to
            complement a similar codepoint in the ITU-T Recommendation
            H.245, so as to facilitate signaling gateway designs. The
            decoded picture buffer stores reconstructed samples. There
            is no relationship between the size of the decoded picture
            buffer  and  the  buffers  used  in  RTP,  especially  de-
            packetization and de-jitter buffers.

      max-br:
         The value of max-br is an integer indicating the maximum video
         bitrate in units of CpbBrVclFactor bits per second for the VCL
         HRD parameters and in units of CpbBrNalFactor bits per second
         for  the  NAL  HRD  parameters,  where  CpbBrVclFactor  and
         CpbBrNalFactor are defined in Section A.4 of [HEVC].

                        The max-br parameter signals that the video decoder of the
         receiver is capable of decoding video at a higher bitrate than
         is required by the signaled highest level.

                        When max-br is signaled, the video codec of the receiver MUST
         be able to decode NAL unit streams that conform to the
         signaled highest level, with the following exceptions in the
         limits specified by the highest level:

                        o  The value of max-br  replaces the MaxBR value in Table A-2
         of [HEVC] for the highest level.

                        o  When the max-cpb parameter is not present, the result of
         the following formula replaces the value of MaxCPB in Table A-
         1 of [HEVC]:

                             (MaxCPB of the signaled level) * max-br / (MaxBR of the
              signaled highest level).

                        For example, if a receiver signals capability for Main profile
         Level 2 with max-br equal to 2000, this indicates a maximum

         video bitrate of 2000 kbits/sec for VCL HRD parameters, a
         maximum  video  bitrate  of  2200  kbits/sec  for  NAL  HRD
         parameters, and a CPB size of 2000000 bits (2000000 / 1500000
         * 1500000).

                        The value of max-br  MUST be greater than or equal to the
         value MaxBR given in Table A-2 of [HEVC] for the signaled
         highest level.

                        Senders MAY use this knowledge to send higher bitrate video as
         allowed in the level definition of Annex A of HEVC to achieve
         improved video quality.

            Informative note: This parameter was added primarily to
            complement a similar codepoint in the ITU-T Recommendation
            H.245, so as to facilitate signaling gateway designs.  The
            assumption that the network is capable of handling such
            bitrates at any given time cannot be made from the value of
            this parameter.  In particular, no conclusion can be drawn
            that the signaled bitrate is possible under congestion
            control constraints.

      tx-mode:

         This parameter indicates whether the transmission mode is SST
         or MST.

         The value of tx-mode MUST be equal to either "MST" or "SST".
         When not present, the value of tx-mode is inferred to be equal
         to "SST".

         If the value is equal to "MST", MST MUST be in use.  Otherwise
         (the value is equal to "SST"), SST MUST be in use.

         The value of tx-mode MUST be equal to "MST" for all RTP
         sessions in an MST.

      sprop-depack-buf-nalus:






Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 49]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


         This parameter specifies the maximum number of NAL units that
         precede a NAL unit in the de-packetization buffer in reception
         order and follow the NAL unit in decoding order.

         The value of sprop-depack-buf-nalus MUST be an integer in the
         range of 0 to 32767, inclusive.

         When not present, the value of sprop-depack-buf-nalus is
         inferred to be equal to 0.

         When the RTP session depends on one or more other RTP sessions
         (in this case tx-mode MUST be equal to "MST"), this parameter
         MUST be present and the value of sprop-depack-buf-nalus MUST
         be greater than 0.

      sprop-depack-buf-bytes:

         This  parameter  signals  the  required  size  of  the  de-
         packetization buffer in units of bytes.  The value of the
         parameter MUST be greater than or equal to the maximum buffer
         occupancy (in units of bytes) of the de-packetization buffer
         as specified in section 6.

         The value of sprop-depack-buf-bytes MUST be an integer in the
         range of 0 to 4294967295, inclusive.

         When the RTP session depends on one or more other RTP sessions
         (in this case tx-mode MUST be equal to "MST") or sprop-depack-
         buf-nalus is present and is greater than 0, this parameter
         MUST be present and the value of sprop-depack-buf-bytes MUST
         be greater than 0.

            Informative  note:  sprop-depack-buf-bytes  indicates  the
            required size of the de-packetization buffer only.  When
            network jitter can occur, an appropriately sized jitter
            buffer has to be available as well.

      depack-buf-cap:

         This  parameter  signals  the  capabilities  of  a  receiver
         implementation and indicates the amount of de-packetization

         buffer space in units of bytes that the receiver has available
         for reconstructing the NAL unit decoding order.  A receiver is
         able to handle any stream for which the value of the sprop-
         depack-buf-bytes parameter is smaller than or equal to this
         parameter.

         When not present, the value of depack-buf-req is inferred to
         be equal to 0.  The value of depack-buf-cap MUST be an integer
         in the range of 0 to 4294967295, inclusive.

            Informative  note:  depack-buf-cap  indicates  the  maximum
            possible  size  of  the  de-packetization  buffer  of  the
            receiver  only.    When  network  jitter  can  occur,  an
            appropriately sized jitter buffer has to be available as
            well.

      segmentation-id:

         This parameter MAY be used to signal the segmentation tools
         present  in  the  stream  and  that  can  be  used  for
         parallelization.  The value of segmentation-id MUST be an
         integer in the range of 0 to 3, inclusive.  When not present,
         the value of segmentation-id is inferred to be equal to 0.

         When segmentation-id is equal to 0, no information about the
         segmentation tools is provided.  When segmentation-id is equal
         to 1, it indicates that slices are present in the stream.
         When segmentation-id is equal to 2, it indicates that tiles
         are present in the stream.  When segmentation-id is equal to
         3, it indicates that WPP is used in the stream.

      spatial-segmentation-idc:

         min_spatial_segmentation_idc as specified in [HEVC].  This
         parameter MAY be used to describe parallelization capabilities

      "depack-buf-cap",  "segmentation-id",  and  "spatial-segmentation-
      idc", when present, MUST be included in the "a=fmtp" line of SDP.
      This parameter is expressed as a media type string, in the form
      of a semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   o  The OPTIONAL parameters "sprop-vps", "sprop-sps", and "sprop-
      pps", when present, MUST be included in the "a=fmtp" line of SDP
      or conveyed using the "fmtp" source attribute as specified in
      section 6.3 of [RFC5576].  For a particular media format (i.e.,
      RTP payload type), "sprop-vps" "sprop-sps", or "sprop-pps" MUST
      NOT be both included in the "a=fmtp" line of SDP and conveyed
      using the "fmtp" source attribute.  When included in the "a=fmtp"
      line of SDP, these parameters are expressed as a media type
      string,  in  the  form  of  a  semicolon  separated  list  of
      parameter=value pairs.  When conveyed using the "fmtp" source
      attribute, these parameters are only associated with the given
      source and payload type as parts of the "fmtp" source attribute.

          Informative note: Conveyance of "sprop-vps", "sprop-sps", and
          "sprop-pps" using the "fmtp" source attribute allows for out-
          of-band transport of parameter sets in topologies like Topo-
          Video-switch-MCU as specified in [RFC5117].

   An example of media representation in SDP is as follows:

         m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 98
         a=rtpmap:98 H265/90000
         a=fmtp:98 profile-id=ST;
                   sprop-vps=<video parameter sets data>

7.2.2 Usage with SDP Offer/Answer Model

   When HEVC is offered over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264]  for  negotiation  for  unicast  usage,  the  following
   limitations and rules apply:




Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 53]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   o  The parameters identifying a media format configuration for HEVC
      are  profile-space,  profile-id,  tier-flag,  level-id,  interop-
      constraints, tx-mode, and sprop-depack-buf-nalus.  These media
      configuration  parameters,  except  for  level-id,  MUST  be  used
      symmetrically when the answerer does not include recv-sub-layer-
      id in the answer; i.e., the answerer MUST either maintain all
      configuration parameters or remove the media format (payload
      type) completely, if one or more of the parameter values are not
      supported. The value of level-id) is changeable.

          Informative note: The requirement for symmetric use does not
          apply for level-id, and does not apply for the other stream
          properties and capability parameters.

   To simplify handling and matching of these configurations, the same
   RTP payload type number used in the offer SHOULD also be used in the
   answer, as specified in [RFC3264].  The same RTP payload type number
   used in the offer MUST also be used in the answer when the answer
   includes recv-sub-layer-id.  When the answer does not include recv-
   sub-layer-id, the answer MUST NOT contain a payload type number used
   in the offer unless the configuration is exactly the same as in the
   offer or the configuration in the answer only differs from that in
   the offer with a different value of level-id.  The answer MAY
   contain the recv-sub-layer-id parameter if an HEVC stream contains
   multiple  operation  points  (using  temporal  scalability  and  sub-
   layers) and sprop-vps is included in the offer where sub-layers are
   present in the video parameter set.  If the sprop-vps is provided in
   an offer, an answerer MAY select a particular operation point in the
   received and/or in the sent stream.  When recv-sub-layer-id is
   present in the answer, the media configuration parameters MUST NOT
   be present in the answer.  Rather, the media configuration that the
   answerer will use for receiving and/or sending is the one used for
   the selected operation point as indicated in the offer.

          Informative note: When an offerer receives an answer that
          does not include recv-sub-layer-id, it has to compare payload
          types not declared in the offer based on the media type
          (i.e.,  video/H265)  and  the  above  media  configuration
          parameters with any payload types it has already declared.
          This will enable it to determine whether the configuration in
          question is new or if it is equivalent to configuration


Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 54]

          already offered, since a different payload type number may be
          used in the answer.  The ability to perform operation point
          selection enables a receiver to utilize the temporal scalable
          nature of an HEVC stream.

   o  The parameters sprop-depack-buf-nalus and sprop-depack-buf-bytes
      describe the properties of the RTP packet stream that the offerer
      or the answerer is sending for the media format configuration.
      This  differs  from  the  normal  usage  of  the  Offer/Answer
      parameters: normally such parameters declare the properties of
      the stream that the offerer or the answerer is able to receive.
      When dealing with HEVC, the offerer assumes that the answerer
      will be able to receive media encoded using the configuration
      being offered.

            Informative note:  The above parameters apply for any
            stream  sent  by  a  declaring  entity  with  the  same
            configuration; i.e., they are dependent on their source.
            Rather than being bound to the payload type, the values may
            have to be applied to another payload type when being sent,
            as they apply for the configuration.

   o  The capability parameters max-ls, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, and
      max-br MAY be used to declare further capabilities of the offerer
      or answerer for receiving. These parameters MUST NOT be present
      when  the  direction  attribute  is  "sendonly"  and  when  the
      parameters  describe  the  limitations  of  what  the  offerer  or
      answerer accepts for receiving streams.

   o  An offerer has to include the size of the de-packetization
      buffer,  sprop-depack-buf-bytes,  and  sprop-depack-buf-nalus,  in
      the  offer  for  an  interleaved  HEVC  stream  or  for  the  MST
      transmission mode.  To enable the offerer and answerer to inform
      each  other  about  their  capabilities  for  de-packetization
      buffering in receiving streams, both parties are RECOMMENDED to
      include depack-buf-cap.  For interleaved streams or in MST, it is
      also RECOMMENDED to consider offering multiple payload types with
      different buffering requirements when the capabilities of the
      receiver are unknown.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   For streams being delivered over multicast, the following rules
   apply:

   o  The media format configuration is identified by profile-space,
      profile-id, tier-flag, level-id, interop-constraints, tx-mode and
      sprop-depack-buf-nalus.    These  media  format  configuration
      parameters, including level-id, MUST be used symmetrically; that
      is,  the  answerer  MUST  either  maintain  all  configuration
      parameters or remove the media format (payload type) completely.
      Note that this implies that the level-id for Offer/Answer in
      multicast is not changeable.

   To simplify the handling and matching of these configurations, the
   same RTP payload type number used in the offer SHOULD also be used
   in the answer, as specified in [RFC3264].  An answer MUST NOT
   contain  a  payload  type  number  used  in  the  offer  unless  the
   configuration is the same as in the offer.

   o  The rules for other parameters are the same as above for unicast
      as long as the above rules are obeyed.

   Table 1 lists the interpretation of all the parameters that MUST be
   used for the various combinations of offer, answer, and direction
   attributes.  Note that the two columns wherein the recv-sub-layer-id
   parameter is used only apply to answers, whereas the other columns
   apply to both offers and answers.

      R: receiver capabilities

      X: MUST NOT be present
      -: not usable, when present SHOULD be ignored

   Parameters used for declaring receiver capabilities are in general
   downgradable; i.e., they express the upper limit for a sender's
   possible behavior.  Thus, a sender MAY select to set its encoder
   using only lower/lesser or equal values of these parameters.

   Parameters declaring a configuration point are not changeable, with
   the exception of the level-id parameter for unicast usage.  This
   expresses values a receiver expects to be used and MUST be used
   verbatim on the sender side.  If level-id is changed, an answerer
   MUST NOT include the recv-sub-layer-id parameter.

   When  a  sender's  capabilities  are  declared,  and  non-changeable
   parameters are used in this declaration, these parameters express a
   configuration that is acceptable for the sender to receive streams.

   In order to achieve high interoperability levels, it is often
   advisable to offer multiple alternative configurations.  It is
   impossible to offer multiple configurations in a single payload
   type.  Thus, when multiple configuration offers are made, each offer
   requires its own RTP payload type associated with the offer.

   A receiver SHOULD understand all media type parameters, even if it
   only supports a subset of the payload format's functionality.  This
   ensures that a receiver is capable of understanding when an offer to
   receive media can be downgraded to what is supported by the receiver
   of the offer.

   An answerer MAY extend the offer with additional media format
   configurations.  However, to enable their usage, in most cases a
   second offer is required from the offerer to provide the stream
   property parameters that the media sender will use.  This also has
   the effect that the offerer has to be able to receive this media
   format configuration, not only to send it.

7.2.3 Usage in Declarative Session Descriptions

   When HEVC over RTP is offered with SDP in a declarative style, as in
   Real  Time  Streaming  Protocol  (RTSP)  [RFC2326]  or  Session
   Announcement Protocol (SAP) [RFC2974], the following considerations
   are necessary.

   o  All parameters capable of indicating both stream properties and
      receiver  capabilities  are  used  to  indicate  only  stream
      properties. For example, in this case, the parameter profile-
      tier-level-id declares the values used by the stream, not the
      capabilities for receiving streams.  This results in that the
      following interpretation of the parameters MUST be used:

   Declaring actual configuration or stream properties:

     - profile-space
     - profile-id
     - tier-flag
     - level-id
     - interop-constraints
     - tx-mode

     - sprop-parameter-sets
     - sprop-depack-buf-nalus
     - sprop-depack-buf-bytes
     - segmentation-id
     - spatial-segmentation-idc

   Not usable (when present, they SHOULD be ignored):

     - max-lps
     - max-ls
     - max-cpb
     - max-dpb
     - max-br
     - max-recv-level-id
     - depack-buf-cap
     - sub-layer-id

   o  A receiver of the SDP is required to support all parameters and
      values of the parameters provided; otherwise, the receiver MUST
      reject (RTSP) or not participate in (SAP) the session.  It falls
      on the creator of the session to use values that are expected to
      be supported by the receiving application.

7.2.4 Dependency Signaling in Multi-Session Transmission

   If MST is used, the rules on signaling media decoding dependency in
   SDP as defined in [RFC5583] apply.  The rules on "hierarchical or
   layered encoding" with multicast in Section 5.7 of [RFC4566] do not
   apply, i.e., the notation for Connection Data "c=" SHALL NOT be used
   with more than one address.  The order of session dependency is
   given from the RTP session containing the lowest temporal sub-layer
   to the RTP session containing the highest temporal sub-layer.

8. Use with Feedback Messages

   As specified in section 6.1 of RFC 4585 [RFC4585], payload Specific
   Feedback messages are identified by the RTCP packet type value PSFB
   (206).    AVPF  [RFC4585]  defines  three  payload-specific  feedback
   messages  and  one  application  layer  feedback  message,  and  CCM
   [RFC5104] specifies four payload-specific feedback messages.

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   In  addition,  this  memo  defines  one  payload-specific  feedback
   message.

   These feedback messages are identified by means of the feedback
   message type (FMT) parameter as follows:

   Assigned in [RFC4585]:

      1:     Picture Loss Indication (PLI)
      2:     Slice Lost Indication (SLI)
      3:     Reference Picture Selection Indication (RPSI)
      15:    Application layer FB message
      31:    reserved for future expansion of the number space

   Assigned in [RFC5104]:

      4:     Full Intra Request (FIR) Command
      5:     Temporal-Spatial Trade-off Request (TSTR)
      6:     Temporal-Spatial Trade-off Notification (TSTN)
      7:     Video Back Channel Message (VBCM)

   Assigned in this memo:

      8:     Specific Picture Loss Indication (SPLI)

   Unassigned:

      0:      unassigned
      9-14:   unassigned
      16-30:  unassigned



   The following subsections define the Feedback Control Information
   (FCI) format for the new payload-specific feedback message and how
   to use HEVC with the RPSI and SPLI messages, both for the purpose of
   feedback  based  reference  picture  selection  for  improved  error
   resilience in real-time conversational video applications such as
   video telephone and video conferencing.

   Feedback based reference picture selection has been shown as a
   powerful tool to stop temporal error propagation for improved error

   resilience [Girod99][Wang05].  In one approach, the decoder side
   tracks errors in the decoded pictures and informs to the encoder
   side that a particular picture that has been decoded relatively
   earlier is correct and still present in the decoded picture buffer
   and requests the encoder to use that correct picture for reference
   when encoding the next picture, so to stop further temporal error
   propagation.  For this approach, the decoder side should use the
   RPSI feedback message.  In another approach, the decoder side only
   reports, to the encoder side, which pictures has been entirely or
   partially  lost,  and  the  encoder  tracks  errors  in  the  decoded
   pictures at the decoder side based on the feedback messages, and if
   it infers that an earlier decoded picture is correct at the decoder
   side and is still in the decoded picture buffer of the decoder, it
   encodes the next picture using that correct picture for reference.
   The SPLI message defined below is for use with the second approach
   described above.

   Encoders can encode some long-term reference pictures as specified
   in H.264 or HEVC for purposes described in the previous paragraph
   without the need of a huge decoded picture buffer.  As shown in
   [Wang05], with a flexible reference picture management scheme as in
   H.264 and HEVC, even a decoded picture buffer size of two would work
   for both the approaches described in the previous paragraph.

8.1 Definition of the SPLI Feedback Message

   The SPLI feedback message is identified by PT=PSFB and FMT=8.  There
   MUST be exactly one SPLI contained in the FCI field.

      Informative note: The SPLI message defined in this memo also
      applies to other codecs, and may later be moved to another
      extension of RFC 4585.

   The FCI format of the SPLI message is exactly the same as that of
   the RPSI message, with the name of the field "Native RPSI bit string
   defined per codec" being replaced with "Native SPLI bit string
   defined per codec", as shown in Figure 11.

8.2 Use of HEVC with the RPSI Feedback Message

   The field "Native RPSI bit string defined per codec" is a base16
   [RFC4648]  representation  of  the  8  bits  consisting  of  2  most
   significant bits equal to 0 and 6 bits of nuh_layer_id, as defined
   in [HEVC], followed by the 32 bits representing the value of the
   PicOrderCntVal (in network byte order), as defined in [HEVC], for
   the picture that is requested to be used for reference when encoding
   the next picture.

   Use of the RPSI feedback message as positive acknowledgement is
   deprecated.  In other words, the RPSI feedback message MUST only be
   used as a reference picture selection request, such that it can also
   be used in multicast.

8.3 Use of HEVC with the SPLI Feedback Message

   The field "Native SPLI bit string defined per codec" is a base16
   [RFC4648]  representation  of  the  8  bits  consisting  of  2  most
   significant bits equal to 0 and 6 bits of nuh_layer_id, as defined
   in [HEVC], followed by the 32 bits representing the value of the
   PicOrderCntVal, as defined in [HEVC], for the picture that is
   indicated as entirely or partially lost.

9. Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550], and in any applicable RTP profile such as
   RTP/AVP  [RFC3551],  RTP/AVPF  [RFC4585],  RTP/SAVP  [RFC3711]  or
   RTP/SAVPF  [RFC5124].    However,  as  "Securing  the  RTP  Protocol
   Framework:  Why  RTP  Does  Not  Mandate  a  Single  Media  Security
   Solution" [I-D.ietf-avt-srtp-not-mandatory] discusses it is not an
   RTP payload format's responsibility to discuss or mandate what
   solutions  are  used  to  meet  the  basic  security  goals  like
   confidentiality,  integrity,  and  source  authenticity  for  RTP  in
   general.  This responsibility lays on anyone using RTP in an
   application.    They  can  find  guidance  on  available  security
   mechanisms and important considerations as discussed in "Options for
   Securing RTP Sessions" [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options].

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   The rest of this section discusses the security impacting properties
   of the payload format itself.

   Because the data compression used with this payload format is
   applied end-to-end, any encryption needs to be performed after
   compression.  A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data
   encodings  using  compression  techniques  that  have  non-uniform
   receiver-end  computational  load.    The  attacker  can  inject
   pathological datagrams into the stream that are complex to decode
   and that cause the receiver to be overloaded.  H.265 is particularly
   vulnerable to such attacks, as it is extremely simple to generate
   datagrams containing NAL units that affect the decoding process of
   many  future  NAL  units.    Therefore,  the  usage  of  data  origin
   authentication and data integrity protection of at least the RTP
   packet is RECOMMENDED, for example, with SRTP [RFC 3711].

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to ensure confidentiality and
   integrity of RTP packets and their payloads is very dependent on the
   application and on the transport and signaling protocols employed.
   Thus, although SRTP is given as an example above, other possible
   choices exist.

   Decoders MUST exercise caution with respect to the handling of user
   data SEI messages, particularly if they contain active elements, and
   MUST restrict their domain of applicability to the presentation
   containing the stream.

   End-to-end    security    with    authentication,    integrity,    or
   confidentiality  protection  will  prevent  a  MANE  from  performing
   media-aware operations other than discarding complete packets.  In
   the case of confidentiality protection, it will even be prevented
   from discarding packets in a media-aware way.  To be allowed to
   perform such operations, a MANE is required to be a trusted entity
   that is included in the security context establishment.

10. Congestion Control

   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RTP
   [RFC3550] and with any applicable RTP profile, e.g., AVP [RFC 3551].
   If best-effort service is being used, an additional requirement is
   that users of this payload format MUST monitor packet loss to ensure


Wang, et al            Expires January 1, 2014                [Page 64]

Internet-Draft       RTP Payload Format for HEVC           July 1, 2013


   that the packet loss rate is within an acceptable range.  Packet
   loss is considered acceptable if a TCP flow across the same network
   path, and experiencing the same network conditions, would achieve an
   average throughput, measured on a reasonable timescale, that is not
   less than the RTP flow is achieving.  This condition can be
   satisfied by implementing congestion control mechanisms to adapt the
   transmission rate, the number of layers subscribed for a layered
   multicast session, or by arranging for a receiver to leave the
   session if the loss rate is unacceptably high.

   The bitrate adaptation necessary for obeying the congestion control
   principle is easily achievable when real-time encoding is used, for
   example by adequately tuning the quantization parameter.

   However, when pre-encoded content is being transmitted, bandwidth
   adaptation requires the pre-coded bitstream to be tailored for such
   adaptivity.    The  key  mechanism  available  in  HEVC  is  temporal
   scalability.  A media sender can remove NAL units belonging to
   higher temporal sub-layers (i.e. those NAL units with a high value
   of TID) until the sending bitrate drops to an acceptable range.
   HEVC contains mechanisms that allow the lightweight identification
   of switching points in temporal enhancement layers, as discussed in
   Section 1.1.2 of this memo.  An HEVC media sender can send packets
   belonging to NAL units of temporal enhancement layers starting from
   these switching points to probe for available bandwidth and to
   utilized bandwidth that has been shown to be available.

   Above mechanisms generally work within a defined profile and level
   and, therefore, no renegotiation of the channel is required.  Only
   when non-downgradable parameters (such as profile) are required to
   be changed does it become necessary to terminate and restart the
   media stream.  This may be accomplished by using a different RTP
   payload type.

   MANEs MAY remove certain unusable packets from the packet stream
   when that stream was damaged due to previous packet losses.  This
   can help reduce the network load in certain special cases.  For
   example, MANES can remove those FUs where the leading FUs belonging
   to the same NAL unit have been lost or those dependent slice
   segments when the leading slice segments belonging to the same slice
   have been lost, because the trailing FUs or dependent slice segments

   are meaningless to most decoders.  MANES can also remove higher
   temporal scalable layers if the outbound transmission (from the
   MANE's viewpoint) experiences congestion.

11. IANA Consideration

   A new media type, as specified in Section 7.1 of this memo, should
   be registered with IANA.
