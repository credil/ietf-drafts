                  draft-fossati-core-publish-option-02

Abstract

   This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP).  This Option is used by a CoAP Endpoint to control
   the authority delegation of one of its resources to another Endpoint.
   All the phases of the authority delegation process (setup, renewal,
   cancellation) are controlled by a simple RESTful protocol.

   This memo also introduces the 'proxies' Web Linking relation type, to
   be used by a CoAP Proxy to explicitly advertise the resources that it
   can serve from its cache, or by forwarding the Client request
   upstream (either to the origin, or to another Proxy).

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application
   Protocol [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   The Publish Option is used by a sleepy Endpoint (SEP) to temporarily
   delegate the authority of one of its resources to another, always on,
   Endpoint.  The delegated Endpoint is typically a Proxy, though it
   could be an Endpoint with no other special network role.

   The SEP is given a simple RESTful messaging protocol that enables the
   setup, renewal and cancellation of the authority transfer.  The whole
   process is driven by the SEP, which may actually never need to listen
   or to keep any state.

Internet-Draft           Publish Option for CoAP            October 2013


   This memo also introduces the 'proxies' Web Linking [RFC5988]
   relation type.

   This new relation, which complements the default 'hosts' relation
   defined in [RFC6690], can be used by a CoAP Proxy to explicitly
   advertise the resources that it can serve either from cache or by
   forwarding the Client request upstream.

   The 'proxies' relation works in concert with the Publish Option to
   enable SEP discovery even while SEP is off-line.

1.1.  Requirements Language and Motivation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms Client, Proxy, Server, and Endpoint are to be interpreted
   as described in [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   This memo reuses the terminology introduced in
   [I-D.rahman-core-sleepy-problem-statement], and aims at meeting the
   objectives stated in its Section 4 via an entirely in-protocol
   solution.

2.  Publish Option

   The Publish Option enables a SEP to temporarily (i.e. for a specified
   "lease" time) delegate the authority of one of its hosted resources
   to another Endpoint.

      +------+---+---+---+---+---------+--------+--------+---------+
      |  No. | C | U | N | R | Name    | Format | Length | Default |
      +------+---+---+---+---+---------+--------+--------+---------+
      | 2n+1 | x | x | x | - | Publish | uint   | 1      | (none)  |
      +------+---+---+---+---+---------+--------+--------+---------+


2.1.  Publishing a Resource

   The SEP publishes one of its hosted resources, specified by the
   enclosed Proxy-URI, by making a PUT to the Proxy with a Publish
   Option attached.  The Publish Option value specifies the CoAP methods
   that Clients are allowed to use on the resource (see Section 2.4).

   The example in Figure 1 shows a delegation where the GET and PUT
   methods are allowed, while POST and DELETE are explicitly prohibited,
   meaning that the resource can only be read and updated by Clients.

   P         S
   |   PUT   | Proxy-URI: coap://sleepy.example.org/res
   |<--------+ Publish: 0x60
   |    r    | Content-Format: text/plain
   |         | ETag: 0xabcd
   |         | Max-Age: 1200
   |  2.01   |
   +-------->|
   |         |

                                 Figure 1

   The Proxy, which is voluntarily entrusted by the resource owner to
   act as the delegated origin for the "lease" time specified by Max-
   Age, replies with a 2.01 if the authority transfer succeeds.  An
   exact duplicate of the submitted representation is created, and from
   now on it can be accessed using the original URI provided that
   Clients request it through the delegated Proxy.  If the Publish
   operation isn't successful (e.g. because the Proxy does not support
   Publish), then the origin transfer fails, and an appropriate response
   code is returned (e.g. 4.02 Bad Option).

   An ETag MAY be supplied as a further metadatum to be included in
   responses involving the published representation.  If no Max-Age is
   given, a default of 3600 seconds MUST be assumed.  The Max-Age value,
   either implicit or explicit, determines the lifetime of the origin
   delegation.  When Max-Age is elapsed, the Proxy MUST delete the
   published resource value and fall back to its usual proxying
   function.

   The Publish Option is critical, and MUST NOT be present in a
   response.  If the Proxy does not recognize it, a 4.02 (Bad Option)
   MUST be returned to the Client.  If the Option value is not correctly
   formatted (see Section 2.4), a 4.00 (Bad Request) MUST be returned to
   the Client.  The Publish Option is not Safe-to-Forward, and neither
   is a Cache-Key.

   Since the 2.01 is emitted, and for the duration of the delegation,
   any Client wishing to access the resource can do so by making a
   Proxy-URI request to the Proxy, which shall then serve the resource
   off from its own storage.

   An interesting outcome of this communication strategy is that the SEP
   may really never need to listen on its radio interface.  However,
   ignoring the response status code from Proxy is not a safe practice
   and is not encouraged.

   Upon publishing, the Proxy MUST save the identity of the publishing
   SEP, and MUST use it to correctly authorise "maintenance" operations
   such as renewal or cancellation of the published resource.  The SEP
   identity MUST be kept for the whole duration of the delegation
   (including any associated renewal) and can be forgotten as soon as
   the delegation vanishes either implicitly or explicitly.

2.2.  Updating a Resource

   In order to update the delegated resource state or to just extend the
   lease period, the SEP shall send basically the same request (except
   possibly for the representation value and the associated ETag) to the
   Proxy, which in turn replies with a 2.04 Changed status code in case
   the update operation succeeds.  If the operation fails, e.g. because
   the request comes from an Endpoint different from the publishing SEP,
   a suitable status code is returned (e.g. 4.01 Unauthorized).

   P         S
   |   PUT   | Proxy-URI: coap://sleepy.example.org/res
   |<--------+ Publish: 0x60
   |    r    | Content-Format: text/plain
   |         | ETag: 0xdcba
   |         | Max-Age: 1200
   |  2.04   |
   +-------->|
   |         |

                                 Figure 2

2.3.  Unpublishing a Resource

   The delegation of a given resource can be explicitly revoked by the
   SEP at any time before the lease time expires, by issuing a DELETE
   request to the Proxy hosting the resource duplicate with a Publish
   Option with value 0x00.

   P          S
   |  DELETE  | Proxy-URI: coap://sleepy.example.org/res
   |<---------+ Publish: 0x00
   |          |
   |   2.02   |
   +--------->|
   |          |


   On successful deletion of the delegation, a 2.02 Deleted response
   code is returned by the Proxy.  On error a suitable status code is
   returned.

Internet-Draft           Publish Option for CoAP            October 2013


2.4.  Value Format

   The Publish Option consists of a single byte having the following
   layout:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |C R U D 0 0 0 0|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Each of the higher 4 bits is a flag field indicating whether the
   associated CoAP method (respectively: POST, GET, PUT and DELETE) is
   allowed on the published resource.  The lower 4 bits are reserved and
   MUST be set to 0.

   The 0x00 value is used to explicitly revoke the delegation (see
   Section 2.3.) and MUST NOT be used for any other purpose of the
   Option.

   If the delegated Proxy receives a request for the published resource
   with a method that is not compatible with the mask supplied by the
   SEP, it MUST respond with a 4.05 (Method Not Allowed) response code.

3.  Discovery

3.1.  The 'proxies' Relation Type

   The new 'proxies' Web Linking [RFC5988] relation type is meant to
   signify that the target resource carried by the link, which MUST be
   identified by an absolute URI, is reachable through a Proxy-URI
   request made to the anchored Origin (i.e. the Proxy).

   (Note that we need to specify the Proxy through an explicit anchor,
   thus increasing the verbosity of the link value, because of the way
   the context URI override rules are defined in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC6690].  In fact, absent an explicit anchor, rule (b) would set
   the context to the SEP origin, which is definitely not what we want.)

3.1.1.  Examples

   o  C discovers resources that P "proxies":

   P         C
   |   GET   | Uri-Path: .well-known
   |<--------+ Uri-Path: core
   |         | Uri-Query: rel="proxies"
   |  2.05   |



Fossati, et al.          Expires April 23, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Publish Option for CoAP            October 2013


   +-------->| <coap://sleepy.example.org/res>;
   |         |     anchor="coap://proxy.example.org/";
   |         |     rel="proxies",
   |         | <...


   o  C GET's a "proxied" resource from P:

   P         C
   |   GET   |
   |<--------+ Proxy-URI: coap://sleepy.example.org/res
   |         |
   |  2.05   |
   +-------->| "res" data...
   |         |


   The 'proxies' relation is orthogonal to the Publish Option, so it's
   up to P to decide whether to serve coap://sleepy.example.org/res from
   its store/cache, or to forward the request to the origin at coap://
   sleepy.example.org.

3.2.  Adjusting Link-Format Attributes

3.2.1.  Implicitly

   The resource metadata are implicitly extracted from the published
   representation.  Basically, the Proxy works out the ct and sz
   attributes by inspecting Content-Format and the request payload size.

3.2.2.  Explicitly

   The resource metadata are explicitly published to the same Proxy-URI
   used for the sibling resource, either in a separate request/response
   cycle (see Figure 3),

   P         S
   |   PUT   | Proxy-URI: coap://sleepy.example.org/res
   |<--------+ Publish: 0x60
   |  <meta> | Content-Format: application/link-format
   |         |
   |  2.01   |
   +-------->|
   |         |

   or atomically, within the same Publish operation, e.g. by using the
   Multipart Content-Format to aggregate one (or even more than one)
   representation(s) together with the application/link-format entry
   (see Figure 4).

   P         S
   |   PUT   | Proxy-URI: coap://sleepy.example.org/res
   |<--------+ Publish: 0x60
   |  [mp]   | Content-Format: application/multipart+publish
   |         | ETag: 0xabcd
   |         | Max-Age: 1200
   |  2.01   |
   +-------->|
   |         |

                                 Figure 4

   Note that the former (Figure 3) is non-atomic, and limited to only
   one representation of the resource; the latter (Figure 4) is atomic
   and supports multiple Content-Format's for the published resource.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The following entries are added to the CoAP Option Numbers registry:

                     .------------------------------.
                     | Number | Name    | Reference |

                     |  2n+1  | Publish | RFC XXXX  |
                     `------------------------------'


   This memo registers the new "proxies" Web Linking relation type as
   per [RFC5988].

      Relation Name: proxies

      Description: the target is the absolute URI of a resource proxied
      by the Origin stated in the anchor.

      Reference: this memo

      Notes: This relation is used in CoRE where links are retrieved as
      a "/.well-known/core" resource representation.

      Application Data: None

6.  Security Considerations

   This section identifies Threats (T) and related countermeasures (C).

   o  T: cache poisoning.
   o  C: use strong auth to identify SEP.

   o  T: unauthorized update or de-registration
   o  C: strong auth to identify SEP.

   o  T: Proxy resources' exhaustion.
   o  C: use strong auth to identify SEP + quota limit.

   o  T: lobal state loss.
   o  C: cache redundancy.

   o  T: Inject fake copies of the resource by a 3rd party.
   o  C: use delegation scheme that bundles the identities of the SEP
      and the Proxy, together with the resource being delegated.  A
      third party must be able to verify SEP and Proxy identities, maybe
      offline, and check the resource fingerprint.

6.1.  Securing the Delegation

   (Sketch) SEP signs the identity of the delegated Proxy and a
   fingerprint of the resource (both data and meta), and bundles it up
   with the resource itself, maybe in a MultiPart envelope (TBD define
   signed Content-Format).  Client verifies the resource is indeed from
   the SEP by checking the signature, and it has been served by the
   intended origin, within the validity frame of the delegation.  There
   seems to be an issue with hierarchical caching: the resource can't be
   served from a downstream Proxy which is different from the one that
   was originally delegated unless each Proxy in the delivery chain
   wraps the received message with its own credentials?
