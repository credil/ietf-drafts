Internet-Draft        IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes            July 2013


   RFC 4291 [RFC4291] defines "scop is a 4-bit multicast scope value
   used to limit the scope of the multicast group." scop 3 is defined as
   "reserved" in RFC 4291.  The multicast protocol specification in
   draft-ietf-roll-trickle-mcast [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast] desires
   to use multicast scop 3 for transport of multicast traffic scoped to
   a RPL realm (or "domain") [RFC6550].  The use of this scop value is
   to accommodate a multicast scope that is greater than Link-Local but
   is also automatically determined by the network architecture; for
   example, all of the hosts and routers in a multi-link subnet RPL
   realm.

   The following table updates the definitions in RFC 4291:

   0  reserved

   1  Interface-Local scope

   2  Link-Local scope

   3  Realm-Local scope

   4  Admin-Local scope

   5  Site-Local scope

   6  (unassigned)

   7  (unassigned)

   8  Organization-Local scope

   9  (unassigned)

   A  (unassigned)

   B  (unassigned)

   C  (unassigned)

   D  (unassigned)

   E  Global scope

   F  reserved

   The following paragraph is added as the third paragraph following the
   list of scop values in RFC 4291:

         Realm-Local scope is the largest scope that is automatically
         configured, i.e., automatically derived from physical
         connectivity or other, non-multicast-related configuration.



2.  Definition of Realm-Local scopes

   The definition of any Realm-Local scope for a particular network
   technology should be published in an RFC.  For example, such a scope
   definition would be appropriate for publication in an "IPv6-over-foo"
   RFC.

   Any RFCs that include the definition of a Realm-Local scope will be
   listed in the IANA "IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes" registry.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to establish a sub-registry titled "IPv6 Multicast
   Address Scopes" in the existing "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
   Multicast Address Allocations" registry.  The "IPv6 Multicast Address
   Scopes" is to be populated with the scope values given in section 1,
   with a note associated with scope 3 listing all RFCs that define
   Realm-Local scoping rules that use scope 3.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations beyond those in RFC 4291
   [RFC4291].
