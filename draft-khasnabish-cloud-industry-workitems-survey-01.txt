1.  Introduction

   This draft presents a survey of the industry work items related to
   cloud activities.  By conducting a comprehensive survey, work items
   in cloud standards can be determined.  This will allow us to
   determine the IETF work that would be required to address the work
   items.  Once these IETF work have been completed, seamless
   interoperability of cloud services can be realized.

2.  Terminology

   Cloud-based systems are conveniently-connected modular blocks of
   resources

   o  Both physical and virtual modularizations of resources are
      possible

   o  For this discussion, the resources include computing (CPU),
      communications (network), memory, storage, management, database,
      software, applications, services, interconnectivity, etc.

   o  The objective is to make the resources available ubiquitously for
      mission-specific applications and services.  These resources are
      used to support the ultimate level of privacy/security,
      scalability and reliability cost-effectively and without the
      headache of owning and maintaining the infrastructure.

   Service over Cloud

   o  Utilize (stitch, weave, embroider, ...) the resources from Cloud
      to provision, create, deliver, and maintain an End-to-End Service

   o  Use the service only when you Need it

   o  Pay only for the time duration and type of use of service (incl.
      the costs for resources used)

3.  Work Items Explanation

   WorkItem A: Cloud Client-side API.

   o  Cloud Client-side API is the interface that is used to execute
      assigned functions (such as login, get data, post change) at
      client-side.  In cloud environment, some clients need invoke the
      API to process the returned results or to handle commands (such as
      monitoring or logging request) from the server.

   o  Cloud Client-side API can also be utilized by users and 3-party
      developers before accessing resources of the Cloud Computing
      Platforms, such as making resource requests to the server.

   o  It is required to avoid the use of proprietary API in order to
      support the interoperability.

   WorkItem B: Cloud Server-side API.

   o  Cloud Server-side API is the interface that allows developers to
      build their own unique solutions on top of Cloud Computing
      Platform, to access the capabilities of the platform.

   o  In cloud enviroment, the API can be used to authenticate &
      authorize login request, check resource status, allocate requisite
      resources, configure virtual machines, etc.

   o  It is required to avoid the use of proprietary API in order to
      support the interoperability.

   WorkItem C: Clouds OS layer (what are added to the VM layer to hide
   the complexity)

   o  Clouds OS layer refers to an Operating System (OS) or Hypervisor
      and Virtual Machines (VM) that resides above the physical resource
      layer to manage the physical resources.

   o  In OS-level virtualization, the kernel of an operating system
      allows for multiple isolated user-space instances, instead of just
      one.  In addition to isolation mechanisms, the kernel often
      provides resource management features to limit the impact of one
      instance's activities on the other instances.  In order to realize
      the above features, sometimes, the OS needs to be modified.
      Currently there are many virtualization technologies.

      *  Full virtualization: In full virtualization, the virtual
         machine simulates enough hardware to allow an unmodified
         "guest" OS to be run in isolation.



Khasnabish, et al.       Expires January 2, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   Cloud Industry Workitem Survey Results        July 2011


      *  Hardware-assisted virtualization: In hardware-assisted
         virtualization, the hardware provides architectural support
         that facilitates building a virtual machine monitor and allows
         guest OSes to be run in isolation.

      *  Partial virtualization: In partial virtualization, including
         address space virtualization, the virtual machine simulates
         multiple instances of much of an underlying hardware
         environment, particularly address spaces.

      *  Paravirtualization: In paravirtualization, the virtual machine
         does not necessarily simulate hardware, but instead (or in
         addition) offers a special API that can only be used by
         modifying the "guest" OS.

      *  Operating system-level virtualization: In operating system-
         level virtualization, a physical server is virtualized at the
         operating system level, enabling multiple isolated and secure
         virtualized servers to run on a single physical server.  The
         "guest" OS environments share the same OS as the host system.

   o  It is required to investigate what needs to be added to the VM
      layer in order to hide the complexity of the cloud systems.

   WorkItem D: Cloud Service and Resources Logging, Auditing, and
   Reporting

   o  Cloud Services are business or consumer products, services and
      solutions that are delivered in cloud computing enviroment.  Three
      types of services have gained popularity, and each of them
      addresses the standard definitions of cloud computing in their own
      way.

      *  IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service: The concept of IaaS is to
         provide the infrastructure to application's need, as a service.
         You will usually pay an hourly or monthly fee for the
         infrastructure you choose to use.

      *  PaaS - Platform as a Service: PaaS provides platform
         environment that is required to run an application.  All you
         need to care about is the application itself and the model you
         describe that tells the vendor how the application should be
         run.

      *  SaaS - Software as a Service: SaaS sometimes referred to as
         "on-demand software", is a software delivery model in which
         software and its associated data are hosted centrally and are
         typically accessed by users using a thin client, normally using

         a web browser over the Internet.

   o  Cloud Logging, Auditing, and Reporting are methods used to trace
      cloud service, resource activities and status.

      *  Cloud logging means that an open and extensible log format to
         be used by any cloud entity or cloud application to log and
         trace users or system activities that occur in the cloud.

      *  Auditing and Reporting means that specific information can be
         got from the Cloud system for diagnosis fault or analysis
         system behavior.

   WorkItem E: Cloud Service Performance and Security Monitoring and
   Reporting

   o  Cloud Service Performance moinitoring means the ability to monitor
      the Quality of Services (QoS) services delivered over virtualized
      systems.  In order to guarantee the service performance, such
      methods as resource scheduling, load balancing, simplicity system
      configuring and application loading, and performance monitoring
      need to be undertaken.

   o  Cloud Security Monitoring and Reporting aims to provide
      interactive information and automated reports on resource
      utilization, including real-time monitoring of services/
      applications user accounts, files, access, intrusions, etc.

   o  The cloud security monitoring and reporting process helps
      decision-makers and managers determine and understand the security
      risks.  Monitoring the system periodically and instantly helps
      determine potential problems in early stages and can be used to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the security control mechanisms.

   WorkItem F: Cloud Resources Definition and Description

   o  Cloud Resources Definition and Description is the mechanism that
      can be used as a general method for conceptual description or
      modeling of information that is implemented in virtualized
      resources, using a variety of syntax formats.

   o  Different types of virtualization platforms use different
      definitions of resources.  For each kind of resources, there may
      be different types of attributes.

   WorkItem G: Cloud Resources and VM Mobility across different
   techonology domains.




Khasnabish, et al.       Expires January 2, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   Cloud Industry Workitem Survey Results        July 2011


   o  There are many reasons that require the cloud platform supports VM
      mobility across clouds, such as load balancing, SLA requirements,
      avoiding service interruption, etc.  VM mobility can be divided
      into 'cold' mobility which will interrupt the services/sessions in
      progress, and 'hot' mobility which will not interrupt the ongoing
      services/sessions.  The resources need to be reserved in advance
      on the target cloud domain during migration of the VM.

   WorkItem H: Multi-Domain Distributed Scaling and Filing of
   Information / Resources

   o  Multi-Domain Distributed Scaling means that the services are
      distributed among multiple domains and can be scaled on on-demand
      basis.  The information/resources (such as billing, logging
      record) are filed among multiple domains in the cloud.

   WorkItem I: Provisioning of advanced services (voice, video,
   streaming media, gaming, etc.) over a variety of cloud domains.

   o  This workitem is to investigate whether the cloud has the
      capability to support the delivery of advanced services over a
      variety of cloud domains.  The applications are deployed over
      clouds based on service provider's requirements, such as ensuring
      service rubust, load balancing, service provision exceeding cloud
      coverage, etc.  The cloud which manages the advanced services over
      other clouds (for example Service Management Cloud) is responsible
      for the lifecycle of advanced services, and the cloud which is
      selcted by the Service Management Cloud to deploy advanced
      services (for example Service Deployment Cloud) is responsible for
      resource allocation and service maintenance.

   WorkItem J: Support and maintenance of advanced services over a
   variety of Clouds

   o  This workitem is to investigate whether the Cloud (as role of
      Service Deployment Cloud) can provide support and maintenance of
      advanced services deployed by other Service Management Cloud.

   WorkItem K: Address resolution and extension (e.g., VPN extension to
   private Clouds)

   o  ARP extension provides a scalable address resolution protocol to
      map virtual host's identity to physical IP/MAC addresses in order
      to solve client routing among multiple subnetworks.

   o  Service providers also have the requirements to support cloud
      services interworking with the existing MPLS-based L2/L3 VPN
      services.  It is required to maintain separation of the enterprise

      traffic, and customer data, and queries.

   WorkItem L: Risk, Resiliency, and SLA (RRS): Risk-tolerance, MTTF,
   MTTR, etc. for cloud components and Apps/Services (on an end-to-end
   basis)

   o  This workitem is related to ensuring long-term sustainability of
      the application/service in cloud system.  This includes risk-
      tolerance, disaster recovery, and SLA maintenance of the system.
      The measuring methods as MTTF and MTTR need to be considered.

   WorkItem M: Seamless support of Multi-tenancy (domestic/International
   customers)

   o  In a multi-tenant environment, multiple customers share the same
      resources with applications running on the same operating system,
      on the same hardware, with the same data-storage mechanism.
      Therefore it is required to satisfy different requirements of the
      customers such as security, data model, access control, workflow,
      etc.

   o  This workitem is to investigate whether multi-tenancy can be
      seamlessly supported.  Because of the additional customization
      complexity, and the need to maintain per-tenant metadata, multi-
      tenancy applications may require a different development effort.

5.  Standardization Consideration

5.1.  WorkItem A: Cloud Client-side API

   In Virtual Desktop Infrastucture (VDI) technology, the interaction
   between the client device and the hosted server needs standardized,
   that is, the Client-Side API needs to be specified.

5.2.  WorkItem B: Cloud Server-side API

   There are many cloud resource management APIs currently in effect,
   such as AWS EC2, GoGrid, Rackspace and Sun Cloud.  They use different
   protocols (such as SOAP, WS-*, REST, plain HTTP) and are applied in
   different scenarios.

   In IETF, we need converge resources provided by different platforms,
   and also provide unified interface among resouce client, resource
   manager and resource provider.  So, it is necessary to standardize
   the Cloud Server-Side API to simplify system management.

   The results of initial work in this area can be found in [VRM].

5.3.  WorkItem C: Clouds OS layer

   Cloud resource management is based on the virutal resource platforms
   provided by different vendors, converges the different kinds of
   virtual resources as a whole and provides resource management and
   control functions according to applications/services requirements.

   The cloud work in IETF does not touch the implementation of the
   virtual resource layer, so it is not necessary to standardize the
   Cloud OS layer.  But if a virtualization platform provides resource
   to the cloud, it'll support the unified interface.

5.4.  WorkItem D: Cloud Service and Resources Logging, Auditing, and
      Reporting

   An open and extensible logging/auditing format needs to be specified
   for use by any cloud entity or cloud application to log and trace
   activities that occur in the cloud.  It is equally applicable for
   cloud infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS)
   services.

   Standardized Log format is required for auditing and verification
   purposes which are important parts of management and operations.

   The results of initial work in this area can be found in [Cloud Log],
   [VOCS], and [CSB].

Internet-Draft   Cloud Industry Workitem Survey Results        July 2011


5.5.  WorkItem E: Cloud Service Performance and Security Monitoring and
      Reporting

   Standards of Cloud Security Framework (CSF) are needed for the Cloud
   Service Providers (CSP), which would enable CSP organizations and
   development organizations using their service to practice safe
   security techniques for their applications and intra & inter CSP
   information exchange.

5.6.  WorkItem F: Cloud Resources Definition and Description

   In current Cloud and Virutal Data Centre (VDC) environment, the
   manageable virtualized resources are supplied by different vendor's
   hypervisors (such as VMware ESX/ESXi, Citrix Xen Server, Oracle VM,
   Microsoft Hyper-V, etc.).  The Resource Management Platform (RMP)
   need support variety of proprietary or open APIs provided by
   hypervisor vendors to access, manage and integrate the exposed
   different types of resources.  In order to decouple RMP from any
   particular hypervisor, a unified cloud resource model is needed to
   define and describe the resources the platform converged.

   o  Applications/Services running on a hypervisor may gain better
      support or performance by running on the other different one.

   o  The existing hypervisor can't satisfy the needed features or
      functions, such as disaster recovery, business continuity,
      security, reporting, etc.

   o  New system requirements or virtual machine demands would be served
      more effectively or cheaper on a different hypervisor.

   o  Elimination of hypervisor vendor lock-in and avoidance of service
      unavailability when fail to upgrade or patch some same type of
      hypervisor the service deployed on.

   o  Multiple choices can be offered to service providers or customers
      to select their preferred platforms.

   With multiple hypervisors providing resources to the cloud, it is
   difficult for Cloud RMP to manage and coordinate these resources.

   o  Different hypervisors provide different VRM APIs and use different
      transport protocols.

   o  Different virtualization platforms provide different views of
      hierarchical resources.





Khasnabish, et al.       Expires January 2, 2012               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft   Cloud Industry Workitem Survey Results        July 2011


   o  Different hypervisors have different ways to describe resource
      attributes.

   When the cloud RMP consists of resources provided by multiple
   vendor's hypervisors, it need support different kinds of APIs with
   their transport protocols utilized by different vendors hypervisors.
   Moreover, when a new hypervisor appears or existing hypervisor
   upgrades, the cloud RMP need change accordingly to adapt the varies.
   It'll complicate the implementation of the cloud RMP.

   To solve these problems and simplify operations on the virtual
   resource management, the following two requirements must be met.

   o  The API needs to be hypervisor-agnostic.  It can be leveraged by
      cloud RMP to form a unified resource pool.

   o  The API needs to be simple and lightweight.  It can be implemented
      with the popular technologies, such as HTTP, URI, XML, JSON, etc.

   The results of initial work in this area can be found in [VRM] and
   [VNet Model].

5.7.  WorkItem G: Cloud Resources and VM Mobility across Private-
      Private, Private-Public, etc.

   Virtual switches on server virtualization platforms cause a problem
   in managing data center networks containing several hundred switches.
   Accordingly, a standardized management information model for the
   network structure of data center networks containing virtual switches
   is needed.

   The results of initial work in this area can be found in [Cloud
   Service Mobility] and [Cloud Workload Mobility].

5.8.  WorkItem H: Multi-Domain Distributed Scaling and Filing of
      Information/Resources

   Current there is no draft available to address this work item.

5.9.  WorkItem I: Provisioning of advanced services over a variety of
      Clouds

   Cloud Service Broker (CSB) entity provides brokering service between
   different Cloud Service Providers.  Operations and management aspects
   of brokering need to be discussed and standardized.
