                   Indicating Fax over IP Capability
                in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                 draft-hanes-dispatch-fax-capability-04

Abstract

   This document defines and registers with IANA the new 'fax' media
   feature tag for use with SIP.  Currently, fax calls are
   indistinguishable from voice at call initiation.  Consequently, fax
   calls can be routed to SIP user agents that are not fax capable.  A
   'fax' media feature tag implemented in conjunction with RFC 3841
   [RFC3841] allows for more accurate fax call routing.

Internet-Draft            Fax Media Feature Tag             October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Fax communications in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) are
   handled in a "voice first" manner.  Indications that a user desires
   to use a fax transport protocol, such as ITU-T T.38 [T38], to send a
   fax are not known when the initial INVITE message is sent.  The call
   is set up as a voice call first and then only after it is connected,
   does a switchover to the T.38 [T38] protocol occur.  This is
   problematic in that fax calls can be routed inadvertently to SIP user
   agents that are not fax capable.

   To ensure that fax calls are routed to fax capable SIP user agents,
   an implementation of caller preferences defined in RFC 3841 [RFC3841]
   is necessary.  Feature preferences are a part of RFC 3841 [RFC3841]
   that would allow UAs to express their preference for receiving fax
   communications.  Subsequently SIP servers take these preferences into
   account to increase the likelihood that fax calls land at fax capable
   SIP user agents.

   This document defines the 'fax' media feature tag for use in the SIP
   tree as per Section 12.1 of RFC 3840 [RFC3840].  This feature tag
   will be applied per RFC 3841 [RFC3841] as a feature preference for
   fax capable UAs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Motivation

   In the majority of circumstances, it is preferred that capabilities
   be handled in the SDP portion of the SIP communication.  However, fax
   is somewhat unique in that the ultimate intention of the call is not
   accurately signaled in the initial SDP exchange.  Fax is one of the
   few situations where a media feature tag indicating a capability is
   highly predictive of the ultimate communication request that will be
   made in the near future but is not indicated by the current SDP.

   Specifically, indications of T.38 [T38] or any other fax transport
   protocol in the call are not known when the call is initiated by an
   INVITE message.  Fax calls are always considered voice calls until
   after they are connected.  This results in increased chances of fax
   calls being received by SIP user agents not capable of handling fax
   transmissions.

Internet-Draft            Fax Media Feature Tag             October 2012


   For example, Alice wants to send a fax to Bob. Bob registers two SIP
   UAs.  The first SIP UA is not fax capable but the second one supports
   the T.38 [T38] fax protocol.  Currently, SIP servers are unable to
   know when the call starts that Alice prefers a fax capable SIP UA to
   handle her call.  Additionally, the SIP servers are also not aware of
   which of Bob's SIP UAs are fax capable.

   An implementation of RFC3841 [RFC3841] changes this scenario and
   feature preferences are used to resolve this issue.  With RFC 3841
   [RFC3841], Alice can express up front that she prefers a T.38 [T38]
   fax capable SIP UA for this call.  At the same time, Bob's SIP UAs
   have expressed their fax capabilities as well during registration.
   Now when Alice places a fax call to Bob, the call is appropriately
   routed to Bob's fax capable SIP UA.


4.  Example

   Bob registers with the fax media feature tag.  The message flow is
   shown in FFigure 1:

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations related to the use of media feature tags
   from Section 11.1 of RFC 3840 [RFC3840] apply.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification adds a new media feature tag to the SIP Media
   Feature Tag Registration Tree per the procedures defined in RFC 2506
   [RFC2506] and RFC 3840 [RFC3840].

   Media feature tag name:  sip.fax

   ASN.1 Identifier:  1.3.6.1.8.4.{PH}

Internet-Draft            Fax Media Feature Tag             October 2012


   Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag:  This feature tag
      indicates whether a communications device supports the ITU-T T.38
      [T38] fax protocol ("t38") or the passthrough method of fax
      transmission using the ITU-T G.711 [G711] audio codec
      ("passthrough").

   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:  Token with an
      equality relationship.  Values are:

      t38:  The device supports the image/t38 media type [RFC3326] and
         implements ITU-T T.38 [T38] for transporting the ITU-T T.30
         [T30] and ITU-T T.4 [T4] fax data over IP.

      passthrough:  The device supports the audio/pcmu and audio/pcma
         media types [RFC4856] for transporting ITU-T T.30 [T30] and
         ITU-T T.4 [T4] fax data using the ITU-T G.711 [G711] audio
         codec.  Additional implementation recommendations are in ITU-T
         V.152 [V152] Sections 6 and 6.1.

   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
   applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:   This
      feature tag is most useful in a communications application for the
      early identification of a FoIP call.

   Examples of typical use:  Ensuring a fax call is routed to a fax
      capable SIP UA.

   Related standards or documents:  RFCXXXX

   Security Considerations:  Security considerations for this media
      feature tag are discussed in Section 5 of this document.

   [[NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please change {PH} above to the correct
   identifier for this entry in the IANA registry for
   iso.org.dod.internet.features.sip-tree (1.3.6.1.8.4)]]

   [[NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please change XXXX to the number assigned to
   this specification, and remove this paragraph on publication.]]
