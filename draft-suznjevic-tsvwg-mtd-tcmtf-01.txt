                  Compressed Multiplexed Traffic Flows
                   draft-suznjevic-tsvwg-mtd-tcmtf-01

Abstract

   This document contains recommendations to be taken into account when
   using methods which optimize bandwidth utilization through
   compression, multiplexing, and tunneling traffic flows (TCMTF) over a
   network path.  Different multiplexing policies and implementation
   issues which are service and link specific are discussed.
   Additionally, this document describes policies which can be used for
   detecting, classifying, and choosing the network flows suitable for
   optimization by using TCMTF.  Finally, recommendations of maximum
   tolerable delays to be added by optimization techniques are reported.
   Recommendations are presented only for network services for which
   such bandwidth optimization techniques are applicable (i.e., services
   with low payload to header size ratio, which will also be denoted as
   "small-packet flows").

1.  Introduction

   This document extends the draft [TCMTF] with a set of recommendations
   regarding the processes of compression, multiplexing, and tunneling.
   These recommendations are needed because the techniques proposed in
   [TCMTF], while saving bandwidth, may cause network impairments.
   Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the
   Quality of Experience (QoE) of real-time network services RFC 6390
   [RFC6390] [TGPP_TR26.944].  In order to prevent the perceived quality
   degradation of the services when using TCMTF, a policy defining a
   multiplexing period can be employed.

   First, the document describes different multiplexing policies which
   can be employed for defining which native packets are multiplexed

   together.  A policy combining a multiplexing period and a packet size
   limit is proposed in order to put an upper bound on the added delay.

   Additionally, this document describes the policies that can be
   employed for detecting, classifying, and choosing the network flows
   suitable for TCMTF optimization.

   Finally, values for maximum tolerable delays presented here from the
   base of the proposed multiplexing policy.  The recommendations are
   presented for both real-time and non real-time network services in
   which TCMTF bandwidth optimization is applicable (i.e., services
   which have low payload-to-header-size ratio, which results in high
   protocol overhead, which will also be denoted as small-packet flows).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses a number of terms to refer to the roles played by
   participants in, and objects of, the TCMTF sessions.

   multiplexer

   The host where TCMTF optimization is deployed.  It corresponds to the
   ingress of the tunnel where native packets are included.

   demultiplexer

   The host where TCMTF multiplexed packets are received and rebuilt to
   their native form.  It corresponds to the tunnel egress.

   policy manager

   A network entity which makes the decisions about TCMTF parameters:
   multiplexing period; flows to be multiplexed together, depending on
   their IP addresses, ports, etc.  It is connected with a number of
   TCMTF multiplexers and demultiplexers, and orchestrates the
   optimization that takes place between them.

   native packet

   A packet sent by an application, belonging to a flow that can be
   optimized by means of TCMTF.

   multiplexed packet

   A packet including a number of multiplexed and header-compressed
   native ones, and also a tunneling header shared by all the packets,
   as detailed by TCMTF.

3.  Considered services

   The services considered suitable for being optimized by TCMTF are
   those that generate long-term flows of small packets, with a low
   payload to header size ratio.  Some real-time and some non real-time
   services are suitable for optimization by means of TCMTF.

3.1.  Real-time services

   Under the term "real-time network services" we consider both
   conversational and streaming service classes as defined in [TGPP_TS].
   Interactive and background services are considered non real-time.
   Fundamental requirements of real-time network services include
   conversational pattern (stringent and low delay) and preservation of
   the time relation (variation) between the information entities of the
   stream.

   We identify the following real-time network services with low payload
   to header size ratio as candidates for the bandwidth optimization
   techniques presented in TCMTF:

   o  Voice over IP

   o  Online games

   o  Remote desktop services

   While video services are considered real-time, they are not suitable
   for bandwidth optimization techniques proposed in [TCMTF], due to
   their high payload to header size ratio.  Due to the same reason, we
   do not take into account cloud gaming services.  In such gaming
   services all the calculations of the game state are deployed at the
   server and a real-time video stream is sent to the client.  In these
   cases, TCMTF optimization is neither interesting nor applicable.

3.2.  Non real-time services

   On the other hand, TCMTF can be applied for some non real-time
   services such as streaming audio, web browsing, and instant
   messaging.  These applications are suitable for TCMTF in terms of
   payload to header size ratio, but different studies have shown that
   acceptable delays for these services are up to several seconds



Suznjevic & Saldana     Expires December 16, 2013               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Delay Limits and Policies for TCMTF         June 2013


   [ITU-T_G.1010].  Also, some types of machine to machine (M2M) traffic
   (e.g., metering messages from various sensors) may have traffic
   properties suitable for TCMTF.  Acceptable delays for these services
   can be go up to an hour [Liu_M2M].  We list limitations for these
   services as well, although in the practical application TCMTF should
   not introduce delays which would be noticeable in comparison with
   delays of such magnitude (i.e., seconds and more).

4.  Multiplexing policies in TCMTF

   A multiplexing policy defines the decision process for determining
   which native packet goes in which multiplexed packet.  The policies
   proposed for TCMTF are:

   o  Fixed number of packets - once a fixed number of packets (N) has
      arrived, a multiplexed packet is created and sent.

   o  Size limit - once a size limit is reached (e.g., next to the MTU
      of the underlying network), a multiplexed packet is sent.

   o  Period - a multiplexed packet is sent every time period T.

   o  Timeout - sends a multiplexed packet if a native one arrives and
      the time since the last multiplexed packet departure is above a
      defined timeout value.

   Only the two latter policies are able to control the additional delay
   introduced by multiplexing.  In addition, different policies can be
   combined.

   In this document we focus on the combination of "size limit" and
   "period" policies, as shown in Figure 1.  A multiplexed packet is
   sent at the end of each "period".  However, if the size limit is
   reached, then a multiplexed packet is sent immediately, and the
   period is "reset".  Thus, the added delay is for the worst case
   scenario equal to the defined period.

        native traffic:

         |<--P-->|<--P-->|<--P-->|<--P-->|<-t*->|<--P-->|
         |       |       |       |       |      |       |
         |#   #  | #  #  |       |   #  #|######| #    #|
        -------------------------------------------------------> t

        multiplexed traffic:

         |       |       |       |       |      |       |
         |       |#      |#      |       |#     |##     |#
         |       |#      |#      |       |#     |##     |#
        -------------------------------------------------------> t

        * period reset (t<P) because size limit is reached

                Combined "period" and "size limit" policies

                                 Figure 1

   It should be noted that the number of aggregated flows and their
   packet rate will have an influence on the average multiplexing delay
   added.  If the number of flows is high, then the MTU size will be
   reached before the end of the period in most cases, so the additional
   delay will be smaller than the period.  The recommendations presented
   in this document present the maximum period values to be used as a
   limit, in order to avoid delays which could impair the quality of the
   service.

5.  Detecting, classifying, and choosing network flows to be optimized

   Three basic issues need to be solved in order to employ TCMTF
   optimization.  First, the flows which are candidates for optimization
   need to be detected from the overall traffic mix.  Secondly, the
   flows need to be classified into one of the defined categories so an
   adequate multiplexing period can be assigned.  Finally, the decision
   whether a specific flow will be optimized or not using TCMTF needs to
   be made.

5.1.  Optimization within an administrative domain

   Several scenarios can be considered for the use of TCMTF.  If the
   optimization is deployed within an administrative domain, then all
   the data of the end hosts, the service class, etc., are known by the
   multiplexer and the demultiplexer.

   Two examples of this are 1) the end-to-end optimization and
   aggregation of a number of flows between two offices of the same



Suznjevic & Saldana     Expires December 16, 2013               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Delay Limits and Policies for TCMTF         June 2013


   company and 2) the agreement between a network operator and a game
   provider in order to multiplex all the packets generated in an
   aggregation network with destination on a game server.  In these
   cases, the detection and classification of the desired flows will be
   straightforward, since the multiplexer can simply inspect the
   destination IP address and port, and apply the traffic category
   according to the kind of service.

5.2.  Optimization based on statistics

   If the optimization is not performed within an administrative domain,
   then the detection and classification of the flows, and the decision
   about multiplexing them, will have to be based on statistics of the
   traffic and heuristics.  The intelligence of the flow identification
   method can be improved according to the statistics of already
   classified flows.  E.g., if a number of small-packet flows sharing
   the same IP destination address are found, then this destination host
   can be classified as a frequent receiver of small-packet flows, and a
   tunnel including all the packets addressed to it can be set within a
   common network path.

   In addition, statistics can be enriched by the assignment of the
   traffic class, taking into account that some services, in addition to
   well-known ports, also have well-known IP addresses.  E.g., the
   traffic travelling to the IP address of a popular online game server,
   can be associated with the proper traffic class; or the ports
   corresponding to certain services can also be identified and used in
   order to improve the classification.

   The detection of the flows candidates for TCMTF optimization should
   be done based on flow characteristics, primarily on the packet
   payload to header ratio and on the packet rate.  As these properties
   cannot be established from statistics of just one packet, it is
   needed to gather a certain number of packets for each new flow
   arriving at the TCMTF multiplexer, and to use some heuristics in
   order to decide whether to multiplex a certain flow or not.

   The classification method employed for the TCMTF needs to identify
   only the flows which are candidates for the TCMTF optimization.
   Therefore, the classification problem is significantly simplified by
   removal of peer to peer (P2P) downloading applications, video
   streaming, data transfer, and all other services which in general,
   utilize large packets.  This is especially important as P2P
   applications are known to use various non assigned ports which may
   greatly ruin the performance of simple traffic classification
   methods.  For the purposes of TCMTF optimization there is no need to
   identify a particular application, only the delay sensitive class in
   which that application falls.  Also, the traffic classification



Suznjevic & Saldana     Expires December 16, 2013               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Delay Limits and Policies for TCMTF         June 2013


   methods employed by TCMTF need to be able to assign flows to
   respective delay sensitive classes in real time.  Current network
   traffic classification methods can be grouped into [Nguyen_TCSurvey]:

   o  Port based - through lookup of port numbers of endpoints in the
      Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)'s list of registered
      ports.

   o  Payload based - through stateful reconstruction of session and
      application information from each packet's content.

   o  Statistical - through comparison of the statistical properties of
      the traffic at the network layer.

   While payload inspection does give the best results, and is often
   used as ground truth in classification of network traffic, it is
   demanding computation wise.  Also, these techniques may be
   interpreted as a violation of privacy.  For the purposes of TCMTF we
   recommend using a combination of port based classification (which can
   yield very good results for games based on a client-server
   architecture and remote desktop services), and inspection of
   statistical properties of the flows.  One such algorithm has been
   employed for classification of different types of game flows and
   showed good results [Han_GameClassification].  TCMTF should use
   metadata information regarding the traffic class of particular flow
   where such information is available as that significantly simplifies
   the detection and classification problem.

   The decision whether the flow should be optimized with TCMTF can be
   made based on the following policies (configurations of the
   multiplexing node):

   o  A static configuration - predefined rule set for each new
      occurring flow, so the multiplexer makes a decision.

   o  A policy manager which dynamically enforces the rule set.

   o  The multiplexer demands instructions for each new flow from the
      policy manager.

6.  Delay recommendations

   The three normally considered network impairments in the studies
   related to subjective quality in real-time interactive games are:

   o  delay - can be reported as one-way-delay (OWD) [RFC2679] and two-
      way-delay (Round Trip Time) [RFC2681].  In this document, under
      the term latency, one way end-to-end delay is considered.



Suznjevic & Saldana     Expires December 16, 2013               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Delay Limits and Policies for TCMTF         June 2013


   o  delay variation - which is a statistical variance of the data
      packet inter-arrival time, in other words the variation of the
      delay as defined in RFC 3393 [RFC3393].

   o  packet loss - more important for certain applications, while other
      include very good algorithms for concealing it (e.g., some game
      genres).

   In this document we give recommendations for overall tolerable delays
   to be taken into account when optimizing network services by means of
   TCMTF.  In an interactive service, the total delay is composed by the
   addition of delays as defined in 3GPP TR 26.944 [TGPP_TR26.944].

   o  Transfer delay - from Host1 to Host2 at time T is defined by the
      statement: Host1 sent the first bit of a unit data to Host2 at
      wire-time T and that Host2 received the last bit of that packet at
      wire-time T+dT.  Thus, it includes the transmission delay (the
      amount of time Host1 requires to push all of the packet's bits
      into the wire) and the propagation delay in the network (the
      amount of time it takes for the head of the packet to travel from
      Host1 to Host2).

   o  Transaction delay - the sum of the time for a data packet to wait
      in queue and receive the service during the server transaction.

   Figure 2 illustrates these delays.  The labeled times (S and R)
   designate the times in which the packet is sent and received,
   respectively, by the network card interface.

   The use of TCMTF requires the addition of a multiplexer and a
   demultiplexer in the scenario.  A number of flows are multiplexed
   together before being sent through the network.  The packets are
   demultiplexed and rebuilt before being forwarded to the application
   server.  A scheme of TCMTF is included in Figure 3:

   This technique groups packets in order to build a multiplexed one.
   As previously stated, the focus of this document is on "multiplexing
   period" policy for creating the multiplexed packet combined with size
   limit policy.  Multiplexing period is a time frame in which the
   multiplexer waits for native packets to arrive in order to send them
   as one multiplexed packet.  If the multiplexed packet size limit is
   reached before the multiplexing period has run out (i.e., if enough
   native packets arrive to fill the limit), the multiplexed packet is
   sent right away.  In this way a certain amount of delay caused by the
   TCMTF optimization is added in the communication.  It is important to
   emphasize that multiplexing delay can't exceed the multiplexing
   period, and that it will only reach the value of multiplexing period
   on a link with a low traffic load.  Multiplexing delay can be
   classified as caused by the middlebox presence as defined in RFC 6390
   RFC 6390 [RFC6390].  The delay in the multiplexer includes the time
   during which the packets are retained until the bundled packet is
   sent, plus processing time.  In the demultiplexer however, the
   packets are not retained, so only the processing time is considered.

   Figure 4 shows the total delay, when a multiplexer and a
   demultiplexer are added.  It should be noted that multiplexing can be
   deployed independently in both directions, or only in one of them.

   With respect to efficiency in terms of use of the bandwidth, a
   tradeoff appears: the longer the multiplexing period, the higher the
   number of packets which can be grouped, thus obtaining better
   bandwidth savings.  So in order to calculate the maximum multiplexing
   period, the rest of the delays have to be considered: if the sum of
   transaction, and transfer delays is under the maximum tolerable
   delay, then multiplexing will be possible without harming the user
   experience.  The overall delay may be calculated according to the
   ITU-T Y.1541 recommendation [ITU-T_Y.1541].  Subtracting propagation,
   processing, and transmission delay from the tolerable delay for
   specific service results in the maximum value of the multiplexing
   period.

   Next, we will report the maximum tolerable latency for the previously
   listed real-time network services.

Internet-Draft     Delay Limits and Policies for TCMTF         June 2013


6.1.  VoIP

   For conversational audio, the International Telecommunication Union
   recommends [ITU-T_G.114] less than 150 millisecond one-way end-to-end
   delay for high-quality real time traffic, but delays between 150 ms
   and 400 ms are acceptable.  When considering conversational audio it
   should be noted that this delay limits include jitter buffers and
   codec processing.  For streaming audio, delay constraints are much
   looser, the delay should be less than 10 s [ITU-T_G.1010].

6.2.  Online games

   Online games comprise game genres which have different latency
   requirements.  This draft focuses on real-time online games and
   endorses the general game categorization proposed in
   [Claypool_Latency] in which online games have been divided into:

   o  Omnipresent, with the threshold of acceptable latency (i.e.,
      latency in which performance is above 75% of the unimpaired
      performance) of 1000 ms.  The most representative genre of
      omnipresent games are Real-Time Strategies.

   o  Third Person Avatar, with the threshold of acceptable latency of
      500 ms.  These games include Role Playing Games (RPG) and
      Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG).

   o  First Person Avatar, in which threshold of acceptable latency is
      100 ms.  The most popular subgenre of them are First Person
      Shooters, such as "Call of Duty" or "Halo" series.

   The study [Claypool_Latency] evaluated players' performance in
   certain tasks, while increasing latency, and reported values at which
   the performance dropped below 75% of the performance under unimpaired
   network conditions.  While measuring objective performance metrics,
   this method highly underestimates the impact of delays on players'
   QoE.  Further studies accessing a particular game genre reported much
   lower latency thresholds for unimpaired gameplay.

   A survey using a large number of First Person Shooter games has been
   carried out in [Dick_Analysis].  They state that latency about 80 ms
   could be considered as acceptable, since the games have been rated as
   "unimpaired".  Besides service QoE, it has been shown that delay has
   great impact on the user's decision to join a game, but significantly
   less on the decision to leave the game [Henderson_QoS].

   A study on Mean Opinion Score (MOS) evaluation, based on variation of
   delay and jitter for MMORPGs, suggested that MOS drops below 4 for
   delays greater than 120 ms [Ries_QoEMMORPG].  The MOS score of 5

Internet-Draft     Delay Limits and Policies for TCMTF         June 2013


   indicates excellent quality, while MOS score of 1 indicates bad
   quality.  Another study focused on extracting the duration of play
   sessions for MMORPGs from the network traffic traces showed that the
   session durations start to decline sharply when latency is between
   150 ms and 200 ms [Chen_HowSensitive].

   While original classification work [Claypool_Latency] states that
   latency up to 1 second is tolerated by omnipresent games, other
   studies argued that only latency up to 200 ms is tolerated by players
   of RTS games [Cajada_RTS].

6.3.  Remote desktop access

   For the remote computer access services, the delays are dependent on
   the task performed through the remote desktop.  Tasks may include
   operations whith audio, video and data (e.g., reading, web browsing,
   document creation).  A QoE study indicates that for audio latency
   below 225 ms and for data latency below 200 ms is tolerated
   [Dusi_Thin].

6.4.  Non real-time service

   Traffic flows of several types of non real-time services can be
   optimized using TCMTF.  Under this category we include services for
   M2M metering information, streaming audio, instant messaging, and web
   browsing.  M2M metering services are suitable for TCMTF optimization
   not only due to their very loose delay requirements, but also because
   of the one way nature of the communication (i.e., most information
   travels from sensors to the central server) [Liu_M2M].  Instant
   messaging (despite "instant" in its name) has been categorized as
   data service by the ITU-T, and it has been designated with acceptable
   delays of up to a few seconds [ITU-T_G.1010].

6.5.  Summary

   We group all the results in the Table 1 indicating the maximum
   allowed latency and proposed multiplexing periods.  Proposed
   multiplexing periods are guidelines, since the exact values are
   dependant of the existing delay in the network.  It should be noted
   that reported tolerable latency is based on values of preferred
   delays, and delays in which QoE estimation is not significantly
   degraded.  Multiplexing periods of about 1 second can be considered
   as sufficient for non real-time services (e.g., web browsing and
   streaming audio).
