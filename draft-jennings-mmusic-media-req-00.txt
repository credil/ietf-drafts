Abstract

   This document outlines some of the requirements driving various

Internet-Draft             Media Requirements              February 2013


1.  Introduction

   For the past several meetings, there has been discussions around
   various mechanism to reduce the number of UDP ports needed by
   applications for RTP.  This document attempts to capture some of the
   requirements that are important in selecting the solution for how to
   represent the SDP to negotiate the RTP media that is using reduced
   ports.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   This document generically uses RTP to mean RTP and SRTP.


3.  Requirements

   This section covers the requirements from various WG for setting up
   media.  Obviously it does not try and cover all the requirements but
   it tries to cover a set that seem relevant to decisions around
   multiplexing onto few UDP ports.

   High Priority Requirements:

   1.  Support many media flows but minimize the number of transport
       flows.  For instance, all media flows--or perhaps all media flows
       of a given type--might be multiplexed over a single transport
       flow.

   2.  Be able to successfully negotiate media with both legacy SIP
       devices and new devices (whether SIP or RTCWEB) with a single
       offer/answer exchange.  If both endpoints support multiplexed
       media, then multiplexing should be negotiated.  Otherwise, non-
       multiplexed media should be used.  In many cases, each endpoints
       will have no prior knowledge of capabilities of the other
       endpoint.

   Other Requirements:

   1.  Need a uniform way to allow specifications of new SDP parameters
       to easily explain any implications that multiplexing has on the
       new parameters in that specification.

   2.  Allow different sources (E.g. cameras) to use different codecs.
       For example, if one camera had hardware encoders for VP8 while

       another had encoders for H.264, the device may wish to negotiate
       different codecs.

   3.  Be able to to independently set parameters such as resolution
       bandwidth, independently for each RTCWeb Track, preferably even
       when they are all multiplexed over the same transport flow.

   4.  Be able to identify the RTCWeb tracks with an identifier that is
       stable over the duration of the session.  More information can be
       found in [I-D.alvestrand-mmusic-msid].


4.  Non-Requirements

   Some items are not a major goal.  If methods are found that work for
   these as well, that is great, but they are not a priority item.

   1.  Working with SIP proxies or B2BUA that are not compliant with the
       standards.  The reason for this is it is just not possible to
       design for every possible thing that does not do what the
       standards require.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   These requirements have no additional security considerations other
   than those captured in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch].
