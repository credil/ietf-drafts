             MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV Definition
                    draft-ietf-manet-packetbb-sec-08

Abstract

   This document describes general and flexible TLVs (type-length-value
   structure) for representing cryptographic signatures as well as
   timestamps, using the generalized MANET packet/message format defined
   in RFC 5444.  It defines two Packet TLVs, two Message TLVs, and two
   Address Block TLVs, for affixing cryptographic signatures and
   timestamps to a packet, message and address, respectively.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies:

   o  Two TLVs for carrying cryptographic signatures and timestamps in
      packets, messages, and address blocks as defined by [RFC5444],

   o  A generic framework for calculating cryptographic signatures,
      accounting (for Message TLVs) for mutable message header fields
      (<msg-hop-limit> and <msg-hop-count>), where these fields are
      present in messages.

   This document requests from IANA:

   o  Allocations for these Packet, Message, and Address Block TLVs from
      the 0-223 Packet TLV range, the 0-127 Message TLV range and the
      0-127 Address Block TLV range from [RFC5444],

   o  Creation of two IANA registries for recording code points for hash
      function and signature calculation, respectively.

   Finally, this document defines, in Section 12:

   o  One common method for generating signatures as a cryptographic
      function, calculated over the hash value of the content to be
      signed.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology and notation defined in [RFC5444].
   In particular, the following TLV fields from [RFC5444] are used in
   this specification:

   <msg-hop-limit>  - hop limit of a message, as specified in Section
      5.2 of [RFC5444].

   <msg-hop-count>  - hop count of a message, as specified in Section
      5.2 of [RFC5444].

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


   <length>  - length of a TLV in octets, as specified in Section 5.4.1
      of [RFC5444].


3.  Applicability Statement

   MANET routing protocols using the format defined in [RFC5444] are
   accorded the ability to carry additional information in control
   messages and packets, through inclusion of TLVs.  Information so
   included MAY be used by a MANET routing protocol, or by an extension
   of a MANET routing protocol, according to its specification.

   This document specifies how to include a cryptographic signature for
   a packet, a message, and addresses in address blocks within a
   message, by way of such TLVs.  This document also specifies how to
   treat "mutable" fields, specifically the <msg-hop-count> and <msg-
   hop-limit> fields, if present in the message header when calculating
   signatures, such that the resulting signature can be correctly
   verified by any recipient, and how to include this signature.

   This document describes a generic framework for creating signatures,
   and how to include these signatures in TLVs.  In Section 12, an
   example method for calculating such signatures is given, using a
   cryptographic function over the hash value of the content to be
   signed.


4.  Security Architecture

   Basic MANET routing protocol specifications are often "oblivious to
   security", however have a clause allowing a control message to be
   rejected as "badly formed" prior to it being processed or forwarded.
   MANET routing protocols such as [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] recognize
   external reasons (such as failure to verify a signature) for
   rejecting a message as "badly formed", and therefore "invalid for
   processing".  This architecture is a result of the observation that
   with respect to security in MANETs, "one size rarely fits all" and
   that MANET routing protocol deployment domains have varying security
   requirements ranging from "unbreakable" to "virtually none".  The
   virtue of this approach is that MANET routing protocol specifications
   (and implementations) can remain "generic", with extensions providing
   proper deployment-domain specific security mechanisms.

   The MANET routing protocol "security architecture", in which this
   specification situates itself, can therefore be summarized as
   follows:





Herberg & Clausen        Expires August 3, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


   o  Security-oblivious MANET routing protocol specifications, with a
      clause allowing an extension to reject a message (prior to
      processing/forwarding) as "badly formed".

   o  MANET routing protocol security extensions, rejecting messages as
      "badly formed", as appropriate for a given deployment-domain
      specific security requirement.

   o  Code-points and an exchange format for information, necessary for
      specification of such MANET routing protocol security extensions.

   This document addresses the last of these issues, by specifying a
   common exchange format for cryptographic signatures, making
   reservations from within the Packet TLV, Message TLV, and Address
   Block TLV registries of [RFC5444], to be used (and shared) among
   MANET routing protocol security extensions.

   For the specific decomposition of a signature into a cryptographic
   function over a hash value, specified in Section 12, this document
   establishes two IANA registries for code-points for hash functions
   and cryptographic functions adhering to [RFC5444].

   With respect to [RFC5444], this document:

   o  Is intended to be used in the non-normative, but intended, mode of
      use described in Appendix B of [RFC5444].

   o  Is a specific example of the Security Considerations section of
      [RFC5444] (the authentication part).


5.  Overview and Functioning

   This document specifies a syntactical representation of security
   related information for use with [RFC5444] addresses, messages, and
   packets, as well as establishes IANA registrations and registries.

   Moreover, this document provides guidelines for how MANET routing
   protocols, and MANET routing protocol extensions, using this
   specification, should treat Signature and Timestamp TLVs, and mutable
   fields in messages.  This specification does not represent a stand-
   alone protocol; MANET routing protocols and MANET routing protocol
   extensions, using this specification, MUST provide instructions as to
   how to handle packets, messages and addresses with security
   information, associated as specified in this document.

   This document requests assignment of TLV types from the registries
   defined for Packet, Message and Address Block TLVs in [RFC5444].

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


   When a TLV type is assigned from one of these registries, a registry
   for "Type Extensions" for that TLV type is created by IANA.  This
   document utilizes these "Type Extension" registries so created, in
   order to specify internal structure (and accompanying processing) of
   the <value> field of a TLV.

   For example, and as defined in this document, a SIGNATURE TLV with
   Type Extension = 0 specifies that the <value> field has no pre-
   defined internal structure, but is simply a sequence of octets.  A
   SIGNATURE TLV with Type Extension = 1 specifies that the <value>
   field has a pre-defined internal structure, and defines its
   interpretation (specifically, the <value> field consists of a
   cryptographic operation over a hash value, with fields indicating
   which hash function and cryptographic operation has been used,
   specified in Section 12).

   Other documents can request assignments for other Type Extensions,
   and MUST, if so, specify their internal structure (if any) and
   interpretation.


6.  General Signature TLV Structure

   The value of the Signature TLV is:

             <value> := <signature-value>

   where:

   <signature-value>  is a field, of <length> octets, which contains the
      information, to be interpreted by the signature verification
      process, as specified by the Type Extension.

   Note that this does not stipulate how to calculate the <signature-
   value>, nor the internal structure hereof, if any; such MUST be
   specified by way of the Type Extension for the SIGNATURE TLV type,
   see Section 13.  This document specifies two such type-extensions,
   for signatures without pre-defined structures, and for signatures
   constructed by way of a cryptographic operation over a hash-value.


7.  General Timestamp TLV Structure

   The value of the Timestamp TLV is:

          <value> := <time-value>

   where:



Herberg & Clausen        Expires August 3, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


   <time-value>  is an unsigned integer field, of length <length>, which
      contains the timestamp.

      Note that this does not stipulate how to calculate the <time-
      value>, nor the internal structure hereof, if any; such MUST be
      specified by way of the Type Extension for the TIMESTAMP TLV type,
      see Section 13.

   A timestamp is essentially "freshness information".  As such, its
   setting and interpretation is to be determined by the MANET routing
   protocol, or MANET routing protocol extension, that uses the
   timestamp, and can, e.g., correspond to a UNIX-timestamp, GPS
   timestamp or a simple sequence number.


8.  Packet TLVs

   Two Packet TLVs are defined, for including the cryptographic
   signature of a packet, and for including the timestamp indicating the
   time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

8.1.  Packet SIGNATURE TLV

   A Packet SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a Signature TLV as described
   in Section 6.

   The following considerations apply:

   o  As packets defined in [RFC5444] are never forwarded by routers, no
      special considerations are required regarding mutable fields (e.g.
      <msg-hop-count> and <msg-hop-limit>), if present, when calculating
      the signature.

   o  Any Packet SIGNATURE TLVs already present in the Packet TLV block
      MUST be removed before calculating the signature, and the Packet
      TLV block size MUST be recalculated accordingly.  Removed
      SIGNATURE TLVs SHOULD be restored after having calculated the
      signature value.

   The rationale for removing any Packet SIGNATURE TLV already present
   prior to calculating the signature is that several signatures may be
   added to the same packet, e.g., using different signature functions.

8.2.  Packet TIMESTAMP TLV

   A Packet TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a Timestamp TLV as described
   in Section 7.  If a packet contains a TIMESTAMP TLV and a SIGNATURE
   TLV, the TIMESTAMP TLV SHOULD be added to the packet before any

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


   SIGNATURE TLV, in order that it be included in the calculation of the
   signature.


9.  Message TLVs

   Two Message TLVs are defined, for including the cryptographic
   signature of a message, and for including the timestamp indicating
   the time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

9.1.  Message SIGNATURE TLV

   A Message SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a Signature TLV as described
   in Section 6.  When determining the <signature-value> for a message,
   the following considerations MUST be applied:

   o  The fields <msg-hop-limit> and <msg-hop-count>, if present, MUST
      both be assumed to have the value 0 (zero) when calculating the
      signature.

   o  Any Message SIGNATURE TLVs already present in the Message TLV
      block MUST be removed before calculating the signature, and the
      message size as well as the Message TLV block size MUST be
      recalculated accordingly.  Removed SIGNATURE TLVs SHOULD be
      restored after having calculated the signature value.

   The rationale for removing any Message SIGNATURE TLV already present
   prior to calculating the signature is that several signatures may be
   added to the same message, e.g., using different signature functions.

9.2.  Message TIMESTAMP TLV

   A Message TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a Timestamp TLV as described
   in Section 7.  If a message contains a TIMESTAMP TLV and a SIGNATURE
   TLV, the TIMESTAMP TLV SHOULD be added to the message before the
   SIGNATURE TLV, in order that it be included in the calculation of the
   signature.


10.  Address Block TLVs

   Two Address Block TLVs are defined, for associating a cryptographic
   signature to an address, and for including the timestamp indicating
   the time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


10.1.  Address Block SIGNATURE TLV

   An Address Block SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a Signature TLV as
   described in Section 6.  The signature is calculated over the
   address, concatenated with any other values, for example, any other
   address block TLV <value> fields, that is associated with that
   address.  A MANET routing protocol or MANET routing protocol
   extension using Address Block SIGNATURE TLVs MUST specify how to
   include any such concatenated attribute of the address in the
   verification process of the signature.  When determining the
   <signature-value> for an address, the following consideration MUST be
   applied:

   o  If other TLV values are concatenated with the address for
      calculating the signature, these TLVs MUST NOT be Address Block
      SIGNATURE TLVs already associated with the address.

   The rationale for not concatenating the address with any SIGNATURE
   TLV values already associated with the address when calculating the
   signature is that several signatures may be added to the same
   address, e.g., using different signature functions.

10.2.  Address Block TIMESTAMP TLV

   An Address Block TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a Timestamp TLV as
   described in Section 7.  If both a TIMESTAMP TLV and a SIGNATURE TLV
   are associated with an address, the TIMESTAMP TLV <value> SHOULD be
   considered when calculating the value of the signature.


11.  Signature: Basic

   The basic signature, represented by way of a SIGNATURE TLV with Type
   Extension = 0, is a simple bit-field containing the cryptographic
   signature.  This assumes that the mechanism stipulating how
   signatures are calculated and verified is established outside of this
   specification, e.g., by way of administrative configuration or
   external out-of-band signaling.  Thus, the <signature-value> for when
   using Type Extension = 0 is:

             <signature-value> := <signature-data>

   where:

   <signature-data>  is an unsigned integer field, of length <length>,
      which contains the cryptographic signature.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


12.  Signature: Cryptographic Function over a Hash Value

   One common way of calculating a signature is applying a cryptographic
   function on a hash value of the content.  This decomposition is
   specified in the following, using a Type Extension = 1 in the
   Signature TLVs.

12.1.  General Signature TLV Structure

   The following data structure allows representation of a cryptographic
   signature, including specification of the appropriate hash function
   and cryptographic function used for calculating the signature:

             <signature-value> := <hash-function>
                                  <cryptographic-function>
                                  <key-index>
                                  <signature-data>

   where:

   <hash-function>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field specifying the
      hash function.

   <cryptographic-function>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field
      specifying the cryptographic function.

   <key-index>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field specifying the key
      index of the key which was used to sign the message, which allows
      unique identification of different keys with the same originator.
      It is the responsibility of each key originator to make sure that
      actively used keys that it issues have distinct key indices and
      that all key indices have a value not equal to 0x00.  The value
      0x00 is reserved for a pre-installed, shared key.

   <signature-data>  is an unsigned integer field, whose length is
      <length> - 3, and which contains the cryptographic signature.

   The version of this TLV, specified in this section, assumes that
   calculating the signature can be decomposed into:

      signature-value = cryptographic-function(hash-function(content))

   The hash function and the cryptographic function correspond to the
   entries in two IANA registries, set up by this specification in
   Section 13.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


12.1.1.  Rationale

   The rationale for separating the hash function and the cryptographic
   function into two octets instead of having all combinations in a
   single octet - possibly as TLV type extension - is that adding
   further hash functions or cryptographic functions in the future may
   lead to a non-contiguous number space.

   The rationale for not including a field that lists parameters of the
   cryptographic signature in the TLV is that, before being able to
   validate a cryptographic signature, routers have to exchange or
   acquire keys (e.g. public keys).  Any additional parameters can be
   provided together with the keys in that bootstrap process.  It is
   therefore not necessary, and would even entail an extra overhead, to
   transmit the parameters within every message.  One implicitly
   available parameter is the length of the signature, which is <length>
   - 3, and which depends on the choice of the cryptographic function.

12.2.  Considerations for Calculating the Signature

   In the following, considerations are listed, which MUST be applied
   when calculating the signature for Packet, Message and Address
   SIGNATURE TLVs, respectively.

12.2.1.  Packet SIGNATURE TLV

   When determining the <signature-value> for a Packet, the signature is
   calculated over the three fields <hash-function>, <cryptographic-
   function> and <key-index> (in that order), concatenated with the
   entire Packet, including the packet header, all Packet TLVs (other
   than Packet SIGNATURE TLVs) and all included Messages and their
   message headers, in accordance with Section 8.1.

12.2.2.  Message SIGNATURE TLV

   When determining the <signature-value> for a message, the signature
   is calculated over the three fields <hash-function>, <cryptographic-
   function>, and <key-index> (in that order), concatenated with the
   entire message.  The considerations in Section 9.1 MUST be applied.

12.2.3.  Address Block SIGNATURE TLV

   When determining the <signature-value> for an address, the signature
   is calculated over the three fields <hash-function>, <cryptographic-
   function>, and <key-index> (in that order), concatenated with the
   address, concatenated with any other values, for example, any other
   address block TLV <value> that is associated with that address.  A
   MANET routing protocol or MANET routing protocol extension using

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


   Address Block SIGNATURE TLVs MUST specify how to include any such
   concatenated attribute of the address in the verification process of
   the signature.  The considerations in Section 10.2 MUST be applied.

12.3.  Example of a Signed Message

   The sample message depicted in Figure 1 is derived from appendix D of
   [RFC5444].  The message contains a SIGNATURE Message TLV, with the
   value representing a 16 octet long signature of the whole message.
   The type extension of the Message TLV is 1, for the specific

13.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines:

   o  Two Packet TLV types, which must be allocated from the 0-223 range
      of the "Assigned Packet TLV Types" repository of [RFC5444] as
      specified in Table 1,

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV      January 2012


   o  Two Message TLV types, which must be allocated from the 0-127
      range of the "Assigned Message TLV Types" repository of [RFC5444]
      as specified in Table 2,

   o  Two Address Block TLV types, which must be allocated from the
      0-127 range of the "Assigned Address Block TLV Types" repository
      of [RFC5444] as specified in Table 3.

   This specification requests:

   o  Creation of type extension registries for these TLV types with
      initial values as in Table 1 to Table 3.

   IANA is requested to assign the same numerical value to the Packet
   TLV, Message TLV and Address Block TLV types with the same name.

   The following terms are used with the meanings defined in [BCP26]:
   "Namespace", "Assigned Value", "Registration", "Unassigned",
   "Reserved", "Hierarchical Allocation", and "Designated Expert".

   The following policies are used with the meanings defined in [BCP26]:
   "Private Use", "Expert Review", and "Standards Action".

13.1.  Expert Review: Evaluation Guidelines

   For the registries for TLV type extensions where an Expert Review is
   required, the designated expert SHOULD take the same general
   recommendations into consideration as are specified by [RFC5444].

   For the Timestamp TLV, the same type extensions for all Packet,
   Message and Address Block TLVs SHOULD be numbered identically.

13.2.  Packet TLV Type Registrations

   IANA is requested to make allocations from the "Packet TLV Types"
   namespace of [RFC5444] for the Packet TLVs specified in Table 1.

14.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify a protocol.  It provides a syntactical
   component for cryptographic signatures of messages and packets as
   defined in [RFC5444].  It can be used to address security issues of a
   MANET routing protocol or MANET routing protocol extension.  As such,
   it has the same security considerations as [RFC5444].

   In addition, a MANET routing protocol or MANET routing protocol
   extension that uses this specification MUST specify the usage as well
   as the security that is attained by the cryptographic signatures of a
   message or a packet.

   As an example, a MANET routing protocol that uses this component to
   reject "badly formed" messages if a control message does not contain
   a valid signature, SHOULD indicate the security assumption that if
   the signature is valid, the message is considered valid.  It also
   SHOULD indicate the security issues that are counteracted by this
   measure (e.g. link or identity spoofing) as well as the issues that
   are not counteracted (e.g. compromised keys).
