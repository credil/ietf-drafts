      Resource Records for EUI-48 and EUI-64 Addresses in the DNS
               draft-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes-00

Abstract

   EUI-48 and EUI-64 are address formats specified by the IEEE for use
   in various layer-2 networks, e.g. ethernet.

   This document defines two new DNS resource record types, EUI48 and
   EUI64, for encoding ethernet addresses in the DNS.

Internet-Draft     Resource Records for EUI-48, EUI-64        March 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].
   This base specification defines many Resource Record Types (RRTypes),
   and subsequent specifications have defined others.  Each defined
   RRType provides a means of encoding particular data in the DNS.

   EUI-48 [EUI48] and EUI-64 [EUI64] are address formats specified by
   the IEEE for use in various layer-2 networks, e.g. ethernet.

   This document defines two new Resource Record Types (RRTypes), EUI48
   and EUI64 for encoding EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses in the DNS.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Presentation Format Considerations

   Various representations of EUI-48 and EUI-64 addresses are used in
   common implementations, depending on application and vendor
   preference.  For example, the EUI-48 address 7cd1c3e8102f might
   reasonably be represented as any of the following:

   o  7cd1c3e8102f

   o  7c:d1:c3:e8:10:2f

   o  7c-d1-c3-e8-10-2f

   o  7cd1.c3e8.102f

   There is no canonical representation defined by the IEEE.

   The use of a single representation for use in the DNS promotes ease
   of implementation and information retrieval, and this document
   specifies (see Section 4.2, Section 5.2) that the second
   representation on this list be used, that of two-digit hexadecimal
   numbers separated by colons.  The digits A through F may be
   represented in either upper or lower case.

4.  The EUI48 Resource Record

   The EUI48 RR is used to store EUI-48 addresses in the DNS.

   The Type value for the EUI48 RRType is XXTBA1.

   The EUI48 RR is class-independent.

   The EUI48 RR has no special TTL requirements.

4.1.  EUI48 RDATA Wire Format

   The RDATA for an EUI48 RR consists of a single, 6-octet EUI48-Address
   field, encoded in network (big-endian) order.

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

4.2.  EUI48 RR Presentation Format

   The Address field MUST be represented as six two-digit hexadecimal
   numbers separated by colons.  The hexadecimal digits "A" through "F"
   MAY be represented in either upper or lower case.

5.  The EUI64 Resource Record

   The EUI64 RR is used to store EUI-64 addresses in the DNS.

   The Type value for the EUI64 RR is XXTBA2.

   The EUI64 RR is class-independent.

   The EUI64 RR has no special TTL requirements.

5.1.  EUI64 RDATA Wire Format

   The RDATA for an EUI48 RR consists of a single, 8-octet Address
   field, encoded in network (big-endian) order.

                           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

5.2.  EUI64 RR Presentation Format

   The Address field MUST be represented as eight two-digit hexadecimal

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document directs the IANA to assign two entries in the "Resource
   Record (RR) TYPEs" subregistry as follows:

     D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.

        The purpose of this RRTYPE application is to allow EUI-48
        and EUI-64 addresses to be stored in the DNS. EUI-48
        addresses are those used, for example, in ethernet.

     E. Description of the proposed RR type.

        See draft-jabley-dnsext-eui48-eui64-rrtypes for a full
        description.

     F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that
        need and why are they unsatisfactory?

        The TXT record can be used to store arbitrary, unstructured
        data in the DNS and hence could be used to store EUI-48 and
        EUI-64 addresses. This approach is unsatisfactory for the
        usual reasons, i.e. there is no opportunity for validating
        data before it is stored, and typographical errors must
        consequently be detected after data retrieval.

     G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

        EUI48 for EUI-48 addresses; EUI64 for EUI-64 addresses.

     H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA
        registry or require the creation of a new IANA sub-registry
        in DNS Parameters?  If so, please indicate which registry is
        to be used or created. If a new sub-registry is needed, specify

        the allocation policy for it and its initial contents. Also
        include what the modification procedures will be.

        No.

     I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
        servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
        as an unknown RRTYPE (see [RFC3597])?

        No.

        specification.
