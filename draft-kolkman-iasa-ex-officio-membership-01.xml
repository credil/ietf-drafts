	BCP101 <xref target="RFC4071"/><xref target="RFC4371"/>
	appoints the IETF chair, the IAB chair, and the ISOC
	President/CEO, collectively refered to as I*-chairs, as ex
	officio voting members to the IAOC and the IETF Trust. Access
	to IAOC meetings and notes by these ex-officio members is
	important because first hand information about the trade-offs
	made in the IAOC will inform the I-Chairs activities, besides
	the I-Chairs can provide an integrated perspective about their
	bodies work to the IAOC.
      </t>
      <t>
	On the other hand, a lot of the IAOC work is 'business as
	usual' and presence of I-Chairs is not always
	required if it were not for the reasonable due dilligence
	requirements that come with being a voting member.
      </t>
      <t>
	Therefore, introduction of flexibility in the appointment
	model allows the burden on these leadership position to be
	reduced which makes those leadership positions more attractive
	for potential candidates.
      </t>
      <t>
	This memo describes the changes in the membership of the IAOC
	to achieve this while maintaining the ability for the
	I*-chairs to provide their (broad) persective to the IAOC
	activities. The I*-chairs lose their voting rights, but
	maintain the possibility to influence decisions through direct
	participation in all IAOC and Trust activities.
      </t>

	This document updates BCP101 (<xref target="RFC4071"/> and
