                draft-li-mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk-01

Abstract

   MPLS TE has been widely deployed to provide traffic engineering and
   traffic protection.  The complexity in configuration has much effect
   on the MPLS TE deployment in the large-scale network.  The document
   identifies the configuration issues for MPLS TE deployment and
   proposes a new mechanism, the service-driven mechanism, by which the
   setup of co-routed MPLS TE LSPs is triggered by the bidirectional
   service.  Then the document provides the framework for setting up
   service-driven co-routed MPLS Traffic-Engineered Label-Switched
   Paths(TE LSPs) for L2VPN and L3VPN.

1.  Introduction

   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineering (TE)
   effectively schedules, allocates, and uses existing network resources
   to provide bandwidth guarantee and traffic protection.  MPLS TE
   establishes label switched paths (LSPs) satisfying specific traffic
   engineering attributes [RFC2702].  MPLS TE is being widely deployed
   to support packet-based services.  Since rich set of traffic
   engineering attributes have to be specified for each LSP and a great
   deal of configuration has to be done as the number of MPLS TE LSPs
   increases, a scalable and simple solution is required to implement TE
   on a large-scale network and reduce the complexity in operation and
   management of TE LSPs.

   LDP LSP setup is topology-driven which is a scalable way to adapt to
   the large-scale network.  The similar way cannot be used for MPLS TE
   since the traffic engineering attributes should be specified for the
   MPLS TE tunnel which is not necessary for LDP LSP.  On the other
   hand, MPLS TE LSP is always setup to bear specific services such as
   L3VPN and L2VPN.  That is, MPLS TE LSPs will not be setup aimlessly
   which is always inevitable for MPLS topology-driven LSP if there is
   no policy exerted on it.  So it seems a natural way to combine the
   MPLS TE LSP setup with the service it beared.  The MPLS TE LSP setup
   can be triggered automatically by the service instead of explicitly
   configuring each tunnel and its traffic engineering attributes.  We
   call this method as service-driven comparing to topology-driven.  In
   addition the service-driven method has much advantage in the process
   of setting up co-routed TE LSPs.  The service beared by MPLS TE LSPs
   is always bi-directional.  The characteristic can be utilized to
   setup the forward MPLS TE LSP and the co-routed reverse MPLS TE LSP.

   This document describes the framework of automatically setting up co-
   routed TE LSPs, in which the co-routed MPLS TE LSPs are automatically
   setting up on demand of the services, e.g.  VPNs.  This mechanism
   facilitates the provisioning of services and the TE LSPs.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the MPLS architecture document
   [RFC3031], the RSVP-TE protocol specification [RFC3209] which
   inherits from the RSVP specification [RFC2205] and the Provider
   Provisioned VPN terminology document [RFC4026].

   The document introduces two new concepts by which VPN PEs can be
   generally categorized into two types:

   1.  Active PE: the PE which primarily triggers the set up of the LSPs
   and informs the remote PE;

   2.  Passive PE: the PE which secondarily complies with the active
   PE's suggestion to set up LSPs.

   In this document, the terminology of "tunnel" is identical to the "TE
   Tunnel" defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC3209], which is uniquely
   identified by a SESSION object that includes Tunnel end point
   address, Tunnel ID and Extended Tunnel ID.  The terminology "LSP" is
   identical to the "LSP tunnel" defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC3209],
   which is uniquely identified by the SESSION object together with
   SENDER_TEMPLATE (or FILTER_SPEC) object that consists of LSP ID and
   Tunnel end point address.

3.  Problem Statement

3.1.  Massive Configuration Issue of TE LSPs

   It is a common deployment scenario to set up MPLS TE LSPs among a set
   of Label Switching Routers (LSR).  Such deployment may require the
   configuration of a potentially large number of TE tunnels.

                      Figure 1 Mobile Backhaul Network


   Figure 1 shows an example of the mobile backhaul network.  Mobile
   multimedia devices such as smartphones are ubiquitous now which runs
   a wide variety of bandwidth-intensive applications and causes
   unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic.  In order to cope with
   the growth, more cell sites are introduced into the network: more LTE
   eNodeBs and associated Cell Site Gateways(CSGs) are added in the
   networks.  This causes the network scale expands fast and more and
   more MPLS TE tunnels need setup between Cell Site Gateways(CSGs)
   connects the eNodeBs and RNC site gateways(RSGs) connects the RNCs.
   Typically, we assume that:

   1.  There are 1,000 CSGs need to connect to one RSG.

   2.  There are three types of bi-directional services beared between
   one CSG and one RSG.  Each type of service needs one VPN and one TE
   tunnel.

   3.  There are 10 command lines to configure necessary attributes for
   each TE tunnel and at least one command line to bind one VPN to one
   TE tunnel.

   Then there are at least 66,000 command lines to configure MPLS TE
   tunnels and VPN and TE tunnel bindings.  It is truly a huge
   configuration work.  The operation is not only time consuming but
   also prone to mis-configuration for Service Providers.  Hence, a
   mechanism to set up MPLS TE tunnels automatically is desirable which
   can significantly reduce the complexity of MPLS TE configuration.

                       |   (3) IP Path (Return Path)  |
                       |<-----------------------------|

                       Figure 2: BFD for TE LSPs Scenario


   As shown in Figure 2, BFD for MPLS LSPs ([RFC5884]) is used to detect
   the possible failure fast which can trigger traffic switch between
   the primary LSP and the backup LSP.  When BFD for MPLS LSPs is
   deployed, the return path may take IP path which is different from
   the forward path.  The failure that happens in the return path may
   cause wrong traffic switch.

   In order to solve the return path issue of BFD for MPLS LSPs, it has
   to be guaranteed that the forward path and the return path must be
   co-routed.  For MPLS TE LSPs explicit path has to be configured for
   the forward LSP and the return LSP.  In addition, there is at least
   one configuration to bind the return BFD traffic corresponding to the
   forward BFD traffic to the right return MPLS TE tunnel at the ingress
   node or the egress node.  This will deteriorate the configuration
   work described above.  In addition, if the forward path changes, the

   return path may not change accordingly owing to statically binding
   the forward path and the return path.  It will cause that the return
   path issue of BFD for MPLS LSPs happens again.

3.3.  Upgrading Issue of Co-routed Bidirectional LSP

   The co-routed bidirectional LSP is defined in [RFC3945].  If co-
   routed bidirectional LSP is used, the return path is not necessary to
   configure and the return path issue of BFD for LSPs can be solved
   naturally.  This can simplify operation and management for Service
   Providers to some extent.  But as to the example described in sec 3.2
   it is still necessary to configure each tunnel and configure explicit
   binding of each tunnel and VPN pair.  The configuration work is still
   a little complex.  In addition, the unidirectional LSPs have been
   deployed widely and it is difficult for the service providers to
   upgrade all possible routers to support co-routed bidirectional LSPs.

4.  Framework and Procedures

   MPLS TE LSPs depend heavily on manual configuration.  So some auto
   configuration method (e.g.  auto mesh [RFC4972]) has been proposed.
   This document proposes a new mechanism, the service-driven mechanism,
   to reduce the operation cost of MPLS TE networks.

   It is well known that LDP LSP setup is topology-driven which is a
   scalable way to adapt to the large-scale network.  The similar way
   cannot be used for MPLS TE since the traffic engineering attributes
   has to be specified for the MPLS TE tunnel.  On the other hand, MPLS
   TE LSP is always setup to bear specific services such as L3VPN and
   L2VPN.  That is, MPLS TE LSPs will not be setup aimlessly which is
   always inevitable for MPLS topology-driven LSP if there is no policy
   exerted on it.  So it is a natural way to trigger MPLS TE LSP setup
   by the service instead of explicitly configuring each tunnel.  We
   call this method as service-driven comparing to topology-driven.
   BGP-based MVPN ([RFC6513] and [RFC6514]) provides an example of
   service-driven tunnel which can trigger P2MP TE tunnel setup after
   MVPN membership auto-discovery.

   The service-driven method also has much advantage in the process of
   setting up co-routed TE LSPs.  The service beared by MPLS TE LSPs is
   always bi-directional.  The characteristic can be utilized to setup
   the forward MPLS TE LSP and the co-routed reverse MPLS TE LSP.  This
   section describes the framework and procedures of setting up the co-
   routed MPLS TE LSPs.  In this method, MPLS TE LSPs can be set up on
   demand which can reduce the manual configuration.  The signaling of
   the service will advertise the tunnel information between the active
   PE and the passive PE.  The PE on the passive side can set up the
   reverse LSP based on RRO information of the LSP from the active PE to

   the passive PE.  Thus the path of the reverse LSP can be co-routed
   with the path of the LSP from the active PE to the passive PE.

   Service-driven co-routed MPLS TE LSP has following advantages:

   1) Setup LSP on demand and save massive configuration effort.

   2) Reuse current mechanism instead of whole network upgrading.

   L2VPN, as defined in [RFC4664], is a proven and widely deployed
   technology.  Figure 3 shows a framework for co-routed MPLS TE LSPs
   driven by L2VPN service.  L2VPN is provisioned on PEs and the PW is
   setup.  A pair of PEs for a specific PW will be identified as the
   active PE and the passive PE respectively.  The active PE triggers
   the set up of the primary LSP to the passive PE and advertises the
   tunnel information to the passive PE.  According to the information
   advertised by the active PE, the passive PE will set up the reverse
   MPLS TE LSP which is co-routed with the LSP from the active PE to the
   passive PE LSP.

4.1.2.1.  Active/Passive Role Election

   The active and passive role of PEs can be determined through manual
   configuration or dynamic election between two PEs.  If the dynamic
   election method is used, LSR IDs of a pair of PEs between which PW is
   setup are compared as unsigned integers and the PE with the larger
   value of LSR ID assumes the active role.

Internet-Draft     A Framework for SD Co-Routed LSPs          April 2013


   In the service-driven co-routed MPLS TE framework for L2VPN, the
   tunnel information need to be advertised between the active PE and
   the passive PE.  The passive PE uses the tunnel information to get
   corresponding MPLS TE tunnel and RRO information which is used to
   setup the reverse co-routed MPLS TE LSP.
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-pw-over-bidir-lsp] defines how the
   bidirectional Tunnel/LSP identifier information is advertised between
   a pair of PEs for PW.  The similar mechanism can be reused for
   advertising MPLS TE tunnel/LSP identifier information for service-
   driven MPLS TE LSPs for L2VPN.

4.1.2.3.  Operation

   Step 1: Active/passive role election through signaling between PEs of
   a PW.  In this case, assume PE1 as active PE and PE2 as passive PE
   after election;

   Step 2: As the active role, the PW service on PE1 drives RSVP-TE to
   create TE LSP(e.g.  LSP1), as the passive role, PE2 waits for tunnel
   information advertised by PE1;

   Step 3: PE1 advertises tunnel information related with LSP1 to PE2;

   Step 4: PE2 gets tunnel information from PE1 and creates TE LSP (e.g.
   LSP2) according to RRO information derived from LSP1.  PE2 binds LSP1
   and LSP2 for PW;

   Step 5: PE2 advertises tunnel information related with LSP2 to PE1;

   Step 6: PE1 binds LSP1 and LSP2 for PW.

   Through the above procedure, the co-routed MPLS TE LSPs driven by the
   PW are established.

                    Figure 5: Framework of L3VPN driven TE Tunnel


   L3VPN services are provided by [RFC4110].  Figure 5 shows a framework
   for co-routed MPLS TE LSPs driven by L3VPN.  L3VPN is provisioned on
   PEs and VPN membership is discovered.

   A pair of PEs for a specific L3VPN are identified as the active PE
   and the passive PE respectively.  The active PE initiates the set up
   of the primary LSP to the passive PE and advertises the tunnel
   information to the passive PE.  According to the information
   advertised by the active PE, the passive PE will set up the reverse
   MPLS TE LSP which is co-routed with the forward LSP from the active
   PE to the passive PE.

             Figure 6: Signaling Procedures of L3VPN driven co-routed TE LSPs


   Figure 6 shows the detailed procedures for L3VPN to drive the set up
   of co-routed MPLS TE LSPs.  Through the above procedure, the co-
   routed MPLS TE LSPs driven by the L3VPN are established.

4.2.2.1.  VPN Membership Auto-Discovery

   In order to set up co-routed MPLS TE LSPs in L3VPN, a point-to-point
   connection between any two VRFs of a particular VPN needs to be
   established.  VPN membership auto-discovery should be done firstly
   and the mechanism defined in [I-D.dong-l3vpn-pm-framework] can be
   used.

4.2.2.2.  Active/Passive Role Election

   After obtaining the VPN membership information via VPN membership
   auto-discovery process, we can identify a pair of VPN members.

   The active and passive role of PEs can be determined through manual
   configuration or dynamic election between two PEs.  If the dynamic
   election method is used, LSR IDs of a pair of PEs corresponding to
   the pair of VPN members are compared as unsigned integers and the PE
   with the larger value of LSR ID assumes the active role.

4.2.2.3.  Signaling Tunnel Information

   In the service-driven co-routed MPLS TE framework for L3VPN, the
   tunnel information need to be advertised between the active PE and
   the passive PE.  The passive PE uses the tunnel information to get
   corresponding MPLS TE tunnel and RRO information which is used to
   setup the reverse co-routed MPLS TE LSP.  MP-BGP signaling need
   extensions to advertise the MPLS TE tunnel/LSP identifier information
   for service-driven MPLS TE LSPs for L3VPN.

   Step 1: VPN membership auto-discovery process is done through
   signaling to identify a pair of VPN members;

   Step 2: Active/passive role election through signaling between a pair
   of PEs of a L3VPN.  In this case, assume PE1 as active PE and PE2 as
   passive PE after election;

   Step 3: As the active role, L3VPN service on PE1 drives RSVP-TE to
   create TE LSP(e.g.  LSP1), as the passive role, PE2 waits for tunnel
   information advertised by PE1;

   Step 4: PE1 advertises tunnel information related with LSP1 to PE2;

   Step 5: PE2 gets tunnel information from PE1 and creates TE LSP (e.g.
   LSP2) according to RRO information derived from LSP1.  PE2 binds LSP1
   and LSP2 for L3VPN;

   Step 6: PE2 advertises tunnel information related with LSP2 to PE1;

   Step 7: PE1 binds LSP1 and LSP2 for L3VPN.

   Through the above procedure, the co-routed MPLS TE LSPs driven by the
   L3VPN are established.
