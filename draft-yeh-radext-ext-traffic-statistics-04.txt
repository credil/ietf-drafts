Internet-Draft        RADIUS Accounting Extensions          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   RADIUS has been widely used as the centralized authentication,
   authorization and subscriber management method for the service
   provision in Broadband access network.  [RFC3162], [RFC4818] and
   [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access] have specified some attributes to
   support the service provision for IPv6 access.  In the meantime,
   RADIUS is also a protocol for carrying accounting information between
   a Network Access Server (NAS) and a shared accounting server.  In the
   scenarios of dual-stack or any other IPv6 migration technologies,
   there is a demand to report the separated IPv4 & IPv6 traffic
   statistics for the differential accounting and traffic recording.

   [BBF TR-187], whose purpose is to describe the network architecture
   and elements requirements in the PPPoE scenario to support IPv6-only
   or dual-stack for Internet access service, has explicitly expressed
   in its Section 9.4, that the BNG must be able to support separate
   queues, input and output counters for IPv4 or IPv6 traffic.  Note
   that BNG of BBF is a kind of broadband NAS of IETF.  Meanwhile [BBF
   TR-187] suggested to use the RADIUS attributes (eg.  Acct-Input-
   Octets (42), Acct-Output-Octets (43), Acct-Input-Packets (47), Acct-
   Output-Packets (48)) for the combination of IPv6 and IPv4 traffic.
   That means the new RADIUS attributes for reporting the separated IPv4
   or IPv6 traffic statistics are required to be defined.

   [I-D.hu-v6ops-radius-issues-ipv6-00] presented the same issue on
   'protocol specific accounting' for the dual-stack traffic statistics,
   but it also limits to the PPP case.
   [I-D.maglione-radext-ipv6-acct-extensions-01] and
   [I-D.yeh-radext-dual-stack-access-02] tried to defined a batch of
   attributes on the traffic statistics respectively for the IPv6-only
   access and dual-stack access in the traditional type space with the
   flat mode , while [I-D.winter-radext-fancyaccounting] indicated that
   the accounting attributes of Input-Octets, Output-Octets, Input-
   Packets and Output-Packets can be grouped in the new basic data type
   of TLV-nesting defined in Section 2.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions] for the extended type space.
   According to [RFC6158] and Section 6.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions], Nesting-TLV is the only
   recommendation for the new attribute design which intends to employ
   multiple fields in the complex data type now.  Based on the judge of
   the quickly-exhausted traditional type space, the Radext Working
   Group tends to adopt the new data type of nesting-TLV defined for the
   extended type space to report the traffic statistics for the
   accounting extension.

   This document specifies new attributes of the traffic statistics with
   different types for the extension of RADIUS accounting to support the

   differentiated accounting policies and traffic recording on the AAA
   server.  The reporting traffic types include the combination of stack
   types and the optional DSCP types.

   Note: This document tries to narrow the scope of the solution space
   just to meet the requirements explicitly expressed by the industry
   without defining new RADIUS messages or introducing a new namespace
   for the additional interoperability.


2.  Terminology and Conventions

   Definitions for terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this
   document are defined in [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2869], [RFC3575],
   [RFC6158], and [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   Figure 1 shows the typical use case of the traffic statistics
   reporting for the dual-stack users.

   Note that traffic statistics reporting is also needed in the IPv6
   transition cases, such as DS-Lite, 6rd or MAP, where AFTR (Address
   Family Transition Router) or BR (Border Router) may act as the
   broadband NAS.


4.  Acct-Traffic-Statistics attribute

   Acct-traffic-statistics attribute is designed according to the
   guidelines described in [RFC6158] and Section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions].  It adopts the data structure of

   the TLV nesting, has 1 container attribute, Acct-Traffic-Statistics,
   and 6 contained sub-attributes, Stack-Type, Input-Octets, Output-
   Octets, Input-Packets, Output-Packets, DSCP-Type (Differentiated
   Services CodePoint), and possible support the extensible types of
   traffic statistics in the future.  The sub-attribute of Stack-Type
   MUST be included, one or more sub-attribute of Input-Octets, Output-
   Octets, Input-Packets or Output-Packets sub-attributes MUST be
   included and sub-attribute of DSCP-Type MAY be included in the
   container attribute, Acct-Traffic-Statistics.  Because each of the
   sub-attributes has its own type code, the appearance of the contained
   sub-attributes is not necessary in a fixed order.

4.1.  Container attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics

   Description

      The container attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics, which includes
      sub-attributes of Stack-Type, or DSCP-Type, and Input-Octets,
      Output-Octets, Input-Packets or Output-Packets, reports how many
      octets or packets of the specified traffic type, from the user or
      sent to the user, from the starting of the associated service
      provided.  The sub-attributes of Stack-Type or DSCP-Type indicates
      the specified traffic type.  One or more Acct-traffic-statistics
      attribute can be presented in Accounting-Request(4) message while
      the Acct-Status-Type(40) is set to Interim-Update or Stop.

4.2.6.  Acct-Traffic-Statistics.DSCP-Type

   Description

      Acct-Traffic-Statistics.DSCP-Type sub-attribute indicates the DSCP
      type of the separated or combined IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

      The format of Acct-Traffic-Statistics.DSCP-Type sub-attribute is
      shown as below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Length

      6

   Value

      Enumerated Data Type in 4-Octet unsigned integer defined in
      [RFC6158].  The beginning 3 Octets are reserved for future use,
      and are set to 0x00 now.  The first 2 bits of the last octet are
      reserved for future use, and are set to 00 now.  The last 6 bits
      of the last octet is used to contain the DSCP value as per
      [RFC2474].


5.  Table of Attribute

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   The meaning of the above table entries is as follows:

   0    This attribute MUST NOT be present.
   0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present.
   0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.
   1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present.
   1+   One or more of these attributes MUST be present.


6.  Diameter Considerations

   Given that the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from
   the RADIUS extended type space (see Section 8), no special handling
   is required by Diameter entities.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related RADIUS are described in Section 8 of
   [RFC2865] and Section 5 of [RFC3162].


8.  IANA Considerations

   The authors of this document request to assign new Radius type codes
   for Acct-Traffic-Statistics and its following sub-attributes.

   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Stack-Type
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Input-Octets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Output-Octets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Input-Packets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Output-Packets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.DSCP-Type

   These type codes should be allocated from the RADIUS extended type
   space based on Section 10 of [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions] and
   "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].


9.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Roberta Maglione, Jie Hu for their efforts in the history
   to bring this problem to IETF, to Stefan Winter, Alan DeKok, Peter
   Deacon for their valuable comments in the mailing list of Radext.
