    A privacy protection scheme for AKA agreement in 3rd Generation
                   Partnership Project(3GPP) standard
                    draft-zhang-aka-privacy-3gpp-00

Abstract

   This document contains a privacy protection scheme for the AKA
   agreement in the 3GPP standards.  Specifically, this document
   RECOMMENDS that each user owns a encryption key updated in real time,
   with which to encrypt the user identity.  Comparing with the
   asymmetric encryption and alias assignment, the symmetric encryption
   scheme proposed in this document not only reduce the computation
   burden, but also prevent the legal user from being located and
   tracked.

1.  Introduction

   In the 3gpp standard, the element in core network exchanges
   authentication information of AKA protocol with user to achieve
   mutual authentication and key negotiation.  Although AKA agreement
   has overcome the security vulnerabilities of GSM system effectively,
   many security issues still can't be resolved such as the disclosure
   of user identity.  So, a new scheme is proposed in this document to
   achieve user identity confidentiality.

1.1.  What is the User Identity Confidentiality

   The following security features related to user identity
   confidentiality are provided[TS_25.331_3GPP]:

   user identity confidentiality: the property that the permanent user
   identity (IMSI) of a user to whom a service is delivered cannot be
   eavesdropped on the radio access link;

   user location confidentiality: the property that the presence or the
   arrival of a user in a certain area cannot be determined by
   eavesdropping on the radio access link;

   user untraceability: the property that an intruder cannot deduce
   whether different services are delivered to the same user by
   eavesdropping on the radio access link.

   |<----------International Mobile Subscriber Iedntity(IMSI)---------->|

                          Figure 1 IMSI structure

   As figure 1, the permanent user identity (IMSI) of a user is composed
   of MCC, MNC and MSIN.  MSIN identifies a user uniquely, while MCC and
   MNC are used to provide the routing information of its HLR.  To
   realize the user identity confidentiality, the MSIN is protected to
   avoid the attacker obtaining this information.  Therefore, this
   document proposes a new IMSI protection method, that is, to assign a
   real-time updated encryption key for each user and encrypt the MSIN
   with it, which not only protects the user identity privacy, but also
   prevents the user from being illegally loacted and tracked.

1.2.  Overview of the AKA Agreement

   AKA is an acronym of the Authentication and Key Agreement protocol in
   third generation mobile communication network[TS_25.331_3GPP].  The
   protocol is a safety specification proposed by the International
   Mobile Telecommunications Organization 3GPP( The Third Generation
   Partnership Project ) according to the security demand in 3G access
   domain, based on the security vulnerability of 2G network.  Using the
   challenge-response mechanism, AKA agreement completes the
   authentication and the key negotiation between the user and the
   network.  The main flow of AKA agreement is as follows:

              Figure 2 The standard process of AKA agreement

   (1) Upon receipt of the service request, the VLR/SGSN will send the
   authentication data request message to the HLR, but the IMSI message
   is in plaintext form.

   (2) Upon receipt of the authentication data request message, the HLR
   will retrieve a key K shared with MS according to the IMSI message.
   Then, HLR will send the response message with the authentication
   vector array AVs to the VLR/SGSN.

   (3) After receiving the AVs, the VLR/SGSN will store them in the
   database and retrieve an unused vector when authenticate a user.
   Then, he will sent a user authentication request messages to the MS,
   including RAND and AUTN.

   (4 )After receiving the authentication data RAND||AUTN from the VLR/
   SGSN, the MS verifies the network identity.  If succeed, the MS will
   calculate the response value RES=f2(k,RAND) and sent it to the VLR/
   SGSN, getting the encryption key IK and integrity key CK.

   (5) After receiving the RES value, the VLR/SGSN verifies the user
   identity.  If succeed, he will retrieve a CK and a IK from a database
   as the encryption key and the integrity key.  Otherwise, the VLR/SGSN
   will send a failure report to the MS.

   From the AKA agreement flow, some facts can be noticed that although
   the core network can achieve mutual authentication between the user
   and the network and complete the negotiation of communication key,
   but the IMSI message is transmitted in plaintext form, which will

   lead to leakage of user privacy.  The user MAY suffer from being
   located and tracked.

2.  Related Work about the Privacy Protection

   In the 3GPP specification[TS_25.331_3GPP], a temporary mobile
   subscriber identity(TMSI) is used to protect the user identity.  But
   in some cases, such as, when the user initially registers in network,
   or when the serving network cannot retrieve the IMSI from the TMSI,
   the user will response the IMSI information in plaintext form, which
   will threaten the safety of the user identity.

   Therefore, some researchers use encryption or alias allocation to
   achieve IMSI protection, and encryption method is divided into
   symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.  The
   literature[MobSeUseconf][EnConfAKA] use HLR public key to encrypt
   IMSI information, and the literature[ResImpro] adds a public key
   update measure based on the literature[MobSeUseconf], but the
   asymmetric encryption will increase large computation overhead for
   mobile devices.  In the literature[KerImpiden], a HLR and all of his
   clients share a key.  When the user submits IMSI information, he will
   use a encryption key generated by the sharing key to encrypt IMSI
   information.  However, the method has a risk of sharing key exposure,
   once the sharing key is leaked, all users belonged to the HLR MAY be
   attacked.  Therefore, the literature[EnhIdnAKA] suggests that each
   user uses their own root key Ki to encrypt IMSI information, and the
   HLR traverses the stored (IMSI, Ki) records and decrypts.  Encrypting
   with the root key, we can avoid the disadvantages of the sharing key,
   but a large amount of calculation will be in the network terminal and
   the efficiency will be low.  The method that replaces the IMSI with
   updated identification[ImpIdncon][EtoEIdnConf][EnhIdnPri] can
   guarantee the confidentiality and untraceability of the user
   identity, but the network terminal needs to maintain a large
   identification library because the corresponding user identity will
   frequently changed.

                  Table 1 structure of key library in HLR

   Table 1 shows the structure of key library in HLR.  The key library
   is composed of multiple records, each record includes four
   properties, that is, the key identification number KEY_ID, encryption
   key KEY, operating situation STATUS and the update time TIME.
   Operating situation indicates whether the key has been assigned to
   the user.  If not, the mark will be FREE, otherwise the mark will be
   USED.  The time mark of this record is immediately updated.

   Upon receipt of the authentication request, HLR extracts the
   decryption key corresponding to K_IDold and updates the STATUS to
   FREE.  Then from those records whose state is FREE, the HLR allocates
   a key identification and the corresponding key to the user, and
   update the STATUS of this record to USED.  But in the allocation
   process, the user movement or transmission error and other reasons
   MAY lead to failure in identification allocation, thus multiple users
   MAY use a same key.  In this case, the security of IMSI information
   will not be affected because of its encryption transmission.

   In addition, if a key_ID cannot be allocated successfully, this
   key_ID will keep USED state for a long time and present a dead
   phenomenon, which means that this key can not be allocated again.
   For such kind of condition, this document utilizes the time stamp to
   judge whether the record is in the working state.  For a certain
   record, if his status is USED and Tupdate>Tdied , the system can
   determine that this record have already been dead.  So the STATUS of
   this record will be updated to FREE, and the system releases this
   key_ID.

   Note:HLR_ID=MCC||MNC, which is used to provide routing information of
   HLR.  K_IDold and Kold refer to the key identification and encryption
   key currently used; K_IDnew and Knew refer to the key identification
                    and encryption key newly allocated.

          Figure 3 AKA protocol flow with protected user privacy

   The improved AKA agreement flow with enhanced privacy confidentiality
   is described below:

   (1) The VLR/SGSN launches a user identity request message to the MS,
   which requests the MS' IMSI information.

   (2) The MS responses the encrypted MSIN information, combining with
   HLR_ID to be the encrypted IMSI information.  Meanwhile, the MS
   submits the key identification K_IDold, which indicats the current
   encryption key.  The encrypted IMSI information is
   HLR_ID||K_IDold||f11(Kold,MSIN).

   The USIM card will store a key identification and the corresponding
   encryption key, and the initial value is randomly distributed by the
   key library of the HLR while the USIM card is generated.

   (3) Upon receipt of the response messages from the MS, the VLR/SGSN
   will send the authentication data request message to HLR according to
   the routing information provided by HLR_ID.  This message includes
   the encrypted IMSI information and the encryption key identification
   K_IDold.

   (4) According to the received K_IDold, the HLR extracts the
   corresponding decryption key to retrieve the MS' IMSI and changes the
   corresponding state to FREE.  After that, HLR will produce the
   authentication vectors for this user:

   AV=RAND||XRES||CK||IK||AUTN

   AUTN=(SQN xor AK)||AMF||MAC

   MAC=f1(k,SQN||RAND||AMF)

   XRES=f2(k,RAND) AK=f5(k,RAND)

   CK=f3(k,RAND) IK=f4(k,RAND)

   Then the HLR distributes a new key identification K_IDnew and an
   encryption key Knew to the user, and embeds them into the RAND of AVs
   with the embedding function F, as figure 4 shows.

                K_IDnew||Knew--->------+

                    Figure 4 Produce process of RANDin

   So, we will obtain the authentication vector
   AVin=RANDin||XRES||CK||IK||AUTN.  Finally, the HLR will send the new
   authentication vectors and IMSI information to the VLR/SGSN:
   AVs||IMSI.

   (5) The VLR/SGSN stores the authentication vectors AVs and IMSI
   information transmitted from the HLR.  When a user is authenticated,
   the VLR/ SGSN selects an unused authentication vector and sends the
   authentication request message to the MS, including the
   RAND(i)||AUTN(i) in authentication vector.

   (6) The MS uses the inverse function F' of embedding function F to
   extract K_IDnew||Knew and random number RAND, as figure 5 shows.

       Ki----------->--------+
                      +-------|------+
       RANDin-------->|      F'      |----->RAND  and  K_IDnew||Knew
                      +-------|------+

          Figure 5 Extraction process with extracting function F'

   With the data in AUTN(i)=(SQN xor AK)||AMF||MAC and the retrieved
   random number RAND, we computer below data:

   AK=f5(K,RAND) SQN=(SQN xor AK) xor AK XMAC=f1(K,SQN||RAND||AMF)

   To compare the XMAC with the MAC, we continue to verify whether SQN
   belongs to the normal range if they match.  If the sequence number is
   not fresh, the VLR/SGSN will send synchronous failure message to the
   user and end the authentication process, otherwise the authentication
   of network identity is successful.  Next, the MS calculates the
   response value RES=f2(K,RAND) and sends it to the VLR/SGSN, then
   calculates the encryption key CK=f3(K,RAND) and the integrity key
   IK=f4(K,RAND) for network communication.  At the same time, the MS
   stores K_IDnew and Knew as the new key identification and new
   encryption key to protect IMSI.

   (7) Upon receipt of the RES, the VLR/SGSN will compare the XRES with
   the RES, the authentication of the user is successful if they match,
   and the VLR/SGSN will select CK and IK from authentication vector as

   the encryption key and the integrity key for communication,
   respectively.  Otherwise, the user authentication is failed.

4.  Security Considerations

   IMSI information is the only identification of a user, if this
   message is intercepted by the attacker, it is easy to loacte and
   track the user.  In this document, we use the timing updated
   encryption key to protect the confidentiality of the user identity.
   The user always provides encrypted IMSI information to HLR, thus the
   attacker cannot obtain plaintext IMSI.  What's more, the HLR will
   constantly update the encryption key assigned to the user, which
   means that the form of each encrypted IMSI information is different
   from each other.  Thus the improved method can prevents the user from
   being located and tracked.
