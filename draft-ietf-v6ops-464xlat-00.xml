    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an architecture (464XLAT) for providing IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only network by combining existing and well-known stateful protocol translation RFC 6146 in the core and stateless protocol translation RFC 6145 at the edge. 464XLAT is a simple and scalable technique to quickly deploy IPv4 access service to mobile and wireline IPv6-only edge networks without encapsulation.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IANA unallocated IPv4 address pool was exhausted on February 3, 2011. Each RIR's unallocated IPv4 address pool will exhaust in the near future. It will be difficult for many networks to assign IPv4 addresses to end users, despite substantial IP connectivity growth required for mobile devices, smart-grid, and cloud nodes.</t>

      <t>This document describes an IPv4 over IPv6 solution as one of the techniques for IPv4 service extension and encouragement of IPv6 deployment.</t>

      <t>The 464XLAT architecture described in this document uses IPv4/IPv6 translation standardized in <xref target="RFC6145"></xref> and <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>. It does not require DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"></xref>,  but it may use DNS64 to enable single stateful translation <xref target="RFC6146"></xref> instead of 464XLAT double translation where possible. It is also possible to provide single IPv4/IPv6 translation service, which will be needed in the future case of IPv6-only servers and peers to be reached from legacy IPv4-only hosts. The 464XLAT architecture encourages IPv6 transition by making IPv4 services reachable across IPv6-only networks and providing IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity to single-stack IPv4 or IPv6 servers and peers.</t>

      <t>Running a single-stack IPv6-only network has several operational benefits in terms of increasing scalability and decreasing operational complexity. Unfortunately, there are important cases where IPv6-only networks fail to meet subscriber expectations, as described in <xref target="I-D.arkko-ipv6-only-experience"></xref>. The 464XLAT overcomes the issues described in <xref target="I-D.arkko-ipv6-only-experience"></xref> to provide subscribers the full dual-stack functionality while providing the network operator the benefits of a simple yet highly scalable single-stack IPv6 network.</t>

    <section title="Motivation and Uniqueness of 464XLAT">

      <t><list hangIndent="4" style="hanging">
	<t hangText="1.">Minimal IPv4 resource requirements</t>
	<t>464XLAT is the most efficient use of scarce IPv4 addresses for networks that have fast growing edges.  The primary motivation for deploying IPv6 is the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and the risk that exhaustion poses to future internet growth. 464XLAT directly takes on the challenge of IPv4 address exhaustion by providing efficient stateful IPv4 address sharing at the PLAT and decoupling the edge network growth from the availability of scarce IPv4 addresses.</t>

	<t>464XLAT has low barriers to entry since only a small amount of IPv4 addresses are needed to support the stateful translation <xref target="RFC6146"></xref> function in the PLAT.</t>

	<t>Given that network operators are deploying IPv6 because IPv4 resources are scarce, solutions that require dual-stack (no IPv4 multiplexing) or stateless address sharing (bounded static address multiplexing) are simply not IPv4-efficient enough to solve the two-pronged challenge of increasing IPv4 address scarcity and continued exponential network edge growth.</t>

	<t hangText="2.">No new protocols required</t>
	<t>464XLAT can be deployed today, it uses existing RFCs (<xref target="RFC6145"></xref> and <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>), and there exists implementations for both wireline network (CLAT in the home router) and wireless 3GPP network (CLAT in the UE).  The ability to quickly deploy 464XLAT is a critical feature given the urgency of IPv4 exhaustion and brisk pace of internet growth.</t>

	<t hangText="3.">Cost-effective transition to IPv6</t>
	<t>When combined with DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"></xref>, the 464XLAT architecture only requires double translation in the case of IPv4-referrals or IPv4-only socket calls.  Consequently, the network traffic in the ISP backbone network is predominately IPv6 end-to-end or single translation.  This is especially cost-effective in wireless 3GPP GSM and UMTS networks that would otherwise require two separate PDP connections to support IPv4 and IPv6.</t>

	<t>While translation on the CLAT is not always used, the CLAT function is crucial for enabling the IPv4-only applications and providing IP address family service parity to the end-users.  All IPv6-native flows pass end-to-end without any translation.  This is a beneficial solution for end-users, content providers, and network operators that scale best with end-to-end IPv6 communication.</t>

      </list></t>

          <t>In summary, the 464XLAT architecture works today for service providers that require large-scale strategic IPv6 deployments to overcome the challenges of IPv4 address scarcity. Unlike other transition architectures associated with tunneling or <xref target="I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port"></xref>, 464XLAT properly assumes that IPv4 is scarce and IPv6 must work with today's existing systems as much as possible. In the case of tunneling, the tunneling solutions like Dual-Stack Lite <xref target="RFC6333"></xref> are known to break existing network based deep packet inspection solutions like 3GPP standardized Policy and Charging Control (PCC). 464XLAT does not require much IPv4 address space to enable the stateful translation <xref target="RFC6146"></xref> function in the PLAT while providing global IPv4 and IPv6 reachability to IPv6-only wireline and wireless subscribers.</t>

      <t>When an ISP has IPv6 access network infrastructure and 464XLAT, the ISP can provide IPv4 service to end users across an IPv6 access network. The result is that edge network growth is no longer tightly coupled to the availability of scarce IPv4 addresses.</t>

      <t>If the IXP or another provider operates the PLAT, the ISP is only required to deploy an IPv6 access network. All ISPs do not need IPv4 access networks. They can migrate their access network to a simple and highly scalable IPv6-only environment. Incidentally, Japan Internet Exchange(JPIX) is providing 464XLAT trial service since July 2010.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Wireless 3GPP Network Applicability">

      <t>The vast majority of mobile wireless networks are compliant to Pre-Release 9 3GPP standards. In Pre-Release 9 3GPP networks, GSM and UMTS networks must signal and support both IPv4 and IPv6 PDP attachments to access IPv4 and IPv6 network destinations. Since there are 2 PDPs required to support 2 address families, this is double the number of PDPs required to support the status quo of 1 address family, which is IPv4. Doubling the PDP count to support IPv4 and IPv6 is generally not operationally viable since a large portion of the network cost is derived from the number of PDP attachments, both in terms of licenses from the network hardware vendors and in terms of actual hardware resources required to support and maintain the PDP signaling and mobility events.  Doubling the number of PDP attachments has been one of the major barriers to introducing IPv6 in mobile networks. Dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 simply costs more from the network provider perspective and does not result in any new revenues. In 3GPP Release 9 and forward, 2 PDPs are no longer required but the scarcity of IPv4 addresses remain.</t>

      <t>Now that both global and private IPv4 addresses are scarce to the extent that it is a substantial business risk and limiting growth in many areas, the mobile network providers must support IPv6 to solve the IP address scarcity issue. It is not feasible to simply turn on additional IPv6 PDP network attachments since that does not solve the near-term IPv4 scarcity issues and it increases cost in most cases. The most logical path forward is to replace IPv4 with IPv6 and replace the common NAT44 with stateful translation <xref target="RFC6146"></xref> and DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"></xref>.  Extensive live network testing with hundreds of friendly-users has shown that IPv6-only network attachments for mobile devices supports over 85% of the common applications on the Android mobile operating systems.  The remaining 15% of applications do not work because the application requires an IPv4 socket or the application does an IPv4-referral. These findings are consistent with the mobile IPv6-only user experience in <xref target="I-D.arkko-ipv6-only-experience"></xref>.</t>

      <t>464XLAT in combination with stateful translation <xref target="RFC6146"></xref> and DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"></xref> allows 85% of the Android applications to continue to work with single translation or native IPv6 access. For the remaining 15% of applications that require IPv4 connectivity, the CLAT function on the UE provides a private IPv4 address and IPv4 default-route on the host for the applications to reference and bind to.  Connections sourced from the IPv4 interface are immediately routed to the CLAT function and passed to the IPv6-only mobile network, destine to the PLAT. In summary, the UE has the CLAT function that does a stateless translation <xref target="RFC6145"></xref>, but only when required. The mobile network has a PLAT that does stateful translation <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>.</t>

        <section title="DNS Proxy Implementation">
          <t>The case of an IPv4-only node behind CLAT querying an IPv4 DNS server is undesirable since it requires both stateful and stateless translation for each DNS lookup. The CLAT SHOULD set itself as the DNS server via DHCP or other means and proxy DNS queries for IPv4 and IPv6 clients. Using the CLAT enabled home router or UE as a DNS proxy is a normal consume gateway function and simplifies the traffic flow so that only IPv6 native queries are made across the access network. The CLAT SHOULD allow for a client to query any DNS server of its choice and bypass the proxy.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="IPv6 Prefix Handling">
          <t>In the best case, the CLAT will have a dedicated /64 via DHCPv6 or other means to source and receive IPv6 packets associated with the <xref target="RFC6145"></xref> stateless translation of IPv4 packets to the local clients.</t>

          <t>In cases where the access network does not allow for a dedicated translation prefix, the CLAT SHOULD take ownership of the lowest /96 from an attached interface's /64 to source and receive translation traffic. Establishing ownership of the /96 requires that the CLAT SHOULD perform NDP so that no other nodes on the /64 may use the lowest /96. This will be the case for 3G phones on IPv6-only networks that do not yet support DHCPv6 prefix delegation or the case for some wireline environments that can only receive RA.</t>

          <t>The CLAT may discover the Pref64::/n of the PLAT via some method such as DHCPv6 option, TR-069, or <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="IPv6 Fragment Header Consideration">
          <t>In the 464XLAT environment, the PLAT and CLAT SHOULD include an IPv6 Fragment Header, since IPv4 host does not set the DF bit. However, the IPv6 Fragment Header has been shown to cause operational difficulties in practice due to limited firewall fragmentation support, etc. Therefore, the PLAT and CLAT may provide a configuration function that allows the PLAT and CLAT not to include the Fragment Header for the non-fragmented IPv6 packets. The function provide a configuration function to adjust minimum IPv6 MTU, or can configure whether it include the Fragment Header. At any rate, both behaviors SHOULD match.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="CLAT in a Gateway">
          <t>The CLAT is a stateless translation feature which can be implemented in a common home router or mobile phone that has a mobile router feature. The router with CLAT function SHOULD provide common router services such as DHCP of <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> addresses, DHCPv6, and DNS service. The router SHOULD set itself as the DNS server advertised via DHCP or other means to the clients so that it may implement the DNS proxy function to avoid double translation of DNS request.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="CLAT to CLAT communications">
          <t>While CLAT to CLAT IPv4 communication may work when the client IPv4 subnets do not overlap, this traffic flow is out of scope. 464XLAT is a hub and spoke architecture focused on enabling IPv4-only services over IPv6-only access networks.</t>
        </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Deployment Considerations">
          <t>Even if the Internet access provider for consumers is different from the PLAT provider (another Internet access provider or Internet exchange provider, etc.), it can implement traffic engineering independently from the PLAT provider. Detailed reasons are below:</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="4" style="hanging">
	<t hangText="1.">The Internet access provider for consumers can figure out IPv4 source address and IPv4 destination address from translated IPv6 packet header, so it can implement traffic engineering based on IPv4 source address and IPv4 destination address (e.g. traffic monitoring for each IPv4 destination address, packet filtering for each IPv4 destination address, etc.). The tunneling methods do not have such a advantage, without any deep packet inspection for processing the inner IPv4 packet of the tunnel packet.</t>

	<t hangText="2.">If the Internet access provider for consumers can assign IPv6 prefix greater than /64 for each subscriber, this 464XLAT architecture can separate IPv6 prefix for native IPv6 packets and XLAT prefix for IPv4/IPv6 translation packets. Accordingly, it can identify the type of packets ("native IPv6 packets" and "IPv4/IPv6 translation packets"), and implement traffic engineering based on IPv6 prefix.</t>
      </list></t>

          <t>This 464XLAT architecture has two capabilities. One is a IPv4 -> IPv6 -> IPv4 translation for sharing global IPv4 addresses, another is a IPv4 -> IPv6 translation for reaching IPv6-only servers from IPv4-only clients that can not support IPv6. IPv4-only clients must be support through the long period of global transition to IPv6.</t>
