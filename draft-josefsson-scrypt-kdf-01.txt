           The scrypt Password-Based Key Derivation Function
                     draft-josefsson-scrypt-kdf-01

Abstract

   This document specifies the password-based key derivation function
   scrypt.  The function derives one or more secret keys from a secret
   string.  It is based on memory-hard functions which offer added
   protection against attacks using custom hardware.  The document also
   provides an ASN.1 schema.

1.  Introduction

   Password-based key derivation functions are used in cryptography for
   deriving one or more secret keys from a secret value.  Over the
   years, several password-based key derivation functions have been
   used, including the original DES-based UNIX Crypt-function, FreeBSD
   MD5 crypt, PKCS#5 PBKDF2 [RFC2898] (typically used with SHA-1), GNU
   SHA-256/512 crypt, Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) hash, and the
   Blowfish-based bcrypt.  These algorithms are based on similar
   techniques that employ a cryptographic primitive, salting and/or
   iteration.  The iteration count is used to slow down the computation.

   Providing that the number of iterations used is increased as computer
   systems get faster, this allows legitimate users to spend a constant
   amount of time on key derivation without losing ground to an
   attackers' ever-increasing computing power - as long as attackers are
   limited to the same software implementations as legitimate users.
   However, as Bernstein pointed out in the context of integer
   factorization, while parallelized hardware implementations may not
   change the number of operations performed compared to software
   implementations, this does not prevent them from dramatically
   changing the asymptotic cost, since in many contexts - including the
   embarrassingly parallel task of performing a brute-force search for a
   passphrase - dollar-seconds are the most appropriate units for
   measuring the cost of a computation.  As semiconductor technology
   develops, circuits do not merely become faster; they also become
   smaller, allowing for a larger amount of parallelism at the same
   cost.  Consequently, existing key derivation algorithms, even when
   the iteration count is increased so that the time taken to verify a
   password remains constant, the cost of finding a password by using a
   brute force attack implemented in hardware drops each year.

   The scrypt function aims to reduce the advantage which attackers can
   gain by using custom-designed parallel circuits for breaking
   password-based key derivation functions.

   For further background, see the original scrypt paper [SCRYPT].

   The rest of this document is divided into sections that each describe
   algorithms needed for the final "scrypt" algorithm.

2.  The Salsa20/8 Core Function

   Salsa20/8 Core is a round-reduced variant of the Salsa20 Core.  It is
   a hash function from 64-octet strings to 64-octet strings.  Note that
   Salsa20/8 Core is not a cryptographic hash function since it is not
   collision-resistant.  See [SALSA20CORE] for the specification.

3.  The scryptBlockMix Algorithm

   The scryptBlockMix algorithm is the same as the BlockMix algorithm
   described in [SCRYPT] but with Salsa20/8 Core used as the hash
   function H. Below, Salsa(T) corresponds to the Salsa20/8 Core
   function applied to the octet vector T.

   Algorithm scryptBlockMix

   Parameters:
            r       Block size parameter.

   Input:
            B[0], ..., B[2 * r - 1]
                    Input vector of 2 * r 64-octet blocks.

   Output:
            B'[0], ..., B'[2 * r - 1]
                    Output vector of 2 * r 64-octet blocks.

   Steps:

     1. X = B[2 * r - 1]

     2. for i = 0 to 2 * r - 1 do
          T = X xor B[i]
          X = Salsa (T)
          Y[i] = X
        end for

     3. B' = (Y[0], Y[2], ..., Y[2 * r - 2],
              Y[1], Y[3], ..., Y[2 * r - 1])

4.  The scryptROMix Algorithm

   The scryptROMix algorithm is the same as the ROMix algorithm
   described in [SCRYPT] but with scryptBlockMix used as the hash
   function H and the Integerify function explained inline.

   Algorithm scryptROMix

   Input:
            r       Block size parameter.
            B       Input octet vector of length 128 * r octets.
            N       CPU/Memory cost parameter, must be larger than 1,
                    a power of 2 and less than 2^(128 * r / 8).

   Output:
            B'      Output octet vector of length 128 * r octets.

   Steps:

     1. X = B

     2. for i = 0 to N - 1 do
          V[i] = X
          X = scryptBlockMix (X)
        end for

     3. for i = 0 to N - 1 do
          j = Integerify (X) mod N
                 where Integerify (B[0] ... B[2 * r - 1]) is defined
                 as the result of interpreting B[2 * r - 1] as a
                 little-endian integer.
          T = X xor V[j]
          X = scryptBlockMix (T)
        end for

     4. B' = X

5.  The scrypt Algorithm

   The PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 function used below denote the PBKDF2
   algorithm [RFC2898] used with HMAC-SHA-256 [RFC6234] as the PRF.  The
   HMAC-SHA-256 function generates 32 octet outputs.

   Algorithm scrypt

   Input:
            P       Passphrase, an octet string.
            S       Salt, an octet string.
            N       CPU/Memory cost parameter, must be larger than 1,
                    a power of 2 and less than 2^(128 * r / 8).
            r       Block size parameter.
            p       Parallelization parameter, a positive integer
                    less than or equal to ((2^32-1) * hLen) / MFLen
                    where hLen is 32 and MFlen is 128 * r.
            dkLen   Intended output length in octets of the derived
                    key; a positive integer less than or equal to
                    (2^32 - 1) * hLen where hLen is 32.

   Output:
            DK      Derived key, of length dkLen octets.

   Steps:

     1. B[0] || B[1] || ... || B[p - 1] =
          PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (P, S, 1, p * 128 * r)

     2. for i = 0 to p - 1 do
          B[i] = scryptROMix (r, B[i], N)
        end for

     3. DK = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (P, B[0] || B[1] || ... || B[p - 1],
                                 1, dkLen)

6.  ASN.1 Syntax

   This section defines ASN.1 syntax for the scrypt key derivation
   function.  The intended application of these definitions includes
   PKCS #8 and other syntax for key management.  (Various aspects of
   ASN.1 are specified in several ISO/IEC standards.)

   The object identifier id-scrypt identifies the scrypt key derivation
   function.

   id-scrypt OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {1 3 6 1 4 1 11591 4 11}

   The parameters field associated with this OID in an
   AlgorithmIdentifier shall have type scrypt-params:

   scrypt-params ::= SEQUENCE {
          salt OCTET STRING,
          costParameter INTEGER (1..MAX),
          blockSize INTEGER (1..MAX),
          parallelizationParameter INTEGER (1..MAX),
          keyLength INTEGER (1..MAX) OPTIONAL }

   The fields of type scrypt-params have the following meanings:

   - salt specifies the salt value.  It shall be an octet string.

   - costParameter specifies the CPU/Memory cost parameter N.

   - blockSize specifies the block size parameter r.

   - parallelizationParameter specifies the parallelization parameter.

   - keyLength, an optional field, is the length in octets of the
   derived key.  The maximum key length allowed depends on the
   implementation; it is expected that implementation profiles may
   further constrain the bounds.  This field only provides convenience;
   the key length is not cryptographically protected.

6.1.  ASN.1 Module

   For reference purposes, the ASN.1 syntax is presented as an ASN.1
   module here.

11.  Test Vectors for scrypt

   For reference purposes, we provide the following test vectors for
   scrypt, where the password and salt strings are passed as sequences
   of ASCII [ANSI.X3-4.1986] octets.

   The parameters to the scrypt function below are, in order, the
   password P (octet string), the salt S (octet string), the CPU/Memory
   cost parameter N, the block size parameter r, and the parallelization
   parameter p, and the output size dkLen.  The output is hex encoded
   and whitespace is inserted for readability.

   scrypt (P="", S="",
           N=16, r=1, p=1, dklen=64) =

15.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a cryptographic algorithm.  The reader must
   follow cryptographic research of published attacks.  ROMix has been
   proven sequential memory-hard under the Random Oracle model for the
   hash function.  The security of scrypt relies on the assumption that
   BlockMix with Salsa20/8 Core does not exhibit any "shortcuts" which
   would allow it to be iterated more easily than a random oracle.  For
   other claims about the security properties see [SCRYPT].

   Passwords and other sensitive data, such as intermediate values, may
   continue to be stored in memory, core dumps, swap areas, etc, for a
   long time after the implementation has processed them.  This makes
   attacks on the implementation easier.  Thus, implementation should
   consider storing sensitive data in protected memory areas.  How to
   achieve this is system dependent.

   By nature and depending on parameters, running the scrypt algorithm
   may require large amounts of memory.  Systems should protect against
   a denial of service attack resulting from attackers presenting
   unreasonably large parameters.
