               IP/MPLS Connectivity Provisioning Profile
          draft-boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-profile-00

Abstract

   This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
   and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP connectivity requirements
   to be met in the context of delivery of services (e.g.  Voice over IP
   or IP TV) which are to be plugged upon an IP/MPLS infrastructure.

   The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by
   the underlying IP/MPLS transport network together with a reachability
   scope and bandwidth/capacity needs.  Appropriate performance metrics
   such as one-way delay, one-way delay variation are used to
   characterize an IP transfer service.  Both global and restricted
   reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.

Internet-Draft                     CPP                    September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)
   and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP/MPLS connectivity
   requirements to be met in the context of delivery of services (e.g.,
   Voice over IP, IP TV, VPN services) which are to be plugged upon an
   IP/MPLS infrastructure.

   The CPP defines the set of IP/MPLS transfer guarantees to be offered
   by the underlying IP/MPLS transport network together with a
   reachability scope and capacity needs.  Appropriate performance
   metrics such as one-way delay or one-way delay variation are used to
   characterize the IP transfer service.  Guarantees related to
   availability and resiliency are also included in the CPP.

   The CPP assumes service differentiation at the network layer can be
   enforced by tweaking various parameters which belong to distinct
   dimensions (e.g, forwarding, routing, traffic access management,
   traffic classification, etc.).

   The CPP can be used in both the vertical model (i.e., the service and
   network infrastructures are managed by the same administrative
   entity) or the functional separation model (i.e., where distinct
   administrative entities mange the service and the network
   infrastructures).  In the following sections, no assumption is made
   about the deployment model (vertical or separation).

   The CPP also aims at rationalizing the connectivity needs of above-
   deployed services and then to handle in a generic fashion all these
   requirements.  Service-specific IP provisioning rules may lead to
   increase the required IP transfer classes to be (pre)-engineered in
   the operational network.  As such, the use of the CPP allows to
   engineer generic and limited number of classes and then map
   individual CPP to these classes.  Instantiating each CPP into a
   distinct class of service should be avoided.  Therefore, application-
   agnostic IP provisioning practices should be recommended since the
   requirements captured in the CPP can be used to identify which
   network class of service is to be used to meet those requiremenst/
   guarantees.

   CPP may also be used as a "hint" or a guideline for the network
   dimensioning and planning departments to ensure that appropriate
   resources (e.g., network cards, routers, upgrade link capacity, etc.)
   have been provisioned.  Otherwise, (underlying) IP/MPLS networks
   would not be able to meet the targets expressed in all CPP requests
   (see Figure 1).

                        Figure 1: CPP: Interactions

   The customer shown in Figure 1 may be a service provider (e.g., IP
   telephony service provider) which requires invoking resources
   provided by an underlying network provider or an enterprise which
   wants to interconnect its sites using VPN services offered by a
   network provider.

   The definition of a clear interface between the service and the
   network layers has various advantages, such as rationalizing the
   engineering of network infrastructures.  The CPP interface aims at
   exposing and characterizing the IP transfer requirements to be met
   between the Customer Nodes (e.g., Media Gateway, Session Border
   Controller, etc.) when invoking IP transfer capabilities.  These
   requirements include: reachability scope (e.g., limited scope,
   Internet-wide), bandwidth requirements, QoS parameters (e.g., one-way
   delay [RFC2679], loss [RFC2680] or one-way delay variation
   [RFC3393]), protection and high availability guidelines (e.g., sub-
   50ms/sub-100ms/second restoration).  These requirements will then be
   translated into IP/MPLS-related technical clauses (e.g., need for
   recovery means, definition of the class of services, need for control
   plane protection, etc.) and in a further stage be addressed by the
   activation of adequate network features and technology-specific
   actions (e.g., MPLS-TE [RFC3346], RSVP [RFC2205], OSPF or IS-IS
   configuration, etc.).

   Customer Nodes belong to a service infrastructure or an enterprise
   site (see Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4).  The connectivity between
   these Customer Nodes is implemented owing to the IP transfer
   capability implemented through a collaboration of a set of IP
   resources.  IP transfer capabilities are considered by the above
   services as black boxes.  Appropriate notifications and reports would
   be communicated (through dedicated means) to Customer Nodes to assess
   the level of the experienced IP transfer service.  These
   notifications may also be used to assess the efficiency of the
   various policies enforced in the networking infrastructure to
   accommodate the requirements detailed in the CPP.

1.1.  Scope

   This document details the clauses of the CPP.  Protocols used to
   negotiate and to enforce a CPP are out of scope.

   In addition to CPP clauses, other clauses may be included in an
   agreement between a customer and a provider (e.g., contact point,
   escalation procedure, incidents management, billing, etc.).  It is
   out of scope of this document to detail all those additional clauses.

   Examples of how to translate CPP clauses into technology-specific
   policies are provided for illustration purposes.  It is out of scope
   of this document to provide an exhaustive list of the technical means
   to meet the objective included in a CPP.


2.  Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)

   A CPP can be seen as an inventory of connectivity provisioning
   requirements with regard to IP transfer service.  This section lists
   the clauses of the CPP.  Figure 5 provides an overview of the CPP
   template.  CPP clauses are elaborated in the following sub-sections.

Internet-Draft                     CPP                    September 2012


2.1.  Customer Nodes or Service Nodes

   A CPP must include the list of Customer Nodes (e.g., CEs) to be
   connected to the underlying IP transport network.

   These nodes should be unambiguously identified (e.g., using a unique
   Service_identifier).  For each Customer Node, a border link or a node
   part of the connectivity domain which is connected to the Customer
   Node should be identified.

   Based on the location of the Customer Node (e.g., CE), appropriate
   operations to retrieve the corresponding border link or "Provider
   Node" (e.g., PE) should be undertaken.  This operation can be manual
   or automated.

   A "service site" would be located behind a given Customer Node.  An
   identifier of the site may also be pertinent to be captured in the
   CPP for the provisioning of managed VPN [RFC4026] for instance (e.g.,
   Site_identifier).

   A Customer Node may be connected to several Provider Nodes and
   multiple Customer Nodes may be connected to the same Provider Node
   (see Figure 3).

2.2.  Scope

   The Scope specifies the connection between involved Customer Nodes.
   It is defined as an unidirectional parameter.  Both directions should
   be described in the CPP.

   The reachability scope may be defined as allowed destination IP
   prefixes that can be reached from the customer site.

   Both IPv4 and IPv6 scopes may be distinguished.

   A "Scope" delimits a topological (or geographical) network portion
   over which the performance and availability guarantees are not valid.

   A scope may be defined by an "Ingress" and "Egress" points.  Several
   types may be envisaged.  Examples are listed below:
      (1) "1:1" Pipe model.  Only point to point communications are
      allowed.
      (2) "1:N" Hose model.  Only communications destined to a set of
      destinations are allowed.
      (3) "1:any" Unspecified hose model.  All outbound communications
      destined to whatever reachable destinations are to be offered.

   A Scope indicating external "Ingress" or "Egress" nodes (i.e., not

   connected to the Provider Network or Customer Network) may also be
   accepted provided that these nodes are unambiguously identified
   (e.g., IPv6 prefix).

2.3.  QoS Guarantees

   QoS guarantees denote a set of IP transfer performance metrics which
   characterize the quality of the IP transfer treatment to be
   experienced (when crossing an IP transport infrastructure) by a flow
   issued or destined to a (set of) "Customer Node(s)".

   IP performance metrics can be expressed as qualitative or
   quantitative parameters.  When quantitative metrics are used, maximum
   or average numerical values are provided together with a validity
   interval which should be indicated in the measurement method.

   Several performance metrics have been defined such as:
   o  Traffic Loss [RFC2680]
   o  One way delay [RFC2679]
   o  One way delay variation [RFC3393]
   The value of these parameters may be specific to a given path or a
   given scope (e.g., between two "Customer Nodes").  Concretely, IP
   performance metric value indicated in a CPP should reflect the
   measurement between a set of "Customer Node" or between a "Customer
   Node" and Provider Nodes attached to the IP network.

   Meta-QoS class concept can be used when qualitative metrics are used
   [RFC5160].

2.4.  Availability Guarantees

   This clause specifies the percentage of the time when the agreed IP
   performance guarantees must be met.  The guarantees cover both QoS
   deterioration (i.e., IP transfer service is available but it is below
   the agreed performance bounds), physical failures or service
   unavailability in general.  In order to meet the availability
   guarantees, several engineering practices may be enforced in the
   border link such as allowing for multi-homed "Customer Nodes".

   The following mechanisms are provided as illustration examples to
   show that several technical choices may be enforced to meet the
   service availability needs:
   o  When an IGP instance is running between the "Customer Node" and
      the "Provider Node", activate a dedicated protocol, such as BFD
      (Bi-directional Forwarding Detection [RFC5881][RFC5883]), to
      control IGP availability and then to ensure sub-second IGP
      adjacency failure detection.

   o  Use of LSP ping capability to detect LSP availability (check if
      the LSP is in place or not) [RFC4379].
   o  Pre-install backup LSPs for fast-rerouting when MPLS is used
      between "Customer Nodes" [RFC4090].
   o  Enable VRRP [RFC5798].
   o  Enable IP Fast Reroute features (e.g., [RFC5286]).

2.5.  Traffic Volume

   This clause characterizes the required capacity to be provided by the
   underlying IP transport network.  This capacity is bound to a defined
   "Scope" (See Section 2.2) and IP transfer performance guarantees (see
   (Section 2.3)and (Section 2.4)).

   Traffic volume may be expressed per border link and for both
   directions (i.e., incoming and outgoing).  It is up to the
   administrative entity, which manages the IP transport network, to
   appropriately dimension its network [RFC5136] to meet the capacity
   requirements expressed in all negotiated CPPs.

2.6.  Conformance Traffic

   When capacity information (see Section 2.5) is included in the CPP,
   out-of-profile traffic would be handled separately.

   Shaping/policing filters may be applied so as to assess wither the
   traffic is within the capacity profile or out of profile.

   Out-of-profile traffic may be discared or under-classed (e.g., using
   the Lower than Best Effort PDB [RFC3662]).

   Conditions on the injected packets MTU may also be indicated in the
   CPP.

2.7.  Traffic Isolation

   This clause indicates if the traffic issued by/destined to "Customer
   Nodes" should be isolated when crossing the IP transport network.

   This clause is then translated into IP engineering policies such as
   activating dedicated tunnels using IPsec or establish BGP/MPLS VPN
   facilities [RFC4364], or a combination thereof.  Activated means
   should be consistent with those used to meet the availability and
   performance guarantees.

   When a "M:N" Scope is defined, optimization should be encouraged and
   not systematically assume a fully meshed tunnel topology.

2.8.  Flow Identification

   To identify the flows that need to be handled in the context of a
   given CPP, flow identifiers should be indicated in the CPP.  This
   identifier is used for traffic classification purposes.

   A flow identifier may be composed of the following parameters:
   o  source IP address,
   o  source port number,
   o  destination IP address,
   o  destination port number,
   o  ToS or DSCP field,
   o  tail-end tunnel endpoint, or
   o  a combination thereof.

   Distinct treatments may be implemented for elastic and non elastic
   traffic (e.g., see the "Constraints on traffic" clause defined in
   [RFC5160]).

   Flow classification rules may be specific to a given link or a given
   rule may be applied for all border links.  This should be clearly
   captured in the CPP.  For incoming traffic, some practices such as
   re-marking the DSCP field should be indicated in CPP.  Re- marking
   action is under the responsibility of IP nodes, but this should be
   inferred by some constraints such as maintaining the service
   transparency (e.g., VPN services).

2.9.  Routing & Forwarding

   When outsourced routing actions are required, dedicated routes may be
   installed so as to convey the traffic to its (service) destination
   and avoiding some nodes (or ASes).

   A requirement to dedicate a logical topology may also be envisaged
   owing to the activation of [RFC4915] or [RFC5120] .

   This practice should be indicated in the CPP, otherwise routing
   actions belong to the underlying IP routing capabilities.  Forwarding
   behavior (e.g., Per Domain Behaviour) may also be specified in a CPP.
   Nevertheless, it is optional.  If indicated, consistency with the IP
   performance bounds defined in the CPP should be carefully ensured.

   In the context of VoIP deployments for instance, a routing policy
   would be to avoid satellite links since this may degrade the offered
   service.

2.10.  Activation Means

   This clause indicates the required action(s) to be undertaken to
   activate access to the IP connectivity service.

   Examples of these actions would be the activation of an IGP instance,
   the establishment of a BGP [RFC4271] or MB-BGP session [RFC4760],
   etc.

2.11.  Invocation Means

   Two types are defined:
   Implicit:  This clause when indicated means that no explicit means to
      invoke the connectivity service is required.  Access to
      connectivity service is conditioned by the requested network
      capacity.
   Explicit:  This clause indicates the need for an explicit means to
      access the connectivity service.  Examples of explicit invocation
      means include the use of RSVP [RFC2205] or RSVP-TE [RFC3209].
      Appropriate access control procedures [RFC6601] would have to be
      enforced to check if the capacity actually used is not above the
      agreed threshold.

2.12.  Notifications

   For operation purposes (e.g., supervision) and service fulfillment
   needs, added value service platforms need to be notified about
   critical events which may impact the delivery of the service.

   The notification procedure should be indicated in the CPP.  This
   procedure may specify the type of information to be sent, the
   interval, data model, etc.

   This may be enforced using SNMP, Syslog notifications, or a phone
   call!


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define an architecture nor specify a protocol.
