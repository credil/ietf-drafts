Abstract

   This document discusses the procedure that helps to identify
   IPv4 embedded IPv6 Multicast address without any embedded
   flags in the address. This document specifies the usage of
   additional data or attribute in MLD and PIM that helps
   identify this address. This document is not conclusive and is
   open for discussion.

1. Introduction

   As part of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, there are multiple
   standards developed for smooth transition for Unicast.
   Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps] specifies

Internet-DraftPIM/MLD flags for IPv4-IPv6 Multicast Translation
Procedure                     June 2012


   different possible scenarios for IPv4 to IPv6 multicast
   transition as below,

      1. IPv4 Receiver and Source connected over IPv6-Only
        network
      2. IPv6 Receiver Connected to IPv4 Source through IPv4
        multicast access network and IPv6 Multicast network.
      3. IPv6 Receiver and Source connected to IPv4-Only network.
      4. IPv6 Receiver and IPv4 Source.
      5. IPv4 Receiver and IPv6 Source.

   Section 3.6 of [I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps] identifies the
   use cases involving IPv4 source as highest priority.

   There are also various solutions proposed (ex., [I-D.ietf-
   softwire-mesh-multicast], [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-
   multicast]) addressing the above use cases requirement which
   requires to embed IPv4 multicast address into IPv6 address.
   This IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address will be used as
   group address within IPv6 cloud.

   Currently [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format]
   defines a new bit in IPv6 Multicast address that signals any
   router that Ipv4 Multicast address is embedded as last 32
   bits. This may create backward compatibility issue.

   This document defines a set of procedures, a new PIM join
   attribute [RFC 5384] and a new MLD Auxiliary Data that helps
   achieve the above without a need for any bit embedded within
   IPv6 Multicast address.



2. Conventions used in this document

   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that
   interpretation   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of
   these words are not to be    interpreted as carrying RFC-2119

Procedure                     June 2012


3. Terminology

   (S4, G4)/(*, G4): (S, G) or (*, G) in IPv4 address format

   (S6, G6)/(*, G6): (S, G) or (*, G) in IPv6 address format

4. Procedure

   Any AFBR on receiving (S4, G4) or (*, G4) PIM join or IGMP
   Report message and if the S6 after translation is not IPv4
   translatable address and if the upstream is IPv6 PIM neighbor
   MUST include transitive 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE (Section 4.1) in
   IPv6 PIM Join and embed IPv4 group address in last 32 bits of
   IPv6 Multicast SSM range address.

   Any AFBR on receiving (S4, G4) or (*, G4) PIM join or IGMP
   Report message and if the S6 after translation is IPv4
   translatable address and if the upstream is IPv6 PIM neighbor
   SHOULD include transitive 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE in IPv6 PIM Join
   and embed IPv4 group address in last 32 bits of IPv6
   Multicast SSM range address.

   Any AFBR on receiving (S4, G4) or (*, G4) PIM Join or IGMP
   Report message and if S6 after translation is not IPv4
   translatable address and if upstream is IPv6 cloud without
   PIM neighbor MUST include 64I Auxiliary Data (Section 4.2) in
   MLDv2 Report Message.

   Any AFBR on receiving (S4, G4) or (*, G4) PIM Join or IGMP
   Report message and if S6 after translation is IPv4
   translatable address and if upstream is IPv6 cloud without
   PIM neighbor SHOULD include 64I Auxillary Data in MLDv2
   Report Message.

   Any AFBR on receiving IPv4 PIM Join with 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE
   MUST carry forward the attribute in IPv6 PIM Join sent
   upstream.

   Any router on receiving IPv6 PIM Join with 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE
   and if upstream is IPv6 cloud without PIM neighbor MUST
   include 64I Auxillary Data in MLDv2 Report message.

   Any AFBR on receiving (S6, G6) PIM Join for SSM range address
   without 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE and if the IPv6 Source in Join is
   well known prefix (64:FF9B::/96) or IPv4 translatable IPv6

   address [RFC 6052] and if the upstream is IPv4 PIM neighbor,
   MUST pull the last 32 bits to generate IPv4 group address.

   Any router on receiving (S6, G6) PIM Join from SSM range
   without 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE and if Source address is well
   known prefix (64:FF9B::/96) or IPv4 translatable IPv6 address
   [RFC 6052] and if the upstream is IPv6 PIM neighbor, MUST
   include 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE.

   Any router on receiving MLD Report with 64I Auxiliary Data
   MUST include 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE in IPv6 PIM join sent
   Upstream for the group.

   While the above procedure is defined with SSM range address
   as an example, it is applicable for any (S6, G6) from ASM
   range.

Procedure                     June 2012


   AFBR1 on receiving (S4, G4) or (*, G4) PIM Join or IGMP
   Report will perform the below,



      1. If Upstream is IPv6 PIM neighbor, should embed the IPv4
        multicast group into last 32 bits of IPv6 Multicast SSM
        range address and send (S6, G6) PIM join with 64I JOIN
        ATTRIBUTE.
      2. If Upstream is IPv6 MLD router, should embed the IPv4
        multicast group into last 32 bits of IPv6 Multicast SSM
        range address and send MLDv2 Report with 64I Auxillary
        Data.

   AFBR2 on receiving (S6, G6) PIM Join without 64I JOIN
   ATTRIBUTE and if upstream is IPv4 cloud can derive the IPv4
   multicast group address from last 32 bits.



   Since F bit will be set in 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE, it will be
   delivered to AFBR2 even if any router along the path doesn't
   understand the attribute.

   IPv6-only Rtr on receiving (S6, G6) PIM Join with 64I JOIN
   ATTRIBUTE will send across to AFBR2 with attribute. Since 64I
   JOIN ATTRIBUTE is transitive in nature, this behavior doesn't
   change even if IPv6-Only Rtr doesn't understand the
   attribute.

   IPv6-only Rtr on receiving (S6, G6) MLD Report with 64I
   Auxiliary Data will include 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE in upstream
   PIM join for (S6, G6).

   AFBR2 on receiving (S6, G6) PIM Join with 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE
   must derive the IPv4 multicast group address from the last 32
   bits.

                     Figure 2: 6-4-6-4 Scenario



   In Figure 2, AFBR3 will act as IP/ICMP translator and will
   advertise IPv4 prefixes into IPv6 cloud as either well known
   prefix (64:FF9B::/96) or IPv4 translatable IPv6 prefix.

   In this scenario, AFBR1 or the DR router MUST include 64I
   JOIN ATTRIBUTE or 64I Auxiliary Data if the source is well
   known prefix (64:FF9B::/96).  AFBR1 or the DR router SHOULD
   include 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE or 64I Auxiliary Data if the
   source is with IPv4 translatable IPv6 prefix. How AFBR1/DR
   will understand if S6 belongs to IPv4 translatable IPv6
   prefix is outside the scope of this document.

   Various solutions are available by which AFBR1 will send the
   join towards AFBR2. This basically depends if multicast is
   enabled or disabled on IPv4 cloud. Depending on the solution,

   AFBR1 will either send IPv6 PIM Join encapsulated within IPv4
   PIM join or IPv6 PIM Join over some tunnel.

   AFBR2 on receiving (S6, G6) PIM Join over tunnel or (S6, G6)
   PIM Join encapsulated within (S4, G4) will send 64I JOIN
   ATTRIBUTE or 64I Auxiliary Data upstreams towards AFBR3.

   AFBR3 on receiving (S6, G6) Join with 64I JOIN ATTRIBUTE MUST
   derive the IPv4 group address from last 32 bits.

   AFBR3 on receiving (S6, G6) PIM join without 64I JOIN
   ATTRIBUTE MUST check if S6 falls within well known prefix
   (64:FF9B::/96) or IPv4 translatable IPv6 Prefix. If S6 is
   within the above range, it MUST derive IPv4 group from the
   last 32 bits of G6.
