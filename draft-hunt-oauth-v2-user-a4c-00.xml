    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines a new OAuth2 endpoint that enables user
      authentication session information to be shared with client
      applications.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Section 4.1 of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework <xref
      target="RFC6749"/> defines the "Authorization Code Grant" flow which
      defines a redirect flow, typically via a web browser, that enables
      confidential clients to obtain access and refresh tokens. As part of
      this flow, resource owners are authenticated via the user agent so that
      their consent may be obtained. This flow defines the "Authentication
      Code Grant" extension which enables clients to request re-authentication
      and makes authentication session information available to the client in
      a standardized format.</t>

      <t>This document focuses on extending OAuth2 to provide authentication
      session information only. The specification does not define a
      standardized resource owner profile information API. It is assumed that
      other APIs such as the SCIM API could be used for this purpose. As part
      of the session information, a subject profile URL may optionally be
      provided.</t>

      <t>This specification is meant to be an authentication only minimum
      profile of OpenID Foundation's Connect <xref target="OIDC"/>
      specification. Where OpenID is intended to define a full user profile
      service, this specification focuses exclusively on providing
      authentication only and can be used in conjunction with any service
      provider resource service. Where possible, parameters that are the same
      have been made equivalent or the same. Implementers of this
      specification should also consider using OIDC as a standardized identity
      profile service.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="AuthenticateGrant" title="Authenticate Code Grant">
      <t>The Authentication Code Grant type is used in exactly the same manor
      as the Authorization Code Grant <xref target="RFC6749">Section
      4.1</xref> and has the same features and conditions. The Authorization
      Code Grant extends the features available by making it possible for
      clients to test and request re-authenticaiton and authorization as well
      as obtain login session information at the end of the grant flow.</t>

      <section anchor="Authentication_Request" title="Authentication Request">
        <t>In addition to the parameters defined in <xref
        target="RFC6749">Section 4.1.1</xref>, the following additional
        parameters are defined:<list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="prompt"><vspace blankLines="0"/>OPTIONAL. Space
            delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII string values that
            specifies whether the Authorization Server prompts the End-User
            for reauthentication and consent. The defined values are:<list
                hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
                <t hangText="none">The Authorization Server MUST NOT display
                any authentication or consent user interface pages. An error
                is returned if the End-User is not already authenticated or
                the Client does not have pre-configured consent for the
                requested Claims or does not fulfill other conditions for
                processing. This can be used as a method to check for existing
                authentication and/or consent.</t>

                <t hangText="login">The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the
                End-User for reauthentication. If it cannot prompt the
                End-User, it MUST return an error.</t>

                <t hangText="consent">The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt
                the End-User for consent before returning information to the
                Client.</t>

                <t hangText="select_account">The Authorization Server SHOULD
                prompt the End-User to select a user account. This allows an
                End-User who has multiple accounts at the Authorization Server
                to select amongst the multiple accounts that they might have
                current sessions for. If it cannot prompt the End-User, it
                MUST return an error.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t hangText="display">OPTIONAL. ASCII string value that specifies
            how the Authorization Server displays the authentication and
            consent user interface pages to the End-User. The defined values
            are:<list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
                <t hangText="page">The Authorization Server SHOULD display
                authentication and consent UI consistent with a full
                User-Agent page view. If the display parameter is not
                specified this is the default display mode.</t>

                <t hangText="popup">The Authorization Server SHOULD display
                authentication and consent UI consistent with a popup
                User-Agent window. The popup User-Agent window SHOULD be 450
                pixels wide and 500 pixels tall.</t>

                <t hangText="touch">The Authorization Server SHOULD display
                authentication and consent UI consistent with a device that
                leverages a touch interface. The Authorization Server MAY
                attempt to detect the touch device and further customize the
                interface.</t>

                <t hangText="wap">The Authorization Server SHOULD display
                authentication and consent UI consistent with a "feature
                phone" type display.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t hangText="hint"><vspace blankLines="0"/>OPTIONAL. A helpful
            text message that should be displayed to the user during a
            re-authentication or re-authorization process.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For xample, the client directs the user-agent to make the following
        HTTP request using TLS (with extra line breaks for display purposes
        only):<figure>

        associated resource API and an access token is not to be issued, the
        normal OAuth2 token request is still made.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Access Token Response">
        <t>If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
        authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh token
        as described in <xref target="RFC6749">Section 5.1</xref>with the
        exception that the issuance of access_token is OPTIONAL. If the
        request client authentication failed or is invalid, the authorization
        server returns an error response as described in Section 5.2.</t>

        <t>In addition to the parameters described in Section 5, a new
        "session" parameter or "session_token" is returned containing the

            <t anchor="sub" hangText="sub">REQUIRED. An identifier for the
            authenicated subject. The same identifier MUST be return for the

            user's "sub" value MAY change for different client_id values.</t>

            <t anchor="sub_url" hangText="sub_url">OPTIONAL. A URL which can
            be used to access the authenticated subject user profile data. The
            URL MUST point to the same user profile as the one that was
            authenticated. The URL MUST be valid for the duration of the
            associated access token and refresh_tokens lifetimes.</t>

            <t hangText="lat">REQUIRED. The time at which the subject user was
            authenticated expressed in number of seconds from

            date/times in general and UTC in particular. Note "expires_in"
            referes to the normal access token lifespan whereas "exp" refers

            client_id of the client receiving the assertion.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Any claims, whether in the session parameter or the session token
        defined above MUST be understood before proceeding. Additional
        claims/parameters that are not understood MUST be ignored.</t>

        <t>The client MUST confirm the "lat" is not future dated and "exp" is
        not a date currently in the past.</t>

        <t>If an assurance level (alv) is to be returned higher than "2", then
