Abstract

   This document defines an extension to certificates according to
   [RFC5280]. The extension defined in this document holds data about
   how the certificate subject was authenticated by the Certification
   Authority who issued the certificate where this extension appears. 

   This document also defines one data structure for inclusion in this
   extension that designed to hold information when the subject is
   authenticated using a SAML assertion [SAML].

INTERNET DRAFT      Authentication Context Extension   February 15, 2013


1  Introduction

   This document addresses some needs that may arise when issuing a
   certificate from an existing non-certificate based identity
   infrastructure where the certificate subject already has an
   authenticated identity composed of a set of attributes, or so called
   claims, that differ from the attributes that are commonly used to
   express the identity of a certificate subject.

   A typical scenario for this is when the basic trust infrastructure is
   based on a SAML federation, where the subject for some reason needs a
   certificate that can be traced back to that subjects SAML
   credentials, both with regard to identity and with regard to level of
   assurance with which the subject has been authenticated.

   A reason to issue such certificate may arise if the subject needs a
   certificate to support signing a document, where the Certification
   Authority is authenticating the user by means of the SAML federation
   when issuing that signature certificate.

   If that signature certificate need to conform to certificate
   profiles, such as [RFC3739], then this certificate may have to use a
   separate set of attributes to express the subject identity than the
   set of attributes obtained from the SAML assertion.

   The extension defined in the document makes it possible to extract
   information about the authentication context applied when
   authenticating the subject for the purpose of issuing a certificate.
   This may include information such as:

     o  The Identity Provider which authenticated the subject.
     o  The level of assurance with which the subject was authenticated.
     o  The trust framework where this level of assurance was defined.
     o  A unique reference to the authentication instant
     o  A mapping table between the subject attributes obtained from the
        SAML assertion used to authenticate the subject, and the subject
        identity information placed in the issued certificate.

   One scenario where this information may be useful is when a user logs
   in to a service using SAML credentials, where the same user at some
   stage is required to sign some information. The service may need to
   verify that the signature was created by the same user that logged on
   to the service. This is only possible today using out-of-band
   knowledge about the CA that issued the certificate and it's
   practices. This is is however hard to scale and maintain using a
   large number of service providers, identity providers and CAs.

INTERNET DRAFT      Authentication Context Extension   February 15, 2013


   The defined extension provides better scalability since it only
   requires the service provider to maintain a list of trusted CA:s. All
   other information abut the relationship between the certificate
   subject, and the SAML authenticated subject is available in the
   certificate.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2  Deployment

   EDITORS NOTE:
      [This section provided information for better understanding the
      rationale of the extension. This section can be deleted is the
      document is published]

   The extension defined in this draft has been defined and deployed in
   the National Swedish Identity infrastructure Eid 2.0 which is based
   on SAML federated identity. The Swedish infrastructure will go live
   during 2013 and will provide secure identification of citizens in
   Swedish government services. A central requirement in these
   government services is to allow citizens to sign various documents,
   representing a wide range of declarations and applications.

   A central part of this infrastructure is therefore to use centralized
   signature services that allows citizens to sign using their SAML
   credentials. As service providers authenticate and understands user
   identities only under a SAML context within this national
   infrastructure, this extension allows Service Providers to determine
   whether a presented signature matches a particular user and whether
   it meets the security requirements of the service.

   Through information provided in this extension a service provider may
   for example get notice that the user logged on using one level of
   assurance, but presented a signature which certificate was issued
   using a certificate obtained using a lower level of assurance
   procedure, and thus reject the signature. 

   This extension is therefore fundamental to the function of the
   Swedish Eid 2.0 infrastructure.

2.  Authentication Context Extension Syntax

   The Authentication Context extension has the following syntax:

      AuthenticationContexts ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                                 AuthenticationContext

      AuthenticationContext ::= SEQUENCE {
          contextType   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
          mimeType	  PrintableString OPTIONAL,
          contextInfo   OCTET STRING
      }


   This extension holds a sequence of AuthenticationContext information.
   When present, this extension MUST include at least one
   AuthenticationContext.

   The type of authentication context information included in
   AuthenticationContext is identified by the contextType object
   identifier. The authentication context information is carried in
   contextInfo using a data format that is identified by the specified
   mimeType.

   If mimeType is absent, then contextInfo MUST hold a DER encoded ASN.1
   structure.

   This document defines one authentication context information type
   identified by the contextType object identifier (Section 3) that is
   used to provide information about SAML based authentication. Other
   documents can define other authentication context information types.
   Each information type MUST define both data format and structure of
   the data stored in contextInfo.

   Applications which find an authentication context information type
   they do not understand MUST ignore it. If an application requires
   that an authentication context exist, and either the extension is
   absent or none of the provided authentication contexts can be used
   MUST fail validation of the end user certificate.

   This extension MAY be marked critical.

3  SAML Authentication Context Information

   The SAML Authentication context information provides a contextType
   type that can be used to carry information about SAML based
   authentication of the certified subject as part of the certificate
   issuing process.

INTERNET DRAFT      Authentication Context Extension   February 15, 2013


   The data carried in this authentication context information type is
   provided in JSON format, identified by the following mime type:

      application/json

   This data structure is identified by the contextType Object
   Identifier id-ct-saml-ac.

      id-ct-saml-ac     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-eleg-ct 1}

   The JSON data format is used mainly to allow this context information
   to be extracted and processed in applications that lacks ASN.1
   processing capabilities. JSON is easy to deserialize into various
   data objects both in application and web environments for further
   comparison with the characteristics of SAML authenticated sessions. 

   The data provided in contextInfo SHALL be the byte representation of
   an UTF-8 encoded string holding JSON formatted data in accordance
   with Appendix B. The content of the two JSON objects authContextInfo
   and idAttributes are outlined in the following subsections.

3.1   authContextInfo object

   The authContextInfo object MAY be present in the statement. When
   present, the following conventions SHALL apply to the parameters
   carried in the authContext object:

     identityProvider       (required): The SAML EntityID of the
                            Identity Provider which authenticated the
                            subject.
     authenticationInstant  (required): Date and time when the subject
                            was authenticated.
     authnContextClassRef   (required): A URI identifying the

                            used to authenticate the subject. This URI
                            identifies the context and the level of
                            assurance associated with this instance of
                            authentication.
     assertionRef           (optional): A unique reference to the SAML
                            Assertion
     serviceID              (optional): An arbitrary identifier of the
                            service that verified the SAML assertion.

3.2  idAttributes object

   The idAttributes object MAY be present in the statement. When
   present, this object holds an array of attribute statements, where
   each object in the array holds information about one SAML attribute
   value that was included in the certificate as a representation of the
   certified subject.

   When present, each attribute statement SHALL comply with the
   following conventions:

     name           (Optional): An arbitrary friendly name of the
                    attribute.
     samlAttr       (Required): A URI identifying the SAML attribute
                    that contained the value in attrVlaue.
     attrValue      (Required): The attribute value carried in the SAML
                    attribute.
     certNameType   (Required): A string holding one of the enumerated
                    values "rdn", "san" or "sda", having the following

                      "rdn"   The attribute value is placed in the
                              subject field of the certificate in a
                              present Relative Distinguished Name
                              attribute.
                      "san"   The attribute value is placed in the
                              Subject Alternative Name extension of the
                              certificate.
                      "sda"   The attribute value is stored an a Subject
                              Directory Attributes extension.

     certRef        (Required): A reference to the corresponding
                    attribute or name field where the attribute value is
                    stored in the certificate. The certRef holds a
                    string value which is dependent on the value of
                    certNameType. The value of certRef MUST contain the
                    following information when the value of certNameType
                    is;

                      "rdn"   A string representation of the OID of the
                              attribute that holds the corresponding
                              attribute value in the subject field.
                      "sda"   A string representation of the OID of the
                              attribute that holds the corresponding

                              type (e.g. "1" = e-mail address
                              (rfc822Name) and "2" = dNSName). If the
                              SubjectAlternative name is an otherName,
                              then the certRef holds a string
                              representation of the OID defining the
                              otherName form.

   String representations of object identifiers (OID) MUST be
   represented by a sequence of integers separated by a period. E.g.
   "2.5.4.32". This string MUST NOT contain any white-space or line
   breaks.

   The SAML attributes name (in samlAttr) is represented in URI form as
   defined in the [SAML] standard. This URI MAY express an OID. When
   this parameter holds an OID it MUST be represented by a string that
   starts with "urn:oid:" and ends with a string representation of the
   OID (e.g. "urn:oid:2.5.4.42").

3  Security Considerations

   This extension allows a CA to outsource the process to identify and
   authenticate a subject to another trust infrastructure in a dynamic
   manner that may differ form certificate to certificate. Since the
   authentication context is explicitly declared in the certificate, one
   certificate may be issued with a lower level of assurance than
   another.

   This means that the relying party need to be aware of the certificate
   policy under which this CA operates in order to understand when the
   certificate provides a level of assurance with regard to subject
   authentication that is higher than the lowest provided level. A
   relying party that is not capable of understanding the information in
   the authentication context extension MUST assume that the certificate
   is issued using the lowest allowed level of assurance declared by the
   policy.

B.2  JAVA Class Declaration

   This section defines the content of the SAML Authentication Context
   data structure using Java Syntax. The JSON string is obtained by
   serializing an object of the class SAMLAuthContext to JSON. 

   These Java classes only defines structure, but not whether a
   particular element is mandatory or optional. Requirements on
   mandatory or optionally elements is provided in section 3 as well as
   in the JSON schema provided in section B.1.
