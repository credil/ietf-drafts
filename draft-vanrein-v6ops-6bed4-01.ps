(Abstract) N
() N
(   The intention of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only applications, even on) N
(   IPv4-only networks.  A specific area of concern is that of peer-to-) N
(   peer protocols such as SIP or document exchange during a chat) N
(   session.  Such protocols are designed to run in any environment,) N
(   which means that they cannot rely on IPv6 for themselves, or their) N
(   peers.  The 6bed4 tunnel mechanism ensures that IPv6 can be assumed) N
(   on all peers, without a need to configure it explicitly.) N
() N
(   The 6bed4 mechanism is meant as a fallback mechanism for IPv6) N
(   connectivity on networks that do not support it natively, by running) N
(   a tunnel over UDP and IPv4.  The IPv4 address is used to support) N
(   traceability of the traffic originator, which means that no user) N
(   account or other configuration is needed.) N
() N
(   The tunnel mechanism builds on existing IPv6 mechanisms; it employs) N

(1.  Introduction) N
() N
(   The 6bed4 mechanism is a fallback for networks that have no support) N
(   for IPv6.  It is designed to work without configuration on any) N
(   network that is not secured beyond common defaults.  It works behind) N
(   any sequence of Network Address Translating \(NAT\) devices and) N
(   Firewalls, and it does not require support \(such as protocol 41\) from) N
(   any of those devices.  The local network may or may not support IPv6) N
(   already; and also upstream network providers may or may not support) N
(   IPv6.  The 6bed4 traffic does not mingle with local IPv6 traffic, so) N
(   it will never raise alarms that monitor native local IPv6 traffic for) N
(   potential IPv6-specific attacks.) N
() N
(   All traffic on the 6bed4 Network is embedded in UDP and IPv4.  The) N
(   6bed4 Network is thereby layered on top of the IPv4 Internet.  Common) N
(   default configurations for NAT and firewalls support UDP [RFC3022]) N
(   [RFC4787], as long as the communication is initiated internally.) N
(   This is precisely what 6bed4 does.) N
() N
(   This traffic is exchanged between 6bed4 Peers, which are the) N
(   endpoints in the communication.  They may pass their traffic through) N
(   a 6bed4 Router.  A 6bed4 Router recognizes 6bed4 traffic because it) N
(   is received on the standard UDP port TBD1, and it recognizes IPv6) N
(   addresses as 6bed4 addresses because they start with the /64 prefix) N
(   that it has dedicated to 6bed4.  Such IPv6 prefixes are paired to the) N
(   IPv4 address and UDP port of the 6bed4 Router.) N
() N
(   The IPv4 address and UDP port as seen from the Internet are combined) N
(   to form a link-layer address, from which an Interface Identifier is) N
(   constructed in the same way as for Ethernet Networks [RFC2464].  This) N
(   implies that the IPv4 address and UDP port are shown as part of the) N
(   IPv6 address.  This supports traceback of a traffic originator in) N
(   case of abuse, without a need to register accounts or login to them.) N
(   Every 6bed4 Router validate that the IPv4 address and UDP port in the) N
(   IPv6 address against the actual traffic, so the properties of egress) N
(   filtering on IPv4 packets are inherited by the 6bed4 Network.) N
() N
(   The simplest mode of communication between to 6bed4 Peers is to) N
(   communicate through a 6bed4 Router.  This service relays between) N
(   6bed4 traffic and native IPv6 or, if both IPv6 addresses are IPv6) N
(   addresses under the same 6bed4 prefix, then a 6bed4 Router relays the) N
(   traffic between the 6bed4 Peers, using its own IPv4 address and UDP) N
(   port when forwarding a packet over 6bed4 to the destination.  Traffic) N
(   intended for addresses that the 6bed4 Router does not handle as 6bed4) N
(   prefixes are relayed as IPv6 over normal IPv6 routes.) N
() N
(   It is normal for a 6bed4 Peer to attempt to bypass the 6bed4 Router) N
(   by contacting remote peers directly.  One such bypass that every) N

(   6bed4 Peer MUST attempt is to contact 6bed4 Peers at the IPv4 address) N
(   and UDP port contained in their Interface Identifier.  Other) N
(   bypassing mechanisms may also be tried; the success or failure of) N
(   each bypass method depends on co-operation of intermediate network) N
(   nodes.  Rather than devising a model of these intermediate nodes,) N
(   6bed4 Peers simply try to send Neighbor Solicitation over a candidate) N
(   bypass, and when the remote 6bed4 Peer replies with a matching) N
(   Neighbor Advertisement, then the bypass is fit for use.  If the reply) N
(   does not arrive, the 6bed4 Peer can still fallback to the 6bed4) N
(   Router for that remote 6bed4 Peer.) N
() N
(   Information about bypasses to a 6bed4 Peer should be cached for some) N
(   time.  A good place to do this is the Neighbor Cache, which retains) N
(   such information for tens of seconds [RFC4861].  This happens) N
(   automatically if the IPv6 stack that uses a 6bed4 Link for IPv6) N
(   connectivity is used to relay link-layer addresses for the 6bed4) N
(   Network; such link-layer addresses would be composed of the IPv4) N
(   address and UDP port needed to contact the 6bed4 Peer over the 6bed4) N
(   Network.  Whenever the IPv6 stack sends a Neighbor Solicitation down) N
(   the 6bed4 Link, the 6bed4 Peer will know that it should try a number) N
(   of bypasses for that route, once again using Neighbor Discovery.) N
(   When no bypasses work, then the link-local address of the 6bed4) N
(   Router is passed back up to the IPv6 stack.) N

(   prefix to 6bed4 and back.  The IPv6 prefix forms a pair with the) N
(   router's IPv4 address and UDP port for 6bed4.  A 6bed4 Router may) N
(   translate traffic bidirectionally, or in the case of more advanced) N
(   routing topologies, it could rest on the assumption that another) N
(   6bed4 Router to perform the reverse translation for the same pair of) N
(   IPv6 prefix and IPv4/UDP coordinates.) N

(   A 6bed4 Peer is a communication endpoint that uses 6bed4 to embed) N
(   IPv6 packets in UDP and IPv4.  It has a relationship to one 6bed4) N

(   The link-layer address of a 6bed4 Link is not normally known as soon) N
(   as the 6bed4 Link is created, as it relies on observations made on) N
(   the Public Internet.  To obtain this link-layer address, the 6bed4) N
(   Tunnel will send a Router Solicitation to its 6bed4 Router.  The) N
(   6bed4 Router responds with a Router Advertisement containing the) N
(   6bed4 Peer's Interface Identifier as the IPv6 destination address.) N
(   From this address, the 6bed4 Peer's link-layer address is derived and) N
(   assigned to the 6bed4 Link; this also serves as the 6bed4 Link-Layer) N
(   Address when communicating on the 6bed4 Network.  This information is) N
(   usually be exchanged prior to bringing up the 6bed4 Link.) N
() N
(   The prefix information from the Router Advertisement is held back) N
(   until the IPv6 stack on top of the 6bed4 Link sends a Router) N
(   Solicitation.  In response to that, a Router Advertisement is sent to) N
(   the IPv6 stack that holds the prefix.  The IPv6 stack is assumed to) N
(   reconstruct the Interface Identifier from the link-layer address,) N
(   prefix it with the Router Solicitation's prefix and assign the) N
(   resulting address to the 6bed4 Link.  Any attempts to perform) N
(   Neighbor Discovery on its own address should be dropped in the 6bed4) N
(   Tunnel, as it is safe to assume that no competition for the link-) N
(   layer address and its derived full address exists.) N

(   The 6bed4 Link is now configured with a /64 prefix and a default) N
(   route through the 6bed4 Router.  Any IPv6 addresses starting with the) N
(   /64 prefix handled by the 6bed4 Router are treated by the IPv6 stack) N
(   as local traffic to be contacted through the 6bed4 Link, and any) N
(   other IPv6 traffic may be forwarded to the 6bed4 Router.) N
() N
(   Whenever the IPv6 stack needs to find either the 6bed4 Router or a) N

(   The description below assumes that the 6bed4 Router acts bidirection-) N
(   ally; note that a split of this function over multiple network nodes) N
(   is thinkable, in which case their combined behavior should match) N
(   these specifications.) N
() N
(5.1.  Address Information) N
() N
(   A 6bed4 Router offers its services on an IPv4 address and the UDP) N
(   port TBD1.  The IPv4 address varies between 6bed4 Routers, and may be) N
(   found through various means; it may be hard-coded into 6bed4 Tunnel) N
(   software, it may be an Anycast address [RFC4786], or it may be found) N
(   through IPv4 application protocols such as DNS [RFC1034] or DHCP) N
(   [RFC2131].  The combined IPv4 address and UDP port form its 6bed4) N
(   Address, which will sometimes be represented as its 6bed4 Link-Local) N
(   Address.) N
() N
(   Traffic arriving at this UDP/IPv4 combination is said to have arrived) N
(   from the 6bed4 Network.  Similarly, whenever the 6bed4 Router sends) N
(   traffic over the 6bed4 Network, so when addressing a 6bed4 Peer, it) N
(   MUST send from that same IPv4 address and UDP port.) N
() N
(   The IPv4 address and UDP port are paired with a IPv6 /64 prefix for) N
(   which the 6bed4 Router serves as a router.  The prefix is assumed to) N
(   be assigned indefinitely to the 6bed4 Router.) N
() N
(5.2.  Relaying Plain Unicast Traffic) N
() N
(   The 6bed4 Router relays plain unicast traffic between 6bed4 Peers, as) N
(   well as between 6bed4 Peers and the general IPv6 Internet.  This sec-) N
(   tion describes how this is done.) N
() N
(   Upon arrival of plain unicast traffic over the 6bed4 Network, the) N
(   6bed4 Router MUST validate that the sender's IPv6 address is correct;) N
(   this means that the /64 prefix MUST match the prefix serviced by the) N
(   6bed4 Router, and that the IPv4 address and UDP port as shown in the) N
(   Interface Identifier MUST match the parameters of the incoming 6bed4) N
(   message.  This certifies the IPv6 address of the 6bed4 Peer as well) N
(   as its IPv4 address is certified.  The value of the bytes 0xff and) N
(   0xfe in the default Interface Identifier MUST NOT be validated, as) N
(   these may vary when the sending 6bed4 Peer acts as a local router.) N
() N
(   If only the Interface Identifier fails validation, then the 6bed4) N
(   Router MUST proceed as if it had received a Router Solicitation over) N
(   the 6bed4 Network.  The 6bed4 Router MUST drop all other 6bed4 traf-) N
(   fic that fails validation.  The remainder of this section applies) N
(   only to plain unicast traffic that passed validation.) N

() N
(   The 6bed4 mechanism has been carefully designed to work behind any) N
(   sequence of Firewalls or Network Address Translators.  The reason) N
(   that it handles these well has two causes: First, it uses UDP, which) N
(   is an opaque carrier that is generally supported by these devices.) N
(   Second, the traffic is internally initiated, by sending a Router) N
(   Solicitation to a 6bed4 Router.  This is the direction in which both) N
(   Firewalls and NAT open a hole that permits return traffic.) N
() N
(   Since UDP is stateless, all holes in Firewalls and NAT are subject to) N
(   timeouts, and therefore regular traffic is needed to keep such holes) N
(   open.  To this end, a message may be sent to the 6bed4 Router at a) N
(   regular interval, if no other traffic has been sent.  In cases where) N
(   this fails, an outgoing message will be corrected with a new Router) N
(   Advertisement revealing the new 6bed4 Link-Local Address of the 6bed4) N
(   Peer.  If this happens, any communication partners would conclude) N
(   that the 6bed4 Peer had gone offline; regular traffic may be pre-) N
(   ferred to avoid this.) N
() N
(   It may be beneficial to support 6bed4 on servers or routers, even if) N
(   they are connected through native IPv6.  This could help to have more) N
(   direct connectivity to popular 6bed4 Networks.  If server nodes are) N
(   located behind a sequence of Firewalls and/or NAT, then Port Forward-) N
(   ing may be setup explicitly to fixate an IPv6 address, by avoiding) N
(   UDP port changes.  When this is done, the IPv6 address could safely) N

() N
(8.  Security Considerations) N
() N
(   The 6bed4 protocol uses configuration packets that were designed for) N
(   local network use, but it employs them on the public Internet.  This) N
(   is not a change to be made lightly.  Furthermore, 6bed4 is a tunnel) N
(   protocol, which itself implies certain responsibilities.) N
() N
(   All tunnel protocols should reject forged inner addresses; the 6bed4) N
(   Peer and 6bed4 Router tackle this by validating the address informa-) N
(   tion upon entry; the IPv6 source address must match with the IPv4) N
(   address and UDP port from which the packet originated.  The only) N
(   exception is the Router Advertisement sent to the 6bed4 Router, but) N
(   this is a mindful choice, and the packet is not permitted to travel) N
(   beyond the 6bed4 Router.) N
() N
(   The link between an IPv4 address \(which is hopefully subjected to) N
(   egress filtering\) and the tunnel's inner IPv6 address means that it) N
(   is not easier to forge an IPv6 address than it is to forge an IPv4) N
(   address.  Furthermore, the use of an IPv4 address as part of the IPv6) N
(   address means that network attackers are as traceable on a 6bed4 Net-) N
(   work as they are on the IPv4 network.) N
() N
(   This specification does not introduce anything that could cause a) N
(   6bed4 Peer to contact a wrong 6bed4 Router; the mechanism for deter-) N
(   mining the IPv4 address for that service falls outside the scope of) N
(   this specification.) N
() N
(   Special attention is warranted for the Neighbor Advertisement and) N
(   Router Advertisement messages, as these announce information that) N
(   influences message redirection of a 6bed4 Peer.  These concerns are) N
(   addressed by the precaution to validate source addresses.  In addi-) N
(   tion, the information claimed is validated as per the behavioral) N
(   specifications given above.) N
() N
(   Another specific concern relates to the ability to send Redirect) N
(   packets.  Once again, validation on source addresses addresses these) N
(   concerns.  In addition, the packet is only a hint and not an update) N
(   instruction.  When it is received, a Neighbor Solicitation process) N
(   will only commence if the targeted 6bed4 Peer is already known to the) N
(   6bed4 Peer.  This process is predictable, so a Neighbor Advertisement) N
(   could be crafted ahead of time; however, these Neighbor Advertise-) N
(   ments are also subject to matching of the source address.) N
() N
(   In summary, the risks caused by the tunneling technique and the use) N
(   of Neighbor Discovery style packets on the 6bed4 Network are limited) N
(   to situations where it is possible to send traffic from forged IPv4) N
(   address.  In such situations, the problems are much more general and) N
(   serious.) N
