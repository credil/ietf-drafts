Internet-Draft              NAT64 Deployment                January 2013


1.  Introduction

   With IANA's global IPv4 address pool was exhausted, IPv6 is the only
   sustainable solution for numbering nodes on the Internet.  Network
   operators have to deploy IPv6-only networks in order to meet the
   numbering needs of the expanding internet without available IPv4
   addresses.

   As IPv6 deployment continues, IPv6 networks and hosts will need to
   coexist with IPv4 numbered resources.  The Internet will include
   nodes that are dual-stack, nodes that remain IPv4-only, and nodes
   that can be deployed as IPv6-only nodes.

   Single stack IPv6 network deployment can simplify the network
   provisioning.  Some justifications have been described in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-464xlat].  IPv6-only networks confer some benefits to
   mobile operators employing them.  In the mobile context, it enables
   the use of a single IPv6 PDP(Packet Data Protocol), which eliminates
   significant network cost caused by doubling the PDP count on a mass
   of legacy mobile terminals.  In broadband networks overall, it can
   allow for the scaling of edge-network growth decoupled from IPv4
   numbering limitations.

   In a transition scenario, an existing network may rely on the IPv4
   stack for a long time.  There is also the troublesome trend of access
   network providers squatting on IPv4 address space that they do not
   own.  Allowing for interconnection between IPv4-only nodes and IPv6-
   only nodes is a critical capability.  Widespread dual-stack
   deployments have not materialized at the anticipated rate over the
   last 10 years, one possible conclusion being that legacy networks
   will not make the jump quickly.  A translation mechanism based on a
   NAT64[RFC6146] function will be a key element of the internet
   infrastructure supporting such legacy networks.

   [RFC6036] reported at least 30% operators plan to run some kind of
   translator (presumably NAT64/DNS64).  Advice on NAT64 deployment and
   operation is therefore of some importance.  [RFC6586] documented the
   implications for ipv6 only networks.  This document intends to be
   specific to NAT64 network planning.

   In regards to IPv4/IPv6 translation, [RFC6144] has described a
   framework of enabling networks to make interworking possible between
   IPv4-only and IPv6-only networks.  This document has further
   categorized different NAT64 location and use case.  The principle
   distinction of location is if the NAT64 is located in a NAT64-CGN
   (Carrier Grade NATs) or NAT64-FE (server Front End).

2.  Terminology

   The terms of NAT-CGN/FE are understood to be a topological
   distinction indicating different features employed in a NAT64
   deployment.

   NAT64-CGN:  A NAT64-CGN (Carrier Grade NATs) is placed in an ISP
      network.  IPv6 only subscribers leverage the NAT64-CGN to access
      existing IPv4 internet services.  The ISP as an administrative
      entity takes full control on the IPv6 side, but has limited or no
      control on the IPv4 side.  ISP's should attempt to accommodate the
      behavior of IPv4 networks and services.

   NAT64-FE:  A NAT64-FE (server Front End) is generally a traffic load
      balancer with NAT64 functionalities in a ICP network.

        Figure 1: NAT64-CGN Scenario: IPv6 Network to IPv4 Internet

3.1.  NAT64-CGN Networking

   The NAT64-CGN use case is employed to connect IPv6-only users to the
   IPv4 Internet.  The NAT64 gateway performs protocol translation from
   an IPv6 packet header to an IPv4 packet header and vice versa
   according to the stateful NAT64 [RFC6146].  Address translation maps
   IPv6 addresses to IPv4 addresses and vice versa for return traffic.

   All connections to the IPv4 Internet from IPv6-only clients must
   traverse the NAT64-CGN.  It is advantageous from the vantage-point of

   troubleshooting and traffic engineering to carry the IPv6 traffic
   natively for as long as possible within an access network and
   translates only at or near the network egress.  In many service
   provider networks, NAT64 is considered feature of the AS boarder.
   This allows consistent attribution and traceability within the
   service provider network.  Meaning, within one network, the packet
   only has one source.  As the packet leaves the network destine for
   another network, the packet source may be translated as needed.

   In mobile networks, various possibilities can be envisaged to deploy
   the NAT64 function.  Whichever option is selected, the NAT64 function
   will be deployed beyond the GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) or
   PDN-GW (Public Data Network-Gateway), i.e. first IP node in currently
   deployed mobile architectures.

   In a given implementation, NAT64 functionality can be provided by
   either a dedicated device or an multifunction gateway with integrated
   NAT64 functionality.  If NAT64 is integrated into an existing node,
   capacities of existing nods can be potentially limited by the new
   functionality, e.g. maximum concurrent connections.  In a mobile
   context, the NAT64 function likely be implemented in a firewall,
   which is the first hop routed from GGSN/PGW.

3.2.  High Availability Considerations

   High Availability (HA) is a major requirement for every service.

   Two mechanisms are typically used to achieve high availability, i.e.
   cold-standby and hot-standby.  Cold-standby systems have synchronized
   configuration and mechanism to failover traffic between the hot and
   cold systems such as VRRP [RFC5798] .  Unlike hot-standby, cold-
   standby does not synchronize NAT64 session state.  This makes cold-
   standby less resource intensive and generally simpler, but it
   requires clients to re-establish sessions when a fail-over occurs.
   Hot-standby has all the features of cold-standby but must also
   synchronize the binding information base (BIB).  Given that short
   lived sessions account for most of the bindings, hot-standby does not
   offer much benefit for those sessions.  Consideration should be given
   to the importance (or lack thereof) of maintaining bindings for long
   lived sessions across failovers.

3.3.  Traceability

   Traceablility is required in many cases such as identifying malicious
   attacks sources and accounting requirements.  NAT64 devices are
   required to log events like creation and deletion of translations and
   information about the occupied resources.  There are two different
   demands for traceability,i.e. online or offline.

   o  Regarding the Online requirements, XFF (X-Forwarded-For)
      [I-D.ietf-appsawg-http-forwarded]would be a candidate, it appends
      IPv6 address of subscribers to HTTP headers which is passed on to
      WEB servers, and the querier server can lookup radius servers for
      the target subscribers based on IPv6 addresses included in XFF
      HTTP headers.  X-Forwarded-For is specific to HTTP, requires the
      use of an application aware gateway, cannot in general be applied
      to requests made over HTTPs and cannot be assumed to be preserved
      end-to-end as it may be overwritten by other application-aware
      proxies such as load balancers.

   o  Some potential solutions to online traceability are explore in
      [I-D.ietf-intarea-nat-reveal-analysis].

   o  A NAT64-CGN could also deliver NAT64 sessions (BIB and STE) to a
      Radius server by extension of the radius protocol.  Such an
      extension is an alternative solution for online traceability,
      particularly high performance would be required on Radius servers
      in order to achieve this.

   o  For off-line traceability, syslog might be a good choice.
      [RFC6269] indicates address sharing solutions generally need to
      record and store information for specific periods of time.  A
      stateful NAT64 is supposed to manage one mapping per session.  A
      large volume of logs poses a challenge for storage and processing.
      In order to mitigate the issue,
      [I-D.donley-behave-deterministic-cgn]is proposed to pre-allocated
      a group of ports for each specific IPv6 host.  A trade-off among
      address multiplexing efficiency, port randomization
      security[RFC6056] and logging storage compression should be
      considered during the planning.  A hybrid mode combining
      deterministic and dynamic port assignment was recommended
      regarding the uncertainty of user traffic.

3.4.  Quality of Experience

   NAT64 is providing a translation capability between IPv6 and IPv4
   end-nodes.  In order to provide the reachability between two IP
   address families, NAT64-CGN has to implement appropriate ALGs where
   address translation is not itself sufficient and security mechanisms
   do not render it infeasible. e.g.  FTP-ALG[RFC6384], RSTP-ALG, H.323-
   ALG,etc.  It should be noted that ALGs may impact the performance on
   a NAT64 box to some extent.  ISPs as well as content providers might
   choose to avoid situations where the imposition of an ALG might be
   required.  At the same time, it is also important to remind customers
   and application developers that IPv6 end-to-end usage does not
   require ALG imposition and therefore results in a better overall user
   experience.

   Session status normally is managed by a static life-cycle.  In some
   cases, NAT resource maybe significantly consumed by largely inactive
   users.  The NAT translator and other customers would suffer from
   service degradation due to port consummation by other subscribers
   using the same NAT64 device.  A flexible NAT session control is
   desirable to resolve the issues.  PCP[I-D.ietf-pcp-base] could be a
   candidate to provide such capability.  A NAT64-CGN should integrate
   with a PCP server, to allocate available IPv4 address/Port resources.
   Resources could be assigned to PCP clients through PCP MAP/PEER mode.
   Such an ability should also be considered to upgrade user
   experiences, e.g. assigning different sizes of port ranges for
   different subscribers.  Such a mechanism is also helpful to minimize
   terminal battery consumption and reduce the number of keepalive
   messages to be sent by terminal devices.

3.5.  NAT64-CGN Load Balancer

   Load balancers are an essential tool to avoid the issue of single
   points of failure and add additional scale.  It is potentially
   important to employ load-balancing considering that deployment of
   multiple NAT64 devices.  Load balancers are required to achieve some
   service continuity and scale for customers.
   [I-D.zhang-behave-nat64-load-balancing] discusses several ways of
   achieving NAT64 load balancing, including anycast based policy and
   prefix64 selection based policy, either implemented via
   DNS64[RFC6147] or Prefix64 assignments.  Since DNS64 is normally co-
   located with NAT64 in some scenarios, it could be leveraged to
   perform the load balance.  For traffic which does not require a DNS
   resolution, prefix64 assignment based
   on[I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-learn-analysis] could be adopted.

3.6.  MTU Consideration

   IPv6 requires that every link in the internet have an MTU of 1280
   octets or greater[RFC2460].  However, in case of NAT64 translation
   deployment, some IPv4 MTU constrained link will be used in some
   communication path and originating IPv6 nodes may therefore receive
   an ICMP Packet Too Big message, reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than
   1280.  The result would be that IPv6 allows packets to contain a
   fragmentation header, without the packet being fragmented into
   multiple pieces.  [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-atomic-fragments] discusses how
   this situation could be exploited by an attacker to perform
   fragmentation-based attacks, and also proposes an improved handling
   of such packets.  It required enhancements on protocol level, which
   might imply potential upgrade/modifications on behaviors to deployed
   nodes.  Another approach that potentially avoids this issue is to
   configure IPv4 MTU>=1260.  It would forbid the occurrence of
   PTB<1280.  However, such an operational consideration is hard to

4.1.  NAT64-FE Networking

   There are plenty of practices to equip load balancer with NAT64 at
   front of servers.  Two different cases appeared in the NAT64-FE
   networking.

   o  Some content providers who has a wealth of IPv6 experiences
      consider IPv6-only strategy to serve customers since it allows new
      services delivery without having to integrate consideration of
      IPv4 NAT and address limitations of IPv4 networks.  Whereas they
      have to provide some IPv4 service continuity to their customers,
      stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT) [RFC6145]has been used to
      continue provide services for IPv4 subscribers.

   o  ICPs who have insufficient IPv6 incentive likely prefer short-term
      alternatives to provide IPv6 connectivity due to the widespread
      impact of supporting IPv6 within a ICP environment.  A stateful
      NAT64 has been located at front of servers.  It could
      simultaneously facilitate the IPv6 accessibility and conservation
      of IPv4 servers.  [I-D.ietf-v6ops-icp-guidance]has described the
      cases, in which an HTTP proxy can readily be configured to handle
      incoming connections over IPv6 and to proxy them to a server over
      IPv4.

   For first case, [I-D.anderson-siit-dc]has provided further
   descriptions and guidelines.  This document is addressed to second

   case.  An administrator of the IPv4 network needs to be cautious and
   aware of the operational issues in the case since the native IPv6 is
   always more desirable than transition solutions.

   One potential challenge is stateful NAT64-FE facing IPv6 Internet, in
   which a significant number of IPv6 users may initiate connections.
   When increasingly numerous users in IPv6 Internet access an IPv4
   network, scalability concerns(e.g. additional latency, a single point
   of failure, IPv4 pool exhaustion, etc) are apt to be applied.  For a
   given off-the-shelf NAT64-FE, those challenges should be seriously
   assessed.  Potential issues should be properly identified.

   Following subsections described several considerations to stateful
   NAT64-FE case.  For operators who seek a clear precedent for
   operating reliable IPv6-only services, it should be well noted that
   the usage is problematic.

4.2.  Source Address Traceability

   IP addresses are usually used as input to geo-location services.  The
   use of address sharing will prevent these systems from resolving the
   location of a host based on IP address alone.  Applications that
   assume such geographic information may not work as intended.  The
   possible solutions listed at section 3.3 intended to bridge the gap.
   However, the analysis reveals those solutions can't be a optimal
   substitution to solve the problem of host identification, in
   particular it does not today mitigate problems with source
   identification through translation.  That makes NAT64-FE usage
   becoming a unappealing approach, if customers require source address
   tracking.

   For the operators, who already deployed NAT64-FE approach, the source
   address of the request is obscured without the source address mapping
   information previously obtained.  It's superior to present mapping
   information directly to applications.  Some application layer proxies
   e.g.  XFF (X-Forwarded-For) , can convey this information in-band.
   Another approach is to ask application coordinating the information
   with NAT logging.  But that is not sufficient, since the applications
   itself wants to know the original source address from an application
   message bus.  The logging information may be used by administrators
   offline to inspect use behavior and preference analysis, and accurate
   advertisement delivery.

4.3.  DNS Resolving

   In the case of NAT64-FE, it is recommended to follow the
   recommendations in [RFC6144].  There is no need for the DNS to
   synthesize AAAA from A records, since static AAAA records can be

   registered in the authoritative DNS for a given domain to represent
   these IPv4-only hosts.  How to design the FQDN for the IPv6 service
   is out-of-scope of this document.

4.4.  Load Balancer

   Load balancing on NAT64-FE has a couple of considerations.  If
   dictated by scale or availability requirements traffic should be
   balanced among multiple NAT64-CE devices.  One point to be noted is
   that synthetic AAAA records may be added directly in authoritative
   DNS. load balancing based on DNS64 synthetic resource records may not
   work in those cases.  Secondly, NAT64-FE could also serve as the load
   balancer for IPv4 backend servers.  There are also some ways of load
   balance for the cases, where load balancer is placed in front of
   NAT64-FE.

4.5.  MTU Consideration

   As compared to the MTU consideration in NAT64-CGN, the MTU of IPv4
   network are strongly recommended to set to more than 1260.  Since a
   IPv4 network is normally operated by a particular administrative
   entity, it should take steps to prevent the risk of fragmentation
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-atomic-fragments].

4.6.  Anti-DDoS/SYN Flood

   For every incoming new connection from the IPv6 Internet, the
   stateful NAT64-FE creates state and maps that connection to an
   internally-facing IPv4 address and port.  An attacker can consume the
   resources of the NAT64-FE device by sending an excessive number of
   connection attempts.  Without a DDOS limitation mechanism, the
   NAT64-FE is exposed to attacks.  With service provisioning, attacks
   have the potential could also deteriorate service quality.  One
   consideration in internet content providers is place a L3 load
   balancer with capable of line rate DDOS defense, such as the
   employment of SYN PROXY-COOKIE.  Security domain division is
   necessary in this case.  Load Balancers could not only serve for
   optimization of traffic distribution, but also serve as a DOS
   mitigation device.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document presents the deployment experiences of NAT64 in CGN and
   FE scenario, some security considerations are described in detail
   regarding to specific NAT64 mode in section 3 and 4.  In general, RFC
   6146[RFC6146] provides TCP-tracking, address-dependent filtering
   mechanisms to protect NAT64 from DDOS.  In NAT64-CGN cases, ISP also

   could adopt uRPF and black/white-list to enhance the security by
   specifying access policies.  For example, NAT64-CGN should forbid
   establish NAT64 BIB for incoming IPv6 packets if URPF (Strict or
   Loose mode) check does not pass or whose source IPv6 address is
   associated to black-lists.
