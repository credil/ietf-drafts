This memo documents a process intended to apply architectural
discipline to the future development of the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP).  There have been concerns with regards to new SIP
proposals.  Specifically, that the addition of new SIP features can be
damaging towards security and/or greatly increase the complexity of
the protocol.  The Transport Area directors, along with the SIP and
Session Initiation Proposal Investigation (SIPPING) working group
chairs, have provided suggestions for SIP modifications and
extensions.
