Internet-Draft                 ABNF Import                  January 2013


1.  Introduction

   The intent of this proposal is to better support current practice
   where one draft or RFC extends the ABNF from another draft or RFC, or
   references ABNF rules defined elsewhere when defining something new.

   Currently that is done using comments that identify the source of the
   referenced definitions.  Formally processing this requires manual
   actions to cut and paste definitions from multiple documents to
   create a single ABNF source that can be processed for formal tools.

   With the proposed changes, it will be possible to build ABNF tools
   that automatically extract the required definitions.

   The changes that support this are:
   o  A way to assign a name to a rule list within a document

      This allows multiple independent groups of rules to be defined
      within a single document and referenced independently.  For
      flexibility, nesting of named rule lists is permitted.
   o  A way to reference a rule defined in a named collection of rules
   o  A way to import rule definitions from another document

      The reference identifies the document and may name a specific
      named rule list within that document.  When importing a named rule
      list, it may be imported with or without the name.  The
      definitions are copied into


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Extensions to ABNF Syntax

   The following are additions to the ABNF for ABNF defined in
   [RFC5234].

       rulelist =/ 1*(
          named-rulelist / rulelist-import / rule/ (*c-wsp c-nl) )
        ; this is really a backward compatible replacement definition

       named-rulelist =
          rulelist-name *WSP "{" rulelist "}" c-nl

       rulelist-name = rulename

       rulelist-import =
          (basic-import / named-import) c-nl

       basic-import = "@" docname
        ; imports all the ABNF from the named document

       docname = char-val
        ; format and resolution of the document from the docname
        ; is defined by the specific tools used.
        ; At least common URI types should be supported
        ; E.g. "urn:ietf:rfc:5234",
        ;      "urn:ietf:id:draft-ietf-foo-bar-01",
        ;      "file:foo.xml"

       named-import = rulelist-name basic-import
        ; (E.g. CORE@"urn:ietf:rfc:5234")
        ; This is shorthand for importing into a new named
        ; rulelist with the given name.

       element =/ scoped-rulename

       scoped-rulename = 1*(rulelist-name ".") rulename



4.  Import Semantics

   Importing logically replaces the import statement with text from the
   imported document.  Importing may be done in two ways:
   o  The <basic-import> simply inserts all the ABNF from the referenced
      document.
   o  The <named-import> is similar, but does the import within a new
      <named-rulelist>.  This is just syntactic sugar, but is
      convenient.  E.g. the following:


       CORE@"urn:ietf:rfc:5234"

Internet-Draft                 ABNF Import                  January 2013


      is equivalent to:


       CORE {
          @"urn:ietf:rfc:5234"
       }


   Note that if the imported rules contain references to rules that are
   not imported, then the importing document must provide definitions
   for those.

   For now, the ABNF syntax of ABNF defines a docname as a string
   without further syntax.  Interpretation of the docname is deferred to
   the ABNF processing tools.  I propose that this should at least
   support common URI formats, including the urn:ietf format for rfcs
   and ids.  It may also be expedient to support some more concise
   syntax for ietf documents.

   The intent is that the import statements only import the ABNF
   definitions from the referenced document, ignoring any content that
   is not ABNF.  This is so that ABNF from RFCs and drafts can be
   referenced directly.  The xml2rfc notation <artwork type='abnf'>
   should be sufficient to support this.  If multiple abnf artwork
   elements are present they should simply be concatenated to form one
   logical document to be imported.


5.  Scoping of Names

   A document containing ABNF has an implicit outermost scope.  Each
   scope has a symbol table for rules and named rulelists defined within
   that scope.

   The appearance of a <named-rulelist> with a particular <rulelist-
   name> creates a nested scope with that name within the enclosing
   scope's symbol table.  Once a named rulelist has been closed it may
   not be reopened.  (This ensures that redefinition of a named rulelist
   is an error, preventing a class of errors.)

   An element consisting of a <rulename> is resolved within the symbol
   table of the scope where it is found.  If not found, resolution is
   attempted successively in each enclosing scope.

   An element consisting of a <scoped-rulename> is resolved as follows:
   o  The leftmost component of the <scoped-rulename> (the first
      <rulelist-name>) is resolved first.

   o  It is resolved by looking within the symbol table of the scope
      where it is found.  If not found, resolution is attempted
      successively in each enclosing scope, and must resolve to a
      <named-rulelist>.
   o  Then the next component (<rulelist-name> or <rulename>) is
      resolved within the symbol table of that rulelist.  This continues
      until the last component has been resolved.

   I'm undecided whether it should be possible to have both a rule and a
   rulelist with the same name in the same scope.

   It is important to maintain the order independence of rule
   definitions that exists with prior definitions of ABNF.  (It must be
   possible to reference a rule in a named rulelist that is defined
   later.)


6.  IANA Considerations

   Don't think so.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security is truly believed to be irrelevant to this document.
