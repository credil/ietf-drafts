        This document registers the application/sdpfrag Multipurpose
        Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) media type.  This type is
        similar to application/sdp, but allows certain subsets of well
        formed session descriptions, as per the Session Description
        Protocol (SDP), to be represented instead of requiring a
        complete SDP session description. The "a=candidate" lines
        that are incrementally exchanged between Trickle ICE agents are
        one example usage of the application/sdpfrag.

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        The application/sdp MIME media type defined in <xref
        target="RFC4566"/> carries an entire well formed SDP session
        description. Yet, creating such a description may sometimes
        require a relatively long time as, for example, would be the
        case when the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> protocol is in use and candidates need
        to be acquire in different, often time consuming methods. Some
        applications may therefore choose to use mechanisms like Trickle
        ICE <xref target="I-D.ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice"/> that would allow
        them to send initial session descriptions with only readily
        available information and then exchange candidates only when
        they become available.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document does NOT provide a mechanism to segment an SDP
        session description into multiple pieces for separate transport
        and later reassemble.

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

    <section title=' Definition: application/sdpfrag'
             anchor='definition'>
      <t>
        A valid application/sdpfrag part is one that could be obtained
        by starting with some valid SDP session description and deleting
        any number of lines.

        [TODO maybe mention that we can only do frags with the
        declarative parts of an SDP offer/answer and not with the ones
        used in negotiations.]
