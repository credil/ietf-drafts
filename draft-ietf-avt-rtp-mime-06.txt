This document defines the procedure to register RTP Payload Formats
as audio, video or other MIME subtype names.  This is useful in a
text-based format or control protocol to identify the type of an
RTP transmission.  This document also registers all the RTP payload
formats defined in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences
as MIME subtypes.  Some of these may also be used for transfer
modes other than RTP.

This document is a product of the Audio/Video Transport Working Group
of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
