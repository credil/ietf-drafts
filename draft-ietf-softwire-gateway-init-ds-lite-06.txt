              Gateway Initiated Dual-Stack Lite Deployment
              draft-ietf-softwire-gateway-init-ds-lite-06

Abstract

   Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack lite (GI-DS-lite) is a variant of Dual-
   Stack lite (DS-lite) applicable to certain tunnel-based access
   architectures.  GI-DS-lite extends existing access tunnels beyond the
   access gateway to an IPv4-IPv4 NAT using softwires with an embedded
   context identifier that uniquely identifies the end-system the
   tunneled packets belong to.  The access gateway determines which
   portion of the traffic requires NAT using local policies and sends/
   receives this portion to/from this softwire.

Internet-Draft          Gateway-Initiated DS-Lite          December 2011


1.  Overview

   Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack lite (GI-DS-lite) is a variant of the
   Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) [RFC6333], applicable to network
   architectures which use point to point tunnels between the access
   device and the access gateway.  The access gateway in these models is
   designed to serve large numbers of access devices.  Mobile
   architectures based on Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275], Proxy Mobile IPv6
   [RFC5213], or GTP [TS29060], as well as broadband architectures based
   on PPP or point-to-point VLANs as defined by the Broadband Forum (see
   [TR59] and [TR101]) are examples for this type of architecture.

   The DS-lite approach leverages IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels (or other
   tunneling modes) for carrying the IPv4 traffic from the customer
   network to the Address Family Transition Router (AFTR).  An
   established softwire between the AFTR and the access device is used
   for traffic forwarding purposes.  This turns the inner IPv4 address
   irrelevant for traffic routing and allows sharing private IPv4
   addresses [RFC1918] between customer sites within the service
   provider network.

   Similar to DS-lite, GI-DS-lite enables the service provider to share
   public IPv4 addresses among different customers by combining
   tunneling and NAT.  It allows multiple access devices behind the
   access gateway to share the same private IPv4 address [RFC1918].
   Rather than initiating the tunnel right on the access device, GI-DS-
   lite logically extends the already existing access tunnels beyond the
   access gateway towards the Address Family Transition Router (AFTR)
   using a tunneling mechanism with semantics for carrying context state
   related to the encapsulated traffic.  This approach results in
   supporting overlapping IPv4 addresses in the access network,
   requiring no changes to either the access device, or to the access
   architecture.  Additional tunneling overhead in the access network is
   also omitted.  If e.g., a GRE based encapsulation mechanisms is
   chosen, it allows the network between the access gateway and the AFTR
   to be either IPv4 or IPv6 and provides the operator to migrate to
   IPv6 in incremental steps.

3.  Gateway Initiated DS-Lite

   The section provides an overview of Gateway Initiated DS-Lite (GI-DS-
   lite).  Figure 1 outlines the generic deployment scenario for GI-DS-
   lite.  This generic scenario can be mapped to multiple different
   access architectures, some of which are described in Appendix A.

   In Figure 1, access devices (AD-1 and AD-2) are connected to the
   Gateway using some form of tunnel technology and the same is used for
   carrying IPv4 (and optionally IPv6) traffic of the access device.
   These access devices may also be connected to the Gateway over point-
   to-point links.  The details on how the network delivers the IPv4
   address configuration to the access devices are specific to the
   access architecture and are outside the scope of this document.  With
   GI-DS-lite, Gateway and AFTR are connected by a softwire [RFC4925].
   The softwire is identified by a softwire identifier (SWID).  The SWID
   does not need to be globally unique, i.e. different SWIDs could be
   used to identify a softwire at the different ends of a softwire.  The
   form of the SWID depends on the tunneling technology used for the
   softwire.  The SWID could e.g. be the endpoints of a GRE-tunnel or a
   VPN-ID, see Section 6 for details.  A Context-Identifier (CID) is
   used to multiplex flows associated with the individual access devices
   onto the softwire.  Deployment dependent, the flows from a particular
   AD can be identified using either the source IP-address or an access
   tunnel identifier.  Local policies at the Gateway determine which
   part of the traffic received from an access device is tunneled over
   the softwire to the AFTR.  The combination of CID and SWID must be
   unique between gateway and AFTR to identify the flows associated with
   an AD.  The CID is typically a 32-bit wide identifier and is assigned

   by the Gateway.  It is retrieved either from a local or remote (e.g.
   AAA) repository.  Like the SWID, the embodiment of the CID depends on
   the tunnel mode used and the type of the network connecting Gateway
   and AFTR.  If, for example GRE [RFC2784] with "GRE Key and Sequence
   Number Extensions" [RFC2890] is used as softwire technology, the
   network connecting Gateway and AFTR could be either IPv4-only, IPv6-
   only, or a dual-stack IP network.  The CID would be carried within
   the GRE-key field.  See Section 6 for details on different softwire
   types supported with GI-DS-lite.

                        Context Id: CID-1

   The AFTR combines softwire termination and IPv4-IPv4 NAT.  The NAT
   binding of the AD's address could be assigned autonomously by the
   AFTR from a local address pool, configured on a per-binding basis
   (either by a remote control entity through a NAT control protocol or
   through manual configuration), or derived from the CID (e.g., the
   CID, in case 32-bit wide, could be mapped 1:1 to an external IPv4-
   address).  A simple example of a translation table at the AFTR is
   shown in Figure 2.  The choice of the appropriate translation scheme
   for a traffic flow can take parameters such as destination IP-
   address, incoming interface, etc. into account.  The IP-address of
   the AFTR, which, depending on the transport network between the
   Gateway and the AFTR, will either be an IPv6 or an IPv4 address, is
   configured on the Gateway.  A variety of methods, such as out-of-band
   mechanisms, or manual configuration apply.

   GI-DS-lite does not require a 1:1 relationship between Gateway and
   AFTR, but more generally applies to (M:N) scenarios, where M Gateways
   are connected to N AFTRs.  Multiple Gateways could be served by a
   single AFTR.  AFTRs could be dedicated to specifc groups of access-
   devices, groups of Gateways, or geographic regions.  An AFTR could,
   but does not have to be co-located with a Gateway.


4.  Protocol and related Considerations

   o  Depending on the embodiment of the CID (e.g. for GRE-encapsulation
      with GRE-key), the NAT binding entry maintained at the AFTR, which
      reflects an active flow between an access device inside the
      network and a node in the Internet, needs to be extended to
      include the CID and the identifier of the softwire (SWID).

   o  When creating an IPv4 to IPv4 NAT binding for an IPv4 packet flow
      received from the Gateway over the softwire, the AFTR will
      associate the CID with that NAT binding.  It will use the
      combination of CID and SWID as the unique identifier and will
      store it in the NAT binding entry.

   o  When forwarding a packet to the access device, the AFTR will
      obtain the CID from the NAT binding associated with that flow.
      E.g., in case of GRE-encapsulation, it will add the CID to the GRE
      Key and Sequence number extension of the GRE header and tunnel it
      to the Gateway.

   o  On receiving any packet from the softwire, the AFTR will obtain
      the CID from the incoming packet and will use it for performing
      the NAT binding look up and for performing the packet translation
      before forwarding the packet.

   o  The Gateway, on receiving any IPv4 packet from the access device
      will lookup the CID for that access device.  In case of GRE
      encapsulation it will for example add the CID to the GRE Key and
      Sequence number extension of the GRE header and tunnel it to the

      AFTR.

   o  On receiving any packet from the softwire, the Gateway will obtain
      the CID from the packet and will use it for making the forwarding
      decision.  There will be an association between the CID and the
      forwarding state.

   o  When encapsulating an IPv4 packet, Gateway and AFTR can use its
      Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP) to derive the DSCP (or MPLS Traffic-
      Class Field in case of MPLS) of the softwire.


5.  Softwire Management and related Considerations

   The following are the considerations related to the operational
   management of the softwire between AFTR and Gateway.

   o  The softwire between the Gateway and the AFTR MAY be created at
      system startup time OR dynamically established on-demand.
      Deployment dependent, Gateway and AFTR can employ OAM mechanisms
      such as ICMP, BFD [RFC5880], or LSP ping [RFC4379] for softwire
      health management and corresponding protection strategies.

   o  The softwire peers may be provisioned to perform policy
      enforcement, such as for determining the protocol-type or overall
      portion of traffic that gets tunneled, or for any other quality of
      service related settings.  The specific details on how this is
      achieved or the types of policies that can be applied are outside
      the scope for this document.

   o  The softwire peers must have a proper understanding of the path
      MTU value.  This can be statically configured at softwire creation
      time.

   o  A Gateway and an AFTR can have multiple softwires established
      between them (e.g. to separate address domains, provide for load-
      sharing etc.).


6.  Softwire Embodiments

   Deployment and requirements dependent, different tunnel technologies
   apply for the softwire connecting Gateway and AFTR.  GRE
   encapsulation with GRE-key extensions, MPLS VPNs [RFC4364], or plain
   IP-in-IP encapsulation can be used.  Softwire identification and
   Context-ID depend on the tunneling technology employed:





Brockners, et al.         Expires June 18, 2012                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Gateway-Initiated DS-Lite          December 2011


   o  SWID is the source address of the GRE tunnel from the GW.  The CID
      is the GRE-key associated with the AD.

   o  MPLS VPN: The SWID is a generic identifier which uniquely
      identifies the VPN at either the Gateway or AFTR.  Depending on
      whether the Gateway or AFTR are acting as CE or PE, the SWID could
      e.g. be an attachment circuit identifier, an identifier
      representing the set of VPN route labels pointing to the routes
      within the VPN, etc.  The AD's IPv4-address is the CID.  For a
      given VPN, the AD's IPv4 address must be unique.

   o  IPv4/IPv6-in-MPLS: The SWID is the top MPLS label.  CID might be
      the next MPLS label in the stack, if present, or the IP address of
      the AD.

   o  IPv4-in-IPv4: SWID is the outer IPv4 source address.  The AD's
      IPv4 address is the CID.  For a given outer IPv4 source address,
      the AD's IPv4 address must be unique.

   o  IPv4-in-IPv6: SWID is the outer IPv6 source address.  If the AD's
      IPv4 address is used as CID, the AD's IPv4 address must be unique.
      If the IPv6-Flow-Label [RFC6437] is used as CID, the IPv4
      addresses of the ADs may overlap.  Given that the IPv6-Flow-Label
      is 20-bit wide, which is shorter than the recommended 32-bit CID,
      large scale deployments may require additional scaling
      considerations.  In addition, one should ensure sufficient
      randomization of the IP-Flow-Label to avoid possible interference
      with other uses of the IP-Flow-Label, such as ECMP.

   apply to different deployment scenarios. "x" indicates that a certain
   deployment scenario is supported.  The following abbreviations are

      *  "s": Deployments where all access devices are assigned the same
         IPv4 address are supported.

A.1.  Connectivity establishment: Example call flow

   Figure 4 shows an example call flow - linking access tunnel
   establishment on the Gateway with the softwire to the AFTR.  This
   simple example assumes that traffic from the AD uses a single access
   tunnel and that the Gateway will use local polices to decide which
   portion of the traffic received over this access tunnel needs to be
   forwarded to the AFTR.

           Figure 4: Example call flow for session establishment

   1.  Gateway receives a request to create an access tunnel endpoint.

   2.  The Gateway authenticates and authorizes the access tunnel.
       Based on local policy or through interaction with the AAA/Policy
       system the Gateway recognizes that IPv4 service should be
       provided using GI-DS-lite.

   3.  The Gateway creates an access tunnel endpoint.  The access tunnel
       links AD and Gateway.

   4.  (Optional): The Gateway and the AFTR establish a control session
       between each other.  This session can for example be used to
       exchange accounting or NAT-configuration information.  Accounting
       information could be supplied to the Gateway, AAA/Policy, or
       other network entities which require information about the
       externally visible address/port pairs of a particular access
       device.  The Diameter NAT Control Application (see
       [I-D.draft-ietf-dime-nat-control] could for example be used for
       this purpose.

   5.  The Gateway allocates a unique CID and associates those flows
       received from the access tunnel that need to be tunneled towards
       the AFTR with the softwire linking Gateway and AFTR.  Local
       forwarding policy on the Gateway determines which traffic will
       need to be tunneled towards the AFTR.

   6.  Gateway and AD complete the access tunnel establishment
       (depending on the procedures and mechanisms of the corresponding
       access network architecture this step can include the assignment
       of an IPv4 address to the AD).

A.2.  GI-DS-lite applicability: Examples

   The section outlines deployment examples of the generic GI-DS-lite
   architecture described in Section 3.

   o  Mobile IP based access architectures: In a MIPv6 [RFC5555] based
      network scenario, the Mobile IPv6 home agent will implement the
      GI-DS-lite Gateway function along with the dual-stack Mobile IPv6
      functionality.

   o  Proxy Mobile IP based access architectures: In a PMIPv6 [RFC5213]
      scenario the local mobility anchor (LMA) will implement the GI-DS-
      lite Gateway function along with the PMIPv6 IPv4 support
      functionality.

   o  GTP based access architectures: 3GPP TS 23.401 [TS23401] and 3GPP
      TS 23.060 [TS23060] define mobile access architectures using GTP.
      For GI-DS-lite, the PDN-Gateway/GGSN will also assume the Gateway
      function.

   o  Fixed WiMAX architecture: If GI-DS-lite is applied to fixed WiMAX,
      the ASN-Gateway will implement the GI-DS-lite Gateway function.

   o  Mobile WiMAX: If GI-DS-lite is applied to mobile WiMAX, the home
      agent will implement the Gateway function.

   o  PPP-based broadband access architectures: If GI-DS-lite is applied
      to PPP-based access architectures the Broadband Remote Access
      Server (BRAS) or Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) will implement
      the GI-DS-lite Gateway function.

   o  In broadband access architectures using per-subscriber VLANs the
      BNG will implement the GI-DS-lite Gateway function.
