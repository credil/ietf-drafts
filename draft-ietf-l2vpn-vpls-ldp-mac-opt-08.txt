     LDP Extensions for Optimized MAC Address Withdrawal in H-VPLS
                  draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt-08

Abstract

   [RFC4762] describes a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses
   that have been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster
   convergence on topology change.  The procedure also removes MAC
   addresses in the VPLS that do not require relearning due to such
   topology change.  This document defines an enhancement to the MAC
   Address Withdrawal procedure with empty MAC List [RFC4762], which
   enables a Provider Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses
   that need to be relearned.  Additional extensions to [RFC4762] MAC
   Withdrawal procedures are specified to provide optimized MAC flushing
   for the PBB-VPLS specified in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model] .

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model], [RFC5036], [RFC4447] and
   [RFC4762].

   Throughout this document VPLS means the emulated bridged LAN service
   offered to a customer.  H-VPLS means the hierarchical connectivity or
   layout of MTU-s and PE-rs devices offering the VPLS [RFC4762].

   The terms "Spoke Node" and "MTU-s" in H-VPLS are used
   interchangeably.

   "Spoke PW" means the PW (Pseudowire) that provides connectivity
   between MTU-s and PE-rs nodes.

   "Mesh PW" means the PW that provides connectivity between PE-rs nodes
   in a VPLS full mesh core.

   "MAC Flush Message" means LDP Address Withdraw Message without MAC
   List TLV.

   MAC Flush Message in the "context of a PW" means the Message that has
   been received over the LDP session that is used to set up the PW used
   to provide connectivity in VPLS.  The MAC Flush Message carries the
   context of the PW in terms of FEC TLV associated with the PW
   [RFC4762][RFC4447].

   In general, "MAC Flush" means the method of initiating and processing
   of MAC Flush Messages across a VPLS instance.


2.  Introduction

   A method of Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also known as
   Transparent LAN Service (TLS) is described in [RFC4762].  A VPLS is
   created using a collection of one or more point-to-point pseudowires
   (PWs) [RFC4664] configured in a flat, full-mesh topology.  The mesh
   topology provides a LAN segment or broadcast domain that is fully
   capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses at the
   PE devices.

   This VPLS full mesh core configuration can be augmented with
   additional non-meshed spoke nodes to provide a Hierarchical VPLS
   (H-VPLS) service [RFC4762].  Throughout this document this
   configuration is referred to as "regular" H-VPLS.

   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model] describes how Provider Backbone

   Bridging (PBB) can be integrated with VPLS to allow for useful PBB
   capabilities while continuing to avoid the use of MSTP in the
   backbone.  The combined solution referred to as PBB-VPLS results in
   better scalability in terms of number of service instances, PWs and
   C-MAC (Customer MAC) Addresses that need to be handled in the VPLS
   PEs depending on the location of the I-component in the PBB-VPLS
   topology.

   A MAC Address Withdrawal mechanism for VPLS is described in [RFC4762]
   to remove or unlearn MAC addresses for faster convergence on topology
   change in resilient H-VPLS topologies.  Note that the H-VPLS topology
   in [RFC4762] describes two tier hierarchy to VPLS as the basic
   building block of H-VPLS, but it is possible to have multi-tier
   hierarchy in an H-VPLS.

   The figure 1. described below is taken from [RFC4762] that describes
   dual-homing in H-VPLS.

   redundancy is designed to protect against the failure of primary
   spoke PW or primary PE device.  There could be multiple methods of
   dual homing in H-VPLS that are not described in [RFC4762].  For
   example, note the following statement from section 10.2.1 in
   [RFC4762].

   "How a spoke is designated primary or secondary is outside the scope
   of this document.  For example, a spanning tree instance running
   between only the MTU-s and the two PE-rs nodes is one possible
   method.  Another method could be configuration".

   This document intends to clarify several H-VPLS dual-homing models
   that are deployed in practice and various use cases of LDP based MAC
   flush in these models.

   When the MTU-s switches over to the backup PW, the requirement is to
   flush the MAC addresses learned in the corresponding VSI in peer PE
   devices participating in the full mesh, to avoid black holing of
   frames to those addresses.  This is accomplished by sending an LDP
   Address Withdraw Message from the PE that is no longer connected to
   the MTU-s with the primary PW, with the list of MAC addresses to be
   removed to all other PEs over the corresponding LDP sessions
   [RFC4762].

   In order to minimize the impact on LDP convergence time and
   scalability when a MAC List TLV contains a large number of MAC
   addresses, many implementations use a LDP Address Withdraw Message
   with an empty MAC List.  Throughout this document the term "MAC Flush
   Message" is used to specify LDP Address Withdraw Message with an
   empty MAC List described in [RFC4762] unless specified otherwise.
   The solutions described in this document are applicable only to LDP
   Address Withdraw Message with empty MAC List.

   In a VPLS topology, the core PWs remain active and learning happens
   on the PE-rs nodes.  However when the VPLS topology changes, the
   PE-rs must relearn using MAC Addresses withdrawal or flush.  As per
   the MAC Address Withdrawal processing rules in [RFC4762] a PE device
   on receiving a MAC Flush Message removes all MAC addresses associated
   with the specified VPLS instance (as indicated in the FEC TLV) except
   the MAC addresses learned over the PW associated with this signaling
   session over which the message was received.  Throughout this
   document we use the terminology "Positive" MAC Flush or "Flush-all-
   but-mine" for this type of MAC Flush Message and its actions.

2.1.  MAC Flush on activation of backup spoke PW

   This section describes scenarios where MAC Flush withdrawal is
   initiated on activation of backup PW in H-VPLS.

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


2.1.1.  PE-rs initiated MAC Flush

   [RFC4762] specifies that on failure of the primary PW, it is the
   PE3-rs (Figure 1) that initiates MAC flush towards the core.  However
   note that PE3-rs can initiate MAC Flush only when PE3-rs is dual
   homing "aware" - that is, there is some redundancy management
   protocol running between MTU-s and its host PE-rs devices.  The scope
   of this document is not specific to any dual homing protocols.  One
   example could be BGP based multi-homing in LDP based VPLS that uses
   the procedures defined in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-multihoming].  In this
   method of dual-homing, PE3-rs would neither forward any traffic to
   MTU-s neither would receive any traffic from MTU-s while PE1-rs is
   acting a primary (or designated forwarder).

2.1.2.  MTU-s initiatied MAC flush

   When dual homing is achieved by manual configuration in MTU-s, the
   hosting PE-rs devices are dual homing "agnostic" and PE3-rs can not
   initiate MAC Flush message.  PE3-rs can send or receive traffic over
   the backup PW since the dual-homing control is with MTU-s only.  When
   the backup PW is made active by the MTU-s, the MTU-s triggers MAC
   Flush Message.  The message is sent over the LDP session associated
   with the newly activated PW.  On receiving the MAC Flush Message from
   MTU-s, PE3-rs (PE-rs device with now-active PW) would flush all the
   MAC addresses it has learned except the ones learned over the newly
   activated spoke PW.  PE3-rs further initiates a MAC Flush Message to
   all other PE devices in the core.  Note that forced switchover to
   backup PW can be also performed at MTU-s administratively due to
   maintenance activities on the "erstwhile" primary spoke PW.

   MTU-s initiated method of MAC flushing is modeled after Topology
   Change Notification (TCN) in Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)
   [IEEE.802.1Q-2011].  When a bridge switches from a failed link to the
   backup link, the bridge sends out a TCN message over the newly
   activated link.  The upstream bridge upon receiving this message
   flushes its entire MAC addresses except the ones received over this
   link and sends the TCN message out of its other ports in that
   spanning tree instance.  The message is further relayed along the
   spanning tree by the other bridges.

   The MAC Flush information is propagated in the control plane.  The
   control plane message propagation is associated with the data path
   and hence follows similar rules for propagation as the forwarding in
   the LDP data plane.  For example PE-rs nodes follow the data plane
   "split-horizon" forwarding rules in H-VPLS (Refer to section 4.4 in
   [RFC4762]).  Therefore a MAC Flush is propagated in the context of
   mesh PW(s) when it is received in the context of a spoke PW.  When a
   PE-rs node receives a MAC Flush in the context of a mesh PW then it



Dutta, et al.            Expires August 29, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


   is not propagated to other mesh PWs.

   Irrespective of whether a MAC Flush is initiated by a PE-rs or MTU-s,
   when a PE-rs device in the full-mesh of H-VPLS receives a MAC flush
   message it also flushes MAC addresses which are not affected due to
   topology change, thus leading to unnecessary flooding and relearning.
   This document describes an optional mechanism to optimize the MAC
   flush procedure in [RFC4762] so that it flushes only the set of MAC
   addresses that require relearning when topology changes in H-VPLS.

2.2.  MAC Flush on failure

   MAC Flush on failure is introduced in this document.  In this model,
   the MAC Flush is initiated by PE1-rs (Figure 1) on detection of
   failure of the primary spoke PW and is sent to all participating
   PE-rs devices in the VPLS full-mesh.  PE1-rs SHOULD initiate MAC
   flush only if PE1-rs is dual homing aware.  (If PE1-rs is dual homing
   agnostic, the policy is do not initiate a MAC flush on failure, since
   that could cause unnecessary flushing in the case of single homed
   MTU-s.)  The dual-homing protocols for this scenario are outside the
   scope of this document.  For example, the case of PE1-rs initiated
   MAC flush on failure may arise when the dual-homing segment is native
   ethernet as opposed to spoke PWs.  In this case the PE-rs devices
   that receives the MAC flush from PE1-rs are required to flush all the
   MAC addresses learned over the PW connected to PE1-rs.  This cannot
   be achieved with the MAC Address Withdraw Message defined in
   [RFC4762].  This document describes extensions to MAC Flush
   procedures defined in [RFC4762] in order to implement MAC Flush on
   Failure.  We use the term "negative" MAC flush or "Flush-all-from-me"
   for this kind of flushing action as opposed to "positive" MAC Flush
   action in [RFC4762].  The negative MAC flush typically results is a
   smaller set of MACs to be flushed.

   Note that in the case of negative flush the list SHOULD be only the
   MACs for the affected MTU-s.  If the list is empty then the negative
   flush will result in flushing and relearning all attached MTU-s for
   the originating PE-rs.

2.3.  MAC Flush in PBB-VPLS

   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model] describes how PBB can be
   integrated with VPLS to allow for useful PBB capabilities while
   continuing to avoid the use of MSTP in the backbone.  The combined
   solution referred to as "PBB-VPLS" results in better scalability in
   terms of number of service instances, PWs and C-MACs that need to be
   handled in the VPLS PE-rs devices.  This document describes
   extensions to LDP MAC Flush procedures described in [RFC4762]
   required to build desirable capabilities to PBB-VPLS solution.

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


   The solution proposed in this document is generic and is applicable
   when MS-PWs are used in interconnecting PE devices in H-VPLS.  There
   could be other H-VPLS models not defined in this document where the
   solution may be applicable.

           Figure 2: Dual homed MTU-s in two tier hierarchy H-VPLS

   In Figure 2, the MTU-s is dual-homed to PE1-rs and PE2-rs.  Only the
   primary spoke PW is active at MTU-s, thus PE1-rs is acting as the
   active device (designated forwarder) to reach the full mesh in the
   VPLS instance.  The MAC addresses of nodes located at access sites
   (behind CE1 and CE2) are learned at PE1-rs over the primary spoke PW.
   Let's say X represents a set of such MAC addresses located behind
   CE-1.  As packets flow from X to other MACs in the VPLS network,
   PE2-rs, PE3-rs and PE4-rs learn about X on their respective mesh PWs
   terminating at PE1-rs.  When MTU-s switches to the backup spoke PW
   and activates it, PE2-rs becomes the active device (designated
   forwarder) to reach the full mesh core for MTU-s.  Traffic entering
   the H-VPLS from CE-1 and CE-2 is diverted by the MTU-s to the spoke
   PW to PE2-rs.  Traffic destined from PE2-rs, PE3-rs and PE4-rs to X
   will be blackholed till MAC address aging timer expires (default is 5
   minutes) or a packet flows from X to other addresses through PE2-rs.

   For example, if after the backup spoke PW is active, if a packet
   flows from MAC Z to MAC X, packets from MAC Z travel from PE3-rs to
   PE-1rs and are dropped.  However, if a packet with MAC X as source
   and MAC Z as destination arrives at PE2-rs, PE2-rs will now learn MAC



Dutta, et al.            Expires August 29, 2013                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


   X is on the backup spoke PW and will forward to MAC Z. At this point
   traffic from PE3-rs to MAC X will go to PE2-rs, since PE-3rs has also
   learned about MAC X. Therefore a mechanism is required to make this
   learning more timely in cases where traffic is not bidirectional.

   To avoid traffic blackholing the MAC addresses that have been learned
   in the upstream VPLS full-mesh through PE1-rs, must be relearned or
   removed from the MAC FIBs in the VSIs at PE2-rs, PE3-rs and PE4-rs.
   If PE1-rs and PE2-rs are dual-homing agnostic then on activation of
   the standby PW from MTU-s, a MAC flush message will be sent by MTU-s
   to PE2-rs that will flush all the MAC addresses learned in the VPLS
   instance at PE2-rs from all the other PWs but the PW connected to
   MTU-s.

   PE2-rs further relays MAC flush messages to all other PE-rs devices
   in the full mesh.  The same processing rule applies at all those
   PE-rs devices: all the MAC addresses are flushed but the ones learned
   on the PW connected to PE2-rs.  For example, at PE3-rs all of the MAC
   addresses learned from the PWs connected to PE1-rs and PE4-rs are
   flushed and relearned subsequently.  Before the relearning happens
   flooding of unknown destination MAC addresses takes place throughout
   the network.  As the number of PE-rs devices in the full-mesh
   increases, the number of unaffected MAC addresses flushed in a VPLS
   instance also increases, thus leading to unnecessary flooding and
   relearning.  With large number of VPLS instances provisioned in the
   H-VPLS network topology the amount of unnecessary flooding and
   relearning increases.  An optimization, described below, is required
   that will flush only the MAC addresses learned from the respective
   PWs between PE1-rs and other PE devices in the full-mesh minimizing
   the relearning and flooding in the network.  In the example above,
   only the MAC addresses in set X and Y need to be flushed across the
   core.

   The same case is applicable when PE1-rs and PE2-rs are dual homing
   aware and participate in a designated forwarder election.  When
   PE2-rs becomes the active device for MTU-s then PE2-rs MAY initiate
   MAC flush towards the core.  The receiving action of the MAC Flush in
   other PE-rs devices is the same as in MTU-s initiated MAC Flush.
   This is the [RFC4762] specified behavior.

3.1.2.  MAC Flush Optimization for native Ethernet access

   The analysis in section 3.1.1 applies also to the native Ethernet
   access into a VPLS.  In such a scenario one active and one or more
   standby endpoints terminate into two or more VPLS or H-VPLS PE-rs
   devices.  Examples of these dual homed access are ITU-T [ITU.G8032]
   access rings or any proprietary multi-chassis LAG emulations.  Upon
   failure of the active native Ethernet endpoint on PE1-rs, an

   optimized MAC flush is required to be initiated by PE1-rs to ensure
   that on PE2-rs, PE3-rs and PE4-rs only the MAC addresses learned from
   the respective PWs connected to PE1-rs are being flushed.

3.2.  Black holing issue in PBB-VPLS

   In a PBB-VPLS deployment a B-component VPLS (B-VPLS) may be used as
   infrastructure to support one or more I-component instances.  The
   B-VPLS control plane (LDP Signaling) and learning of "Backbone" MACs
   (BMACs) replaces I-component control plane and learning of customer
   MACs (CMACs) throughout the MPLS core.  This raises an additional
   challenge related to black hole avoidance in the I-component domain
   as described in this section.  Figure 3 describes the case of a CE
   device (node A) dual-homed to two I-component instances located on
   two PBB-VPLS PEs (PE1-rs and PE2-rs).

   Figure 3: PBB Black holing Issue - CE Dual-Homing use case

   The link between PE1-rs and CE-A is active (marked with A) while the
   link between CE-A and PE2-rs is in Standby/Blocked status.  In the
   network diagram CMAC X is one of the MAC addresses located behind
   CE-A in the customer domain, CMAC Y is behind CE-B and the B-VPLS
   instances on PE1-rs are associated with BMAC B1 and PE2-rs with BMAC
   B2.

   As the packets flow from CMAC X to CMAC Y through PE1-rs with BMAC
   B1, the remote PE-rs devices participating in the B-VPLS with the
   same I-SID (for example, PE3-rs) will learn the CMAC X associated
   with BMAC B1 on PE1-rs.  Under a failure condition of the link
   between CE-A and PE1-rs and on activation of the link to PE2-rs, the
   remote PE-rs devices (for example, PE3-rs) will black-hole the
   traffic destined for customer MAC X to BMAC B1 until the aging timer
   expires or a packet flows from X to Y through the PE B2.  This may
   take a long time (default aging timer is 5 minutes) and may affect a

   large number of flows across multiple I-components.

   A possible solution to this issue is to use the existing LDP MAC
   Flush as specified in [RFC4762] to flush the BMAC associated with the
   PE-rs in the B-VPLS domain where the failure occurred.  This will
   automatically flush the CMAC to BMAC association in the remote PE-rs
   devices.  This solution has the disadvantage of producing a lot of
   unnecessary MAC flush in the B-VPLS domain as there was no failure or
   topology change affecting the Backbone domain.

   A better solution which propagates the I-component events through the
   backbone infrastructure (B-VPLS) is required in order to flush only
   the CMAC to BMAC associations in the remote PBB-VPLS capable PE-rs
   devices.  Since there are no I-component control plane exchanges
   across the PBB backbone, extensions to B-VPLS control plane are
   required to propagate the I-component MAC Flush events across the
   B-VPLS.


4.  Solution Description

   This section describes the solution for the requirements described in
   section 3.

4.1.  MAC Flush Optimization for VPLS Resiliency

   The basic principle of the optimized MAC flush mechanism is explained
   with reference to Figure 2.  The optimization is achieved by
   initiating MAC Flush on failure as described in section 2.2.

   PE1-rs would initiate MAC Flush towards the core on detection of
   failure of primary spoke PW between MTU-s and PE1-rs (or status
   change from active to standby [RFC6718] ).  This method is referred
   as "MAC Flush on Failure" throughout this document.  The MAC Flush
   message would indicate to receiving PE-rs devices to flush all MACs
   learned over the PW in the context of the VPLS for which the MAC
   flush message is received.  Each PE-rs device in the full mesh that
   receives the message identifies the VPLS instance and its respective
   PW that terminates in PE1-rs from the FEC TLV received in the message
   and/or LDP session.  Thus the PE-rs device flushes only the MAC
   addresses learned from that PW connected to PE1-rs, minimizing the
   required relearning and the flooding throughout the VPLS domain.

   This section defines a generic MAC Flush Parameters TLV for LDP
   [RFC5036].  Through out this document the MAC Flush Parameters TLV is
   referred as MAC Flush TLV.  A MAC Flush TLV carries information on
   the desired action at the PE-rs device receiving the message and is
   used for optimized MAC flushing in VPLS.  The MAC Flush TLV can also

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


   be used for [RFC4762] style of MAC Flush as explained in section 2.

4.1.1.  MAC Flush Parameters TLV

   The MAC Flush Parameters TLV is described as below:

   0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |1|1| MAC Flush Params TLV(TBD) |           Length              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Flags     | Sub-TLV Type  |         Sub-TLV Length        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                Sub-TLV Variable Length Value                  |
   |                             "                                 |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The U and F bits are set to forward if unknown so that potential
   intermediate VPLS PE-rs devices unaware of the new TLV can just
   propagate it transparently.  (In the case of an B-VPLS network that
   has PBB-VPLS in the core with no I-components attached this message
   can still be useful to edge B-VPLS that do have the I-components with
   the ISIDs and understand the message. ) The MAC Flush Parameters TLV
   type is to be assigned by IANA.  The encoding of the TLV follows the
   standard LDP TLV encoding in [RFC5036]

   The TLV value field contains a one byte Flag field used as described
   below.  Further the TLV value MAY carry one or more sub-TLVs.  Any
   sub-TLV definition to the above TLV MUST address the actions in
   combination with other existing sub-TLVs.

   The detailed format for the Flags bit vector is described below:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |C|N|    MBZ    | (MBZ = MUST Be Zero)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   1 Byte Flag field is mandatory.  The following flags are defined:

   C flag, used to indicate the context of the PBB-VPLS component in
   which MAC flush is required.  For PBB-VPLS there are two contexts of
   MAC flushing - The Backbone VPLS (B-component VPLS) and Customer VPLS
   (I-component VPLS).  C flag MUST be ZERO (C=0) when a MAC Flush for
   the B-VPLS is required.  C flag MUST be set (C=1) when the MAC Flush
   for I-component is required.  In the regular H-VPLS case the C flag
   MUST be ZERO (C=0) to indicate the flush applies to the current VPLS
   context.

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


   N flag, used to indicate whether a positive (N=0, Flush-all-but-mine)
   or negative (N=1 Flush-all-from-me) MAC Flush is required.  The
   source (mine/me) is defined either as the PW associated with the LDP
   session on which the LDP MAC Withdraw was received or with the
   BMAC(s) listed in the BMAC Sub-TLV.  For the optimized MAC Flush
   procedure described in this section the flag MUST be set (N=1).

   Detailed usage in the context of PBB-VPLS is explained in section
   4.2.

   MBZ flags, the rest of the flags SHOULD be set to zero on
   transmission and ignored on reception.

   The MAC Flush TLV SHOULD be placed after the existing TLVs in MAC
   Flush message in [RFC4762].

4.1.2.  Application of MAC Flush TLV in Optimized MAC Flush

   For optimized MAC flush, the MAC Flush TLV MAY be sent as in existing
   LDP Address Withdraw Message with empty MAC List but from the core
   PE-rs on detection of failure of its local/primary spoke PW.  The N
   bit in TLV MUST be set to 1 to indicate Flush-all-from-me.  If the
   optimized MAC Flush procedure is used in a Backbone VPLS or regular
   VPLS/H-VPLS context the C bit MUST be ZERO (C=0).  If it is used in
   an I-component context the C bit MUST be set (C= 1).  See section 4.2
   for details of its usage in PBB-VPLS context.

   Note that the assumption is the MAC flush TLV is understood by all
   devices before it is turned on in any network.  See Operational
   Considerations section 5.

   The MAC withdraw procedures defined in [RFC4762], MTU-s or PE2-rs
   SHOULD be sent in cases where the network is being upgraded and
   devices are not capable of understanding the optimized MAC flush.
   This would result in the same flushing action as [RFC4762] at the
   receiving PE-rs devices.

   For the case of B-VPLS devices optimized MAC flush message SHOULD be
   supported.

4.1.3.  MAC Flush TLV Processing Rules for Regular VPLS

   This section describes the processing rules of MAC Flush TLV that
   SHOULD be followed in the context of MAC flush procedures in VPLS.

   For optimized MAC Flush a multi-homing PE-rs initiates MAC flush
   message towards the other related VPLS PE-rs devices when it detects
   a transition (failure or to standby) in its active spoke PW.  In such



Dutta, et al.            Expires August 29, 2013               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


   case the MAC Flush TLV MUST be sent with N= 1.  A PE-rs device
   receiving the MAC Flush TLV SHOULD follow the same processing rules
   as described in this section.

   Note that if MS-PW is used in VPLS then a MAC flush message is
   processed only at the T-PE nodes since S-PE(s) traversed by the MS-PW
   propagate MAC flush messages without any action.  In this section, a
   PE-rs device signifies only T-PE in MS-PW case unless specified
   otherwise.

   When a PE-rs device receives a MAC Flush TLV with N = 1, it SHOULD
   flush all the MAC addresses learned from the PW in the VPLS in the
   context on which the MAC Flush message is received.

   If a MAC Flush TLV is received with N = 0 in the MAC flush message
   then the receiving PE-rs SHOULD flush the MAC addresses learned from
   all PWs in the VPLS instance except the ones learned over the PW on
   which the message is received.

   If a PE-rs device receives a MAC flush with the MAC Flush TLV option
   and a valid MAC address list, it SHOULD ignore the option and deal
   with MAC addresses explicitly as per [RFC4762].  It is assumed when
   these procedures are used all nodes support the MAC Flush Message.
   See section 5 Operational Considerations for details.

4.1.4.  Optimized MAC Flush Procedures

   This section explains the optimized MAC flush procedure in the
   scenario in Figure 2.  When the primary spoke PW transition (failure
   or standby transition) is detected by PE1-rs, it MAY send MAC flush
   messages to PE2-rs, PE3-rs and PE4-rs with MAC Flush TLV and N = 1.
   Upon receipt of the MAC flush message, PE2-rs identifies the VPLS
   instance that requires MAC flush from the FEC element in the FEC TLV.
   On receiving N=1, PE-2 removes all MAC addresses learned from that PW
   over which the message is received.  The same action is followed by
   PE3-rs and PE4-rs.

   Figure 4 shows another redundant H-VPLS topology to protect against
   failure of MTU-s device.  Provider RSTP [IEEE.802.1Q-2011] may be
   used as selection algorithm for active and backup PWs in order to
   maintain the connectivity between MTU-s devices and PE-rs devices at
   the edge.  It is assumed that PE-rs devices can detect failure on PWs
   in either direction through OAM mechanisms such as VCCV procedures
   for instance.

                  Figure 4: Redundancy with Provider RSTP

   MTU-1, MTU-2, PE1-rs and PE2-rs participate in provider RSTP.  By
   configuration in RSTP it is ensured that the PW between MTU-1 and
   PE1-rs is active and the PW between MTU-2 and PE2-rs is blocked (made
   backup) at MTU-2 end.  When the active PW failure is detected by
   RSTP, it activates the PW between MTU-2 and PE2-rs.  When PE1-rs
   detects the failing PW to MTU-1, it MAY trigger MAC flush into the
   full mesh with MAC Flush TLV that carries N=1.  Other PE-rs devices
   in the full mesh that receive the MAC flush message identify their
   respective PWs terminating on PE1-rs and flush all the MAC addresses
   learned from it.

   [RFC4762] describes multi-domain VPLS service where fully meshed VPLS
   networks (domains) are connected together by a single spoke PW per
   VPLS service between the VPLS "border" PE-rs devices.  To provide
   redundancy against failure of the inter-domain spoke, full mesh of
   inter-domain spokes can be setup between border PE-rs devices and
   provider RSTP may be used for selection of the active inter-domain
   spoke.  In case of inter-domain spoke PW failure, PE-rs initiated MAC
   withdrawal MAY be used for optimized MAC flushing within individual
   domains.

   Further, the procedures are applicable with any native Ethernet
   access topologies multi-homed to two or more VPLS PE-rs devices.  The
   text in this section applies for the native Ethernet case where
   active/standby PWs are replaced with the active/standby Ethernet
   endpoints.  An optimized MAC Flush message can be generated by the
   VPLS PE-rs that detects the failure in the primary Ethernet access.

4.2.  LDP MAC Flush Extensions for PBB-VPLS

   The use of Address Withdraw message with MAC List TLV is proposed in
   [RFC4762] as a way to expedite removal of MAC addresses as the result
   of a topology change (e.g. failure of a primary link of a VPLS PE-rs
   device and implicitly the activation of an alternate link in a dual-
   homing use case).  These existing procedures apply individually to
   B-VPLS and I-component domains.

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


   When it comes to reflecting topology changes in access networks
   connected to I-component across the B-VPLS domain certain additions
   should be considered as described below.

   MAC Switching in PBB is based on the mapping of Customer MACs (CMACs)
   to Backbone MAC(s) (BMACs).  A topology change in the access
   (I-domain) should just invoke the flushing of CMAC entries in PBB
   PEs' FIB(s) associated with the I-component(s) impacted by the
   failure.  There is a need to indicate the PBB PE (BMAC source) that
   originated the MAC Flush message to selectively flush only the MACs
   that are affected.

   These goals can be achieved by including the MAC Flush Parameters TLV
   in the LDP Address Withdraw message to indicate the particular
   domain(s) requiring MAC flush.  On the other end, the receiving PEs
   SHOULD use the information from the new TLV to flush only the related
   FIB entry/entries in the I-component instance(s).

   At least one of the following sub-TLVs MUST be included in the MAC
   Flush Parameters TLV if the C-flag is set to 1:

   o  PBB BMAC List Sub-TLV:

   Type: 0x01 IANA TBA

   Length: value length in octets.  At least one BMAC address MUST be
   present in the list.

   Value: one or a list of 48 bits BMAC addresses.  These are the source
   BMAC addresses associated with the B-VPLS instance that originated
   the MAC Withdraw message.  It will be used to identify the CMAC(s)
   mapped to the BMAC(s) listed in the sub-TLV.

   o  PBB ISID List Sub-TLV:

   Type: 0x02, IANA TBA

   Length: value length in octets.  Zero indicates an empty ISID list.
   An empty ISID list means that the flush applies to all the ISIDs
   mapped to the B-VPLS indicated by the FEC TLV.

   Value: one or a list of 24 bits ISIDs that represent the I-component
   FIB(s) where the MAC Flush needs to take place.

4.2.1.  MAC Flush TLV Processing Rules for PBB-VPLS

   The following steps describe the details of the processing rules for
   MAC Flush TLV in the context of PBB-VPLS:



Dutta, et al.            Expires August 29, 2013               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


   The MAC Flush can be for the B-VPLS B-component (which applies to the
   BMACs and the corresponding CMACs) or the B-VPLS I-component (which
   applies to the CMACs) which is described in more detail here.

   - The MAC Flush Message, including the MAC Flush Parameters TLV is
   initiated by the PBB PE(s) experiencing a Topology Change event in
   one or multiple customer I-component(s).

   - The flags are set accordingly to indicate the type of MAC Flush
   required for this event: For example for an B-VPLS I-Component N=0
   (Flush-all-but-mine), C=1 (Flush only CMAC FIBs).

   - The PBB Sub-TLVs (BMAC and ISID Lists) are included according to
   the context of topology change.

   - On reception of the MAC Flush message, the B-VPLS instances
   corresponding to the FEC TLV in the message must interpret the
   content of MAC Flush Parameters TLV.  If the C-bit is set to 1 then
   Backbone Core Bridges (BCB) in the PBB-VPLS SHOULD NOT flush their
   BMAC FIBs.  The B-VPLS control plane SHOULD propagate the MAC Flush
   following the data-plane split-horizon rules to the established
   B-VPLS topology.

   - The usage and processing rules of MAC Flush Parameters TLV in the
   context of Backbone Edge Bridges (BEB) is as follows:

   - The PBB ISID List is used to determine the particular ISID FIBs
   (I-component) that need to be considered for flushing action.  If the
   PBB ISID List sub-tlv is not included in a received message then all
   the ISID FIBs associated with the receiving B-VPLS SHOULD be
   considered for flushing action.

   - The PBB BMAC List is used to identify from the ISID FIBs in the
   previous step to selectively flush BMAC to CMAC associations
   depending on the N flag specified below.  If PBB BMAC List Sub-TLV is
   not included in a received message then all BMAC to CMAC association
   in all ISID FIBs (I-component) as specified by the ISID List are
   considered for required flushing action, again depending on the N
   flag specified below.

   - Next, depending on the N flag value the following actions apply:

   - N=0, all the CMACs in the selected ISID FIBs SHOULD be flushed with
   the exception of the resulted CMAC list from the BMAC List mentioned
   in the message.  ("Flush all but the CMACs associated with the
   BMAC(s) in the BMAC List Sub-TLV from the FIBs associated with the
   ISID list").




Dutta, et al.            Expires August 29, 2013               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     Optimized MAC Withdrawal in H-VPLS      February 2013


   - N=1, all the resulted CMACs SHOULD be flushed ("Flush all the CMACs
   associated with the BMAC(s) in the BMAC List Sub-TLV from the FIBs
   associated with the ISID list").

4.2.2.  Applicability of MAC Flush Parameters TLV

   If MAC Flush Parameters TLV is received by a BEB in a PBB-VPLS that
   does not understand the TLV then it may result in undesirable MAC
   flushing action.  It is RECOMMENDED that all PE-rs devices
   participating in PBB-VPLS support MAC Flush Parameters TLV.  If this
   is not possible the MAC Flush Parameters TLV SHOULD be disabled as
   mentioned in section 5 Operational Considerations.

   The MAC Flush Parameters TLV is also applicable to regular VPLS
   context as well as explained in section 3.1.1.  To achieve negative
   MAC Flush (flush-all-from-me) in regular VPLS context, the MAC Flush
   Parameters TLV SHOULD be encoded with C=0 and N = 1 without inclusion
   of any Sub-TLVs.  Negative MAC flush is highly desirable in scenarios
   when VPLS access redundancy is provided by Ethernet Ring Protection
   as specified in ITU-T [ITU.G8032]specification etc.


5.  Operational Considerations

   As mentioned before, if MAC Flush Parameters TLV is not understood by
   a receiver then it would result in undesired flushing action.  To
   avoid this one solution is to develop an LDP based capability
   negotiation mechanism to negotiate support of various MAC Flushing
   capability between PE-rs devices in a VPLS instance.  A negotiation
   mechanism is outside the scope of this document but is not required
   to deploy this optimized MAC flush as described below.

   VPLS may be used with or without the optimization.  For the case of
   PBB-VPLS this operation is the only method supported for ISIDs.  If
   an operator wants the optimizations for VPLS it is the operators
   responsibility to make sure the VPLS that are capable of supporting
   the optimization are properly configured.  From operational
   standpoint, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations of the solution
   provide administrative control to select the desired MAC Flushing
   action towards a PE-rs device in the VPLS.  Thus in the topology
   figure 2. it is possible that PE1-rs would initiate optimized MAC
   Flush towards the PE-rs devices that supports the solution , whereas
   PE2-rs would initiate [RFC4762] style of MAC Flush towards the PE-rs
   devices that does not support the optimized solution.  The PE-rs that
   supports the MAC Flush Parameters TLV MUST support the RFC4762 MAC
   flush procedure for completeness.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests code point for following LDP TLV:

   o  MAC Flush Parameters TLV.

   Also this document requests two Sub-TLV values for

   o  PBB BMAC List Sub-TLV 0x01 IANA TBA

   o  PBB ISID List Sub-TLV 0x02 IANA TBA


7.  Security Considerations

   Control plane aspects:

   - LDP security (authentication) methods as described in [RFC5036] is
   applicable here.  Further this document implements security
   considerations as in [RFC4447] and [RFC4762].

   Data plane aspects:

   - This specification does not have any impact on the VPLS forwarding
   plane.
