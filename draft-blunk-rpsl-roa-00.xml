    <abstract>
    <t>This document describes an attribute for Routing Policy Specification
Language (RPSL) route and route6 objects that documents the presense and
validity of a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) for the given prefix and
origin values contained within the object.  It allows parties who employ
Internet Routing Registries (IRR's) for routing policy configuration generation
to easily ascertain whether a given object has a ROA covering the object.
The primary objective is to enable existing IRR tools to make use of the ROA
information with minimal modifications.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
Objects stored in Internet Routing Registries are used by a number
of Internet Providers to generate router configurations.  The tools
they employ are based upon the RPSL format.  The IETF work within
the SIDR Working Group will likely require extensive
modifications to these existing tools in order to support new standards
such as the ROA which provides equivalent
functionality to the RPSL route and route6 objects.  However, the RPSL
standard provides a number of capabilities and object types which do
not yet have functional equivalents defined within the SIDR Working
Group.  Examples include RPSL objects such as aut-num's, as-set's, and route-set's.
It is likely that Internet Providers will wish to continue to use
the RPSL standard for some time, while potentially leveraging the work
that is being done in the SIDR Working Group to improve the security
and robustness of the RPSL information that is present in IRR's.

<section title="Specification of Requirements">
  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
  described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>
<section title="ROA Status Syntax and Semantics">
<t>
The ROA Status attribute is named "roa-status" (case insensitive) and
is a generated attribute.  An IRR user MUST NOT be permitted to submit
an object with the ROA Status attribute already present. It is dependent on the
routing registry service to securely verify the ROA Status and generate
the attribute for a given route or route6 object.  Further, the ROA
Status of an object must be periodically re-checked after initial
generation.  It is RECOMMENDED that
the ROA Status attribute be regenerated at least once per day.
</t>
<t>The ROA Status attribute consists of multiple fields.
These fields are structured in a sequence of name and value
pairs, separated by a semicolon ";" and a white space.  Collectively,
these fields make up the value of the ROA Status attribute.
The "name" part of such a component is always a single ASCII
character that serves as an identifier; the value is an ASCII string
the contents of which depend on the field type.
</t>
<t> Fields of the ROA Status attribute:</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
 <t>Version number of the ROA Status attribute (field "v").  This field is REQUIRED
    and MUST be set to "1".</t>

 <t>The ROA validity status (field "s") of the prefix and origin pair
    given in the route or route6 object.  This field is REQUIRED
    and MUST contain one of three possible values -- "valid",
    "invalid", or "unknown".
    These possible three values reflect the "validity state"
    of the prefix/origin pair following <xref target="RFC6483">RFC 6483</xref>.</t>

 <t>ROA Max length (field "m").  For objects with a "valid" ROA Status,
    this fields contains the value of maxlength in the ROA covering
    the prefix in the route or route6 object, if present.
    If the covering ROA does not contain a maxlength value, this field MUST be
    omitted.</t>

 <t>Time ROA cache last refreshed (field "t"). 
    This field is REQUIRED and represents
    the last time the ROA cache data used to determine the "status"
    field value was refreshed. The time is expressed in <xref target="RFC3339">RFC 3339</xref>
    Internet time format.  The timestamp is expected to contain
    the time of the last successful cache refresh and is used to
    indicate the freshness of the status check.</t>

 <t>ROA URI (field "u").  This is an OPTIONAL field which SHOULD be provided
    upon request.   Whois servers may choose to use a query flag as
    a signal to provide this field in the whois output.  The field
    contains an <xref target="RFC5781">RFC 5781</xref> rsync reference to a ROA.
    In the case of a "valid" status, the field contains the URI for
    ROA that was used to validate the prefix/origin pair in the object.
    For an "invalid" status, the will be at least
    one, and possibly multiple ROA's, with different origin AS fields
    which result in the invalid status.  In the case of multiple ROA's,
    there will be multiple "u" fields -- one for each ROA covering the
    prefix.  In the case of an "unknown" status, there are no covering
    ROA's and this field is omitted.</t>
</list></t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
RPSL objects stored in the IRR databases are public, and as such
there is no need for confidentiality.  Applications may wish to
validate the referenced ROA in the ROA-URI field for objects with
a "valid" ROA Status.  IRR objects are traditionally retreived by
the insecure whois TCP protocol and objects may be subject to modification
or deletion while in transith.  IRR operators may want to pursue more
secure protocols for query interfaces such as SSL.  Additionally, IRR
operators that provide their database in a bulk format for download may
wish to provide a digital signature for the database to verify it's
integrity.
