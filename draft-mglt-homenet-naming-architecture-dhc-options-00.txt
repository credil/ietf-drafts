              DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Options
       draft-mglt-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options-00.txt

Abstract

   The home network naming architecture as described in [I-D.mglt-
   homenet-front-end-naming-delegation] requires a complex naming
   configuration on the CPE.  This configuration MAY not be handled
   easily by the average end user.  Furthermore, such misconfiguration
   MAY result in making home network unreachable.

   This document proposes a DHCP options that provide the CPE all
   necessary parameters to set up the home network naming architecture.

   First, this DHCP options provide automatic configuration and avoid
   most end users' misconfiguration.  Most average end users may not
   require specific configuration, and their ISP default configuration
   MAY fully address their needs.  In that case, the naming homenet
   architecture configuration will be completely transparent to the end
   users.  Then, saving naming configuration outside the CPE, makes it
   resilient to change of CPE or CPE upgrades.  Such configuration may
   also be configured by the end user, via the customer area of their
   ISP.

2.  Terminology

   - Customer Premises Equipment:  (CPE) is the router providing
         connectivity to the home network.  It is configured and managed
         by the end user.  In this document, the CPE MAY also hosts

         services such as DHCPv6.  This device MAY be provided by the
         ISP.

   -  Registered Homenet Domain:  is the Domain Name associated to the
         home network.

   - DNS Homenet Zone:  is the DNS zone associated to the home network.
         This zone is set by the CPE and essentially contains the
         bindings between names and IP addresses of the nodes of the
         home network.  In this document, the CPE does neither perform
         any DNSSEC management operations such as zone signing nor
         provide an authoritative service for the zone.  Both are
         delegated to the Public Authoritative Server.  The CPE
         synchronizes the DNS Homenet Zone with the Public Authoritative
         Server via a hidden master / slave architecture.  The Public
         Authoritative Server MAY use specific servers for the
         synchronization of the DNS Homenet Zone: the Public
         Authoritative Name Server Set.

   - Public Authoritative Server:  performs DNSSEC management operations
         as well as provides the authoritative service for the zone.  In
         this document, the Public Authoritative Server synchronizes the
         DNS Homenet Zone with the CPE via a hidden master / slave
         architecture.  The Public Authoritative Server acts as a slave
         and MAY use specific servers called Public Authoritative Name
         Server Set.  Once the Public Authoritative Server synchronizes
         the DNS Homenet Zone, it signs the zone and generates the
         DNSSEC Public Zone.  Then the Public Authoritative Server hosts
         the zone as an authoritative server on the Public Authoritative
         Master(s).

   - DNSSEC Public Zone:  corresponds to the signed version of the DNS
         Homenet Zone.  It is hosted by the Public Authoritative Server,
         which is authoritative for this zone, and is reachable on the
         Public Authoritative Master(s).

   - Public Authoritative Master(s):  are the visible name server
         hosting the DNSSEC Public Zone.  End users' resolutions for the
         Homenet Domain are sent to this server, and this server is a
         master for the zone.

   - Public Authoritative Name Server Set:  is the server the CPE
         synchronizes the DNS Homenet Zone.  It is configured as a slave
         and the CPE acts as master.  The CPE sends information so the
         DNSSEC zone can be set and served.

   With IPv6, nodes inside the home network are expected to be globally
   reachable.  CPEs are already providing connectivity to the home
   network, and most of the time already assigns IP addresses to the
   nodes of the home network using for example DHCPv6.

   This makes CPE good candidate for defining the DNS zone file of the
   home network.  However, CPEs have not been designed to handle heavy
   traffic, nor heavy operations.  As a consequence, CPE SHOULD neither
   host the authoritative naming service of the home network, nor handle
   DNSSEC operations such as zone signing.  In addition, CPE are usually
   managed by end users, and the average end user is most likely not
   mastering DNSSEC to administrate its DNSSEC zone.  As a result, CPE
   SHOULD outsource both the naming authoritative service and its DNSSEC
   management operations to a third party.  This architecture,
   designated as the homenet naming architecture is described in [I-D
   .mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation], and the third party is
   designated as the Public Authoritative Servers.

   The home network naming architecture  [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-
   naming-delegation] defines how the CPE and the Public Authoritative
   Servers interact together, to leverage some of the issues related to
   the CPE, and the DNSSEC understanding of the average end user.  Even
   though most of the DNSSEC issues are outsourced to the Public
   Authoritative Servers, setting the homenet naming architecture still
   requires some configurations.

   Configuration is fine as it provides the opportunity for advanced end
   users to make the naming architecture fit their specific needs.
   However most of the end users do not want to configure the homenet
   naming architecture.  In most cases, the end users wants to subscribe
   and plug its CPE.  The CPE is expected to be configured to set
   automatically and transparently the appropriated home network naming
   architecture.

   Using DHCP options to provide the necessary parameters for setting
   the homenet naming architecture provides multiple advantages.
   Firstly, it makes the network configuration independent of the CPE.
   Any new plugged CPE configures itself according to the provided
   configuration parameters.  Secondly, it saves the configuration
   outside the CPE, which prevents re-configuring the CPE when it is
   replaced or reset.  Finally ISPs are likely to propose a default
   homenet naming architecture that may address most of the end users
   needs.  For these end users, no configuration will be performed at
   any time.  This avoids unnecessary configurations or misconfiguration
   that could result in isolating the home network.  For more advanced
   end users, the configuration MAY be provided also via the web GUI of
   the ISP's customer area for example.  This configuration MAY enable
   third party Public Authoritative Servers.  By doing so, these end

   users will also benefit from CPE-indepedent configuration and
   configuration backup.

   This document considers the architecture described in [I-D.mglt-
   homenet-front-end-naming-delegation].  The DNS(SEC) zone related to
   the home network is configured and set by the CPE and hosted on a
   Public Authoritative Server.  [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-
   delegation] describes how the synchronization between the CPE and the
   Public Authoritative Server is performed.  This document describes
   DHCP options that provide the necessary parameters to the CPE to set
   the architecture described in [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-
   delegation].

   Section 4 presents an overview of the DHCP options presented in this
   document and Section 5 describes the format of this option and
   Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 details the behavior of
   respectively the DHCP Client, the DHCP Server and the DHCP Relay.

   This document assumes the reader is familiar with [I-D.mglt-homenet-
   front-end-naming-delegation].

   This document assumes that the communication between the CPE and the
   ISP DHCP Server is protected.  This document does not specify which
   mechanism should be used.  [RFC3315] proposes a DHCP authentication
   and message exchange protection, [RFC4301], [RFC5996] proposes to
   secure the channel at the IP layer.

   This document only deals with IPv6 IP addresses and DHCPv6 [RFC3315].
   When we mention DHCP, it MUST be understood as DHCPv6.

4.  Protocol Overview

   To properly configure the home network naming architecture defined in
   [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation], the CPE MUST:

   - 1:  Determine which Registered Domain are considered.  Each
         Registered Domain is associated to a DNS Zone file.  Note that
         a CPE MAY publish a single zone under different Registered
         Domain Names, or set different contents on different Registered
         Domain Names.

Internet-Draft      DHCP Public Auth. Server Options        October 2013


   - 2:  Properly generate the DNS Zone file and associate the
         corresponding authoritative Name Server (RRset NS) with
         associated  IP addresses (RRsets A or AAAA).  The CPE derives
         the NS RRset from the Registered Domain and the Public
         Authoritative Master.  Then it MAY derive the glue A or AAAA
         records from the Public Authoritative Master and associated IP
         addresses.  These pieces of information are provided by the
         DHCP Zone Public Master Option (OPTION_ZONE_PUBLIC_MASTER).

   - 3:  Upload the Zone files to the Public Authoritative Master.
         Uploading the DNS Homenet Zone or the DNSSEC Homenet Zone may
         not be done directly from the CPE to the Public Authoritative
         Masters.  In fact, the Public Authoritative Server MAY have a
         dedicated server for DNS zone uploads: the Public Authoritative
         Name Server Set.  One of the reason is that the Public
         Authoritative Server MAY perform some extra operations such as
         the DNSSEC signing before publishing the DNSSEC Homenet Zone to
         on the Public Authoritative Masters.  As a result, for each
         Public Authoritative Master a secure channel MUST be
         established between the CPE and the Public Authoritative Name
         Server Set.  How to set, for each Public Authoritative Master,
         the secure channel to the Public Authoritative Name Server Set
         is provided by the DHCP Public Master Upload Option
         (OPTION_PUBLIC_MASTER_UPLOAD).

   A common way for the CPE to collect these pieces of information is to
   send an Option Request DHCP Option (ORO) [RFC3315] for the DHCP DNS
   Public Authoritative Server Option and for the DNS Public
   Authoritative Name Server Set Option.  If the DHCP Sever understand
   these options, it MAY send back one or multiple instance for each
   option.  Then, the DHCP Client sets the naming architecture.

   Similarly, the DHCP Server MAY provide the DHCP DNS Public
   Authoritative Server Option and for the DNS Public Authoritative Name
   Server Set Option without any request from the DHCP Client.

   Note that how the CPE manage the multiple DNS Homenet Zones is
   implementation dependent.  It MAY synchronize all DNS Homenet Zone
   with the Public Authoritative Servers, or use zone redirection
   mechanisms like like CNAME [RFC2181], [RFC1034], DNAME [RFC6672] or
   CNAME+DNAME [I-D.sury-dnsext-cname-dname].  In the first case, any
   update requires to update all zone, whereas redirection MAY require
   only updating a single DNS Homenet Zone.

   The DHCP Zone Public Master Option (OPTION_ZONE_PUBLIC_MASTER) is
   used by the CPE to set the DNS Homenet Zone with the proper NS RRsets
   and the associated IP addresses.  The DHCP Zone Public Master Option
   provides bindings between Registered Domain Names and Public
   Authoritative Master.

   Following Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines], the DHCP
   Zone Master Option encapsulates the DHCP Registered Domain Name
   Option (OPTION_REGISTERED_DOMAIN_NAMES) that contains a list of
   registered domain names and the Public Authoritative DHCP Master
   Option (OPTION_MASTER) that contains the FQDNs and IP addresses of
   each Public Authoritative Masters.

5.1.1.  Unpacking a DHCP Zone Public Master Option

   When a DHCP Zone Public Master Option is received by the DHCP Client,
   if the DHCP Registered Domain Name Option does not exist or is void,
   the CPE ignores the DHCP Zone Public Master Option.  It MAY indicate
   the DHCP Server supports these options but they are not properly
   configured.  Otherwise, it selects all DNS Homenet Zone designated by
   the DHCP Registered Domain Name Option and adds the Public
   Authoritative NS, A and AAA records provided by the DHCP Master
   Option.  If DHCP Master Option are missing, the CPE hosts the DNS
   Homenet Zone for the Registered Domains.

   All DHCP Options are propositions.  The CPE MAY chose a subset of
   these according to its policies.

   Section 13 illustrates with pseudo code how this MAY be performed.

5.1.2.  Packing a DHCP Zone Public Master Option

   The DHCP Server sends a DHCP Zone Public Master Option to bind
   Registered Domain Names to a list of Public Authoritative Masters.
   How to collect these pieces of information is implementation
   dependent, and depends on the data structure that stores the
   information.  However, we can reasonably assume that sending a DHCP
   Zone Public Master Option is composed of two phases:

   - 1)  First collect all Registered Domain with their associated list
         of Public Authoritative Masters.  Basic implementation MAY
         build DHCP Zone Public Master Option for each Registered
         Domain.  However, we recommend to group all Registered Domain
         with the same list of Public Authoritative Masters.  This leads
         to a list of Registered Domain associated to a list of Public
         Authoritative Masters.  Note that lists of Public Authoritative
         Masters are equals if they have the same Public Authoritative
         Masters, that is for each of them the same FQDN and the same
         list of IP addresses.  The list is not ordered.

   - 2)  Then, for each binding build a new DHCP Zone Public Master
         Option, build DHCP Registered Domain Name Option from the list
         of Registered Domains, add it to the DHCP Zone Public Master
         Option.  For each Public Authoritative Master of the list of
         Authoritative Masters, build a DHCP Master Option and add it to
         the  DHCP Zone Public Master Option.

   Section 13 illustrates with pseudo code how this MAY be performed.

5.1.3.1.  Unpacking a DHCP Registered Domain Name Option

   The DHCP Registered Domain Name Option MAY return one or multiple
   Registered Domain Names.  The DHCP Client MUST remove empty strings
   from the list.

5.1.3.2.  Packing a DHCP Registered Domain Name Option

   The DHCP Registered Domain Name Option is build from a list of non-

         associated to the Public Authoritative Server.  This option is
         optional, however the DHCP server SHOULD provide at least one
         DHCP Master IP4 Option or one DHCP Master IP6 Option.

   - OPTION_MASTER_IP6: the DHCP Master IP6 Option with IPv6 address
         associated to the Public Authoritative Server.  This option is
         optional, however the DHCP server SHOULD provide at least one
         DHCP Master IP6 Option or one DHCP Master IP6 Option.

5.1.4.1.  Unpacking a DHCP Master Option

   The DHCP Master FQDN Option is mandatory, and a DHCP Master Option
   that do not encapsulate a DHCP Master FQDN Option MUST be ignored.
   An empty DHCP Master FQDN Option indicates the CPE and a FQDN MUST be
   provided by the CPE.  DHCP Master IP4 Options and DHCP Master IP6
   Options are optional.  Following Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-

   guidelines], providing IP addresses avoids DNS(SEC) resolutions which
   unnecessarily load the network and delay the configuration.  As a
   result, it is recommended to provide the IP addresses.  If at least a
   single non void DHCP Master IP4 Option or DHCP Master IP6 Option is
   provide, the DHCP Client MUST NOT perform any DNS(SEC) resolution.
   Otherwise, the DHCP Client SHOULD perform a DNSSEC resolution.

   Section 13 illustrates with pseudo code how this MAY be performed.

5.1.4.2.  Packing a DHCP Master Option

   DHCP Master Options are built from the master object.  If the FQDN of
   the Public Authoritative Master is empty, the DHCP Master Option MUST
   NOT be built.  If no IP address has been provisioned, the DHCP Server
   SHOULD perform a DNS(SEC) resolution and provide the IP addresses.

   Section 13 illustrates with pseudo code how this MAY be performed.

5.1.4.3.  DHCP Master FQDN Option

   The DHCP Master FQDN Option (OPTION_MASTER_FQDN) designates the FQDN

5.2.  DHCP Public Master Upload Option

   The DHCP Public Master Upload Option (OPTION_PUBLIC_MASTER_UPLOAD) is
   used to associate a secure channel for each Public Authoritative
   Master.

   More specifically, to publish a DNS Homenet Zone on a given Public
   Authoritative Master, the CPE establish a secure channel with the
   Public Authoritative Name Server Set and upload the DNS Homenet Zone
   using master / slave mechanisms.  It is then the responsibility of
   the Public Authoritative Name Server Set to publish the DNS Homenet
   Zone to its associated Public Authoritative Masters.

   The DHCP Public Master Upload Option enables the CPE to set an
   address book where the key is the Public Authoritative and the value
   is a set of Secure Channels.  For each DNS(SEC) Homenet Zone, the CPE
   is expect to list the Public Authoritative Master and for each of
   them upload the DNS(SEC) Homenet Zone file to the Public
   Authoritative Name Server Set via a Secure Channel.

   Following Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines], the DHCP
   Public Master Upload Option encapsulates a DHCP Master FQDN List
   Option (OPTION_MASTER_FQDN_LIST) that contains the list of the FQDNs
   of the Public Authoritative Master and a list of DHCP Secure Channel
   Options (OPTION_SECURE_CHANNEL) that list how the CPE can upload the
   DNS(SEC) Homenet Zone.  For each of the mentioned Public
   Authoritative Master, the CPE is expected to consider one of the DHCP
   Secure Channel Options to upload the Zone.

   The DHCP Master FQDN List Option is mandatory and MUST be unique.  At
   least one DHCP Secure Channel Options MUST be encapsulated.

5.2.1.  Unpacking a DHCP Public Master Upload Option

   When the DHCP Client receives a DHCP Public Master Upload Option, it
   builds a dictionary between, Public Authoritative Master FQDN and
   possible Secure Channels.  Secure Channel that do not correspond to
   the CPE policy, MAY be discarded.

   This binding will be used latter when the CPE uploads the DNS(SEC)
   Homenet Zone files.  Section 13 illustrates with pseudo code how this
   MAY be performed.

5.2.2.  Packing a DHCP Public Master Upload Option

   The DHCP Server SHOULD send at least a Secure Channel for each of the
   Public Authoritative Master.  All Public Authoritative Masters
   associated to the DHCP Client that are provided in a DHCP Zone Public
   Master Option MUST be mentioned in an DHCP Public Master Upload
   Option.

   Packing a DHCP Public Master Upload Option is performed in a similar
   way as the DHCP Zone Public Master Option.  A binding between the
   Public Authoritative Master and the Secure Channels is performed.
   Then, this dictionary is factorized as described in  Section 5.1.2.
   More specifically, all keys with the same value are grouped.

5.2.3.  DHCP Master FQDN List Option

   The DHCP Master FQDN List Option is similar to the DHCP Master FQDN
   Option except that it can indicate multiple Master FQDNs.

5.2.4.  DHCP Secure Channel Options

   The DHCP Secure Channel Option (OPTION_SECURE_CHANNEL) indicates:

   - 1:  How to secure the channel, that is to say which protocols are
         used to secure the channel.  This is indicated by the DHCP
         Secure Protocol Option (OPTION_SECURE_PROTOCOL).

   - 2:  The security credential used to set up the secure channel, that
         is to say the cryptographic material to authenticate the CPE
         and the Public Authoritative Name Server Set.  This is carried
         by the DHCP Secure Credential Option
         (OPTION_SECURE_CREDENTIAL).

   - 3:  The Public Authoritative Name Server Set the secure channel is
         established with, that is to say its IP addresses.  These IP
         addresses are carried by the DHCP Server Set Option
         (OPTION_SERVER_SET).

   Following Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines], the DHCP
   Secure Channel Option encapsulates the DHCP Secure Protocol Option,
   the DHCP Secure Credential Option and the DHCP Server Set Option.
   Each of these options is mandatory and MUST appear only once.

5.2.4.1.  Unpacking a DHCP Secure Channel Option

   When the DHCP Secure Channel Option is received, the DHCP Client MUST
   check that DHCP Secure Protocol Option, DHCP Secure Credential Option
   and DHCP Server Set Option are unique.  If not, the DHCP Client MUST
   ignore the DHCP Secure Channel Option.

   The DHCP Client MUST also check proposition match its policies and
   Secure Credentials match the Secure Protocol.

5.2.4.4.1.  DHCP PSK Credential Option

   The DHCP PSK Credential Option (OPTION_PSK_CREDENTIAL) contains the
   pre-shared key.  It can be used with IPsec, TSIG.  If SIG(0) is
   selected as a protocol, the DHCP server MUST NOT provide this option,
   and it MUST be ignored by the DHCP Client.

   Note that PSK MUST NOT be sent by the DHCP Server over an non trusted
   channel.  In addition a DHCP Server SHOULD NOT provide the PSK unless
   requested explicitly by the DHCP Client.  Similarly, the DHCP Client
   MUST NOT request the PSK if the channel between the DHCP Client and
   the DHCP Server is not trusted.

   This option follows recommendation of section 5.9 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-
   option-guidelines].

5.2.4.5.  DHCP Server Set Option

   The DHCP Server Set Option (OPTION_SERVER_SET) carries the IP
   addresses of the Public Authoritative Name Server Set.  It is
   recommended to have one IP address, and eventually two if the Public
   Authoritative Server is dual stack.  In any case no more than one IP
   address of each family is expected.  The use of IP addresses instead
   of FQDN follows recommendation of [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines]
   section 8.

   The DHCP Server Set Option encapsulates the DHCP Server Set IP4
   Option (OPTION_SERVER_SET_IP4) and the DHCP Server Set IP6 Option
   (OPTION_SERVER_SET_IP6).

6.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   The DHCPv6 server MAY send DHCP Zone Public Master Option and/or DHCP
   Public Master Upload Option upon receiving or not a DHCP Option
   Request Option (ORO) by the DHCP Client.

   The DHCP Server MAY send zero, one or multiple DHCP Zone Public
   Master Option or DHCP Public Master Upload Option.

   The DHCP Server MUST send these option over a trusted channel.  The
   PSK MUST NOT be sent over a non trusted channel.

   If the DHCP Server is not provisioned properly, it SHOULD send empty
   DHCP Zone Public Master Option or DHCP Public Master Upload Option to
   indicate it supports the options, but they are not provisioned
   properly.

   Although DHCP Zone Public Master Option and DHCP Public Master Upload
   Option are different options, they MAY be used together by the DHCP
   Client.  Unless there are good reasons, DHCP Servers SHOULD provide
   in their DHCP Public Master Upload Option a Secure Channel for all
   Public Authoritative Masters mentioned in the DHCP Zone Public Master
   Option.  In other words, for all Public Authoritative Masters
   mentioned in the DHCP Zone Public Master Option, the DHCP Server
   SHOULD send a DHCP Public Master Upload Option that provides a Secure
   Channel.

7.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior



Migault (Ed), et al.     Expires April 23, 2014                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft      DHCP Public Auth. Server Options        October 2013


7.1.  Sending an ORO

   The DHCPv6 Client MAY enable different policies to configure the Home
   Network Naming Architecture.  More specifically, it MAY allow an end
   user to set manually a specific naming configuration, which may
   disable automatic configuration of the Home Network Naming
   Architecture.  If automatic configuration of the Home Network is not
   considered, the CPE SHOULD NOT send a DHCP Option Request Option
   (ORO) from the CPE for a DHCP DNS Public Authoritative Server Option
   or for a DHCP Public Master Upload Option.  This would otherwise
   unnecessarily load the DHCPv6 Server of the ISP and the network.

   The DHCP Client SHOULD NOT send and ORO for a DHCP Zone Public Master
   Option or a DHCP Public Master Upload Option if the channel between
   the DHCP Client and the DHCP Server is not trusted.

   By sending an DHCP Option Request Option (ORO) for a DHCP Zone Public
   Master Option or a DHCP Public Master Upload Option, the CPE
   indicates that the response received from the DHCP Server will define
   how the Naming Architecture of the CPE is configured.  However, this
   does not necessarily mean that the CPE will automatically configure
   its Naming Architecture according to according to the elements
   provided by the DHCPv6 Server.  In fact the CPE MAY implement various
   policies to configure the Naming Architecture.  Some policies MAY
   merge configuration manually provided by the end user and those
   provided by the DHCPv6 Server, others MAY only accept a subset of
   Public Authoritative Name Servers provided by the DHCPv6 Server.
   Defining the selection policies of the CPE is how of scope of this
   document.

   The remaining of the section describes how the DHCPv6 Client handles
   information received by the DHCPv6 Server to configure the Naming
   Architecture.  We assume that all information are considered.
   Although this document restricts the description to a single use
   case, we believe this will be the most common and basic use case.  In
   addition, other uses cases implementing different configuration
   policies only requires small modifications to the use case considered
   in this section.

7.2.  Receiving no DHCP Options

   If the DHCPv6 Client does not receive any DHCP Zone Public Master
   Option or DHCP Public Master Upload Option from the DHCPv6 Server.
   The DHCPv6 Client assumes the DHCPv6 Server does not support the
   option.  In this case, the Naming Architecture can only be set from
   local settings.

7.3.  Receiving empty DHCP Options

Internet-Draft      DHCP Public Auth. Server Options        October 2013


   By receiving empty DHCP Zone Public Master Option or empty DHCP
   Public Master Upload Option.  The DHCP Client assumes the DHCP Server
   supports these options, but they are not or badly provisioned.

7.4.  Receiving multiple DHCP Options

   The DHCPv6 Client MAY receive one or multiple DHCP Zone Public Master
   Option and/or DHCP Public Master Upload Option.  From these Option
   the CPE is expected to :

   - 1:  Collect all DHCP Zone Public Master Options.

   - 2:  Set the DNS Homenet Zone with the Public Authoritative Servers
         associated to each Registered Homenet Domain.  This includes
         setting NS and Public Authoritative Server A/AAA RRsets.  The
         CPE is expected to proceed to some checks so these RRSets are
         valid.

   - 3:  Collect all DHCP Public Master Upload Option.

   - 4:  Build the master_secure_channel_dict dictionary that associates
         to each Public Authoritative Master a list of possible secure
         channels.

   - 5:  Upload the DNS Homenet Zone to the Public Authoritative Name
         Server Set so the zone can be published on the corresponding
         Public Authoritative Servers.  The DNS(SEC) Homenet Zone is
         considered uploaded if for all Public Authoritative Masters of
         the DNS(SEC) Homenet Zone, upload (i.e.  master/slave
         synchronization) succeeded at least with one Secure Channel.
         If for a given Public Authoritative Master, upload fails with
         all its Secure Channel, it MUST be removed from the DNS(SEC)
         Homenet Zone and upload MUST restarted.  In other words
         synchronization MUST be performed again with all Public
         Authoritative Masters of the DNS(SEC) Homenet Zone (not only
         the remaining ones).

10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  DNSSEC is recommended to authenticate DNS hosted data

   The document describes how the Secure Delegation can be set between
   the Delegating DNS Server and the Delegated DNS Server.

   Deploying DNSSEC is recommended since in some cases the information
   stored in the DNS is used by the ISP or an IT department to grant
   access.  For example some Servers may performed a PTR DNS query to
   grant access based on host names.  With the described Delegating
   Naming Architecture, the ISP or the IT department MUST take into
   consideration that the CPE is outside its area of control.  As such,
   with DNS, DNS responses may be forged, resulting in isolating a
   Service, or not enabling a host to access a service.  ISPs or IT
   department may not base their access policies on PTR or any DNS
   information.  DNSSEC fulfills the DNS lack of trust, and we recommend
   to deploy DNSSEC on CPEs.

10.2.  Channel between the CPE and ISP DHCP Server MUST be secured

   In the document we consider that the channel between the CPE and the
   ISP DHCP Server is trusted.  More specifically, we suppose the CPE is
   authenticated and the exchanged messages are protected.  The current
   document does not specify how to secure the channel.  [RFC3315]
   proposes a DHCP authentication and message exchange protection,
   [RFC4301], [RFC5996] propose to secure the channel at the IP layer.

   In fact, the channel MUST be secured because the CPE provides
   necessary information for the configuration of the Naming Delegation.
   Unsecured channel may result in setting the Naming Delegation with an
   non legitimate CPE.  The non legitimate CPE would then be redirected
   the DNS traffic that is intended for the legitimate CPE.  This makes
   the CPE sensitive to three types of attacks.  The first one is the
   Deny Of Service Attack, if for example DNS traffic for a lot of CPEs
   are redirected to a single CPE.  CPE are even more sensitive to this
   attack since they have been designed for low traffic.  The other type
   of traffic is the DNS traffic hijacking.  A malicious CPE may
   redirect the DNS traffic of the legitimate CPE to one of its server.
   In return, the DNS Servers would be able to provide DNS Responses and
   redirect the End Users on malicious Servers.  This is particularly
   used in Pharming Attacks.  A third attack may consists in isolating a
   Home Network by misconfiguring the Naming Delegation for example to a
   non-existing DNS Server, or with a bad DS value.

10.3.  CPEs are sensitive to DoS

   The Naming Delegation Architecture involves the CPE that hosts a DNS
   Server for the Home Network.  CPE have not been designed for handling
   heavy load.  The CPE are exposed on the Internet, and their IP
   address is publicly published on the Internet via the DNS.  This
   makes the Home Network sensitive to Deny of Service Attacks.  The
   Naming Delegation Architecture described in this document does not
   address this issue.  The issue is addressed by [I-D.mglt-homenet-
   front-end-naming-delegation].
