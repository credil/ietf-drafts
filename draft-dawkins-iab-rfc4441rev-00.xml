        <section title="Introduction and Scope">
		<t>This document provides non-normative guidance to aid in the
			understanding of collaboration on standards development between 
   			Project 802 of the 
			Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
   			(IEEE) and the Internet Engineering Task
   			Force (IETF) of the Internet Society (ISOC).  Early identification of
   			topics of mutual interest will allow for constructive efforts between
   			the two organizations based on mutual respect.</t>

		<t>EDITOR'S NOTE: This version of the draft is very rough, and is being submitted so we have something concrete to talk about.</t>

        </section>



        <section title="Guidance on Collaboration">

        	<t>This section describes how the existing processes within the IETF and
			IEEE 802 may be utilized to enable collaboration between the organizations.</t>


        	<section title="Organization, Participation and Membership">

        		<t>IEEE 802 and IETF are similar in some ways, but different in others. When working on project that's of interest
				to both organizations, it's important to understand these differences.</t>

			
        		<section title="IEEE 802 Organization, Participation and Membership">
				<t>Standardization in IEEE 802 takes place within Working Groups operating under an Executive Committee. 
					Most Working Groups have one or more Task Groups.  A Task Group is responsible for a project or group of projects.  
					The IEEE 802 Executive Committee and Working Groups meet at plenary sessions in March, July and November. 
					Most Working Groups hold interim meetings, usually in January, April and September. 
					An IEEE 802 Orientation for new participants that gives an overview of IEEE 802 process is available.</t>

                               	<t>A good place to to learn more is <eref target="http://www.ieee802.org/">the IEEE 802 Home Page:</eref></t>

				<t>Participation in IEEE 802 Working Groups is by individual and is open. Individuals are required to declare their 
					affiliation. Working Groups maintain membership rosters, with voting membership attained and retained on the 
					basis of in-person meeting attendance. </t>

				<t>EDITOR'S NOTE: Do we need to explain "affiliation"? An individual is deemed "affiliated" with any individual or entity 
					that has been, or will be, financially or materially supporting that individual's participation in a particular IEEE 
					standards activity. This includes, but is not limited to, his or her employer and any individual or entity that has 
					or will have, either directly or indirectly, requested, paid for, or otherwise sponsored his or her participation.</t>
			</section>

        		<section title="IETF Organization, Participation and Membership">

				<t>In the IETF, work is done in working groups (WGs), mostly through
					open, public mailing lists rather than face-to-face meetings.  WGs			
					are organized into areas, each area being managed by two co-area
					directors.  Collectively, the area directors comprise the Internet
					Engineering Steering Group (IESG).</t>

				<t>Participation in the IETF is open to anyone (technically, anyone with access to e-mail sufficient to allow 
					subscription to one or more IETF mailing lists). All IETF participants act as individuals.
					There are a small number of IETF procedures that recognize organizations that may sponsor IETF participants,
					but these are organizational and do not apply to the standard specification process itself. 
					There is no concept of "IETF membership". </t>

                               	<t>A good place to to learn more is <eref target="http://www.ietf.org/">the IETF Home Page:</eref></t>

				<t>To foster ongoing communication between IEEE 802 and IETF, it is
					important to identify and establish contact points within each
					organization.  Contact points on the IETF side may include:</t>
				<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="10">
					<t hangText="IETF Area Director:"> An IETF area director is the individual responsible for overseeing
      						a major focus of activity (an "Area").  These positions are relatively long-
      						term (of several years) and offer the stability of contact points
      						between the two organizations for a given topic.</t>
					<t hangText="IETF Working Group Chair:"> An IETF working group chair is an individual who is assigned to
      						lead the work on a specific task within one particular area. These positions are
      						working positions (of a year or more) that typically end when the
     						work on a specific topic ends.  Collaboration here is very
      						beneficial to ensure the actual work gets done.</t>
					<t hangText="Other Contact Points:"> It may be beneficial to establish additional contact points for
      						specific topics of mutual interest.  These contact points should
     						be established early in the work effort, and in some cases the
      						contact point identified by each organization may be the same
      						individual.</t>
				</list></t>

				<t>Note: The current list of IETF area directors and working group
					chairs can be found in the IETF working group charters.</t>
			</section>
        	</section>


        	<section title="Exchange of information about new Work Items">

        		<t>The following sections outline a process that can be used to enable
   					each group to be informed about the other's active and proposed new work items.</t>


        		<section title="How IEEE 802 is informed about active IETF work items">
				<t>The responsibility is on individual IEEE 802 working groups to review the
   					current IETF working groups to determine if there are any topics of
   					mutual interest.  Working group charters and active Internet-Drafts
   					can be found on the IETF web site (http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/).
   					If an IEEE 802 working group identifies a common area of work, the 
					IEEE 802 working group
   					leadership should contact both the IETF working group chair and the
   					area director(s) responsible.  This may be accompanied by a formal
   					liaison statement (see Section X.X).</t>
			</section>
        		<section title="How IETF is informed about active IEEE 802 work items">
				<t>IEEE Working Group status reports are published at the beginning and end of each plenary at 
					<eref target="http://ieee802.org/minutes">on the IEEE802 website:</eref>. 
					Each Working Group includes a list of their active projects and the status. 
					The charter of an IEEE 802 project is defined in an approved Project Authorization Request (PAR). 
					PARs are accessible in <eref target="https://development.standards.ieee.org/my-site">IEEE Standards myProject:</eref>. 
					Access requires an IEEE web account which is free and has no membership requirement. In myProject, 
					a search on "View Active PARs" for 802 will bring up a list of all active IEEE 802 PARs. 
					If an IETF working group identifies a common area of work or a need for coordination, 
					the working group leadership should contact the IEEE 802 Working Group chair and Task Group chair. 
					This may be accompanied by a formal liaison statement (see Section xx).</t>
			</section>
        		<section title="How IEEE 802 is informed about proposed new IETF work items">
				<t>   The IETF maintains a mailing list for the distribution of proposed
   					new work items among standards development organizations.  Many such
   					items can be identified in proposed Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF)
   					sessions, as well as draft charters for working groups.  The IETF
   					forwards all such draft charters for all new and revised working
   					groups and BOF session announcements to the IETF new-work mailing
   					list.  An IEEE 802 mailing list is subscribed to this list. 
					Leadership of the IEEE working groups may subscribe to this IEEE 802 
					mailing list, which is maintained by the Executive Committee (EC). 
					Each IEEE 802 Working Group will delegate at least one expert to subscribe to this 
					list and be ready to dispatch any information relevant for their activity.  
   					This will enable the IEEE 802 working groups to monitor the new work items for possible overlap or
   					interest to their IEEE 802 working group.  It is expected that this mailing list
   					will see a few messages per month.</t>
				
				<t>Each IEEE 802 working group chairman, or designated representative, may provide comments
   					on these charters by responding to the IESG mailing list at
   					iesg@ietf.org clearly indicating their IEEE 802 position and the nature
   					of their concern.  Plain-text email is preferred on the IESG mailing
   					list. </t>

   				<t>It should be noted that the IETF turnaround time for new working
   					group charters can be as short as two weeks.  As a result, the
   					mailing list should be consistently monitored.</t>
			</section>
        		<section title="How IETF is informed about proposed new IEEE 802 work items">
				<t>An IEEE project is initiated by approval of a Project Authorization Request (PAR) 
					which includes a description of the scope of the work. Any IEEE 802 PARs which introduce new 
					functionality are required to be available for review no less than 30 days prior to the Monday of 
					the IEEE 802 plenary session where they will be considered.</t>

				<t>IEEE considers Five Criteria when deciding whether to approve new work: 
					Broad Market Potential, Compatibility, Distinct Identity and Technical Feasibility. 
					The criteria are defined in the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee (LMSC) Operations Manual. 
					The PARs are accompanied by responses on the 5 Criteria.</t>

				<t>Any comments on proposed PARs should be submitted to the Working Group chair and copied to the 
					Executive Committee chair by e-mail not later than 5:00 PM Tuesday of the plenary session 
					(in the time zone where the plenary is located).</t>

        	<section title="Document Access">

        		<t>During the course of IEEE 802 and IETF collaboration, 
				it is important to share internal documents among the technical working groups. 
				In addition, draft standards, Internet Drafts, and RFCs may also be distributed.</t>

			
        		<section title="IEEE 802 Documentation System">
				<t>Each IEEE 802 standardization project is assigned to a Working Group (WG) for development. 
					In IEEE 802, the working methods of the WGs vary in detail. The documentation system is 
					one area in which WG operations differ, based on varying needs and traditions. 
					In some cases, the WGs assign the core development to a subgroup (typically known as a 
					Task Group or Task Force), and the documentation procedures may vary among he subgroups as well. 
					Prior to project authorization, or on topics not directly related to development of a standard, 
					the WG may consider and develop documents itself, or using other subgroups (standing committees, 
					ad hocs, etc.). IEEE 802 also supports Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) that conduct business and 
					develop documents, although not standards. References here to WGs apply to TAGs as well. </t>

	        		<section title="IEEE 802 Documentation System">
					<t>In general, development of standards is IEEE 802 is contribution-driven. 
						Content toward draft standards is submitted to WGs by individual participants, 
						or groups of participants. Content toward other group documents (such as, for example, 
						external communication statements or foundation documents underlying a draft standard) 
						might also be contribution-driven. At some point, the group assembles contributed material 
						to develop group documents, and revision takes place within group meetings or by assignment 
						to editors. For the most part, the contributions toward discussion as well as the group 
						documents (including minutes and other reports) are openly available to the public.</t>

					<t>In general, development of standards is IEEE 802 is contribution-driven. 
						Content toward draft standards is submitted to WGs by individual participants, 
						or groups of participants. Content toward other group documents (such as, for example, 
						external communication statements or foundation documents underlying a draft standard) 
						might also be contribution-driven. At some point, the group assembles contributed material 
						to develop group documents, and revision takes place within group meetings or by assignment 
						to editors. For the most part, the contributions toward discussion as well as the group 
						documents (including minutes and other reports) are openly available to the public.</t>

					<t>Many IEEE 802 groups use a documentation system provided by IEEE and known as "Mentor". 
						The list of these groups is available at 
						<eref target="https://mentor.ieee.org/802">IEEE 802 Mentor Home Page:</eref>. 
						Mentor has some particularly notable aspects:</t>
						<t><list style="numbers">
							<t>The documentation system is structured and ordered, 
								with documentation tags and unique numbering and revisioning.</t>
							<t>On-line documentation is available.</t>
							<t>Generally speaking, the archives are publicly and freely available.</t>
							<t>Limited search functionality is provided, and publicly-available search engines index the data.</t>
							<t>The ability to submit documents to Mentor is limited but is generally available 
								to any interested party. An IEEE Account is required but can be easily and 
								freely established 
								<eref target="http://www.ieee.org/go/create_web_account">IEEE Account Request:</eref>. 
								If submission is protected, the privilege can be requested via the Mentor system 
								(using the "Join group" link on each WG Mentor page) and would typically be granted 
								by the WG documentation manager in a manual approval.</t>
							<t>Submitted documents are immediately available to the general public at the same instant 
								they become available for consideration by the group.</t>
						</list></t>
					<t>In most cases, WGs that use the Mentor system use it exclusively, so that any substantive document will 
						be available through the system. In a few cases (for example, the IEEE 802 Executive Committee), 
						document distribution is by multiple means (including an email reflector), so it may be difficult 
						to compile a complete set of documents.</t>

					<t>Some WGs do not use the Mentor system. In this case, documents are nevertheless generally publically 
						available and indexed. Typically, the index may be presented via a human-managed web site. 
						In such cases, the contributions may be submitted via email to a document manager, 
						so they may not be immediately available to the public. For WGs not using the Mentor system, 
						it should be relatively straightforward to find documents of interest by reviewing the group's 
						main web page, at <eref target="http://ieee802.org/[i]">IEEE 802 working group pages:</eref>, 
						where [i] is the one-digit or two-digit numerical 
						desigation for the WG or TAG. In some cases, links to documents may be available only 
						by reviewing the WG or subgroup meeting minutes.</t>
				</section>

	        		<section title="Submission of Contributions to IEEE 802 Working Groups">
					<t>IEEE 802 Working Groups are open to contribution. In many cases, a WG or subgroup will issue a 
						call for contributions with a specific technical solicitation, including deadlines and submission instructions. 
						Some groups maintain specific submission procedures and specify a contribution cover sheet to clarify the 
						status of the contribution.</t>
				</section>

	        		<section title="Access to IEEE 802 Working Group Drafts">
					<t>The IEEE owns the copyright to draft standards developed within IEEE standardization projects. 
						As a result, such drafts are never made publicly available. The IEEE-SA grants permission for an IEEE 
						draft standard to be distributed without charge to the participants for that IEEE standards development project.
						Typically, such distribution is on the Internet under password protection, with the password provided to the 
						members of the participating WG. Requests to the relevent WG chair for access to a draft for purposes of 
						participation in the project are typically granted. In some cases, under an organizational agreement, 
						the IEEE-SA allows for ready document exchange with other entities. No such agreement currently exists to 
						cover exchanges between IEEE-SA and IETF.</t>
				</section>

	        		<section title="Access to IEEE 802 Standards">
					<t>IEEE standards, once approved, are published and made available for sale. 
						They can be purchased from 
						<eref target="http://www.techstreet.com/ieeegate.html"> the IEEE Standards Store: </eref>. 
						They are also available from other outlets, including <eref target="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org">
						the IEEE Xplore digital library: </eref> . The <eref target="http://standards.ieee.org/about/get"> 
						Get IEEE 802 program: </eref> grants public access to download individual IEEE 802 standards at no charge. 
						IEEE 802 standards are added to the Get IEEE 802 program six months after publication.</t>
				</section>
			</section>

        		<section title="Access to IETF Documents">
				<t>Internet-Drafts are available on the IETF web site.  IEEE 802 can
					make selected IEEE 802 documents at any stage of development available
					to the IETF by attaching them to a formal liaison statement.
   					Although a communication can point to a URL where a non-ASCII
   					document (e.g., Word) can be downloaded, attachments in proprietary
   					formats to an IETF mailing list are discouraged.  It should also be
   					recognized that the official versions of all IETF documents are in ASCII.</t>

        	<section title="Participation in Document Review and Approval">

        		<t>During the course of IEEE 802 and IETF collaboration, 
				it is important for technical experts to review documents of mutual interest and, when appropriate, 
				to provide review comments to the approving body as the document moves through the approval process.</t>

				<t><list style="numbers">
					<t>When a working group is considering adoption of an individual draft. Adoption is often signaled

						group's mailing list.</t>
					<t>When the Internet Engineering Steering Group issues an "IETF Last Call" ("Last Call") for a draft.
						This is similar in spirit to WGLC, but is a request for review and approval that is addressed

        	<section title="Expert Review Processes">


        		<t>With the areas of cooperation between IEEE 802 and IETF increasing,
   				the document review process has extended beyond the traditional
   				subjects of SNMP MIBs and AAA.  For example, as part of the IETF
   				CAPWAP WG charter, IEEE 802.11 was asked to review the CAPWAP
   				Taxonomy Document [RFC4118]; Dorothy Stanley organized an ad hoc
   				group for this purpose.  IEEE 802.11 has also reviewed [IDSEL] and
   				[IABLINK].  Within IETF, IEEE 802 comments are resolved using normal
   				WG and IETF processes.</t>

   			<t>IETF participants can comment as part of the IEEE 802 ballot process,
   				regardless of their voting status within IEEE 802.  Comments must be
   				composed in the format specified for the ballot, and submitted by the
  				ballot deadline.</t>

        		<t>Both IEEE 802 and IETF work best when people participate directly in work of mutual interest, but that's not always possible,
				and individuals speaking as individuals may not provide effective communication between the two SDOs. 
				From time to time, it may be appropriate for a technical body in one SDO to communicate as a body with a technical body
				in the other SDO. This section describes the mechanisms used to provide formal communication between the two organizations, 
				should that become necessary.</t>

        	<t>EDITOR NOTE: This section is hacked out of RFC 6756, so needs IEEE-side attention.</t>

		<t>All IETF working groups and all ITU-T study group Questions have
   			associated mailing lists.</t>

		<t>In the IETF, the mailing list is the primary vehicle for discussion
   			and decision-making.  It is recommended that the ITU-T experts
   			interested in particular IETF working group topics subscribe to and
   			participate in these lists.  IETF WG mailing lists are open to all
   			subscribers.  The IETF working group mailing list subscription and
   			archive information are noted in each working group's charter.  In
   			the ITU-T, the TSB has set up formal mailing lists for Questions,
   			working parties, and other topics within study groups (more detail
   			can be found on the ITU-T web site).  These mailing lists are
   			typically used for ITU-T correspondence, including technical
   			discussion, meeting logistics, reports, etc.</t>

		<t>EDITOR NOTE: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6756#section-2.6 is primarily from the ITU-T side;

			each organization registers protocol parameters.</t>



        	<section title="IANA">

        		<t>The IETF uses the Internet Assigned Numbering Authority (IANA) as a registry for protocol parameter allocation. The overarching
				document describing this is RFC 5226. RFC 5342 discusses use of IEEE 802-specific IANA parameters in
   				IETF protocols and specifies IANA considerations for allocation of
   				code points under the IANA OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier).</t>

			<t>EtherType Allocation - 
   				The EtherType field is very limited, so that allocations are made
   				solely on an "as needed" basis.  For related uses, a single EtherType
   				should be requested, with additional fields serving as sub-protocol
   				identifiers, rather than applying for multiple EtherTypes.  EtherType
   				allocation policy is described in [TYPE-TUT].</t>

			<t>While a fee is normally charged by IEEE 802 for the allocation of an
  				 EtherType, IEEE 802 will consider waiving the fee for allocations
   				relating to an IETF standards track document, based on a request from
  			 the IESG.</t>

		<section title="MIB Review">
			<t>Historically the MIB modules for IEEE 802.1 and IEEE 802.3 were developped in the IETF Bridge MIB and Hub MIB Working Groups 
				respectively. With travel budgets under pressure, it has become increasingly difficult for companies to fund employees 
				to attend both IEEE 802 and IETF meetings.  As a result, an alternative was found to past arrangements that involved chartering 
				MIB work items within an IETF WG by transferring the work to IEEE 802 with expert support for MIB review from the IETF.  In order
				to encourage wider review of MIBs developed by IEEE 802 WGs, it is recommended that MIB modules developed in IEEE 802 follow the
				MIB guidelines [RFC4181].  An IEEE 802 group may request assignment of a 'MIB Doctor' to assist in a MIB review by contacting the
				IETF Operations and Management Area Director.</t>

			<t>By standardizing IEEE 802 MIBs only within IEEE 802 while utilizing the SNMP quality control process, the IETF and IEEE 802 seek to 
				ensure quality while decreasing overhead. The process of transfer of the MIB work from the IETF to IEEE 802 is documented in 
				[RFC4663] and in [I-D ETHERNET-MIB-TRANSFER].</t>
