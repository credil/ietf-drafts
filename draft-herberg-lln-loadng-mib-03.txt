   Definition of Managed Objects for the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc
      Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next Generation (LOADng)
                    draft-herberg-lln-loadng-mib-03

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next
   Generation (LOADng) process on a router.  The MIB module defined in
   this memo, denoted LOADng-MIB, also reports state.  While LOADng is
   layer agnostic and can be run with different address families (e.g.,
   on L2 using MAC addreses, or on L3 using IP addresss), this MIB
   module assumes that LOADng is used on L3, and uses only IPv4/IPv6
   addresses.

Internet-Draft               The LOADng-MIB                    July 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes objects for configuring
   parameters of the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector
   Routing Protocol - Next Generation (LOADng) [LOADng] process on a
   router.  The MIB module defined in this document, denoted LOADng-MIB,
   also reports state.  While LOADng is layer agnostic and can be run
   with different address families (e.g., on L2 using MAC addreses, or
   on L3 using IP addresss), this MIB module assumes that LOADng is used
   on L3, and uses only IPv4/IPv6 addresses.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC
   2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol -
   Next Generation (LOADng) [LOADng] is a routing protocol, derived from
   AODV [RFC3561] and extended for use in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
   (MANETs).  As a reactive protocol, the basic operations of LOADng
   include generation of Route Requests (RREQs) by a router (originator)
   for when discovering a route to a destination, forwarding of such
   RREQs until they reach the destination router, generation of Route
   Replies (RREPs) upon receipt of an RREQ by the indicated destination,
   and unicast hop-by-hop forwarding of these RREPs towards the
   originator.  If a route is detected broken, i.e., if forwarding of a
   data packet to the recorded next hop on the route to the destination

Internet-Draft               The LOADng-MIB                    July 2013


   is detected to fail, a Route Error (RERR) message is returned in
   unicast to the originator of that data packet.

   This MIB module describes objects for configuring parameters of a
   LOADng process on a router, as well as for the relevant state of a
   LOADng process on a router, in order to monitor and manage parameters
   and information bases of LOADng.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB module.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the LOADng protocol process in the
      router.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the LOADng-MIB module.  The
   MIB module is arranged into the following structure:

   o  LOADngObjects - defining objects within this MIB module.  The
      objects are arranged into the following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the LOADng instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the LOADng instance running on the router.

   o  LOADngConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB module.

5.1.  The Configuration Group

   The LOADng router is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the LOADng-MIB
   module are found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt
   was made in developing the LOADng-MIB module to support all
   configuration objects defined in [LOADng].  For all of the
   configuration parameters, the same default values of these parameters
   as defined in [LOADng] are followed.

Internet-Draft               The LOADng-MIB                    July 2013


5.2.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   [LOADng].  The LOADng-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain
   the complete set of state information defined within the information
   bases specified in Section 6 of [LOADng].

5.3.  Tables and Indexing

   The LOADng-MIB module contains a number of tables which record data
   related to:

   o  the local LOADng router,

   o  a local LOADng interface on the LOADng router,

   o  other LOADng routers in the routing domain.

   The LOADng-MIB module's tables and their indexing are:

   o  loadngInterfaceTable - describes the configuration of the
      interfaces of this LOADng router.  This table is indexed by
      loadngIfIndex.

   o  loadngLibLocalIfSetTable - records all network addresses which are
      defined as local interface network addresses on this LOADng
      router.  This table is indexed by loadngLibLocalIfSetIfAddrIndex,
      loadngLibLocalIfSetIfIndex.

   o  loadngLibDestAddressSetTable - records addresses, for which a
      LOADng Router will generate RREPs in response to received RREQs,
      in addition to its own interface addresses (as listed in the Local
      Interface Set).  This table is indexed by
      loadngLibDestAddressSetIndex.

   o  loadngBlacklistedNeighborSetTable - records the neighbor interface
      addresses of a LOADng Router, with which connectivity has been
      detected to be unidirectional.  This table is indexed by
      loadngBlacklistedNeighborSetIndex.

   o  loadngRoutingSetTable - records the next hop on the route to each
      known destination.  This table is indexed by
      loadngRoutingSetIndex.

   o  loadngPendingAckSetTable - records information about RREPs which
      have been transmitted with the ackrequired flag set, and for which
      an RREP_ACK has not yet been received.  This table is indexed by
      loadngPendingAckSetIndex .

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB module contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  MIB modules and specific definitions
   imported from MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction
   with the MIB module contained within this document are identified in
   this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The System group in the SNMPv2-MIB module [RFC3418] is defined as
   being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity
   as a whole.  The System group provides identification of the
   management entity and certain other system-wide data.  The LOADng-MIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The following LOADng-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], and INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].

       DESCRIPTION
          "loadngInterfaceTable describes the
           configuration of the interfaces of this router
           that are intended to use MANET control protocols.
           As such, this table 'sparse augments' the ifTable
           specifically when LOADng is to be configured to
           operate over this interface.  The interface is
           identified by the ifIndex from the interfaces
           group defined in the Interfaces Group MIB module.

           A conceptual row in this table exists if and only
           if either a manager has explicitly created the row
           or there is an interface on the managed device
           that supports and runs LOADng.

           The manager can create a row by setting
           rowStatus to 'createAndGo' or 'createAndWait'.
           Row objects having associated DEFVAL clauses are
           automatically defined by the agent with these
           values during row creation, unless the manager
           explicitly defines these object values during the
           row creation.

           If the corresponding entry with ifIndex value
           is deleted from the Interface Table, then the entry
           in this table is automatically deleted,
           LOADng is disabled on this interface,
           and all configuration and state information
           related to this interface is to be removed
           from memory."

       MAX-ACCESS  read-only
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
          "loadngRoutingSetSeqnum is the value of the
           <seq-num> field of the RREQ or RREP which installed
           or last updated this tuple. For the routing
           tuples installed by previous hop information of
           RREQ or RREP, loadngRoutingSetSeqnum must be
           set to -1.

           Sequence numbers are used in LOADng
           for the purpose of discarding 'old' information,
           i.e., messages received out of order.  However
           with a limited number of bits for representing
           sequence numbers, wrap-around (that the sequence
           number is incremented from the maximum possible
           value to zero) will occur.  To prevent this from
           interfering with the operation of this protocol,
           LOADng implementations observe the following when
           determining the ordering of sequence numbers.

           In LOADng, MAXVALUE designates one more than the
           largest possible value for a sequence number.
           For a 16 bit sequence number MAXVALUE is 65536.

           The sequence number S1 is said to be 'greater than'
           the sequence number S2 if:

              o  S1 > S2 AND S1 - S2 < MAXVALUE/2 OR

              o  S2 > S1 AND S2 - S1 > MAXVALUE/2

           When sequence numbers S1 and S2 differ by MAXVALUE/2
           their ordering cannot be determined.  In this case,
           which should not occur, either ordering may be
           assumed.

           Thus when comparing two messages, it is possible
           - even in the presence of wrap-around - to determine
           which message contains the most recent information."

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects for the configuration and monitoring
   of LOADng [LOADng].

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  loadngNetTraversalTime - this writable object controls the maximum
      time that a packet is expected to take when traversing from one
      end of the network to the other.  If set too low, a router will
      not wait long enough until receiving an RREP as response to an
      RREQ.  Therefore, all route requests may fail and render LOADng
      useless.

Internet-Draft               The LOADng-MIB                    July 2013


   o  loadngRREQRetries - this writable object controls how many RREQs
      may be sent until an RREP must have been receveived or the route
      discovery is considered failed.  If set too low in very lossy
      networks, route discovery may fail for destinations (which
      otherwise would have succeeded, had the value been higher).  If
      set too high, a router may send unnecessary many RREQs, draining
      energy from the router and consuming bandwidth.

   o  loadngRREQMinInterval- this writable object controls the minimum
      interval between two successive RREQs.  If set too low, a malicous
      node (host or router) may request routes for many destinations,
      resulting in many RREQs, which drain energy from the router and
      consume bandwidth.

   o  loadngRHoldTime - this writable object controls how long a Routing
      Tuple is hold in the Routing Set. If set too low, a router may not
      keep routes long enough, and may therefore frequently rediscover
      the same routes to a destination, resulting in bandwidth
      consumption and energy drain.

   o  loadngRREPAckTimeout - this writable object controls how long a
      router waits before expecting an RREP_ACK.  If set too low, and if
      RREP_ACKs are required, the router may list the neighbor as
      unidirectional and may therefore not use it for routing.

   o  loadngBHoldTime - this writable object controls how long a
      Blacklisted Neighbor Tuples is hold in the Blacklisted Neighbor
      Set. If set too high, a neighbor router may be blocked for a long
      time, even though it may have become reachable bidirectionally in
      the meantime.

   o  loadngRREPAckRequired - this writable object controls whether
      RREP_ACKs are required for verification of bidirectionality.  If
      disabled in a lossy environment, and if bidirectionality is not
      verified by other means, unidirectional routes may be discovered
      to destinations.

   o  loadngMaxDist - this writable object controls the maximum distance
      of a router in the routing domain.  If set too low, destinations
      may be ignored to which otherwise a path could be established by
      LOADng.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their

   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  loadngRoutingSetTable - The table contains information on
      destinations in the routing domain, specifically their IP address
      in the loadngRoutingSetDestIpAddr object.  This information
      provides an adversary broad information on the members of the
      routing domain, located within this single table.  This
      information can be use to expedite attacks on the other members of
      the routing domain without having to go through a laborious
      discovery process on their own.  This object is the index into the
      table, and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-accessible'.  However, this
      information can be exposed using SNMP operations.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------
         LOADng-MIB          { mib-2 XXXX }
         IANA EDITOR NOTE: please assign XXXX
