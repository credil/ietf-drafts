                     Multicast Traceroute for MVPNs
               draft-kebler-kurapati-l3vpn-mvpn-mtrace-00

Abstract

   Mtrace is a tool used to troubleshoot issues in a network deploying
   Multicast service.  When multicast is used within a VPN service
   offering, the base Mtrace specification does not detect the failures.
   This document specifies a method of using multicast traceroute in a
   network offering Multicast in VPN service.

1.  Introduction

   The current multicast traceroute [I-D.ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2] travels
   up the tree hop-by-hop towards the source.  This verifies the basic
   multicast state back to the source, but is not sufficient to verify
   the MVPN state.  The base Mtrace specification assumes that the
   routers in the path are directly connected through interfaces.  In
   the case of Multicast traffic over VPN service, the PEs who are MVPN
   neighbors may be separated by several router hops.  The path taken by
   the query can be completely different from the path taken through
   core by the actual multicast traffic.  Consider a case in the below
   figure, where provider tunnel between PE2 (Source) and PE1 (Receiver)
   is not established correctly due to incorrect MVPN state on PE2.  In
   the current form of Mtrace, the Query would result in a successful
   response since there is no error detection mechanism for MVPN state
   available currently.  Even if one can infer from the statistics of
   the Mtrace Response that PE2 has an issue, the existing error codes
   are not sufficient to identify the root cause.  Also, there could be
   a problem sending traffic over the provider tunnel from PE2 to PE1,

   but the mtrace query will not even travel over this provider tunnel.
   Therefore, the mtrace successful response can be misleading.  This
   draft ensures that the Response uses same provider-tunnel that the
   given C-S,C-G data would traverse and returns appropriate MVPN
   specific error codes which would help in identifying the root cause.

                               MVPN topology

2.  Overview

   As described in the Mtracev2 specification
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2], a Querier initiates an Mtrace Query
   which is sent to the Last Hop Router.  Last Hop Router converts this
   into a Request and sends it towards the First Hop Router.  This draft
   introduces a new "Downstream Request" mechanism to allow the First
   Hop Router to send the mtrace request message back on the Provider
   tunnel to the Last hop router.  The last hop router will then change
   it to Response and send it to the Querier who initiated the Query.
   If there is any error encountered by the Last hop router or First Hop
   router, a Response is directly unicasted to the querier with
   appropriate MVPN specific error codes added.  Each hop in the path of
   Mtrace decrements the TTL value before sending the mtrace message.

   Since the Mtrace is being extended for MVPNs, the Last Hop router and
   First Hop router SHOULD be a Provider Edge (PE) router so that the
   MVPN specific error codes can be contained within the provider space.
   The Request will be initiated by the egress PE and will travel
   upstream to the ingress PE.  It is assumed that the Querier knows and
   can reach the egress PE.  A Querier and egress PE can be the same
   router.

Internet-Draft                 MVPN Mtrace                     July 2013


   For Mtrace initiated by the CEs, the specification mentioned in
   Mtracev2 [I-D.ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2] SHOULD be followed.  If a Mtrace
   message is received by the PE on CE facing interfaces containing MVPN
   specific extensions defined in this draft, it SHOULD be discarded.

3.  Protocol Details

   The protocol details that follow are described in terms of mtracev2.
   However, the same procedures can be achieved with mtracev1.  The
   protocol extensions needed for mtracev2 are described in Section 5
   and the protocol extensions for mtracev1 and described in section 6.

3.1.  Mtrace Query

   A Querier willing to perform a Mtrace on a MVPN issues a Mtrace
   Query.  The format of the Query TLV is as specified in the Mtracev2
   specification [I-D.ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2].  The (C-S,C-G) to be
   queried is populated in the source address and group address fields
   of the Mtrace2 Query block.  A deployment may use wild card SPMSIs as
   defined in [RFC6625].  For example, a (C-*,C-*) wild card SPMSI or a
   (C-*,ALL-PIM-ROUTERS) can be used to send messages like BSR across
   PEs as mentioned in section 5.3.4 MVPN specification [RFC6513].  A
   querier may be interested in knowing the health of such a SPMSI
   tunnel.  In this case, the Multicast Address and Source Address
   fields of the Mtrace2 query can be filled with wild cards (all 1s)
   accordingly by the querier.

   The Querier MUST add a MVPN Extended Query Block to include the RD of
   the C-S,C-G that it wishes to trace.  When wild card SPMSIs are used,
   a PE could have subscribed to multiple upstream PEs for wild card
   SPMSIs.  Hence, a query for a wild card SPMSI MUST also specify the
   upstream PE address that it is interested to query.  The upstream PE
   address in the MVPN Extended Query Block MUST be filled only for wild
   card queries.  For a regular (C-S,C-G) query, this field SHOULD be
   set to 0s by the querier and is ignored by the receivers.

   This Query is sent to the Downstream PE (Last Hop Router)to initiate
   the mtrace towards the source.  If a Querier does not receive a
   Response, it can retry sending Query messages with increasing TTL
   values to help diagnose where the Mtrace messages are being lost.

3.2.  Mtrace Request

   The PE that receives the query will lookup the (C-S,C-G) using the RD
   of the query to distinguish the vrf.  If the RD doesnt match any VRF,
   PE sends a response with error code set to BAD_RD.  The PE first
   checks the C-Mcast route that is matching (C-S,C-G) of the mtrace
   Query.  It then finds the upstream multicast hop from the selected



Kebler & Kurapati       Expires January 14, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 MVPN Mtrace                     July 2013


   C-Mcast route and unicasts the requests to the upstream multicast hop
   after decrementing the TTL.  The Mtrace Request MUST have PMSI Tunnel
   Attributes Augmented Response Block populated with the PMSI attribute
   that the PE uses to receive the traffic for the given (C-S,C-G)
   traffic.

   Upstream multicast hop can be same as upstream PE router in some
   cases, while it can be the ASBR or the BGP nexthop of the selected
   C-Mcast route in Inter-AS scenarios.  The procedures for finding
   upstream multicast hop is discussed in detail under section 5.1 of
   MVPN specification [RFC6513].

   When a wild card query is received, the PE will look for the upstream
   PE address in the MVPN Extended query block.  The PE will then check
   if it has bound to the wild card SPMSI tunnel from the specified
   upstream PE.  If it has, it will populate the Leaf A-D Augmented
   Response Block and PMSI Tunnel Attributes Augmented Response Block
   with the respective values.  If the PE has not received any wild card
   SPMSI AD route from the specified upstream PE in the query, it should
   send a response with the error code set to
   NO_WILD_CARD_SPMSI_AD_RCVD.  If the PE has received wild card SPMSI
   AD route from the upstream PE, but has not responded with a LEAF-AD
   route, it should send a response with the error code set to
   NO_WILD_CARD_SPMSI_LEAF_AD_SENT.

   For a non-wild-card query, the upstream PE address field in the MVPN
   Extended query block MUST be ignored by the PEs.  It MUST follow the
   procedure to find the upstream multicast hop as discussed earlier.

   If the route does not match any MVPN-TIB state, then the PE should
   send a Response to the Querier with the error code set to
   NO_CMCAST_STATE.  If the PE cannot locate the upstream PE then it
   should send a response to the Querier with the NO_UPSTREAM_PE error
   code.

   From the selected UMH route, the local PE extracts the ASN of the
   upstream PE (as carried in the Source AS Extended Community of the
   route), and the source-AS field of the mtrace Query is set to that
   AS.

   If the local and the upstream PEs are in the same AS, then the RD in
   the mtrace Query is set to the RD of the VPN-IP route for the source/
   RP.

   Section 8 of MVPN specification [RFC6513] mentions two procedures
   (Segmented and Non-Segmented) for handling Inter-AS scenarios.  If
   the local and the upstream PEs are in different ASes, and if
   segmented Inter-AS procedure is used, then the local PE finds in its

Internet-Draft                 MVPN Mtrace                     July 2013


   VRF an Inter-AS I-PMSI A-D route whose Source AS field carries the
   ASN of the upstream PE.  The RD of the found Inter-AS I-PMSI A-D
   route is used as the RD of the mtrace Query.  If Inter-AS I-PMSI A-D
   route is not found, a response with error code UNKNOWN_INTER_AS is
   sent.

   To support non-segmented inter-AS tunnels, if the local and the
   upstream PEs are in different ASes, the local system finds in its VRF
   an Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route from the upstream PE.  The Originating
   Router's IP Address field of that route has the same value as the one
   carried in the VRF Route Import of the unicast route to the address
   carried in the Multicast Source field.  The RD of the found Intra-AS
   I-PMSI A-D route is used as the RD in the mtrace Query.  The Source
   AS field in the mtrace Query is set to value of the Originating
   Router's IP Address field of the found Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route.

   The PE receiving Mtrace Query will check for any errors.  If any
   error is detected it will send the error back to the Querier.
   Otherwise, it will change the TLV value to be an Mtrace Request, and
   it will add a Mtrace2 Standard Response Block.  It will also add a
   PMSI Tunnel Attributes Augmented Response Block with the attributes
   of the PMSI used to receive traffic for the S,G.  If a Leaf-AD route
   was advertised to the upstream PE for this S,G then the PE will also
   include a Leaf-AD Augmented Response Block with the NLRI of the
   associated Leaf-AD route.

3.2.1.  Ingress PE Procedures

   The PE that receives the Request, will check the PMSI attributes of
   the sender of request to see if they match the values used to send
   traffic for the S,G. If the values do not match, then the PE uses the
   appropriate pmsi error code as specified in 'MVPN Error Codes'
   section and sends a mtrace Response back to the Querier.  Also, if a
   Leaf A-D Augmented Response Block is included, the PE will validate
   that it has received this Leaf A-D route from the router that sent
   the Request.  If not, then this PE should change the error code to
   BAD_LEAF_AD and send the Response to the Querier.  If the PE expects
   that a Leaf A-D route is needed for the downstream PE to receive
   traffic, but did not receive one in the mtrace Request from the
   sending router, then it should use a NO_LEAF_AD_RCVD error code for
   the mtrace Response.  For a wild card SPMSI query, if the PE didn't
   receive LEAF AD route from the downstream PE, it should use
   NO_LEAD_AD_RCVD error code.

   When the upstream PE receives the Request, it will check for any
   errors.  If there are errors detected, or if the TTL expired, then
   the PE will change the TLV code to be a Mtrace Response and unicast
   the response back to the Querier.

Internet-Draft                 MVPN Mtrace                     July 2013


   The ingress PE will also check it has local vrf connectivity for the
   source/RP.  If it does not have any connectivity to the source/RP
   then it should use the base specification error code NO_ROUTE and
   send an mtrace Response.  Note that in a Virtual Hub and Spoke
   environment, it is possible for a PE to receive a mtrace Request and
   need to propagate it to another upstream PE.  These procedures are
   outlined in the section "Virtual Hub and Spoke".  If the PE does not
   expect to be receiving mtrace Responses from the mvpn core and have
   the route to the source located via another upstream PE, then it can
   use the base specification RPF_IF error code.

   If the PE that receives the Request is the ingress PE that has local
   vrf connectivity for the source, then it will add a Standard Response
   Block to the mtrace message.  It will not include the additional PMSI
   Attributes Response Block.  Then it will turn the Request into a
   Downstream Request by changing the value of the Type field of the
   TLV.  It will send the mtrace message on the provider tunnel used to
   send the S,G data traffic.

3.3.  Downstream Requests

   When a router receives Mtrace Downstream Request, it will determine
   if it has added any of the Response Blocks for this mtrace message.
   If it does not locate its address in the list of Response Blocks,
   then it will silently discard this mtrace message.  Otherwise, it
   will set the 'D' bit in its PMSI Tunnel Attributes Augmented Response
   Block to indicate that this message has been received on the PMSI
   tunnel.

   If this router is the egress PE that provided the initial Response
   Block, then it will change the mtrace type to a Reply and sends the
   Reply to the Querier (the egress PE and the Querier may be the same
   router).  Otherwise, this router must send the Downstream PE on the
   PMSI that it would normally send traffic for the S,G.  Before sending
   the Downstream Request, the router must decrement the TTL and check
   for TTL expiry.  If the TTL has expired, then this router must send
   the Response to the Querier with the appropriate code.

3.4.  ASBR Behavior

   When an ASBR receives a mtrace Request the ASBR finds an Inter-AS
   I-PMSI A-D route whose RD and Source AS matches the RD and Source AS
   carried in the mtrace Query.  If no matching route is found and the
   ASBR is using segmented tunnels as described in MVPN specification
   [RFC6513], the ASBR sends an UNKNOWN_INTER_AS error code back to the
   Querier.  If a matching route is found, the ASBR acts as a "first hop
   router" and modifies the Query type to DOWNSTREAM_REQUEST.  ASBR in
   this case MUST validate the PMSI attributes similar to the "first hop



Kebler & Kurapati       Expires January 14, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 MVPN Mtrace                     July 2013


   router" and respond if there is any errors.  ASBR MUST populate PMSI
   Tunnel Attributes Augmented Response Block with the Inter-AS provider
   tunnel information before sending the DOWNSTREAM_REQUEST.  Note that
   the mtrace request does not proceed upstream as it is assumed that
   performing a traceroute and exposing IP addresses across AS
   boundaries would not be desirable with Segmented Inter-AS Provider
   Tunnels.

   To support non-segmented inter-AS tunnels as described in [RFC6513],
   instead of matching the RD and Source AS carried in the mtrace Query
   against the RD and Source AS of an Inter-AS I-PMSI A-D route, the
   ASBR should match it against the RD and the Originating Router's IP
   Address of the Intra- AS I-PMSI A-D routes.  The Next Hop field of
   the MP_REACH_NLRI of the found Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route is used as
   the destination for the mtrace Request.

3.5.  Virtual Hub and Spoke

   When a Virtual-Hub (V-HUB) as described in specification
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-virtual-hub] receives a mtrace Request the S,G may be
   reachable via one of its vrf interfaces.  In this case, the V-HUB is
   an ingress PE and the procedure are defined in the Section "Ingress
   PE Procedures".  Otherwise, the C-RP/C-S of the route is reachable
   via some other PE.  This is the case where the received route was
   originated by a Virtual-spoke (V-spoke) that sees the V-HUB as the
   "upstream PE" for the given source, but the V-HUB sees another PE as
   the "upstream PE" for that source.  In this case, the V-HUB should
   check the PMSI attributes sent in the mtrace Request against the
   Tunnel Attributes of the Provider Tunnel used to send traffic for the
   S,G from the upstream PE to the V-Spoke.

   The V-HUB sends a mtrace Request to its upstream PE the same way as
   it would if it received a mtrace Query.  V-HUB MUST add PMSI Tunnel
   Attributes Augmented Response Block of its own before sending the
   mtrace Request to the upstream PE.  It may also add Leaf-AD Augmented
   Response Block if a Leaf-AD route was advertised upstream by the
   V-HUB.  If the RD or Source-AS of the upstream PE is different, the
   V-HUB updates the MVPN Extended Query Block accordingly.

3.6.  Inter-Area Provider Tunnels

3.6.1.  Egress PE

   The egress PE does the same procedures as specified in
   Section "Mtrace Request" except it sends the Request upstream to the
   IP address determined from the Global Administrator field of the
   Inter-area P2MP Segmented Next-hop Extended Community as described in
   specification [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mcast] . If the egress PE has

   sent a Leaf-AD route then it must send a Leaf-AD Augmented Response
   Block with the NLRI of the Leaf A-D route.

3.6.2.  ABR Behavior

   ABR MUST find a S-PMSI or I-PMSI route whose NLRI has the same value
   as the Route Key field of the received mtrace Leaf-AD extended Query
   Block.  If such a matching route is not found then a Response should
   be sent to the Querier with the NO_LEAF_AD_RCVD.  If the ABR has sent
   a Leaf-AD route then it must add a Leaf-AD Augmented Response Block
   with the values of Leaf A-D route NLRI.  The upstream node's IP
   address is the IP address determined from the Global Administrator
   field of the Inter-area P2MP Segmented Next-hop Extended Community.

3.7.  Mtrace MVPN Procedure

   In this section, we will briefly discuss the Mtrace procedure taking
   a working and non-working network topology.

   The above figure depicts the path of MTRACE in working condition.
   MTRACE request for MVPN can traverse multiple hops when a Virtual HUB
   is present or when segmented P2MP inter-area tunnels are used.  If no
   error conditions are detected the downstream request will travel the
   same path as the regular multicast packet for the queried mroute
   would flow.  The last hop router/egress router will convert it into a
   Response and send it back to querier

   Let us consider a non-working case where Mtrace is expected to be
   used.  Taking Virtual-HUB as an example, assume that there is a data-
   path issue between V-HUB and Egress Spoke.  The below steps take
   place to determine the issue between V-HUB and egress Spoke

      1 - Querier sends the Mtrace Query towards LHR (Egress PE-Spoke).

      2 - Egress PE sends Request to V-HUB.  V-HUB realises that the
      first hop router is a connected spoke and sends the request to
      Ingress Spoke PE.

      3 - Ingress Spoke PE sends Downstream Request to V-HUB.  The same
      is received by V-HUB.  V-HUB sets the 'D' bit in its PMSI Tunnel
      Attributes Augmented Response Block.

      4 - V-HUB sends Downstream request to ingress spoke.  This is
      never received by the ingress spoke.

      5 - The result of first 4 steps is that querier did not receive
      the response.  This makes the querier fall back to TTL method.

      6 - Querier reduces the TTL and the result will show that the hop
      from V-HUB to ingress spoke is missing thereby pointing the issue
      at the right place.

4.  Error Detection

   All routers will check for normal multicast errors as defined in the
   Mtracev2 specification.  In addition, they will check for errors
   specific to MVPNs and this specification.

   All receiving routers will check the state of the Provider Tunnel
   used for forwarding traffic for the given S,G.  The ability and
   manner to check if the Provider Tunnel is down depends on the
   Provider Tunnel type.  If the Provider Tunnel is known to be down the
   PE will respond with a PTUNNEL_DOWN error.

   In some situations the router needs to send a Leaf AD route to the
   upstream PE.  If the upstream expects a Leaf AD route, but did not
   receive one from the downstream PE, then the NO_LEAF_AD_RCVD error
   will be sent.

   The receiving router will check the values of the PMSI Tunnel
   attributes to see if they match the expected values for the PMSI.  If
   an Inclusive-PMSI is used, then the router will verify that the
   values match those in the I-PMSI A-D route.  If a Selective PMSI is
   used, then the Tunnel Attributes will be matched against the S-PMSI
   or Leaf A-D Route, depending on the Tunnel Type.  If the values do
   not match, then a error code of the corresponding PMSI mismatch will
   be sent.

   If a router receives a MVPN traceroute, but does not have the proper
   MVPN configuration, then it will respond with a UNEXPECTED_MVPN error

Internet-Draft                 MVPN Mtrace                     July 2013


   The PEs in the MVPN Mtrace add the Standard Response Block as defined
   in Mtrace2 [I-D.ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2].  For a PE, the incoming or
   outgoing interface can be a Tunnel.  The First Hop Router (FHR) PE
   which is connected to the source SHOULD populate the incoming
   interface address with the respective interface connected to the CE.
   The outgoing interface address MAY be populated with 0 in this case.
   Other routers in the mtrace path MAY populate incoming and outgoing
   interface address fields as 0.  'Multicast Rtg Protocol' field MUST
   be populated with 0s by the Last Hop Router (LHR).  First Hop Router
   (FHR) can populate this field with respective multicast routing
   protocol used towards its upstream CE.  All the remaining fields of
   the Standard Response Block are populated as defined by the Mtrace2
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2] specification.

7.  IANA Considerations

   New TLV Type for MTRACE_MVPN_QUERY, MTRACE_MVPN_REQUEST,
   MTRACE_MVPN_DOWNSTREAM_REQUEST, MTRACE_MVPN_RESPONSE

8.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this design other than what
   is already in the mtracev2 specification.
