            <t> The WebSocket protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol"/> provides a subprotocol extension
                facility. The MessageBroker WebSocket Subprotocol (MBWS) is a WebSocket Subprotocol
                used by messaging clients to send messages to, and receive messages from an internet
                message broker (herein called a message broker). A message broker is a messaging
                intermediary that queues messages sent by its clients for asynchronous delivery to
                its clients. </t>
            <t> Messages are addressed to message-broker-specific address names. Clients send
                messages to addresses and consume messages from addresses. Clients do not send
                messages directly to other clients. </t>
            <t> Message brokers provide a range of functionality that is outside the scope of MBWS.
                Typically an internet message broker provides a REST API for working with this
                functionality; such as configuring client credentials; setting client access
                controls; configuring address routing; etc. </t>
            <t> MBWS limits its scope to the definition of a WebSocket subprotocol that provides a
                full duplex, reliable message transport protocol between message brokers and their
                clients; and, between message brokers. </t>
            <t> Since reliable message transport is often independent of a broker's particular
                features, MBWS can be used as the message transport protocol for a wide range of
                message brokers. </t>
            <t> The MBWS subprotocol defines a binary message frame and a text message frame. Both types of frame 
                carry the same protocol; however, the protocol bindings differ slightly. The binary frame is
                a WebSocket binary message that contains an MBWS binary header followed by a binary message body. The text frame
                is a WebSocket UTF-8 text message that contains an MBWS text header followed by a text message body.</t>

            <t> The WebSocket protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol"/> provides a subprotocol extension

                Typically an internet message broker provides a REST API for working with this

            <t> The MBWS subprotocol defines a binary message frame and a text message frame. Both types of frame

                a WebSocket binary message that contains an MBWS binary header followed by a binary message body. The text frame
                is a WebSocket UTF-8 text message that contains an MBWS text header followed by a text message body.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="MBWS Functionality">
            <t> MBWS subprotocol defines two capabilities: 
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Connection Recovery - the ability to support a logical, reliable connection
                        that spans a sequence of WebSocket sessions (herein, such a connection is
                        called a 'connection')</t>
                    <t>Message Metadata - the ability to annotate a WebSocket message with metadata
                        to support the functionality of a message broker</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t> This document defines two subprotocols - MessageBroker WebSocket Subprotocol (MBWS)
                and MessageBrokerLight WebSocket Subprotocol (MBLWS). MBWS supports both Connection
                Recovery and Message Metadata. MBLWS supports only Message Metadata. </t>
            <t> The protocol description defines the logical MBWS and MBLWS subprotocols. 
                The protocol ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/> defines
                the binding of these protocols to MBWS binary frames and text frames. MBLWS uses the
                same frames as MBWS. </t>
            <section title="Connection Recovery" toc="include">
                <t> When a WebSocket is normally closed, both client and server can assume the
                    messages they sent/delivered have been received by the other party. </t>
                <t> The reliability of the WebSocket's underlying TCP connection, combined with the
                    WebSocket close protocol, insures that both parties have implicitly acknowledged
                    the receipt of the all messages they have been sent. </t>
                <t> If a WebSocket session fails, the protocol does not define how the parties
                    resolve what messages have been received and what messages have been lost. In
                    many cases, this is not an issue; however, message brokers typically provide
                    once-and-only-once QoS and WebSocket alone is not sufficient to support this.</t>
                <t> MBWS defines a Connection Recovery subprotocol that allows a message broker client
                    whose connection's session has failed to create a new WebSocket session that extends 
                    the connection and reliably 
                    resynchronizes its full duplex message transport such that no messages are lost or
                    duplicated.</t>
                <section title="MBWS Connections"  toc="include">
                    <t> MBWS defines a connection that spans a sequence of one or more WebSocket sessions.
                        During the time period between the failure of one of its sessions and the
                        creation of its next session, its parties must maintain the state required
                        to recover the connection. Since messages may be lost when a session fails,
                        this state must contain a window of recently sent messages. MBWS provides
                        support for identifying connections; maintaining recently sent message
                        windows; recovering a connection on a new session; and, resynchronizing a
                        recovered connection's message transport. </t>
                </section>
                <section title="MBWS Connection Name and Connection Recovery" toc="include">
                    <t> When a client requests a new connection it sends a Connect frame with an
                        empty connection name. The server must respond with a Connect frame containing the
                        name of a new connection. The MBWS client must retain this connection name so that
                        it can be used later to recovery this connection if this connection's current WebSocket 
                        session were to fail. If a connection's WebSocket session is closed, as defined by the
                        WebSocket close protocol, it also closes the connection. It
                        is recommended but not required that connection name be a URN. </t>
                    <t> When a client requests the recovery of a connection, it sends a Connect
                        frame containing the name of the connection to be recovered. The message
                        broker must then respond with a Connect frame containing a connection name.
                        If this connection name matches the value sent by the client, the server has
                        accepted the recovery request. If the name does not match, the server has
                        rejected the recovery request and has opened a new connection. </t>
                    <t>Connection's are identified by a combination of client origin and connection
                        name. Only the client origin that opened the connection can recover the
                        connection.</t>
                </section>
                <section title="Message Synchronization of a Recovered MBWS Connection" toc="include">
                    <t> MBWS requires clients and message brokers to use an implicit sequence
                        numbering protocol for the messages transported by a connection. Each
                        direction of transport defines a separate sequence. The first message sent
                        by each party is sequence number 1, the next is 2, etc. Since both parties
                        are guaranteed to see the messages in the order sent, no explicit exchange
                        of sequence numbers is required. </t>
                    <t> Both parties must acknowledge receipt of messages they receive. This is done
                        by sending an Acknowledge frame with the sequence
                        number of the last message reliably received. When a sending party
                        receives an Acknowledge frame from its receiving party, the sending party
                        can delete from its message recovery window all messages with sequence
                        numbers less than or equal to the Acknowledge sequence number. </t>
                    <t> If a session abnormally terminates and a message broker accepts a client's
                        request to recover the connection, both client and message broker must
                        verify that they can resume sending messages with the message sequence
                        number required by each. Connection recovery message resynchronization is a 
                        serial two phase process. First, the client
                        provides the message broker with the information required for the broker to restart message
                        delivery. This phase is named broker-message-delivery-resync. Second, the
                        message broker provides the client with information required for the client to restart
                        message delivery. This phase is named client-message-delivery-resync. </t>
                    <t> If both broker-message-delivery-resync and client-message-delivery-resync
                        succeed, the connection has been recovered. If either fails, a new
                        connection is opened. </t>

                        <t> The client sends an Acknowledge frame containing the sequence number of
                            the last message it has received. The message broker validates it
                            can resume sending with the next message in sequence. </t>
                        <t> If so, the message broker must reply with a Connect frame containing the
                            connection name being recovered. Connection recovery then proceeds with

                    <section title="Address List" toc="include">
                        <t> For messages sent by a client to a broker, the Address List contains the list 
                            of destination Addresses to which to send the message. Empty Addresses are ignored. For messages 
                            delivered by a message broker to a
                            client, Address List contains the addresses from which the message originated. </t>

                        <t> The format and semantics of Address is message broker dependent and is
                            outside the scope of MBWS. For instance, some brokers may treat Address
                            as a strictly local name; other brokers may support a more global form
                            of addressing. Broker-specific message routing 
                            semantics determine

                            determined. This includes defining the meaning of an empty destination Address

                    MBWS connections avoid the overhead and latency of having to traverse web
                    proxies. </t>

                <t> In several places, the protocol refers to an 'empty' UTF-8 string element. In MBWS, 
                    UTF-8 string protocol elements are length-delimited. 
                    An 'empty' element is one with a zero valued

            <section title="Messaging Scope" toc="include">
                <t> Message brokers provide message-broker-specific functionality for routing,
                    queueing, forwarding, filtering, transporting, etc. messages. This results in
                    the broker delivering specific messages to specific clients. This document
                    defines how a message broker uses the subprotocols defined here to
                    transport messages to/from a client. All other message broker functionality is
                    outside the scope of this document.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Message Acknowledgement Interval">
                <t> The parties of an MBWS connection decide when to send Acknowledge frames.
                    Typically these are sent after some number of messages have been received or
                    some time interval has elapsed within which at least one message has been
                    received. The choice of acknowledgement interval is outside the scope of this
                    document. </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Synchronous Messaging" toc="include">
                <t> Message brokers have a history of supporting synchronous messaging where clients
                    make blocking calls to send and to receive messages. WebSocket and MBWS are
                    natively asynchronous messaging protocols. MBWS is optimized for asynchronous,
                    full duplex message transport. It has not been designed for synchronous
                    messaging. </t>
            </section>
            <section title="End-to-End Reliability" toc="include">
                <t> The responsibility for reliable message delivery over a MBWS connection is not
                    the responsibility of the message broker alone - it is only achieved when both
                    clients and brokers implement recovery of connections. The degree to which
                    clients and message brokers are able to recover from failure is outside the
                    scope of this document. </t>
