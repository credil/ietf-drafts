      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) defined in [RFC2131]
      provides configuration parameters to hosts on a TCP/IP based network.
      DHCP is built on a client-server model, where designated DHCP server
      allocate network addresses and deliver configuration parameters to
      dynamically configured hosts.</t>

      <!-- 
	<t>   
	   The changes to [RFC2131] defined in this draft facilitates DHCP relay
	   agents and hosts to process downstream DHCP messages
	   (DHCPOFFER,DHCPACK and DHCPNAK) when a DHCP client sets 
	   the 'chaddr' field as zero in DHCP request messages.	
	</t>
	-->

      <t>The changes to [RFC2131] defined in this document clarifies the use
      of 'client identifier' option by the DHCP servers. The clarification
      addresses the issues (as mentioned in Problem Statement) arising out
	  of the point specified by [RFC2131]
      that the server 'MUST NOT' return client identifier' option to the
      client.
	  </t> 
	  
    </section>

    <section anchor="section2" title="Problem Statement">
      <t>[RFC2131] specifies that a combination of 'client identifier' or
      'chaddr' and assigned network address constitute a unique identifier for
      the client's lease and are used by both the client and server to
      identify a lease referred in any DHCP messages. [RFC2131] also specifies
      that the server "MUST NOT" return 'client identifier' in DHCPOFFER and
      DHCPACK messages. DHCP relay agents and servers, following these
      recommendations MAY drop the DHCP packets in the absence of both 'client
      identifier' and 'chaddr'.</t>

      <t>In some cases, client may not be having valid hardware address value
      to be filled in 'chaddr' field of the packet and hence may set this
      field as zero. One such example is when DHCP is used to assign IP
      address to a mobile phone or a tablet and where the 'chaddr' field is
      set to zero in DHCP request packets. In such cases, client usually sets
      the 'client identifier' option field (to a value as permitted in
      [RFC2131]), and both client and server use this field to uniquely
      identify the client with in a subnet.</t>

      <t>Note that due to above mentioned recommendations in [RFC2131], valid
      downstream DHCP packets (DHCPOFFER, DHCPACK and DHCPNAK) from the server
      MAY get dropped at the DHCP relay agent in the absence of 'client
      identifier' option when 'chaddr' field is set as zero.</t>

      <t>The problem may get aggravated when a client receives a response from
      the server without 'client identifier' and with 'chaddr' value set to
      zero, as it cannot guarantee that the response is intended for it. This
      is because even though the 'xid' field is present to map responses with
      requests, this field alone cannot guarantee that a particular response
      is for a particular client, as 'xid' values generated by multiple
      clients within a subnet need not be unique.</t>

	  <t>Lack of 'client identifier' option in DHCP reply messages also affects
      the scenario where multiple DHCP clients may be running on the same
      host sharing the same 'chaddr'. </t>
	  
      <t>This document attempts to address these problems faced by DHCP relay
      agent and client by proposing modification to DHCP server behavior. The
      proposed solution is in line with DHCPv6 [RFC3315] where the server
      always includes the Client Identifier option in the Reply messages.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="section3" title="Proposed Modification To [RFC2131]">
      <t>If the 'client identifier' option is set in a message received from a
      client, the server MUST return the 'client identifier' option,
      unaltered, in its response message.</t>

      <t>Following table is extracted from section 4.3.1 of [RFC2131] and
      relevant fields are modified accordingly to overcome the problems
      mentioned in this document.</t>

	  <t>
	  When a client receives a DHCP message containing a 'client identifier' 
	  option, the client MUST compare that client identifier to the one it
	  is configured to send.   If the two client identifiers do not match,
	  the client MUST silently discard the message.
