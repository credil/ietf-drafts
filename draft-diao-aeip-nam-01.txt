Abstract                                                                
                                                                        
   The two key issues of today's Internet are autonomy and 
   extensibility. Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology can provide 
   extensible internet architecture, own independent root DNS servers
   and self management internet network; Furthermore, based on the 
   Autonomous Internet, here provides a way with extensible address 
   capacity to solve IP address deficiency and realize 
   Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP) with global network address 
   and multiplexing local network address. This AEIP with Network
   Address Multiplexing(AEIP NAM) can realize autonomy and extensibility
   with minimal cost.

1.  Introduction                                                        
                                                                        
   Internet has become an important strategic resource for its rapid
   development all over the world. Therefore, to solve the two key
   issues of Internet, autonomy and scalability, is particularly
   important.
   
   The essence of Internet autonomous problem is to solve the domain
   name problem, so as to provide extensible architecture, provide
   multi-polar, self-control, self-management over the Internet, own 
   independent root domain name server in each autonomous internet (AIP)
   network, and safeguard global Internet without quarrel.
   
   The essence of Internet scalability problem is to solve the IP
   address shortage problem. Private network solution, dynamic address
   assignment technology, VLSM technology and NAT technology proposed
   in the field can only slow down the speed of the IP address
   depletion. Due to slow progress and many unsolved problems, IPv6 can
   not timely solve the IP address shortage problem and meet the needs
   of rapid developing Internet. The huge demand of Internet encourages
   that people must seriously consider the scalability of the IP
   network in reality.
   
   This article will discuss the IP network's scalability on the
   base of Autonomous Internet, so as to solve the current problems
   caused by IP address shortage, to realize the autonomy and extension
   of the Internet.
                                                        
                                                                        
1.1.  Specification of Requirements                                     
                                                                        
   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements 
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key   
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document  
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].                     
                                                                        
2.  Autonomous Internet Technology

   Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology provides a way to own independent
   root domain name servers to realize Autonomous Internet without
   necessary to overturn the Internet infrastructure. It provides 
   Internet global equality, secure autonomy, green extensibility.

   According to the AIP autonomous DNS, the domain name hierarchy can
   be designed distributedly and provide each AIP network autonomy; 
   Each AIP network has its root DNS servers, which are responsible 
   for all the DNS resolution in this AIP network. Other DNS
   servers of this AIP network should point to these root DNS servers by
   default. Each AIP network is almost the same as the current Internet,
   and the internal domain name resolution and IP node communication
   have not any change. The only change is that the destination domain
   name need add domain name suffix of the destination AIP network when
   IP nodes communicate between different AIP networks. Domain node
   "www.yahoo.com" in network B is expressed as "www.yahoo.com.B" for
   its external domain name. So each AIP domain name hierarchy tree
   adds the top-level domain name "ex(i)", so as to map the other
   external AIP domain name hierarchy trees accessible from this AIP
   network. When ex(i)=B, it means that the other AIP network B is
   accessible from this AIP network. At the same time, each AIP network
   will add a kind of device called "AIP DNS gateway" to support domain
   name resolution between AIP networks.
                                      
3.  Autonomous Extensible Internet (AEIP NAM)

   Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP) is feasible not only in
   practice but also in technology. In practice, the communication
   traffic is relatively much smaller between different languages and
   cultures, and convergence of language and communication traffic
   brings the reality of Internet autonomy. In technology, AIP can
   deploy easily and cause the least change, provide security, autonomy
   and extension in architecture. AIP is distributed Internet
   architecture. This architectural distribution provides more choices
   and possibilities in solving IP address deficiency problem.
   
   Hereinafter, a technology would be introduced to realize extensible
   Internet, which is so call Autonomous Extensible Internet with
   Network Address Multiplexing (AEIP NAM). AEIP NAM mainly adopts
   global network address, and multiplex local network address, which
   is based on AIP architecture.
                                                                        
3.1.  Network Extensible Design                                          
                                                                        
   AIP can not only solve the Internet autonomous problem but also
   make architecture extensible with its distributed architecture. 
   The internet network can realize extension by adding some AIP
   network entities as need. But IP network address deficiency makes
   it necessary to further achieve scalability on the IP network
   address, so as to realize the extensible Internet indeed. IP network
   scalable address space realization method is described as following:

   First of all, the Global Network Address(GNA, namely public IP
   address) is adopted for interoperability between different AIP
   networks. Unique GNA between AIP networks need global negotiation and
   unified plan. (In special situation, it can be negotiated and planed 
   by directly connected AIP networks themselves.) Different GNA ranges 
   will be arranged to different AIP networks. GNA is assigned for IP 
   node used for global server or mainly used for interoperability 
   among AIP networks. Here would not be any change to current global
   communication with public IP address. After new added AIP network
   realize autonomy by AIP technology, it can use current or reserved
   public IP address for inter-network communication. Therefore,
   current Internet public IP address space arrangement can almost keep
   unchanged. 
   
   Secondly, based on each AIP network, the concept of "Local Network
   Address(LNA)" is introduced to extend global Internet IP address
   quantity. LNA is only used for inner communication within AIP network
   as need. LNA consists of considerable ratio part of the whole IPv4
   32-bit address capacity. It is designed for AIP single system and
   can be multiplexed for each different AIP single system. 
   Now the IP address is almost exhausted up, so LNA needs 
   to be converted from public IP address, no matter whether these 
   public IP addresses are already in actual use or not. Then 
   the total available IP addresses of each AIP network is the sum of 
   reusable LNA and unique GNA arranged for this AIP network. 
   For example, if the multiplexing LNA occupies 1/4 ratio of
   the total IP address space, namely about 1 billion IP addresses, so
   there are billions of addresses besides its currently used GNA for
   each AIP network and can satisfy its address quantity requirement.
   Furthermore, multiple AIP networks can be added as need and provide
   additional times of available IP address quantity. Generally in each
   AIP network, IP nodes only configure LNA or GNA and they can
   communicate to each other peer-to-peer directly. AEIP NAM network
   is almost the same as AIP network in Autonomous Internet technology.
   Its internal communication is independent from external AIP network
   and it is not necessary any upgrade and transformation for current
   IP nodes.
   
   Moreover, Private Network Address (PNA, namely private IP address)
   would still keep using as multiplexing private network address
   within each AIP network of AEIP NAM.

3.2.  DNS Firewall
   
   In order to realize AIP network's thoroughly independent domain
   name management and avoid internal domain name revealed to other
   AIP networks, domain name can be isolated by AIP network DNS gateway
   in AEIP NAM.
   
   In order to prevent unauthorized access to AIP network internal
   domain name from other AIP networks, domain name range opened to
   other AIP network access can be set in this AIP network DNS gateway
   ingress.
   
   Correspondingly, in order to prevent unauthorized access to other
   AIP network internal domain name from this AIP network, domain name
   range opened to this AIP network access can be set in this AIP
   network DNS gateway egress.
   
3.3.   Address Firewall

   In order to prevent causing confusion and avoid LNA used in this
   AIP network revealed to other AIP networks, LNA can be isolated by
   AIP network firewall in AEIP NAM.
   
   In order to prevent IP packet with LNA in its source address field
   or destination address field infiltrating into this AIP network from
   other AIP networks, access denial to IP packet with LNA in its
   source address field from other AIP networks should be set in this
   AIP network firewall ingress; and access denial to IP packet with
   LNA in its destination address field from other AIP networks should
   be set in this AIP network firewall ingress.
   
   IP nodes using LNA is generally only suitable for AIP network
   internal communication. In order to prevent IP packet with LNA in
   its source address field or destination address field infiltrating
   into other AIP networks from this AIP network, access denial to
   IP packet with LNA in its destination address field from this
   AIP network should be set in this AIP network firewall egress.
   
   Moreover, access denial to IP packet with LNA in its source address
   field from this AIP network should be set in this AIP network
   firewall egress. Or some unidirectional dynamic communication
   between AIP networks such as web browsing, can be implemented by
   simple NAT method and might have some service limitation.

3.4.   Extensible Address Capacity
                                    
   Based on the extensible network architecture of autonomous internet,
   AEIP NAM designs a set of multiplexing address space and can always
   provide a set of ready address space for new added single AIP
   network system entity. Thus it can effectively solve IP address
   deficiency problem of Internet and remove the barrier to Internet
   extension.
   
   This set of multiplexing address space includes three parts:
   the LNA L, the GNA G and the Private Network Address P. These
   three types of network addresses are divided properly using
   existing Internet 32-bit address space C. The size of the existing
   Internet address space is C=2^32, and P=2^16+2^20+2^24. Then we
   have C=G+L+P and approximately
               C=G+L                                 (1)
                                                                     
   The GNA subspace is not for multiplexing. The LNA resources in
   each AIP network of AEIP NAM include a certain proportion of address
   space of existing Internet, and they can be multiplexed in different
   AIP network. In general, all IP nodes can communicate with each
   other directly within each AIP network no matter they are assigned
   LNA or GNA. But only IP nodes which are assigned GNA in one AIP
   network can communicate directly with those nodes that are assigned
   GNA in other AIP networks.
   
   Assume that there are m of such AIP networks, each of them has
   GNA quantity g(i) and LNA quantity l(i). Then the total capacity
   of the AEIP NAM extensible address space C' can be counted as 
               C'=m*[g(i)+l(i)]                      (2)
   
   Since the LNA is multiplexed in different AIP networks and each
   AIP network can use the entire LNA space L, so the maximum total
   capacity of the AEIP NAM address space 
               C'max=m*[g(i)+L]=C+(m-1)L             (3)
   
   According to (3), we can obtain the Change trend figure of total
   address extension capacity. The maximum address capacity C'max 
   increases linearly when the AIP network number m increasing with
   specific ratio LNA capacity. In this way, the design of AEIP NAM
   can add AIP networks as need and greatly increase the IP address
   capacity synchronously. So the extension of network is achievable.

3.5.   Constraint Condition of Extensible Address Space

   According to the statistics, most of the several thousand languages
   surviving currently have less than 100 thousand users, so call
   "ethnic language". Some of them have only thousands of or even
   hundreds of users. The 90% of them will disappear after several
   generations. There are about 200-250 languages which have more than
   1 million users. Twelve languages among them have more than 100
   million users, which cover most of the countries all over the
   world (the simple accumulative total number of countries is 201)
   and is used by over 3.5 billion users or 60% of the world
   population. 
   
   The six work languages approved formally by United Nations are
   English, French, Russian, Chinese, Spanish and Arabic. The
   population using Chinese is 907 million or 15% of the world
   population. There are over 1.3 billion people in China and most of
   them use Chinese while some minorities use their own languages.
   The population using English are 456 million, but the number of
   people who are learning English is more than 1 billion. English
   is the most powerful language in the world and is used as official
   language by 75 countries all over the world. In addition, French
   has been applied widely in the international social and diplomatic
   activities, whose rank is only secondary to English. It is not only
   the official language of France, but also the official language or
   common language of 42 countries or regions in five continents. The
   population speaking French are about 120 million including over
   50 million native French.
   
   Therefore, in order to aggregate the great communication traffic
   using the same language, a single AIP network need to reach about
   1 billion users or C/4 IP address scale at least. So the capacity
   of Local Network Address L designed in Autonomous Extensible
   Internet AEIP NAM should be greater than or equal to C/4. Thus
   the capacity of Global Network Address G is less than or equal to
   3C/4 according to (1). In addition, the design idea of AEIP NAM
   is mainly based on the global address. The capacity of Global
   Network Address G should be greater than or equal to C/2 and L is
   less than or equal to C/2 accordingly. So the constraint condition
   of AEIP NAM extensible address space is
 	             L~[C/4,C/2]; G~[3C/4,C/2]             (4)

   Based on Autonomous Internet architecture, Autonomous Extensible
   Internet with Network Address Multiplexing (AEIP NAM) mainly
   adopts Global Network Address, and multiplexes Local Network Address
   to realize extensible Internet. It provides an integrated solution
   to Internet autonomy and extension issues. In practice, it has
   little reformation work, smooth transition and can be implemented
   even in unilateral technical action to realize Autonomous 
   Extensible Internet.

                                                              
5.  Security Considerations                                             
                                                                        
   There is no additional security requirement than current Internet 
   system. Security issues are not discussed in this memo.              
                                                                        
                                                                        
6.  IANA Considerations                                                 
                                                                        
   According to the AEIP NAM solution and the constraint condition of
   extensible address space, IANA need to plan proper ratio
   of GNA and LNA in 32-bit IP version 4 address capacity and adjust 
   their assignment in different AIP networks.
