Abstract

   This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprotocol
   Label Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths.  A proxy ping
   request is sent to any Label Switching Routers along a Label Switched
   Path.  The primary motivations for this facility are first to limit
   the number of messages and related processing when using LSP Ping in
   large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to enable leaf to leaf/
   root tracing.

Internet-Draft               Proxy LSP Ping                February 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document is motivated by two broad issues in connection with
   diagnosing P2MP LSPs.  The first is scalability due to the automatic
   replication of MPLS Echo Request Messages as they proceed down the
   tree.  The second, which is primarily motivated by mLDP, is the
   ability to trace a sub-LSP from leaf node to root node.

   It is anticipated that very large Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and
   Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) will
   exist.  Further it is anticipated that many of the applications for
   P2MP/MP2MP tunnels will require OAM that is both rigorous and
   scalable.

   Suppose one wishes to trace a P2MP LSP to localize a fault which is
   affecting one egress or a set of egresses.  Suppose one follows the
   normal procedure for tracing - namely repeatedly pinging from the
   root, incrementing the TTL by one after each three or so pings.  Such
   a procedure has the potential for producing a large amount of
   processing at the P2MP-LSP midpoints and egresses.  It also could
   produce an unwieldy number of replies back to the root.

   One alternative would be to begin sending pings from points at or
   near the affected egress(es) and working backwards toward the root.
   The TTL could be held constant as say two, limiting the number of
   responses to the number of next-next-hops of the point where a ping
   is initiated.

   In the case of RSVP-TE, all setup is initiated from the root of the
   tree.  Thus, the root of the tree has knowledge of all the leaf nodes
   and usually the topology of the entire tree.  Thus the above
   alternative can easily be initiated by the root node.

   In mLDP the situation is quite different.  Leaf nodes initiate
   connection to the tree which is granted by the first node that is
   part of the tree.  The root node may only be aware of the immediately
   adjacent (downstream) nodes of the tree.  Initially the leaf node
   only has knowledge of the node it is immediately adjacent to
   (upstream) in the tree.  However this is sufficient to initiate a
   trace by applying the above alternative to the last link in the tree.
   That is, by requesting the upstream node to send an MPLS Echo Request
   for the FEC of the tree in question on said link.  By adding an
   additional capability to inquire the upstream node of its upstream
   node, the procedure can interatively be applied until the fault is
   localized or the root node is reached.  In all cases the TTL for the
   request need only be at most 2.  Thus the processing load of each
   request is small as only a limited number of nodes will receive the
   request.

Internet-Draft               Proxy LSP Ping                February 2013


   This document defines protocol extensions to MPLS ping [RFC4379] to
   allow a third party to remotely cause an MPLS echo request message to
   be sent down a Label Switched Path (LSP) or part of an LSP.  The
   procedure described in the paragraphs above does require that the
   initiator know the previous-hop node to the one which was pinged on
   the prior iteration.  This information is readily available in
   [RFC4875].  This document also provides a means for obtaining this
   information for [RFC6388].

   While the motivation for this document came from multicast scaling
   concerns, it's applicability may be wider.  However other uses of
   this facility are beyond the scope of this document.  In particular,
   the procedures defined in this document only allow testing of a FEC
   stack consisting of a single FEC.  It also does not allow the
   initiator to specify the label assigned to that FEC, nor does it
   allow the initiator to cause any additional labels to be added to the
   label stack of the actual MPLS echo request message.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   The term "Must Be Zero" (MBZ) is used in object descriptions for
   reserved fields.  These fields MUST be set to zero when sent and
   ignored on receipt.

   Based on context the terms leaf and egress are used interchangeably.
   Egress is used where consistency with[RFC4379] was deemed
   appropriate.  Receiver is used in the context of receiving protocol
   messages.

   [Note (to be removed after assignments occur): <tba> = to be assigned
   by IANA]


2.  Proxy Ping Overview

   This document defines a protocol interaction between a first node and
   a node which is part of an LSP to allow the first node to request
   that second node initiate an LSP ping for the LSP on behalf of the
   first node.  Two new LSP Ping messages are defined for remote
   pinging: the MPLS proxy ping request and the MPLS proxy ping reply.

   A remote ping operation on a P2MP LSP generally involves at least
   three LSRs; in some scenarios none of these are the ingress (root) or
   an egress (leaf) of the LSP.

Internet-Draft               Proxy LSP Ping                February 2013


   We refer to these nodes with the following terms:

      Initiator - the node which initiates the ping operation by sending
      an MPLS proxy ping request message

      Proxy LSR - the node which is the destination of the MPLS proxy
      request message and potential initiator of the MPLS echo request

      Receiver(s) - the nodes which receive the MPLS echo request
      message

      Responder - A receiver that responds to a MPLS Proxy Ping Request
      or an MPLS Echo Request

   We note that in some scenarios, the initiator could also be the
   responder, in which case the response would be internal to the node.

   The initiator formats an MPLS proxy ping request message and sends it
   to the proxy LSR, a node it believes to be on the path of the LSP.
   This message instructs the proxy LSR to either Reply with Proxy
   information or to send a MPLS echo request inband of the LSP.  The
   initiator requests Proxy information so that it can learn additional
   information it needs to use to form a subsequent MPLS Proxy Ping
   request.  For example during LSP traceroute an initiator needs the
   downstream map information to form an Echo request.  An initiator may
   also want to learn a Proxy LSR's FEC neighbor information so that it
   can form proxy request to various nodes along the LSP.

   The proxy LSR either replies with the requested Proxy information or
   it validates that it has a label mapping for the specified FEC and
   that it is authorized to send the specified MPLS echo request on
   behalf of the initiator.

   If the proxy LSR has a label mapping for the FEC and all
   authorization checks have passed, the proxy LSR formats an MPLS echo
   request.  If the source address of the MPLS echo request is not to be
   set to the Proxy Request source address, the initiator must include a
   Reply-to Address object containing the source address to use in the
   MPLS echo request.  It then sends it inband of the LSP.

   The receivers process the MPLS echo request as normal, sending their
   MPLS echo replies back to the initiator.

   If the proxy LSR failed to send a MPLS echo request as normal because
   it encountered an issue while attempting to send, a MPLS proxy ping
   reply message is sent back with a return code indicating that the
   MPLS echo request could not be sent.

3.  Proxy MPLS Echo Request / Reply Procedures

3.1.  Procedures for the initiator

   The initiator creates an MPLS proxy ping request message.

   The message MUST contain a Target FEC Stack that describes the FEC
   being tested.  The topmost FEC in the target FEC stack is used at the
   Proxy LSR to lookup the MPLS label stack that will be used to
   encapsulate the MPLS echo request packet.

   The MPLS Proxy Ping message MUST contain a Proxy Echo Parameters
   object.  In that object, the address type is set to either IPv4 or
   IPv6.  The Destination IP Address is set to the value to be used in
   the MPLS echo request packet.  If the Address Type is IPv4, an
   address is from the range 127/8.  If the Address Type is IPv6, an
   address is from the range ::FFFF:7F00:0/104.

   The Reply mode and Global Flags of the Proxy Echo Parameters object
   are set to the values to be used in the MPLS echo request message
   header.  The Source UDP Port is set to the value to be used in the
   MPLS echo request packet.  The TTL is set to the value to be used in
   the outgoing MPLS label stack.  See Section 5.1 for further details.

   If the FEC's Upstream/Downstream Neighbor address information is
   required, the initiator sets the "Request for FEC neighbor
   information" Proxy Flags in the Proxy Echo Parameters object.

   If a Downstream Detailed or Downstream Mapping TLV is required in a
   MPLS Proxy Ping Reply, the initiator sets the "Request for Downstream
   Detailed Mapping" or "Request for Downstream Mapping" Proxy Flags in
   the Proxy Echo Parameters object.  Only one of the two flags can be
   set.

   The Proxy Request reply mode is set with one of the reply modes
   defined in [RFC4379] as appropriate.

   A list of Next Hop IP Addresses MAY be included to limit the next
   hops towards which the MPLS echo request message will be sent.  These
   are encoded as Next Hop sub-objects and included in the Proxy Echo
   Parameters object.

   Proxy Echo Parameter object MPLS payload size field may be set to
   request that the MPLS echo request (including any IP and UDP header)
   be zero padded to the specified size.  When the payload size is non
   zero, if sending the MPLS Echo Request involves using an IP header,
   the DF bit MUST be set to 1.

   Any of following objects MAY be included; these objects will be
   copied into the MPLS echo request messages:

      Pad

      Vendor Enterprise Number

      Reply TOS Byte

      P2MP Responder Identifier [RFC6425]

      Echo Jitter TLV [RFC6425]

      Vendor Private TLVs

   Downstream Detailed Mapping or Downstream Mapping objects MAY be
   included.  These objects will be matched to the next hop address for
   inclusion in those particular MPLS echo request messages.

   The message is then encapsulated in a UDP packet.  The source UDP
   port is chosen by the initiator; the destination UDP port is set to
   3503.  The IP header is set as follows: the source IP address is a
   routable address of the initiator; the destination IP address is a
   routable address to the Proxy LSR.  The packet is then sent with the
   IP TTL is set to 255.

3.2.  Procedures for the proxy LSR

   A proxy LSR that receives an MPLS proxy ping request message, parses
   the packet to ensure that it is a well-formed packet.  It checks that
   the TLVs that are not marked "Ignore" are understood.  If not, it
   sets the Return Code set to "Malformed echo request received" or "TLV
   not understood" (as appropriate), and the Subcode set to zero.  If
   the Reply Mode of the message header is not 1(Do not reply), an MPLS
   proxy ping reply message SHOULD be sent as described below.  In the
   latter case, the misunderstood TLVs (only) are included in an Errored
   TLVs object.

   The Proxy LSR checks that the MPLS proxy ping request message did not
   arrive via one of its exception processing paths.  Packets arriving
   via IP TTL expiry, IP destination address set to a Martian address or
   label ttl expiry MUST be treated as "Unauthorized" packets.  An MPLS
   proxy ping reply message MAY be sent with a Return Code of <tba>,
   "Proxy Ping not authorized".

   The header fields Sender's Handle and Sequence Number are not
   examined, but are saved to be included in the MPLS proxy ping reply
   or MPLS echo request messages.

   The proxy LSR validates that it has a label mapping for the specified
   FEC, it then determines if it is an ingress, egress, transit or bud
   node and sets the Return Code as appropriate.  A new return code
   (Replying router has FEC mapping for topmost FEC) has been defined
   for the case where the Proxy LSR is an ingress (for example head of
   the TE tunnel or a transit router) because the existing RFC4379
   return codes don't match the situation.  For example, when a Proxy
   LSR is a transit router, it's not appropriate for the return code to
   describe how the packet would transit because the Proxy Request
   doesn't contain information about what input interface the an MPLS
   echo request would be switched from at the Proxy LSR.

   The proxy LSR then determines if it is authorized to send the
   specified MPLS echo request on behalf of the initiator.  A Proxy LSR
   MUST be capable of filtering addresses to validate initiators.  Other
   filters on FECs or MPLS echo request contents MAY be applied.  If a
   filter has been invoked (i.e. configured) and an address does not
   pass the filter, then an MPLS echo request message MUST NOT be sent,
   and the event SHOULD be logged.  An MPLS proxy ping reply message MAY
   be sent with a Return Code of <tba>, "Proxy Ping not authorized".

   The destination address specified in the Proxy Echo Parameters object
   is checked to ensure that it conforms to the address allowed IPv4 or
   IPv6 address range.  If not, it sets the Return Code set to
   "Malformed echo request received" and the Subcode set to zero.  If
   the Reply Mode of the message header is not 1, an MPLS proxy ping
   reply message SHOULD be sent as described below.

   If the "Request for FEC Neighbor Address info" flag is set, a
   Upstream Neighbor Address Object and/or Downstream Neighbor Address
   Object(s) is/are formatted for inclusion in the MPLS proxy ping
   reply.  If the Upstream or Downstream address is unknown they are not
   included in the Proxy Reply.

   If there are Next Hop sub-objects in the Proxy Echo Parameters
   object, each address is examined to determine if it is a valid next
   hop for this FEC.  If any are not, Proxy Echo Parameters object
   should be updated removing unrecognized Next Hop sub-objects.  The
   updated Proxy Echo Parameters object MUST be included in the MPLS
   proxy ping reply.

   If the "Request for Downstream Detailed Mapping" or "Request for
   Downstream Mapping" flag is set, the LSR formats (for inclusions in
   the MPLS proxy ping reply) a Downstream Detailed/Downstream Mapping
   object for each interface over which the MPLS echo request will be
   sent.

   If the Proxy LSR is the egress for the FEC, the behavior of the proxy

   LSR vary depending on whether the node is an Egress of a P2P LSP, a
   P2MP LSP or MP2MP LSP.  Additional details can be found in the
   section describing "Handling when Proxy LSR it is egress for FEC".

   If the Reply Mode of the Proxy Request message header is "1 - do not
   reply", no MPLS proxy ping reply is sent.  Otherwise an MPLS proxy
   ping reply message or MPLS echo request should be sent as described
   below.

3.2.1.  Proxy LSR Handling when it is Egress for FEC

   This sections describes the different behaviors for the Proxy LSR
   when it's the Egress for the FEC.  In the P2MP budnode and MP2MP
   budnode and egress cases, different behavior is required.

   When the Proxy LSR is the egress of a P2P FEC, a Proxy reply should
   be sent to the initiator with the return code set to 3 (Reply router
   is Egress for FEC) with return subcode set to 0.

   When the Proxy LSR is the egress of a P2MP FEC, it can be either a
   budnode or just an Egress.  If the Proxy LSR is a Budnode, a Proxy
   reply should be sent to the initiator with the return code set to 3
   (Reply router is Egress for FEC) with return subcode set to 0 and DS/
   DDMAPs only if the Proxy initiator requested information to be
   returned in a Proxy reply.  If the Proxy LSR is a Budnode but not
   requested to return a Proxy reply, the Proxy LSR should send packets
   to the downstream neighbors (no Echo reply is sent to the Proxy
   Initiator to indicate that the Proxy LSR is an egress).  If the Proxy
   LSR is just an egress, a Proxy reply should be sent to the initiator
   with the return code set to 3 (Reply router is Egress for FEC) with
   return subcode set to 0.

   When the Proxy LSR is the egress of a MP2MP FEC, it can be either a
   budnode or just an Egress.  LSP pings sent from a leaf of a MP2MP has
   different behavior in this case.  MPLS echo request are sent to all
   upstream/downstream neighbors.  The Proxy LSRs need to be consistent
   with this variation in behavior.  If the Proxy LSR is a Budnode or
   just an egress, a Proxy reply should be sent to the initiator with
   the return code set to 3 (Reply router is Egress for FEC) with return
   subcode set to 0 and DS/DDMAPs included only if the Proxy initiator
   requested information to be returned in a Proxy reply.  If the Proxy
   LSR is not requested to return information in a proxy reply, the
   Proxy LSR should send packets to all upstream/downstream neighbors as
   would be done when sourcing an LSP ping from a M2MP leaf (no echo
   reply is sent to the Proxy initiator indicating that the Proxy LSR is
   an egress).

Internet-Draft               Proxy LSP Ping                February 2013


3.2.2.  Downstream Detailed/Downstream Maps in Proxy Reply

   When the Proxy LSR is a transit or bud node, downstream maps
   corresponding to how the packet is transited can not be supplied
   unless an ingress interface for the MPLS echo request is specified,
   since this information is not available and since all valid output
   paths are of interest, the Proxy LSR should include DS/DDMAP(s) to
   describe the entire set of paths that the packet can be replicated,
   like in the case where an LSP ping is initiated at the Proxy LSR.
   For mLDP there is a DSMAP/DDMAP per upstream/downstream neighbor for
   MP2MP LSPs, or per downstream neighbor in the P2MP LSP case.

   When the Proxy LSR is a bud node or egress in a MP2MP LSP or a
   budnode in a P2MP LSP, an LSP ping initiated from the Proxy LSR would
   source packets only to the neighbors but not itself despite the fact
   that the Proxy LSR is itself an egress for the FEC.  In order to
   match the behavior as seen from LSP Ping initiated at the Proxy LSR,
   the Proxy Reply should contain DSMAP/DDMAPs for only the paths to the
   upstream/downstream neighbors, but no DSMAP/DDMAP describing its own
   egresses paths.  The proxy LSR identifies that it's an egress for the
   FEC using a different Proxy Reply return code.  The Proxy reply
   return code is either set to "Reply router has a mapping for the
   topmost FEC" or "Reply router is Egress for the FEC".

3.2.3.  Sending an MPLS proxy ping reply

   The Reply mode, Sender's Handle and Sequence Number fields are copied
   from the proxy ping request message.  The objects specified above are
   included.  The message is encapsulated in a UDP packet.  The source
   IP address is a routable address of the proxy LSR; the source port is
   the well-known UDP port for LSP ping.  The destination IP address and
   UDP port are copied from the source IP address and UDP port of the
   echo request.  The IP TTL is set to 255.

3.2.4.  Sending the MPLS echo requests

   A base MPLS echo request is formed as described in the next section.
   The section below that describes how the base MPLS echo request is
   sent on each interface.

3.2.4.1.  Forming the base MPLS echo request

   A Next_Hop_List is created as follows.  If Next Hop sub-objects were
   included in the received Proxy Parameters object, the Next_Hop_List
   created from the address in those sub-objects as adjusted above.
   Otherwise, the list is set to all the next hops to which the FEC
   would be forwarded.

   The proxy LSR then formats an MPLS echo request message.  The Global
   Flags and Reply Mode are copied from the Proxy Echo Parameters
   object.  The Return Code and Return Subcode are set to zero.

   The Sender's Handle and Sequence Number are copied from the remote
   echo request message.

   The TimeStamp Sent is set to the time-of-day (in seconds and
   microseconds) that the echo request is sent.  The TimeStamp Received
   is set to zero.

   If the reply-to address object is present, it is used to set the echo
   request source address, otherwise the echo request source address is
   set to the proxy request source address.

   The following objects are copied from the MPLS proxy ping request
   message.  Note that of these, only the Target FEC Stack is REQUIRED
   to appear in the MPLS proxy ping request message.

      Target FEC Stack

      Pad

      Vendor Enterprise Number

      Reply TOS Byte

      P2MP Responder Identifier [RFC6425]

      Echo Jitter TLV [RFC6425]

      Vendor Private TLVs

   The message is then encapsulated in a UDP packet.  The source UDP
   port is copied from the Proxy Echo Parameters object.  The
   destination port copied from the proxy ping request message.

   The source IP address is set to a routable address specified in the
   reply-to-address object or the source address of the received proxy
   request.  Per usual the TTL of the IP packet is set to 1.

   If the Explicit DSCP flag is set, the Requested DSCP byte is
   examined.  If the setting is permitted then the DSCP byte of the IP
   header of the MPLS Echo Request message is set to that value.  If the
   Proxy LSR does not permit explicit control for the DSCP byte, the
   MPLS Proxy Echo Parameters with the Explicit DSCP flag cleared MUST
   be included in any MPLS proxy ping reply message to indicate why an
   Echo Request was not sent.  The return code MUST be set to <tba>,

   "Proxy ping parameters need to be modified".  If the Explicit DSCP
   flag is not set, the Proxy LSR should set the Echo Request DSCP
   settings to the value normally used to source LSP ping packets..

3.2.4.2.  Per interface sending procedures

   The proxy LSR now iterates through the Next_Hop_List modifying the
   base MPLS echo request to form the MPLS echo request packet which is
   then sent on that particular interface.

   For each next hop address, the outgoing label stack is determined.
   The TTL for the label corresponding to the FEC specified in the FEC
   stack is set such that the TTL on the wire will be othe TTL specified
   in the Proxy Echo Parameters.  If any additional labels are pushed
   onto the stack, their TTLs are set to 255.

   If the MPLS proxy ping request message contained Downstream Mapping/
   Downstream Detailed Mapping objects, they are examined.  If the
   Downstream IP Address matches the next hop address that Downstream
   Mapping object is included in the MPLS echo request.

   The packet is then transmitted on this interface.


4.  Proxy Ping Request / Reply Messages

5.1.  Proxy Echo Parameters Object

   The Proxy Echo Parameters object is a TLV that MUST be included in an
   MPLS Proxy Echo Request message.  The length of the TLV is 12 + K +
   S, where K is the length of the Destination IP Address field and S is
   the total length of the sub-objects.  The Proxy Echo Parameters
   object can be used to either to 1) control attributes used in
   Composing and Sending an MPLS echo request or 2) query the Proxy LSR
   for information about the topmost FEC in the target FEC stack but not
   both.  In the case where the Proxy LSR is being queried (ie
   information needs to be returned in a Proxy Reply), no MPLS echo
   request will be sent from the Proxy LSR.  The MPLS Proxy Echo request
   echo header's Reply Mode should be set to "Reply with Proxy Info".

         values are as specified in [RFC4379].

      Proxy Flags
         The Proxy Request Initiator sets zero, one or more of these
         flags to request actions at the Proxy LSR.

         Request for FEC Neighbor Address info       0x01

            When set this requests that the proxy LSR supply the
            Upstream and Downstream neighbor address information in the
            MPLS proxy ping reply message.  This flag is only applicable
            for the topmost FEC in the FEC stack if the FEC types
            corresponds with a P2MP or MP2MP LSPs.  The Proxy LSR MUST
            respond as applicable with a Upstream Neighbor Address
            Object and Downstream Neighbor Address Object(s) in the MPLS
            Proxy ping reply message.  Upstream Neighbor Address Object
            needs be included only if there is an upstream neighbor.
            Similarly, one Downstream Neighbor Address Object needs to
            be included for each Downstream Neighbor for which the LSR
            learned bindings from.

            Setting this flag will cause the proxy LSR to cancel sending
            an Echo request. Information learned with such proxy reply
            may be used by the proxy initiator to generate subsequent
            proxy requests.

         Request for Downstream Mapping           0x02

            When set this requests that the proxy LSR supply a
            Downstream Mapping object see [RFC4379] in the MPLS
            proxy ping reply message.  It's not valid
            to have Request for Downstream Detailed Mapping flag set
            when this flag is set.

            Setting this flag will cause the proxy LSR to cancel sending
            an Echo request. Information learned with such proxy reply
            may be used by the proxy initiator to generate subsequent
            proxy requests.

         Request for Downstream Detailed Mapping  0x04

            When set this requests that the proxy LSR supply a
            Downstream Detailed Mapping object see [RFC6424] in the
            MPLS proxy ping reply message.  It's not valid
            to have Request for Downstream Mapping flag set
            when this flag is set.

            Setting this flag will cause the proxy LSR to cancel sending

            an Echo request. Information learned with such proxy reply
            may be used by the proxy initiator to generate subsequent
            proxy requests.


         Explicit DSCP Request                    0x08

            When set this requests that the proxy LSR use
            the supplied "Rqst'd DSCP" byte in the echo request message

      TTL

         The TTL to be used in the label stack entry corresponding to
         the topmost FEC in the in the MPLS Echo Request packet.  Valid
         values are in the range [1,255].  A setting of 0 should be
         ignored by the Proxy LSR.

      Requested DSCP

         This field is valid only if the Explicit DSCP flag is set.  If
         not set, the field MUST be zero on transmission and ignored on
         receipt.  When the flag is set this field contains the DSCP
         value to be used in the MPLS echo request packet IP header.

      Source UDP Port

         The source UDP port to be sent in the MPLS Echo Request packet

      Global Flags

         The Global Flags to be sent in the MPLS Echo Request message

      MPLS Payload Size

         Used to request that the MPLS payload (IP header + UDP header
         + MPLS echo request) be padded using a zero filled Pad TLV
         so that the IP header, UDP header nad MPLS echo request total
         the specified size.  Field set to zero means no
         size request is being made.  If the requested size is less
         than the minimum size required to form the MPLS echo request,
         the request will be treated as a best effort request with
         the Proxy LSR building the smallest possible packet (ie
         not using a Pad TLV).   The IP header DF bit should be set
         when this field is non zero.

      Destination IP Address

         If the Address Type is IPv4, an address from the range 127/8;

         If the Address Type is IPv6, an address from the range
         ::FFFF:7F00:0/104

      Sub-Objects

         A TLV encoded list of sub-objects.  Currently one is defined.

   This sub-object is used to describe a particular next hop towards
   which the Echo Request packet should be sent.  If the topmost FEC in
   the FEC-stack is a multipoint LSP, this sub-object may appear
   multiple times.

       Upstream Address

          The address of the immediate upstream neighbor for the topmost
          FEC in the FEC stack.  If protocol adjacency exists by which
          the label for this FEC was exchanged, this address MUST be the
          address used in that protocol exchange.

       Local Address

          The local address used in the protocol adjacency exists by
          which the label for this FEC was exchanged.

6.  Security Considerations

   The mechanisms described in this document are intended to be used
   within a Service Provider network and to be initiated only under the
   authority of that administration.

   If such a network also carries internet traffic, or permits IP access
   from other administrations, MPLS proxy ping message SHOULD be

   discarded at those points.  This can be accomplished by filtering on
   source address or by filtering all MPLS ping messages on UDP port.

   Any node which acts as a proxy node SHOULD validate requests against
   a set of valid source addresses.  An implementation MUST provide such
   filtering capabilities.

   MPLS proxy ping request messages are IP addressed directly to the
   Proxy node.  If a node which receives an MPLS proxy ping message via
   IP or Label TTL expiration, it MUST NOT be acted upon.

   MPLS proxy ping request messages are IP addressed directly to the
   Proxy node.  If a MPLS Proxy ping request IP destination address is a
   Martian Address, it MUST NOT be acted upon.

   if a MPLS Proxy ping request IP source address is not IP reachable by
   the Proxy LSR, the Proxy request MUST NOT be acted upon.

   MPLS proxy ping requests are limited to making their request via the
   specification of a FEC.  This ensures that only valid MPLS echo
   request messages can be created.  No label spoofing attacks are
   possible.
