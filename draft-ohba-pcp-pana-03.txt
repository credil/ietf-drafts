Internet-Draft          PANA Encapsulation in PCP           October 2012


1.  Introduction

   PCP (Port Control Protocol) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] is used for an IPv6
   or IPv4 host to control how incoming IPv6 or IPv4 packets are
   translated and forwarded by a network address translator (NAT) or by
   a simple firewall.  It also allows a host to optimize its outgoing
   NAT keepalive messages.

   In order to provide integrity protection for PCP messages, a message
   authentication mechanism for PCP is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication].  Three components are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication]: (1) PCP options for providing per-
   packet origin authentication, integrity and replay protection, (2)
   PCP Security Association (SA) for generating the aforementioned
   options, and (3) PCP options for generating PCP SA from execution of
   EAP authentication.

   The third component seems to define a new EAP lower-layer within PCP.
   In this document, PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for
   Network Access) [RFC5191] is proposed instead of defining a new EAP
   lower-layer.  This draft along with other two components described in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication] provides a complete solution which
   otherwise will duplicate the work of transporting EAP over UDP.  The
   proposed solution can run over a single PCP port.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Establishing a PCP SA

   A PCP client should know the authentication capability of the PCP
   server before deciding to use PANA with it.  PCP client can obtain
   this information either via an out-of band scheme (e.g., manual
   configuration, DHCP), or via an in-band scheme (e.g., trial-and-
   error, PCP ANNOUNCE Opcode).  In trial-and-error scheme the PCP
   client tests the PCP server by sending its first request without any
   authentication.  If the PCP server returns AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED
   error message, then the PCP client concludes that the PCP server is
   mandating use of authentication.  Otherwise the PCP client concludes
   that the PCP server is allowing unauthenticated PCP.  See Section 3
   for the details of ANNOUNCE-based discovery.

Internet-Draft          PANA Encapsulation in PCP           October 2012


   A PaC (PANA Client) on a PCP client node initiates PANA
   authentication over the PCP port number (To be assigned) prior to
   sending an authenticated PCP message.  The initiation may be
   requested by the PCP client.  We assume that a PAA (PANA
   Authentication Agent) is implemented on each PCP server that supports
   authenticated PCP messages.  Therefore, the PCP server's IP address
   is used as the address of the PAA.  The PANA authentication for
   establishing a PCP SA is dedicated to the PCP usage only.

   In order to distinguish PANA and PCP messages that are multiplexed
   over the PCP port number (To be assigned), bit 0 of Reserved field of
   PANA header is used and whose value is 1.  In PCP, the corresponding
   bit is part of Version field and whose value is 0, as shown in
   Figure 1.  For this scheme to work, PCP Version values less than 128
   MUST be used.

   |    Reserved     ...

       The first 8 bits of PANA header (bit 0 value is 1)

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
        The first 8 bits of PCP header (bit 0 value is 0)

            Figure 1: The First 8 bits of PANA and PCP Headers

   When a PANA message is carried over the PCP port number (To be
   assigned), the sender MUST set bit 0 of Reserved field.  Other
   Reserved bits and bit 0 when used over port numbers other than the
   PCP port number (To be assigned) are still governed by [RFC5191].

   Upon successful PANA authentication, the message authentication key
   for PCP message is derived from the EAP MSK as follows:

   PCP_AUTH_KEY = prf+(MSK, "IETF PCP" | SID | KID)

   where where | denotes concatenation.

   o  The prf+ function is defined in IKEv2 [RFC5996].  The pseudo-
      random function to be used for the prf+ function is negotiated
      using PRF-Algorithm AVP in the initial PANA-Auth-Request and PANA-

      Auth-Answer exchange with 'S' (Start) bit set, as defined in
      [RFC5191].

   o  "IETF PCP" is the ASCII code representation of the non-NULL
      terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).

   o  SID is a four-octet PANA Session Identifier [RFC5191].

   o  KID is the content of the Key-ID AVP [RFC5191] associated with the
      MSK.

   The same integrity algorithm used for the PANA session MUST be used
   for PCP message authentication.

   The PCP_AUTH_KEY and its associated parameters (i.e., the IP
   addresses of the PCP client and PCP server, PANA Session ID, Key ID,
   message authentication algorithm and lifetime) are passed from the
   PAA application to the PCP server application on the same PCP server
   device, and also passed from the PaC application to the PCP client
   application on the same PCP client node, using an API.  The API can
   be implementation-specific, and therefore is not specified in this
   document.  The PANA Session ID and Key ID are used in the
   corresponding fields (Session ID, Key ID) of the Authentication Tag
   Option.

   Once a PCP SA is established, any PCP message that does not contain a
   valid Authentication Tag and a fresh Nonce under the current PCP SA
   MUST be silently discarded.

   The PCP SA MUST be immediately deleted when the corresponding PANA SA
   is deleted.  The PCP SA SHALL remain as long as the corresponding
   PANA SA exists.

   If the PCP server that requires authenticated PCP message receives an
   unauthenticated PCP request, it returns an "AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED"
   result code.


3.  Authentication Capablity Discovery

   A PCP client supporting PCP authentication MAY send an ANNOUNCE
   request with an AUTH_CAPABILITY option prior to initiating PANA in
   order to know whether a PCP server supports PCP authentication.  A
   PCP server supporting PCP authentication SHALL return an ANNOUNCE
   response with "SUCCESS" result code and an AUTH_CAPABILITY option.

   The AUTH_CAPABILITY Option is formatted in Figure 2.

4.  Security Considerations

   The key provisioning mechanism described in this document provides a
   cryptographic binding between a PANA session and a PCP SA based on
   using the PANA session identifier and key identifier in the
   PCP_AUTH_KEY derivation function.

   For EAP channel binding [RFC6677], it is required for a PAA to
   distinguish whether PANA authentication is conducted for network
   access authentication or PCP authentication.  Such a distinction can
   be made using the assigned port number over which the PANA
   authentication is conducted, namely, the PANA authentication is
   conducted for PCP authentication when the port number is the PCP port
   number (to be assigned), and it is for network access authentication
   when the port number is the PANA port number (716).  How the
   corresponding information is conveyed from the PAA to the
   authentication server is outside the scope of this document.


5.   IANA Considerations

   A new result code for "AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED" needs to be
   allocated.  The usage of the "AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED" result code is
   described in Section 2.

   A new PCP Option for AUTH_CAPABILITY needs to be allocated.  The
   usage of AUTH_CAPABILITY Option is described in Section 3.
