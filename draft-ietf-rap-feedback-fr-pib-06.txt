This document describes a portion of the Policy Information Base
(PIB) to control policy usage collection and reporting in a device.

The provisioning classes specified here allow a Policy Decision
Point (PDP) to select which policy objects should collect usage
information, what information should be collected and when it
should be reported.

This PIB requires the presence of other PIBs (defined elsewhere)
that provide the policy objects from which usage information is
collected.
