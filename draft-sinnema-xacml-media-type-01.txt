1.  Introduction

   The XACML media type contains an XACML request, response, or policy
   [XACML-3].  The request and response allow clients form a query to
   request whether or not a given action should be allowed, and
   interpret the result.  The policy is used to describe general access
   control requirements.

Internet-Draft              XACML Media Type                  March 2013


   This specification registers an XML-based media type for the
   eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) that will be
   registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   following the "Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"
   [RFC6838].  The XACML media type represents an XACML request,
   response, or policy [XACML-3].  The request and response allow
   clients to contact an XACML service and ask whether or not a given
   action should be allowed, and interpret the result.  The policy is
   used to describe general access control requirements.

3.  XACML Media Type application/xacml+xml

   This specification requests the registration of an XML-based media
   type for the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML).

3.1.  Media Type Name

   application

3.2.  Subtype Name

   xacml+xml

3.3.  Required Parameters

   none

3.4.  Optional Parameters

   charset: The charset parameter is the same as the charset parameter
   of application/xml [RFC3023].

   version: The version parameter indicates the version of the XACML
   specification.  It can be used for content negotiation when dealing
   with components that support multiple XACML versions.  Its range is
   the range of published XACML versions.  As of this writing that is:
   1.0 [XACML-1], 1.1 [XACML-1.1], 2.0 [XACML-2], and 3.0 [XACML-3].
   These and future version identifiers are of the form x.y, where x and
   y are decimal numbers with no leading zeros, with x being positive
   and y being non-negative.

3.5.  Encoding Considerations

   Same as for application/xml [RFC3023].

3.6.  Security Considerations

Internet-Draft              XACML Media Type                  March 2013


   Per their specification, application/xacml+xml typed objects do not
   contain executable content.  However, these objects are XML-based,
   and thus they have all of the general security considerations
   presented in section 10 of RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

   XACML [XACML-3] contains information whose integrity and authenticity
   is important - identity provider and service provider public keys and
   endpoint addresses, for example.  Sections 9.2.1 Authentication and
   9.2.4 Policy integrity in XACML [XACML-3] describe requirements and
   considerations for such authentication and integrity protection.

   To counter potential issues, the publisher may sign application/
   xacml+xml typed objects.  Any such signature should be verified by
   the recipient of the data - both as a valid signature, and as being
   the signature of the publisher.  The XACML v3.0 XML Digital Signature
   Profile [XACML-3-DSig] describes how to use XML-based digital
   signatures with XACML.

   Additionally, various of the possible publication protocols, for
   example HTTPS, offer means for ensuring the authenticity of the
   publishing party and for protecting the policy in transit.

   For a more detailed discussion of XACML policy and its security
   considerations, please see XACML 3.0 [XACML-3] and the associated XML
   Digital Signature Profile [XACML-3].

3.7.  Interoperability Considerations

   XACML 3.0 uses the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17 XML
   namespace URI.  XACML 2.0 uses the
   urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:policy XML namespace URI.  Signed XACML
   has a wrapping SAML 2.0 assertion [SAML-2], which uses the
   urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion namespace URI.
   Interoperability with SAML is defined by the SAML 2.0 Profile of
   XACML [XACML-3-SAML] for all versions of XACML.

3.8.  Applications which use this media type

   Potentially any application implementing XACML, as well as those
   applications implementing specifications based on XACML.

3.9.  Magic number(s)

   In general, the same as for application/xml [2].  In particular, the
   XML document element of the returned object will be one of
   xacml:Policy, xacml:PolicySet, context:Request, or context:Response.
   The xacml and context prefixes differ for the various versions of
   XACML as follows:

Internet-Draft              XACML Media Type                  March 2013


   o  1.0 & 1.1: The xacml prefix maps to
      urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy, the context prefix maps to
      urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context

   o  2.0: The xacml prefix maps to urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:policy,
      the context prefix maps to urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context

   o  3.0: Both the xacml and context prefixes map to the namespace URI
      urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17

   For signed XACML, the XML document element is saml:Assertion, where
   the saml prefix maps to the SAML 2.0 namespace URI
   urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion

3.10.  File extension(s)

   none

3.11.  Macintosh File Type Code(s)

   none

3.12.  Person & email address to contact for further information

   This registration is made on behalf of the OASIS eXtensible Access
   Control Markup Language Technical Committee (XACMLTC).  Please refer
   to the XACMLTC website for current information on committee
   chairperson(s) and their contact addresses: http://www.oasis-open.org
   /committees/xacml/. Committee members should submit comments and
   potential errata to the xacml@lists.oasis-open.org list.  Others
   should submit them by filling out the web form located at http://www
   .oasis-open.org/committees/comments/form.php?wg_abbrev=xacml.

   Additionally, the XACML developer community email distribution list,
   xacml-dev@lists.oasis-open.org, may be employed to discuss usage of
   the application/xacml+xml MIME media type.  The xacml-dev mailing
   list is publicly archived here: http://www.oasis-open.org/archives/
   xacml-dev/. To post to the xacml-dev mailing list, one must subscribe
   to it.  To subscribe, visit the OASIS mailing list page at http://www

   The XACML specification sets are a work product of the OASIS
   eXtensible Access Control Markup Language Technical Committee
   (XACMLTC).  OASIS and the XACMLTC have change control over the XACML
   specification sets.

4.  Change Log

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   o  Added new introduction text.

   o  Changed reference from RFC 4288 to RFC 6838 (updated RFC for media
      type registrations).

4.2.  Versions prior to I-D -00

   Prior to being published as a I-D document, this document was
   published and revised as an OASIS document with the following
   versions:

   o  2012-02-29 (WD01): Initial revision with one media type.

   o  2012-04-23 (WD02): Added JSON media type.

   o  2012-04-24 (WD03): Fixed layout, typos, and references.  Better
      defined the allowable range of values for the version parameter.
