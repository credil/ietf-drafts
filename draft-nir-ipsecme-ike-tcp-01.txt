Abstract

   This document describes using TCP for IKE messages.  This facilitates

Internet-Draft                IKE over TCP                     July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) specified in [RFC2407] and [RFC2408],
   and IKEv2 as specified in [RFC5996] uses UDP to transport the
   exchange messages.  Some of those messages may be fairly large.
   Specifically, the 5th and 6th messages of IKEv1 Main Mode, the first
   and second messages of IKEv1 Aggressive Mode, and the messages of
   IKEv2 IKE_AUTH exchange can become quite large, as they may contain a
   chain of certificates, a signature payload (called "Auth" in IKEv2),
   CRLs, and in the case of IKEv2, some configuration information that
   is carried in the CFG payload.

   When such UDP packets exceed the path MTU, they get fragmented.  This
   increases the probability of packets getting dropped, but the
   retransmission mechanisms in IKE (as described in section 2.1 of RFC
   5996) takes care of that.  More recently we have seen a number of
   service providers dropping fragmented packets.  Firewalls and NAT
   devices need to keep state for each packet where some but not all of
   the fragments have been received.  This creates a burden in terms of
   memory, especially for high capacity devices such as Carrier-Grade
   NAT (CGN) or high capacity firewalls.

   The BEHAVE working group has an Internet Draft describing required
   behavior of CGNs ([I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements]).  It requires
   CGNs to comply with [RFC4787], which in section 11 requires NAT
   devices to support fragments.  However, some people deploying IKE
   have found that some ISPs have begun to drop fragments in preparation
   for deploying CGNs.  While we all hope for a future where all devices
   comply with the emerging standards, or even a future where CGNs are
   not required, we have to make IKE work today.

   The solution described in this document is to transport the IKE
   messages over a TCP ([RFC0793]) rather than over UDP.  IKE packets
   (both versions) describe their own length, so they are well-suited
   for transport over a stream-based connection such as TCP.  The
   Initiator opens a TCP connection to the Responder's port 500, sends
   the requests and receives the responses, and then closes the
   connection.  TCP can handle arbitrary-length messages, works well
   with any sized data, and is well supported by all ISP infrastructure.

1.1.  Non-Goals of this Specification

   Firewall traversal is not a goal of this specification.  If a
   firewall has a policy to block IKE and/or IPsec, hiding the IKE
   exchange in TCP is not expected to help.  Some implementations hide
   both IKE and IPsec in a TCP connection, usually pretending to be
   HTTPS by using port 443.  This has a significant impact on bandwidth
   and gateway capacity, and even this is defeated by better firewalls.

   SSL VPNs tunnel IP packets over TLS, but the latest firewalls are
   also TLS proxies, and are able to defeat this as well.

   This document is not part of that arms race.  It is only meant to
   allow IKE to work When faced with broken infrastructure that drops
   large IP packets.

1.2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  The Protocol

2.1.  Initiator

   An Initiator MAY try IKE using TCP for any request.  It opens a TCP
   connection from an arbitrary port to port 500 of the Responder.  When
   the three-way handshake completes, the Initiator MUST send the
   request.  If the Initiator knows that this request is the last
   request needed at this time, it SHOULD half-close the TCP connection,
   although it MAY wait until the last response is received.  When all
   responses have been received, the Initiator MUST close the
   connection.  If the peer has closed the connection before all
   requests have been transmitted or responded to, the Initiator SHOULD
   either open a new TCP connection or transmit them over UDP again.

   It MUST accept responses sent over IKE within the same connection,
   but MUST also accept responses over other transports, if the request
   had been sent over them as well.

2.2.  Responder

   A Responder MAY accept TCP connections to port 500, and if it does,
   it MUST accept IKE requests over this connection.  Responses to
   requests received over this connection MUST also go over this
   connection.  If the connection has closed before the Responder had
   had a chance to respond, it MUST NOT respond over UDP, but MUST
   instead wait for a retransmission over UDP or over another TCP
   connection.

   The responder MUST accept different requests on different transports.
   Specifically, the Responder MUST NOT rely on subsequent requests
   coming over the same transport.  For example, it is entirely
   acceptable to have the first two requests on IKE Main Mode come over
   UDP port 500, while the last request comes over TCP, and the

   following Quick Mode request might come over UDP port 4500 (because
   NAT has been detected).

   A responder that receives an IKEv2 Initial request over any other
   transport MUST send an IKE_TCP_SUPPORTED notification (Section 2.5)
   in the Initial response. the responder MAY send this notification
   even if the Initial request was received over TCP.

   If the responder has some requests of its own to send, it MUST NOT
   use a connection that has been opened by a peer.  Instead, it MUST
   either use UDP or else open a new TCP connection to the original
   Initiator's TCP port 500.

   The normal flow of things is that the Initiator opens a connection
   and closes its side first.  The responder closes after sending the
   last response where the initiator has already half-closed the
   connection.  If, however, a significant amount of time has passed,
   and neither new requests arrive nor the connection is closed by the
   initiator, the Responder MAY close or even reset the connection.

   This specification makes no recommendation as to how long such a
   timeout should be, but a few seconds should be enough.

2.3.  Transmitter

   The transmitter, whether an initiator transmitting a request or a
   responder transmitting a response MUST NOT retransmit over the same
   connection.  TCP takes care of that.  It SHOULD send the IKE header
   and the IKE payloads with a single command or in rapid succession,
   because the receiver might block on reading from the socket.

2.4.  Receiver

   The IKE header is copied from RFC 5996 below for reference:

                       Figure 1:  IKE Header Format

   The receiver MUST first read in the 28 bytes that make up the IKE
   header.  The Responder then subtracts 28 from the length field, and
   reads the resulting number of bytes.  The combined message, comprised
   on 28 header bytes and whatever number of payload bytes is processed
   the same way as regular UDP messages.  That includes retransmission
   detection, with one slight difference: if a retransmitted request is
   detected, the response is retransmitted as well, but using the
   current TCP connection rather than whatever other transport had been
   used for the original transmission of the request.

2.5.  IKE_TCP_SUPPORTED Notification

   This notification is sent by a responder over non-TCP transports to
   inform the initiator that this specification is supported.

   The Notify payload is formatted as follows:

                            1                   2                   3

3.  Operational Considerations

   Most IKE messages are relatively short.  Quick Mode in IKEv1, and all
   but the IKE_AUTH exchange in IKEv2 are comprised of short messages
   that fit in a single packet on most networks.  It is only the
   IKE_AUTH exchange in IKEv2, and the two last messages of Main Mode
   that are long.  UDP has advantages in lower latency and lower
   resource consumption, so it makes sense to use UDP whenever TCP is
   not required.

   The requirements in Section 2.2 mean that different requests may be
   sent over different transports.  So the initiator can choose the
   transport on a per-request basis.  So one obvious policy would be to
   do everything over UDP except the specific requests that tend to
   become too big.  This way the first messages use UDP, and the
   Initiator can set up the TCP connection at the same time, eliminating
   the latency penalty of using TCP.  This may not always be the most
   efficient policy, though.  It means that the first messages sent over
   TCP are relatively large ones, and TCP slow start may cause an extra
   roundtrip, because the message may exceed the transmission window.
   An initiator using this policy MUST NOT go to TCP if the responder
   has not indicated support by sending the IKE_TCP_SUPPORTED
   notification (Section 2.5) in the Initial response.

   An alternative method, that is probably easier for the Initiator to
   implement, is to do an entire "mission" using the same transport.  So
   if TCP is needed and an IKE SA has not yet been created, the
   Initiator will open a TCP connection, and perform all 2-4 requests
   needed to set up a child SA over the same connection.

   Yet another policy would be to begin by using UDP, and at the same
   time set up the TCP connection.  If at any point the TCP handshake
   completes, the next requests go over that connection.  This method
   can be used to auto-discover support of TCP on the responder.  This
   is easier for the user than configuring which peers support TCP, but
   has the potential of wasting resources, as TCP connections may finish
   the three-way handshake just when IKE over UDP has finished.  The
   requirements from the responder ensure that all these policies will
   work.

3.1.  Liveness Check

   The TCP connections described in this document are short-lived.  We
   do not expect them to stay for the lifetime of the SA, but to get

   torn down by either side within seconds of the SA being set up.
   Because of this, they are not well-suited for the transport of short
   requests such as those for liveness check.

   Although liveness checks MAY be sent over TCP, this is not
   recommended.


4.  Security Considerations

   Most of the security considerations for IKE over TCP are the same as
   those for UDP as in RFC 5996.

   For the Responder, listening to TCP port 500 involves all the risks
   of maintaining any TCP server.  Precautions against DoS attacks, such
   as SYN cookies are RECOMMENDED.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a notify message type from the status
   types range (16418-40959) of the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types"
   registry with name "IKE_TCP_SUPPORTED"

   No IANA action is required for the TCP port, as TCP port 500 is
   already allocated to "ISAKMP".
