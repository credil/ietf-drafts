<abstract>

<t>This text describes evolving networking technology within
residential home networks with increasing numbers of devices and
a trend towards increased internal routing.  The goal of this 
document is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based home 
networking, describing the associated principles, considerations and 
requirements. The text briefly highlights specific implications 
of the introduction of IPv6 for home networking, discusses the 
elements of the architecture, and suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms 
and addressing can be employed in home networking. The architecture 
describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain 
additional functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home network 
is not actively managed, and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack network. 
There are no recommendations in this text for the IPv4 part of the network.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>This document focuses on evolving networking technology within
residential home networks with increasing numbers of devices and
a trend towards increased internal routing, and the associated 
challenges with their deployment and operation. There
is a growing trend in home networking for the proliferation of networking
technology through an increasingly broad range of devices and media. This
evolution in scale and diversity sets requirements on IETF protocols. 
Some of these requirements relate to the introduction of IPv6, others
to the introduction of specialised networks for home automation and
sensors.</t>

<t>
While at the time of writing
some complex home network topologies exist, most are relatively simple
single subnet networks, and ostensibly operate using just IPv4. While
there may be IPv6 traffic within the network, e.g., for service discovery,
the homenet is provisioned by the ISP as an IPv4 network. Such networks
also typically employ solutions that should be avoided, such as
private <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> addressing with (cascaded)
network address translation (NAT) <xref target="RFC3022"></xref>,
or they may require expert assistance to set up.
</t>
<t>
In contrast, emerging IPv6-capable home networks are very likely to have
multiple internal subnets, e.g., to facilitate private and guest
networks, heterogeneous link layers, and smart grid components, and have
enough address space available to allow every device to have a globally
unique address. This implies that internal routing functionality is required,
and that the homenet's ISP both provides a large enough prefix to allocate
a prefix to each subnet, and that a method is supported for such prefixes
to be delegated efficiently to those subnets.
</t>
<t>
It is not practical to expect home users to configure their networks.
Thus the assumption of this document is that the
homenet is as far as possible self-organising and self-configuring, i.e.,
it should function without pro-active management by the residential user.
</t>

<t>The
architectural constructs in this document are focused on the problems
to be solved when introducing IPv6, with an eye towards a better result
than what we have today with IPv4, as well as aiming at a more consistent 
solution that addresses as many of the identified requirements as 
possible.
The document aims to provide the basis and guiding principles for how
standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing <xref target="RFC2460"/> <xref
target="RFC4291"/> can be employed in home networking, while
coexisting with existing IPv4 mechanisms.  In emerging dual-stack 
home networks it is vital that introducing IPv6 does not adversely 
affect IPv4 operation.  We assume that the IPv4 network 
architecture in home networks is what it is, and can not be modified by 
new recommendations. This document does not discuss how IPv4 home networks
provision or deliver support for multiple subnets.
It should not be assumed that any future new functionality created with 
IPv6 in mind will be backward-compatible to include IPv4 support.
Further, future deployments, or specific subnets within 
an otherwise dual-stack home network, may be IPv6-only, in which
case considerations for IPv4 impact would not apply.
</t>

<t>
This document proposes a baseline homenet architecture, using 
protocols and implementations that are as far as possible proven and 
robust.
The scope of the document is primarily the network layer technologies
that provide the basic functionality to enable addressing, connectivity, 
routing, naming and service discovery.  While it may, for example, 
state that homenet components must be simple to deploy and use, it does
not discuss specific user interfaces, nor does it discuss specific
physical, wireless or data-link layer considerations.
</t>

<t>
<xref target="RFC6204"/>
defines basic requirements for customer edge routers (CERs). This document
has recently been updated with the definition of requirements for
specific transition tools on the CER in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-6204bis"/>, specifically
DS-Lite <xref target="RFC6333"/> and 6rd <xref target="RFC5969"/>. 
Such detailed specification of CER devices is considered out of scope of this
architecture document, and we assume that any required update of the CER
device specification as a result of adopting this architecture will be
handled as separate and specific updates to these existing documents.
Further, the scope of this text is the internal homenet, and thus
specific features on the WAN side of the CER are out of scope for this text.

<section anchor="trends" title="Effects of IPv6 on Home Networking">

<t>
While IPv6 resembles IPv4 in many ways, there are some notable differences
in the way it may typically be deployed.  It changes address allocation 
principles, 
making multi-addressing the norm, and, through the vastly increased address
space, allows globally unique IP addresses to be used for all devices
in a home network.  This section presents an overview 
of some of the key implications of the introduction of IPv6 for home 
networking, that are simultaneously both promising and problematic.
</t>

<section title="Multiple subnets and routers">
<t>
While simple layer 3 topologies involving as few subnets as possible 
are preferred in home networks, the incorporation of dedicated (routed) 
subnets remains necessary for a variety of reasons. 
For instance, an increasingly common feature in modern home routers 
is the ability to support both guest and private network subnets. 
Likewise, there may be a need to
separate home automation or corporate extension LANs (whereby a home 
worker can have their corporate network extended into the home using
a virtual private network, commonly presented as one port on an 
Ethernet device) from the main Internet 
access network, or different subnets may in general 
be associated with parts of the
homenet that have different routing and security policies. Further,
link layer networking technology is poised to become more heterogeneous, 
as networks begin to employ both traditional Ethernet technology and link
layers designed for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), such as those
used for certain types of sensor devices. Constraining the flow of
certain traffic from Ethernet links to much lower capacity links
thus becomes an important topic.
</t>
<t>
The introduction of IPv6 for home networking makes it possible
for every home network to be delegated enough address space
from its ISP 
to provision globally unique prefixes for each such subnet in the home. 
While the number of addresses in a standard /64 IPv6 prefix 
is practically unlimited, the number of prefixes available for assignment 
to the home network is not. As a result the growth inhibitor for the 
home network shifts from the number of addresses to the number of prefixes 
offered by the provider; this topic is discussed in <xref target="RFC6177"/>
(BCP 157),
which recommends that "end sites always be able to obtain a reasonable 
amount of address space for their actual and planned usage".
</t>

<t>The addition of routing between subnets raises a number of issues.
One is a method by which prefixes can be efficiently allocated to each
subnet, without user intervention.  Another is the issue of 
how to extend mechanisms such as zero configuration
service discovery which currently only
operate within a single subnet using link-local traffic.  In a typical
IPv4 home network, there is only one subnet, so such mechanisms would
normally operate as expected.  For multi-subnet IPv6 home networks
there are two broad choices to enable such protocols to work across
the scope of the entire homenet;
extend existing protocols to work across that scope, or
introduce proxies for existing link layer protocols.  This topic is 
discussed in <xref target="naming-sd"/>.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Global addressability and elimination of NAT">
 
<t>
The possibility for direct end-to-end communication on the Internet to
be restored by the introduction of IPv6 is
on the one hand an incredible 
opportunity for innovation and simpler network operation,
but on the other hand it is 
also a concern as it potentially exposes nodes in the internal
networks to receipt of unwanted and possibly malicious 
traffic from the Internet.  
</t>
<t>
With devices and applications able to talk directly to
each other when they have globally unique addresses, there may 
be an expectation of improved host security to compensate for this.
It should be noted that many devices may (for
example) ship with default settings that make them readily vulnerable
to compromise by external attackers if globally accessible, or may simply
not have robustness designed-in because it was either assumed such devices
would only be used on private networks or the device itself doesn't
have the computing power to apply the necessary security methods.
In addition, the upgrade cycle for devices (or their firmware) may be slow, 
and/or lack auto-update mechanisms.
</t>
<t>
It is thus important to distinguish between addressability and reachability.
While IPv6 offers global addressability through use of globally 
unique addresses in the home, whether devices are globally reachable or
not would depend on any firewall or filtering configuration, and not,
as is commonly the case with IPv4, the presence or use of NAT.
In this respect, IPv6 networks may or may not have filters applied at 
their borders to control such traffic, i.e., at the homenet CER.
<xref target="RFC4864"></xref> and <xref target="RFC6092"></xref>
discuss such filtering, and the merits of 'default allow' against
'default deny' policies for external traffic initiated into a homenet.
This document takes no position on which mode is the default, but 
assumes the choice for the homenet to use either mode would be available.
</t>
<t>
This topic is discussed further in <xref target="addressability"></xref>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Multi-Addressing of devices">

<t>
In an IPv6 network, devices will often acquire multiple addresses, typically
at least a link-local address and one or more globally unique addresses. 
Where a homenet is multihomed, a device would typically receive a globally
unique address (GUA) from within the delegated prefix from each upstream ISP.
Devices may also have an IPv4 address if the network is dual-stack, an
IPv6 Unique Local Address (ULA) <xref target="RFC4193"></xref> (see below),
and one or more IPv6 Privacy Addresses <xref target="RFC4941"></xref>.
</t>
<t>
It should thus be considered the norm for devices on IPv6 home networks 
to be multi-addressed, and to need to make appropriate address selection
decisions for the candidate source and destination address pairs for any
given connection.  Default Address Selection for IPv6 
<xref target="RFC6724"></xref> 
provides a solution for this, though it may face problems in the event 
of multihoming where, as described above, nodes
will be configured with one address from each upstream ISP prefix.
In such cases the presence of upstream BCP 38 
<xref target="RFC2827"></xref> 
ingress filtering requires 
multi-addressed nodes to select the correct source address to be used 
for the corresponding uplink. A challenge here is that the node may 
not have the information it needs to make that decision based on addresses 
alone.  We discuss this challenge in <xref target="multihoming"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Unique Local Addresses (ULAs)">

<t>
<xref target="RFC4193"></xref> defines Unique Local Addresses (ULAs)
for IPv6 that may be used to address devices within the scope of a
single site. Support for ULAs for IPv6 CERs is described in <xref
target="RFC6204"></xref>.  A home network running IPv6 should deploy ULAs
alongside its globally unique prefix(es) to allow stable communication 
between devices (on different subnets) within the homenet
where that externally allocated globally unique prefix may change over 
time, e.g., due to renumbering within the subscriber's ISP, or where 
external connectivity may be temporarily unavailable. A homenet using
provider-assigned global addresses is exposed to its ISP renumbering the 
network to a much larger degree than before whereas, for IPv4, NAT 
isolated the user against ISP renumbering to some extent.
</t>
<t>
While setting up a network there may be a period where it has no 
external connectivity, in which case ULAs would be required for 
inter-subnet communication.  In the case where home automation
networks are
being set up in a new home/deployment (as early as during
construction of the home), such networks 
will likely need to use their own /48
ULA prefix.  Depending upon circumstances beyond the control of the owner
of the homenet, it may be impossible to renumber the ULA used by the home
automation network
so routing between ULA /48s may be required.  Also, some
devices, particularly constrained devices, may have only a ULA (in addition 
to a link-local), while others may have both a GUA and a ULA.
</t>
<t>
Note that unlike private IPv4 RFC 1918 space, the use of ULAs does not 
imply use of an IPv6 equivalent of a traditional IPv4 NAT 
<xref target="RFC3022" />, or of NPTv6 prefix-based NAT 
<xref target="RFC6296"/>. When an IPv6 node in a homenet has both a ULA and
a globally unique IPv6 address, it should only use its 
ULA address internally, and use its additional globally unique IPv6 address
as a source address for external communications.  This should be the natural
behaviour given support for Default Address Selection for
IPv6 <xref target="RFC6724"></xref>.  By using
such globally unique addresses between hosts and devices in remote networks, 
the architectural cost and complexity, particularly to applications,
of NAT or NPTv6 translation is avoided. As such, neither
IPv6 NAT or NPTv6 is recommended for use in the homenet architecture.
Further, the homenet border router(s) should filter packets with ULA
source/destination addresses as discussed in <xref target="stableinternal"/>.
</t>
<t>
Devices in a homenet may be given only a ULA as a means to restrict
reachability from outside the homenet.  ULAs can be used by default for 
devices that, without additional configuration (e.g., via a web interface),
would only offer services to the internal network. For example,
a printer might only accept incoming connections on a ULA
until configured to be globally reachable, at which point it acquires
a global IPv6 address and may be advertised via a global name space.
</t>
<t>
Where both a ULA and a global prefix are in use, the
ULA source address is used to communicate with ULA destination addresses 
when appropriate, i.e., when the ULA source and destination lie within 
the /48 ULA prefix(es) known to be used within the same homenet.
In cases where multiple /48 ULA prefixes are in use within a single homenet
(perhaps because multiple homenet routers each independently
auto-generate a /48 ULA prefix and then share prefix/routing information),
utilising a ULA source address and a ULA destination address from two
disjoint internal ULA prefixes is preferable to using GUAs.
</t>
<t>
While a homenet should operate correctly with two or more /48 ULAs 
enabled, a mechanism for the creation and use of a single /48 
ULA prefix is desirable for addressing consistency and policy enforcement.  
</t>
<t>
A counter-argument to using ULAs is that it is undesirable to aggressively 
deprecate global prefixes for temporary loss of connectivity, so for a
host to lose its global address there would have to be a connection 
breakage longer than the lease period, and even then, deprecating prefixes 
when there is no connectivity may not be advisable.  However, it is 
assumed in this architecture that homenets should support and use ULAs.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Avoiding manual configuration of IP addresses">

<t>
Some IPv4 home networking devices expose IPv4 addresses to users, e.g.,
the IPv4 address of a home IPv4 CER that may be configured via a web
interface.  In potentially complex future IPv6 homenets, users should not 
be expected to enter IPv6 literal addresses in devices or applications, 
given their much greater length and the apparent randomness of such addresses 
to a typical home user.  Thus, even for the simplest of functions, simple
naming and the associated (minimal, and ideally zero configuration) 
discovery of services is imperative for the easy deployment and use of 
homenet devices and applications. 
</t>
</section>


<section title="IPv6-only operation">
<t> 
It is likely that IPv6-only networking will be deployed first in new 
home network deployments, often refered to as 'greenfield' scenarios,
where there is no existing IPv4 capability,
or perhaps as one element of an otherwise dual-stack network.  
Running IPv6-only adds additional requirements, e.g., for devices to get 
configuration information via IPv6 transport (not relying on an IPv4
protocol such as IPv4 DHCP), and for devices to be able to
initiate communications to external devices that are IPv4-only.
</t>
<t>
Some specific transition technologies which may be deployed by the
homenet's ISP are discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-6204bis"/>.
In addition, certain other functions may be desirable on the CER,
e.g., to access content in the IPv4 Internet,
<xref target="RFC6144">NAT64</xref> and 
<xref target="RFC6145">DNS64</xref> may be applicable.
</t>
<t>
The widespread availability of robust solutions to these types of
requirements will help accelerate the uptake of IPv6-only homenets.
The specifics of these are however beyond the scope of this document,
especially those functions that reside on the CER.
</t>

<section anchor="arch" title="Homenet Architecture Principles">

<t>
The aim of this text is to outline how to construct advanced IPv6-
based home networks involving multiple routers and subnets using
standard IPv6 addressing and protocols <xref target="RFC2460"/> <xref
target="RFC4291"/> as the basis. As described in <xref target="generalp"></xref>, 
solutions should as far as possible
re-use existing protocols, and minimise changes to hosts and 
routers, but some new protocols, or extensions, are likely to
be required.  In this section, we present the elements
of the proposed home networking architecture, with discussion of the
associated design principles.
</t>

<t>
In general, home network equipment needs to be able to operate in
networks with a range of different properties and topologies,
where home users may plug components together in arbitrary ways and
expect the resulting network to operate.
Significant manual configuration is rarely, if at all, possible, or 
even desirable given the knowledge level of typical home users. 
Thus the network should, as far as possible, be self-configuring, though
configuration by advanced users should not be precluded.
</t>
<t>
The homenet needs to be able to handle or provision at least
<list style="symbols">
<t>Routing</t>
<t>Prefix configuration for routers</t>
<t>Name resolution</t>
<t>Service discovery</t>
<t>Network security</t>
</list></t>
<t>
The remainder of this document describes the principles by which the
homenet architecture may deliver these properties.
</t>

<section anchor="generalp" title="General Principles">

<t>There is little that the Internet standards community can do about
the physical topologies or the need for some networks to be separated
at the network layer for policy or link layer compatibility reasons.
However, there is a lot of flexibility in using IP addressing and
inter-networking mechanisms. This text discusses
how such flexibility should be used to provide the best 
user experience and ensure that the network can evolve with new
applications in the future.  The principles described in this text
should be followed when designing homenet protocol
solutions. </t>

<section title="Reuse existing protocols">
<t>
It is desirable to reuse existing protocols where possible, but at
the same time to avoid consciously precluding the introduction of new or 
emerging protocols.  
A generally conservative approach, giving weight to running (and
available) code, is preferable. Where new protocols are required, evidence 
of commitment to
implementation by appropriate vendors or development communities is
highly desirable.  Protocols used should be backwardly compatible,
and forward compatible where changes are made.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Minimise changes to hosts and routers">
<t>
In order to maximise deployability of new homenets, where possible
any requirement for changes to hosts and routers should be minimised, 
though solutions which, for example, incrementally improve capability 
with host or router changes may be acceptable. There may be cases
where changes are unavoidable, e.g., to allow a given homenet routing
protocol to be self-configuring.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Homenet Topology">

<t>
This section considers homenet topologies, and the principles
that may be applied in designing an architecture to support as wide a range
of such topologies as possible.
</t>

<section title="Supporting arbitrary topologies">
<t>
There should ideally be no built-in assumptions about the topology in home
networks, as users are capable of connecting their devices in
'ingenious' ways. Thus arbitrary topologies and arbitrary routing
will need to be supported,
or at least the failure mode for when the user makes a mistake should
be as robust as possible, e.g., de-activating a certain part of the
infrastructure to allow the rest to operate. In such cases, 
the user should ideally have some useful 
indication of the failure mode encountered.</t>

<t>There should be no topology scenarios which cause loss of
connectivity, except when the user
creates a physical island within the topology.  Some potentially
pathological cases that can be created include bridging ports of a
router together, however this case can be detected and dealt with by
the router.  Loops within a routed topology are in a sense good in
that they offer redundancy.  Bridging loops can be dangerous but are
also detectable when a switch learns the MAC of one of its interfaces
on another or runs a spanning tree or link state protocol.  
It is only loops using simple repeaters that are truly pathological.</t>

<t>
The topology of the homenet may change over time, due to the addition
or removal of equipment, but also due to temporary failures or
connectivity problems.  In some cases this may lead to, for example,
a multihomed homenet being split into two isolated homenets, or, 
after such a fault is remedied, two isolated parts reconfiguring back
to a single network.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Network topology models">

<t>
Most IPv4 home network models at the time of writing tend 
to be relatively simple,
typically a single NAT router to the ISP and a single internal
subnet but, as discussed earlier, evolution in network architectures
is driving more complex topologies, such as the separation of guest
and private networks. There may also be some cascaded IPv4 NAT
scenarios, which we mention in the next section.  For IPv6 homenets, 
the Network Architectures described in <xref target="RFC6204"/> 
and its successor <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-6204bis"/> 
should, as a minimum, be supported.
</t>
<t>
There are a number of properties or attributes of a home network that 
we can use to describe its topology and operation.
The following properties apply to any IPv6 home network:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Presence of internal routers.  The homenet may have one or more internal
routers, or may only provide subnetting from interfaces on the CER.</t>
<t>Presence of isolated internal subnets. There may be isolated internal 
subnets, with no direct connectivity between them within the homenet 
(with each having its own external connectivity).  Isolation may
be physical, or implemented via IEEE 802.1q VLANs. The latter is however
not something a typical user would be expected to configure.</t>
<t>Demarcation of the CER.  The CER(s) may or may not be managed by
the ISP.  If the demarcation point is such that the customer
can provide or manage the CER, its configuration must be simple.  Both
models must be supported.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Various forms of multihoming are likely to become more prevalent with 
IPv6 home networks, where the homenet may have two or more external ISP
connections, as discussed further below. 
Thus the following properties should also be considered for such networks:
</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Number of upstream providers.  The majority of home networks today 
consist of a single upstream ISP, but it may become more common 
in the future for there to be multiple ISPs, whether for resilience 
or provision of additional services.  
Each would offer its own prefix.  Some may or may not provide
a default route to the public Internet.  </t>
<t>Number of CERs. The homenet may have a single CER, which might be
used for one or more providers, or multiple CERs.  The presence
of multiple CERs adds
additional complexity for multihoming scenarios, and protocols like
PCP that may need to manage connection-oriented state mappings on
the same CER as used for subsequent traffic flows.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
In the following sections we give some examples of the types of 
homenet topologies we may see in the future.  This is not 
intended to be
an exhaustive or complete list, rather an indicative one to
facilitate the discussion in this text.
</t>

<section title="A: Single ISP, Single CER, Internal routers">

<t>Figure 1 shows a home network with multiple local area networks. These 
may be needed for reasons relating to different link layer technologies 
in use or for policy reasons, e.g.,  classic Ethernet in one subnet and 
a LLN link layer technology in another.  In this example there is no 
single router that a priori understands the entire topology.  The 
topology itself may also be complex, and it may not be possible to 
assume a pure tree form, for instance (because home
users may plug routers together to form arbitrary topologies 
including loops).</t>

In this diagram there is one CER.  It has a single uplink interface.
It has three additional interfaces connected to
Network A, Link F, and Network B.  IPv6 Internal Router (IR) has four
interfaces connected to Link F, Network C, Network D and Network E.
Network B and Network E have been bridged, likely inadvertently. This
could be as a result of connecting a wire between a switch for Network B
and a switch for Network E.
</t>

<t>
Any of logical Networks A through F might be wired or wireless. 
Where multiple hosts are shown, this might be through one or more
physical ports on the CER or IPv6 (IR), wireless networks, or through
one or more layer-2 only Ethernet switches.

Figure 2 illustrates a multihomed homenet model, where the
customer has connectivity via CER1 to ISP A and via CER2 to ISP B.
This example shows one shared subnet where IPv6 nodes would
potentially be multihomed and receive multiple IPv6 global
prefixes, one per ISP.  This model may also be combined with
that shown in Figure 1 to create a more complex scenario with multiple 
internal routers.  Or the above shared subnet may be split in two, 
such that each CER serves a separate isolated subnet, which is a 
scenario seen with some IPv4 networks today.

Figure 3 illustrates a model where a home network may have multiple
connections to multiple providers or multiple logical connections to 
the same provider, with shared internal subnets.  
</t>
<t>
In general, while the architecture may focus on likely common
topologies, it should not preclude any arbitrary topology from 
being constructed.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section title="Dual-stack topologies">
<t>
It is expected that most homenet deployments will for the immediate
future be dual-stack IPv4/IPv6. In such networks
it is important not to introduce new IPv6 capabilities that would cause
a failure if used alongside IPv4+NAT, given that such 
dual-stack homenets will be commonplace for some time.
That said, it is desirable that IPv6 works better than IPv4 in 
as many scenarios as possible. Further, the homenet architecture must 
operate in the absence of IPv4.  
</t>
<t>
A general recommendation is to follow the same topology for IPv6
as is used for IPv4, but not to use NAT. Thus there should be 
routed IPv6 where an IPv4 NAT is used and, where there is no NAT,
routing or bridging may be used.  Routing may have advantages when
compared to bridging together high speed and lower speed shared media, 
and in addition bridging
may not be suitable for some networks, such as ad-hoc mobile networks.
</t>
<t>
In some cases IPv4 home networks may feature cascaded NATs.
End users are frequently unaware that they have created such
networks as 'home routers' and 'home switches' are frequently
confused. In addition, there are cases where
NAT routers are included within Virtual Machine Hypervisors, or
where Internet connection sharing services have been enabled.
This document applies equally to such hidden NAT 'routers'.
IPv6 routed versions of such cases will be required.
We should thus also note that routers in the homenet may not be 
separate physical devices; they may be embedded within other devices.
</t>

</section>


<section anchor="multihoming" title="Multihoming">
<t>
A homenet may be multihomed to multiple providers, as the network
models above illustrate.  This may either
take a form where there are multiple isolated networks within the home 
or a more integrated network where the connectivity selection 
needs to be dynamic.
Current practice is typically of the former kind, but the latter is
expected to become more commonplace.
</t> 

<t>
In the general homenet architecture, multihomed hosts should be 
multi-addressed with a global IPv6 address from the global prefix delegated
from each ISP they communicate with or through. 
When such multi-addressing is in use, hosts need some way to pick source
and destination address pairs for connections.
A host may choose a source address to use by various methods, most
commonly <xref target="RFC6724"/>.  Applications may
of course do different things, and this should not be precluded. 
</t>

<t>
For the single CER Network Model C illustrated above, multihoming may 
be offered by source-based routing at the CER. With multiple exit routers, 
as in CER Network Model B, the complexity rises.
Given a packet with a source address on the home network, the
packet must be routed to the proper egress to avoid BCP 38 ingress
filtering if exiting through the wrong ISP.  It is highly desirable 
that the packet is routed in the most efficient manner to the correct exit,
though as a minimum requirement the packet should not be dropped.  
</t>

<t>
The homenet architecture should support both the above models, i.e., one or
more CERs. However,
the general multihoming problem is broad, and solutions suggested to
date within the IETF have
included complex architectures for monitoring connectivity,
traffic engineering, identifier-locator separation, connection survivability
across multihoming events, and so on.  It is thus important that
the homenet architecture should as far as possible
minimise the complexity of any multihoming support.
</t>

<t>
An example of such a 'simpler' approach has been documented 
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-multihoming-without-ipv6nat"/>.
Alternatively a flooding/routing protocol could potentially be
used to pass information through the homenet, such that internal
routers and ultimately end hosts could learn per-prefix configuration
information, allowing better address selection decisions to be made.
However, this would imply router and, most likely, host changes.
Another avenue is to introduce support throughout the homenet for 
routing which is based on the source as well as the destination 
address of each packet.
While greatly improving the 'intelligence' of
routing decisions within the homenet, such an approach would require 
relatively significant router changes but avoid host changes.
</t>

<t>
As explained previously, while NPTv6 has been proposed for providing
multi-homing support in networks, its use is not recommended in the homenet
architecture.
</t>

<t>It should be noted that some multihoming scenarios may see one
upstream being a "walled garden", and thus only appropriate for 
connectivity to the services of that provider; an example may be
a VPN service that only routes back to the enterprise business
network of a user in the homenet.
As per <xref target="RFC3002"></xref> (section 4.2.1) we do not
specifically target walled garden multihoming as a goal
of this document.
</t>

<t>
The homenet architecture should also not preclude use of host or
application-oriented tools, e.g., Shim6 <xref target="RFC5533"/>,
MPTCP <xref target="RFC6824"/> or
<xref target="RFC6555">Happy Eyeballs</xref>. In general, any incremental
improvements obtained by host changes should give benefit for the
hosts introducing them, but not be required.
</t>

</section>

</section>


<section title="A Self-Organising Network">

<t>
The home network infrastructure
should be naturally self-organising and self-configuring
under different circumstances relating to the connectivity status to the
Internet, number of devices, and physical topology.
At the same time, it should be possible for advanced users to
manually adjust (override) the current configuration. </t>
<t>
While a goal of the homenet architecture is for the network to be as 
self-organising as possible, there may be instances where some manual
configuration is required, e.g., the entry of a cryptographic key to 
apply wireless
security, or to configure a shared routing secret. The latter may be
relevant when considering how to bootstrap a routing configuration.
It is highly desirable that the number of such configurations is minimised.
</t>

<section title="Differentiating neighbouring homenets">
<t>
It is important that self-configuration with 'unintended' devices
is avoided. 
There should be a way for a user to administratively assert in a simple
way whether or not a device belongs to a homenet. The goal is to allow 
the establishment of borders, particularly between two adjacent homenets,
and to avoid unauthorised devices from participating in 
the homenet. Such an authorisation capability may need to operate through
multiple hops in the homenet.
</t>
<t>
The homenet should thus support a way for a homenet owner to 
claim ownership of their devices in a reasonably secure way. This could be 
achieved by a pairing mechanism, by for example pressing buttons 
simultaneously on an authenticated and a new homenet device, or by an 
enrolment process as part of an autonomic networking environment.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Largest practical subnets">
<t>
Today's IPv4 home networks generally have a single subnet, and
early dual-stack deployments have a single congruent IPv6 subnet,
possibly with some bridging functionality.  More recently,
some vendors have
started to introduce 'home' and 'guest' functions, which in IPv6
would be implemented as two subnets.
</t>
<t> 
Future home networks are highly likely to have one or more internal
routers and thus need multiple subnets, for 
the reasons described earlier.  As part
of the self-organisation of the network, the homenet should subdivide
itself into the largest practical subnets that can be constructed within
the constraints of link layer mechanisms, bridging, physical
connectivity, and policy, and where applicable performance or other
criteria. In such subdivisions the logical topology may not necessarily 
match the physical
topology. This text does not, however, make recommendations on how such
subdivision should occur. It is expected that subsequent documents will
address this problem.
</t>
<t>
While it may be desirable to maximise the chance of link-local
protocols operating across a homenet by maximising the size of a subnet,
multi-subnet home networks are inevitable, so their support must be 
included. 
</t>

</section>

<section title="Handling varying link technologies">

<t>
Homenets tend to grow organically over many years, and a homenet
will typically be built over link-layer technologies from different
generations.  Current homenets typically use links ranging from
1Mbit/s up to 1Gbit/s, which is a three orders of magnitude throughput
discrepancy.  We expect this discrepancy to widen further as both
high-speed and low-power technologies are deployed. 
</t>

<t>
Homenet protocols should be designed to deal well with interconnecting 
links of very different throughputs.  In particular, flows local to a 
link should 
not be flooded throughout the homenet, even when sent over multicast, 
and, whenever possible, the homenet protocols should be able to choose the 
faster links and avoid the slower ones.
</t>

<t>
Links (particularly wireless links) may also have limited numbers of 
transmit opportunities (txops), and there is a clear trend driven by 
both power and downward compatibility constraints toward aggregation of 
packets into these limited txops while increasing throughput.
Transmit opportunities may be a system's scarcest resource and therefore 
also strongly limit actual throughput available.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Homenet realms and borders">

<t>
The homenet will need to be aware of the extent of its own 'site',
which will, for example, define the borders for ULA and site 
scope multicast traffic, and may require specific security policies to 
be applied.
The homenet will have one or more such borders with external 
connectivity providers.
</t>
<t> 
A homenet will most likely also have internal borders between internal 
realms, e.g., a guest realm or a corporate network extension realm. It 
should be possible to automatically discover these borders, which will 
determine, for example, the scope of where network prefixes, routing 
information, network traffic, service discovery and naming may be shared. 
The default mode internally should be to share everything.
</t>
<t>
It is expected that a realm would span at least an entire subnet, and thus
the borders lie at routers which receive delegated prefixes within the 
homenet.  It is also desirable, for a richer security model, that hosts
are able to 
make communication decisions based on available realm and associated 
prefix information in the same way that routers at realm borders can.
</t>
<t>
A simple homenet model may just consider three types of realm and
the borders between them, namely the internal homenet, the ISP and a 
guest network. In this case
the borders will include that from the homenet to the ISP, that 
from the guest network to the ISP, and that from the homenet to 
the guest network.  Regardless, it should be possible
for additional types of realms and borders to be defined, e.g., for some 
specific LLN-based network, such as Smart Grid, and for these to be detected 
automatically, and for an appropriate default policy to be applied 
as to what type of traffic/data can flow across such borders.
</t>
<t>
It is desirable to classify the external border of the home network as a 
unique logical interface separating the home network from service provider
network/s. This border interface may be a single physical interface to 
a single service provider, multiple layer 2 sub-interfaces to a single 
service provider, or multiple connections to a single or multiple providers. 
This border makes it possible to describe edge operations and interface 
requirements across multiple functional areas including security, routing,
service discovery, and router discovery.  
</t>
<t>
It should be possible for the homenet user to override any automatically
determined borders and the default policies applied between them, the
exception being that it may not be possible to override policies defined by
the ISP at the external border.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Configuration information from the ISP">

<t>
In certain cases, it may be useful for the homenet to get certain configuration
information from its ISP. For example, the homenet DHCP server may request and 
forward some options that it gets from its upstream DHCP server, though the
specific of the options may vary across deployments. There is potential
complexity here of course should the homenet be multihomed.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Homenet Addressing">

<t>
The IPv6 addressing scheme used within a homenet must conform to
the IPv6 addressing architecture <xref target="RFC4291"/>. In this
section we discuss how the homenet needs to adapt to the prefixes made 
available to it by its upstream ISP, such that internal subnets, hosts 
and devices can obtain the and configure the necessary addressing information 
to operate.
</t>

<section title="Use of ISP-delegated IPv6 prefixes">
<t>
Discussion of IPv6 prefix allocation policies is included in
<xref target="RFC6177"></xref>.  In practice, 
a homenet may receive an arbitrary length IPv6 prefix from
its provider, e.g., /60, /56 or /48. The offered prefix may be stable
or change from time to time; it is generally expected that ISPs will
offer relatively stable prefixes to their residential customers.
Regardless, the home network needs to be adaptable as far as
possible to ISP prefix 
allocation policies, and thus make no assumptions about the 
stability of the prefix received from an ISP, or the length of the 
prefix that may be offered.
</t>
<t>
However, if, for example, only a /64 is offered by the ISP, the homenet may 
be severely constrained or even unable to function.  <xref target="RFC6177"/> 
(BCP 157) states that "a key principle for address management is that 
end sites always be able to obtain a reasonable amount of address 
space for their actual and planned usage, and over time ranges 
specified in years rather than just months.  In practice, 
that means at least one /64, and in most cases significantly more.  
One particular situation that must be avoided is having an end site feel
compelled to use IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Address Translation or other
burdensome address conservation techniques because it could not
get sufficient address space."  
This architecture document assumes that
the guidance in the quoted text is being followed by ISPs.
</t>
<t>
There are many problems that would arise from a homenet not being offered
a sufficient prefix size for its needs.
Rather than attempt to contrive a method for a homenet to operate in
a constrained manner when faced with insufficient prefixes, such as 
the use of subnet prefixes longer than /64 (which would break stateless
address autonfiguration <xref target="RFC4862"></xref>), use 
of NPTv6, or falling back to bridging across potentially very 
different media, it is recommended
that the receiving router instead enters an error state and issues appropriate
warnings. Some consideration may need to be given to how
such a warning or error state should best be presented to a typical home user.
</t>
<t>
Thus a homenet CER should request, for example via DHCP Prefix Delegation
(DHCP PD) <xref target="RFC3633"></xref>, that 
it would like a /48 prefix from its ISP, i.e., it asks the ISP for the 
maximum size prefix it might expect to be offered, even if in practice 
it may only be offered a /56 or /60.  For a typical IPv6
homenet, it is not recommended that an ISP offer less than a /60 prefix,
and it is highly preferable that the ISP offers 
at least a /56.  It is expected that the
allocated prefix to the homenet from any single ISP is a contiguous,
aggregated one. While it may be possible for a homenet CER to issue
multiple prefix requests to attempt to obtain multiple delegations, 
such behaviour is out of scope of this document.
</t>
<t>
The norm for residential customers of large ISPs may 
be similar to their single IPv4 address provision; by default it is likely
to remain persistent for some time, but changes in the ISP's own
provisioning systems may lead to the customer's IP (and in the IPv6 case
their prefix pool) changing. It is not expected that ISPs will generally
support Provider Independent (PI) addressing for residential homenets.
</t>
<t>
When an ISP does need to restructure, and in doing so renumber its customer 
homenets, 'flash' renumbering is likely to be imposed.  This implies a need 
for the homenet to be able to handle a sudden renumbering event which, unlike 
the process described in <xref target="RFC4192"></xref>, would be a 'flag day"
event, which means that a graceful renumbering process moving through a 
state with two active prefixes in use would not be possible. 
While renumbering can be viewed as
an extended version of an initial numbering process, the difference 
between flash renumbering and an initial 'cold start' is the need to 
provide service continuity.  
</t>
<t>
There may be cases where local law means some ISPs are required to change
IPv6 prefixes (current IPv4 addresses) for privacy reasons for their 
customers. In such cases it may be possible to avoid an instant 'flash'
renumbering and plan a non-flag day renumbering as per RFC 4192.
Similarly, if an ISP has a planned renumbering process, it may be able to
adjust lease timers, etc appropriately.
</t>
<t>
The customer may of course also choose to move
to a new ISP, and thus begin using a new prefix. In such cases the
customer should expect a discontinuity, and not only may the
prefix change, but potentially also the prefix length if the new ISP 
offers a different default size prefix.  The homenet may also be forced
to renumber itself if significant internal 'replumbing' is undertaken
by the user. Regardless, it's desirable that 
homenet protocols support rapid renumbering and that operational processes 
don't add unnecessary complexity for the renumbering process.  
Further, the introduction of any new homenet protocols should not make 
any form of renumbering any more complex than it already is.
</t>
<t>
Finally, the internal operation of the home network should also not depend 
on the availability of the ISP network at any given time, other than
of course for connectivity to services or systems off the home network. 
This reinforces the use of ULAs for stable internal communication, and the 
need for a naming and service discovery mechanism that can operate 
independently within the homenet.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="stableinternal" title="Stable internal IP addresses">
<t>
The network should by default attempt to 
provide IP-layer connectivity between all internal parts of
the homenet as well as to and from the external Internet, subject
to the filtering policies or other policy constraints 
discussed later in the security section.
</t>
<t>
ULAs should be used within the scope of a homenet to support stable 
routing and connectivity between subnets and hosts regardless of whether
a globally unique ISP-provided prefix is available.  In the case of a 
prolonged external connectivity outage, ULAs allow internal operations
across routed subnets to continue. ULA addresses also 
allow constrained devices to create permanent relationships between 
IPv6 addresses, e.g., from a wall controller to a lamp, where
symbolic host names would require additional non-volatile memory and
updating global prefixes in sleeping devices might also be problematic.
</t>
<t>
As discussed previously, it would be expected that ULAs would normally
be used alongside one or more global prefixes in a homenet, such that 
hosts become multi-addressed with both globally unique and ULA prefixes.
ULAs should be used for all devices, not just those intended to only have 
internal connectivity. 
Default address selection would then enable ULAs to be preferred for internal
communications between devices that are using ULA prefixes 
generated within the same homenet.
</t>
<t>
In cases where ULA prefixes are in use within a homenet but there is
no external IPv6 connectivity (and thus no GUAs in use), recommendations
ULA-5, L-3 and L-4 in RFC 6204 should be followed to ensure correct operation,
in particular where the homenet may be dual-stack with IPv4 external
connectivity. The use of the Route Information Option described in
<xref target="RFC4191"/> provides a mechanism to advertise such more-specific
ULA routes.
</t>
<t>
The use of ULAs should be restricted to the homenet scope through filtering 
at the border(s) of the homenet, as mandated by RFC 6204 requirement S-2.
</t>
<t>
Note that it is possible that in some cases multiple /48 ULA prefixes may
be in use within the same homenet, e.g., when the network is being deployed,
perhaps also without external connectivity. 
In cases where multiple ULA /48's are in use, hosts need
to know that each /48 is local to the homenet, e.g., by inclusion in their
local address selection policy table.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Internal prefix delegation">
<t>
As mentioned above, there are various sources of prefixes.
From the homenet perspective, a single global prefix from each ISP should
be received on the border CER <xref target="RFC3633"/>. 
Where multiple CERs exist with multiple ISP prefix pools, it is 
expected that routers within the homenet would assign themselves prefixes 
from each ISP they communicate with/through.
As discussed above, a ULA prefix should be provisioned for stable internal 
communications or for use on constrained/LLN networks.  
</t>

<t>The delegation or availability of a prefix pool to the homenet 
should allow subsequent
internal autonomous delegation of prefixes for use within the homenet. 
Such internal delegation should not assume a flat or
hierarchical model, nor should it make an assumption about whether the
delegation of internal prefixes is distributed or centralised.
The assignment mechanism should provide reasonable efficiency, so 
that typical home network prefix allocation sizes can accommodate all 
the necessary /64 allocations in most cases, and not waste prefixes. 
Further, duplicate assignment of multiple /64s to the same network 
should be avoided, and the network should behave as gracefully as possible 
in the event of prefix exhaustion (though the options in such cases may
be limited). 
</t>

<t>
Where the home network has multiple CERs and these are delegated prefix
pools from their attached ISPs, the internal prefix delegation would
be expected to be served by each CER for each prefix associated with it.
Where ULAs are used, it is preferable that only one /48 ULA
covers the whole homenet, from which /64's can be delegated to the subnets. 
In cases where two /48 ULAs are generated within a homenet, the
network should still continue to function, meaning that hosts will need   
to determine that each ULA is local to the homenet.</t>

<t> Delegation within the homenet should result in each link
being assigned a stable  prefix that is persistent across reboots, 
power outages and similar short-term outages.  The availability of
persistent prefixes should not depend on the router boot order. 
The addition of a new routing device should not affect existing persistent 
prefixes, but persistence may not be expected in the face of 
significant 'replumbing' of the homenet.  However,
delegated ULA prefixes within the homenet should remain persistent 
through an ISP-driven renumbering event. 
</t>
<t>
Provisioning such persistent prefixes may imply the need for stable storage 
on routing devices, and also a method for a home user to 'reset' the 
stored prefix should a significant reconfiguration be required (though 
ideally the home user should not be involved at all). 
</t>
<t>
This document makes no specific recommendation towards solutions, 
but notes that it is very likely that all routing devices 
participating in a homenet must use the same internal prefix delegation 
method. This implies that only one delegation method should be in use.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Coordination of configuration information">
<t>
The network elements will need to be integrated in a way that takes
account of the various lifetimes on timers that are used on 
different elements, e.g.,
DHCPv6 PD, router, valid prefix and preferred prefix timers.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Privacy">
<t>
If ISPs offer relatively stable IPv6 prefixes to customers, the network 
prefix part of addresses associated with the homenet may not change over 
a reasonably long period of time.  
</t>
<t>
The exposure of which traffic is sourced from the same homenet is thus 
similar to IPv4; the single IPv4 global address seen through use of IPv4 
NAT gives the same hint as the global IPv6 prefix seen for IPv6 traffic. 
</t>
<t>
While IPv4 NAT may obfuscate to an external observer which internal devices
traffic is sourced from, IPv6, even with use of Privacy Addresses
<xref target="RFC4941"></xref>, adds additional exposure of which 
traffic is sourced from the same internal device, through use of the same
IPv6 source address for a period of time.
</t>
</section>

</section>



<section title="Routing functionality">
<t>
Routing functionality is required when there are multiple routers 
deployed within the internal home network.
This functionality could be as simple as the current 'default route is up'
model of IPv4 NAT, or, more likely, it would involve running an appropriate 
routing protocol. Regardless of the solution method, the functionality
discussed below should be met.
</t>
<t>
The homenet unicast routing protocol should be based on a previously deployed 
protocol that has been shown to be reliable and robust, and that allows 
lightweight implementations.  The availability of open source implementations 
is an important consideration.
It is desirable, but not absolutely required, that the routing protocol 
be able to give a complete view of the network, and that it be able 
to pass around more than just routing information.
</t>

<t>
Multiple types of physical interfaces must be accounted for in the homenet 
routed topology.
Technologies such as Ethernet, WiFi, Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA), 
etc. must be capable of coexisting
in the same environment and should be treated as part of any routed 
deployment. The inclusion of physical layer characteristics including 
bandwidth, loss, and latency in path computation should be considered 
for optimising communication in the homenet.
</t>

<t>
The routing protocol should support the generic use of multiple customer
Internet connections, and the concurrent use of multiple delegated 
prefixes.  A routing protocol that 
can make routing decisions based on source and destination addresses is
thus desirable, to avoid upstream ISP BCP38 ingress filtering problems. 
Multihoming support should also include load-balancing to multiple 
providers, and failover from a primary to a backup link when available.  
The protocol however 
should not require upstream ISP connectivity to be established to
continue routing within the homenet. 
</t>

<t> 
The routing environment should be self-configuring, as discussed previously.
An example of how OSPFv3 can be self-configuring in a homenet is 
described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig"/>.
Minimising convergence time should be a goal in any routed
environment, but as a guideline a maximum convergence time at most 
30 seconds should be the target (this target is somewhat arbitrary, and
was chosen based on how long a typical home user might wait before 
attempting another reset; ideally the routers might have some status
light indicating they are converging, similar to an ADSL router light
indicating it is establishing a connection to its ISP).</t>

<t>
As per prefix delegation, it is assumed that a single routing solution
is in use in the homenet architecture. If there is an identified need 
to support multiple solutions, these must be interoperable. 
</t>

<t>
An appropriate mechanism is required to discover which router(s) in the 
homenet are providing the CER function.
Borders may include but are not limited to the interface to the upstream ISP,
a gateway device to a separate home network such as a LLN network, or
a gateway to a guest or private corporate extension network.
In some cases there may be no border present, which may for example occur 
before an upstream connection has been established.  The border discovery 
functionality may be integrated into the routing protocol itself, but 
may also be imported via a separate discovery mechanism.  </t>


<t>
In general, LLN or other networks should be able to attach and participate 
in the same way as the main homenet, or alternatively map/be gatewayed to 
the main homenet.  
Current home deployments use largely different 
mechanisms in sensor and basic Internet connectivity networks.  IPv6 virtual 
machine (VM) solutions may also add additional routing requirements.  
</t>

<section title="Multicast support">

<t>
It is desirable that, subject to the capacities of devices on certain media
types, multicast routing is supported across the homenet.
The natural scopes for internal multicast would be link-local or site-local, 
with the latter constrained within the homenet, but other
policy borders, e.g., to a guest subnet, or to certain media types, 
may also affect where specific multicast traffic is routed.
</t>
<t>
The homenet will need to be able to automatically configure the site multicast 
scope and scope boundary as part of the homenet edge (border) discovery process. 
</t>
<t>
There may be different drivers for multicast to be supported across the
homenet, e.g., for homenet-wide service discovery should a site-scope 
multicast service discovery protocol be defined, or
potentially for novel streaming or filesharing applications.
Where multicast is routed across a homenet an appropriate multicast routing
protocol is required, one that as per the unicast routing protocol
should be self-configuring.  It must be possible to scope or filter multicast
traffic to avoid it being flooded to network media where devices cannot
reasonably support it.
</t>
<t>
Multicast may also be received by or sourced from the homenet from/to
external networks, e.g., where video applications use multicast to 
conserve the bandwidth they consume. Such multicast traffic would
be greater than site scope.
</t>
<t>
The multicast environment should support the 
ability for applications to pick a unique multicast group to use. 
</t>

</section>

<section title="Mobility support">

<t>
Devices may be mobile within the homenet. While resident on the same
subnet, their address will remain persistent, but should devices move to
a different (wireless) subnet, they will acquire a new address in that
subnet. It is desirable that the homenet supports internal device
mobility.  To do so, the homenet may either extend the reach of
specific wireless subnets to enable wireless roaming across the 
home (availability of a specific subnet across the home), or it may 
support mobility protocols to facilitate such roaming where multiple
subnets are used.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section anchor ="security" title="Security">

<t>
The security of an IPv6 homenet is an important consideration.  The most
notable difference to the IPv4 operational model is the removal of NAT,
the introduction of global addressability of devices, and thus a need to
consider whether devices should have global reachability. Regardless,
hosts need to be able to operate securely, end-to-end where required, 
and also be robust against malicious traffic directed towards them.  
However, there
are other challenges introduced, e.g., default filtering policies at the
borders between various homenet realms.
</t>

<section anchor="addressability" title="Addressability vs reachability">
<t>
An IPv6-based home network architecture should embrace the transparent 
end-to-end communications model as described in <xref target="RFC2775"/>. 
Each device should be globally addressable, and those addresses must not 
be altered in transit. 
However, security perimeters can be applied to restrict end-to-end
communications, and thus while a host may be globally addressable
it may not be globally reachable. 
</t>
<t>
<xref target="RFC4864"></xref> describes a 'Simple Security'
model for IPv6 networks, whereby stateful perimeter filtering
can be applied to control the reachability of devices in a homenet.  
RFC 4864 states in Section 4.2 that "the use of firewalls ...
is recommended for those that want boundary
protection in addition to host defences". 
It should be noted that a 'default deny' filtering approach would
effectively replace the need for IPv4 NAT traversal protocols
with a need to 
use a signalling protocol to request a firewall hole be opened, e.g.,
a protocol such as 
<xref target="RFC6887">PCP</xref>. In networks
with multiple CERs, the signalling would need to handle the cases of 
flows that may use one or more exit routers. CERs would need to
be able to advertise their existence for such protocols.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="RFC6092"></xref> expands on RFC 4864, giving a more
detailed discussion of IPv6 perimeter security recommendations,
without mandating a 'default deny' approach. Indeed,
RFC 6092 does not enforce a particular mode of operation, 
instead stating that CERs must provide an easily selected configuration 
option that permits a 'transparent' mode, thus ensuring
a 'default allow' model is available.
The homenet architecture text makes no recommendation on the default 
setting, and refers the reader to RFC 6092.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Filtering at borders">
<t>
It is desirable that there are mechanisms to detect different types of 
borders within the homenet, as discussed previously,
and further mechanisms to then apply different types of filtering
policies at those borders, e.g., whether naming and service discovery
should pass a given border.
Any such policies should be able to be easily applied by typical
home users, e.g., to give a user in a guest network access to
media services in the home, or access to a printer.
Simple mechanisms to apply policy changes, or associations between
devices, will be required.
</t>
<t>
There are cases where full internal connectivity may not be desirable, 
e.g., in
certain utility networking scenarios, or where filtering is required
for policy reasons against guest network subnet(s). 
Some scenarios/models may as a result involve running isolated subnet(s)
with their own CERs. In such cases connectivity would only be expected
within each isolated network (though traffic may potentially
pass between them via external providers).
</t>
<t>
LLNs provide an another example of where there may be secure perimeters 
inside the homenet. Constrained LLN nodes may implement 
network key security but may depend on access policies enforced by 
the LLN border router.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Partial Effectiveness of NAT and Firewalls">
<t>
Security by way of obscurity (address translation) or through
firewalls (filtering) is at best only partially effective.  The very poor
security track record of home computer, home networking and business
PC computers and networking is testimony to this.  A security 
compromise behind the firewall of any device exposes all others,
making an entire network that relies on obscurity or a firewall as
vulnerable as the most insecure device on the private side of the
network.
</t>
<t>
However, given current evidence of home network products with very poor 
default device security, putting a firewall in place does provide some 
level of protection.  The use of firewalls today, whether a
good practice or not, is common practice and whatever protection
afforded, even if marginally effective, should not be lost. Thus,
while it is highly desirable that all hosts in a homenet be adequately 
protected by built-in security functions,  it should also be assumed 
that all CERs will continue to support appropriate perimeter defence 
functions, as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-6204bis"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Exfiltration concerns">
<t>
As homenets become more complex, with more devices, and with service
discovery potentially enabled across the whole home, there are potential
concerns over the leakage of information should devices use discovery
protocols to gather information and report it to equipment vendors or
application service providers.
</t>
<t>
While it is not clear how such exfiltration could be easily avoided,
the threat should be recognised, be it from a new piece of hardware
or some 'app' installed on personal device.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Device capabilities">
<t>
In terms of the devices, homenet hosts should implement their own
security policies in accordance to their computing capabilities.
They should have the means to request transparent communications to
be able to be initiated to them through security filters in the homenet, 
either for all ports or for specific services.
Users should have simple methods to associate devices to services that
they wish to operate transparently through (CER) borders.
</t>
</section>

<section title="ULAs as a hint of connection origin">
<t>
As noted in <xref target="security"/>, if appropriate filtering is in 
place on the CER(s), as mandated by RFC 6204 requirement S-2, a 
ULA source address may be taken as an indication of locally sourced traffic.
This indication could then be used with security settings to designate
between which nodes a particular application is allowed to communicate,
provided ULA address space is filtered appropriately at the boundary of
the realm.
</t>
</section>


</section>


<section anchor="naming-sd" title="Naming and Service Discovery">

<t>
The homenet requires devices to be able to determine and use unique names
by which they can be accessed on the network. Users and devices will need
to be able to discover devices and services available on the network,
e.g., media servers, printers, displays or specific home automation devices.
Thus naming and service discovery must be supported in the homenet, and,
given the nature of typical home network users,
the service(s) providing this function must as far as possible
support unmanaged operation.
</t>
<t>
The naming system will be required to work internally or externally,
be the user within the homenet or outside it, i.e., the user should
be able to refer to devices by name, and potentially connect to them,
wherever they may be.
The most natural way to think about such naming and service discovery 
is to enable it to work across the entire homenet 
residence (site), disregarding technical borders such as subnets 
but respecting policy borders such as those between guest and other 
internal network realms.  Remote access may be desired by the homenet
residents while travelling, but also potentially by manufacturers or 
other 'benevolent' third parties.
</t>

<section title="Discovering services">

<t>
Users will typically perform service discovery through graphical user
interfaces (GUIs)
that allow them to browse services on their network in an appropriate and 
intuitive way. Devices may also need to discover other devices, without
any user intervention or choice. Either way, such interfaces
are beyond the scope of this document, but the interface should have an
appropriate application programming interface (API) for the discovery 
to be performed.
</t>
<t>
Such interfaces may also typically hide the local domain name element 
from users, especially where only one name space is available.
However, as we discuss below, in some cases the ability to discover 
available domains may be useful.
</t>
<t>
We note that current zero-configuration
service discovery protocols are generally aimed 
at single subnets.  There is thus a choice to make for multi-subnet 
homenets as to whether such protocols should be proxied or extended 
to operate across a whole homenet.  In this context, that may mean 
bridging a link-local method, taking care to avoid loops, or extending 
the scope of multicast traffic used for the purpose.  It may mean that
some proxy or hybrid service is utilised, perhaps co-resident on the CER.
Or it may be that a new approach is preferable, e.g., flooding information
around the homenet as attributes within the routing protocol (which
could allow per-prefix configuration).  However, we should
prefer approaches that are backwardly compatible, and allow current
implementations to continue to be used.  Note that 
this document does not mandate
a particular solution, rather it expresses the principles that should be
used for a homenet naming and service discovery environment.
</t>
<t>
One of the primary challenges facing service discovery today is lack 
of interoperability due to the ever increasing number of service 
discovery protocols available. While it is conceivable for consumer 
devices to support multiple discovery protocols, this is clearly not the
most efficient use of network and computational resources. One goal of the 
homenet architecture should be a path to service discovery protocol 
interoperability either through a standards based translation scheme,
hooks into current protocols to allow some for of communication among 
discovery protocols, extensions to support a central service repository
in the homenet, or simply convergence towards a unified protocol suite.
</t>

<section title="Assigning names to devices">

<t>
Given the large number of devices that may be networked in the future,
devices should have a means to generate their own unique names within
a homenet, and to detect clashes should they arise, e.g., where a second 
device of the same type/vendor as an existing device with 
the same default name is deployed, or where a new subnet is added to
the homenet which already has a device of the same name.
It is expected that a device should have a fixed name while within the
scope of the homenet.
</t>
<t>
Users will also want simple ways to (re)name devices, again most likely
through an appropriate and intuitive interface that is beyond the scope
of this document. Note the name a user assigns to a device may be a
label that is stored on the device as an attribute of the device, and
may be distinct from the name used in a name service, e.g., 'Study Laser
Printer' as opposed to printer2.&lt;somedomain&gt;.
</t>

</section>


<section title="The homenet name service">

<t>
The homenet name service should support both lookups and discovery.
A lookup would operate via a direct query to a known service, while
discovery may use multicast messages or a service where applications 
register in order to be found.
</t>
<t>
It is highly desirable that the homenet name service must at the very 
least co-exist with the Internet name service. There should also be
a bias towards proven, existing solutions. The strong implication is
thus that the homenet service is DNS-based, or DNS-compatible.
There are naming protocols that are designed to be configured and
operate Internet-wide, like unicast-based DNS, but also protocols
that are designed for zero-configuration local environments, like 
mDNS <xref target="RFC6762"></xref>.
</t>
<t>
When DNS is used as the homenet name service, it typically includes 
both a resolving service and an authoritative service. The authoritative 
service hosts the homenet related zone.
One approach when provisioning such a name service, which is designed to 
facilitate name resolution from the global Internet,
is to run an authoritative name service on the CER and
a secondary authoritative name service provided by the ISP or perhaps an
external third party. 
</t>
<t>
Where zero configuration 
name services are used, it is desirable that these
can also coexist with the Internet name service. In particular, 
where the homenet is using a global name space, it is desirable that  
devices have the ability, where desired, to add entries to that name space.  
There should also be a mechanism for such entries to be
removed or expired from the global name space.
</t>
<t>
To protect against attacks such as cache poisoning, where an attacker
is able to insert a bogus DNS entry in the local cache, it is desirable
to support appropriate name service security methods, including DNS
Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033"></xref>, on both
the authoritative server and the resolver sides. Where DNS is used,
the homenet router or naming service must not prevent DNSSEC from
operating.
</t>
<t>
While this document does not specify hardware requirements, it is worth
noting briefly here that e.g., in support of DNSSEC, appropriate 
homenet devices should have good random number generation capability, 
and future homenet specifications should indicate where high quality 
random number generators, i.e., with decent entropy, are needed.
</t>
<t>
Finally, the impact of a change in CER must be considered. It 
would be desirable
to retain any relevant state (configuration) that was held in the old CER.
This might imply that state information should be distributed in the 
homenet, to be recoverable by/to the new CER, or to the homenet's ISP
or a third party externally provided service by some means. 
</t>


</section>

<section title="Name spaces">

<t>
If access to homenet devices is required remotely from
anywhere on the Internet, then at least one globally unique name space is 
required, though the use of multiple name spaces should not be precluded.
One approach is that the name space(s) used for the homenet would be served 
authoritatively by the homenet, most likely by a server resident on the CER.
Such name spaces may be acquired by the user or provided/generated 
by their ISP or an alternative externally provided 
service.  It is likely that
the default case is that a homenet will use a global domain provided by
the ISP, but advanced users wishing to use a name space that is independent
of their provider in the longer term should be able to acquire and use
their own domain name. 
For users wanting to use their own independent domain names, such services
are already available.
</t>
<t>
Devices may also be assigned different names in different name spaces,
e.g., by third parties who may manage systems or devices in the homenet
on behalf of the resident(s).  Remote management of the homenet is out
of scope of this document.
</t>
<t>
If however a global name space is not available, the homenet will need to
pick and use a local name space which would only have meaning within 
the local homenet (i.e., it would not be used for remote access to the 
homenet).  The .local name space currently has a special meaning
for certain existing protocols which have link-local scope, and is 
thus not appropriate for multi-subnet home networks. A different
name space is thus required for the homenet.
</t>
<t>
One approach for picking a local name space is to use an Ambiguous Local
Qualified Domain Name (ALQDN) space, such as .sitelocal (or an appropriate
name reserved for the purpose). While this is a simple
approach, there is the potential in principle for devices that are 
bookmarked somehow by name by an application in one homenet to be confused 
with a device with the same name in another homenet.  In practice however the
underlying service discovery protocols should be capable of handling
moving to a network where a new device is using the same name as a device
used previously in another homenet.
</t>
<t>
An alternative approach for a local name space would be to use a Unique
Locally Qualified Domain Name (ULQDN) space 
such as .&lt;UniqueString&gt;.sitelocal. The &lt;UniqueString&gt; 
could be generated in a variety of ways, one potentially 
being based on the local /48 ULA prefix being used
across the homenet. Such a &lt;UniqueString&gt; should survive a cold
restart, i.e., be consistent after a network power-down, or,
if a value is not set on startup, the CER or device 
running the name service should generate a default value.
It would be desirable for the homenet user to be able to override
the &lt;UniqueString&gt; with a value of their choice, but that would 
increase the likelihood of a name conflict. Any generated
 &lt;UniqueString&gt; should not be predictable; thus adding a salt/hash
function would be desirable.
</t>
<t>
In the (likely) event that the homenet is accessible from outside the 
homenet (using the global name space), it is vital that the homenet name
space follow the rules and conventions of the global name space.
In this mode of operation, names in the homenet (including those
automatically generated by devices) must be usable as labels in
the global name space.  <xref target="RFC5890"></xref> describes 
considerations for Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).
</t>
<t>
Also, with the introduction of new 'dotless' top level domains, there 
is also potential for ambiguity between, for example, a local host called 
'computer' and (if it is registered) a .computer gTLD. Thus qualified
names should always be used, whether these are exposed to the user or not.
The IAB has issued a statement which explains why dotless domains should 
be considered harmful <xref target="IABdotless"></xref>.
</t>
<t>
There may be use cases where either different name spaces may be desired 
for different realms in the homenet, or for segmentation of a single name space
within the homenet. 
Thus hierarchical name space management is likely to be required.
There should also be nothing to prevent individual device(s) being 
independently registered in external name spaces.
</t>
<t>
Where a user is in a remote network wishing to access devices
in their home network, there may be a requirement to consider the
domain search order presented where multiple associated name spaces exist.
This also implies that a domain discovery function is desirable.
</t>
<t>
It may be the case that not all devices in the homenet are made available 
by name via an Internet name space, and that a 'split view' is preferred 
for certain devices, whereby devices inside the homenet see different 
DNS responses to those outside.
</t>
<t>
This document makes no assumption about the presence or omission of
a reverse lookup service. There is an argument that it may be useful
for presenting logging information to users with meaningful device names
rather than literal addresses. There are also some services, most notably
email mail exchangers, where some operators have chosen to require a 
valid reverse lookup before accepting connections.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Independent operation">

<t>
Name resolution and service discovery for reachable devices must 
continue to function if the local network is disconnected from 
the global Internet,
e.g., a local media server should still be available even if
the Internet link is down for an extended period.  
This implies the local network should also be able to perform
a complete restart in the absence of external connectivity,
and have local naming and service discovery operate correctly.
</t>
<t>
The approach described above of a local authoritative name service
with a cache would allow local operation for sustained ISP outages.
</t>
<t>
Having an independent local trust anchor is desirable, to support
secure exchanges should external connectivity be unavailable.
</t>
<t>
A change in ISP should not affect local naming and service 
discovery. However, if the homenet uses a global name space provided by 
the ISP, then this will obviously have an impact if the user changes
their network provider.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Considerations for LLNs">

<t>
In some parts of the homenet, in particular LLNs or any devices where
battery power is used, devices may be sleeping,
in which case a proxy for such nodes may be required, that could
respond (for example)
to multicast service discovery requests. Those same devices or parts
of the network may have less capacity for multicast traffic that
may be flooded from other parts of the network.
In general, message utilisation should be efficient considering 
the network technologies and constrained devices that
the service may need to operate over.
</t>

<t>
There are efforts underway to determine naming and discovery
solutions for use by the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> in
LLN networks. These are outside the scope of this document.
</t>

</section>

<section title="DNS resolver discovery">

<t>
Automatic discovery of a name service to allow client devices in the
homenet to resolve external domains on the Internet is required,
and such discovery must support clients that may be a
number of router hops away from the name service.  Similarly it
may be desirable to convey any DNS domain search list that may
be in effect for the homenet.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Devices roaming to/from the homenet">

<t>
It is likely that some devices which have 
registered names within the 
homenet Internet name space and that are mobile will attach to the Internet 
at other locations and acquire an IP address at those locations.  Devices 
may move between different homenets. In
such cases it is desirable that devices may be accessed by the same
name as is used in their home network. 
</t>
<t>
Solutions to this problem are not discussed in this document. They 
may include use of Mobile IPv6 or Dynamic DNS, either of which would
put additional requirements on to the homenet, or establishment of a
(VPN) tunnel to a server in the home network.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Other Considerations">

<t>
This section discusses two other considerations for home networking that
the architecture should not preclude, but that this text is neutral towards.
</t>

<section title="Quality of Service">

<t>
Support for Quality of Service 
in a multi-service homenet may be a requirement,
e.g., for a critical system (perhaps healthcare related), or for
differentiation between different types of traffic (file sharing,
cloud storage, live streaming, VoIP, etc).  Different media types
may have different such properties or capabilities.  
</t>
<t>
However, homenet scenarios should require no new Quality of
Service protocols.  
A DiffServ
<xref target="RFC2475"/> approach with a small number of predefined 
traffic classes may generally be sufficient, though at present there 
is little experience of Quality of Service
deployment in home networks. It is likely
that QoS, or traffic prioritisation, methods will be required at the
CER, and potentially around boundaries between different media types
(where for example some traffic may simply not be appropriate for
some media, and need to be dropped to avoid overloading the constrained
media).
</t>
<t>
There may also be complementary mechanisms that could be beneficial 
to application performance and behaviour in
the homenet domain, such as ensuring proper buffering algorithms are
used as described in <xref target="Gettys11"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Operations and Management">
<t>
The homenet should be self-organising and configuring as far as possible,
and thus should not need to be pro-actively managed by the home user.  
Thus specific protocols to manage the network are not discussed in this 
document.
</t>
<t>
There may be some configuration parameters which are exposed to 
users, e.g., SSID name(s), or wireless security key(s). Users may also
be expected to be aware of the functions of certain devices they 
connect, e.g., which are providing a server function, though service
discovery protocols should make their selection as intuitive as
possible. 
</t>
<t>
As discussed in <xref target="addressability"></xref> the default
setting on the homenet-ISP border for inbound traffic may be default 
deny, default allow, or some position inbetween. Whatever the 
default position, it should be possible for the user to change
the setting.
</t>
<t>
Users may also be interested in the status of their networks and
devices on the network, in which case simplified monitoring mechanisms
may be desirable.  It may also be the case that an ISP, or a third party,
might offer management of the homenet on behalf of a user, in which case
management protocols would be required.  How such management is done
is out of scope of this document; many solutions exist.
</t>
<t>
It is expected that network management functions would be available 
over IPv6 transport, even where the homenet is dual-stack.
</t>

</section>


</section>

<section title="Implementing the Architecture on IPv6">

<t>This architecture text encourages re-use of existing protocols.
Thus the necessary mechanisms are largely already part of the IPv6
protocol set and common implementations, though there are some
exceptions. 
</t>
<t>
For automatic routing, it is expected that solutions can be found based
on existing protocols. Some relatively smaller 
updates are likely to be required, e.g.,
a new mechanism may be needed in order to turn a selected protocol on by 
default, a mechanism may be required to automatically assign prefixes
to links within the homenet.
</t>
<t>
Some functionality, if required by the architecture, may need more significant
changes or require development of new protocols, e.g., support for 
multihoming with multiple exit routers would likely 
require extensions to support
source and destination address based routing within the homenet.
</t>
<t>
Some protocol changes are however required in the architecture, e.g.,
for name resolution and service discovery, extensions to existing 
zero configuration 
link-local name resolution protocols are needed to enable them 
to work across subnets, within the scope of the home network site.</t>

<t>
Some of the hardest problems in developing solutions for home networking
IPv6 architectures include discovering the right borders where the
'home' domain ends and the service provider domain begins, deciding
whether some of the necessary discovery mechanism extensions should affect
only the network infrastructure or also hosts, and the ability to turn
on routing, prefix delegation and other functions in a backwards
compatible manner.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Conclusions">

<t>
This text defines principles and requirements for a homenet architecture.
The principles and requirements documented here should be observed by
any future texts describing homenet protocols for routing, prefix
management, security, naming or service discovery.
