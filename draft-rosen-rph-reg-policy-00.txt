1.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any the security considerations
   beyond those in [RFC4412]


2.  Introduction

   [RFC4412] defines "Resource-Priority Namespaces" and "Resource-
   Priority Priority-values" registries.  The management policy of these
   registries is "Standards Action" as defined in [RFC5226].  Experience
   has suggested that a document that only defines a new namespace with
   its priorities, and does not create new protocol semantics, should
   not be a standards-track document.  This document updates [RFC4412]
   to change the management policy of the registries to "IETF Review".


3.  IANA Considerations

   Change the management policy of management policy of the "Resource-
   Priority Namespaces" and "Resource-Priority Priority-values"
   registries to "IETF Review" as defined in [RFC5226].

              Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)",
