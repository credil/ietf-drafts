1.  Introduction

   I.D-ietf-nvo3-framework [I-D.ietf-nvo3-framework] specifies a
   framework that defines mechanism to support large scale network
   virtualization by connecting L2 or L3 virtualized network over L3
   tunnels.  Various tunneling options like IPv4, IPv6 or MPLS can be
   used in underlying network.

   Section 3.8 of [I.D-ietf-nvo3-dataplane-requirement] specifies the
   requirement of OAM tool that performs connectivity verification and
   fault isolation along with revealing ECMP paths between NVE nodes.
   While the mechanism described in RFC4379 [RFC4379] helps with
   satisfying this OAM requirement when MPLS tunnel is used, there is no
   native way to acheive the same when IPv4 or IPv6 is used as tunneling
   option.

Internet-Draft Detecting NVO3 Overlay Data Plane Failures      July 2013


   This document describes a simple and efficient mechanism to perform
   L2 or L3 VN Context validation and to detect any data plane failures
   in IPv4 or IPv6 overlay network by re-purposing and extending MPLS
   Ping mechanism defined in RFC4379 [RFC4379].  This document also
   describes the mechanism to reveal all available paths (multi path)
   between any ingress and egress NVE nodes.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   L2 VN: Layer 2 Virtual Network

   L3 VN: Layer 3 Virtual Network

   NVE: Network Virtualization Edge

   ECMP: Equal Cost multiple path

4.  Packet Format

   NVO3 PATH Ping packet is a IPv4 or IPv6 UDP packet and the basic
   structure of the packet remains the same as mentioned in Section 3 of
   RFC4379 [RFC4379].

   This document introduces a new flag in Global Flags field defined in
   RFC4379 [RFC4379].  The new format of the Global Flags field is:


          0                   1
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |             MBZ         |N|T|V|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The V flag is described in RFC4379 [RFC4379] and T flag is described
   in RFC6425 [RFC6425].

   The N flag (NVO3 PATH Ping) MUST be set in echo request and reply
   packet only when it is used to validate NVO3 Path.

   The Message Type is one of the following:

          Value    Meaning
          -----    -------
          11    NVO3 Echo Request
          12    NVO3 Echo Reply


   The Reply Mode can be one of the following:


             Value    Meaning
             -----    -------
             11    Do not Reply
             12    Reply via IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet


   Return codes and Subcodes are described in section 4.1.

   The Sender's Handle, Sequence Number, TimeStamp sent and TimeStamp
   Received field are as mentioned in Section 3 of RFC4379 [RFC4379].

   The TLV format is same as mentioned in [RFC4379] and this document
   introduce a new TLV described later.

4.1.  Return Code and Return Subcode

   Responder uses Return code field to reply with validity check or any
   error message to Initiator.  It doesnt carry any meaning in Echo
   Request and should be set as zero.

   The Return Code can be one of the following:


             Value    Meaning
             -----    -------
             100    No Return Code
             101    Malformed Echo Request Received
             102    One or more TLVs not understood
             103    Egress for the Target
             104    No control plane mapping for the Target Object <RSC>
             105    Downstream Detailed Mapping mismatch
             108    Packet-Forward-OK

Internet-Draft Detecting NVO3 Overlay Data Plane Failures      July 2013


   The Return Subcode contains the pointer in Target Object TLV for
   which the Replying node doesnt have a control plane mapping.  For
   example, when NVE receives Target Object TLV with multiple Sub-TLVs
   and if NVE doesnt have an entry for second Sub-TLV should include 2
   as RSC value.

4.2.  TLV Format

   The document introduces the below list of TLVs used in NVO3 Echo
   packets:

           Type                   Value Field
          ------                  -----------
             101                  Target Object


4.2.1.  Target Object TLV

   Target Object TLV is a list of Sub-TLVs that carries the element
   against which the path or control plane validation is done.

   This document defines the below Target Object Sub-TLVs:

            Sub-Type       Length            Value Field
            --------       ------            -----------
                1            5                IPv4 prefix
                2            17               IPv6 Prefix
                3         variable            L2 VN ID
                4         variable            L3 VN ID


   NVO3 ECHO Request MUST have a Target Object TLV with atleast one Sub-
   TLV which describe the egress node about the element to be validated.

   For example, if NVE X wanted to verify that MAC M1 is associated with
   VN ID VN1, it carries relevant information like VN ID and the MAC
   address in Sub-TLV type 3 and send to egress NVE.  Egress NVE on
   receiving NVO3 Echo Request will validate the Target Object and will
   reply back with respective Return Code.

   New Sub-TLVs can be proposed as and when required in future.

4.2.2.  Downstream Detailed Mapping Extension

   This document extends the Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV defined in
   Section 3.3 of RFC6424 [RFC6424] to be used in NVO3 scenarios with
   IPv4 or IPv6 based core network.  This document introdues a new DS
   flag and the format is as below:

            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                  Flag  Name and Meaning
                  ----  ----------------
                   P    Set when used in NVO3 Ping


   The P flag (NVO3 Path ping) MUST be set in Downstream Detailed
   Mapping TLV only when it is used in NVO3 scenarios.  When P flag is
   set, I flag MUST NOT be set.

   For simplicity, The DDMAP with N flag set in DS flag will be referred
   as NVO3 DDMAP in this document.

   This document also defines the below new multipath types to be used
   in NVO3 Path ping.

              Type       Meaning       Multipath information
            --------  --------------   -----------------------
                11      UDP Port Mask       UDP Port and bit mask
                12      Flow Label Mask     IPv6 Flow label and bit mask


   Multipath Information

      UDP port or IPv6 Flow label range encoded according to the
      Multipath type.  The next section explains the encoding details.

4.2.3.  Multipath Information Encoding

   Based on the Multipath type, the Multipath Information encodes Flow
   label range or UDP port range that will excercise each path.  The
   Multipath encoding follows the same procedure specifies in
   Section 3.3.1 of RFC4379 [RFC4379].  For completeness, it is
   explained in this document with UDP port range and IPv6 FLow label
   range.

   Multipath type 1 encodes UDP port range.  The UDP prefix is formatted
   as a base UDP port value with non-prefix low-order bits set to zero.
   Since the UDp port is 16 bits, the leading 16 bits are set as zeros.
   The maximum prefix (including leading zeros) length can be 27.
   Following the prefix is a mask of length 2^(32-prefix-length) bits.
   Each bit set to one represents a valid UDP port.  UDP port values of
   all the odd numbers between 32704 and 3267 would be encoded as below:

   Multipath type 2 encoded IPv6 Fow label range.  The formatting is as
   mentioned above for UDP port range except that the leading zeros are
   set for leading 8 bits.

   If the received Multipath Information is non-null, the UDP ports or
   IPv6 Flow labels MUST be picked from the set provided.  if the range
   in received set cannot be mapped to a particular downstream
   interface, the type MUST be set to 0 for that interface while
   replying.  If the received Multipath type is null, the type MUST be
   set to 0 while replying.

5.  NVO3 Echo Packet Indicator

   Unlike MPLS LSP Echo, the IP destination address in NVO3 Echo packet
   will be the actual destination of egress node and this raises a need
   to have an OAM indicator that can be used by transit nodes to
   differentiate between NVO3 Echo packet and data packet.  This
   document explains the same as below:

5.1.  When the core is IPv6 network

   This document proposes the below IPv6 Extension header and the format
   is as below:


       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Next Header  |  Hdr Ext Len  |R|R|R|R|R|R|R|R|R|R|R|R|R|R|R|N|

      NVO3 OAM Indicator

   Any node on initiating NVO3 Echo Request MUST include IPv6 OAM
   Extension Header with NVO3 OAM flag set.  Any node on replying back
   with NVO3 Echo Reply MUST include IPv6 OAM Extension Header with NVO3
   OAM flag set.  Any transit node on receiving IPv6 destinated packet
   with TTL=1 SHOULD interpret the payload as NVO3 ECHO packet if IPv6
   OAM Extension header is present.

5.2.  When the core is IPv4 network

   Any transit node on receiving IPv4 destinated packet with TTL=1
   SHOULD interpret the payload as NVO3 ECHO packet if UDP port is 3503.

6.  Theory of Operation

   NVO3 Echo Request and Reply packet are UDP packet with destination
   port as 3503.  This section describes the procedure in Initiating and
   responding nodes.

6.1.  Sending NVO3 Echo Request

   Initiator MUST include the respective Sub-TLV for the target(s) to be
   validated (L2 or L3 VNI or NVE address) in Target Object TLV.  It
   also MUST set the N flag in Global Flags (Section 4) and set the
   message type as 11.  The Reply mode is set to the desired mode ( type
   11 or 12); Return code and Return Subcode are set to zero.  The
   Sender's Handle and Sequence number are set by Initiator.

   The source UDP port can be choosen by the Initiator and the
   destination UDP port is set to 3503.  The IP header is set as
   follows: the source IP address is a routable address of the sender;
   the destination IP address is the target egress NVE address.  When
   the core is IPv6 network, Initiator MUST include IPv6 OAM Extension
   header.

   In ping mode (Connectivity check), the IP TTL is set to 255.  In
   traceroute mode (Fault isolation), the IP TTL is set successively
   from 1 and MUST stop sending the Request if it receives a reply with
   Return code 103 or 104.

6.2.  Receiving NVO3 Echo Request









Kumar, et al.           Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft Detecting NVO3 Overlay Data Plane Failures      July 2013


   Sending an NVO3 Echo Request to control plane for payload processsing
   is done by IP TTL expiration in case of IPv4 and a combination of IP
   TTL expiration and IPv6 OAM Extension header incase of IPv6.  The
   control plane further identifies it as NVO3 Echo packet by a
   combination of UDP destion port 3503 and N flag in Global flag field
   (Section 4).

   Any node on receiving NVO3 Echo Request MUST send Echo Reply with
   Return code "Malformed Echo Request received" to Initiator if the
   packet fails sanity check.  If the sanity check for NVO3 Echo Request
   is fine, Any node should store the below temporary variables:

   o  Interface-I: Interface over which Echo Request is received.

   o  Address-A: Local address on Interface-I.

   o  Index-I: Interface Index for upstream node interface connected to
      Interface-I.

   o  Destination-D: Destination address of the NVO3 Echo Request.

6.2.1.  Transit Node procedure

   Any transit node on receiving NVO3 Echo Request should perform the
   below:

   1.  Transit node MUST only check the first (or top) Sub-TLV and MUST
       NOT iterate to other Sub-TLVs beneath.  Ideally the first Sub-TLV
       will be IPv4 prefix or IPv6 prefix Sub-TLV on which the transit
       node is required to act upon.  It MUST set the Return code as
       "One or more TLVs not understood" if the first (or top) Sub-TLV
       in Target Object TLV is not understood.

   2.  If the TLV is understood, Tranit node MUST perform longest match
       lookup in its local forwarding table and set the Return code as
       "Replying node has no control plane mapping for the Target
       Object" and Return Subcode as 1, if there is no matching entry
       for the prefix in Sub-TLV in its local forwarding table.

   3.  If the received NVO3 Echo Request has NVO3 Downstream Detailed
       Mapping TLV MUST set the Return code as "Downstream Detailed
       Mapping mismatch" if any of the below fails:

       *  When Address Type is 1, Address-A SHOULD match Downstream
          Interface Index and Router ID or Address-A SHOULD match
          Downstream Address.

Internet-Draft Detecting NVO3 Overlay Data Plane Failures      July 2013


       *  When Address Type is 2 or 4, Index-I SHOULD match Downstream
          Interface Index and Router ID SHOULD match Downstream Address.

       *  When Address Type is 3, Address-A SHOULD match Downstream
          Interface Index and Router ID SHOULD match Downstream Address.

   4.  If the IP prefix in Sub-TLV matches any entry in local forwarding
       table and if step 4 satisfies the received NVO3 DDMAP or if there
       is no NVO3 DDMAP received in Echo Request, Transit node MUST set
       the Return code as "Packet-Forward-OK" and set DDMAP field for
       each available multipath egress interface in forwarding table.

   5.  If the received NVO3 Echo Request has Multipath information sub-
       TLV in NVO3 DDMAP, Transit node MUST reply as mentioned section
       5.5.

6.2.2.  Edge Node procedure

   Any Edge node (NVE) on receiving NVO3 Echo Request should perform the
   below:

   1.  If the sanity check is fine, NVE MUST check all the Sub-TLVs and
       MUST set the Return code as "One or more TLVs not understood" if
       any of the TLV is not understood.

   2.  If the TLVs are understood, NVE node MUST send Echo Reply with
       Return code "Replying node has no control plane mapping for the
       Target Object" and Return Subcode as 1, if there is no matching
       entry in local forwarding table to take a forwarding decision.

   3.  NVE node MUST set the Return code as "Replying node is the egress
       for the Target" if the IP address in first (or top) Sub-TLV in
       Target Object TLV is locally configured to this node and there is
       no further sub-TLV in Target Object TLV

   4.  If the Target Object TLV have more than one Sub-TLV, NVE MUST
       validate all the Sub-TLVs and set the Return code as "Replying
       node has no control plane mapping for the Target Object" and
       Return Subcode as pointer of the Sub-TLV which fails the
       validation.

   5.  If the received Echo Request has NVO3 Downstream Detailed Mapping
       TLV MUST check as mentioned in step 4 of section 6.2.1.

   6.  If the validation for all Sub-TLVs in Target Object TLV is fine,
       NVE MUST set Return code as "Replying node is the egress for the
       Target" and SHOULD NOT include NVO3 DDMAP.

6.3.  Sending NVO3 Echo Reply

   NVO3 Echo Reply is a UDP packet and MUST be sent only in response to
   received NVO3 Echo Request.  The format of NVO3 Echo Reply is same as
   Echo request.

   Responder MUST fill the DDMAP field, Return Code and Return Subcode
   from previous section.  It MUST also set the N flag in Global Flags
   and set the message type as 12.  The Sender's Handle, Sequence Number
   field MUST be copied from the received Echo Request.

   The source UDP port is set to 3503 and the source UDP port of
   received Echo Request is copied to destination UDP port of Echo
   Reply.  The IP header is set as follows: the source IP address is a
   routable address of the responder; the destination IP address is
   coped from source address of Echo Request and IP TTL is set to 255.
   When the core is IPv6 network, Responder MUST include IPv6 OAM
   Extension Header.

6.4.  Receiving NVO3 Echo Reply

   Any node should receive NVO3 Echo Reply only in response to an NVO3
   Echo Request that it sent.  Initiator MUST drop the packet if it
   fails sanity check.  If the sanity check is fine, the Echo Reply
   should be mapped with the respective Echo Request using the
   destination port and Sender's Handle. if there is no match, the Echo
   Reply MUST be ignored.  Else, it checks the Sequence Number to match
   the iteration.

   In traceroute mode, If the Echo Reply contains NVO3 DDMAP, it SHOULD
   copy the same to subsequent Echo Request(s).

6.5.  Dealing with Equal-Cost-Multi-Path (ECMP)

   For redundancy and load balancing purpose, It is common to see
   multiple equal cost paths between ingress and egress NVE and it is a
   local matter to transit node to decide the egress interface based on
   local hashing algorithm.  It is common to see deployment with routers
   that support load-balancing based on UDP ports or based on IPv6 Flow
   label.  So it is useful to have the OAM tool to exercise all possible
   paths between ingress and egress NVEs.

   This can be achieved using Multipath Information Sub-TLV in NVO3
   DDMAP.  This can be used as follows:

   o  When the core is IPv6 network, the Initiator will send Echo
      Request in traceroute mode (start with TTL as 1 and increment for
      subsequent message) with Multipath type set to 2.  Any transit

      node will include multipath encoding for each downstream interface
      in a way that the local hashing decision based on IPv6 flow label
      will use the respective downstream path.  Initiator will then send
      NVO3 Echo Request with respective Flow label to excercise these
      paths.

   o  When the core is Ipv4 network, the Initiator will send Echo
      Request in traceroute mode with Multipath type set to 1.  Any
      transit node will include multipath encoding for each downstream
      interface in a way that local hashing decision based on UDP port
      will use the respective downstream path. initiator will then send
      NVO3 Echo Request with respective UDP port as source port to
      excercise these paths.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document reuse UDP port 3503 for NVO3 Echo packets.

7.1.  Message Types, Reply Modes, Return Codes

   This document request to assign the Message Types and Reply mode
   mentioned in Section 4 and Return code mentioned in Section 4.1

7.2.  TLVs

   The TLVs and Sub-TLVs requested by this document for IANA
   consideration are the following:

           Type        Sub-Type            Value Field
          -------      --------            -----------
            101                             Target Object
                           1                IPv4 Prefix
                           2                IPv6 Prefix
                           3                L2 VN ID
                           4                L3 VN ID


8.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration for NVO3 Ping is similar to ICMP or LSP
   Ping.  AS like ICMP or LSP ping, NVO3 may be exposed to Denial-of-
   service attacks and it is RECOMMENDED to regulate the NVO3 Ping
   packet flow to control plane.  A rate limiter SHOULD be applied to
   avoid any attack

   As like ICMP or LSP Ping, a traceroute can be used to obtain network
   information.  It is RECOMMENDED that the implementation check the
   source address of the Echo messages against any local secured list
   like access list before processing the message further
