                Using Secure DNS to Assert S/MIME Usage
                        draft-srose-smimelock-00

Abstract

   This draft defines and discusses the use of a new DNS resource record
   (RR) type to address S/MIME downgrade attacks.  The SMIMELOCK RR
   allows a domain to convey general message security policy.
   Primarily, this RR allows the domain owner to advertise a policy that
   all legitimate messages from this domain will be signed by a
   verifiable certificate.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   While it is difficult to change the content of an S/MIME signed
   message without detection, it is not difficult to remove the S/MIME
   wrapper and change the content of the resulting unsigned message.  If
   the recipient of the altered message did not know that the message
   originally contained a digital signature then there would be no
   indication of foul play.

   Likewise, attackers masquerading as valid users can send messages
   purporting to be from those users.  Without digital signatures it is
   difficult for the recipient to know whether or not the message was
   legitimate.

   The introduction of a new DNS record type, SMIMELOCK, provides a
   DNSSEC [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and [RFC4035] authenticated mechanism to
   enable MUAs to determine whether a message sender's policy was to
   digitally sign all messages before sending.  Based on SMIMELOCK query
   results, each domain is assigned one of two policy states: MUST SIGN
   or POLICY UNKNOWN.

   To reduce unnecessary DNS queries, the SMIMELOCK policy applies to
   all users within a domain (the "right-hand side" of the email
   address, called the "domain" in RFC 5322 [RFC5322]).

   This proposal is produced in conjunction with a DANE/SMIME proposal,
   but the two MAY be used independently.  The lock concept is based on
   the RLOCK record proposed in draft-gersch-grow-revdns-bgp-02.
   [I-D.gersch-grow-revdns-bgp]

1.2.  Scope

   We limit the scope of this internet draft to associating S/MIME
   message signing policy with all users of a given domain.  S/MIME
   enveloped- only (encrypted) messages provide no data integrity or
   source authentication.  If a message was wrongly sent in plaintext
   then the damage was already done once it was sent.  Conversely, if a
   message is received without a signature then damage occurs only when
   trust or lack of trust is incorrectly assigned to the message.

   SMIMELOCK results SHOULD be used only by MUAs processing received
   messages.  MUAs preparing messages to send SHOULD NOT base message
   signature decisions on SMIMELOCK results.

   This proposal is limited to authenticating message contents and end-
   entity senders.  It is distinct and complementary to existing

   processes (like SPF [RFC4408] or DKIM [RFC6376] and ADSP[RFC5617]).

2.  The SMIMELOCK Resource Record

   The SMIMELOCK DNS resource record (RR) is used to convey a domain's
   message signing policy to MUAs processing received messages.  This
   provides the ability for MUAs to identify and flag messages in
   violation of their originating domain's advertised signing policy.

   The type value for the SMIMELOCK RR type is to be assigned.

   The SMIMELOCK RR is class independent.

   The SMIMELOCK RR has no special TTL requirements.

   A zone MUST NOT contain more than one SMIMELOCK record for the same
   owner name.

2.1.  The SMIMELOCK RDATA Format

   The RDATA of an SMIMELOCK consists of a single octet.  The values
   have the following meanings:

       0: reserved
       1: ALL (interpreted as MUST SIGN all messages)

   Any result other than ALL is interpreted as POLICY UNKNOWN

   Other values (i.e. policies) could be added in the future, but
   conditional policies are discouraged as they increase the opportunity
   for downgrade attacks.

2.2.  SMIMELOCK RR Example

   The SMIMELOCK policy applies to all users in a domain (where domain
   refers to the "right hand side" of an email address).  For example,
   to request an SMIMELOCK RR applicable to "alice@example.com", the
   QNAME would be "example.com".  The query result would apply equally
   to any message originator from the example domain (e.g.
   "bob@example.com", "chuck@example.com", etc.).  A wildcard RR will
   extend the policy to cover fictitious subdomains (e.g.
   frank@fake.example.com") and individual hostnames in the zone.

   SMIMELOCK resource records for the example.com zone:

               example.com.    IN SMIMELOCK  ALL
               *.example.com.  IN SMIMELOCK  ALL

3.  Use of SMIMELOCK Resource Records in S/MIME

   Use of SMIMELOCK is opt-in by the sending domain and by the receiving
   MUA.  If a domain owner creates an SMIMELOCK RR, there is no
   guarantee that MUAs will check it.

3.1.  DNSSEC considerations

   Responses for SMIMELOCK RR's SHOULD be disregarded unless the RRSet
   passes DNSSEC validity checks.  Criteria in [RFC6698] section 4.1 MAY
   be used.  The absence of a valid SMIMELOCK result (either NOERROR/
   NODATA RCODE or SMIMELOCK RR with unknown RDATA values) SHOULD be
   interpreted as POLICY UNKNOWN by the client.

3.2.  Signature Checks

   A compliant MUA MUST check SMIMELOCK status for the domain of each
   message received unless the message is S/MIME signed.  MUST SIGN
   status MAY be cached and re-used up to the life of the SMIMELOCK RR
   TTL value.  POLICY UNKNOWN status MAY be cached by the MUA for up to
   24 hours before issuing a new SMIMELOCK request for the domain.

   A compliant MUA MUST flag SMIMELOCK signature policy violations (i.e.
   unsigned messages originating from domains with MUST SIGN policy).
   Unsigned messages from domains with MUST SIGN policy MUST NOT be
   presented to the recipient as free from errors.  Unsigned messages
   from domains with MUST SIGN policy MAY be presented to the recipient
   as having failed signature verification.

3.3.  Status Checks

   Since this process fails silently, active checks SHOULD be
   implemented by administrators of domains and MUAs.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  SMIMELOCK RRType

   This document uses a new DNS RR type, SMIMELOCK whose value [TBD] has
   been allocated by IANA from the Resource Record (RR) TYPEs
   subregistry of the Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters registry.

4.2.  SMIMELOCK Policy Statement Types

   This document creates a new registry, "SMIMELOCK Policy Statement
   Types".  The registry policy is "Specification Required".  The
   initial entries in the registry are:

      Value    Short description                       Reference
      ----------------------------------------------------------
      0        Reserved                                [this doc]
      1        ALL                                     [this doc]
      2-255    Unassigned

   Applications to the registry can request specific values that have
   yet to be assigned.

5.  Security Considerations

   There is an acknowledged shortcoming in this current proposal that an
   attacker need only block or alter the DNS response to disable the
   SMIMELOCK capability.  However, the ability to affect DNS (signed
   with DNSSEC) for a recipient's MUA is considerably more difficult
   than sending a spoofed email to the recipient.

   This draft also seeks input on the best way to convey signature
   policy violations to message recipients.  It is possible that a poor
   implementation could make matters worse.  If a MUA treats a signature
   policy violation as a failed signature verification, then it SHOULD
   NOT present views of the data in which the message appears to be
   signed unless it is clear that the signature verification failed.
