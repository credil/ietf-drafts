        Reusing the IPv4 Identification Field in Atomic Packets
                 draft-briscoe-intarea-ipv4-id-reuse-01

Abstract

   This specification takes a new approach to extensibility that is both
   principled and a hack.  It builds on recent moves to formalise the
   increasingly common practice where fragmentation in IPv4 more closely
   matches that of IPv6.  The large majority of IPv4 packets are now
   'atomic', meaning indivisible.  In such packets, the 16 bits of the
   IPv4 Identification (IPv4 ID) field are redundant and could be freed
   up for the Internet community to put to other uses, at least within
   the constraints imposed by their original use for reassembly.  This
   specification defines the process for redefining the semantics of
   these bits.  It uses the previously reserved control flag in the IPv4
   header to indicate that these 16 bits have new semantics.  Great care
   is taken throughout to ease incremental deployment, even in the
   presence of middleboxes that incorrectly discard or normalise packets
   that have the reserved control flag set.

Internet-Draft          Reusing the IPv4 ID Field             March 2012


Intended status: Standards Track? (to be removed before publication)

   This draft defines a process and a protocol for enabling new
   protocols, including their progression from experimental track to
   standards track.  A process specification cannot have lesser status
   than the protocols it enables.  So if this specification were to
   start on the experimental track, it would not initially have
   sufficient status to enable standards track protocols.

   In order for the IETF to consider whether this draft itself should be
   experimental or standards track, it has been written as if it is
   intended for the standards track.  Otherwise the parts of the process
   for enabling standards track protocols would have had to have been
   written hypothetically, which would have been highly confusing.  If
   the IETF decides this specification ought to start out on the
   experimental track, the standards track parts of the process will
   have to be edited out.

   Appendix B discusses whether this draft itself would be better to
   start as experimental or standards track.

1.  Introduction

   The Problem: The extensibility provisions in IP (v4 and v6) have
   turned out not to be usable in practice.  Hardware has been optimised
   for the common case, so packets using extensibility mechanisms (e.g.
   IPv4 options or IPv6 hop-by-hop options) are very likely to be punted
   to the software slow-path and consequently likely to be dropped
   whenever the software processor is busy [Fransson04, Cisco.IPv6Ext].

   This specification takes a different approach to extensibility.
   Rather than flagging protocol extensions as 'extensions', it places
   extension headers where they will be ignored by pre-existing
   hardware.  As code is added to routers to handle newly added
   extensions, the code can tell the machine where to look for the
   relevant header.

   This approach recognises that extensions added after a protocol suite
   was first defined are different to options defined as a coherent part
   of the original protocol suite.  Machines that have no code to
   understand a protocol extension that was added later do not need to
   punt a packet to the software processor merely to scan through chains
   of headers that it will not know how to process.

   Having only settled on this approach long after the TCP/IP suite has
   been defined, it becomes necessary to find places in the existing
   protocol headers that are already ignored by existing machines.  In
   an 'atomic' IPv4 packet, the Identification (IPv4 ID) field is one

   such place that is redundant.  This specification defines the process
   through which the 16 bits in this field can be returned to the IETF
   for use in future standards actions, at least within the constraints
   imposed by their original use for reassembly.

   Background: [ipv4-id-update] proposes to update IPv4 to more closely
   match the approach taken to fragmentation in IPv6.  It recommends
   that IPv4 sources send 'atomic' packets whenever possible.  An atomic
   packet is one that has not yet been fragmented (MF=0 and fragment
   offset=0) and for which further fragmentation is inhibited (DF=1)
   [ipv4-id-update].  If fragmentation is necessary, it is only
   permitted at devices that control the uniqueness of the IP ID field,
   e.g., sources, tunnel ingresses (for the outer header), and the
   public side of NATs.

   In practical scenarios, the IPv4 ID field is too small to guarantee
   uniqueness during the lifetime of a packet anyway [RFC4963].
   Therefore it has become safer to disable fragmentation altogether and
   instead use an approach such as packetization layer path MTU
   discovery [RFC4821].  The large majority of IPv4 packets are now
   atomic.

   Approach: This specification defines the IPv4 control flag that was
   previously reserved [RFC0791] as the Recycled flag (RC).  An
   implementation can set RC=1 in an atomic packet to unambiguously flag
   that the IPv4 ID field is not to be interpreted as IP Identification,
   but instead it has the alternative semantics of an ID-Reuse field.
   By setting RC=1, IPv4 implementations can distinguish a value
   deliberately written into the ID-Reuse field from the same value that
   just happened to be written into the IP ID field of an atomic packet
   by a pre-existing implementation.

   Thus, this specification effectively uses up the last bit in the IPv4
   header in order to free up 16 other bits.  However, there are some
   constraints on the use of these 16 bits due to their original use as
   the IP ID field (enumerated in Section 5.1).  Of course the main
   constraint is that the bits are not available in non-atomic packets.
   But fragmentation is now used only rarely anyway, so it makes sense
   to see if the the Internet community can invent ways to use the 16
   bits in the IPv4 ID field despite the constraints.

   Frequently Asked Questions:

   1.  There are many cases where a non-compliant machine ignores Don't
       Fragment (DF=1) and fragments a packet anyway.

       One answer is that we cannot allow non-complaint behaviour to
       always block progress.  Another answer is that we may be able to

       detect and circumvent such non-compliant behaviour.  For
       instance, if a non-compliant router fragments packets with DF=1,
       it may be possible to enhance path maximum transmission unit
       discovery (PMTUD) to find a lower segment size small enough to
       prevent the offending box from fragmenting packets.

   2.  {ToDo}

   Document Roadmap: Section 3 defines the semantics of the updated IPv4
   wire protocol and Section 4 defines intermediate node behaviour.
   Section 5 defines the process to be used for reassigning sub-fields
   of the IPv4 ID-Reuse field.  Then Section 6 describes a way to
   circumvent problems likely to arise when deploying this new protocol.
   Finally, Section 7 enumerates the updates to pre-existing RFCs,
   before the tailpiece sections considering IANA, Security and draw
   conclusions.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Further terminology used within this document:

   Atomic packet:  A packet not yet having been fragmented (MF=0 and
      fragment offset=0) and for which further fragmentation has been
      inhibited (DF=1), or in the syntax of the C programming language
      ((DF==1) && (MF==0) && (Offset==0)) [ipv4-id-update].

   Recycled (RC) flag:  The control flag that was 'reserved' in
      [RFC0791] (Figure 1).  The flag positioned at bit 48 of the IPv4
      header (counting from 0).  Alternatively, some would call this bit
      0 (counting from 0) of octet 7 (counting from 1) of the IPv4
      header.

   ID-Reuse field:  Octets 5 and 6 (counting from 1) of the IPv4 header
      of an atomic packet (Figure 3).  The field that would have been
      the IP Identification field if the packet were not atomic.

3.  IPv4 Wire Protocol Semantics for Reusing the Identification Field

   This specification defines the control flag that was defined as
   'reserved' in [RFC0791] as the Recycled (RC) flag (Figure 1).

   If an IPv4 implementation sets RC=1 on an atomic packet, octets 5 & 6
   of the IPv4 header MUST be interpreted with the semantics of the ID-
   Reuse field, and MUST NOT be interpreted as the Identification field.
   Figure 3 shows how octets 5 & 6 are redefined as the ID-Reuse field
   when the packet is atomic, in the case where RC=1.

   The Identification Field is redefined as the ID-Reuse Field when the
                Packet is Atomic and specifically when RC=1

                Figure 3: Octets 5 to 8 of the IPv4 Header.

   If the Recycled flag is cleared to RC=0 on an atomic packet, some
   sub-fields of octets 5 & 6 of the IPv4 header MAY be interpreted with
   the semantics of the ID-Reuse field, but only in the highly
   constrained circumstances defined in Section 6.2.

   For the avoidance of doubt, the Recycled flag alone MUST NOT be
   assumed to indicate that the packet is atomic.  Only the combination
   of ((DF==1) && (MF==0) && (Offset==0)) indicates that a packet is
   atomic.  Then if the Recycled flag is also set, the ID field
   unambiguously has the semantics of the ID-Reuse field.  If the
   Recycled flag of an atomic packet is cleared, its ID field only has

   the semantics of the ID-Reuse field in specific limited
   circumstances.

   It is expected that proposals to use the ID-Reuse field will each
   need a few bits, not the whole 16 bit field.  Therefore this
   specification establishes a new IANA registry (Section 8) to record
   assignments of sub-divisions of the ID-Reuse field.  In this way, it
   will be possible for new uses of different sub-divisions to be
   orthogonal to each other.  The process for incrementally defining new
   sub-divisions is specified in Section 5.

   If an IPv4 packet header has RC=1 but it is not atomic ((DF==0) ||
   (MF==1) || (Offset !=0)), then all the fields of the IPv4 header are
   undefined and reserved for future use.  If an implementation receives
   such a packet, it could imply:

   o  that some currently unknown attack is being attempted

   o  or that some future standards action has defined a meaning for
      this reserved combination of header values

   Therefore, if an implementation receives a non-atomic packets with
   RC=1, it MUST treat the packet as if the Recycled flag were cleared
   to 0, but it MUST NOT change the Recycled flag to zero.  It MAY log
   the arrival of such packets and/or raise an alarm.  It MUST NOT
   always drop such packets, but it MAY drop them under a policy that
   can be revoked if it is established that the appearance of such
   packets is the result of a future standards action.

   For convenience only, the above rules are summarised in Table 1.  The
   semantics of octets 5 & 6 of the IPv4 header are tabulated for each
   value of the RC flag (rows) and for whether the packet is atomic or
   not (columns).

4.  Behaviour of Intermediate Nodes

4.1.  End-to-End Preservation of ID-Reuse Semantics

   If the source sets the RC flag to 1 on an atomic packet, another node
   MUST NOT clear the RC flag to zero.  Otherwise the semantics of the
   ID-Reuse field would change (see the Security Considerations in
   Section 9 for discussion of the integrity of the ID-Reuse field).
   Note that intermediate nodes are already not expected to change an
   atomic packet to non-atomic, which otherwise would also risk changing
   the semantics of the ID-Reuse field.

   If the source zeros the RC flag on an atomic packet, an intermediate
   node MAY change the RC flag to 1.  At this time, no case is envisaged
   where an intermediate node would need to do this.  However, as this
   behaviour preserves ID-Reuse semantics safely, it is not precluded in
   case it will prove useful (e.g. for sender proxies).

4.2.  Tunnel Behaviour

   This specification does not need to change the following aspects of
   IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnelling, which already provide the most useful
   semantics for the ID-Reuse field:

   o  For some time, it has been mandated that an atomic packet "MUST"
      be encapsulated by an atomic outer header [RFC2003] (although some
      implementations are broken in this respect).

   o  On decapsulation the outgoing header will naturally propagate the
      ID-Reuse field of the inner header.

   However, compliant IPv4 encapsulation implementations SHOULD copy the
   ID-Reuse field when encapsulating an atomic IPv4 packet in another
   atomic IPv4 header, irrespective of the setting of the Recycled flag.
   It would be ideal but impractical to assert 'MUST' in this last
   clause, given it cannot be assumed that pre-existing IPv4-in-IPv4
   encapsulators will propagate the ID-Reuse field to the outer header
   (see Section 5.1).

   IPv6 packets without a fragmentation extension header are inherently
   atomic.  Therefore, if an IPv4 header encapsulates an IPv6 packet,
   the encapsulator is already required to set the outer as atomic.

   There is no direct mapping between the IPv4 ID-Reuse field as a whole
   and any IPv6 header field (main or extension), because the ID-Reuse
   field is merely a container for yet-to-be-defined sub-fields.
   However, sub-fields of the ID-Reuse field might be defined to provide
   a mapping for IPv6 extension headers that need to be visible in the

   outer IPv4 header of a tunnel.  The present specification cannot say
   anything in general about any such mappings or any associated tunnel
   behaviour.  Any such behaviour will have to be defined when
   individual ID-Reuse sub-fields are specified.

5.  Process for Defining Subdivisions of the ID-Reuse Field

   When IPv4 was designed, then later IPv6, all the fields in the main
   IP header were initially defined together in a coordinated fashion.
   In contrast, the only practical way to define new uses for the bits
   in the ID-Reuse field will be to adopt a gradual addition approach,
   in which subsets of the bits or codepoints will have to be assigned
   on the merits of each request at the time.

   Each new scheme will need to submit an RFC that requests a
   subdivision of the ID-Reuse field and assigns behaviours to the
   codepoints within this subdivision.  A specification defining a new
   use of a subdivision of the ID-Reuse field MUST register this use
   with the IANA, which will maintain a registry for this purpose
   (Section 8).

   Proposals to reuse the IP ID field could relate to other parts of the
   IPv4 header in the following different ways {ToDo: this list is not
   exhaustive}:

   Orthogonal:  Some new protocol proposals will need to apply whatever
      is in the rest of the packet, e.g. whether unicast or multicast,
      whatever the Diffserv codepoint and whatever else might have been
      added in the rest of the IP-Reuse field.  Schemes that need to be
      orthogonal to other elements of the IPv4 protocol will require
      assignment of a number of bits as a dedicated sub-field of the ID-
      Reuse field.

   Mutually exclusive:  It might be impossible for two uses of the ID-
      Reuse field to both apply to the same packet.  Such mutually
      exclusive schemes will only each require a range of codepoints
      within a sub-field.

   Conditional:  Some protocol proposals might only apply when other
      parts of the header satisfy certain conditions, e.g. only for
      multicast packets.  The IANA will need to register these
      conditions so that the bits can still be assigned for other uses
      when the conditions do not apply.

   To allow interworking between sub-fields that are being defined
   incrementally, every new protocol MUST assign the all-zeros codepoint
   of its sub-field to mean the new protocol is 'turned off'.  This
   means that implementations of the new protocol will treat such

   packets as they would have been treated before the new protocol was
   defined.

   Implementations MUST also clear to zero any bits in the ID-Reuse
   field that are not defined at the time the implementation is coded.

   Proposals to use sub-fields of ID-Reuse will have to be assessed in
   the order they arrive without knowing what future proposals they
   might preclude.  To judge each proposal, at least the following
   criteria will be used:

   Constraint satisfaction:  Each proposal MUST either satisfy all the
      constraints in Section 5.1 below, or include measures to
      circumvent them.

   General usefulness:  Proposals that are not applicable to a broad set
      of services that can be built over the internetwork protocol
      SHOULD NOT warrant consuming the newly freed up IPv4 header space.

   Parsimony:  Burning up a large proportion of the remaining bits will
      count against a proposal.

   Backward compatibility with prior uses of ID-Reuse:   As more sub-
      fields of the ID-Reuse field become defined, each new proposal
      SHOULD ensure that it takes into account potential interactions
      with earlier standards actions or experiments defining other sub-
      fields.

   Forward compatibility with potential uses of ID-Reuse:   In addition,
      proposals that demonstrate sensitivity to potential future uses of
      the remaining sub-fields of the ID-Reuse field will be more likely
      to progress through the IETF's approval process.

   Do no harm:  Proposals that do no harm to existing uses of the
      Internet will be favoured over those that do more harm.

5.1.  Constraints on Uses of the ID-Reuse Field

   Atomic packets:  The IPv4 ID field cannot be reused if the packet is
      not atomic, because then the IP ID field will need to be used for
      its original purpose: fragment reassembly.

   IPsec interaction:  The IP Authentication Header (AH) [RFC4302]
      assumes and requires the IPv4 ID field to be immutable, otherwise
      verification of authentication and integrity checks will fail.
      Any new use of bits in the ID-Reuse field MUST ensure the bits are
      immutable, at least between IPsec endpoints (whether transport or
      tunnel mode).  It cannot be assumed that pre-existing IPsec

Internet-Draft          Reusing the IPv4 ID Field             March 2012


      implementations will check the setting of the Recycled flag.

      Note that the Recycled flag itself is considered mutable and
      masked out before calculating an authentication header [RFC4302]
      (see Section 9).

   Tunnelling:  Any new use of the ID-Reuse field in atomic packets
      cannot reliably assume that the ID-Reuse field will propagate
      unchanged into the outer header of an IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnel
      [RFC2003, RFC4301].  It is likely that an IPv4 tunnel ingress will
      encapsulate an atomic packet with another atomic outer header, as
      this behaviour was mandated in [RFC2003].  However it is known
      that some implementations are broken in this respect.  It is
      possible that an IPv4 encapsulator might copy the IP ID field of
      an arriving atomic packet into the outer header.  However this
      behaviour has never been required and therefore cannot be
      guaranteed for pre-existing tunnels.

      Nonetheless, it can be assumed that the IPv4 ID field will be
      preserved through the inner header into the outgoing packet at the
      other end of the tunnel (even though this behaviour would not
      strictly have been necessary for an atomic packet).

   Incremental deployment:   Each new proposal will need to consider any
      detrimental effects from pre-existing IPv4 implementations,
      assuming that they are likely to act on atomic packets without
      first checking on the setting of the Recycled flag.

5.2.  Process Example

   For illustration purposes, imagine two RFCs have been published: an
   experimental track RFC called Experiment A (ExA) and a standards
   track RFC called Standard B (StB) and .  Imagine they define
   respectively a use for bits bits 14 to 15 and 11 to 13 of the ID-
   Reuse field.  Figure 4 shows example IANA registry entries for these
   imaginary sub-fields.

   The bits shown in each row of Figure 5 define the semantics of the
   bits shown in the next row down, as follows:

   o  The top row identifies that the packet is atomic and the RC flag
      is 1.  Therefore octets 5 & 6 of the IPv4 header are redefined as
      the ID-Reuse field.

   o  The middle row shows the bits assigned to Standard B and
      Experiment A by IANA.  An implementer has to ensure that all the
      bits of the ID-Reuse field that are yet to be defined (bits 0-10)
      are cleared to zero.

   o  The bottom row shows that an implementation of ExA has set its
      2-bit sub-field to codepoint 01 and an implementation of StB has
      set its 3-bit sub-field to codepoint 101.  The meaning of each
      would be defined in the RFCs for ExA and StB respectively.

   Imagine now that Experiment C (ExC) is defined later to use bits 0-7
   of the ID-Reuse field.  If the packet in Figure 5 is received by an
   implementation of ExC, then it will see only zeros in the ExC sub-
   field.  Therefore the implementation of ExC will treat the packet as
   if ExC is turned off (as mandated in Section 5).

Internet-Draft          Reusing the IPv4 ID Field             March 2012


   Similarly, the implementation of protocol StB can rely on being able
   to turn off Experiment A by setting bits 14 & 15 to zero.

6.  Incremental Deployment of New Uses of the IPv4 ID Field

   When implementations first set the Recycled flag to 1, they are
   likely to be blocked by certain middleboxes, either deliberately
   (e.g. firewalls that assume anomalies are attacks) or erroneously
   (e.g. having misunderstood the phrase "reserved, must be zero" in
   RFC791).  It is also possible that broken 'normalisers' might clear
   RC to zero if it is 1, although so far no tests have found such
   broken behaviour.

   To address this problem, Section 6.2 introduces a way to use a sub-
   field of ID-Reuse without having to set RC=1.  In this approach,
   packet headers using the new protocol will be indistinguishable from
   an IPv4 header not using the new protocol.  Therefore it will be
   possible to guarantee that middleboxes will not treat packets using
   the new protocol any differently from other IPv4 packets.

   Many pre-existing IPv4 hosts cycle through all the values in the IP
   ID field even when sending atomic packets in which the IP ID field
   has no function.  Therefore, these pre-existing IPv4 hosts will
   occasionally issue a packet that happens to look as if it is using a
   codepoint of a new protocol using the IP ID field.  Without RC=1,
   there will be no way to distinguish the two.

      Table 2: Tradeoff between deterministic middlebox traversal and
                    deterministic protocol recognition

   Table 2 shows the tradeoff between using RC=0 or RC=1:

   RC=0:  If an implementation of a new protocol uses RC=0, its packets
      will traverse middleboxes, but it will suffer a small fraction of
      false positives when recognising which packets using the new
      protocol -- occasionally it will mistakenly assume a packet is
      using the new protocol when it is actually just random noise in
      the IP ID field from a pre-existing implementation.

Internet-Draft          Reusing the IPv4 ID Field             March 2012


   RC=1:  If an implementation of a new protocol uses RC=1, its packets
      may be black-holed by some middleboxes, but it will be certain
      which packets use the new protocol and which don't.

   Nonetheless, a probabilistic protocol that can be deployed may be
   more useful than a deterministic protocol that cannot.

6.1.  Process Example with RC=0

   Figure 6 shows an example of how this approach would work with RC=0.
   For illustration purposes imagine, as in the previous example in
   Section 5.2, that an experimental track RFC has been published called
   Experiment A (ExA) that defines bits 14 to 15 of the ID-Reuse field
   for atomic packets with RC=1.  Now imagine another experimental track
   RFC has been published called Experiment B (ExB) that defines a use
   for bits 11 to 13 of the ID-Reuse field, but does not require RC=1.
   In fact a packet is defined as complying with ExB whether RC=1 or
   RC=0 (i.e., RC=X, where 'X' means don't care).  Figure 7 shows the
   IANA registry entries for these imaginary sub-fields.

      Figure 6: Example of Experimental Reuse of Octets 5 & 6 Without
                              Requiring RC=1

   The bits shown in each row of Figure 6 define the semantics of the
   bits shown in the next row down, as follows:

   o  The top row identifies that the packet is atomic.  The RC flag is
      don't care ('X'), so RC does not have to be 1.  Implementations
      can clear RC to 0 to traverse awkward middleboxes, but RC can be
      set to 1 otherwise.

   o  The middle row shows that an implementation of Experiment B (ExB)
      has set RC=0.  It is also using the ID-Reuse field, so it clears
      all the bits to zero except those in its own sub-field (bits
      11-13).  It will have registered this experimental use with the
      IANA as shown in the top example of Figure 7.

   o  The bottom row shows that an implementation of ExB has set its
      3-bit sub-field to codepoint 101, the meaning of which will have
      been defined in the RFC specifying the ExB protocol.

Internet-Draft          Reusing the IPv4 ID Field             March 2012


   Note that, the process for using protocol ExB without RC=1
   (Section 6.2) precludes an implementation from using the ExA protocol
   in the same packet -- any one packet can only be part of one RC=0
   protocol at a time.

6.2.  Process for Using the ID-Reuse Field Without Requiring RC=1

   This approach SHOULD NOT be used unless the preferred approach
   (Section 5) is impractical due to middleboxes blocking packets with
   RC set to 1.

   To follow this non-preferred approach, the registration with the IANA
   MUST specify that the sub-field of ID-Reuse is defined for 'RC=X',
   meaning "don't care", that is RC may be either set or cleared (for an
   example, see the final bullet of the imaginary registration details
   in Section 8).  The RFC defining the relevant ID-Reuse sub-field MUST
   also make it clear that the sub-field is defined for either value of
   the Recycled flag (RC=X) in an atomic IPv4 packet.

   This approach will not be feasible for all protocols; only those that
   satisfy the severe constraints laid down below.  Otherwise, for
   protocols that cannot satisfy these prerequisite constraints, the
   preferred approach in Section 5 wth RC=1 will be the only option.

   Once a sub-field of the ID-Reuse field has been registered with the
   IANA, implementations of the protocol can use any of the available
   codepoints within that sub-field in atomic packets without having to
   set RC=1, if and only if the following constraints can be satisfied:

   1.  New protocol implementations MUST NOT use RC=0 unless the
       treatments associated with all the new codepoints are generally
       benign to packets not taking part in the protocol.  'Benign'
       means the new protocol SHOULD do no more harm to other packets
       than previous implementations did.  Using the term 'SHOULD'
       rather than 'MUST' does not completely rule out new protocol
       proposals that might sometimes introduce slightly more harm, but
       such proposals will need to give strong justifications

   2.  Implementations MUST clear all the other bits of the ID-Reuse
       field (except those in the new protocol's sub-field) to zero.
       Note that this is different to the approach with RC=1, where more
       than one sub-field at once can be non-zero

   3.  In addition the constraints in Section 5.1 must also be
       satisfied.

   Constraint #1 is severe but necessary in order to ensure that a new
   protocol (e.g.  ExB) does not harm atomic packets from pre-existing



Briscoe                Expires September 13, 2012              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          Reusing the IPv4 ID Field             March 2012


   IPv4 implementations.  For example, a receiving implementation of ExB
   can assume that most packets with all zeros in bits 0-10 and 14-15
   were deliberately set by another implementation of ExB.  But many
   pre-existing implementations of IPv4 will be cycling (sequentially or
   randomly) through all the IPID values as they send out packets.
   Occasionally they will send out a packet that happens to look like it
   complies with protocol ExB.  For the case of ExB with a 3-bit sub-
   field, such false positives will occur with probability 1 in 2^13
   (~0.01%).  We term this the misrecognition probability.

   If the new protocol were designed to do harm (e.g. to deprioritise
   certain packets against others) that would be fine for those packets
   intended to take part in the new protocol.  But it would not be
   acceptable to harm even a small proportion of packets misrecognised
   as using the new protocol.  This is why the RC=0 approach can only be
   allowed for a new protocol that is generally benign.

   Constraint #2 is necessary in order to ensure the misrecognition
   probability remains low.  If only one sub-field is allowed at one
   time, all the other bits in the ID-Reuse field will have to be zero.
   This ensures that a pre-existing IPv4 implementation cycling through
   all the IP ID values will collide less frequently with values used
   for each new protocol.

   As already stated (Section 5), each new protocol MUST define the all-
   zeros codepoint of its sub-field to mean that the new protocol is
   'turned off'.

   This arrangement ensures that packets with an IPv4 ID of zero will
   never collide with a codepoint used by any ID-Reuse scheme, whether
   RC=0 or RC=1.  All zeros was deliberately chosen as the common
   'turned off' codepoint because some pre-existing implementations have
   used zero as the default IP ID for atomic packets.

   In either case, whether the Recycled flag is set or not, a sub-field
   of the ID-Reuse field MUST be registered with the IANA, initially for
   experimental use, by referencing the relevant experimental track RFC.
   This will ensure that experiments with different sub-fields of the
   ID-Reuse field can proceed in parallel on the public Internet without
   colliding with each other.  The referenced RFC MUST define a coherent
   process for returning the bits for other uses if the experimental
   approach does not progress to the standards track.

   The same sub-field can be used with the same semantics as the
   experiment progresses, initially with the Recycled flag cleared to 0
   and later set to 1.  And the same protocol semantics can be used
   whether the proposal is experimental or standards track.  Thus, the
   whole process is designed to:

   1.  allow initial experiments to use RC=0 to traverse non-compliant
       middleboxes (Section 6);

   2.  then, once sufficient middleboxes forward RC=1 packets, the
       experiment can either be continued with RC=1 (Section 5);

   3.  or the experiment can progress cleanly to the standards track,
       while still using the same sub-field but with RC=1;

   4.  or the experiment can be terminated without having wasted any
       header bits.

   (Step 1 is only feasible if the extra constraints in Section 6.2 can
   be satisfied.  If not, Step 2 will be the only feasible first step.)

   For the avoidance of doubt, any use of ID-Reuse, whether experimental
   or not, is also subject to the general constraints already enumerated
   in Section 5.1.

7.  Updates to Existing RFCs

   Great care has been taken to ensure all the updates defined in this
   specifications are incrementally deployable.

   The definition of the RC flag in Section 3 updates the status of this
   flag that was "reserved, must be zero" in [RFC0791].  The
   redefinition of the IP Identification field as the ID-Reuse field
   when an IPv4 packet is atomic also updates RFC791.

   Updates to existing RFC791 implementations are only REQUIRED if they
   discard IPv4 packets with RC=1, or change RC from 1 to 0, both of
   which are misinterpretations of RFC791 anyway.  Otherwise, there will
   be no need to update an RFC791-compliant IPv4 stack until new use(s)
   for the ID-Reuse field are also specified.

   The recommendation in Section 4.2 to copy the ID-Reuse field when
   encapsulating an atomic IPv4 packet with another atomic IPv4 header
   updates IPv4-in-IPv4 encapsulation specifications [RFC2003]
   [RFC4301].  These updates to tunnels are likely to be recommended
   rather than essential for interworking, so they can be implemented as
   part of routine code maintenance.

   The ability to redefine the IPv4 ID field of an atomic packet updates
   [ipv4-id-update], which states "The IP ID is not defined if the
   packet (datagram) is atomic".  Nonetheless, octets 5 & 6 of an atomic
   packet still MUST NOT be interpreted with the semantics of the
   Identification field.

Internet-Draft          Reusing the IPv4 ID Field             March 2012


   [RFC2780] provides the IANA with guidelines on allocating values in
   IP and related headers.  The process defined in Section 5 and
   Section 6 update RFC2780, given ID-Reuse is effectively a new field
   in the IPv4 header.

   [RFC4727] defines the processes for experimental use of values in
   fields in the IP header that are managed by the IANA.  The processes
   defined in Section 5 and Section 6 update RFC4727 to include the new
   alternative use of the IPv4 ID field as an ID-Reuse field.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to establish a new registry to record
   allocation of sub-divisions of the ID-Reuse field and to avoid
   duplicate allocations.  The ID-Reuse field is an alternative use of
   the Identification field of the IPv4 header in atomic packets
   (Section 3).  All 16 bits are available for assignment, either as
   sub-fields of bits or as sets of codepoints within a sub-field of
   bits.  Each sub-division of the ID-Reuse field MUST be allocated
   through an IETF Consensus action.  The registry MUST then record:

   Protocol name:  the name for the protocol, as used in the RFC

9.  Security Considerations

   Integrity Checking:  This specification make the semantics of octets
      5 & 6 of the IPv4 header (IP ID or ID-Reuse) depend on the setting
      of octets 7 & 8 (all the Control Flags and the Fragment Offset
      field).  The IP Authentication Header (AH) [RFC4302] covers octets
      5 & 6 but not octets 7 & 8.  Therefore AH can assure the integrity
      of the bits in the ID-Reuse field, but it cannot verify whether or
      not the sender intended those bits to have the semantics of an ID-
      Reuse field.

      Any security-sensitive application of the ID-Reuse field will
      therefore need to provide its own integrity checking of the status
      of the Control Flags and Fragment Offset.  Such a facility would
      need to take into account that the present specification allows an
      intermediate node to set the Recycled flag, but not to clear it
      (Section 4.1).

   Covert channels:  It has always been possible to use bit 48 of the
      IPv4 header for a 1 bit per packet covert channel, for instance
      between a network protected by IPsec and an unprotected network.
      Bit 48 could be covertly toggled to pass messages because it had
      no function (so no-one would notice any affect on the main
      communication channel) and it was not covered by IPsec
      authentication.  On the other hand, once alerted to the
      vulnerability, it has always been easy for an IPsec gateway to
      spot bit 48 being used as a covert channel, given bit 48 was meant
      to always be zero.

      Now that bit 48 has been given a function, it will often no longer
      be possible for an attacker to toggle it without affecting the
      main data communication.  However, whenever the main communication

      does not depend on bit 48, it will be easier to for an attacker to
      toggle it covertly given it will no longer stand out as anomalous
      behaviour.

10.  Conclusions

   This specification builds on recent moves to make the approach to
   fragmentation in IPv4 more closely match that of IPv6.  Already the
   fields that support fragmentation in the IPv4 header are usually
   redundant, but unfortunately they are non-optional.

   This specification makes it possible to reuse the 16 bits of the IPv4
   ID field when they are not needed for reassembly.  The last unused
   bit in the IPv4 header is used in order to unambiguously flag that
   the IP ID field has new semantics.  The bit is called the Recycled
   flag, because it allows the IP ID field to be recycled for new
   purposes when it would otherwise be redundant.  Whenever the IP ID
   field has new semantics, it is termed the ID-Reuse field.

   The process for redefining the semantics of sub-fields of this ID-
   Reuse field has been laid down, both for experimental and standards
   actions.  Great care has been taken throughout to ease incremental
   deployment.  The same sub-field can be used with the same semantics
   as an experiment evolves into a standards action.  Initially it is
   even possible for certain experiments to leave the Recycled flag
   cleared to zero, in order to traverse any awkward middleboxes that
   incorrectly discard or normalise packets if the Recycled flag is set.

Appendix A.  Why More Bits Cannot be Freed (To be Removed by RFC Editor)

   Given this specification uses the last unassigned bit in the IPv4
   header, it is worth checking whether it can be used to flag a new use
   for more than the 16 bits in the IP ID field of atomic packets.

   IHL:  Ideally, the Internet header length field (4 bits) could be
      made redundant if the length of those IPv4 headers with bit 48 set
      were redefined to be fixed at 20 octets.  Then a similar approach
      to IPv6 could be taken with the Protocol field redefined as a Next
      Header field and each extension header specifying its own length.

      Unfortunately, although IPv4 options are rarely used and generally
      ignored, this idea would not be incrementally deployable.  There
      are probably billions of pre-existing implementations of the IPv4
      stack that will use the IHL field to find the transport protocol
      header, without ever looking at bit 48.  If the IHL field were
      given any other semantics conditional on bit 48 being set, all
      these pre-existing stacks would break.

   Header Checksum:  Ideally, the Header Checksum (16 bits) could be
      made redundant in those IPv4 headers with bit 48 set.  Then a
      similar approach to IPv6 could be taken where the integrity of the
      IP header relies on the end-to-end checksum of the transport
      protocol, which includes the main fields in the IP header.

      Unfortunately, again, this idea would not be incrementally
      deployable.  Pre-existing implementations of the IPv4 stack might
      verify the header checksum without ever looking at bit 48.  And
      anyway IPv4 stacks on probably every pre-existing router
      implementation would update the checksum field without knowing to
      check whether bit 48 was set.  Therefore if the field were used
      for any other purpose than a checksum, it would be impossible to
      predict how its value might be changed by a combination of pre-
      existing and new stacks.

   It is clear that reusing fields other than the IPv4 ID would be
   fraught with incremental deployment problems.  The reason the IPv4 ID
   field can be reused, is that an atomic packet already does not need

   an Identification field, whether bit 48 is set or not.  Setting bit
   48 merely allows new implementations that understand ID-Reuse
   semantics to be certain the value in the ID-Reuse field was not
   written by an implementation that intended it to have Identification
   semantics.

Appendix B.  Experimental or Standards Track? (To Be Removed Before
             Publication)

   This document defines a protocol (using the Recycled flag) to enable
   other protocols (using the ID-Reuse field).  The Recycled flag
   protocol is currently written as if it is on the IETF standards
   track.  Nonetheless it might be feasible to write it for the
   experimental track.  This appendix discusses the pros and cons of
   each.

   The Recycled flag uses up the last unused bit in the IPv4 header.
   The present specification defines a use for this last bit in the
   expectation that the Internet community will find ingeneous new
   use(s) for sub-fields of the ID-Reuse field, because then the
   Recycled flag will be needed to unambiguously indicate the new
   semantics.  However, there is a risk that the last IPv4 header bit
   could be wasted, if no new uses for the IP ID field can be found
   within the constraints of its previous use for fragment reassembly,
   or if new experimental uses are proposed but none successfully
   proceed through to standards actions.

   The risk of wasting the last bit would be mitigated if the definition
   of the Recycled flag itself was initially on the experimental track.
   Then, if some experimental use(s) of the ID-Reuse field did see
   widespread adoption, the RC flag protocol could progress to the
   standards track.  On the other hand, if no ID-Reuse experiments
   happened, the RC flag could possibly be reclaimed for another use in
   the future.  This would require all experiments with the RC flag to
   be confined in time, so that stray implementations of old experiments
   would not conflict with future uses of the flag.

   Eventually, each specification for each sub-field of ID-Reuse might
   either progress on the experimental track or standards track.
   However, an enabler for standards track specifications cannot itself
   only be experimental.  Therefore the RC flag protocol would have to
   be on the standards track, to enable standards track protocols as
   well as experimental.  Figure 8 illustrates this need for the RC flag
   protocol to have sufficient rank for any protocols it enables.

   Figure 8: Validity of Combinations of IETF tracks for the RC flag and
                           an ID-Reuse Subfield

   One purpose of the present draft is to outline how new uses of ID-
   Reuse sub-fields can progress seamlessly from experimental track to
   standards track.  Therefore, this draft is written as if it were on
   the standards track.  Otherwise the processes for enabling standards
   track documents would have had to be written hypothetically, which
   would have been highly confusing.  Nonetheless, no intent to prejudge
   that this document should be or will be on the standards track is
   implied.

   If it were decided that the present draft should start on the
   experimental track, all the text about enabling standards track
   protocols would have to be edited out, or perhaps moved to a non-
   normative appendix.

   Alternatively, the IETF might see some obvious new uses for sub-
   fields of the ID-Reuse field that would make it reasonable to fast-
   track the RC flag straight onto the standards track.
