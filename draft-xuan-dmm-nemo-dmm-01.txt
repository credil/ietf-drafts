Abstract

   Network mobility (NEMO) provides session continuity for mobile nodes
   (MN) while moving in vehicles without their involvement in signaling
   process. NEMO Basic support protocol [RFC3963] is standardized to
   provide network mobility support.

   Current mobility management protocols, such as MIPv6 [RFC6275] and
   PMIPv6 [RFC5213], rely on a central mobility anchor in order to
   provide mobility support for the mobile nodes. These centralized
   approaches show some big issues, such as a single point of failure,
   non-optimal routing, and scalability. Ever-increasing demand for the
   mobile traffic changes the network architecture from hierarchical to
   flat architecture, and distributed mobility management (DMM)
   approaches are being researched to adapt the new flat architecture
   and overcome big above issues.

   This document presents about detailed protocol operation to support
   network mobility in the DMM domain.

1. Introduction

   Network mobility (NEMO) [RFC3963] is used to provide mobilitysupport
   for a group of mobile nodes. This solution allows the mobile nodes
   to access Internet from a device called mobile router. This router
   is used to handle mobility signaling on behalf of mobile node
   attached to it. However, this approach is host-based and causes high
   signaling and packet delivery overhead.

   Some other network mobility management approaches, such as PRNEMO
   [Jeon2011] which are PMIPv6-based have been defined in the research
   groups. These approaches have some advantages over host-based
   network mobility management ones, such as not require host stack
   involvement, handover delay improvement.

   However, all of these approaches are centralized that means all
   mobility management functions are centralized at a mobility anchor.
   These centralized approaches suffer from major issues, such as a
   single point of failure, wasting network resources and scalability,
   as defined in [Chan2013]. New trend in the evolution of mobile
   network is going toward flat architecture. In the flat architecture,
   the distributed mobility management (DMM) which distributes mobility
   management functions into access networks has been proposed to
   overcome the big issues of the centralized approaches.

   This document presents about detailed protocol operation to support
   network mobility in the DMM domain. In our scheme, the proxy router
   which is responsible for handling mobility related signaling will
   cache the IDs and prefixes of the attached mobile nodes. When the
   proxy router moves from one cell to another, it will get the new
   network prefixes for all attached mobile nodes and distribute to
   each mobile node via the router advertisement messages. This allows
   our network mobility management scheme to take the advantages of
   DMM. In this document, we use partially PMIPv6-based DMM approach
   in [Seite2013] to enable network mobility support.

                   Figure 1 The attachment procedure of the PR


      When a proxy router (PR) approaches the DMM domain, the event is
   detected by the p-MAR using the Layer 2 signals. Then, the PR sends
   the router solicitation message (RS) containing the ID of the PR,
   'G' flag set to 1 toward the p-MAR. In our scheme, in order to
   distinguish between the RS messages of the PR and the mobile node
   (MN), we use the 'G' flag. The PR sends the RS message with 'G' flag
   set to 1, but the MN sends the RS message without 'G' flag. On
   receiving the RS message, the p-MAR will make an binding cache
   entry, including the ID of PR, the assigned network prefix, the
   anchor point, the 'D' flag, and the group ID. In this binding cache,
   'D' flag is used to know whether the PR or MN attach directly to the
   mobility access router (MAR) or not. All mobile nodes and its proxy
   router have the same group ID value. Then, the p-MAR performs the
   mobility session update to the central database, as defined in
   [Seite2013]. The p-MAR will assign a network prefix pref1 for the

   PR and sends it back via the RA message. After receiving the pref1,
   the PR can configure an IPv6 address.

                 Figure 2 MN attachment to the DMM domain


      When an MN attaches to the PR, it sends its ID to the PR via RS
   message. The PR will forward this RS message with 'P' and 'G' flags
   set to 1 to the p-MAR. 'P' flag means this RS is the proxy RS sent
   by the PR on behalf of the MN. 'G' flag is used to request the p-MAG
   to assign a group ID for the MN. After receiving this RS message,
   the p-MAG will assign a network prefix pref2 for the MN and assign
   the same group ID as the PR. 'D' flag is set to 0 means the MN
   attaches to the PR not the p-MAR. Then, the p-MAG sends the network
   prefix pref2 to the PR and at the same time performs session update
   to the CDB. On receiving the RA message, the PR will cache the ID
   and the prefix of the MN for later handover operation. After

   receiving the pref2, the MN can configure an IPv6 address and
   initiate and maintain the data session using this address. In this
   case, the data packets which go to the IP address pref2::MN-ID will
   be routed to the p-MAR. Then, the p-MAR will perform recursive
   lookup in its binding cache, if the anchor point for this address is
   the p-MAR, the data packets will be routed to the PR, finally to the
   MN without adding any tunnel headers.

   When the PR handovers from the p-MAR to the n-MAR, the PR will send
   a RS message, including its ID and the IDs of all attached MN to the
   n-MAR in order to request new network prefixes for the attached MNs.
   On receiving this RS message, the n-MAG will make new binding cache
   entries. When receiving a RS message with more than one ID, the n-
   MAR will consider the first ID as the ID of the PR and also assign
   the same group ID, new network prefixes: pref3, pref4. The 'D' flag
   in the entry of the first ID is set to 1 and of other IDs are set to

   0. Then, the n-MAR will query to the CDB to get the previous anchor
   points of the PR. The n-MAR will send a PBU message, containing the
   new location of the PR to the p-MAR to establish a tunnel. On
   receiving new network prefixes from the RA message, the MN also
  configure a new IP address pref4::MN-ID.

   For the data delivery operation, the data flow to the old IP address
   of the MN will be routed to the p-MAR. At the p-MAR, the data
   packets will be added two tunnel headers, the outer header is the IP
   address of the n-MAR and the inner header is the IP address of the
   PR. The data packets will be de-capsulated at the n-MAR and the PR,
   finally sent to the MN. The data flow to the new IP address of the
   MN will be routed to the currently attached anchor point, i.e. 
   n-MAR, then to the PR, finally to the MN without adding any tunnel
   headers.

      After detaching from the PR, the MN attaches to the n-MAR. The MN
   sends a RS message with 'G' flag set to 0 to the n-MAR. The n-MAR
   will update the binding cache entry for the MN. The 'D' flag for
   the binding entry of the MN set to 1 means the MN attaches directly
   to the n-MAR and the group ID will be deleted. Next steps are

   similar to the handover procedure of the PR. The n-MAR also queries
   to the central database to get previous anchor points of the MN,
   and then sends a PBU message to update the new location of the MN.
      For the packet delivery operation, the data packets to the old IP
   address of the MN will be routed to the p_MAR. At the p-MAR, data
   packets will be added one tunnel header which is the IP address
   of the n-MAR. These data packets will be de-capsulated at the n-MAR,
   and sent to the MN. For the data packets to the new IP address of
   the MN, the data packets will be routed to the n-MAR and to the MN
   without adding any tunnel headers.


3.5. Lifetime management for binding entries

      The number of binding entries in the binding caches in the MAR
   and the CDB increases with the attachment of new mobile nodes. A
   mechanism is needed to clean unused entries in these binding caches.
   There are two solutions to do this task:

   o  A lifetime value is set for each binding entry. When this
      lifetime value expires, the binding entry will be removed from
      the cache of MAR or CDB.

   o  After receiving the PBU message of the MN, the previous MAR waits
      until the data session toward the prefix assigned to the MN
      finishes. Then, the previous MAR will remove the binding entry
      related to the MN and the prefix of finished session. Then, the
      previous MAR sends a de-registration message to the CDB to remove
      the mobility session information of the MN from the binding cache
      of the CDB.

4. Considerations for fully distributed DMM

      In the fully distributed DMM, both data plane and control plane
   are processed in the MARs. The central database becomes useless in
   the full architecture. The information about mobility sessions is no
   longer stored in the central database, but is exchanged between the
   previous MAR and next MAR using control messages. Concretely, when
   the previous MAR finishes assigning prefixes for the PR or the MN,
   instead of updating these mobility sessions to the CDB, it can
   broadcast the information to its neighboring MARs. The next MAR then
   can receive this mobility session information of the PR or the MN
   without going to the CDB. The mobility session information includes
   the IP addresses of the previous MARs and the prefixes advertised to
   the PR and the MN.
