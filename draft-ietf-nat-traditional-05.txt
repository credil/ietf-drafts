Basic Network Address Translation or Basic NAT is a method by which
IP addresses are mapped from one group to another, transparent to
end users.  Network Address Port Translation, or NAPT is a method by
which many network addresses and their TCP/UDP (Transmission Control
Protocol/User Datagram Protocol) ports are translated into a single
network address and its TCP/UDP ports.  Together, these two
operations, referred to as traditional NAT, provide a mechanism to
connect a realm with private addresses to an external realm with
globally unique registered addresses.
