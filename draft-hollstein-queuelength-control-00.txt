   LDAP Queue Length Control


Status of This Memo

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification.
   It is published for examination, experimental implementation, and
   evaluation. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.



Abstract

   This document specifies a new control. The client can use it to tell
   the server the number of responses it expects for a series of
   requests that were sent in asynchronous mode. This enables the
   server to better pack usually small LDAP result messages into send
   buffers that better match the TCP maximum transfer unit. From this
   a substantial improvement in network ressource utilization, response
   time and throughput is expected.

                   LDAP Queue Length Control                   June 2013


1.  Overview

   POSIX - compatible TCP stacks use the Nagle Algorithm to achieve a
   good utilization of network packets. They try to fill a TCP packet
   completely before it is sent. On LDAP level this means that the
   client must wait for a response until the server side operating
   system decides to send the packet. Or the LDAP server employs
   TCP_NODELAY to let the system dump any message immediately on the
   wire, regardless of its size. This situation leads either to
   wait times on client side or to poor network utilization for LDAP
   response messages.

   LDAP has no protocol element to let the client tell the server
   the number of responses it expects when the requests were sent
   in asynchronous mode. This forces the server to assume that the
   client works in synchronous mode. After having received a request
   the server alternatively could of course wait for the next one
   before it sends the response for the first request. But the client
   waits at the same time for the first response, so the second request
   will not appear at the server site. In this situation the server
   could only take a decision how to proceed when the receive operation
   times out. This mechanism ruins performance and is no real option.

   With the queue length control the client can tell the server how
   many responses it expects. The server can refrain from sending
   responses until the given number of requests have been processed.
   Then it can pack all responses into a send buffer that will more
   closely match the TCP maximum transfer unit (MTU) of the operating
   system. With the exception of search results, LDAP response messages
   are usually very small (less than 20 bytes) while common operating
   system have MTUs around 1500 bytes. Still the server can set the
   TCP_NODELAY option on the socket because itself cares for optimum
   packet utilization. This optimizes both sides: Response time AND
   throughput.


1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2.  The Queue Length Control

   The control object identifier is an IANA - assigned OID. The
   criticality is always FALSE. The control value is the requested
   queue length and takes the fowllowing form:

   queue-length = INTEGER (2 ..  N)

                   LDAP Queue Length Control                   June 2013


2.1.  Client Behavior

   Clients MAY include this control in the first of a sequence of
   requests sent in asynchronous mode. The total number of requests in
   the sequence MUST be equal to the given queue-length. Clients MUST
   NOT include this control in any other request of the same sequence.
   After having sent the whole sequence Clients MUST wait for the number
   of responses given in queue-length. Clients MUST NOT use this control
   in any LDAP request type except ADD, DELETE, MODIFY, MODDN, COMPARE,
   SEARCH. In the context of this specification result messages of a
   single SEARCH request are seen as just one response, regardless how
   many objects are in the SEARCH result set.
   
 

2.2.  Server Behavior 

   In addition to the standard control semantics given in [RFC4511]
   servers supporting this control MUST behave as follows:


   - If the requested queue length exceeds server side limitations the
     control is ignored and the server operates normally. Responses
     are sent one after another as the requests in the queue are
     processed.

   - If the requested queue length is acceptable but the sequence of
     requests contain request types not allowed the control is ignored
     and the server operates normally. Responses are sent one after
     another as the requests in the queue are processed.

   - If the client sends (in violation of this specification) one or
     more queue length controls before a previous one was completely
     processed, the server ignores the additional controls and
     operates normally. The same applies for other client - side
     violations of this specification.

   - If the requested queue length is acceptable the server processes
     each request in the queue and stores the responses in a buffer.
     When the current sequence of requests have been processed, the
     servers sends the response buffer.


   Same as the client the server MUST handle the collection of result
   messages of a single SEARCH request as just one response in the
   context of the queue length control. The whole SEARCH result set
   consumes just one slot in the output queue.

3.  Interaction with other Controls

3.1. Transaction Control

   Clients MUST NOT use the queue length control in conjunction with
   the transaction control. [RFC5805] requires that servers send their
   responses immediately inside of ongoing transactions.

   Servers seeing both controls present in a LDAP request MUST ignore
   the queue length control.



4.  Security Considerations

   General security considerations [RFC4510], especially those
   associated with update operations [RFC4511], apply to this extension.



5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to assign a new object identifier for this control.
