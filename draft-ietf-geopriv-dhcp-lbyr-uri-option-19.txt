Abstract

   This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   Option for transmitting a client's geolocation Uniform Resource 
   Identifier (URI). This Location URI can then be dereferenced in a 
   separate transaction by the client or sent to another entity and 
   dereferenced to learn physically where the client is located, but 
   only while valid.

1.  Introduction

   This document creates a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   Option for transmitting a client's geolocation Uniform Resource 
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986]. In this scenario, the DHCP client is a 
   Geopriv Target (i.e., the entity whose geolocation is associated 
   with the location URI). The DHCP implementation of the client can 
   then make this location information available to other applications 
   for their usage.  This location URI points to a Location Server 
   [RFC5808] which has the geolocation of the client  (e.g., previously
   uploaded into a wiremap database then the client attaches to a known
   wall-jack, or by means of 802.11 geolocation mechanisms).  

   Applications within the Target can then choose to dereference this 
   location URI and/or transmit the URI to another entity as a means of
   conveying where the Target is located. Both Conveying and 
   Dereferencing a location URI is described in [RFC6442]. Session 
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] is not the only protocol that 
   can dereference a location URI; there is also HTTP-Enabled Location 
   Delivery (HELD) [RFC6753] and HTTP [RFC2616].

   A Location Server (LS) stores the Target's location as a presence 
   document, called a Presence Information Data Format - Location 
   Object (PIDF-LO), defined in RFC 4119 [RFC4119]. The Location Server
   is the entity contacted during the act of dereferencing a Target's 
   location.  If the dereferencing entity has permission, defined in 
   [RFC6772], the location of the target will be received.  The LS 
   will grant permission to location inquiries based on the rules 
   established by a Rule Holder [RFC3693].  The LS has the ability to 
   challenge any request for a target's location, thereby providing 
   additive security properties before location revelation.

Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Feb 2013

   Possessing a location URI has advantages over having a PIDF-LO, 
   especially when a target's location changes.  With a location URI, 
   when a target moves, the location URI does not change (at least 
   within the same domain). The location URI can still be given out as 
   the reference to the Target's current location. The opposite is true
   if the location is conveyed by value in a message. Once the Target 
   moves, the previously given location is no longer valid, and if the 
   Target wants to inform another entity about its location, it has to 
   send the PIDF-LO to the location recipient (again). 

   A problem exists within existing RFCs that provide location to the 
   UA ([RFC6225] and [RFC4776]). Those DHCP Options for geolocation 
   values require an update of the entire location information (LI) 
   every time a client moves.  Not all clients will move frequently, 
   but some will.  Refreshing location values every time a client moves
   does not scale in certain networks/environments, such as IP-based 
   cellular networks, enterprise networks or service provider networks 
   with mobile endpoints.  An 802.11 based access network is one 
   example of this. Constantly updating Location Configuration 
   Information (LCI) to endpoints might not scale in mobile 
   (residential or enterprise or municipal) networks in which the 
   client is moving through more than one network attachment point, 
   perhaps as a person walks or drives with their client down a 
   neighborhood street or apartment complex or a shopping center or 
   through a municipality (that has IP connectivity as a service). 

   If the client was provided a location URI reference to retain and 
   hand out when it wants or needs to convey its location (in a 
   protocol other than DHCP), a location URI that would not change as 
   the client's location changes (within a domain). Scaling issues 
   would be significantly reduced to needing an update of the location 
   URI only when a client changes administrative domains - which is 
   much less often.  This delivery of an indirect location has the 
   added benefit of not using up valuable or limited bandwidth to the 
   client with the constant updates.  It also relieves the client from 
   having to determine when it has moved far enough to consider asking 
   for a refresh of its location.  

   In enterprise networks, if a known location is assigned to each 
   individual Ethernet port in the network, a device that attaches to 
   the network, such as a wall-jack (directly associated with a 
   specific Ethernet Switch port) will be associated with a known 
   location via a unique circuit-ID that's used by the Relay Agent 
   Information Option (RAIO) defined in RFC 3046  [RFC3046].  This 
   assumes wall-jacks have an updated wiremap database.  RFC 6225 
   [RFC6225] and RFC 4776 [RFC4776] would return an LCI value of 
   location for either IPv4 or IPv6.  This document specifies how a 
   location URI is returned using DHCP.  The location URI points to a 
   PIDF-LO contained on an LS. Performing a dereferencing transaction, 
   that Target's PIDF-LO will be returned.  If local configuration has 
   the requirement of only assigning unique location URIs to each 
   client at the same attachment point to the network (i.e., same RJ-45

   jack or same 802.11 Access Point - except when triangulation is 
   used), then unique location URIs will be given out. They will all 
   have the same location at the record, relieving the backend Sighter 
   or LS from individually maintaining each location independently.

   The location URI Option can be useful in IEEE 802.16e connected 
   endpoints or IP cellular endpoints.  The location URI Option can be 
   configured on a router, such as a residential home gateway, such 
   that the router receives this Location URI Option as a client with 
   the ability to communicate to downstream endpoints as a server.

   How an LS responds to a dereference request can vary, and a policy 
   established by a Ruleholder [RFC3693] for a Location Target as to 
   what type of challenge(s) is to be used, how strong a challenge is 
   used or how precise the location information is given to a 
   Location Recipient (LR). This document does not provide mechanisms 
   for the LS to tell the client about policies or for the client to 
   specify a policy for the LS. While an LS should apply an appropriate
   access-control policy, clients must assume that the LS will provide 
   location in response to any request (following the possession model
   [RFC5808]).  For further discussion of privacy, see the Security 
   Considerations.

2.  Format of the DHCP LocationURI Option


2.1 Overall Format of LocationURI Option in IPv4

   The LocationURI Option format for IPv4 is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   Length=XX:    The length of this option, counted in bytes - not 
                 counting the Code and Length bytes. This is a variable
                 length Option, therefore the length value will change 
                 based on the length of the URI within the Option.

   Valid-For:    The time, in seconds, the LocationURI is to be 
                 considered valid for dereferencing. The Valid-For is 
                 always represented as a four-byte unsigned integer.

   LocationURI:  Location URI - This field, in bytes, is the URI 
                 pointing at the location record where the PIDF-LO for 
                 the Location Target resides. The LocationURI is always
                 represented in ASCII.


2.2 Overall Format of LocationURI Option in IPv6

   The LocationURI Option format for IPv6 is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

                counting the option-code and option-len bytes. This is 
                a variable length Option, therefore the length value 
                will change based on the length of the URI within the 
                Option.

2.3 Rules for the LocationURI Option

   The LocationURI Option has the following rules:

   o Implementation of the Location URI Option is REQUIRED on the DHCP
     server and client.


Polk                   Expires August 25, 2013                 [Page 5]
Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Feb 2013


   o Clients SHOULD be expected to have to request the Location URI 
     Option from servers. Although local policy can have servers 
     perform an unsolicited push of a Location URI Option to a client.

   Applications on a client can use the Location URI (value) until the 
   Valid-For value reaches zero. If there is no Valid-For Option value,
   then the counter did not ever start (a null value), and applications
   on a client continue to use the Location URI value until given a new
   Location URI Option  (with or without a Valid-For value) which 
   overwrites any previous Location URI and Valid-For Option values.

   o A Location URI Option with a non-zero Valid-For field MUST NOT 
     transmit the Location URI once the Valid-For field counts down to 
     zero.

   o A received Location URI Option containing all zeros in the 
     Valid-For field means that Location URI has no lifetime, and not 
     "no lifetime left". All zeros in the Valid-For field equates to a 
     null value.

   o Receipt of the Location URI Option containing all zeros in the 
     Valid-For field MUST NOT cause any error in handling the Location 
     URI.

   o When the Valid-For timer reaches zero, the client MUST purge any 
     location URI received via DHCP from its memory.

   The choice of the Valid-For value is a policy decision for the 
   operator of the DHCP server.  Like location URIs themselves, it can 
   be statically configured on the DHCP server or provisioned 
   dynamically (via an out-of-band exchange with a Location Information
   Server) as requests for location URIs are received.    

   o Clients receiving a Location URI Option start the Valid-For timer 
     upon receipt of the DHCP message containing the Option.

   o Clients MUST NOT trigger an automatic DHCP refresh on expiry of 
     the Valid-For timer; rather, they MUST follow normal DHCP 
     mechanics. 

   If the Valid-For timer is set to expire before the lease refresh, 
   the client will not have the ability to hand out its location until 
   the lease refresh, inadvertently allowing a gap of coverage. If the 
   Valid-For timer is set to expire after the lease refresh, some 
   wayward application on the client can divulge that location URI 
   after it is no longer valid, meaning the location could be stale or 
   just plain wrong.

   o Servers SHOULD set the Valid-For timer to that of the lease 
     refresh, or bad things can happen.

3. DHCP Option Operation

   The [RFC3046] RAIO can be utilized to provide the appropriate 
   indication to the DHCP Server where this DISCOVER or REQUEST message
   came from, in order to supply the correct response.  

   Caution SHOULD always be used involving the creation of large 
   Options, meaning that this Option may need to be in its own INFORM, 
   OPTION or ACK message. DHCP messages are limited in size, and long 
   URIs will require the use of multiple messages and concatenation 
   [RFC3396].  It is, therefore, best to limit the total length of a 
   URI, including any parameters, to 220 bytes.

   Location URIs MUST NOT reveal identity information of the user of 
   the device, since DHCP is a cleartext delivery protocol. For 
   example, creating a location URI such as

      sips:34LKJH534663J54@example.com 

   is better than a location URI such as

      sips:aliceisat123mainstatlantageorgiaus@example.com

   The username portion of the first example URI provides no direct 
   identity information (in which 34LKJH534663J54 is considered to be a
   random number in this example).

   In the <presence> element of a PIDF-LO document, there is an 
   'entity' attribute that identifies what entity *this* presence 
   document (including the associated location) refers to.  It is up to
   the PIDF-LO generator, either Location Server or an application in 
   the endpoint, to insert the identity in the 'entity' attribute.  
   This can be seen in [RFC4119].  The considerations for populating 
   the entity attribute value in a PIDF-LO document are independent 
   from the considerations for avoiding exposing identification 
   information in the username part of a location URI.

   This Option is used only for communications between a DHCP client 
   and a DHCP server.  It can be solicited (requested) by the client, 
   or it can be pushed by the server without a request for it.  DHCP 
   Options not understood MUST be ignored [RFC2131].  A DHCP server 
   supporting this Option might or might not have the location of a 
   client.  If a server does not have a client's location, but needs to
   provide this Location URI Option to a client (for whatever reason), 
   an LS is contacted.  This server-to-LS transaction is not DHCP, 
   therefore it is out of scope of this document. Note that this 
   server-to-LS transaction could delay the DHCP messaging to the 
   client. If the server fails to have location before it transmits its
   message to the client, location will not be part of that DHCP 
   message. Any timers involved here are a matter of local 
   configuration.

   The dereference of a target's location URI would not involve DHCP, 
   but an application layer protocol, such as SIP or HTTP, therefore 
   dereferencing is out of scope of this document. 

   In the case of residential gateways being DHCP servers, they usually
   perform as DHCP clients in a hierarchical fashion up into a service 
   provider's network DHCP server(s), or learn what information to 
   provide via DHCP to residential clients through a protocol, such as 
   PPP.  In these cases, the location URI would likely indicate the 
   residence's civic address to all wired or wireless clients within 
   that residence.  


4.  Architectural Assumptions

   The following assumptions are made once the client has obtained a 
   location URI, and not about DHCP operation specifics (in no 
   particular order):

   o  Any user control (what [RFC3693] calls a 'Ruleholder') for access
      to the dereferencing step is assumed to be out of scope of this 
      document. An example authorization policy is in [RFC6772].

   o  The authorization security model vs. possession security model 
      discussion can be found in [RFC5606], describing what is expected
      in each model of operation.  It should be assumed that a location
      URI attained using DHCP will operate under a possession model by
      default. An authorization model can be instituted as a matter of 
      local policy.  An authorization model means possessing the 
      location URI does not give that entity the right to view the 
      PIDF-LO of the target whose location is indicated in a presence 
      document.  The dereference transaction will be challenged by the 
      Location Server only in an authorization model.  The nature of 
      this challenge is out of scope of this document.  

   o  This document does not prevent some environments from operating 
      in an authorization model, for example - in less tightly 
      controlled networks. The costs associated with authorization vs. 
      possession models are discussed in Section 3.3.2 of [RFC5606].


4.1 Harmful URIs and URLs

   There are, in fact, some types of URIs that are not good to receive,
   due to security concerns.  For example, any URLs that can have 
   scripts, such as "data:" URLs, and some "HTTP:" URLs that go to web 
   pages that have scripts.  Therefore,

   o URIs received via this Option SHOULD NOT be automatically sent to 
     a general-browser to connect to a web page, because they could 
     have harmful scripts, unless

Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Feb 2013


     o the browser has been set up to defend against harmful scripts, 

    or

     o the browser does not run scripts automatically.

   o This Option MUST NOT contain "data:" URLs [RFC2397], because they 
     could contain harmful scripts.


4.2  Valid Location URI Schemes or Types

   URIs carried by this DHCP Option MUST have one of the following URI 
   schemes:

   1. sip:
   2. sips:
   3. pres:
   4. http:
   5. https:

   URIs using the "pres" scheme are dereferenced using the presence 
   event package for SIP [RFC3856], so they will reference a PIDF-LO 
   document when location is available.  Responses to requests for URIs
   with other schemes ("sip", "sips", "http", and "https") MUST have 
   media type 'application/pidf+xml'[RFC4119].  Alternatively, HTTP and 
   HTTPS URIs MAY refer to information with media type 
   'application/held+xml', in order to support HELD dereferencing 
   [RFC6753].  Clients can indicate which media types they support 
   using the "Accept" header field in SIP [RFC3261] or HTTP [RFC2616].

   See RFC 3922 [RFC3922] for using the "pres:" URI with XMPP.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers follow Section 4.6 of RFC 6442 
   [RFC6442] as guidance regarding which Location URI schemes to 
   provide in DHCP. That document discusses what a receiving entity 
   does when receiving a URI scheme that is not understood. Awareness 
   to the two URI types there is important for conveying location, if 
   SIP is used to convey a Location URI provided by DHCP.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1 The IPv4 Option number for the Location URI Option

   This document IANA registers the DHCP Location URI Option Number in 
   the BOOTP Vendor Extensions and DHCP Options subregistry of the 
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Bootstrap Protocol 
   (BOOTP) Parameters registry located.

5.3 Valid Location URI Schemes 

   This document creates a new IANA registry (Valid Location URI 
   Schemes) of acceptable location URI schemes (or types) for this DHCP
   Location URI Option of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
   (DHCP) and Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) Parameters registry.

   Initial values are given below; new assignments are to be made
   following the "IETF Review" policies [RFC5226].

6.  Security Considerations

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this 
   location URI option, DHCP authentication as defined in 
   "Authentication for DHCP Messages" [RFC3118] and "Dynamic Host 
   Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)" [RFC3315] SHOULD be used 
   to protect the integrity of the DHCP options. 


Polk                   Expires August 25, 2013                [Page 10]
Internet-Draft     Geopriv DHCP Location URI Option            Feb 2013


   A real concern with RFC 3118 or RFC 3315 is that neither is widely 
   deployed because each requires pre-shared keys to successfully work 
   (i.e., in the client and in the server).  Most implementations do 
   not accommodate this.

   DHCP, initially, is a broadcast request (a client looking for a 
   server), and a unicast response (answer from a server) type of 
   protocol.  There is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an 
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the DHCP server and 
   requesting client can discover the Location URI.  

   Once a client has a Location URI, it needs information on how the 
   location server will control access to dereference requests.  A 
   client might treat a tightly access-controlled URI differently from 
   one that can be dereferenced by anyone on the Internet (i.e., one 
   following the "possession model").  Since the client does not know 
   what policy will be applied during this validity interval, clients 
   MUST handle location URIs as if they could be dereferenced by 
   anybody until they expire.  For example, such open location URIs 
   should only be transmitted in encrypted channels.  Nonetheless, 
   location servers SHOULD apply appropriate access control policies, 
   for example by limiting the number of queries that any given client 
   can make, or limiting access to users within an enterprise.  

   Extensions to this option, such as [ID-POLICY-URI] can provide 
   mechanisms for accessing and provisioning policy.  Giving users 
   access to policy information will allow them to make more informed 
   decisions about how to use their location URIs.  Allowing users to 
   provide policy information to the LS will enable them to tailor 
   access control policies to their needs (within the bounds of policy 
   that the LS will accept).

   As to the concerns about the location URI itself, as stated in the 
   document (see Section 3), it MUST NOT have any user identifying 
   information in the URI user-part/string itself.  The location URI 
   also needs to be hard to guess that it belongs to a specific user.  

   In some cases a DHCP server may be implemented across an 
   uncontrolled network.  In those cases, it would be appropriate for a
   network administrator to perform a threat analysis (see RFC 3552) 
   and take precautions as needed.

   Link-layer confidentiality and integrity protection may also be 
   employed to reduce the risk of location disclosure and tampering.
