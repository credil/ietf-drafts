                   draft-ietf-fecframe-pseudo-cdp-03

Abstract

   This document provides a pseudo Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) to
   protect multiple source flows with one or more repair flows based on
   the FEC Framework and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) elements
   defined for the framework.  The purpose of the document is not to
   provide a full-pledged protocol, but to show how the defined
   framework and SDP elements can be combined together to design a CDP.

Internet-Draft    Pseudo CDP for Multiple Source Flows          May 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework (described in [RFC6363])
   and SDP Elements for FEC Framework (described in [RFC6364]) together
   define mechanisms sufficient enough to build an actual Content
   Delivery Protocol (CDP) with FEC protection.  Methods to convey FEC
   Framework Configuration Information (described in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-config-signaling]) on the other hand provides the
   signaling protocols that may be used as part of CDP to communicate
   FEC Scheme-Specific Information from FEC sender to a single as well
   as multiple FEC receivers.  This document aims at providing a
   guideline on how the mechanisms defined in [RFC6363] and [RFC6364]
   can be sufficiently used to design a CDP over a non-trivial scenario,
   namely protection of multiple source flows with one or more repair
   flows.

   In particular, we provide clarifications and descriptions on how:

   o  source and repair flows may be uniquely identified,

   o  source blocks may be generated from one or more source flows,

   o  repair flows may be paired with the source flows,

   o  the receiver explicitly and implicitly identifies individual
      flows,

   o  source blocks are regenerated at the receiver and the missing
      source symbols in a source block are recovered.


2.  Definitions/Abbreviations

   This document uses all the definitions and abbreviations from Section
   2 of [RFC6363].


3.  Construction of a Repair Flow from Multiple Source Flows

   At the sender side, CDP constructs the source blocks (SB) by
   multiplexing transport payloads from multiple flows (See Figure 1 and
   Figure 2).  According to the FEC Framework, each source block is FEC-
   protected separately.  Each source block is given to the specific FEC
   encoder used within the CDP as input and as the outputs Explicit
   Source FEC Payload ID, Repair FEC Payload ID, and Repair Payloads
   corresponding to that source block are generated.  Note that Explicit
   Source FEC payload ID is optional and if CDP has implicit means of
   constructing the source block at the sender/receiver (e.g., by using

   FEC payload ID might not be output.

            Figure 1: Source Block generation for an FEC scheme

   Figure 2 shows the structure of a source block.  A CDP must clearly
   specify which payload corresponds to which source flow and the length
   of each payload.

                   Figure 2: Structure of a Source Block

   Flow ID (FID) value provides a unique short-hand identifier for the
   source flows.  FID is specified and associated with the possibly
   wildcarded tuple of {source IP address, source port, destination IP
   address, destination port, transport protocol} in the SDP
   description.  When wildcarded, certain fields in the tuple are not
   needed for distinguishing the source flows.  The tuple is carried in
   the IP and transport headers of the source packets.  Since FID is
   utilized by the CDP and FEC scheme to distinguish between the source
   packets, the tuple must have a one-to-one mapping to a valid FID.
   This point will be clearer in the specific example given later in
   this section.  The length of FID must be a priori fixed and known to
   both the receiver and sender.  Alternatively, it might be specified
   in the FEC-Scheme-Specific Information field in the SDP element
   [RFC6364].

   The payload length (Len) information is needed to figure out how many
   bits, bytes, or symbols (depending on the FEC scheme) from a
   particular source flow are included in the source block.  If the
   payload is not an integer multiple of the specified symbol length,

                 Figure 4: Repair flow payload generation

   FEC schemes typically expect a source block of certain size, say m
   symbols.  Therefore, the FEC encoder divides each source block into m
   symbols (with some padding if the source block is shorter than the
   expected m symbols) and generates u repair symbols which are
   functions of the m symbols in the original source block.  The repair
   symbols are grouped by the FEC scheme into repair payloads with each
   repair payload assigned a Repair FEC Payload ID in order to associate
   each repair payload with a particular source block at the receiver.
   If the payloads in a given source block have sequence numbers that
   can uniquely specify their location in the source block, an Explicit
   Source FEC Payload ID may not be generated for these payloads.
   Otherwise, Explicit Source FEC Payload IDs are generated for each
   payload and indicate the order the payloads appear in the source
   block.

   Note that FID and length information are not actually transmitted
   with the source payloads since both information can be gathered by
   other means as it will be clear in the next sections.

3.1.  Example: Two Source Flows Protected by a Single Repair Flow

   In this section, we present an example of source flow and repair flow
   generation by the CDP.  We have two source flows with flow IDs of 0
   and 1 to be protected by a single repair flow (See Figure 5).  The
   first source flow is multicast to 233.252.0.1 and the second source
   flow is multicast to 233.252.0.2.  Both flows use the port number
   30000.  The SDP description below states that the source flow defined
   by the tuple {*,*,233.252.0.1,30000} is identified with FID=0 and the
   source flow defined by the tuple {*,*,233.252.0.2,30000} is
   identified with FID=1.  The SDP description also states that the
   repair flow is to be received at the multicast address of 233.252.0.3
   and at port 30000.

   Figure 6 shows the first and the second source blocks (SB_1 and SB_2)
   generated from these two source flows.  In this example, SB_1 is of
   length 10000 bytes.  Suppose that the FEC scheme uses a symbol length
   of 512 bytes.  Then SB_1 can be divided into 20 symbols after padding
   the source block for 240 bytes.  Assume that the FEC scheme is

   rate-2/3 erasure code, hence, it generates 10 repair symbols from 20
   original symbols for SB_1.  On the other hand, SB_2 is 7000-byte long
   and can be divided into 14 symbols after padding 168 bytes.  Using
   the same encoder, suppose that 7 repair symbols are generated for
   SB_2.

               Figure 6: Source block with two source flows

   The information on the unit of payload length, FEC scheme, symbol
   size, and coding rates can be specified in the FEC Scheme-Specific
   Information (FSSI) field of the SDP element.  If the values of the
   payload lengths from each source flow and the order of appearance of
   source flows in every source block are fixed during the session,
   these values may be also provided in the FSSI field.  To carry FSSI
   information to the FEC receivers, one may use the signaling methods
   described in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-config-signaling].  In our example,
   we will consider the case where the ordering is fixed and known both
   at the sender and the receiver, but the payload lengths will be
   variable from one source block to another.  We assume that the
   payload of a source flow with an FID smaller than another flow's FID
   precedes other payloads in a source block.

   The FEC scheme gets the source blocks as input and generates the
   parity blocks for each source block to protect the whole source
   block.  In the example, the repair payloads for SB_1 consist of 512-
   byte symbols, denoted by @1 to @10.  Similarly @11 to @17 constitute

   the repair payloads for SB_2.  The FEC scheme outputs the repair
   payloads along with the Repair FEC Payload IDs.  In our example,
   Repair FEC Payload ID provides information on the source block
   sequence number and the order the repair symbols are generated.  For
   instance @3 is the third FEC repair symbol for SB_1 and the three
   tuple {@3,SB_1,3} can uniquely deliver this information.  In our
   example, the FEC scheme also provides Explicit Source FEC Payload IDs
   that carry information to indicate which source symbols correspond to
   which source block sequence number and the relative position in the
   source block.  For instance the two tuple {SB_2,2} can be attached to
   $6 as the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID to indicate that $6 is
   protected together with packets belonging to SB_2, and $6 is the
   second payload in SB_2.

   The source packets are generated from the source symbols by
   concatenating consecutive symbols in one packet.  There should not be
   any fragmentation of a source symbol, e.g., symbols #7 and #8 can be
   concatenated in one transport payload of 2000-bytes (The
   implementation should make sure that the size of the resulting source
   packet - payload plus the overhead - is not larger than the path
   MTU), but one portion of symbol #7 should not be put in one source
   packet and the remaining portion in another source packet.  The
   simplest implementation is to place each source symbol in a different
   source packet as shown in Figure 7.

                   Figure 7: Example of a source packet

   The repair packets are generated from the repair symbols belonging to
   the same source block by grouping consecutive symbols in one packet.
   There should not be any fragmentation of a repair symbol, e.g.,
   symbols @4, @5, and @6 can be concatenated in one transport payload
   of 1536-bytes, but @6 should not be divided into smaller sub-symbols
   and spread over multiple repair packets.  The Repair FEC Payload ID
   must carry sufficient information for the decoding process and in our
   example indicating source block sequence number, length of each
   source payload, and the order that the first parity block in a repair
   packet is generated are sufficient.  The exact header format of

   Repair FEC Payload ID may be specified in the FSSI field of the SDP
   element.  In Figure 8 for instance, the repair symbols @4, @5, and @6
   are concatenated together.  The Payload ID {SB_1,4,4,6} states that
   the repair symbols protect SB_1, the first repair symbol in the
   payload is generated as the 4th symbol and the source block consists
   of two source flows carrying 4 and 6 packets from each.

4.  Reconstruction of Source Flows from Repair Flow(s)

4.1.  Example: Multiple Source Flows Protected by a Single Repair Flow

   At the receiver, source flows 1 and 2 are received at
   {233.252.0.1,30000} and {233.252.0.2,30000}, while the repair flow is
   received at {233.252.0.3,30000}.  The CDP can map these tuples to the
   flow IDs using the SDP elements.  Accordingly, the payloads received
   at {233.252.0.1,30000} and {233.252.0.2,30000} are mapped to flow IDs
   0 and 1, respectively.

   The CDP passes the flow IDs and received payloads along with the
   Explicit Source FEC Payload ID to the FEC scheme defined in the SDP
   description.  The CDP also passes the received repair packet payloads
   and Repair FEC Payload ID to the FEC scheme.  The FEC scheme can
   construct the original source block with missing packets by using the
   information given in the FEC Payload IDs.  The FEC Repair Payload ID
   provides the information that SB_1 has packets from two flows with 4
   packets from the first one and 6 packets from the second one.  Flow
   IDs state that the packets from source flow 0 precedes the packets
   from source flow 1.  Explicit Source FEC Payload IDs on the other
   hand provide the information about which source payload appears in
   what order.  Therefore, the FEC scheme can depict an source block
   with exact locations of the missing packets.  Figure 9 depicts the
   case for SB_1.  Since the original source block with missing packets
   can be constructed at the decoder and the FEC scheme knows the coding
   rate (e.g., it might be carried in the FSSI field in the SDP
   description), a proper decoding operation can start as soon as the

   repair symbols are provided to the FEC scheme.

            O: Symbols received from the source flow 1 for SB_1

   When the FEC scheme can recover any missing symbol while more repair
   symbols are arriving, it provides the recovered blocks along with the
   source flow IDs of the recovered blocks as outputs to the CDP.  The
   receiver knows how long to wait to repair the remaining missing
   packets (e.g., specified by the 'repair-window' attribute in the SDP
   description).  After the associated timer expires, the CDP hands over
   whatever could be recovered from the source flow to the application
   layer and continues with processing the next source block.
