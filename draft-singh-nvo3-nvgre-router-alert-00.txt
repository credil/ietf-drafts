                       NVGRE Router Alert Option
                 draft-singh-nvo3-nvgre-router-alert-00

Abstract

   This proposal describes a new option to achieve a mechanism which
   alerts NVGRE egress End Point to more closely examine the contents of
   the packet encapsulated under NVGRE header.  This option is useful
   for case(s) where a given frame encapsulated within a given NVGRE
   segment responsible for carrying data between two different End
   Systems contains some control information (e.g OAM information) that
   may require special handling/processing at NVGRE egress End Point.

Internet-Draft          NVGRE Router Alert Option               May 2013


1.  Introduction

   NVGRE [I-D.draft-sridharan-virtualization-nvgre]is a tunneling
   mechanism to overlay Layer 2 networks on top of Layer 3 networks.
   NVGRE tunnel consists for two NVGRE End Points (Ingress/Egress)
   between virtual and physical networks.  End Point can be any Physical
   Server or netowrk device.  In most common deployments the NVGRE End
   Points are on hypervisor(s).  The primary function of this endpoint
   is to encapsulate/decapsulate Ethernet data frames to and from the
   GRE tunnel, and apply isolation policy scoped on VSID.  In most cases
   the end point of the NVGRE tunnel is intended to be at the edge of
   the network, typically connecting an access switch to an IP transport
   network.  The access switch could be a physical or a virtual switch
   located within the hypervisor on the server which is connected to End
   System which is a VM.

   NVGRE end point encapsulates End System data at the GRE tunnel
   origination node and carries it over L3 network to the GRE tunnel
   terminating node, where NVGRE header is interpreted, removed and data
   is passed on to the End System.

   There could be some scenarios like for case of OAM, where the network
   element at NVGRE originating end point needs to encapsulate some
   control information for a given NVGRE tunnel, and this control
   information needs to be analyzed and processed at the terminating
   NVGRE end point.

   This document defines a mechanism whereby Originating NVGRE end point
   can add additional information to the GRE header, based upon which
   the Terminating NVGRE end point can decide to analyze the payload
   under GRE encapsulated packet, rather then forwarding it to the
   destination End System.

2.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document:

   NVGRE: Network Virtualization using GRE.

   NVGRE End Point: Ingress/egress points between the virtual and the
   physical networks.  Any physical server, physical/virtual access
   switch or network device can be a NVGRE endpoint.

   VSID: Virtual Subnet ID.

   NVGRE Segment: NVGRE tunnel which is responsible for carrying data
   between two different End Systems, e.g.  VMs.  All frames going
   within a NVGRE Segment would have same VSID

   End System: Could be VM etc. - System whose data is expected to go
   over NVGRE Segment.

   OAM: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

   Other terminologies are as defined in
   [I-D.draft-sridharan-virtualization-nvgre].

3.  Approach

   If the Originating NVGRE end point decides to generate control
   information, which needs to go over a given NVGRE segment and if the
   Terminating NVGRE end point needs to analyze and process it, then
   following procedures have to be followed at Originating and
   Terminating NVGRE End Point(s):-

3.1.  Ingress NVGRE End Point Procedure

   When creating the NVGRE header for a given NVGRE segment, the
   Originating NVGRE end point MUST set Router Alert Bit (proposed) as
   one of the bits in Reserved0 filed of NVGRE header.  The VSID for
   this frame MUST be the same as for the given NVGRE segment which
   carries the data traffic of the End System.


       GRE Header:
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |0| |1|0| Reserved0     RA| Ver |   Protocol Type 0x6558        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |               Virtual Subnet ID (VSID)        |   Reserved    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       RA: Router Alter Bit (Proposed)

3.2.  Egress NVGRE End Point Procedure

   On receiving NVGRE frame, the Terminating NVGRE end point would do
   the usual NVGRE processing as defined in
   [I-D.draft-sridharan-virtualization-nvgre], but if the RA Bit
   (proposed) in Reserved0 filed is Set it MUST send the rest of the
   inner frame for further processing to the above application.  The
   details of the applications and how it would process the inner frame
   is outside the scope of this document.  This frame MUST not be sent
   to the target End System.

   Router Alter Bit (RA): IANA is request to assign 1 Bit in the
   Reserved0 field of NVGRE Header to communicate NVGRE Router Alert
   information.
