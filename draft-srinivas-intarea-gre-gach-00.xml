    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 5586 defines a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) mechanism for
      MPLS paths that enables multiplexing of auxiliary traffic over such
      paths along with the user traffic they carry.  Such auxiliary traffic is
      commonly used for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance protocols
      that enable monitoring and management of the path.  This document
      describes the applicability of the G-ACh mechanism to Generic Routing
      Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) <xref target="RFC2784" /> is a
      means of encapsulating one network layer protocol over another.  This
      practice is commonly referred to as "tunneling".  GRE deployments
      typically take the form of one or more logical point-to-point or
      point-to-multipoint tunnels.</t>

      <t>As with other kinds of network links, a problem with logical tunnels
      is how they are monitored and managed.  In some cases no special
      functionality is needed for this purpose beyond that provided by the
      underlying network layer.  In other cases, however, more robust
      Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functionality may be
      required.  For example, a tunnel may be carrying critical traffic that
      is subject to a strict service level agreement, one that requires the
      service provider to monitor the tunnel continuously for connectivity
      faults and performance degradations.</t>

      <t>A mechanism to facilitate such OAM functionality, the Generic
      Associated Channel (G-ACh), has been defined for tunnels based on
      Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) in <xref target="RFC5586" />.  The
      G-ACh provides an auxiliary "side-channel" associated with each tunnel
      that can be used to carry a variety of OAM protocols over the tunnel so
      that it can be monitored and managed.  Examples of OAM protocols defined
      for use over the G-ACh include Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
      <xref target="RFC5880" /> and protocols for precision measurement of
      packet loss, delay, and throughput <xref target="RFC6374" />.</t>

      <t>This document describes how the existing G-ACh mechanism can be used
      for GRE tunnels.  The scope of this document is limited to description
      of the mechanism itself, and does not include discussions on
      applicability of specific G-ACh protocols to GRE tunnels.</t>

    <section title="G-ACh Packet Encapsulation over GRE">
      <section title="Structure of a GRE Encapsulated G-ACh Packet">
        <t>As shown in <xref target="RFC2784" />, a GRE packet has the
        following form, with the outermost encapsulation layer shown at the
        top:</t>

        <t><figure align="center">
          <artwork align="left">
    +-------------------------------+
    |       Delivery Header         |
    +-------------------------------+
    |       GRE Header              |
    +-------------------------------+
    |       Payload Packet          |
    |                               |
    +-------------------------------+</artwork>
        </figure></t>

        <t>The Delivery Header is the header for the underlying network layer
        over which the GRE packet is transported.  It may be an IPv4 header or
        an IPv6 header.  The GRE Header <xref target="RFC2890" /> follows the
        Delivery Header and identifies the format of the payload packet.</t>

        <t>When the payload is a G-ACh message, the GRE packet has the
        following form:</t>

        <t><figure align="center">
          <artwork align="left">
    +------------------------------------+
    |           Delivery Header          |

    |           GRE Header               |

    +------------------------------------+</artwork>
        </figure></t>

        <t>As specified in <xref target="RFC5586" />, the Associated Channel
        Header identifies the format of the G-ACh payload that follows.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="GRE Header">
        <t>The presence of the Associated Channel Header (ACH) is indicated by
        the Protocol Type field in the GRE header (<xref target="RFC2784" />
        and <xref target="RFC2890" />).  The value of the Protocol Type field
        is an EtherType as used for next-layer protocol type identification in
        Ethernet frames.  The EtherType registry is maintained by the
        Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and also
        documented in the IANA "Ethernet Numbers" registry.  The IEEE has
        allocated an EtherType for G-ACh packets as follows:</t>

        <t>The format of the GRE header as documented in <xref
        target="RFC2890" />, when the payload is a G-ACh packet beginning with
        an Associated Channel Header, is:</t>

      <t>IANA is requested to verify that the IANA "Ethernet Numbers" registry
      reflects the IEEE allocation for the G-ACh EtherType.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document indicates how a Generic Associated Channel protocol
      packet can be carried inside a GRE packet.  This encapsulation itself
      poses no security risks beyond those already documented for GRE and the
      G-ACh.  When a G-ACh protocol is used for Operations, Administration,
      and Maintenance of GRE tunnels, the security considerations of that
      protocol also apply.</t>
