    <abstract>
      <t>CPEs are designed to provide IP connectivity to the Home Network.
      Most of the CPEs are also providing the IP addresses of the nodes of the
      Home Network. This makes CPEs good candidates for hosting the Naming
      Service that would make devices reachable from the Home Network but also
      from the Internet.</t>

      <t>CPEs have not been designed to host a Naming Service reachable from
      the Internet. This would expose the CPEs and the Home Network to
      resource exhaustion which would result in making the Home Network
      unreachable, and most probably would also affect the Home Network inner
      communications.</t>

      <t>This document describes an Front End Naming Architecture where the
      CPEs manage the DNS(SEC) zone for its Home Network, and outsource the
      zone to Public Server for resolution coming from the Internet.</t>

      <t>The goal of the document is first to describe a Naming Architecture
      that fulfills Home Network Naming requirements without exposing the CPE
      to resource exhaustion. Then we intend the CPEs to be easily configured
      by the End Users, and describe the necessary information the End User is
      expect to provide to the CPE.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv6 provides global IP reachability to almost all nodes of the Home
      Network even outside the Home Network. However End Users do not want to
      access to the Services hosted in the Home Network with IPv6 addresses,
      but prefer to use names.</t>

      <t>CPEs are already providing IPv6 connectivity to the Home Network and
      generally provide IPv6 addresses or prefixes to the nodes of the Home
      Network. This makes the CPEs a good candidate to manage binding between
      names and IP addresses of the nodes. In other words, the CPE is the
      natural candidate for setting the DNS(SEC) zone file.</t>

      <t>CPEs are usually low powered devices designed for the Home Network,
      but not for heavy traffic. CPEs can host the Naming Service for the Home
      Network but should not be exposed on the Internet. This would expose the
      CPE to resource exhaustion. As a consequence, it may isolate the Home
      Network from the Internet and affects the services hosted by the CPEs,
      thus affecting Home Network communications. As a result, CPE SHOULD NOT
      host the Naming Service of the Home Network for resolutions coming from
      the Internet.</t>

      <t>In this document, we propose that the CPE sets the DNS(SEC) zone of
      the Home Network. The CPE may generate different zones one for the
      queries coming from the Home Network, and one for queries coming from
      the Internet. We respectively call these Zones Homenet View and Public
      View. The CPE hosts the Homenet View and responds to the associated
      DNS(SEC) queries coming from the Home Network. For queries coming from
      the Internet, the CPE outsources the Public View to Public DNS(SEC)
      Servers that responds to the queries.</t>

      <t>This document describes the Front End Naming Architecture where the
      CPE hosts the Naming Service for the Home Network and outsources it for
      queries from outside the Home Network. We especially insists on the
      parameters the CPE requires to properly set up the Front End Naming
      Architecture.</t>

      <t><xref target="sec-arch-requirements"/> describes the Front End Naming
      Architecture requirements. <xref target="sec-arch-presentation"/>

             title="Front End Naming Architecture Requirements">
      <t>This section lists and details goals and requirements of Front End
      Naming Architecture. <list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="- REQUIREMENT 1: ">DNS(SEC) queries for subdomain of
          the Homenet Domain Name MUST be responded by the Public DNS(SEC)
          Servers when issued from outside the Home Network. CPE could hardly
          cope with heavy traffic coming from the Internet. To avoid exposing
          the CPE to resource exhaustion, the Naming Service is outsourced on
          the Public DNS(SEC) Servers for traffic coming from the
          Internet.</t>

          <t hangText="- REQUIREMENT 2: ">The CPE MUST NOT, by default, accept
          any DNS(SEC) queries from outside the Home Network. In some aspects,
          it rewords the previous requirement.</t>

          <t hangText="- REQUIREMENT 3: ">The IP address of the CPE SHOULD NOT
          be publicly published. This requirement avoids the DNS(SEC) queries
          incidentally ends up on the CPE.</t>

          <t hangText="- REQUIREMENT 5: ">DNS(SEC) queries for subdomain of
          the Homenet Domain Name MUST be responded by the CPE when issued
          from the Home Network. To guarantee the Home Network independence in
          case the Home Network has no connectivity on the Internet, the CPE
          MUST respond to DNS(SEC) queries for subdomain of the Homenet Domain
          Name coming from the Home Network.</t>

          <t hangText="- REQUIREMENT 6: ">The CPE MUST be able to update the
          Home Network Zone hosted on the Public DNS(SEC) Servers.</t>

          <t hangText="- REQUIREMENT 7: ">The CPE SHOULD be able to provide
          different views. At least the CPE should be able to handle a view
          for the Home Network nodes and a view for the nodes outside the Home
          Network. Home Network nodes that are not supposed to be reachable
          from outside the Home Network are not expected to be part of the
          latest view.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-arch-presentation"
             title="Front End Naming Architecture Presentation">
      <t>This section describes the Front End Naming Architecture and defines
      the notations used in this document. <list hangIndent="6"

          attached to.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The CPE connects the Home Network to the Internet. Although the
      different functional entities listed below MUST NOT necessarily be
      hosted on the CPE, we assume in this document they are hosted on the
      CPE: <list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="- Homenet Resolving Server: ">is the DNS Resolver
          Server of the Home Network. Typically its IP address is announced
          via DHCPv6. Most of DNS(SEC) queries from nodes on the Home Network
          are expected to be addressed to this Homenet Resolving Server. The
          Homenet Resolving Server is expected to receive queries only from
          the Home Network.</t>

          <t hangText="- Homenet Authoritative Server: ">is the Authoritative
          Server of the Home Network. This server hosts bindings between FQDNs
          and IP addresses. Unless cached, most of the DNS(SEC) queries sent
          from the Home Network that concerns a node in the Home Network are
          expected to be forwarded to this Homenet Authoritative Server. More
          specifically DNS(SEC) resolutions sent from the Home Network are
          expected to be sent to the Homenet Resolving Server. The Homenet
          Resolver Server is a forwarder and forwards to the Homenet
          Authoritative Server queries for domain names or subdomain of the
          Homenet Domain Name. For other resolutions, the Homenet Resolving
          Server proceeds to traditional DNS(SEC) resolutions over the public
          DNS(SEC) infrastructure.</t>

          <t hangText="- Homenet View: ">is the DNS(SEC) zone that contains
          all bindings between FQDNs associated to the Homenet Domain Name and
          IP addresses. The Home Network may have multiple views, but for most
          Home Networks, a single Homenet View is expected. Information of
          this Homenet View is only visible from the Home Network.</t>

          <t hangText="- Public View: ">is the view that contains the bindings
          between FQDNs and IP addresses. Unlike the Homenet View, the Public
          View is expected to be publicly published. The Public View contains
          information visible from the Internet. It is expected that the
          Public View is constituted by a subset of the names of the Homenet
          View. More specifically, devices that are not expected to be
          reachable from the Internet should not be part of the Public View.
          In some implementations, the Public View may be equivalent to the
          the Homenet View. In this latter case Public Views and Homenet Views
          will be represented by a single file.</t>

          <t hangText="- Master Public Server: ">is the part of the CPE that
          deals with the Public view of the Home Network. The Master Public
          Server is in charge of providing the Public View to the Public
          DNS(SEC) Servers. It is not necessarily a DNS(SEC) server. However,
          in this document we are using DNS mechanisms to synchronize the
          Public View in the Public DNS(SEC) Servers and the Public View on
          the CPE.</t>

          <t hangText="- WAN Interface: ">the CPE Interface on the

          <t hangText="- Public DNS(SEC) Servers: ">are the servers on the
          Internet hosting the Public View of the Home Network.</t>

          <t hangText="- Node: ">a Node located on the Internet. This Node is
          expected to be in most of the cases a resolving server.</t>

          the Home Network. There may be one or multiple domain names.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Figure 1 illustrates how a DNS(SEC) resolution is performed from a
      Node in the Home Network or from a node on the Internet.</t>

      <t>The Homenet Node sends a DNS(SEC) query to the Homenet Resolving
      Server (1). When the Homenet Resolving Server receives the DNS(SEC) it
      notices that query name is a subdomain of the Homenet Domain Name
      (example.com), and forwards the query to the Homenet Authoritative
      Server that hosts the Homenet View (2). The Homenet Authoritative Server
      sends the response to the Homenet Resolving Server (3), which finally
      sends the response to the Homenet Node (4).</t>

      <t>For a node located on the Internet, the DNS(SEC) query is requesting
      the Public DNS infrastructure (.com) which redirects the DNS(SEC) query
      to the Public DNS(SEC) Servers (a). The Public DNS(SEC) Server sends the
      response back to the Node (b).</t>

    <section anchor="sec-arch-description"
             title="Front End Naming Architecture Description">
      <t>This section provides a more detailed description of the Front End
      Naming Architecture. More specifically it shows how the entities
      described in <xref target="sec-arch-presentation"/> are organized to
      fulfill the requirements of <xref target="sec-arch-requirements"/>.</t>

      <section title="Setting the Homenet Authoritative Server">
        <t>The Homenet Authoritative MUST be configured to reject any queries
        coming from outside the Home Network, i.e. not from the Homenet
        Interface. In other words, DNS queries related to the Homenet Domain
        Names MUST never be received from the WAN Interface.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Setting the Homenet View">
        <t>The Homenet Authoritative Server may be authoritative for multiple
        Homenet Domain Names and each Homenet Domain Name may be associated
        with multiple views.</t>

        <t>The CPE is expected to be provided the various Homenet Domain Names
        so it can properly generate the associated Homenet Zone files and the
        appropriate DNS(SEC) settings.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Setting the Public View">
        <t>The Public DNS(SEC) Servers MUST handle all DNS(SEC) queries
        related to any Homenet Domain Names that are sent from outside the
        Home Network.</t>

        <t>The CPE MUST generate the Public View. In the case of multiple
        Homenet Domain Names, multiple views MUST be generated, and in order
        to fill properly the SOA and NS field, the CPE must be provided for
        each Homenet Domain Name the corresponding Public DNS(SEC) name, and
        IP addresses.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Synchronizing the Public View">
        <t>Uploading and dynamically updating the zone file on the Public
        Servers can be seen as zone provisioning between the CPE (Hidden
        Master) and the Public Server (Slave Server). This can be handled
        either in band or out of band. DNS dynamic update <xref
        target="RFC2136"/> may be used. However, in this section we detail how
        to take advantage of the DNS slave / master architecture to deploy
        updates to public zones.</t>

        <t>The Public DNS Server is configured as a slave for the Homenet
        Domain Name. This slave configuration has been previously agreed
        between the End User and the provider of the Public DNS Servers. The
        CPE is hosting the Public Zone files associated to the various Homenet
        Domain Names and associated views. Each of these files are associated
        a Public Server. In order to set the master/ slave architecture, the
        CPE acts as a Hidden Master Public Server, which is a regular
        Authoritative DNS(SEC) Server listening on the WAN interface.</t>

        <t>The Hidden Master Public Server is only expected to initiate AXFR
        <xref target="RFC1034"/>, IXFR <xref target="RFC1995"/> transfers to
        configured slave DNS servers. The Hidden Master Public Server should
        send NOTIFY messages <xref target="RFC1996"/> in order to update
        Public DNS server zones as updates occur.</t>

        <t>The CPE MUST be configured to send NOTIFY only when necessary. It
        is recommended for example that it checks first the SOA on the Public
        DNS Server before sending a NOTIFY. In other words, rebooting a CPE
        SHOULD NOT systematically trigger a NOTIFY message.</t>

        <t>Hidden Master Public Server differs from the Homenet Authoritative
        Server by: <list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="- Interface: ">the Homenet Authoritative Server
            listens on the Homenet Interface whereas the Hidden Master Public
            Server listen on the WAN Interface</t>

            <t hangText="- View: ">Homenet Authoritative Server hosts the
            names that are available on the Home Network, whereas the Hidden
            Master Public Server hosts the names that are publicly available.
            These two zones may differ since some of the nodes may not be
            reached from outside the Home Network.</t>

            <t hangText="- Traffic: ">Homenet Authoritative Server expects
            traffic from the Home Network, whereas the Hidden Master Public

          </list></t>

        <t>In this document, Master Public Server differs from the Homenet
        Authoritative Server as different functions. Both functions may be
        implemented by a single running instance of Authoritative Servers.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Securing the Synchronization">
        <t>Exchange between the Public Servers and the CPE MUST be secured, at
        least for integrity protection and for authentication. This is the
        case whatever mechanism is used between the CPE and the Public
        DNS(SEC) Servers.</t>

        <t>TSIG <xref target="RFC2845"/> can be used to secure the DNS
        communications between the CPE and the Public DNS(SEC) Servers. TKEY
        <xref target="RFC2931"/> can be used for re-keying the key used for
        TSIG. Using TSIG and TKEY requires that this mechanism is implemented
        on the DNS(SEC) Server's implementation running on the CPE. One
        disadvantage is that TKEY does not provides authentication mechanism,
        and the initial shared secret must be set manually.</t>

        <t>Protocols like TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/> / DTLS <xref
        target="RFC6347"/> can be used to secure the transactions between the
        Public Servers and the CPE. Their use would require the
        implementations to integrate TLS/DTLS as a security layer. TLS/DTLS
        can use certificates to authenticate the Public Server and the CPE.
        For example, the certificates can be hosted on a dongle.</t>

        <t>IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"/> IKEv2 <xref target="RFC5996"/> can
        also be used to secure the transactions between the CPE and the Public
        Servers. IKEv2 provides multiple authentications possibilities with
        its EAP framework. Then, IPsec security does not require any changes
        of the DNS applications. For these reasons, we recommend using
        IPsec.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Setting the Homenet Resolution Server">
        <t>The Homenet Resolving Server MUST be configured as a DNS forwarder.
        When a DNS(SEC) query coming from the Home Network concerns a Homenet
        Domain Name or a Homenet Subdomain Name, the resolution MUST be
        performed with the Homenet Authoritative Server. If the Home Network
        has multiple Homenet Domain Names, multiple forwarding rules may be
        applied.</t>

        <t>To properly configure a basic configuration, the Homenet Resolving
        Server needs to be informed of the Homenet Domain Names and associated
        Homenet Authoritative Server. They may be one or multiple associated
        Homenet Authoritative Servers. The same Authoritative Naming Server
        may be used for multiple Homenet Domain Names.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Additional Views">

    <section anchor="sec-cpe-interface"
             title="CPE's interface Recommendations">
      <t>This section describes the various objects that are required to
      properly set the Front End Naming Architecture. This section is
      informational, and is intended to clarify the information handled by the
      CPE and the various settings to be done.</t>

      <t>A Public Server is defined with the following information: <list
          hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="- Public Server Name: ">The associated FQDN of the
          Public Server</t>

          <t hangText="- IP addresses: ">The list of IP addresses associated
          to the Public Server. This list should not be provided by the End
          User. Instead, it should be provided by performing a DNSSEC
          exchange. If the Public Server Name DNS resolution cannot be
          performed with DNSSEC, then it is recommended to provide this field.
          This list of IP address is used to generate the Public View with the
          proper values for SOA and NS and associated AAAA fields.</t>

          <t hangText="- Public Server Management Name: ">The FQDN of the
          management interface. This Management interface designated who the
          CPE is synchronizing its Public View with.</t>

          <t hangText="- Public Server Management IP addresses: ">The list of
          IP addresses associated to the Public Server Management Name. This
          field is not expected to be filled by the End User, but to be
          derived from the Public Server Management Name with a DNS(SEC)
          query.</t>

          <t hangText="- Authentication Method: ">How the CPE authenticates
          itself to the Public Server.</t>

          <t hangText="- Authentication data: ">Associated Data.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>To set a View one needs to have the following information: <list
          hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="- Homenet Domain Name: ">The Domain Name of the
          zone.</t>

          <t hangText="- Public Server Name (optional): ">The Server that are
          expected to host the View. It is required both to field the SOA, NS
          and associated AAAA as well as to define where the View has to be
          uploaded. If the View is the Homenet View and the Homenet
          Authoritative Server is hosted on the CPE, then, this information is
          not required.</t>

          <t hangText="- Rules: ">Defines specific rules for deriving the
          View. Example of rule s may be a list of FQDNs or IP addresses that

          <t hangText="- DNSSEC Data:">DNSSEC data required to generate the
          DNSSEC zone. This can be the various DNSSEC Keys for example.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>First the CPE MUST reject DNS queries received from the WAN
      Interface. Then the CPE MUST list the Homenet Views and Public Views.
      Homenet Views are those without the Public Server Name specified and are
      loaded on the Homenet Authoritative Server. The Homenet Resolving Server
      is configured as a forwarder for these Views. Public Views are loaded on
      the Master Public Server, the communications between the Master Public
      Server and the Public Servers are secured, with an IPsec authenticated
      and encrypted traffic flow for example.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-position-homenet"
             title="Position toward Homenet Architecture">
      <t>This section positions the Front End Naming Architecture toward the
      Naming recommendation of <xref target="I-D.chown-homenet-arch"/>.</t>

      <t>The Front End Naming Architecture has been designed to favor
      unmanaged operations. Naming configuration is automatically performed by
      the CPE.</t>

      <t>The Front End Naming Architecture provides the End User a mean to
      assign names to their devices and associate these names to an Internet
      domain. With traditional naming configuration that sets an "search"
      field for the resolvers, the Front End Naming Architecture provides
      relative naming resolution. The search field is configurable on the
      DHCPv6 Server hosted on the CPE.</t>

      <t>Homenet devices can be attached in multiple local and Internet name
      spaces. The Front End Naming Architecture works internally and
      externally depending where the End User is. With Views, not all devices
      are visible from the Internet.</t>

      <t>The Front End Naming Architecture completely coexists with the
      Internet name services.</t>

      <t>With the Homenet View hosted on the CPE, Name resolution and service
      discovery for reachable devices must continue to function if the local
      network is disconnected from the global Internet.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The Front End Naming Architecture described in this document solves
      exposing the CPE's DNS service as a DoS attack vector.</t>

      <section title="Names are less secure than IP addresses">
        <t>This document describes how an End User can make his services and
        devices from his Home Network reachable on the Internet with Names
        rather than IP addresses. This exposes the Home Network to attackers
        since names are expected to provide less randomness than IP addresses.
        The naming delegation protects the End User's privacy by not providing
        the complete zone of the Home Network to the ISP. However, using the
        DNS with names for the Home Network exposes the Home Network and its
        components to dictionary attacks. In fact, with IP addresses, the
        Interface Identifier is 64 bit length leading to 2^64 possibilities
        for a given subnetwork. This is not to mention that the subnet prefix
        is also of 64 bit length, thus providing another 2^64 possibilities.
        On the other hand, names used either for the Home Network domain or
        for the devices present less randomness (livebox, router, printer,
        nicolas, jennifer, ...) and thus exposes the devices to dictionary
        attacks.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Names are less volatile than IP addresses">
        <t>IP addresses may be used to locate a device, a host or a Service.
        However, Home Networks are not expected to be assigned the same Prefix
        over time. As a result observing IP addresses provides some ephemeral
        information about who is accessing the service. On the other hand,
        Names are not expected to be has volatile as IP addresses. As a
        result, logging Names, over time, may be more valuable that logging IP
        addresses, especially to profile End User's characteristics.</t>

        <t>PTR provides a way to bind an IP address to a Name. In that sense
        responding to PTR DNS queries may affect the End User's Privacy. For
        that reason we recommend that End Users may choose to respond or not
        to PTR DNS queries and may return a NXDOMAIN response.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DNSSEC is recommended to authenticate DNS hosted data">
        <t>The document describes how the Secure Delegation can be set between
        the Delegating DNS Server and the Delegated DNS Server.</t>

        <t>Deploying DNSSEC is recommended since in some cases the information
        stored in the DNS is used by the ISP or an IT departments to grant
        access. For example some Servers may performed a PTR DNS query to
        grant access based on host names. With the described Delegating Naming
        Architecture, the ISP or the IT department MUST take into
        consideration that the CPE is outside its area of control. As such,
        with DNS, DNS responses may be forged, resulting in isolating a
        Service, or not enabling a host to access a service. ISPs or IT
        department may not base their access policies on PTR or any DNS
        information. DNSSEC fulfills the DNS lack of trust, and we recommend
        to deploy DNSSEC on CPEs.</t>
