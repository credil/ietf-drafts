Internet-Draft           RDAP Security Services           September 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) core is specified in two
   documents: "Unified Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format"
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query] and "JSON Responses for the Registry
   Data Access Protocol" [I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].  One goal of
   RDAP is to provide security services that do not exist in the WHOIS
   [RFC3912] protocol, including authentication, availability, data
   confidentiality, data integrity, and non-repudiation (note: some of
   these might be a stretch).

   This document describes each of these security services from the
   perspective of RDAP requirements and applicability.  Where
   applicable, informational references to requirements for a WHOIS
   replacement service [RFC3707] are noted.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.1.  Acronyms and Abbreviations

      DNR: Domain Name Registry

      RDAP: Registration Data Access Protocol

      RIR: Regional Internet Registry


3.  Information Security Services and RDAP

   RDAP itself does not include native security services.  Instead, RDAP
   relies on features that are available in other protocol layers to
   provide needed security services including authentication,
   availability, data confidentiality, data integrity, and non-
   repudiation.  A description of each of these security services can be
   found in RFC 4949 [RFC4949].

3.1.  Authentication

   WHOIS does not provide features to identify and authenticate clients.
   As noted in section 3.1.4.2 of RFC 3707 [RFC3707], there is utility
   in allowing server operators to offer "varying degrees of access
   depending on policy and need".  Clients have to be identified and
   authenticated to provide that utility.

Internet-Draft           RDAP Security Services           September 2012


   There are multiple ways to identify and authenticate RDAP clients.
   Candidate technologies include:

   -  HTTP Basic Authentication [RFC2617]: The "basic" scheme can be
      used to send a client's user name and password to a server in
      plaintext, based64-encoded form.  If this scheme is used another
      protocol (such as HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818]) MUST be used to protect
      the client's credentials from disclosure while in transit.

   -  HTTP Digest Authentication [RFC2617]: The "digest" scheme can be
      used to authenticate a client without exposing the client's
      plaintext password.

   -  X.509 Digital Certificates [RFC5280]: The Transport Layer Security
      Protocol [RFC5246] includes an option to identify and authenticate
      clients who possess and present a valid X.509 digital certificate.
      Web clients do not typically possess digital certificates so this
      option is likely impractical.

   -  OAuth [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]: The OAuth authorization framework
      describes a method for clients to access protected web resources
      using access tokens issued by a third party authorization server
      with the permission of the resource owner.  If widely deployed it
      would permit clients to access servers without having to manage
      credentials on a per-server basis.

   -  (What else?)

3.2.  Availability

   An RDAP service has to be available to be useful (need to talk about
   denial of service, anycasting, and anything else that addresses
   availability).

3.3.  Data Confidentiality

   WHOIS does not provide the ability to encrypt data while in transit
   to protect it from inadvertent disclosure.  Web services commonly use
   HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818] to provide that protection.  Examples of data
   confidentiality utility include:

   -  Encryption to protect plaintext passwords exchanged when using the
      HTTP "basic" authentication scheme.

   -  Encryption to protect personal or otherwise sensitive data
      returned in response to RDAP queries.

   -  (What else?)

   If data confidentiality is useful, we should also plan to review the
   JSON Web Encryption draft [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-encryption].

3.4.  Data Integrity

   TBD: is there value in signed responses?  If so, the work being done
   in the JOSE working group (such as what's described in the JSON Web
   Signature draft [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature]) may be useful.
   There's no mention of a "signed response" requirement in RFC 3707.

3.5.  Non-repudiation

   TBD: does it make sense to talk about proof of integrity and data
   origin authentication for responses?  It might in the context of law
   enforcement actions.  Again, there's no requirement mentioned in RFC
   3707.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not specify any IANA actions.


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD
