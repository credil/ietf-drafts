Internet-Draft               New RA Options                  August 2012


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   protocols can be used to configure fixed and mobile nodes with
   various parameters related to addressing and routing [RFC4861],
   [RFC4862], and [RFC4191].  DNS Recursive Server Addresses and Domain
   Name Search Lists are additional parameters that can be configured
   using router advertisements [RFC6106].

   In some unicast IPv4 to IPv6 transition technologies, IPv4 to IPv6
   translation is used such as NAT64 [RFC6145], Mapping of Address and
   Port Translation mode, or MAP-T [I-D.ietf-softwire-map], and to some
   extend in IPv4 Residual Deployment via IPv6 - a Stateless Solution
   (4rd) [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd].  Translation multicast technologies
   are emerging aimed to complement these unicast solutions for
   multicast IPv4 to IPv6 transition.

   In IPv4 to IPv6 translation multicast, specific IPv6 addresses are
   used in which IPv4 addresses are embedded [RFC6180].  Some of these
   addresses are multicast IPv6 addresses and some are unicast.  Both
   multicast and unicast addresses can be generated from the
   corresponding multicast and unicast prefixes.  These prefixes must be
   provisioned on the hosts that are involved in translation.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Multicast Translation Prefixes Configuration

   A host wishing to join a source-specific multicast (SSM) group sends
   an IGMP Membership Report message and includes the group address in
   Multicast Address field of Group Record field in IPv4 [RFC3376].
   Multicast group address MUST be a multicast group address in SSM
   range.  In the IPv4 to IPv6 transition scenarios that are based on
   translation multicast, IGMP Membership Report message must be
   translated into MLD Membership Report message [RFC3810], usually at
   the IGMP/MLD proxy entity [RFC4605].  SSM group is identified with a
   group and source address in (S,G) form.  The source address is
   specified in Source Address field of Group Record field in IGMP
   Membership Report message.  There could be more than one source
   addresses associated with one Multicast Address.

   IGMP to MLD translation entity must be configured with an IPv6

   multicast group prefix that is in SSM range.
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] defines multicast
   prefixes (MPREFIX64) for IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address based
   on an IPv4 multicast address of two types: ASM_MPREFIX64 for any-
   source multicast (ASM) and SSM_MPREFIX64 for source-specific
   multicast (SSM).

   IGMP to MLD translation entity can be configured with SSM_MPREFIX64
   by its default router if the default router includes in its Router
   Advertisements a Multicast SSM Translation Prefix option defined in
   Figure 1.  SSM_MPREFIX64 is of type ff3x:0:8000/96.  Prefix length
   MAY be set to 96. x stands for the scope bits [RFC3306].

   IGMP to MLD translation entity can be configured with ASM_MPREFIX64
   by its default router if the default router includes in its Router
   Advertisements a Multicast ASM Translation Prefix option defined in
   Figure 2.  ASM_MPREFIX64 is of type ffxx:8000::/20.  Prefix length
   MAY be set to 20.  The first x stands for the flags and the second x
   stands for the scope bits [RFC3306].

   SSM groups have one or more sources, S in (S,G).  The source address
   is specified by the joining host in IGMP Membership Report message's
   Source Address field of Group Record.  IPv4 source address in IGMP
   Membership Report message needs to be translated into an IPv6 source
   address in the translated MLD message.

   IGMP to MLD translation entity can be configured with U_PREFIX64 by
   its default router if the default router includes in its Router
   Advertisements a Multicast Translation Unicast Prefix option defined
   in Figure 3.  U_PREFIX64 could be assigned to 64:ff9b::/96 which is
   known as the well-known prefix or to some operator specific value.
   Prefix length MAY be set to 96.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Unicast Addresses
   MUST be formed using the rules defined in [RFC6052].

   U_PREFIX64 MUST also be used in translating IPv4 multicast data
   packets from SSM sources, S of (S,G) into IPv6 multicast data
   packets.  In this case the translation entity is connected to IPv4
   network at the border of an IPv6 network, e.g.  Border Router (BR).
   Border Router MUST also be configured with U_PREFIX64 by its default
   router.  The default router includes in its Router Advertisements a
   Multicast Translation Unicast Prefix option defined in Figure 3.

4.1.  Stateful NAT64

   In NAT64 [RFC6145], IGMP to MLD translation entity is the host.  The
   default router of the host MUST be configured to send SSM_PREFIX64
   and ASM_PREFIX64 in its router advertisements.  In some
   configurations NAT64 box could be the default router then NAT64 box
   MUST be configured to send these RAs.  This includes the case where
   NAT64 is located in Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in broadband
   networks and Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN Gateway) in LTE
   networks.

   The hosts will receive the RAs Multicast ASM Translation Prefix
   option and Multicast SSM Translation Prefix option and use the prefix
   (SSM_PREFIX64 or ASM_PREFIX64) in translating IGMP messages to MLD
   messages and vice versa.

   In NAT64, Border Router which receives IPv4 multicast data is NAT64
   box.  The default router of NAT64 box MUST be configured to send
   Multicast Translation Unicast Prefix option in its router
   advertisements.  This will configure NAT64 box with U_PREFIX64.
   NAT64 box can use this to translate IPv4 multicast data coming from
   SSM sources to IPv6 multicast data.

   In case SSM is supported, the default router for the hosts MUST be
   configured to send Multicast Translation Unicast Prefix option in its
   router advertisements.  The hosts can use U_PREFIX64 in translating
   IGMPv3 messages to MLDv2 messages and in translating IPv6 multicast
   data to IPv4 multicast data.

4.2.  Mapping of Address and Port and 4rd

   In MAP/4rd [I-D.ietf-softwire-map], [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd], IGMP to
   MLD translation entity is the Customer Edge (CE).  The default router
   of CE MUST be configured to send SSM_PREFIX64 and ASM_PREFIX64 in its
   router advertisements.

   The CEs will receive the RAs with Multicast ASM Translation Prefix
   option and Multicast SSM Translation Prefix option and use the prefix
   (SSM_PREFIX64 or ASM_PREFIX64) in translating IGMP messages to MLD
   messages and vice versa.

   In MAP/4rd, the router which receives IPv4 multicast data is the
   Border Router (BR) box.  The default router of BR box MUST be
   configured to send Multicast Translation Unicast Prefix option in its
   router advertisements.  This will configure BR with U_PREFIX64.  BR
   can use this to translate IPv4 multicast data coming from SSM sources
   to IPv6 multicast data.

   In case SSM is supported, the default router for the CE MUST be
   configured to send Multicast Translation Unicast Prefix option in its
   router advertisements.  The CE can use U_PREFIX64 in translating
   IGMPv3 messages to MLDv2 messages and in translating IPv6 multicast
   data to IPv4 multicast data.

4.3.  Other Cases

   TBD.


5.  Multicast Translation Prefix Options

   In this section we define three prefix options that are related to
   the translation of IGMP messages into MLD or vice versa.

   Figure 1 defines Source Specific Multicast translation prefix option
   commonly known as SSM_PREFIX64.  It is an IPv6 prefix belonging to
   source specific multicast (ssm) range with a value similar to ff3x:0:
   8000/33.  It is used in embedding IPv4 SSM range multicast addresses.
   The values MUST conform to
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].

   Figure 2 defines Any Source Multicast translation prefix option
   commonly known as ASM_PREFIX64.  It is an IPv6 prefix belonging to
   any source multicast (asm) range with a value similar to ffxx:
   8000/17.  It is used in embedding IPv4 ASM range multicast addresses.
   The values MUST conform to
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format]

   Figure 3 defines Multicast Translation Unicast prefix option commonly
   known as U_PREFIX64.  It is an IPv6 unicast prefix It is used in
   translating IPv4 source addresses into IPv6 source address or vice
   versa for source specific multicast sources.  [RFC6052] defines two
   types for U_PREFIX_64, well known prefix of 64:ff9b::/96 or the
   network specific prefix and the mapping rules from IPv4 to IPv6
   address and vice versa.

6.  Security Considerations

   Neighbor Discovery is subject to attacks that cause IP packets to
   flow to unexpected places.  Because of this, neighbor discovery
   messages MUST be secured, possibly using Secure Neighbor Discovery
   (SEND) protocol [RFC3971].


7.  IANA Considerations
