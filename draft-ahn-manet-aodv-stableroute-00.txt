Internet-Draft       Stable Route Selection in AODV        December 2011


Abstract

   This document describes an enhancement on AODV that can allow a
   route with more stable intermediate nodes to be selected. For this,
   a new field, called the 'RouteStability' field, is introduced in the
   RREQ message and in the AODV routing table entry.

Internet-Draft       Stable Route Selection in AODV        December 2011


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   In a MANET, nodes can have mobility, resulting in route instability.
   In AODV [1], a route is discovered by flooding RREQs and the route
   with the minimum hop count is chosen without considering link
   stability. Therefore, if any nodes in a chosen route move, the route
   has high possibility of link breaks which incur route
   reestablishment. This route reestablishment causes service disruption
   as well as high control message overhead.
 
   In this draft, we define a new field, called the RouteStability
   field, in the RREQ message of AODV so that the stability of the route
   discovered by the RREQ message can be informed to the destination.
   Also, to allow RREQ messages which have discovered more stable
   routes than the previous RREQ messages with the same destination
   sequence number to be forwarded, a new field, called the
   RouteStability field, is added to the entry of the routing table.
   How to determine the stability of a route is out of the scope of this
   draft.

  
3.  Terminology

   RouteStability       The metric to indicate the stability of a route
                        (a larger 'RouteStability' value means more
                        stable)     

4.  Use of the RouteStability Field

   In this mechanism, we assume that each MANET node can compute the
   stability of itself. How to calculate this stability information is
   out of the scope of this draft.

   In order to allow more stable routes to be selected, we define a new
   field both in the RREQ message and in the routing table entry, called
   the 'RouteStability' field, which indicates the stability of the
   route.

Internet-Draft       Stable Route Selection in AODV        December 2011

   When a node receives an RREQ message, it compares the value in the
   'RouteStability' field of the RREQ message and that of the
   corresponding routing table entry. If the value in the RREQ message
   is larger than that of the routing table entry, the node updates the
   'RouteStability' field of the routing table entry to that of the RREQ
   message and updates the value of the 'RouteStability' field of the
   RREQ message and forwards the RREQ message. Otherwise, it discards
   the RREQ message.

   If a MANET node receives the first RREQ message destined to itself,
   it waits for more RREP messages during a given time interval, instead
   of sending back an RREP message for the first RREQ message. After the
   given time interval, the destination node sends an RREP message in
   response to the RREQ message with the largest 'RouteStability' value.


5.  Message Format

   TBD.


6.  Other Considerations

   TBD.
