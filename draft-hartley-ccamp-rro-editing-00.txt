     Abstract 

      
        This document provides extensions for the Resource ReserVation 
        Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to allow the communication of 
        changes made by a node to the information provided by other nodes in 
        a ROUTE_RECORD Object (RRO) in Path and Resv messages, or to 
        indicate that it has itself provided incomplete information.

     1. Introduction 

        The signaling process of a Label-Switched Path (LSP) may require 
        gathering information of the actual path traversed by the LSP. The 
        procedure for collecting this information includes the hop-by-hop 
        construction of a Record Route Object (RRO) in the Path and Resv 
        messages, containing information on the path traversed by the LSP 
        ([RFC-3209], [RFC-3473], [RFC-4873], [RFC-5420], [RFC-5553], [DRAFT-
        SRLG], [DRAFT-METRIC]). There are several use cases, described in 
        this document, in which one or more nodes on the path of an LSP may 
        require that the RRO in the Path and/or Resv be edited to remove or 
        summarize data contained in the RRO. However, it is important for 
        the ingress or egress nodes to know what RRO subobjects have been 
        edited by intermediate nodes. This document addresses this 
        requirement.

     Internet-Draft    draft-hartley-ccamp-rro-editing-00       October 2013 
         

     1.1. Use Cases 

        Use cases where RRO editing can take place are described in this 
        subsection.  

     1.1.1. Overlay and inter-domain networks  

        In the GMPLS overlay model there is a client-server relationship 
        [RFC4208]. GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) is the reference point 
        where policies can be applied. In this cases policy at the server 
        network boundary may require that some or all information related to 
        the server network be edited, summarized or removed when 
        communicating with the client nodes. Similar policy requirements 
        exist for inter-domain LSPs and in E-NNI use case. 

     1.1.2. RRO reduction 

        If an LSP with many hops is signaled and a great deal of information 
        is collected at each hop, it is possible that the RRO may grow to 
        the point where it reaches its maximum possible size or RSVP packet 
        fragmentation becomes a problem. In this case a node may summarize 
        or remove information from the RRO to reduce its size. 

     2. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

        This section describes the signaling extensions required to address 
        the aforementioned requirements. Specifically, the requirements are 
        addressed by defining a new RRO sub-object that can be used to 
        reference what information in RRO has been edited, as detailed in 
        the following.  

     2.1. IPv4 RRO-edit RRO sub-object 

        A new RRO sub-object is defined in order to indicate that another 
        RRO sub-object within the same hop has been edited. 

         0                   1                   2                   3 

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

        |      Type     |     Length    |  Edited type  |E|P|S|R|reserve| 

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

        |                  Editing node address (4 bytes)               |

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

        The sub-object fields are defined as follows: 

        Type: The sub-object type, to be assigned by IANA (suggested value: 
        TBD). 

        Length: the total length of the TLV, in bytes. It MUST be 8.  

        Edited type: the type of the sub-object within the same hop to which 
        the flags in this sub-object apply. 

        E (Edited) bit: When set, this bit indicates that the specified RRO 
        sub-object has been edited in some way. 

        P (Partial) bit: When set, this bit indicates that the data 
        contained in the specified RRO sub-object is incomplete. 

        S (Summary) bit: When set, this bit indicates that the data 
        contained in the specified RRO sub-object has been summarized. 

        R (Removed) bit. When set, this bit indicates that the specified RRO 
        sub-object has been removed entirely. 

        Reserved: This field SHOULD be set to zero on transmission, and MUST 
        be ignored on receipt. 

        Editing node address: an IPv4 address unique to the node that has 
        edited the RRO and inserted this sub-object. 

     2.2. IPv6 RRO-edit RRO sub-object 

        To be added in future revision.  

     2.3. RRO-edit sub-object Processing Rules 

        The processing rules in this section apply to the processing of both 
        Path and Resv RROs. 

        Normal RRO processing involves a node simply adding data related to 
        the local hop to the RRO received from the prior node to RRO, and 
        placing the new RRO in the message to be transmitted. In this case 
        the transmitted RRO contains all data that was present in the 
        received RRO. 

        If a node edits the data in the received RRO such that the same data 
        is not present in the transmitted RRO, or if it is supplying

        incomplete or summarized data on its own behalf, then the following 
        rules apply at the processing node. 

          . For each sub-object type that has been edited within a hop, a 
             RRO-edited sub-object SHOULD be inserted into the same hop in 
             the RRO. The RRO-edited sub-object MAY be omitted entirely if 
             the processing node's policy prevents communication of this 
             information. 
          . Multiple RRO-edited sub-objects describing edits to the same 
             type of sub-object (i.e. with the same "Edited type" field) 
             SHOULD NOT be added in the same hop.  
          . Multiple RRO-edited sub-objects describing edits to the same 
             type of sub-object (i.e. with the same "Edited type" field) MAY 
             be added to different hops if appropriate.  
          . The node SHOULD add its own local address to the "editing node 
             address" field of the RRO-edited sub-object. This field MAY be 
             set to zero if the processing node's policy prevents self-
             identification. 
          . The node SHOULD set the appropriate bits in the flags field to 
             indicate the changes that have been made to the subsequent RRO 
             sub-object. 
          . A node SHOULD NOT insert a RRO-edited sub-object with all flags 
             set to zero. 
          . Unassigned flag bits are considered reserved. They SHOULD be 
             set to zero. 

        The following rules apply at a node processing a received RRO-edited 
        sub-object: 

          . Any set flag whose meaning is either unassigned or not 
             understood SHOULD be ignored. 
          . If an RRO is received with multiple RRO-edited sub-objects 
             describing edits to the same type of sub-object within the same 
             hop, the second and subsequent RRO-edited sub-objects SHOULD be 
             ignored. 

     3. Security Considerations 

        To be added in a future version.  

     4. IANA Considerations 

     4.1. ROUTE_RECORD Object 

        IANA has made the following assignments in the "Class Names, Class 
        Numbers, and Class Types" section of the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry 
        located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters.  It is
