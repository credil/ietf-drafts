      DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY Algorithm IANA Registry Updates
                 draft-srose-dnssec-registry-update-00

Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of
   cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over
   DNS data.  The algorithms specified for use with DNSSEC are reflected
   in an IANA maintained registry.  This document presents a set of
   changes for some entries of the registry and presents a new registry
   table.

Internet-Draft            IANA Registry Update             November 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702] uses
   digital signatures over DNS data to provide source authentication and
   integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry to list codes for
   digital signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm
   and one-way hash function).

   This document replaces the current IANA registry for Domain Name
   System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers with a newly defined
   registry table.  This new table (Section 2.2 below) contains a
   collection of changes to selected entries originally set aside for
   future algorithm specification that did not occur.  These entries are
   changed to "Reserved" to avoid potential conflicts with older
   implementations.  This document also brings the list of references
   for entries up to date.

2.  The DNS Security Algorithm Number Sub-registry

   The DNS Security Algorithm Number sub-registry (part of the Domain
   Name System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be replaced with the
   table below.  There are additional differences to entries that are
   described in sub-section 2.1 and the overall new registry table is in
   sub-section 2.2.

2.1.  Updates and Additions

   This document updates three entries in the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Registry.  They are:

   The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved".

   The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved".

   The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved".

   The above values are changed to "Reserved" because they were
   placeholders for algorithms that were not fully specified for use
   with DNSSEC.  Older implementations may still have these algorithm
   codes assigned, so these codes are reserved to prevent potential
   incompatibilities.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document replaces the Domain Name System (DNS) Security
   Algorithm Numbers registry with new registry table is in Section 2.2.
   The changes include moving three registry entries to "Reserved" and
   updating the reference list for entries.

   The original Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number
   registry is available at

4.  Security Considerations

   This document replaces the Domain Name System (DNS) Security
   Algorithm Numbers registry with an updated table.  It is not meant to
   be a discussion on algorithm superiority.  No new security
   considerations are raised in this document.
