               draft-andrews-dnsop-update-parent-zones-00

Abstract

   DNS UPDATE was developed to allow DNS zones to be updated.

   There is a perception that UPDATE can not be used in conjuction with
   the Registry, Registar, Registrant (RRR) model to update a zone.

   This document explains how UPDATE can be used in the RRR model.

Internet-Draft            Updating Parent Zones           September 2013


1.  Introduction

   UPDATE [RFC2136]is designed to update any zone in the DNS.  This
   includes updating delegating NS records, glue address records and DS
   record.

   While UPDATE is primarly designed to UPDATE a zone directly there in
   no reason why UPDATE requests cannot be translated to the EPP
   requests to perform the changes.

   This would provide a uniform model to update parent zone regardless
   of where they are in the DNS heirachy.


2.  Translation

   The Registrar would host a server that authenticates UPDATE requests
   received directly or relayed by the Registry using TSIG [RFC2845],
   then translate the actions in the UPDATE request into EPP transaction
   requests.  The results of those EPP transactions would be relayed to
   the UPDATE client.

   Requests that are not TSIG signed are rejected.

   The translating server would handle a restricted subset of UPDATE
   requests, possibly ignoring the prerequiste section.  UPDATE requests
   would be limited to those supported by EPP.

   e.g.  Add NS record.  Delete all NS records.  Add A record.  Delete
   AAAA record.  Add DS record.  Delete DS record.

   The translating server may also override/ignore the TTL in the UPDATE
   request.


3.  Authentication

   Authentication would be done using TSIG.  TSIG was designed to be
   uses in a environment where requests are relayed.

   Authentication can be done down to the <NAME,TYPE> tuple.  There
   exist nameservers that already implement access contols down to this
   level of granuality based on the presented TSIG.

   This would allow nameservers to update their own address records as
   they get renumbered without being able to update anything else.

   This would DNSSEC key management software to update DS records

   without being able to update anything else.

   As Registrars do all the authentication and generate the signed
   responses there is no need for the Registry to have access to the
   private material using in TSIG.  Registrars already handle shared
   keys in these numbers with their web interfaces.


4.  Direct to Registrar

   The hardest part of Direct to Registrar is finding where to send the
   UPDATE request.  This would most probably just be advised to the
   Registrant.


5.  Indirect to Registrar

   In the indirect model the Registry would host a UPDATE relay server
   which would examine the first record of the UPDATE section and relay
   the request to the Registrar of record for the owner name of that
   record.  The response would be relayed back.

   The relay can use either TCP or UDP when forwarding UPDATE requests
   as TSIG supports changes to the DNS id field when a request/response
   is relayed.

   This is consistent with how tools like nsupdate work out where to
   send a UPDATE request.  They look at the ownername of the first
   record and use it to discover the containing zone.


6.  Security Considerations

   The UPDATE requests are all TSIG signed.  This is a proven method for
   securing UPDATE requests in the DNS.
