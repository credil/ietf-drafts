This document presents a protocol with which to implement Realm
Specific IP (RSIP).  The protocol defined herein allows negotiation
of resources between an RSIP host and gateway, so that the host can
lease some of the gateway's addressing parameters in order to
establish a global network presence.  This protocol is designed to
operate on the application layer and to use its own TCP or UDP port.
In particular, the protocol allows a gateway to allocate addressing
and control parameters to a host such that a flow policy can be
enforced at the gateway.

This document is a product of the Network Address Translator Working
Group of the IETF.
