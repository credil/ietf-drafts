                   A Larger Loopback Prefix for IPv6
            draft-smith-v6ops-larger-ipv6-loopback-prefix-01

Abstract

   During the development of a network application, it can be useful to
   run multiple instances of the application using the same transport
   layer protocol port on the same development host, while also having
   network access to the application instances limited to the local
   host.  Under IPv4, this has been possible by using different loopback
   addresses within 127/8.  It is not possible under IPv6, as the
   loopback prefix of ::1/128 only provides a single loopback address.
   This memo proposes a new larger loopback prefix that will provide
   many loopback IPv6 addresses.

Internet-Draft        A Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix          August 2012


1.  Introduction

   During the development of a network application, it can be useful to
   run multiple instances of the application on the same development
   host.  It may also be useful or important for network access to these
   application instances to be limited to the development host itself.

   Networked applications that use fixed transport layer protocol ports
   will typically accept incoming traffic on that port for any address
   assigned to the host.  This will prevent multiple instances of the
   application running on the same port.  This port reuse limitation can
   be overcome by having each application instance bind to different
   individual addresses available on the host.

   Under IPv4, the 127/8 loopback prefix [RFC1122] provides many
   addresses that can be used to run multiple instances of an
   application on the same port, while also limiting access to the local
   host.

   Under IPv6, the ::1/128 loopback prefix [RFC4291] only provides a
   single address.  Multiple application instances using the the same
   port, bound to different loopback addresses, is not possible.

   The IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address form of 127/8, ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104
   [RFC4291], could be used to provide more host local loopback
   addresses.  However these addresses do not have native IPv6 address
   properties.  For example, they cannot accomodate 64 bit Interface
   Identifiers.

   A Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Address (ULA) prefix [RFC4193] could be
   used to increase the number of addresses available on the local host.
   However this prefix would need to be manually generated and
   configured at least once by a system administrator.  Without
   additonal configuration, traffic towards most addresses within the
   prefix would not be prevented from leaving the local host, and access
   may not be limited to the local host.  A ULA prefix would not be well
   known, and would not be convenient to remember and type without
   violating the randomness requirements of the Global ID component of a
   ULA prefix.

   This memo proposes a new larger IPv6 loopback prefix that provides
   more loopback addresses and has properties of native IPv6 addresses.
   This prefix will also suit other uses of multiple loopback addresses
   that may emerge.

   This memo, if published, updates [RFC4291] and [RFC5156].

Internet-Draft        A Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix          August 2012


1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Larger Loopback Prefix Requirements

   A new larger loopback prefix should attempt to satisfy all of the
   following requirements:

   o  be a well known prefix,

   o  be within an existing special purpose prefix,

   o  be easy for a human to remember,

   o  be easy for a human to type,

   o  covers the existing loopback prefix,

   o  supports 64 bit Interface Identifiers,

   o  provides a large number of /64 subnets.


3.  Proposed Larger Loopback Prefix

   The proposed larger loopback prefix is:

   0001:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/48

   or concisely,

   1::/48

   This prefix meets all but one of the requirements, as it does not
   cover the existing ::1/128 loopback prefix.  It is not possible for a
   larger loopback prefix with a length of /64 or shorter to cover
   ::1/128, as this would also cover both the IPv4 Mapped IPv6 Address
   prefix, ::ffff:0.0.0.0/96, and the deprecated IPv4-Compatible IPv6
   Address prefix, ::0.0.0.0/96 [RFC4291].

   Some IP implementations represent or perform the loopback function
   using a "loopback" virtual link layer interface. 127.0.0.1/8 is
   usually configured on this interface at system initialisation, even
   though all addresses within 127/8 are valid loopback addresses.

   Similarly, ::1/128 is also usually configured on the loopback
   interface at system initialisation.

   For the new larger loopback prefix, the address automatically
   configured on a loopback interface should be:

   1::1/64


4.  Larger Loopback Prefix Processing Rules

4.1.  Host Rules

4.1.1.  Packets Sent with Larger Loopback Source and/or Destination
        Addresses

   Packets with larger loopback source and/or destination addresses MUST
   be returned to the originating host for standard processing by the
   local IPv6 protocol implementation.  They MUST NOT be sent over any
   external links attached to the host.

   All destinations within the larger loopback prefix MUST be considered
   assigned to the local host.

4.1.2.  Packets Received Externally With Larger Loopback Source and/or
        Destination Addresses

   Packets with larger loopback source and/or destination addresses
   received over any of the external links attached to the host MUST be
   dropped.  ICMPv6 error messages, such as Destination Unreachable
   messages, MUST NOT be generated for these dropped packets.

   For these dropped packets, it may be useful to generate an
   appropriate system log message, indicating a packet with an invalid
   source or destination address (a "martian") was received over an
   external interface.  By default, these messages should be suppressed.
   If they are enabled, they should be appropriately rate limited to
   prevent a system log denial-of-service attack.

4.2.  Router Rules

   IPv4 loopback packet processing rules for routers, specified in
   [RFC1812], by default prohibited forwarding of packets with 127/8
   destinations, other than those originated locally and returned back
   to the router itself.  A software switch could be provided to disable
   this prohibition.  This special case of allowing forwarding of
   packets towards 127/8 destinations has been taken advantage of by
   [RFC4379].  An equivalent function for IPv6 is provided by using the

Internet-Draft        A Larger IPv6 Loopback Prefix          August 2012


   IPv4-Mapped IPv6 prefix of ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104.

   The existing ::1/128 packet processing rules for routers is the same
   as for IPv6 hosts [RFC4291].

   For the new larger loopback prefix, the IPv6 router processing rules
   are modified to match those of IPv4.

4.2.1.  Packets Sent with Larger Loopback Source and/or Destination
        Addresses

   By default, a router MUST follow the host processing rules, described
   previously, for packets sent with larger loopback source and/or
   destination addresses.

   A software switch may be provided to permit packets with larger
   loopback source and/or destination addresses to be sent via an
   external interface.  If provided, this software switch MUST default
   to off.

4.2.2.  Packets Received Externally With Larger Loopback Source and/or
        Destination Addresses

   By default, a router MUST follow the host processing rules, described
   previously, for packets received externally with larger loopback
   source and/or destination addresses.

   A software switch may be provided to permit received packets with
   larger loopback source and/or destination addresses to be forwarded
   via an external interface.  This software switch MUST default to off.


5.  Acknowledgements

   Nick Hilliard provided valuable review and comments on this memo.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate 1::/48 from within 0::/8 of the
   Internet Protocol Version 6 Address Space, for use as a larger
   loopback prefix for IPv6, as described in this memo.


7.  Security Considerations

   During deployment of a new larger loopback prefix, there will be a
   transition period where some hosts and routers have implemented the

   larger loopback processing rules defined in this memo while others
   haven't.  These legacy hosts and routers will forward larger loopback
   traffic using conventional unicast processing.  For traffic towards
   non-local larger loopback addresses, traffic will most likely leave
   the legacy originating host via it's default route, and may be
   forwarded by legacy routers using their default route.  This may
   disclose sensitive information, violating security policy.

   Packet filters, matching traffic with larger loopback source and/or
   destination addresses, should be used to prevent unintended
   forwarding of loopback traffic.  They should be deployed at the
   following locations:

   o  on the legacy hosts themselves,

   o  on legacy routers interconnecting two different networks,

   o  on appropriate security domain boundary legacy routers within the
      local network, if not all legacy routers within the local network.

   Routes for the new larger loopback prefix should not be announced or
   accepted if received under any circumstances.
