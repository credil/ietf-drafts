1.  Introduction

   The [VIPR-FRAMEWORK] specification assumes that a VIPR domain has a
   direct connection with the PSTN.  An example of the interactions
   between VIPR domains following this specification are depicted in the
   following diagram:

   (For all the diagrams in this document, "--->" means a [RELOAD]
   transaction, "~~~~>" a PSTN transaction, ":::>" a [PVP] transaction
   and "===>" a [SIP] transaction).

   Even if a VIPR domain has a direct access to the PSTN, it is
   generally not economical to have one PSTN connection for each VIPR
   server, so the PSTN gateway is generally on a different physical box,
   so it can be shared inside the domain.  The communication protocol
   with the PSTN gateway is generally SIP, probably using the SIPconnect
   profile defined by the SIP Forum [1].  An example of the interactions
   are depicted in the following diagram:

   One important thing to consider here is that the SIP profile used
   between the call agent and the PSTN gateway inside the VIPR domain is
   completely different from the SIP profile used between the VIPR
   domains A and B subsequently to the PVP validation.  The second SIP
   profile will use wideband audio, video, realtime text and other
   features that are not possible when going through the PSTN.  For the
   remaining of the discussion, we will call this SIP profile SIPbeyond,
   in reference to the book "SIP Beyond VoIP" by Henry Sinnreich, Alan
   B. Johnston and Robert J. Sparks.

   The VIPR specifications does not prevent to move the PSTN gateway
   outside the VIPR domain, for example by using SIP trunking.  In this
   case the SIP connection to the provider still use the SIPconnect
   profile, and the direct route used subsequently to the validation
   still use the SIPbeyond profile.  Because of this, VIPR still work
   the same way as before, as depicted in the following diagram:

   Obviously what is true for outgoing calls is also true for incoming
   call and a VIPR domain can also receive incoming PSTN calls from an
   internal PSTN gateway or, as depicted in the following diagram, from
   an external PSTN gateway located in a provider:

   In this configuration, it is important to consider that the two
   providers can have some peering arrangement between them that will
   shortcut the PSTN, without either of the two VIPR domains knowing it.
   The probability of a short-cut is even higher if the two providers
   are in fact the same provider.  Even a VIPR domain that is using only
   a direct connection to the PSTN cannot assume that a call is really
   going through the PSTN, as the PSTN provider itself can choose to use
   VoIP to route the calls behind the PSTN gateways.  The following
   diagram depicts what happen when the two providers use peering:

     DomainA        ProviderX     RELOAD       ProviderY      DomainB

   So at this point, we have to admit the reality that there is no
   guarantee that a call made to a PSTN gateway or to a provider will
   necessarily been routed over the PSTN, and that we will have to
   assume that in any cases the call will have the same properties than
   if it was fully routed over the PSTN.  Without this assumption, the
   premises of VIPR no longer hold.

   Going further, there is also nothing that prevent the providers to
   use VIPR as a replacement for their peering arrangement.  The main
   problem with this is that these providers will not be able to do much
   more than toll bypass, as the SIP profile used to connect to and from
   their servers, SIPconnect, does not support any of the features that
   VIPR is supposed to enable.  But because no recommendations will ever
   prevent these providers to do this, this document should try its best
   to accommodate a VIPR federation that include them by:

   1.  guaranteeing that providers using VIPR for toll bypassing will
       not impede the VIPR federation,
   2.  providing a way for providers to fully participate in the VIPR
       federation by enabling them to establish SIP connections
       supporting the enhanced features promised by VIPR.

1.1.  Problems Created by Providers using VIPR as Toll Bypass

   The problem with providers using VIPR for the sole purpose of toll
   bypass is that it creates the possibility that more than one VIPR
   domain claim ownership of a specific phone number.  The assumption in
   the VIPR specification is that, although multiple VIPR domains can
   claim the ownership of a number, only one of them is the rightful
   owner of this number.  Now that we demonstrated that there was
   nothing preventing one or more levels of VIPR domains between the
   user of the phone number and the PSTN, this assumption no longer
   holds.  The consequences of this reality is that there will be one
   Originating VCR generated for each VIPR domain in the outgoing call
   path, and there will be one Terminating VCR generated for each VIPR
   domain in the incoming call path.

1.1.1.  Multiple VIPR Domains in the Outgoing Call Path

   The problem with multiple VIPR domains in the outgoing call path is
   that multiple originating VCR will be generated, each one triggering
   a PVP transaction, as depicted in the following diagram:

   The assumption that only one PVP transaction will succeed is not true
   in this case, as both DomainA and ProviderX have the information to
   validate PVP transaction.  Depending on the implementation of VIPR on
   the DomainB domain, either the first of the two PVP transaction will
   succeed, or both will succeed.  If only the DomainA PVP transaction
   succeeds then enhanced SIP will use the direct route from DomainA to
   DomainB, with a fallback to the PSTN if this route fails.  If only
   the ProviderX PVP transaction succeeds, then toll bypass will be
   used, but the next call will trigger a new originating VCR that after
   a successful PVP transaction will create a direct enhanced SIP route
   between DomainA and DomainB. if both succeeds, then the enhanced SIP
   will use the direct route from DomainA to DomainB, with a fallback to
   toll bypass if this route fails.

1.1.2.  Multiple VIPR Domains in the Incoming Call Path

   The problem with multiple VIPR domains in the incoming call path is
   that multiple terminating VCR will be generated, each one matching a
   VIPR-REGISTRATION in the RELOAD overlay.  Each PVP transaction
   created for each VIPR-REGISTRATION has a chance to succeed, as
   depicted in the following diagram:

   Here also more than one PVP transaction will succeed, but this time
   the originating VIPR domain will receive multiple SIP enhanced
   routes, without any guidance on which one to use for subsequent
   calls.

1.2.  Problems Created by Providers not Using Enhanced SIP

   In all the diagrams above, the connection to the provider of the PSTN
   gateway use a SIP profile that does not support enhanced SIP
   features, like video, wideband audio, realtime text, etc...  Because
   of this limitation, even if a provider wants to do the right thing,
   it cannot provide to its customers a SIP route supporting this
   features.  To be able to participate fully into a VIPR federation, a

   provider will need to know the enhanced features supported by the
   endpoint in order to provide SIP routes that can use these features.
