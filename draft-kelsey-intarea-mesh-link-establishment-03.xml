      <t>
        This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE)
         protocol for establishing and configuring secure links in an ad hoc
         mesh radio network.
        Effective mesh networking using radio links requires identifying,
         configuring, and securing usable links to neighboring devices.
        In an ad hoc mesh network a device's neighbors may come and go
         as the network's membership and physical environment change.
        Newly usable links need to be identified and configured
         automatically, where configuration values can include
         link-layer addresses, transmit and receive modes,
         security parameters, and so forth.
        MLE includes the option of securing the configuration
         messages themselves, as link-layer security is typically not
         available prior to configuration.

      </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The configuration of individual links in an ad hoc mesh network
         can fall into a gap between standards.
        Link layer standards typically deal with individual links and networking
         standards assume that the links are up and running.
        In an ad hoc mesh network a device's neighbors may come and go
         as the network's membership and physical environment change,
         requiring that new links be configured automatically.
        The required configuration information can include link layer
         addressing, transmit and receive modes, wake/sleep cycles,
         and so on.
       </t><t>
        Security configuration is particularly important, as the
         link layer may not be able to secure packets until after
         the link itself has been configured.
        Existing IETF neighbor discovery protocols, such as
         IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861"/> and
         NHDP <xref target="RFC6130"/>
         either require (IPv6 ND) or
         recommend (NHDP) that their messages be sent over secured
         links.
        While there are some similarities between these protocols and
         MLE, they are actually complementary: MLE is entirely
         concerned with link-layer configuration, including security,
         while IPv6 ND and NHDP use already-configured links to
         discover IP properties of their neighbors.
       </t><t>
        MLE can be used to configure individual links and to distribute
         configuration values that are shared across a network.
        Per-link configuration uses one-hop messages with
         link-local addresses.
        Network-wide configuration uses multicasts and requires some
         form of multi-hop multicast forwarding.
      </t><t>        
        One of the most important properties of a radio link, how
         reliably the two neighbors can communicate, often cannot be
         determined unilaterally by either node.
        Many radio links are asymmetric, where messages traveling
         one way across the link are received more or less
         reliably than messages traveling in the opposite direction.
        There is a chicken and egg problem here.
        It is a waste of effort to configure a link that does
         not have sufficient two-way reliability to be useful,
         but the two-way reliability cannot be determined without
         exchanging messages over the link.
        MLE resolves this by allowing a node to
         periodically multicast an estimate of the quality of its links.
        This allows a node to determine if it has a usable
         radio link to a neighbor without first configuring
         that link.

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>
        MLE provides a means of transmitting link configuration values.
        An MLE message is one of:
    	  <list style="hanging" hangIndent="20">
	    <t hangText="Link configuration">
              A one-hop unicast sent as part of establishing a link with one
              particular neighbor.
              Link configuration messages are either a request that the link
               be configured, or an acceptance or rejection of such a request.
            </t>
	    <t hangText="Advertisement"> A one-hop multicast that
              advertise a node's link quality estimates to its neighbors.</t>
	    <t hangText="Update">
              A multicast that updates a shared configuration value.</t>
          </list>
        If additional negotiation is required, establishment of a link
         may require an exchange of two or more unicast messages.
        The only multiple-message exchange in MLE protocol
         as described in this document
         performs liveness determination (replay counter
         initialization).
          </t>
       <t>
        MLE messages are sent using UDP.
      </t>
      <t>
        A node maintains two boolean values for each neighbor:
    	  <list style="hanging" hangIndent="10">
	    <t hangText="Receive State">
              True if the node will accept incoming non-MLE messages from
               that neighbor.</t>
	    <t hangText="Transmit State">
              A local cache of the neighbor's Receive State corresponding to
              this node.</t>
          </list>
        Both values default to false.
        The Receive State is set to true when the node accepts an
         incoming link request from the neighbor, and set to false
         when the link configuration information is discarded for
         any reason (link failure or timeout, for example).
        The Transmit State is set to true when a link accept message
         is received from the neighbor.
        When an advertisement message is received from the neighbor the
         Transmit State is set to the neighbor's Receive State as
         reported, either implicitly or explicitly, in that message.
      </t>
      <t>
          These states are advisory only; a node may send a message to
           a neighbor
           regardless of the Transmit State of that neighbor.
          Similarly, a node may unilaterally change its Receive State
           (and discard any link configuration data)
           without first informing the neighbor of its intention.
          The change in Receive State will be reflected in the next
           advertisement sent by the node.
      </t>
   </section>

    <section title="Security Formats">
      <t>
        One of the main functions of MLE is to initialize link-layer
         security.
        This means that MLE itself cannot rely on link-layer security.
        To avoid the cost and complexity of adding a second security
         suite, MLE reuses that of the link layer.
        This document describes two security suites, one with no
         security and the other using 
            Advanced Encryption Standard 128
       <xref target="AES"></xref> in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode
       <xref target="CCM"></xref> as described in <xref target="IEEE802154"/>.
        Later extensions may include other security suites for use
         with other types of links.
      </t><t>
        An MLE message begins with single byte indicating the
        security suite used in that message.
        If that initial byte is "255" no security is used and the
         messages has no additional security data.
        An initial byte of "0" indicates that the message is secured as
         described in <xref target="IEEE802154"/>
        (all codes are to be confirmed by IANA; see
        <xref target="sec:IANA"/>).
        MLE messages thus have one of the two following formats:
          <figure align="left">

     </list>
     </t>
      <t>
        If MLE security is in use each device MUST maintain an
         outgoing frame/replay counter for use in securing outgoing packets
         in compliance with <xref target="CCM"/>.
        MLE does not include a method for configuring its own frame
         counters and so does not provide complete protection against
         replayed MLE packets.
      </t><t>
        MLE security MUST NOT use any key that is being used by the link (or
         any other) layer.
        Other than the above requirements, the distribution or derivation of
         the key(s) used for MLE security is outside the scope of this document.

   The Source Address TLV (TLV Type 0) has a Value containing
   a byte string representing a link-layer address assigned
   to the source of the message.
   A given radio interface may have multiple link-layer addresses.
   This TLV is used to communicate any source address(es) that
   is not included in the message by the link layer itself.

      <t>
   The Mode TLV (TLV Type 1) has a Value containing
   a byte string representing the mode in which this link is
   used by the source of the message.
   The format and interpretation of the mode value are
   specific to the link layer in use.
          Mode information can include such things as the sender's
           listening schedule, whether it will poll for messages,
            and so forth.

      <section title="Timeout">
      <t>
   The Timeout TLV (TLV Type 2) has a Value containing
   a 32-bit unsigned integer, most significant byte first.
   The value is the expected maximum interval between
              transmissions by the sender, in seconds.
        This allows the receiver to more accurately timeout a
          link to a neighbor that polls for its incoming messages.

      <section title="Challenge">
      <t>
   The Challenge TLV (TLV Type 3) has a Value containing

              the freshness of any reply to this message.
     The recommendations in
     <xref target="RFC4086"/>
     apply with regard to generation of the challenge value.
     A new value MUST be chose for each Challenge TLV transmitted.
          An important part of replay protection is determining
          if a newly-heard neighbor is actually present or
           is a set of recorded messages.
          This is done by sending a random challenge value to
           the neighbor and then receiving that same value
           in a Response TLV sent by the neighbor.

        Messages SHOULD be sent using UDP port X
         (value to be assigned by IANA).
        Link configuration and advertisement messages MUST be sent with
         an IP Hop Limit of 255, either to a link-local unicast address
         or to the link-local all-nodes (FF02::1) or all-routers (FF02::2)
         multicast addresses.
        Update messages MAY be sent as above,
         or MAY be sent to a site-local all-MLE-nodes
         multicast address (to be assigned by IANA).
      </t><t>
       Outgoing messages
        SHOULD be secured using the
        procedure specified in <xref target="AES"></xref> and
        <xref target="CCM"></xref> using the auxiliary security
        header as described in <xref target="IEEE802154"/>.
       Key choice is outside the scope of this document.
       The authenticated data consists of
         the following three values concatenated together:

      The secured data consists of the messages body following the
        auxiliary security header (the command ID and TLVs).
     </t><t>
       A message sent in response to a multicast request, such
        as a multicast Link Request, 
        MUST be delayed by a random time between 0 and
        MAX_RESPONSE_DELAY_TIME seconds.

        If no response is received to a request, the request
         MAY be retransmitted.
        Because MLE messages do not require complex processing
         and are not relayed, a simple timeout scheme is used
         for retransmitting.
        This is based on the retransmission mechanism used in
         DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315</xref>,

      Any incoming link configuration or advertisement message, or

       whose IP Hop Limit is not 255
       may have been forwarded by a router and MUST be discarded.
     </t><t>
      Incoming update messages that contain TLVs other than Network Parameter
       TLVs SHOULD be ignored.
     </t><t>
      Unsecured incoming messages SHOULD be ignored.
      Secured incoming messages are decrypted and authenticated using the
       procedures specified in <xref target="AES"></xref> and
       <xref target="CCM"></xref>, with security material obtained
       from the auxiliary security header as described in
       <xref target="IEEE802154"/>.
      The key source may be obtained either from the link layer source
       address or from the auxiliary security header.

      A device SHOULD maintain a separate incoming frame/replay counter for each
         neighbor.
      Any message received with a frame/replay counter the same or
       lower than that of a previously received and authenticated
       message from the same source MUST be discarded.
      Messages for which no previous frame/replay counter are available
       are not discarded and the counter value SHOULD be saved for
       comparison with later messages.

    <section title="Application to 802.15.4">
      <t>
        This section describes how MLE could be used in
         an 802.15.4-based LoWPAN.
        This section is not normative.
        The values that may need to be communicated to configure
         an 802.15.4 include:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t> Long (64-bit) and short (16-bit) addresses. </t>
          <t> Capability data byte, especially the Device Type
            and Receiver On When Idle fields. </t>
          <t> Initialization of AES-CCM frame counters (which are
            also used as replay counters). </t>
      </list>
        A device wishing to establish a link to a neighbor would
      send a Link Request message containing the following:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t> Source Address TLV, containing the sender's short (16-bit) MAC
              address.  It is assumed that the sender's long (64-bit) MAC
              address is used as the MAC source address of the message.</t>
          <t> Mode TLV, containing the sender's Capability data byte. </t>
          <t> Timeout TLV, if the sender is an rxOffWhenIdle device. </t>
          <t> Challenge TLV, whose size is determined by the network
              configuration.</t>
      </list>
        If the neighbor has sufficient resources to maintain an additional
         link, it would respond with a Link Accept message containing the
         same TLVs (with its own values), but with a Response TLV in place
         of the Challenge TLV and with an added Replay Counter TLV.
        If the neighbor also required a liveness check, it would include
         its own challenge, and use the Link Accept And Request message
         type.
      </t><t>
        If a node receives a secured 802.15.4 unicast from a neighbor
         for whom it does not have link configuration data,
         the receiving node should respond with a Link Reject message to
         inform the neighbor that the link is not configured.
      </t><t>
        Nodes could also send out periodic advertisements containing
         the incoming IDR values for their neighbors.
        These would be used to choose likely candidates for
         link establishment and to determine if existing links
         continued to provide sufficient two-way reliability.
      </t><t>
        Because link configuration and advertisement messages are used to
         establish 802.15.4 security they should
         not be secured at the 802.15.4 layer.
      </t><t>
        Update messages may be sent to change the channel, PAN ID, and/or
         permit joining flags on all nodes.
        The permit joining flag normally defaults to false; to avoid permanently
         enabling joining, the value of the permit
         joining parameter should be the number of seconds for which the permit
         joining flag should be turned on, and not just true or false.

   <t> In general MLE has the strengths and weaknesses of the
     link layer security that it inherits.
     The one exception is that MLE's operation requires accepting and
      acting on incoming Advertisements and Link Requests messages for
      which the receiver has no prior knowledge of the sender's MLE
      replay counter.
     In other words, MLE lacks the security configuration that
      it provides for link-layer security.
     Because of this, implementers must be careful in how they use
      information obtained from these possibly-replayed messages.
     For example, information from unsecured messages should
      not be used to modify any stored information obtained from
      secured messages.
    </t><t>
   The Hop Limit field of all received packets is verified to contain
   255, the maximum legal value.  Because routers decrement the Hop
   Limit on all packets they forward, received packets containing a Hop
   Limit of 255 must have originated from a neighbor.  This technique
   is borrowed from IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
