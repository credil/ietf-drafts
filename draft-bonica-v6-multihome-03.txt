    Multihoming with IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6)
                      draft-bonica-v6-multihome-03

Abstract

   RFC 6296 introduces IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6).
   By deploying NPTv6, a site can achieve addressing independence
   without contributing to excessive routing table growth.  Section 2.4
   of RFC 6296 proposes an NPTv6 architecture for sites that are homed
   to multiple upstream providers.  By deploying the proposed
   architecture, a multihomed site can achieve access redundancy and
   load balancing, in addition to addressing independence.

   This memo proposes an alternative NPTv6 architecture for hosts that
   are homed to multiple upstream providers.  The architecture described
   herein provides transport-layer survivability, in addition to the
   benefits mentioned above.  In order to provide transport-layer
   survivability, the architecture described herein requires a small
   amount of additional configuration.

   This memo updates RFC 6296.

Internet-Draft            Multihoming With NPT6               April 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3582] establishes the following goals for IPv6 site multihoming:

         Redundancy - A site's ability to remain connected to the
         Internet, even when connectivity through one or more of its
         upstream providers fails.

         Transport-Layer Survivability - A site's ability to maintain
         transport-layer sessions across failover and restoration
         events.  During a failover/restoration event, the transport-
         layer session may detect packet loss or reordering, but neither
         of these cause the transport-layer session to fail.

         Load Sharing - The ability of a site to distribute both inbound
         and outbound traffic across its upstream providers.

   [RFC3582] notes that a multihoming solution may require interactions
   with the routing subsystem.  However, multihoming solutions must be
   simple and scalable.  They must not require excessive operational
   effort and must not cause excessive routing table expansion.

   [RFC6296] explains how a site can achieve address independence using
   IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6).  In order to achieve
   address independence, the site assigns an inside address to each of
   its resources (e.g., hosts).  Nodes outside of the site identify
   those same resources using a corresponding Provider Allocated (PA)
   address.

   The site resolves this addressing dichotomy by deploying an NPTv6
   translator between itself and its upstream provider.  The NPTv6
   translator maintains a static, one-to-one mapping between each inside
   address and its corresponding PA address.  That mapping persists
   across flows and over time.

   If the site disconnects from one upstream provider and connects to
   another, it may lose its PA assignment.  However, the site will not
   need to renumber its resources.  It will only need to reconfigure the
   mapping rules on its local NPTv6 translator.

   Section 2.4 of [RFC6296] describes an NPTv6 architecture for sites
   that are homed to multiple upstream providers.  While that
   architecture fulfills many of the goals identified by [RFC3582], it
   does not achieve transport-layer survivability.  Transport-layer
   survivability is not achieved because in this architecture, a PA
   address is usable only when the multi-homed site is directly
   connected to the allocating provider.

Internet-Draft            Multihoming With NPT6               April 2012


   This memo describes an alternative architecture for multihomed sites
   that require transport-layer survivability.  It updates Section 2.4
   of [RFC6296].  In this architecture, PA addresses remain usable, even
   when the multihomed site loses its direct connection to the
   allocating provider.

   The architecture described in this document can be deployed in sites
   that are served by two or more upstream providers.  For the purpose
   of example, this document demonstrates how the architecture can be
   deployed in a site that is served by two upstream providers.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

      inbound packet - A packet that is destined for the multi-homed
      site

      outbound packet - A packet that originates at the multi-homed site
      and is destined for a point outside of the multi-homed site

      NPTv6 inside interface - An interface that connects an NPTv6
      translator to the site

      NPTv6 outside interface- An interface that connects an NPTv6
      translator to an upstream provider


2.  NPTv6 Deployment

   This section demonstrates how NPTv6 can be deployed in order to
   achieve the goals of [RFC3582].

                               Internal Network


                    Figure 1: NPTv6 Multihomed Topology

   In Figure 1, a site attaches all of its assets, including two NPTv6
   translators, to an Internal Network.  NPTv6 #1 is connected to
   Provider Edge (PE) Router #1, which is maintained by Upstream
   Provider #1.  Likewise, NPTv6 #2 is connected to PE Router #2, which
   is maintained by Upstream Provider #2.

   Each upstream provider also maintains a Backup PE Router.  A
   forwarding tunnel connects the loopback interface of Backup PE Router
   #1 to the outside interface of NPTv6 #2.  Another forwarding tunnel
   connects Backup PE Router #2 to NPTv6 #1.  Network operators can
   select from many encapsulation techniques (e.g., GRE) to realize the
   forwarding tunnels.  Tunnels are depicted as dotted lines in
   Figure 1.

   In the figure, NPTv6 #1 and NPTv6 #2 are depicted as separate boxes.
   While vendors may produce a separate box to support the NPTv6
   function, they may also integrate the NPTv6 function into a router.

   During periods of normal operation, the Backup PE routers is very
   lightly loaded.  Therefore, a single Backup PE router may back up
   multiple PE routers.  Furthermore, the Backup PE router may be used
   for other purposes (e.g., primary PE router for another customer).

2.2.  Addressing

2.2.1.  Upstream Provider Addressing

   A Regional Internet Registry (RIR) allocates Provider Address Block
   (PAB) #1 to Upstream Provider #1.  From PAB #1, Upstream Provider #1
   allocates two sub-blocks, using them as follows.

   Upstream Provider #1 uses the first sub-block to number its internal
   interfaces.  It also uses that sub-block to number the interfaces
   that connect it to its customers.

   Upstream Provider #1 uses the second sub-block for customer address
   assignments.  We refer to a particular assignment from this sub-block
   as a Customer Network Block (CNB).  In this case, Upstream Provider
   #1 assigns CNB #1 to the multihomed site.  For the purpose of
   example, assume that CNB #1 is a /59.

   In a similar fashion, a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) allocates
   PAB #2 to Upstream Provider #2.  Upstream Provider #2, in turn,
   assigns CNB #2 to the multihomed site.  For the purpose of example,
   assume that CNB #2 is a /60.

   The multihomed site does not number any of its interfaces from CNB #1
   or CNB #2.  Section 2.3 describes how the multihomed site uses CNB #1
   and CNB #2.

2.2.2.  Site Addressing

   The site obtains a Site Address Block (SAB), either from Unique Local
   Address (ULA) [RFC4193] space, or by some other means.  For the
   purpose of example, assume that the site obtains a /48 from ULA
   space.

   The site then draws a /59 prefix and a /60 prefix from the SAB.  In
   this document, we call those prefixes SAB #1 and SAB #2.  Note that
   SAB #1 and CNB #1 are both /59 prefixes.  Likewise, SAB #2 and CNB #2
   are both /60 prefixes.  In Section 2.3, the site will map SAB #1 to
   CNB #1 and SAB #2 to CNB #2.  Mapped prefixes must be of identical
   size.

   The site then numbers its resources from SAB #1 and SAB #2.  SAB #1
   and SAB #2 are the only usable portions of the SAB, because they are
   the only prefixes that will be mapped to CNB addresses.

   During periods of normal operation, hosts that are numbered from SAB
   #1 receive inbound traffic from Upstream Provider #1.  Hosts that are
   numbered from SAB #2 receive inbound traffic from Upstream Provider

   #2.  Selected hosts receive inbound traffic from both upstream
   providers, balancing the load between them.  These hosts have
   multiple addresses, with at least one address being drawn from SAB #1
   and at least one address being drawn from SAB #2.

   Section 2.7 explains how load balancing is achieved.

2.3.  Address Translation

   Both NPTv6 translators are configured with the following rules:

         For outbound packets, if the first 59 bits of the source
         address identify SAB #1, overwrite those 59 bits with the 59
         bits that identify CNB #1

         For outbound packets, if the first 60 bits of the source
         address identify SAB #2, overwrite those 60 bits with the 60
         bits that identify CNB #2

         For outbound packets, if none of the conditions above are met,
         silently discard the packet

         For inbound packets, if the first 59 bits of the destination
         address identify CNB #1, overwrite those 59 bits with the 59
         bits that identify SAB #1

         For inbound packets, if the first 60 bits of the destination
         address identify CNB #2, overwrite those 60 bits with the 60
         bits that identify SAB #2

         For inbound packets, if none of the conditions above are met,
         silently discard the packet

   Due to the nature of the rules described above, NPTv6 translation is
   stateless.  Therefore, traffic flows do not need to be symmetric
   across NPTv6 translators.  Furthermore, a traffic flow can shift from
   one NPTv6 translator to another without causing transport-layer
   session failure.

2.4.  Domain Name System (DNS)

   In order to make all site resources reachable by domain name
   [RFC1034], the site publishes AAAA records [RFC3596] associating each
   resource with all of its CNB addresses.  While this DNS architecture
   is sufficient, it is suboptimal.  Traffic that both originates and
   terminates within the site traverses NPTv6 translators needlessly.
   Several optimizations are available.  These optimizations are well
   understood and have been applied to [RFC1918] networks for many

   years.

2.5.  Routing

   Upstream Provider #1 uses an Interior Gateway Protocol to flood
   topology information throughout its domain.  It also uses BGP
   [RFC4271] to distribute customer and peer reachability information.

   PE #1 acquires a route to CNB #1 with NEXT-HOP equal to the outside
   interface of NPTv6 #1.  PE #1 can either learn this route from a
   single-hop eBGP session with NPTv6 #1, or acquire it through static
   configuration.  In either case, PE #1 overwrites the NEXT-HOP of this
   route with its own loopback address and distributes the route
   throughout Upstream Provider #1 using iBGP.  The LOCAL PREF for this
   route is set high, so that the route will be preferred to alternative
   routes to CNB #1.  Upstream Provider #1 does not distribute this
   route to CNB #1 outside of its own borders because it is part of the
   larger aggregate PAB #1, which is itself advertised.

   NPTv6 #1 acquires a default route with NEXT-HOP equal to the directly
   connected interface on PE #1.  NPTv6 #1 can either learn this route
   from a single-hop eBGP session with PE #1, or acquire it through
   static configuration.

   Similarly, Backup PE #1 acquires a route to CNB #1 with NEXT-HOP
   equal to the outside interface of NPTv6 #2.  Backup PE #1 can either
   learn this route from a multi-hop eBGP session with NPTv6 #2, or
   acquire it through static configuration.  In either case, Backup PE
   #1 overwrites the NEXT-HOP of this route with its own loopback
   address and distributes the route throughout Upstream Provider #1
   using iBGP.  Distribution procedures are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-best-external].  The LOCAL PREF for this route is set
   low, so that the route will not be preferred to alternative routes to
   CNB #1.  Upstream Provider #1 does not distribute this route to CNB
   #1 outside of its own borders.

   Even if Backup PE #1 maintains an eBGP session NPTv6 #2, it does not
   advertise the default route through that eBGP session.  During
   failures, Backup PE #1 does not attract outbound traffic to itself.

   PE #2 acquires a route to CNB #1 with NEXT-HOP equal to the outside
   interface of NPTv6 #2.  PE #2 can either learn this route from a
   single-hop eBGP session with NPTv6 #2, or acquire it through static
   configuration.  PE #2 uses this route to enforce source address
   filtering [RFC2827] on the interface through which it is connected to
   NPTv6 #2.  PE #2 does not advertise this route to CNB #1 to any or
   its routing peers.

   Finally, the Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR) contained by
   Upstream Provider #1 maintain eBGP sessions with their peers.  The
   ASBRs advertise only PAB #1 through those eBGP sessions.  Upstream
   Provider #1 does not advertise any of the following to its eBGP
   peers:

         any prefix that is contained by PAB #1 (i.e., more specific)

         PAB #2 or any part thereof

         the SAB or any part thereof

   Upstream Provider #2 is configured in a manner analogous to that
   described above.

   Because both NPTv6 gateways are configured with identical translation
   rules, and because both PE routers maintain routes to CNB #1 and CNB
   #1, outbound packets can traverse either NPTv6 gateway.  Outbound
   routing is controlled by the site and therefore, is beyond the scope
   of this document.

2.6.  Failure Detection and Recovery

   When PE #1 loses its route to CNB #1, it withdraws its iBGP
   advertisement for that prefix from Upstream Provider #1.  The route
   advertised by Backup PE #1 remains and Backup PE #1 attracts traffic
   bound for CNB #1 to itself.  Backup PE #1 forwards that traffic
   through the tunnel to NPTv6 #2.  NPTv6 #2 performs translations and
   delivers the traffic to the Internal Network.

   Likewise, when NPTv6 #1 loses its default route, it makes itself
   unavailable as a gateway for other hosts on the Internal Network.
   NPTv6 #2 attracts all outbound traffic to itself and forwards that
   traffic through Upstream Provider #2.  Because PE #2 maintains routes
   to both CNB #1 and CNB #2, it does not discard any traffic from CNB
   #1 or CNB #2 as a result of source address filtering.  The mechanism
   by which NPTv6 #1 makes itself unavailable as a gateway is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   If PE #1 maintains a single-hop eBGP session with NPTv6 #1, the
   failure of that eBGP session will cause both routes mentioned above
   to be lost.  Otherwise, another failure detection mechanism such as
   BFD [RFC5881] is required.

   Regardless of the failure detection mechanism, inbound traffic
   traverses the tunnel only during failure periods and outbound traffic
   never traverses the tunnel.  Furthermore, restoration is localized.
   As soon as the advertisement for CNB #1 is withdrawn throughout

   Upstream Provider #1, restoration is complete.

   Transport-layer connections survive Failure/Recovery events because
   both NPTv6 translators implement identical translation rules.  When a
   traffic flow shifts from one translator to another, neither the
   source address nor the destination address changes.

2.7.  Load Balancing

   Outbound load balancing is controlled by the site and is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   For inbound traffic, addressing determines load balancing.  If a host
   is numbered from SAB #1, its address is mapped into CNB #1, which is
   announced only by Upstream Provider #1 (as part of PAB #1).
   Therefore, during periods of normal operation, all traffic bound for
   that host traverses Upstream Provider #1 and NPTv6 #1.  Likewise, if
   a host is numbered from SAB #2, its address is mapped into CNB #2,
   which is announced only by Upstream Provider #2 (as part of PAB #2).
   Therefore, during periods of normal operation, all traffic bound for
   that host traverses Upstream Provider #2 and NPTv6 #2.

   Selected hosts receive inbound traffic from both upstream providers,
   balancing load between them.  These hosts have multiple addresses,
   with at least one address being drawn from SAB #1 and at least one
   address being drawn from SAB #2.  The number of addresses drawn from
   each range determines how connections originating outside of the
   multihomed site distribute inbound load.

   Recall that all CNB addresses associated with a host are published in
   DNS.  When a remote host initiates a TCP connection, it selects from
   among these addresses in a relatively random manner.  If it selects
   an address from CNB #1, inbound packets belonging to that connection
   will traverse Upstream Provider #1 and NPTv6 #1.  If it selects an
   address from CNB #2, inbound packets belonging to that connection
   will traverse Upstream Provider #2 and NPTv6 #2.

   When the multiply addressed host initiates a connection, it
   associates one of its own addresses with the connection.  If the
   address that it chooses is from SAB #1, that address will be mapped
   to a CNB #1 address and return traffic will traverse Upstream
   Provider #1 and NPTv6 #1.  Alternatively, if the host selects an
   address from SAB #2, that address will be mapped to a CNB #2 address
   and return traffic will traverse Upstream Provider #1 and NPTv6 #2.

3.  Discussion

   When compared to the multihoming architecture described in Section
   2.4 of [RFC6296], the proposed architecture achieves transport-layer
   survivability at the cost of backup PE hardware and additional
   configuration.  The cost of backup PE hardware is minimal, because
   backup PE routers are very lightly loaded during periods of normal
   operation.  However, in the example provided above, Upstream Provider
   #1 must configure the following additional items:

   o  an interface to the multihomed site on Backup PE #1

   o  a forwarding tunnel connecting that interface to NPTv6 #2

   o  either a multi-hop eBGP session between Backup PE #1 and NPTv6 #2,
      or a static route to CNB #1 on Backup PE #1

   Furthermore, if PE #1 does not maintain an eBGP session with NPTv6
   #1, Upstream Provider #1 must configure a static route to CNB #2 (as
   well as CNB #1) on PE #1.  However, if PE #1 does maintain an eBGP
   session with NPTv6 #1, Upstream Provider #1 must configure policy on
   that session causing it to accept, but not readvertise a path to CNB
   #2.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.


5.  Security Considerations

   As with any architecture that modifies source and destination
   addresses, the operation of access control lists, firewalls and
   intrusion detection systems may be impacted.  Also many users may
   confuse NPTv6 translation with a NAT.  Two limitations of NAT are
   that a) it does not support incoming connections without special
   configuration and b) it requires symmetric routing across the NAT
   device.  Many users understood these limitations to be security
   features.  Because NPTv6 has neither of these limitations, it also
   offers neither of these features.
