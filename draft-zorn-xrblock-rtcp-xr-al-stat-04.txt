1.  Introduction

   RFC 3611 [RFC3611] defines seven report block formats for network
   management and quality monitoring.  However, some of these metrics
   are mostly for multicast inference of network characteristics (MINC)
   or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring and not widely applicable to other
   applications, e.g., video quality monitoring.  This document focuses
   on specifying new additional report block types used to convey loss,
   duplication and discard summary statistics that are generically
   designed for use in audio and video services.

   The metrics belong to both the class of application layer metrics and
   transport layer metrics defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).

1.1.  Applicability

   The Report Blocks defined in this document can be applied to any
   real-time applications that convey loss, duplication and discard
   summary statistics.


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Picture Type

      Picture types used in the different video algorithms compose of
      the key-frame and the Derivation frame.  Key-frame is also called
      a reference frame and used as a reference for predicting other
      pictures.  It is coded without prediction from other pictures.
      The Derivation frame is derived from Key-frame using prediction
      from the reference frame.



3.  Transport Layer Metrics

3.1.  Burst/Gap Loss Summsary Statistics Block

   The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
   this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement

   Information block (which MUST be present in the same RTCP packet as
   the Burst/Gap Loss block) and also with the metric "cumulative number
   of packets lost" provided in standard RTCP [RFC3550].

3.1.2.  Definition of Fields in Loss Summary Statistics Block

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      Burst/Gap Loss Summsary Statistics Block is identified by the
      constant <BGLSS>.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the metrics block is an
      Interval or a Cumulative report,

   reserved: 7 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].

   Burst Loss Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets lost during bursts since the beginning of
      reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point
      at the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by
      dividing Packets Discarded in Bursts by Total Packets expected in
      Bursts as follows:

      Packets Loss in Bursts / Total Packets expected in Bursts

   Gap Loss Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets lost during gaps since the beginning of
      reception expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point
      at the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by
      dividing the difference between number of packets lost and Packets
      lost in Bursts by the difference between Packets Expected and
      Total Packets expected in Bursts as follows:

      (number of packets lost - Packets Lost in Bursts) / (Packets
      Expected - Total Packets expected in Bursts)

      where "number of packets lost" is obtained from standard RTCP
      [RFC3550] and Packets Expected is calculated as the difference
      between "extended last sequence number" and "extended first
      sequence number" (Interval or Cumulative) provided in the
      Measurement Identity and Information block [MEASIDENT].

      Note that if the metric is to be calculated on an Interval basis,
      a difference must be taken between the current and preceding
      values of "cumulative number of packets lost" in RTCP, to obtain
      the "number of packets lost" for the reporting interval.

   Burst duration Mean:16bits

      The mean burst duration is obtained as the quotient:

      mean = Sum of Burst Durations / Number of Bursts

      where " Sum of Burst Durations " and "Number of Bursts"is obtained
      from the RTCP XR Burst/Gap Discard Block.

   Burst Duration Variance:16bits

      The variance of the burst duration is obtained using the standard
      result:

      var = ( Sum of Squares of Burst Durations - Number of Bursts *

      mean^2 ) / (Number of Bursts - 1)

      where " Sum of Squares of Burst Durations " and "Number of
      Bursts"is obtained from the RTCP XR Burst/Gap Discard Block.


3.2.  Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block

   The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
   this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
   Identity block (which MUST be present in the same RTCP packet as the
   Burst/Gap Discard block) and also with the metric "number of packets
   discarded" provided in the RTCP XR Discard Block [DISCARD].  The RTCP
   XR Discard Block SHOULD be sent if the Burst/Gap Discard block is
   sent, but the converse does not apply.

3.2.2.  Definition of Fields in Discard Summary Statistics Block

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block is identified by the
      constant <BGDSS>.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].

   Burst Discard Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets discarded during bursts since the
      beginning of reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the
      binary point at the left edge of the field.  This value is
      calculated by dividing Packets Discarded in Bursts by Total
      Packets expected in Bursts as follows:

      Packets Discarded in Bursts / Total Packets expected in Bursts

   Gap Discard Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets discarded during gaps since the beginning
      of reception expressed as a fixed point number with the binary
      point at the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by
      dividing the difference between number of packets discarded and
      Packets Discarded in Bursts by the difference between Packets
      Expected and Total Packets expected in Bursts as follows:

      (number of packets discarded - Packets Discarded in Bursts) /
      (Packets Expected - Total Packets expected in Bursts)

      where "number of packets discarded" is obtained from the RTCP XR
      Discard Block [DISCARD] and Packets Expected is calculated as the
      difference between "extended last sequence number" and "extended
      first sequence number" (Interval or Cumulative) provided in the
      Measurement Information block [MEASIDENT].

      identified by the constant <ALDSS>.

   Picture type indicator (T): 1 bit

      Picture types used in the different video algorithms compose of
      key-frame and derivation frame.  This field is used to indicate
      the frame type to be reported.  Bits set to 0 if the lost_frames
      field or dup_frames field contain a key_frame report or reference
      frame report, 1 if the lost_frames field and dup_frames field
      contain other derivation frame report.

      If no frames have been received then this count shall be set to
      Zero.

   lost_full_frames: 32 bits

      If one frame is completely lost, this frame is regarded as one
      lost full_frame.  The lost_full_frames is equivalent to the number
      of lost_full_frames in the above sequence number interval.

   dup_frames: 32 bits

      Number of dup_frames in the above sequence number interval.

   lost_partial_frames: 32 bits

      If one frame is partially lost, this frame is regarded as one lost
      fractional frame.  The lost_partial_frames is equivalent to the
      number of lost_partial_frames in the above sequence number
      interval.



5.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing three additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.
