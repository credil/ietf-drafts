1.  Introduction

   Software Defined Networking is now a term that different players may
   express different opinions.  Yet despite all that, the separate of
   data and control via the use of controller and generic forwarding
   devices is the key component of this architecture.  In this
   architecture, as depicted in Figure 1, the controller system exposes
   APIs to the upper layer SDN applications, while communicating with
   the data plane devices using protocols like Openflow and OVSDB.  The
   data plane devices in this architecture include both physical devices
   and virtual devices that connect virtual machines.

2.  Terminology

   Serveral Terms are defined in this document.

   SDN Controller Cluster (SCC): an integrated system that manages a
   large scale production network and handles control plane
   communications with a big number of data plane devices.  SCC normally
   consists of a cluster of controllers which exposes outside as a
   logically integrated entity.

   Controller Instance (CoIN): an instance of a controller, multiple
   CoINs consists the SCC.

   South-bound Interface: the interface that implements a certain type
   of protocols for communication with the data plane devices.

   North-bound interface: the interface exposed to the upper layer
   applications, normally APIs to abstract the functions supported by
   the SCC.

   West-East Interface: the interface between different CoINs.  The
   West-East Interface is considered as internal, without need of
   exposing to the outside.

3.  SDN Controller Cluster Analysis

   This section reviews and analyzes the SDN Controller Cluster from two
   aspects including protocols, functionalities.

3.1.  Protocol Aspect

   We will take Openflow as an example of the south-bound interface in
   the following description if no additional notes apply.

   The OpenFlow protocol supports three message types, controller-to-
   switch, asynchronous, and symmetric.

      Controller-to-switch messages are initiated by the controller and
      used to directly manage or inspect the state of the switch.

      Asynchronous messages are initiated by the switch and used to
      update the controller of network events and changes to the switch
      state

      Symmetric messages are initiated by either the switch or the
      controller and sent without solicitation.

Internet-Draft                  SDN CODE                       July 2013


   Controller-to-switch messages are generally trigger by the upper
   layer SDN applications to manage and acquire the state of the switch.
   A scalable SDN Controller Cluster MUST support a reasonable number of
   connections from SDN applications.  And if necessary, the SCC SHOULD
   check the conflicts therein.

   SCC is the responder of synchronous messages.  Considering the number
   of data plane devices in the large-scale production networks, the
   number of connections the SCC could support is a big impactor to the
   real life performance.  And when the switch does not find a match in
   its local flow table for a packet, the packet is forwarded to the SCC
   as an attachment, which will add to more processing presure.

   Symmetric messages include HELLO, ECHO and Experimental extensions.
   These messages do not incur much state keeping and handling logics,
   so do not put much presure on the SCC.

   In addtion to the above analysis, the south bound interface normally
   requires a pre-established secure connections (e.g., Openflow uses
   SSL), each of which consumes computing resources on the SCC.

3.2.  Functionality Aspect

   From the functionalities aspects, the SCC SHOULD at least supports
   the following items.

   1.  North-bound API.  The abstraction of the services that the SCC
       can provide to upper layer applications.

   2.  Route Computing.  The essential function that the SCC provides to
       compute routes so that the results can be written to the data
       plane devices via the south-bound interface.

   3.  Consistent Data Store.  The required data storage to assist SCC
       functioning correctly.  Consistency is a key requirement so that
       multiple requesters get the consistent results possibly processed
       by different controller instances (CoIN).  Should expose
       necessary APIs for queries and retrievals.

   4.  Topology Management.  Including topology discovery, maintenance
       and regular updates.

   5.  West-East Communication.  The internal communication between
       different CoINs.  Distributed system techniques may apply here.

   6.  Structured Logging, naming logging services.  Logging data SHOULD
       be stored distributedly.

   7.  Security module, to avoid malicious flow requests to flood the
       controller.

   8.  South-bound Adaption.  Adaption layer to support multiple south-
       bound protocols such as Openflow, ForCES, OVSDB, etc.

   From the above analysis, the SCC functional image can be depicted as
   below.

5.  Benchmarks and Open Questions

   This section lists the open questions for future studies of SDN
   controller in large scale production networks.

   We try to list the benchmarks used for a controller system.

   1.  Availability benchmarks.

       a.  flow requests per second

       b.  API calls per second

       c.  topology discovery delay, could be depicted using second per
           port or second per thousand flows.

       d.  number of concurrent connections between the controller and
           devices.

   2.  Scalability benchmarks, this particularly investigates the
       relationship between two of more metrics

       a.  API call latency vs. number of API calls per second

       b.  topology discovery delay vs. network scale (flow size or
           device number, or concurrent connections )

       c.  flow request delay vs. network scale

       d.  route computing delay vs. network scale

   3.  Reliability benchmarks.

       a.  Link and switch failures

       b.  COINs failures.

   4.  Consistency benchmarks.

       a.  probability of inconsistent query results

       b.  latency of updating the whole COINs DHT

6.  Related Work

   Many studies are around the problem of a scalable and reliable
   controller platform.  NOX [NOX] is a simple openflow controller and
   it is single threaded.  Materoo [Maestro] achieves a simple
   programming model for control function development by having a
   single-threaded event-loop and it was demonstrated that Materoo can
   achieve linear scalability.  Onix [ONIX] is a platform on top of
   which a network control plane can be implemented as a distributed
   system.  Onix adopts DHT (Distributed Hast Table) techniques for its
   extensibility.  The 'Controller Placement Problem' was also proposed
   for large production networks [Placement].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any IANA requests.

8.  Security Considerations

   The SDN security requirements are specified in
   [I-D.hartman-sdnsec-requirements], and the security analysis of
   Openflow is presented in [I-D.mrw-sdnsec-openflow-analysis] .
