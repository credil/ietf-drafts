Abstract

   This document describes a service chaining mechanism, which is used
   to indicate the data packets going through multiple Service
   Processing Entities and processed by those Service Processing
   Entities with preset order. This document also provides a new service
   chaining header encapsulation for packets in a service chain. The
   system can get the information of the next Service Processing Entity
   where the data packet should go by checking the service chaining
   header.

1. Introduction

   Service chaining is a technology to direct packets going through one
   or more Service Processing Entities (SPE). A service chaining network
   includes one or multiple Service Forwarding Entities (SFE) where SPEs
   are attached to. Service chaining architecture is defined in [draft-
   jiang-service-chaining-arch].

   SPE provides enhanced service processing such as load balancing, NAT,
   network firewall, or URL filtering.

Internet-Draft    Service Chaining Header and its Mechanism   July 2013


   In this document, a SFE provides the following service chaining
   functions:

   - classify original data packet based on service characteristics (may
   be mapped to tuples of the packet), and add a service chaining header
   in front of the packet. A packet with a service chaining header is
   called a service chaining packet.

   - forward service chaining packets between SPE and SFE or between SFE
   and SFE, based on the service chaining forwarding table.

   - remove service chaining header from a service chaining packet after
   the last SPE finishing service processing, recover the original
   packet, and send it out based on traditional forwarding mechanism
   such as IP forwarding.



2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



3. Terminology

   Service Processing Entity (SPE):  a logical entity which can provide
   one or more service processing functions for packets/frames such as
   firewall, DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), LI (Lawful Intercept) and etc.
   Usually these processing functions are computation intensive. This
   entity may also provide packet/frame encapsulation/decapsulation
   capability.

   Service Forwarding Entity (SFE): a logical entity which forwards
   packets/frames to one or more SPEs in a same service chain.
   Optionally, it provides mapping, insertion and removal of header(s)
   in packets/frames. Note service forwarding path may not be the
   shortest path to its destination.

   Service Chaining Header: a header in front of packet, added by a SFE.
   SFE uses service chaining header information to forward service
   chaining packet.

   Service Chaining Packet: an original packet added with a service
   chaining header.

   Underlay Network: a network conveying service chaining packet between
   SFE and SPE or between SFEs. It may be an IP network, an Ethernet
   networks, or an MPLS networks, etc.

   Service Chaining Table: Service chaining table is used to indicate
   next hop of SFE forwarding service chaining packet.



4. Service chaining header



   The service chaining header is depicted in Figure 1 below.

   o Version: represents the service chaining header version. This
      field is 4 bits long, and current version is 0x0001.

   o Reserved: this field is reserved for future extension.

   o Path ID: the path identifier, assigned for the traffic along the
      same service path in a service domain. The path ID field is set by
      SFE based on result of traffic classification or SPE processing
      result. This field is 32 bits long.

Internet-Draft    Service Chaining Header and its Mechanism   July 2013


   o Previous SPE ID: the previous SPE that has handled the packet.
      Each SPE instance is assigned a unique value for identification in
      a service chaining domain.  After processing the packet, the SPE
      will replace the previous SPE ID value with its own SPE ID in the
      service chaining header. This field is 32 bits long.

      -special value of all zero means no previous SPE for current
      packet.

   o Next SPE ID: the next SPE that will handle the packet. When SFE
      receives the packet from a SPE, it gets the next SPE ID based on
      path ID, previous SPE ID and SPE Process Result, and fills the
      next SPE ID value in Next SPE ID field. This field is 32 bits long.

      -a special value of 0xffffffff means no next SPE for current
      packet, and the SFE should remove the service chaining header.

   o SPE Process Result: the SPE process result of a packet. If the SPE
      has several different processing results for packets with the same
      Path ID, and packets can go to different next SPEs based on the
      SPE processing results.  These paths are called branch paths. The
      SPE Process Result field is filled by SPE, which is used to inform
      the SFE. The SFE then uses this value and other fields in the
      service chaining header to determine the next action to apply to
      the packet. This field is 32 bits long.

      -0x0000, a default value, indicate to SFE that the data packet
      should be kept in the same service path.



5. Service classification mechanism

   When a SFE receives an original packet at the boundary of a service
   chaining domain, it performs service classification function. The
   result of classification is used to determine the path ID of the
   service chaining header.

   The SFE adds a service chaining header for the packet that enters a
   service chaining domain:

   - set the same path ID for packets of the same service path.
   Different service paths will have different service path ID;

   -set initial SPE Process Result value to 0x00000000,

Internet-Draft    Service Chaining Header and its Mechanism   July 2013


   -set the previous SPE ID field to all zero (a special value which
   means no previous SPE for this data packet currently).

   The service classification may be based on tuples of a packet, DPI
   result of a packet, and etc.



6. Service chaining mechanism

6.1. SFE behavior

   When a SFE receives a service chaining packet from its traffic
   classifier module, from a SPE or another SFE, it performs following
   actions:

   1 get Path ID, SPE Process Result and Previous SPE ID from the
   service chaining header in this service chaining packet,

   2 look up its Service Chaining Table to get the new Path ID and next
   SPE ID.

   The Service Chaining Table should maintain the following information:

   lookup key: Path ID + Previous SPE ID + SPE Process Result

   lookup result new Path ID and next SPE ID


   3 set Path ID field of the Service Chaining Header with the new Path
   ID set Next SPE ID field of the Service Chaining Header with next SPE
   ID.

       --if next SPE ID=0xffffffff, meaning no next SPE for current
   packet, the SFE should remove the service chaining header and send
   the packet out of the service chaining domain;

   4) get underlay network address that can reach the next SPE based on
   the Next SPE ID, encapsulate a underlay network header before its
   Service Chaining Header, and send out the packet.

6.2. SPE behavior

   When a SPE receives a packet with underlay network header and service
   chaining header from a SFE, it performs service processing function,
   sets SPE Process Result field of the service chaining header based on
   the processing result, sets the Previous SPE ID of the service

Internet-Draft    Service Chaining Header and its Mechanism   July 2013


   chaining header to be the current SPE ID, encapsulates a new underlay
   network header and send the packet back to the SFE.



7. Underlay network encapsulation

   Service chaining header can be encapsulated in a UDP header or GRE
   header.

   Service chaining header can be encapsulated in a UDP header as
   following:

    +--------+--------+------------------+-----------------+
    | IP     |  UDP   | Service Chaining | Original Packet |
    | Header | Header |     Header       |                 |
    +--------+--------+------------------+-----------------+


                    Figure 2 IP/UDP as underlay network

   A special UDP port value should be assigned by IANA to identify that
   the UDP payload is a service chaining packet.

   Service chaining header can also be encapsulated in a GRE header as
   following:

       +------------+-------------------------+----------------------+
       | GRE header | Service Chaining Header | original data packet |
       +------------+-------------------------+----------------------+
                      Figure 3 GRE as underlay network

   A special GRE Protocol Type value should be assigned by IANA to
   identify that the GRE payload is a service chaining packet.



8. Security Considerations

   It will be considered in a future revision.

Internet-Draft    Service Chaining Header and its Mechanism   July 2013


9. IANA Considerations

   If using IP/UDP as underlay network, a specific UDP port value should
   be assigned by IANA to identify the UDP payload is service chaining
   packet.
   If using GRE as underlay network, a specific GRE protocol type should
   be assigned by IANA to identify the GRE payload is service chaining
   packet.
