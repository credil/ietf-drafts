    <abstract>
      <t>Network configuration of hosts is currently relatively static with
      little consideration of dynamic network characteristics. The network
      infrastructure is aware of dynamic network characteristics. This
      specification extends DHCPv6 so that the DHCPv6 relay agent can
      influence a host's configuration.</t>

      <!--
      <t>The network infrastructure is often aware of network characteristics

      <t>This document defines new DHCPv6 Relay Options so that the network
      infrastructure can communicate network characteristics to the DHCPv6
      server, allowing the DHCPv6 server to configure the host using this
      additional information.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>DHCPv6 allows relatively static information to be configured in
      hosts, which is somewhat limiting. On a dynamic network, the DHCPv6
      relay agent can observe characteristics of a network -- such as IPv6
      multihoming which might be temporarily unavailable or need load
      balancing of traffic towards each upstream ISPs. By including additional
      information in relayed DHCPv6 messages, the DHCPv6 relay agent can
      influence the DHCPv6 server to provide answers that are better suited to
      the host's configuration on the network.</t>

      <t>In this document we propose new DHCPv6 options to be added by the
      DHCPv6 relay agent when it generates a Relay-Forwarded message. These
      new DHCPv6 options convey information about the host and about dynamic
      network characteristics to influence the DHCPv6 server to generate a
      reply that is appropriate for that host and the current network
      characteristics.</t>

      <t>An initial desire is to influence the DHCPv6 server's responses that
      modify the host's address policy table <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-opt"/> based on observed network
      characteristics.</t>

    <section anchor="usage_scenarios" title="Usage Scenarios">
      <t>The DHCPv6 extension described in this document is useful with IPv6
      multihoming and with IP address-based authentication.</t>

      <section anchor="IPv6_multihoming" title="IPv6 Multihoming">
        <t>There are three multihoming scenarios where the Absolute Precedence
        option is useful.</t>

        <t>The first scenario is in Proxy Mobile IPv6 <xref target="RFC5213"/>
        where Mobile Node is assigned prefixes from both local access network
        and home network. This will allow selected traffic to go through the
        Mobile Packet Core and the rest through the Local access Network. When
        DHCPv6 Relay Agent is co-located with the mobile access gateway, the
        proposal is for the relay agent to influence the DHCPv6 Server in the
        home network by adding the Absolute Precedence option. The relay agent
        can add an Absolute Precedence option to the DHCPv6 request suggesting
        the desired label for prefix assigned by the local access network and
        labels for destination prefixes reachable from the local access
        network without going through the home network. The following figure
        depicts this scenario.</t>

        <t>The second scenario is in multihoming with provider-aggregatable
        (PA) address space, a host is given an IPv6 address from each ISP. It
        is often desirable to provide some load balancing between those ISPs.
        This can be accomplished by the relay agent using the Absolute
        Precedence option described in the document. The relay agent can add
        an Absolute Precedence option to the DHCPv6 request suggesting the
        desired source prefix and prioritized destination prefixes as per the
        network's load balancing schema. ISP destination prefixes can be
        prioritized by setting Precedence value in the Absolute Precedence
        option, i.e the prefix with higher precedence will be preferred over
        the prefix with lower precedence.</t>

        <t>The third scenario is when a private link exists between two
        businesses, it can be desirable for certain high-value traffic to use
        that link rather than using the Internet. To use this link, the host
        needs to prefer the IPv6 prefix that causes its traffic to be routed
        on that link. Policy may influence which hosts are supposed to use
        that link (e.g., access type, time of day).</t>

        <t>For example consider two sites, A and B, which are connected to the
        Internet and also have a private, high-speed link between them. Site A
        has prefix 2001:aaaa:aaaa::/48 from the high-performance network and
        prefix 2007:0:aaaa::/48 from its Internet-connected service provider.
        Site B has prefix 2001:bbbb:bbbb::/48 from the high-performance
        network and prefix 2007:0:bbbb::/48 from its Internet-connected
        service provider. The high-performance ISP is expensive and the two
        sites wish to use it only for their business-critical traffic with
        each other. All hosts have two IPv6 addresses and two AAAA records in
        DNS. Using the new DHCPv6 options described in this document, the DHCP
        relay agent would determine a host should be allowed to use the
        high-performance link, so the DHCPv6 relay agent would add the
        Absolute Precedence Option to the DHCPv6 request from that host. The
        Absolute Precedence Option would set a higher precedence for the
        high-speed prefix, destination prefix 2001:bbbb:bbbb::/48. This would
        request the DHCPv6 server return a response that influences the host's
        prefix policy table.</t>

        <t>Discussion: The second scenario seems solvable by grouping hosts
        into separate VLANs. However, this is undesirable because segregating
        using VLANs becomes cumbersome with a large number of VLANs. It also
        required to configure static policy tables in the DHCPv6 server for
        each VLAN, which is not commonly done today. This problem can be
        better solved using the Absolute Precedence option defined in this
        document. Based on various attributes, the relay agent could add an
        Absolute Precedence option to the DHCPv6 request indicating the
        desired source prefixes to be assigned based on the host
        characteristics and destination prefixes with precedence value set
        accordingly to pick the right link thus providing a cleaner solution
        to the problem.</t>

               title="Disabling IPv6 Temporary Addresses">
        <section title="Avoiding Excessive IP-Based Authentication">
          <t>Some managed networks authenticate hosts with an authentication
          supplicant or, for hosts lacking the supplicant, address-based
          authentication. When Address-based authentication is used,
          re-authentication occurs for each address obtained by the host,
          which can create a lot of authentication transactions. To reduce
          this chatter, it can be useful to disable <xref
          target="RFC4941">IPv6 Privacy Addresses</xref> on those hosts using
          address-based authentication. In a managed network, this option will
          ensure that temporary addresses are disabled for hosts without
          authentication supplicant. This way managed networks can
          conditionally disable temporary addressess for only a set of
          hosts.</t>

          <t>The relay agent may be configured with the external prefixes that
          will be assigned to the host. In that case, the relay agent would
          use the Absolute Prefecedence option. In the case where the relay
          agent is unaware of the external prefixes that will be assigned to
          the host, the relay agent uses the Relative Precedence option.
          Details for processing those options are described later in the
          document.</t>

          <t>Whenever either of those options is used, a DHCPv6 server that
          understands those options will ignore the IA_TA options in the
          DHCPv6 request, effectively disabling the use of temporary addresses
          for that host.</t>

      <t>Relay-Supplied Prefix option carries host and network information

      DHCPv6 relay agent expects the DHCPv6 server to provide to the host,
      useful for load balancing among multiple IPv6 prefixes. Absolute

      configurable for sending the Relay-Supplied Prefix option and the
      Absolute Precedence option. Relay agents SHOULD have separate
      configuration for each option to determine if it is to be added to
      DHCPv6 request. A relay agent will include these options in the option
      payload of a Request message. DHCPv6 relay agent should set
      Relay-Supplied Prefix option when it receives DHCPv6 request from a host
      with specific characteristics like authenticated using address based
      mechanism. Relative Precedence option is used when the relay agent is
      unaware of the external prefixes to be assigned to the host. DHCPv6
      relay agent should set Absolute Precedence when there is a need to
      change the precedence value for prefixes in scenario's discussed in
      <xref target="IPv6_multihoming"/> and/or disable IPv6 temporary
      addresses for the host. <list style="empty">
          <t>Discussion: To reduce end-user configuration of the DHCPv6 relay
          agent, the DHCPv6 relay agent can use the mechanism specified in
          <xref target="RFC3633"/> to automatically learn the IPv6 prefixes
          that will be delegated to DHCPv6 clients. DHCPv6 relay agent in
          future can use leasequery-like capability discussed in section 3.2
          of RFC <xref target="RFC5007"/> to learn the prefix information from
          DHCPv6 server.</t>

    <section anchor="dhcp_server_behaviour" title="DHCPv6 Server Behaviour">
      <t>Upon receiving a DHCPv6 request containing the Relay-Supplied Prefix
      Option or the Absolute Precedence Option, the DHCPv6 server processing
      is described below:</t>

      <section title="Relay-Supplied Prefix Option">
        <t>The Relay-Supplied Prefix Option contains flags that defines the
        characteristics of the host. <list style="numbers">
            <t>IPV6_DIS_TEMP_ADDR - This flag indicates that Temporary IPv6
            address allocation is to be disabled for the host. The DHCPv6
            server should ignore any IA_TA options in the DHCPv6 request.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Absolute Precedence Option">
        <t>Absolute Precedence Option - The DHCPv6 server should send a reply
        to the host with the prefixes received from DHCPv6 relay agent along
        with Precedence. If the option has "N" bit set to 1, the server SHOULD
        ignore the IA_TA options in the DHCPv6 request, effectively disabling
        the use of temporary addresses for that prefix. The DHCPv6 server will
        ignore the "N" bit for destination prefixes.</t>

        <t>Note : If DHCPv6 servers receives both options with conflicting
        flags IPV6_DIS_TEMP_ADDR and "N" bit then it SHOULD treat it as
        mis-configuration on the relay agent and discard these options.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Relay-Supplied Prefix and Absolute Precedence options are exchanged
      only between the DHCPv6 relay agent and DHCPv6 server, section 21.1 of
      <xref target="RFC3315"/> provides details on securing DHCPv6 messages
      sent between servers and relay agents. And, section 23 of <xref
      target="RFC3315"/> provides general DHCPv6 security considerations.</t>

      <t>It is possible for a DHCPv6 client to include the Relay-Supplied
      Prefix option or the Absolute Precedence option, which would be received
      by a DHCPv6 server. This would cause the DHCPv6 client to receive a
      different DHCPv6 response than it would have otherwise received.</t>

    <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to assign option codes to OPTION_RS_PREFIX and
      OPTION_ABSOLUTE_PRECEDENCE from the option-code space as defined in
      section "DHCPv6 Options" of <xref target="RFC3315"/>.</t>
