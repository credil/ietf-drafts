INTERNET DRAFT      <Post-Repair Non-RLE loss Count>  September 16, 2013


1  Introduction

   RTCP SR/RR [RFC3550] contains some rough statistics about the data
   received from the particular source indicated in that block. One of
   them is the cumulative number of packet lost, which is called pre-
   repair loss metric in this document. This metric conveys information
   regarding the total number of RTP data packets that have been lost
   since the beginning of the RTP session. However, this metric is
   measured on media stream before any loss repair mechanism, e.g.,
   retransmission [RFC4588] and Forward Error Correction (FEC)
   [RFC5109], is applied. Using a repair mechanism usually results in
   recovering some or all of the lost packets. Therefore, by observing
   the change in fraction lost and the cumulative loss, the sending
   endpoint cannot assess the performance of the repair mechanism.
   consequently, [RFC5725] specifies a post-repair loss RLE XR report
   block to address this issue. The sending endpoint is able to infer
   which packets were repaired from the RLE report block, but at the
   cost of higher overhead. When applications use multiple XR blocks,
   the endpoints require more concise reporting to save bandwidth.

   This document defines a new XR block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] and complement the report block defined in [RFC5725] for
   use in a range of RTP applications. This new block type reports the
   number of RTP packets on the primary source stream that are still
   lost after applying one or more loss repair mechanisms. When
   comparing this metric with pre-repair loss metric of RTCP SR/RR, it
   may bring ambiguity as noted in [RFC5725]: Some packets will not be
   repaired in current RTCP interval. So in [RFC5725] it is suggested to
   delay report block to wait for packets to be repaired. However, it is
   not wise to delay this report block arbitrarily until those packets
   have been fully repaired. Thus it is RECOMMENDED that this report
   block should be generated for those source packets that have no
   further chance of being repaired. But a potential ambiguity may
   result from sequence number range inconsistent. To address this
   issue, another metric, loss repaired count, is also introduced in
   this report block. So, the metrics in this report block are
   RECOMMENDED NOT to be compared with the pre-repair loss metric.  

   The metrics defined in this document belongs to the class of
   transport-related metrics defined in [RFC6792]. And it is in
   accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and [RFC6792]. These
   metrics are applicable to any RTP applications, especially those that
   use loss repair mechanisms.

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3  Post-Repair Loss Count Metrics Report Block

   This block describes the residual number of packets lost after
   applying repair mechanisms. The report block is complementary to the
   RTCP XR metrics defined in [RFC5725], because it uses a non-RLE
   format. Note that when the reporting of this block spans across more
   than one measurement interval [RFC6776], the metrics may contain the
   count of the packets in the current or previous measurement
   interval.

   The post-repair loss count metrics report block has the following
   format:

      0               1               2               3               4

      This field is in accordance with the definition in [RFC3611]. In
      this report block, it MUST be set to 4. The block MUST be
      discarded if the block length is set to a different value.

      sequence number of the first packet fully repaired that this block
      reports on.

   end_seq: 16 bits

      The sequence number of the last packet fully repaired that this
      block reports on plus one. 

   post-repair loss count: 32 bits

      Total number of packets finally lost after one or more loss-repair
      methods, e.g., FEC and/or retransmission, during this interval.
      Note that this metric must be measured in the primary source
      stream.

   loss repaired count: 32 bits

      Total number of packets fully repaired after one or more loss-
      repair methods, e.g., FEC and/or retransmission, during this
      interval. Note that this metric must be measured in the primary
      source stream.

INTERNET DRAFT      <Post-Repair Non-RLE loss Count>  September 16, 2013


4  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol) for
   signaling the use of RTCP XR blocks. However XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling (see section 5 of [RFC3611]).

4.1  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This session augments the SDP attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in Section
   5.1 of [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   xr-format =/ xr-prlr-block

   xr-prlr-block = "post-repair-loss-count"

4.2  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].

5  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this RTCP XR block introduces no new security
   considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611]. This block does
   not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to confidentially
   documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611] does not apply.

   An attacker may put incorrect information in the Post-Repair Loss
   Count reports, which will be affect the performance of loss repair
   mechanisms. Implementers should consider the guidance in [I-D.ietf-
   avtcore-srtp-not-mandatory] for using appropriate security
   mechanisms, i.e., where security is a concern, the implementation
   should apply encryption and authentication to the report block. For
   example, this can be achieved by using the AVPF profile together with
   the Secure RTP profile as defined in [RFC3711]; an appropriate
   combination of the two profiles (an "SAVPF") is specified in
   [RFC5124]. However, other mechanisms also exist (documented in [I-
   D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options]) and might be more suitable. 

6  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration. For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].
