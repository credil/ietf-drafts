 Protection Mechanisms for Label Distribution Protocol P2MP/MP2MP Label
                             Switched Paths
                draft-zhao-mpls-mldp-protections-02.txt

Abstract

   Service providers continue to deploy real-time multicast applications
   using Multicast LDP (mLDP) across MPLS networks.  There is a clear
   need to protect these real-time applications and to minimize
   switching times in the event of failure.

   This document outlines the requirements, procedures and extensions to
   facilitate mLDP Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-
   Multipoint (MP-to-MP) LSP protection within an MPLS network.

1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology discussed in [RFC5036] and [MT-LDP].
   Additionally the following section provides further explanation for
   key terms and terminology:

   o  PLR: The node where the traffic is logically redirected onto the
      preset backup path is called Point of Local Repair (PLR).

   o  N: The node being protected.

   o  Pn: The node(s) on the backup path for protecting node N.

   o  MP: The node where the backup path merges with the primary path is
      called Merge Point (MP).

   o  FD: The node that detects the failure on primary path, and then
      triggers the neccessary action for traffic protection is called
      Failure Detector (FD).  Either traffic sender or receiver can be
      the FD, depending on which protection mode has been deployed.
      Further specification is provided in later sections.

   o  SP: The node where the traffic is physically switched/duplicated
      onto the backup path is called Switchover Point (SP).  In
      multicast scenarios, PLR and SP can be two different nodes.
      Further specification is provided in later sections.

   o  T-LDP: Targeted LDP session.


2.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Introduction

   In order to meet user demands, operators and service providers
   continue to deploy multicast applications using Multicast LDP (mLDP)
   across MPLS networks.  In certain key scenarios, conventional IGP-
   mLDP convergence mechanisms fail to meet protection switching times
   required to minimise, or negate entirely, application interruptions
   for real-time applications, including stock trading, on-line games,
   and multimedia teleconferencing.

   Current best practice for protecting services, and subsequently

   higher-layer applications, include the pre-computation and
   establishment of a backup path.  Once a failure has been detected on
   the primary path, the traffic will be transmitted across the back-up
   path.

   However, two major challenges exist with the existing solution.  The
   first is how to build an absolutely disjointed backup path for each
   node in a multicast tree; the second is how to balance between
   convergence time, resource consumption and network efficiency.

   For a primary LDP P2MP/MP2MP LSP, there are several methods to set up
   a backup path, these include:

   o  The use of an RSVP-TE P2P tunnel as a logical out-going interface,
      consequently utilize the mature high availability technologies of
      RSVP-TE.

   o  The use of an LDP P2P LSP as a packet encapsulation, so that the
      complex configuration of P2P RSVP-TE can be skipped.

   o  Creating a P2MP/MP2MP backup LSP according to IGP's loop-free
      alternative route.  Comparing to using P2P LSPs, this solution can
      prevent unnecessary packet duplication on common links.

   o  Creation of Multiple Topology (MT) LSP using an entirely
      disjointed topology.

   When the backup path is present, there are two options for packet
   forwarding and protection switchover:

   o  Option 1
      The traffic sender transmits the stream on both the primary and
      backup path.  Once the local traffic receiver detects a failure
      the switchover will be relatively fast.  However the disadvantage
      of this method is that it consumes bandwidth as duplicate traffic
      will be sent on the protection and backup path.

   o  Option 2
      The traffic sender transmits only on the primary path.  Although
      bandwidth resource usage is minimized, cooperation is required to
      provide adequate switching times and minimise high-layer
      application impact.

   Ideally if switching time performance for Option 2 can be closer to
   the Option 1, it is reasonable to choose it to avoid bandwidth
   wastage.  The recommendations of this document are based on this
   point of view.

   This document provides several ways to setup the backup path for mLDP
   LSP, including P2P based mLDP node protection, P2MP based mLDP node
   protection, and MT based end-to-end protection.  The goal is to build
   a reliable umbrella to against traffic black hole.

   Note that the backup path computation is out of the scope of this
   draft, the algorithm can be either LFA or any other algorithms
   available including the offline tools.  Besides, how to detect
   failure is also outside the scope of this document, the mechanism can
   be bidirectional or unidirectional forwarding detection for link or
   target object.

3.1.  Requirements

   A number of requirements have been identified that allow the optimal
   set of mechanisms to developed.  These currently include:

   o  Computation of a disjointed (link and node) backup path within the
      multicast tree;

   o  Minimization of protection convergence time;

   o  Minimization of operation and maintenance cost;

   o  Optimization of bandwidth usage;

   o  Minimization the impact on the existing network deployment.

3.2.  Scope

   The method to detect failure is outside the scope of this document.
   Also this document does not provide any authorization mechanism for
   controlling the set of LSRs that may attempt to join a mLDP
   protection session.


4.  mLDP Node Protection using P2P LSPs

   By encapsulating mLDP packets within an P2P TE tunnel or P2P LDP
   backup LSP, the LDP P2MP/MP2MP LSP can be protected by the P2P
   protection mechanisms.  However, this protection mechanism is not
   capable of recovering the failure on the destination node of the P2P
   backup LSP.  Thus, this section provides an extra method to protect
   node using an P2P LSP.

             Figure 1: P2P Based mLDP Node Protection Example

   In Figure 1 (P2P Based mLDP Node Protection Example) above, the
   preferential path from R1 to R4/R5 is through R2, and the secondary
   path is through R3.  In this case, the mLDP LSP <X,Y>, will be
   established according to the IGP preferential path as R1-- R2--R4/R5.
   R4's backup P2P path is R1--R3--R5--R4.  R5's backup P2P path is R1--
   R3--R5.  (We assume that all the nodes in Figure 1 support the P2P
   Based mLDP Node Protection capability.)

   The procedure for P2P Based mLDP Node Protection is as follows:

      The MP(s) (in this example R4 or R5) sends label mapping message
      with protection information to the the protected node N(in this
      example R2).  Node N notifies all the dowstream information to the
      node PLR(in this example R1).  PLR seletes P2P LSP toward each
      MP(s) as backup path encapsulation.  When PLR detects N failed,
      PLR switches traffic to MP(s) over corresponding backup path(s).
      PLR will stop the backup traffic forwarding after relative MP(s)
      finish convergence procedure.

   There are two methods for PLR to switch over the traffic:

Internet-Draft              mLDP Protections                  March 2012


   o  Option 1:
      If PLR can differentiate the link and node failure, such as
      binding two BFD sessions on link and node, then it can feed the
      traffic to the node protection path only when the node failure is
      detected.  Only N is required to maintain BFD session with the
      PLR, it does not need to maintain the large number of BFD sessions
      with MPs.

   o  Option 2:
      If the PLR can not differentiate between link and node failure, it
      should feed the traffic to both link protection path and node
      protection path at the same time, and MP must take the
      responsibility to drop one stream.  In this case, N must maintain
      BFD sessions with PLR and all the MPs.

   [Editors Note - The authors recommend the first method to save BFD
   resource usage, the details are specified in section 4.1.2.  This
   Editors note and remaining options will be adjusted once we get more
   feedbacks from users.]

   Additionally there are two methods for the backup label cleanup
   between the MP and PLR:

   o  Option 1:
      The PLR can delete the backup label by receiving a withdraw
      notification message from MP through a T-LDP between PLR and MP.
      This method needs PLR maintains a huge number of T-LDP sessions
      with MPs.

   o  Option 2:
      The second method requires cooperation between PLR and MP by a
      synchronous timer.  The MP will synchronize the timers to the PLR
      and hold the backup label resource until its local timer expires.
      In addition the PLR will delete the backup label when its local
      timer expires.

   [Editors Note - The authors recommend the second method in order to
   save T-LDP resource usage, the details are specified in section
   4.1.3.  This Editors note and remaining options will be adjusted once
   we get more feedbacks from users.]

   The following in this section demonstrates the signaling and
   procedures for P2P Based Node Protection.  Note that STEP5 and STEP6
   should be acted at the same time.

   STEP1  MP's procedures for setting up backup path:
          Take R4 for example, which acts as a node MP.  R4 determines N
          (in this example R2) as its upstream LSR, and then sends label
          mapping message to R2 including label L4 for <X,Y>.  This
          label mapping message MUST include a new LDP MP Status Value
          Element, which includes a backup label and a reserve-time.
          The backup label L4' is assigned by MP for PLR's backup path.
          In order to avoid upgrading the MP's hardware to support
          filtrating traffic, this backup label can be same with L4.
          This reserve-time is the vlaue of the reserve-timer on MP,
          which can be configured, and it is recommend to be longer than
          the IGP convergence time and LDP MBB procedure time.

   STEP2  N's procedures for setting up backup path:
          When R2 receives the mapping message from MP, it determines R1
          as its upstream LSR and send a label mapping message with
          label L2 to R1.  Besides, R2 transfers all the new LDP MP
          Status Value Elements, received from its downstreams, to R1 by
          a notification message.

   STEP3  PLR's procedures for setting up backup path:
          When R1 receives this notification message and label mapping
          message from R2, R1 creates two forwarding paths: the primary
          forwarding state is <X,Y,L2> , and the secondary forwarding
          states is <X,Y,L4'>.  Note that there might be more than one
          secondary forwarding states, such as <X,Y,L5'>.

   STEP4  PLR's procedures when node N fails:
          Once the node PLR(R1) detects the node N(R2) failure, before
          protocol converging, R1 will switch the traffic to MP(R4) over
          P2P LSP, with inner label as L4', and outer label as the P2P
          backup LSP R1--R3-- R5--R4.  Note that the PLR MUST NOT switch
          traffic to backup path until it detects N failure.  R1 will
          also duplicate the traffic to other MPs(for example R5) over
          relative P2P LSPs.  Meanwhile, the node PLR will create a
          reserve-timer with the reserve-time value in the notification
          message for each N's MP respectively.  Note that once the
          primary forwarding state is removed, the secondary forwarding
          state MUST be deleted too.

   STEP5  MP's procedures after convergence:
          MP will also create the reserve-timer when it detects the

          forwarding state after a new path to root is created or MBB

          procedure finishes.  Note that MP MUST hold the old bakcup
          label resource (L4') until its local reserve-timer expires.

   STEP6  PLR's procedures after convergence:
          When R1's local reserve-timers expire, it will stop the
          traffic on the backup paths and remove the secondary
          forwarding states.

   Note that the mLDP Local Protection mechanism can be used in any part
   of the mLDP LSP other than the ingress and egress nodes.  In other
   words, R1 can be either Ingress or Transit node, R4/R5 can be either
   Transit or Egress node.

4.1.2.  PLR Switching Over Considerations

   PLR switching over method depends on its failure detection mode.  If
   PLR switches traffic when a link failure happens, MP may receive
   reduplicate traffic because the node N still feeds the traffic to MP.
   This is a problem if MP accepts these reduplicate traffic.  There are
   two optional methods to solve this problem.

4.1.2.1.  Single Feed Mode When Node Failure Detection is Supported

   In this method, the node PLR MUST be capable of differentiating link
   and node failure, and MP will not receive reduplicate traffic.  It
   does not need MP's cooperation in such case, and the new label
   assigned to PLR has no need to be different with the one assigned to
   N.

   MP also needs to send label mapping message with a new LDP MP Status
   Value Element to the node N. Especially, the MP Status TLV's Node
   Failure Required Flag need to be set as 'Y'.  The node N transfers
   this MP Status TLV to the node PLR by notification message.

   In such case, the node PLR MUST NOT switch the traffic to the backup
   path until it detects the node N failure.

4.1.2.2.  Duel Feed Mode When Node Failure Detection is Not Supported

   In this method, MP must support traffic filtering.  Thus, PLR doesn't
   need to differentiate link and node failure becuase it can cooperate
   with the node MP.  The node MP may receive reduplicate traffic and
   MUST drop the backup traffic when the node N doesn't fail.  To
   support this manner, MP MUST assign PLR a new label Lp, which is
   different from the label Ln assigned for N.

   The node MP send label mapping message with a new LDP MP Status Value
   Element to the node N. The label Ln is encoded in the label TLV and



Zhao, et al.           Expires September 14, 2012              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              mLDP Protections                  March 2012


   the Backup Label Lp is encoded in the MP Status TLV.  Besides, the MP
   Status TLV's Node Failure Required Flag need be set as 'N'.  The node
   N transfers this MP Status TLV to the node PLR by notification
   message.

   If the MP Status TLV's Node Failure Required Flag is 'N', before
   failure occurres, the label Ln is activated and Lp is deactived on
   the node MP.  The PLR will switch traffic to the backup path when it
   detects the failure, no matter whether it is link failure or node
   failure.

   The node of MP needs to detect whether the node N is failure or not.
   This is why N needs to maintain BFD sessions with all the MP nodes.
   If N fails, MP should deactivate the primary forwarding state of
   label Ln, and active the secondary forwarding state of label Lp.  So
   the MP will receive the traffic on the backup path, and drop the
   traffic on the primary path.  Otherwise, if it is link failure, MP
   will keep the backup label Lp deactivate and the traffic PLR
   switching to the backup path is dropped by MP.

4.1.3.  Backup Path Cleanup Considerations

   In order to prevent traffic duplication and unnecessary traffic lost,
   PLR and MP should delete the label at the same thime.  There are two
   methods to ensure this.

4.1.3.1.  Timer Synchronization Mode

   In this mode, a reserve-timer is needed on both MP and PLR.  The
   value of this timer can be configured on MP, and it is recommend to
   be longer than the IGP convergence time and mLDP MBB procedure time.

   Once the reserve time is configured, the new LDP MP Status Value
   Element in label mapping message MUST include this time value and the
   Delete Flag MUST be set as 'implicit-delete', mentioned in Section
   4.4.

   The Node N transfers this time value and flag to the node PLR by the
   notification message.  When the node PLR receives this notification
   message, PLR checks the Delete Flag and uses this time value as PLR's
   reserve timer if Delete Flag equals 'implicit-delete'.

   PLR will create the reserve-timer when it detects the failure and
   switch traffic to the backup path.  PLR will remove the secondary
   forwarding state when this reserve-timer expire.

   MP will create the reserve-timer when it detects the network
   convergence.  MP will remove the old forwarding state after a new

   path to root is created or MBB procedure finishes.  Noted that, MP
   MUST hold the old label resource not return it to the free pool until
   its reserve-timer timeout.

4.1.3.2.  T-LDP Mode

   In this mode, an automatic setting up T-LDP is needed between MP and
   PLR.  It requires the node MP and PLR MUST be capable of setting up
   T-LDP as documented in [RFC5036].

   If MP need a T-LDP, the new LDP MP Status Value Element TLV in label
   mapping message MUST set its Delete Flag as 'explicit-delete'.

   The Node N transfers this flag to the node PLR by the notification
   message.  When the node PLR receives this notification message, PLR
   checks the Delete Flag and trigger a T-LDP toward to MP if flag
   equals 'explicit-delete'.

   MP will remove the old forwarding state after a new path to root is
   created or MBB procedure is end.  Meanwhile, MP MUST send a
   notification message to PLR through T-LDP.  This message include a
   new LDP MP Status Value Element TLV, whose status code is 'withdraw'
   defined.

   PLR will not remove the secondary forwarding state until it receive
   the notification message with 'withdraw' status code.

   Noted that if the primary forwarding state is removed, the secondary
   forwarding state need be deleted no matter which delete method is
   used.

4.2.  Protocol Extensions for P2P Based Node Protection

4.2.1.  P2P Based MP Protection Capability Parameter TLV

   A new Capability Parameter TLV is defined as P2P Based MP Protection
   Capability.  Following is the format of this new Capability Parameter
   TLV:

   This is an unidirectional capability announced.

   An LSR, which supports the P2P based protection procedures, should
   advertise this P2P Based MP Protection Capability TLV to its LDP
   speakers.

   An LSR can consider that has no P2P Based MP Protection Capability if
   it dose not announce its capability.  An LSR MUST NOT send any
   message including the new LDP MP Status Value Element TLV to its
   peer, which dose not have the P2P Based MP Protection Capability.

   Capability Data might be needed to distinguish the capabilities of
   different nodes, such as PLR, MP, N, Pn and so on.  This part is TBD.

4.2.2.  P2P Based MP Node Protection Status Element

   A new type of LDP MP Status Value Element is introduced, for
   notifying downstream LSR information, including respective labels and
   other parameters.  It is encoded as follows:

5.  mLDP Node Protection using P2MP LSPs

   By using IGP-FRR, LDP can build the backup mLDP LSP among PLR, the
   protected node, and MPs (the downstream nodes of the protected node).
   In the cases where the amount of downstream nodes are huge, this
   mechanism can avoid unnecessary packet duplication on PLR, so that
   protect the network from traffic congestion risk.

          Figure 2: mLDP Local Protection using P2MP LSP Example

   In Figure 2 (P2MP Based mLDP Local Protection Example), the
   preferential path from R1 to R4/R5 is through R2, and the secondary
   path is through R3.  In this case, the mLDP LSP will be established
   according to the IGP preferential path as R1--R2--R4/R5.  This
   section will take the Protected Node as R2 for example, actually the
   Protected Node can be any Transit node of the mLDP LSP.  (We assume
   that all the nodes in Figure 2 surpport this P2MP based node
   protection method, including Pn.)

   The procedure for P2P Based mLDP Node Protection is as follows:

      As the Protected Node, R2 will announce its selected upstream node
      R1 to all its downstream nodes, which are R4 and R5 in this
      example, when it receives thses label mapping messages.

      R4 and R5 can consider R1 as the root node of the backup mLDP LSP,
      and trigger the backup LSP signaling.  In parallel, R4/R5 will
      bind the primary NHLFE(s) to both the backup and primary ILM
      entry, so that the traffic receiving from backup mLDP LSP can be

Internet-Draft              mLDP Protections                  March 2012


      merged locally to the primary LSP.

      The primary LSP and backup LSP are differentiated by the signaling
      procedure, so normally PLR can only feed traffic on the primary
      path.  When R2 node fails, R1 will switch the traffic to the
      preset backup path quickly.

   In this scenario, if R2 is protected by two P2P LSPs as R1--R3--R4
   and R1--R3--R5, the traffic will be duplicated on R1, and R3 will
   receive two streams.  If R2 is protected by mLDP LSP instead, R3 will
   only receive one stream, and the packet duplication will be done on
   R3.

5.1.  Signaling Procedures for P2MP Based Node Protection

5.1.1.  P2MP Based Node Protection Procedure Example

   [Editors Note - This section introduces the procedures for P2MP Based
   Node Protection based on the PLR being capable for node detection.]

   We assume all the involved nodes have advertised their corresponding
   capabilities.  And the following in this section demonstrates the
   signaling and procedures for P2MP Based Node Protection.

   STEP1  N's procedures for setting up backup path:
          MP determins N as its upstream and sends label mapping for to
          N, following the procedures as documented in [RFC6388] without
          any extention.  When the Protected Node (R2) receives these
          label mapping messages and determines its upstream LSR (R1),
          it will notify to all its downstream nodes immediately.  If
          there are other LSR(s) becoming its downstream node(s) later,
          it will do the announcement for the new downstream node(s).

   STEP2  MP's procedures for setting up backup path:
          When the Merge Point (R4/R5) receive the notification, they
          individually determine the primary and secondary paths toward
          R1 according to the IGP-FRR results.  Then they will send out
          label mapping messages including an LDP MP Status TLV that
          carries a FRR Status Code to indicate the primary path and
          secondary path.  The backup path is uniquely identified by
          root address, opaque value, PLR Node address, and Protected
          Node address.  Noted that, the label assigned for primary parh
          and secondary path MUST be different to avoid the MP feeding
          the primary traffic to its secondary path's downstream LSRs.

Internet-Draft              mLDP Protections                  March 2012


   STEP3  Pn's procedures for setting up backup path:
          When the transit nodes of the secondary LSP receive the FRR
          label mapping message, they can easily consider it as a new
          mLDP LSP establishment, and follow the existing protocol
          procedures.  The modification for these nodes is dealing with
          the FRR FEC, which is identified by root address, opaque
          value, PLR address, and Protected Node address.
          To avoid the backup LSP going through the Protected Node,
          additional path selection rule(s) can be applied.  A simple
          method is that the transit nodes can not choose the specified
          Protected Node as its upstream LSR on the secondary LSP.
          Other methods, such as not-via policy, are under study, and
          will be added in the future.

   STEP4  PLR's procedures for setting up backup path:
          When the Point of Local Repair (R1) receives the FRR label
          mapping message, it will generate the backup forwarding entry
          for the specific LSP, which is identified by the root address
          and opaque value in the message, and bind the backup
          forwarding state to the specific primary entry, which is
          indicated by the Protected Node address in the message.  Note
          that there might be more than one backup forwarding entries
          for a specific protected node.

   STEP5  PLR's procedures when node N fails:
          When failure is detected by PLR, it will switch the traffic to
          the secondary path.  MP will also locally merge the traffic
          back to the primary LSP.  The switchover manner on PLR is
          specified in the later section.

   STEP6  Procedures after network re-converges:
          When Merge Point(s) see the next hop to Root changed, it/they
          will advertise the new mapping, and the traffic will re-
          converge to the new primary path.  MP then withdraw the backup
          label after finishing their re-converge.  Pn will delete the
          specified backup LSP like as the process of normally P2MP LSP.
          And the entire backup P2MP LSP will be deleted when all the
          node MP leave the backup P2MP LSP.

5.1.2.  PLR Switching Over Considerations

   The P2MP Based Node Protection also has the BFD scalability issue on
   the Protected node.  Similar with P2P Based Node Protection solution,
   this section provides two methods for deployment.

   o  Option 1:
      If PLR can not differentiate link and node failure, MP must take
      the responsibility to drop one of the two reduplicate traffic when



Zhao, et al.           Expires September 14, 2012              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft              mLDP Protections                  March 2012


      failure is detected.  In this case, the Node Failure Required
      Flag, in the P2MP Based MP Node Protection Status Element, must be
      set as 'N'.  PLR will switch the traffic to the backup path when
      failure detected and MP will drop traffic on the backup path until
      it sees N fails.

   o  Option 2:
      If PLR can differentiate link and node failure, PLR MUST NOT
      switch the traffic to the backup path until it detects the node N
      failure.  In this case, the Node Failure Required Flag, in the
      P2MP Based MP Node Protection Status Element, must be set as 'Y'.

   Note that, all the MPs of N MUST use one same Node Failure Required
   Flag value.  Otherwise, the backup P2MP LSP tree need depart to two
   trees different from the switch over type, and this part is TBD.  And
   it is also possible that can use a backup MP2MP LSP tree to protect
   one node in the primary MP2MP LSP tree, this part is TBD too

5.2.  Protocol Extensions for P2MP Based Node Protection

5.2.1.  P2MP Based MP Protection Capability Parameter TLV

   A new Capability Parameter TLV is defined as P2MP Based MP Protection
   Capability for node protection.  Following is the format of this new
   Capability Parameter TLV:

       0                   1                   2                   3

       |S| Reserved    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       S: As specified in [RFC5561]


   This is an unidirectional capability announced.

   An LSR, which supports the P2MP based protection procedures, should
   advertise this P2MP Based MP Protection Capability TLV to its LDP
   speakers.  Without receiving this capability annoucement, an LSR MUST
   NOT send any message including the P2MP Based MP Node Protection
   Status Element to its peer.

   Capability Data might be needed to distinguish the capabilities of
   different nodes, such as PLR, MP, N, Pn and so on.  This part is TBD.

5.2.2.  P2MP Based MP Node Protection Status Elements

   A new type of LDP MP Status Value Element is introduced, for
   notifying upstream LSR infomation.  It is encoded as follows:

6.  mLDP End-to-End Protection using LDP/mLDP Multiple Topology

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology] also provides the mechanism to
   setup disjointed LSPs within different topologies.  So that
   applications can use these redundant LSPs for end-to-end protection.

           mLDP End-to-end Protection with Shared Upstream Node

                                 Figure 4

   In Figure 4 (mLDP End-to-end Protection with Shared Upstream Node
   Example), there are two separated topologies from Root node to Leaf 1
   and Leaf 2 except the link between R1 and Root node.  For the same
   root address and opaque value, the Leaf node can trigger mLDP LSPs in
   each topology.  Root node can setup 1:1 or 1+1 end-to-end protection,
   using these two mLDP LSPs.  The difference in this example comparing
   to the last example where the primary and backup topology are totally
   disjoint, if there is a link failure between the Root and R1 or node
   R1 fails, there is no protection available.

6.1.  Signaling Procedures for MT Based End-to-end Protection

   Using the protocol extensions and signaling procedure provided by
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology], Leaf 1 and Leaf 2 in figure 8 or
   figure 9 are able to trigger mLDP LSPs in different topologies,
   sending label mapping messages with same root address, same opaque
   value, different MT-ID and different label.  Based on the two new
   Address Families named "MT IP" and "MT IPv6" introduced in [I-D.ietf-
   mpls-ldp-multi-topology] that can be used to specify IP prefixes
   within a topology scope, the mLDP FEC elements for leaf1 and leaf2
   will be encoded as follows:

   When the Root node receives the label mapping messages from different
   topologies, it will set up two mLDP LSPs for application as end-to-
   end protection.  Failure detection for the primary mLDP LSP is
   outside the scope of this document.  Either Root node or Leaf node
   can be the Failure Detector.
