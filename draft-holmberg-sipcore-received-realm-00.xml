				<t>
					When SIP sessions are established between networks belonging to different
					operators, or between interconnected networks belonging to the same operator
					(or enterprise), the SIP requests might traverse transit network.
				</t>
				<t>
					Such transit networks might provide different kind of services. In order
					to do that, a transit network often needs to know to which operator 
					(or enterprise) the adjacent upstream network, from which the SIP session
					initiation request is received, belongs.
				</t>
				<t>
					This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
					Via header field parameter, "received-realm", which allows a SIP entity acting
					as an entry point to a transit network to indicate from which adjacent upstream
					network a SIP request is received, using a network realm value associated
					with the adjacent network.
				</t>
				<t>
					NOTE: As the adjacent network can be an enterprise network, an Inter Operator 
					Identifier (IOI) cannot be used to identity the network, as IOIs are not 
					defined for enterprise networks.
				</t>
				<t>
					The following sections describe use-case where the information is needed.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Use-Case: Transit Network Application Services" toc="default">
				<t>
					The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TS 23.228 <xref target="3GPP.23.228" 
					pageno="false" format="default" /> specifies how an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) 
					network can be used to provide transit funtionality. An operator can use its IMS
					network to provide transit functionality e.g. to non-IMS customers, to enterprise
					networks, and to other network operators.
				</t>
				<t>
					The transit network operator can provide application services to the networks
					for which it is providing transit functionality. Transit application services are 
					typically not provided per user basis, as the transit network does not have access 
					to the user profiles of the networks for which the application services are provided. 
					Instead, the application services are provided per served network. 
				</t>
				<t>				
					When a SIP entity that provides application services (e.g. an Application Server) 
					within a transit network receives a SIP request, in order to apply the correct 
					services it needs to know the adjacent upstream network from which the SIP request 
					is received.					
				</t>			
			</section>
			<section title="Use-Case: Transit Network Routing" toc="default">
				<t>
					A transit network operator normally interconnects to many diferent
   					operators, including other transit network operators, and provides
   					transit routing of SIP requests received from one operator network
   					towards the destination. The destination can be within an operator network
   					to which the transit network operator has a direct interconnect, or 
					within an operator network that only can be reached via one or more 
   					interconnected transit operators. 
				</t>
				<t>				
   					For each customer, i.e. interconnected network operator for which, 
   					the transit network operator routes SIP requests towards the
   					requested destination a set of transit routing polices are defined.
   					These policies are used to determine how a SIP request shall be routed 
   					towards the requested destination to meet the agreement the transit
   					network operator has with its customer.
				</t>
				<t>				 
   					When a SIP entity that performs the transit routing functionality
   					receives a SIP request, in order to apply the correct set of transit
   					routing policies, it needs to know from which of its 
   					customers, i.e. adjacent upstream network, the SIP request is 
   					received.
				</t>

		<section title="Applicability" toc="default">
			<t>
				The mechanism defined in this specification MUST only be used by SIP entities that
				are able to verify from which adjacent upstream network a SIP request is received.
			</t>
			<t>
				The mechanism for verifying from which adjacent upstream network a SIP request is
				received is outside the scope of this specification.

				The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
				"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
				BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119" pageno="false" format="default" />.

				<t>
					This section describes how a SIP entity, acting as an entry point to
					a network, uses the "received-realm" Via header field parameter.
				</t>
			</section>			

			<section title="Behavior of a SIP entity acting as a network entry point" anchor="sec-sipent-recv" toc="default">
				<t>
					When a SIP entity, acting as a network entry point, forwards a SIP request, or initiates a SIP request
					on its own (e.g. a PSTN gateway), the SIP entity adds a Via header field to the SIP request, according
					to the procedures in RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" />. In addition, if 
					the SIP entity is able to assert the adjacent upstream network, and if the SIP entity is aware of a network 
					realm value defined for that network, the SIP entity can add a "received-realm" Via header field parameter,
					conveying the network realm value, to the Via header field added to the SIP request.
