            IPv6 Address Prefixes Reserved for Documentation
                   draft-moreiras-v6ops-rfc3849bis-00

Abstract

   [RFC3849] specified an IPv6 prefix to be used in documentation, in
   order to reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when
   relating examples of deployed systems.  This prefix was reserved to
   be used in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.  It
   became widely accepted and used.

   Although the IPv6 documentation prefix proved to be very useful, a /
   32 prefix is not enough to be used to document some kinds of IPv6
   deployments, such as large ISP deployments, transition techniques,
   and other useful examples that require longer prefixes.  This
   document requests the allocation of a new global unicast /20 block,
   as a documentation prefix, and expands the range of uses that can be
   expected for these prefixes.  It also updates [RFC3849].

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the IPv6 address blocks provided to be used
   in documentation.  These blocks SHOULD be used to describe network
   topologies, transition techniques or other systems, in RFCs, books,
   videos, and documentation in general.  They also MAY be used in
   didactic laboratories, which aim to teach IPv6 or network principles.

   The first block was reserved in [RFC3849], from the address space of
   the Asia Pacific (APNIC) regional addressing community.  Other
   documentation ranges have been defined in the IETF, such as example
   domain names described in [RFC2606], and IPv4 documentation-only
   address blocks described in [RFC5737].  The IPv4 ranges reserved in
   [RFC1918] for private use are also used in documentation, as well as
   the Autonomous System numbers reserved in [RFC6996].

   Although the address block defined in [RFC3849] was within the range
   of a conventional allocation size for an Internet Service Provider,
   and it was expected that it could accurately match deployment
   scenarios, there are some situations that can't be represented
   accordingly with a prefix of 32 bits, such as: transition techniques,
   peering between multiple ISPs, IPv6 address plan for multi-regional
   ISPs, and others.

   This situation leads to the same problem that [RFC3849] tried to
   address.  Some documentation material, particularly some didactic
   material and laboratories, today is using IPv6 prefixes drawn from
   address blocks already allocated or assigned.  A similar situation
   with IPv4 addresses caused problems in production environments,
   because of address and routing conflicts with other services.

   This document reserves an additional larger IPv6 block for
   documentation, avoiding such problems.  It does not obsolete the
   current IPv6 documentation block 2001:0db8::/32, since it is widely
   deployed.  Nonetheless, it updates the current practice and specifies
   one larger IPv6 block, for the same use.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  IPv6 Documentation Prefixes

   The blocks provided for use in documentation are: 2001:0db8::/32 (v6
   -TEST-NET-1), and DDDD:D000::/20 [Note to RFC Editor: this address
   range is to be added before publication] (v6-TEST-NET-2).

4.  Operational Implications

   Addresses within the v6-TEST-NET-1, and v6-TEST-NET-2, SHOULD NOT
   appear on the public Internet and are used without any coordination
   with IANA or an Internet Regional Registry (RIR).  Network operators
   SHOULD add these address blocks to the list of non-routeable address
   spaces, and if packet filters are deployed, then this address block
   SHOULD be added to packet filters.

   These blocks are not for local use, and the filters may be used in
   both local and public contexts.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no new security considerations pertaining to this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA recorded the allocation of the IPv6 global unicast address
   prefix v6-TEST-NET-1 as a documentation-only prefix in the IPv6
   address registry.

   IANA is asked to record the allocation of v6-TEST-NET-2 prefix,
   within the range reserved for Global IPv6 addresses, for use as an
   additional documentation-only prefix, in the IPv6 address registry.

   No end party is to be assigned any of these address blocks.
