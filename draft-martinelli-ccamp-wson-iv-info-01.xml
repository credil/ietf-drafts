	This document defines the Information Model to  support Impairment-Aware (IA) Routing an Wavelength
	Assignment (RWA) function. This operation might be required in 
	Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) that already support RWA and the Information model defined 
	here goes in addition and it is fully compatible with the already defined information model for WSON.
      </t>
      <t>
	This information model shall support all control plane architectural options defined for WSON with 
	impairment validation. 
      </t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	In the context of Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON), <xref target="RFC6163"/> defines the 
	basic framework for a GMPLS control plane. The associated info model
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-info"/> defines all parameters
	required for the related RWA process. These references are the foundation but they do not consider
	the Optical Impairment case.
      </t>
      <t>
	In case of WSON where optical impairments plays a significant role, the framework document 
	<xref target="RFC6566"/> defines related control plane architectural options for an Impairment Aware
	routing and wavelength assignment (IA-RWA). Options include different combinations of Impairment Validation
	(IV) and RWA functions through control plane elements and operations (PCE, Routing, Signaling).
      </t>
      <t>
	This document provides the information model
	for the impairment aware case to allow the impairment validation function implemented in the 
	control plane or enabled by control plane available information. 
	This model goes in addition to <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-info"/> and  
	it is independent from any architectural option described by the framework <xref target="RFC6566"/>: 
	it shall support all of them.
      </t>
      <t>
	Computational Models for the optical impairments are defined by ITU standard body. 
	The currently available computation models 
	are reported in  <xref target="ITU.G680"/> and only cover only the linear impairment case.
	This perfectly fit with 
	scenario C defined in <xref target="RFC6566"/> section 4.1.1 and is considered in
	scope with WSON activity.
	The non-linear case is left for further study since currently no
	ITU computational models are available for 
	an accurate optical impairment estimation.
      </t>
      <t>
	The information model defined here provides a generic enough mechanism that could be easily
	extended to
	additional impairments models.

    <section title="Properties of an Impairment Information Model">

      <t>
	An information model may have several attributes or properties that
	need to be defined for each optical parameter made available to the
	control plane. The properties will help to determine how the control
	plane can deal with it depending on architectural options chosen
	within the overall impairment framework <xref target="RFC6566"/>. In some case
	properties value will help to identify the level of approximation
	supported by the IV process.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>
	    Time Dependency.<vspace blankLines="0" /> 
	    This will identify how the impairment may vary
	    with time. There could be cases where there is no time dependency,
	    while in other cases there may be need of  impairment re-
	    evaluation after a certain time.  In this category,  variations in impairments due to
	    environmental factors such as those discussed in [G.sup47] are
	    considered.
	    In some cases a level of
	    approximation will consider an impairment that has time dependency
	    as constant. In this Information Model we do neglect this property.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Wavelength Dependency. <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    This property will identify if an
	    impairment value can be considered as constant over all the
	    wavelength spectrum of interest or if it has different values.
	    Also in this case a detailed impairment evaluation might lead to
	    consider the exact value while an approximation IV might take a
	    constant value for all wavelengths.
	    In this Information Model we consider both case: dependency / not dependency
	    from a specific wavelengths. This property may appear directly in the 
	    Information model definitions or in the related encoding.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	    Linearity.
	    <vspace blankLines="0" /> 
	    As impairments are representation of physical effects
	    there are some that have a linear behavior while other are 
	    non-linear. Linear approximation is in scope of  scenario C
	    of <xref target="RFC6566"/>. 
	    During the impairment validation process, this property implies that the optical effect (or quantity)
	    satisfy the superposition principle, thus a final result can be calculated by the sum of each
	    component. The linearity implies the
	    additivity of optical quantities considered during an Impairment Validation process.
	    <vspace blankLines="0" /> 
	    The non-linear effects in general does not satisfy this property. The information model presented in this
	    document however, easily allow introduction of non-linear optical effects with a linear approximated contribution 
	    to the linear ones.	 
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	    Multi-Channel.<vspace blankLines="0" />
	    There are cases where a channel's impairments take
	    different values depending on the aside wavelengths already in
	    place. In this case a dependency among different LSP is
	    introduced and is typically a result of linear effects. 
	    This Information Model neglect this effects
	    on neighbor LSPs.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	The following table summarize the above considerations where in the first column reports
	the list of properties to be considered for each optical parameters, while  second column
	state if this property
	is taken into account or not by this Information Model.

    <section title="Background from WSON Information Model">
      <t>
	In this section we report terms already defined for the WSON-RWA (not impairment aware) 
	as in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-info"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode"/>. 
	The purpose is to provide essential information
	that will be reused or extended for the impairment case.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	In particular <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-info"/> defines the connectivity matrix as the follow:
      </t>
      <figure align='left'>
	<artwork align="left">
	  <![CDATA[
ConnectivityMatrix ::= <MatrixID> <ConnType> <Matrix>
	  ]]>
	</artwork>
      </figure>
          
      <t>
	However according to <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode"/> this definitions is further detailed
	as:
      </t>
      <figure align='left'>
	<artwork align="left">
	  <![CDATA[
ConnectivityMatrix ::= 
      <MatrixID> <ConnType> ((<LinkSet> <LinkSet>) ...)
	  ]]>
	</artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
	This second formula highlights how the connectivity matrix is built by pairs of LinkSet
	objects identifying the
	internal node connectivity capability due to internal optical node constrain. 
	It's essentially a binary information
	and tell us if a wavelengths or a set of wavelengths can go from an input port 
	to an output port.
      </t>
      <t>
	As a additional note, Connectivity Matrix belong to Node Information and is purely static.
	Dynamic information related
	to the actual usage of the connections are available through specific extension to link 
	information.
      </t>



    </section> <!-- END OF "Background from WSON Information Model" -->


    <section title="Optical Impairment Information Model">
      <t>
	The idea behind this Information Model is to reuse the concept of the Connectivity Matrix and defines an
	Impairment Matrix that summarize optical impairments provided by the Node and Links (i.e. fibers). 
      </t>
      <t>
	The goal of this document is not to rephrase content from  <xref target="ITU.G680"/> but only 
	provide necessary building blocks that allow the IW-RWA process to apply the computational model
	defined by such recommendation. <xref target="ITU.G680"/> computational models defined in section 9 
	provide information
	to calculate the following optical parameters:
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>OSNR. Section 9.1</t>
	  <t>Chromatic Dispersion (CD). Section 9.2</t>
	  <t>Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD). Section 9.3</t>
	  <t>Polarization Dependent Loss (PDL). Section 9.3 </t>
	</list>
	The recommendation <xref target="ITU.G680"/> call its computational model "transfer function" and details 
	formulas for a set of different optical equipments. For the purpose of this information model, only the set of 
	parameter is important.
      </t>
<!--
      <t>
	Another recomandation useful to for this Information model is the <xref target="ITU.G697"/>  defines 
	an encoding for all above parameters.  and in
	<xref target="encoding_considerations"/> we report some encoding consideration. The <xref target="ITU.G697"/> is 
	mainly oriented for monitoring so the purpose is only reuse parameter definitions for those parameters required 
	by Impairment Validation process.
      </t>
-->
      <t>
	This Information Model makes the assumption that the each Optical Node in the network is able to provide it's 
	own contribution  to above parameters. 
	To this extent the Information Model intentionally ignore all internal detailed parameters 
	that are used to by the formulas (i.e. "transfer function") but simply provide the object to carry results of
	the formulas. However no assumption is made on how the Optical node get the result of 
	parameter contribution (e.g. computed, provisioned, known by design, etc.).
      </t>
      <t>
	As an additional note, as reported in in <xref target="ITU.G680"/> Section 10, 
	each parameter can be reported as an OSNR contribution, in such way the Optical Node not necessarily embed 
	optical computational capability but can provide an approximated contribution to optical impairments.
      </t>
      <t>
	With the above considerations this Information Model provides an abstract view for an optical node and link
	to enable WSON protocol extension with optical impairments validation.  
      </t>
 
      <section title="Node Information">
	<t>
	  This model defines the Impairment Matrix as the following:

	    <t>
	      ConnType. This number identifies the type of matrix and it shall be unique in scope with

	  <![CDATA[
<ImpairmentVector> ::= [<LinkSet>] <OPTICAL_PARAM> ...
	  ]]>
	</artwork>
      </figure>
	<t>
	  The optional LinkSet object enable wavelength dependency property as per
	  <xref target="table_optical_properties"/>.  
	</t>
	<t>
	  OPTICAL_PARAM is an object representing an optical parameter.  The Impairment
	  vector contain a set of parameters as identified by <xref target="ITU.G697"/> 
	  since those parameters match the terms of the linear impairments 
	  computational models provided by <xref target="ITU.G680"/>. 
	  This information model does not speculate about set of parameters 
	  (since defined elsewhere, e.g. ITU-T),
	  however it does not preclude 
	  extentions by adding new parameters.

	   The Connectivity Matrix from <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-general-constraint-encode"/>

	   In this model a third dimension is added by generalizing the bnary information through 
	   the ImpairmentVector 
	   associated with each LinkSet pair.

	Details about encoding will be defined in a separate document 
	<xref target="I-D.martinelli-ccamp-wson-iv-encode"/> however worth remembering that, 
	within <xref target="ITU.G697"/> Appending V,
	ITU already provides a guideline for encoding some optical parameters. 
      </t>
      <t>
	In particular <xref target="ITU.G697"/> indicates that each parameters shall be represented by 
	a 32 bit floating point number.
      </t>
      <t>
	As an additional consideration, actual values for parameters defined in the information models 
	are provided by the Optical Node and it could provide by direct measurement or from some 
	internal computation starting from indirect measurement. In any case the encoding
	shall provide an the possibility to associate a variance with the parameter. 
	This information will enable the function implementing IV-RWA process to make some
	additional considerations on wavelength feasibility. <xref target="RFC6566"/> 
	Section 4.1.3 reports 
	some considerations regarding this degree of confidence during the impairment validation

      <t>
	The first assumption is that the RWA-WSON extentions are available and operationals. 
	To such extent, the RWA-WSON will provide the following information through it's

	<list style="symbols">
	  <t> The wavelenght connectivity (considering also the connectivity constrains 
	  by limited reconfigurable optics).

	    The interface compatibility at the physical level.

    <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                      v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
