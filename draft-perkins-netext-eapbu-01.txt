             Optimizing IP Mobility Authentication with EAP
                   draft-perkins-netext-eapbu-01.txt

Abstract

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is commonly used for
   access authentication in many wireless networks.  EAP methods often
   involve AAA servers to effect the required authentications;
   notifications about success or failure are then relayed back to a
   functional module in the access network known as the Network Access
   Server.  The Binding Authentication Data option has been defined for
   enabling alternative methods for authentication in the context of
   Mobile IPv6, and there is a subtype allocated for AAA-based
   authentication methods such as EAP.  However, some EAP methods
   require additional handling that requires specification not yet
   available in the existing documentation for the Binding
   Authentication Data option.  This document provides the required
   specification for at least some very widely deployed EAP methods.  In
   many situations requiring the use of EAP, this enables much faster
   operation for Mobile IPv6 tunnel redirection to a wireless device's
   new care-of address by avoiding having to do multiple
   authentications.

Internet-Draft   Optimizing MIP/PMIP EAP Authentication         Oct 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] is commonly
   used for access authentication in many wireless networks.  EAP
   methods often involve AAA servers to effect the required
   authentications; notifications are then relayed back to a functional
   module in the access network known as the Network Access Server.  For
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275], the Binding Authentication Data option
   [RFC4285] has been defined for enabling alternative methods for
   authentication, and a subtype has been allocated for AAA-based
   authentication methods such as EAP.  However, some EAP methods
   require additional handling that requires specification not yet
   available in the existing documentation for the Binding
   Authentication Data option.  This document provides the required
   specification for at least some very widely deployed EAP methods.  In
   many situations requiring the use of EAP, this enables much faster
   operation for Mobile IPv6 tunnel redirection to a wireless device's
   new care-of address.

2.  Problem Statement

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] requires the mobile node (MN) to authenticate
   with its assigned home agent.  Establishing an IPsec SA is
   accomplished after the MN has been authenticated.  EAP methods may be
   used within IKEv2 to authenticate the MN and then establish the MN's
   IPsec security association (SA).  The authentication and
   establishment of the IPsec SA is required in addition to access
   network authentication.  Most networks require a user/device to
   authenticate prior to be being connected to the network.  This
   results in the MN having to perform two authentications.  The MN has
   to first perform access authentication and then authenticate again
   for a second time with the home agent to establish the IPsec SA.
   This causes significant delay in the MN being registered with the HA.
   It should be noted that when the MN moves to a different access
   network, access network authentication is typically performed.
   However, when the IPsec SA already exists, that SA only needs to be
   updated with the changed end-point.  This can be achieved by setting
   the 'K' bit in the binding update sent from the new care-of-address.

   In the case of network based mobility, i.e Proxy Mobile IPv6
   [RFC5213] the Mobility Access Gateway (MAG) performs registration
   with the Local Mobility Agent (LMA) following access authentication.
   The MAG receives confirmation from a AAA server if the MN is
   authorized for mobility service and only after that does it send the
   proxy binding update to the LMA.

   Combining access authentication with mobility authentication results
   in an optimization and faster connectivity.  How to optimize or

   combine the access authentication with the authentication required
   for obtaining mobility service is the problem dealt with in this
   document.

3.  Proposed Solution

   The proposal contained in this I-D is to combine access
   authentication with Mobile IPv6 authentication.  As a result it saves
   at least one authentication sequence and hence speeds up the process
   of sending and receiving packets via the home agent or LMA.

   EAP is commonly used for access authentication.  Many of the EAP
   authentication methods interact with a AAA server which contain the
   credentials of the user.  The NAS element in an access network is
   essentially a AAA relay entity.  The proposal contained in this
   document aims to utilize the information available to the NAS from
   the access authentication phase to perform Mobile IP authentication
   as well.  The extensions needed to EAP and the Mobile IP signaling
   are described in the following sections.

   The basic idea is to route the access authentication signaling
   messages via the HA/LMA and thereby perform authentication and
   registration in a single transaction.  The HA acts as a relay entity
   in the access authentication procedure and is aware of the result of
   the authentication procedure and can act on it by updating the
   binding cache.

3.1.  Example

   The figure below shows an example of the solution which combines
   access authentication with mobility registration.  In the figure the
   MN is presumed to already have a binding at the HA.  Additionally the
   same scenario can be considered applicable to the network based
   mobility solution in which case the MAG routes the access
   authentication messages via the LMA.

4.  EAP subtype for Binding Authentication Data

   This specification defines a new subtype, called the EAP
   Authentication Data [EAPAD] subtype, for the Binding Authentication
   Data suboption for Mobile IPv6.  The EAPAD subtype has the following
   format, which is identical to the EAP message format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Code      |  Identifier   |            Length             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |  Type-Data ...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-


   Please consult the EAP specification [RFC3748] for details about
   these header fields.

5.  Binding Acknowledgement Authentication Data option

   The Binding Acknowledgement Authentication Data option [BAckAD] is
   specified to enable the EAP method to return data from the AAA server
   back to the Authenticator and the Peer as may be required by the EAP
   method specification.  The nature of the data returned in the BAckAD
   depends on the method.  The EAP message is of type EAP Success or EAP
   Failure.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
                      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                      |  Option Type  | Option Length |  Subtype      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Code      |  Identifier   |            Length             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |  Type-Data ...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-


   The Subtype for the Binding Acknowledgement Authentication Data
   option is 0, for EAP methods.  There is no need for the SPI field.
   The Type-Data is the EAP method-specific data.  Since this option
   appears in the Binding Acknowledgement (or Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement) message, the Code will either correspond to EAP-
   Success or EAP-Failure.

6.  Example of use with EAP-AKA

   The following figure shows how to use the new Binding Authentication
   Data subtype along with the new Binding Acknowledgement
   Authentication Data subtype with EAP-AKA [RFC4187].  A very similar
   procedure will also work for EAP-AKA' [RFC5448].

   Process C

      means "Server checks the given RES, and MAC and finds them
      correct."

7.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces a new subtype for the Binding Authentication
   Data of Mobile IPv6.  The security characteristics for the
   authentication data are exactly those of the base EAP method which
   defines the data fields and security parameters for the new subtype.

   This document specifies the Binding Acknowledgement Data option,
   which is a new option for the Binding Acknowledgement message of
   Mobile IPv6.  The security characteristics for the new option are
   exactly those of the base EAP method which defines the data fields
   and security parameters for the new option.  The Mobile-Home
   Authentication extension is still also required for the Binding
   Acknowledgement, but additional security features and notifications
   may be included in the EAP method data defining the contents of the
   new option.  PMIP uses the same message format for BAck, and the new
   option works in the same way whether or not the 'P' bit is set.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires allocation of a new subtype for the Binding
   Authentication Option of Mobile IPv6.

   This document specifies the Binding Acknowledgement Data option,
   which is a new option for the Binding Acknowledgement message of
   Mobile IPv6.
