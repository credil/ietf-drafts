      Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) over IP
                     draft-mrw-trill-over-ip-01.txt

Abstract

   The Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol is
   implemented by devices called Routing Bridges (RBridges).  TRILL
   supports both point-to-point and multi-access links and is designed
   so that a variety of link protocols can be used between RBridge
   ports.  This document standardizes methods for encapsulating TRILL in
   UDP/IP(v4 or v6) to provide a unified TRILL campus.

1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   RBridges are devices that implement the IETF TRILL protocol [RFC6325]
   [RFC6326] [RFC6327].

   RBridges provide transparent forwarding of frames within an arbitrary
   network topology, using least cost paths for unicast traffic.  They
   support VLANs and multipathing of unicast and multi-destination
   traffic.  They use IS-IS link state routing and encapsulation with a
   hop count.  The are compatible with IEEE 802.1 customer bridges, and
   can incrementally replace them.

   Two or more RBridges can communicate over a variety of different link
   types, such as Ethernet [RFC6325] or PPP [RFC6361].

   This document defines a method for RBridges to communicate over UPD/
   IP(v4 or v6).  TRILL over IP will allow remote, Internet-connected
   RBridges to form a single RBridge campus, or multiple TRILL over IP
   networks within a campus to be connected as a single TRILL campus via
   a TRILL over IP backbone.

   TRILL over IP connects RBridge ports using IPv4 or IPv6 as a
   transport in such a way that the ports appear to TRILL to be
   connected by a single link.  The link will be a multi-access link if
   more than two RBridge ports are connected via a single TRILL over IP
   link, so that any pair of ports can communicate.

   To support cases where RBridges are connected via links (such as the
   public Internet) that are not under the same administrative control
   as the TRILL campus, this document specifies the use of Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC4327] to secure communication
   between RBridges running TRILL over IP.


3.  Use Cases for TRILL over IP

   In this document, we consider two use cases that are typical of
   situations where network administrators may choose to use TRILL over
   an IP network: a remote office scenario, and an IP backbone scenario.

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                   March 2012


3.1.  Remote Office Scenario

   In the Remote Office Scenario, a remote TRILL network is connected to
   a TRILL campus across a multihop non-TRILL IP network, such as the
   public Internet.  The TRILL network in the remote office becomes a
   logical part of TRILL campus, and nodes in the remote office can be
   attached to the same VLANs as local campus nodes.  In many cases, a
   remote office may be attached to the TRILL campus by a single pair of
   RBridges, one on the campus end, and the other in the remote office.
   In this use case, the TRILL over IP link will often cross logical and
   physical IP networks that do not support TRILL, and are not under the
   same administrative control as the TRILL campus.

3.2.  IP Backbone Scenario

   In the IP Backbone Scenario, TRILL over IP is used to connect a
   number of TRILL networks to form a single TRILL campus.  For example,
   a TRILL over IP backbone could be used to connect multiple TRILL
   networks on different floors of a large building, or to connect TRILL
   networks in separate buildings of a multi-building site.  In this use
   case, there may often be several TRILL RBridges on a single TRILL
   over IP link, and the IP link(s) used by TRILL over IP are typically
   under the same administrative control as the rest of the TRILL
   campus.

3.3.  Important Properties of the Scenarios

   There are a number of differences between the two scenarios listed
   above, some of which drive features of this specification.  These
   differences are especially pertinent to the security requirements of
   the solution, how multicast data frames are handled, and how the
   RBridges discover each other.

3.3.1.  Security Requirements

   In the IP Backbone Scenario, TRILL over IP is used between a number
   of RBridges, on a network link that is in the same administrative
   control as the remainder of the TRILL campus.  While it is desirable
   in this scenario to prevent the association of rogue RBridges, this
   can be accomplished using existing IS-IS security mechanisms.  There
   may be no need to protect the data traffic, beyond any protections
   that are already in place on the local network.

   In the Remote Office Scenario, TRILL over IP may run over a network
   that is not under the same administrative control as the TRILL
   network.  Nodes on the network may think that they are sending
   traffic locally, while that traffic is actually being sent, in a
   UDP/IP tunnel, over the public Internet.  It is necessary in this



Wasserman, et al.      Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                   March 2012


   scenario to protect user privacy, as well as ensuring that no
   unauthorized RBridges can gain access to the RBridge campus.  The
   data privacy requirement is addressed by the use of DTLS for both
   IS-IS frames and data frames between RBridges in this scenario.

3.3.2.  Multicast Handling

   In the IP Backbone scenario, native mutlicast may be supported on the
   TRILL over IP link.  If so, it will be used to send TRILL IS-IS and
   multicast data frames, as discussed later in this document.

   In the Remote Office Scenario, there will often be only one pair of
   RBridges connecting a given site, and even when multiple RBridges are
   used to connect a Remote Office to the TRILL campus, the intervening
   network may not provide reliable (or any) multicast connectivity.
   Also, it is difficult to provide strong data privacy for multicast
   traffic.  For all of these reasons, the connections between local and
   remote RBridges will be treated like point-to-point links, and all
   TRILL IS-IS control messages and multicast data frames that are
   transmitted between the Remote Office and the TRILL campus will be
   serialized, as discussed later in this document.

3.3.3.  RBridge Discovery

   In the IP Backbone Scenario, RBridges that use TRILL over IP will use
   the normal TRILL IS-IS Hello mechanisms to discover the existence of
   other RBridges on the link [RFC6327], and to establish authenticated
   communication with those RBridges.

   In the Remote Office Scenario, a DTLS session will need to be
   established between RBridges before TRILL IS-IS traffic can be
   exchanged, as discussed below.  In this case, one of the RBRidges
   will need to be configured to establish a DTLS session with the other
   RBridge.  This will typically be accomplished by configuring the
   RBridge at a Remote Office to initiate a DTLS session, and subsequent
   TRILL exchanges, with a TRILL over IP-enabled RBridge attached to the
   TRILL campus.


4.  TRILL Frame Formats

   To support the TRILL base protocol standard [RFC6325]. , two types of
   frames will be transmitted between RBridges: TRILL Data frames and
   TRILL IS-IS frames.

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                   March 2012


4.1.  TRILL Data Frame

   The on-the-wire form of a TRILL Data frame in transit between two
   neighboring RBridges is as shown below:


      +--------------+----------+----------------+-----------+
      | TRILL Data   |  TRILL   |  Encapsulated  |   Link    |
      | Link Header  |  Header  |  Native Frame  |  Trailer  |
      +--------------+----------+----------------+-----------+


   Where the Encapsulated Native Frame is in Ethernet frame format with
   a VLAN tag but with no trailing Frame Check Sequence (FCS).

4.2.  TRILL IS-IS Frame

   TRILL IS-IS frames are formatted on-the-wire as follows:


      +--------------+---------------+-----------+
      | TRILL IS-IS  |  TRILL IS-IS  |   Link    |
      | Link Header  |    Payload    |  Trailer  |
      +--------------+---------------+-----------+


   The Link Header and Link Trailer in these formats depend on the
   specific link technology.  The Link Header usually contains one or
   more fields that distinguish TRILL Data from TRILL IS-IS.  For
   example, over Ethernet, the TRILL Data Link Header ends with the
   TRILL Ethertype while the TRILL IS-IS Link Header ends with the L2-
   IS-IS Ethertype; on the other hand, over PPP, there are no Ethertypes
   but PPP protocol code points are included that distinguish TRILL Data
   from TRILL IS-IS.

   In TRILL over IP, we will use UDP/IP (v4 or v6) as the link header,
   and the TRILL frame type will be determined based on the UDP port
   number.  In TRILL over IP, no Link Trailer is specified, although one
   may be added when the resulting IP packets are encapsulated for
   transmission on a network (e.g.  Ethernet).


5.  Link Protocol Specifics

   TRILL Data packets can be unicast to a specific RBridge or multicast
   to all RBridges on the link.  TRILL IS-IS packets are always
   multicast to all other RBridge on the link (except for TRILL IS-IS
   MTU PDUs, which may be unicast).  On Ethernet links, the Ethernet

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                   March 2012


   multicast address All-RBridges is used for TRILL Data and All-IS-IS-
   RBridges for TRILL IS-IS.

   To properly handle TRILL base protocol frames on a TRILL over IP
   link, either native multicast mode must be enabled on that link, or
   multicast must be simulated using serial unicast, as discussed below.

   In TRILL Hello PDUs used on TRILL IP links, the IP addresses of the
   connected IP ports are their SNPA addresses.  Thus, all TRILL
   Neighbor TLVs in such Hellos MUST specify that the size of the SNPA
   is 4-bytes for an IPv4 link or 16-bytes for an IPv6 link
   [rfc6326bis].  Note that SNPA addresses and their size are
   independent of TRILL System IDs which are 6-bytes.


6.  Port Configuration

   Each RBridge port used for a TRILL over IP link MUST have at least
   one IP (v4 or v6) address.  Implementations MAY allow a single
   physical port to operate as multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 logical ports.

   TBD: MUST be able to configure list of IP addresses for serial
   unicast.  MUST be able to configure non-standard IP multi-cast
   addresses.


7.  TRILL over UDP/IP Format

   The general format of a TRILL over UDP/IP packet is shown below.


      +----------+--------+-----------------------+
      | IP       | UDP    |  TRILL                |
      | Header   | Header |  Payload              |
      +----------+--------+-----------------------+


   Where the UDP Header is as follows:


      TBD



8.  Handling Multicast

8.1.  Multicast of TRILL IS-IS Packets

   By default, TRILL IS-IS packets are sent to an IPv4 multicast
   address.

8.2.  Multicast Data Frames

   TBD


9.  Use of DTLS

   All RBridges that support TRILL over IP MUST implement DTLS and
   support the use of DTLS to secure both TRILL IS-IS and data traffic.
   When DTLS is used to secure a TRILL over IP link, the DTLS session
   MUST be fully established before any TRILL IS-IS or data frames are
   exchanged.

   RBridges that implement TRILL over IP MUST support the use of
   certificates for DTLS, and MUST support the following algorithm:

   o  TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA [RFC5246]

   RBridges that support TRILL over IP MAY support the use of pre-shared
   keys for DTLS.  If the communicating RBridges have IS-IS
   authentication enabled with a pre-shared key, then that key may be
   used for DTLS unless some other pre-shared key is configured.  If
   pre-shared keys are supported, the following cryptographic algorithms
   MUST be supported for use with pre-shared keys:

   o  TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA [RFC5246]


10.  Transport Considerations

10.1.  Recursive Encapsulation

   TRILL is designed to transport end station Ethernet traffic and IP is
   frequently transported over Ethernet.  Thus, an end station Ethernet
   frame EF might get TRILL encapsulated to TRILL(EF) which was then
   send on a TRILL over IP over Ethernet link resulting in an Ethernet
   frame of the form Ethernet(IP(TRILL(EF))).  There is a risk of such
   an Ethernet frame being re-ingressed by the same TRILL campus, due to
   physical or logical misconfiguration, looping round, being further
   encapsulated and re-ingressed, etc.  The frame might get discarded if
   it got too large but if fragmentation is enabled, it would just keep
   getting split into fragment that would continue to loop and grow and
   re-fragment until the path was saturated with junk and frames were



Wasserman, et al.      Expires September 13, 2012               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                   March 2012


   being discarded due to queue overflow.  TTL would provide no
   protection because each TRILL encapsulation adds a new TTL.

   To protect against this scenario, TRILL over IP output ports MUST be
   able to test whether a TRILL frame they are above to send is, in fact
   a TRILL encapsulation of a TRILL over IP over Ethernet frame.  That
   is, is it of the form TRILL(Ethernet(IP(TRILL(...))).  If so, the
   default action of the TRILL over IP output port is to discard the
   frame.  However, there are cases where some level of multiple
   encapsulations is desired so it MUST be possible to configure the
   port to allow such frames.


11.  MTU Considerations

   In TRILL each RBridge advertises the largest LSP frame it can accept
   (but not less than 1,470 bytes) on any of its interfaces (at least
   those interfaces with adjacencies to other RBridges in the campus) in
   its LSP number zero through the originatingLSPBufferSize TLV
   [RFC6325] [rfc6326bis].  The campus minimum MTU, denoted Sz, is then
   established by taking the minimum of this advertised MTU for all
   RBridges in the campus.  Links that do not meet the Sz MTU are not
   included in the routing topology.  This protects the operation of
   IS-IS from links that would be unable to accommodate some LSPs.

   Exact methods of determining originatingLSPBufferSize for an RBridge
   with one or more TRILL over IP ports are beyond the scope of this
   document.  However, if an IP link either can accommodate jumbo frames
   or is a link on which IP fragmentation is enabled and acceptable,
   then it is unlikely that the IP link will be a constraint on the
   RBridge's originatingLSPBufferSize.  On the other hand, if the IP
   link can only handle smaller frames and fragmentation is to be
   avoided when possible, a TRILL over IP port might constrain the
   RBridge's originatingLSPBufferSize.  Because TRILL sets the minimum
   values of Sz at 1,470 bytes, there may be links that meet the minimum
   MTU for the IP protocol (1,280 bytes for IPv6, theoretically 68 bytes
   for IPv4) on which it would be necessary to enable fragmentation for
   TRILL use.

   The optional use of TRILL IS-IS MTU PDUs, as specified in [RFC6325]
   and [RFC6327] can provide added assurance of the actual MTU of a
   link.


12.  Middlebox Considerations

   TBD

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                   March 2012


13.  Security Considerations

   TRILL over IP is subject to all of the security considerations for
   the base TRILL protocol.  In addition, there are specific security
   requirements for different TRILL deployment scenarios, as discussed
   in the "Use Cases for TRILL over IP" section above.

   This document specifies that all RBridges that support TRILL over IP
   MUST implement DTLS, and makes it clear that it is both wise and good
   to use DTLS in all cases where a TRILL over IP link will traverse a
   network that is not under the same administrative control as the rest
   of the TRILL campus.  DTLS is necessary, in these cases to protect
   the privacy and integrity of data traffic.

   TRILL over IP is completely compatible with the use of IS-IS
   security, which can be used to authenticte RBridges before allowing
   them to join a TRILL campus.  This is sufficient to protect against
   rogue RBridges, but is not sufficient to protect data frames that may
   be sent, in UDP/IP tunnels, outside of the local network, or even
   across the public Internet.  To protect the privacy and integrity of
   that traffic, use DTLS.

   In cases were DTLS is used, the use of IS-IS security may not be
   necessary, but there is nothing about this specification that would
   prevent using both DTLS and IS-IS security together.  In cases where
   both types of security are enabled, implementations MAY allow users
   to configure a single shared key that will be used for both
   mechanisms.


14.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated the following UDP Ports for the TRILL IS-IS and
   Data channels:


          UDP Port           Protocol

          (TBD)              TRILL IS-IS Channel
          (TBD)              TRILL Data Channel


   IANA has allocated one IPv4 and one IPv6 multicast address, as shown
   below, which correspond to the All-RBridges and All-IS-IS-RBridges
   multicast MAC addresses that the IEEE Registration Authority has
   assigned for TRILL.  Because the low level hardware MAC address
   dispatch considerations for TRILL over Ethernet do not apply to TRILL
   over IP, one IP multicast address for each version of IP is



Wasserman, et al.      Expires September 13, 2012              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                TRILL over IP                   March 2012


   sufficient.

   [Values recommended to IANA:]


         Name                 IPv4              IPv6

         All-RBridges         233.252.14.0      FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:205


   Note: when these IPv4 and IPv6 multicast addresses are used and the
   resulting IP frame is sent over Ethernet, the usual IP derived MAC
   address is used.

   [Need to discuss scopes for IPv6 multicast (the "X" in the addresses)
   somewhere.  Default to "site" scope but MUST be configurable?]
