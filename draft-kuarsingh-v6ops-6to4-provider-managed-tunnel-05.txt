         draft-kuarsingh-v6ops-6to4-provider-managed-tunnel-05

Abstract

   6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework which
   can help manage 6to4 [RFC3056] tunnels operating in an anycast
   [RFC3068] configuration.  The 6to4-PMT framework is intended to serve
   as an option to operators to help improve the experience of 6to4
   operation when conditions of the network may provide sub-optimal
   performance or break normal 6to4 operation. 6to4-PMT provides a
   stable provider prefix and forwarding environment by utilizing
   existing 6to4 Relays with an added function of IPv6 Prefix
   Translation.  This operation may be particularly important in NAT444
   infrastructures where a customer endpoint may be assigned a non-
   RFC1918 address thus breaking the return path for anycast [RFC3068]
   based 6to4 operation.

Internet-Draft        6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels        February 2012


1.  Introduction

   6to4 [RFC3056] tunnelling along with the anycast operation described
   in [RFC3068] is widely deployed in modern Operating Systems and off
   the shelf gateways sold throughout the retail and OEM channels.
   Anycast [RFC3068] based 6to4 allows for tunnelled IPv6 connectivity
   through IPv4 clouds without explicit configuration of a relay
   address.  Since the overall system utilizes anycast forwarding in
   both directions, flow paths are difficult to determine, tend to
   follow separate paths in either direction, and often change based on
   network conditions.  The return path is normally uncontrolled by the
   local operator and can contribute to poor performance for IPv6, and
   can also act as a breakage point.  Many of the challenges with 6to4
   are described in [RFC6343].  A specific critical use case for
   problematic anycast 6to4 operation is related to conditions where the
   consumer endpoints are downstream from a northbound CGN [RFC6264]
   function when assigned non-RFC1918 IPv4 addresses, which are not
   routed on interdomain links.

   Operators which are actively deploying IPv6 networks and operate
   legacy IPv4 access environments may want to utilize the existing 6to4
   behaviour in customer site resident hardware and software as an
   interim option to reach the IPv6 Internet in advance of being able to
   offer full native IPv6.  Operators may also need to address the
   brokenness related to 6to4 operation originating from behind a
   provider NAT function. 6to4-PMT offers an operator the opportunity to
   utilize IPv6 Prefix Translation to enable deterministic traffic flow
   and an unbroken path to and from the Internet for IPv6 based traffic
   sourced originally from these 6to4 customer endpoints.

   6to4-PMT translates the prefix portion of the IPv6 address from the
   6to4 generated prefix to a provider assigned prefix which is used to
   represent the source.  This translation will then provide a stable
   forward and return path for the 6to4 traffic by allowing the existing
   IPv6 routing and policy environment to control the traffic. 6to4-PMT
   is primarily intended to be used in a stateless manner to maintain
   many of the elements inherent in normal 6to4 operation.
   Alternatively, 6to4-PMT can be used in a stateful translation mode
   should the operator choose this option.


2.  Motivation

   Many operators endeavour to deploy IPv6 as soon as possible so as to
   ensure uninterrupted connectivity to all Internet applications and
   content through the IPv4 to IPv6 transition process.  The IPv6
   preparations within these organizations are often faced with both
   financial challenges and timing issues related to deploying IPv6 to



Kuarsingh, et al.        Expires August 19, 2012                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels        February 2012


   the network edge and related transition technologies.  Many of the
   new technologies available for IPv4 to IPv6 transition will require
   the replacement of the customer CPE to support technologies like 6RD
   [RFC5969], Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333] and Native Dual Stack.

   Operators face a number of challenges related to home equipment
   replacement.  Operator initiated replacement of this equipment will
   take time due to the nature of mass equipment refresh programs or may
   require the consumer to replace their own gear.  Replacing consumer
   owned and operated equipment, compounded by the fact that there is
   also a general unawareness of what IPv6 is, also adds to the
   challenges faced by operators.  It is also important to note that
   6to4 is found in much of the equipment found in networks today which
   do not as of yet, or will not, support 6RD and/or Native IPv6.

   Operators may still be motivated to provide a form of IPv6
   connectivity to customers and would want to mitigate potential issues
   related to IPv6-only deployments elsewhere on the Internet.
   Operators also need to mitigate issues related to the fact that 6to4
   operation often is on by default and may be subject to erroneous
   behaviour.  The undesired behaviour may be related to the use of non-
   RFC1918 addresses on CPE equipment which operate behind large NATs,
   or other conditions as described in a general advisory as laid out in
   [RFC6343].

   6to4-PMT allows an operator to help mitigate such challenges by
   leveraging the existing 6to4 deployment base, while maintaining
   operator control of access to the IPv6 Internet.  It is intended for
   use when better options, such as 6RD or Native IPv6, are not yet
   viable.  One of key objectives of 6to4-PMT is to also help reverse
   the negative impacts of 6to4 in CGN environments.  The 6to4-PMT
   operation can also be used immediately with the default parameters
   which are often enough to allow it to operate in a 6to4-PMT
   environment.  Once native IPv6 is available to the endpoint, the
   6to4-PMT operation is no longer needed and will cease to be used
   based on correct address selection behaviours in end hosts [RFC3484].

   6to4-PMT thus helps operators remove the impact of 6to4 in CGN
   environments, deals with the fact that 6to4 is often on by default,
   allows access to IPv6-only endpoints from IPv4-only addressed
   equipment and provides relief from many challenges related to mis-
   configuations in other networks which control return flows via
   foreign relays.  Due to the simple nature of 6to4-PMT, it can also be
   implemented in a cost effective and simple manner allowing operators
   to concentrate their energy on deploying Native IPv6.

3.  6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels

3.1.  6to4 Provider Managed Tunnel Model

   The 6to4 managed tunnel model behaves like a standard 6to4 service
   between the customer IPv6 host or gateway and the 6ot4-PMT Relay
   (within the provider domain).  The 6to4-PMT Relay shares properties
   with 6RD [RFC5969] by decapsulating and forwarding encapsulated IPv6
   flows within an IPv4 packet, to the IPv6 Internet.  The model
   provides an additional function which translates the source 6to4
   prefix to a provider assigned prefix which is not found in 6RD
   [RFC5969] or traditional 6to4 operation.

   The 6to4-PMT Relay is intended to provide a stateless (or stateful)
   mapping of the 6to4 prefix to a provider supplied prefix.

          | CPE |-------------|6to4 BR |--| PT66 |--------- |Host|
          +-----+    IPv4     +--------+  +------+ Provider +----+

                    Figure 1: 6to4-PMT Functional Model

   This mode of operation is seen as beneficial when compared to broken
   6to4 paths and/or environments where 6to4 operation may be functional
   but highly degraded.

3.2.  Traffic Flow

   Traffic in the 6to4-PMT model is intended to be controlled by the
   operator's IPv6 peering operations.  Egress traffic is managed
   through outgoing routing policy, and incoming traffic is influenced
   by the operator assigned prefix advertisements using normal
   interdormain routing functions.

   The routing model is as predictable as native IPv6 traffic and legacy
   IPv4 based traffic.  Figure 2 provides a view of the routing topology
   needed to support this relay environment.  The diagram references
   PrefixA as 2002::/16 and PrefixB as the example 2001:db8::/32.

                       Figure 2: 6to4-PMT Flow Model

   Traffic between two 6to4 enabled devices would use the IPv4 path for
   communication according to RFC3056 unless the local host still
   prefers traffic via a relay. 6to4-PMT is intended to be deployed in
   conjunction with the 6to4 relay function in an attempt to help
   simplify it's deployment.  The model can also provide the ability for
   an operator to forward both 6to4-PMT (translated) and normal 6to4
   flows (untranslated) simultaneously based on configured policy.

3.3.  Prefix Translation

   IPv6 Prefix Translation is a key part of the system as a whole.  The
   6to4-PMT framework is a combination of two concepts: 6to4 [RFC3056]
   and IPv6 Prefix Translation.  IPv6 Prefix Translation has some
   similarities to concepts discussed in [RFC6296]. 6to4-PMT would
   provide prefix translation based on specific rules configured on the
   translator which maps the 6to4 2002::/16 prefix to an appropriate
   provider assigned prefix.  In most cases, a ::/32 prefix would work
   best in 6to4-PMT which matches common RIR assignment designations to
   operators.

   The provider can use any prefix mapping strategy they so choose, but
   the simpler the better.  Simple direct bit mapping can be used, or
   more advanced forms of translation should the operator want to
   achieve higher address compression.  More advanced forms of
   translation may require the use of stateful translation.

   Figure 3 shows a 6to4 Prefix with a Subnet ID of "0000" mapped to a
   provider assigned globally unique prefix (2001:db8::/32).  With this
   simple form of translation, there is support for only one Subnet-ID
   per provider assigned prefix.  In characterization of deployed OSs
   and gateways, a Subnet-ID of "0000" is the most common default case
   followed by Subnet ID "0001".  Use of Subnet ID can be referenced in
   [RFC4291].  It should be noted that in normal 6to4 operation the
   endpoint (network) has access to 65,536 (16-bits) Subnet IDs.  In the

   PMT case as described above using the mapping in Figure 3, all but
   the one Subnet ID used for PMT would still operate under normal 6to4
   operation.

3.4.  Translation State

   It is preferred that the overall system use deterministic prefix
   translation mappings such that stateless operation can be
   implemented.  This allows the provider to place N number of relays
   within the network without the need to manage translation state.
   Deterministic translation also allows a customer to use inward
   services using the translated (provider prefix) address.

   If stateful operation is chosen, the operator would need to validate
   state and routing requirements particular to that type of deployment.
   The full body of considerations for this type of deployment are not
   within this scope of this document.


4.  Deployment Considerations and Requirements

4.1.  Customer Opt-out

   A provider enabling this function should provide a method to allow
   customers to opt-out of such a service should the customer choose to
   maintain normal 6to4 operation irrespective of degraded performance.
   In cases where the customer is behind a CGN device, the customer
   would not be advised to opt-out and can also be assisted to turn off
   6to4.

   Since the 6to4-PMT system is targeted at customers who are relatively



Kuarsingh, et al.        Expires August 19, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels        February 2012


   unaware of IPv6 and IPv4, and normally run network equipment with a
   default configuration, an opt-out strategy is recommended.  This
   method provides the 6to4-PMT operation for non-IPv6 savvy customers
   whose equipment may turn on 6to4 automatically and allows savvy
   customers to easily configure their way around the 6to4-PMT function.

   Capable customers can also disable anycast based 6to4 entirely and
   use traditional 6to4 or other tunnelling mechanisms if they are so
   inclined.  This is not considered the normal case, and most endpoints
   with auto-6to4 operation will be subject to 6to4-PMT operation since
   most users are unaware of it's existence. 6to4-PMT is targeted as an
   option for stable IPv6 connectivity for average consumers.

4.2.  Shared CGN Space Considerations

   6to4-PMT operation can also be used to mitigate a known problem with
   6to4 when Shared CGN Space [I-D.weil-shared-transition-space-request]
   or Global Unicast Addresses (GUA) that are used behind a CGN and not
   routed on the Internet.  Non-RFC but un-routed address space would
   cause many deployed OSs and network equipment to potentially auto-
   enable 6to4 operation even without a valid return path (such as
   behind a CGN function).  The Operators' desire to use Non-RFC1918 or
   Shared CGN Space is considered highly likely based on real world
   deployments.

   Such hosts, in normal cases, would send 6to4 traffic to the IPv6
   Internet via the IPv4 anycast relay, which would in fact provide
   broken IPv6 connectivity since the return path flow is built using an
   IPv4 address that is not routed or assigned to the source Network.
   The use of 6to4-PMT would help reverse these effects by translating
   the 6to4 prefix to a provider assigned prefix, masking this automatic
   and undesired behaviour.

4.3.  End to End Transparency

   6to4-PMT mode operation removes the traditional end to end
   transparency of 6to4.  Remote hosts would connect to a 6to4-PMT
   subject host using a translated IPv6 address versus the original 6to4
   address based on the 2002::/16 well-known prefix.  This can be seen
   as a disadvantage of the 6to4-PMT system.  This lack of transparency
   should also be contrasted with the normal operating state of 6to4
   which provides uncontrolled and often high latency prone
   connectivity.  The lack of transparency is however a better form of
   operation when extreme poor performance, broken IPv6 connectivity, or
   no IPv6 connectivity is considered as the alternative.

Internet-Draft        6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels        February 2012


4.4.  Path MTU Discovery Considerations

   The MTU will be subject to a reduced value due to standard 6to4
   tunnelling operation.  Under normal 6to4 operation, the 6to4 service
   agent would send an ICMP Packet Too Big Message as part of Path MTU
   Discovery as described in [RFC4443] and [RFC1981] respectively.  In
   6to4-PMT operation, the PMT Service agent should be aware of the
   reduced 6to4 MTU and send ICMP messages using the translated address
   accordingly.

   It is also possible to pre-constrain the MTU at the upstream router
   from the 6to4-PMT service agents which would then have the upstream
   router send the appropriate ICMP Packet Too Big Messages.

4.5.  Routing Requirements

   The provider would need to advertise the well-known IP address range
   used for normal anycast 6to4 [RFC3068] operation within the local
   IPv4 routing environment.  This advertisement would attract the 6to4
   upstream traffic to a local relay.  To control this environment and
   make sure all northbound traffic lands on a provider controlled, the
   operator may filter the anycast range from being advertised from
   customer endpoints toward the network (upstream propagation).

   The provider would not be able to control route advertisements inside
   the customer domain, but that use case is in scope for this document.
   It is likely in that case the end network/customer understands 6to4
   and is maintaining their own relay environment and therefore would
   not be subject to the operators 6to4 and/or PMT operation.

   The provider would also likely want to advertise the 2002::/16 range
   within their own network to help bridge traditional 6to4 traffic
   within their own network (Native IPv6 to 6to4-PMT based endpoint).
   It would also be advised that the local 6to4-PMT operator not leak
   the well-known 6to4 anycast IPv4 prefix to neighboring Autonomous
   Systems to prevent PMT operation for neighboring networks.  Policy
   configuration on the local 6to4-PMT relay can also be used to
   disallow PMT operation should the local provider service downstream
   customer networks.

4.6.  Relay Deployments

   The 6to4-PMT function can be deployed onto existing 6to4 relays (if
   desired) to help minimize network complexity. 6ot4-PMT has already
   been developed on Linux based platforms which are package add-ons to
   the traditional 6to4 code.  The only additional considerations beyond
   normal 6to4 relay operation would include the need to route specific
   IPv6 provider prefix ranges used for PMT operation towards peers and

   transit providers.


5.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations are defined at this time.


6.  Security Considerations

   6to4-PMT operation would be subject to the same security concerns as
   normal 6to4 operation. 6to4-PMT is also not plainly perceptible by
   external hosts and local entities appear as Native IPv6 hosts to the
