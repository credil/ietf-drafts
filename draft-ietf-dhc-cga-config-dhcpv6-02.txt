Abstract 

   A Cryptographically Generated Address is an IPv6 addresses binding 
   with a public/private key pair. However, the current CGA 
   specifications are lack of procedures to enable proper management of 
   the usage of CGAs. This document defines the process using DHCPv6 to 
   manage CGAs in detail. A new DHCPv6 option is defined accordingly. 
   This document also analyses the configuration of the parameters, 
   which are used to generate CGAs, using DHCPv6. Although the document 
   does not define new DHCPv6 option to carry these parameters for 
   various reasons, the configuration procedure is described.

1. Introduction 

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA, [RFC3972]) provide means 
   to verify the ownership of IPv6 addresses without requiring any 
   security infrastructure such as a certification authority. 

   CGAs were originally designed for SeND [RFC3971] and SeND is 
   generally not used in the same environment as a Dynamic Host 
   Configure Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] server. However, after 
   CGA has been defined, as an independent security property, many other 
   CGA usages have been proposed and defined, such as Site Multihoming 
   by IPv6 Intermediation (SHIM6) [RFC5533], Enhanced Route Optimization 
   for Mobile IPv6 [RFC4866], also using the CGA for DHCP security 
   purpose [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6], etc. The use of CGAs allows 
   identity verification in different protocols. In these scenarios, 
   CGAs may be used in DHCPv6-managed networks. 

   As [I-D.ietf-csi-dhcpv6-cga-ps] analyses, in the current 
   specifications, there is a lack of procedures to enable proper 
   management of the usage of CGAs. Particularly, in a DHCPv6-managed 
   network, a new DHCPv6 option is missed, therefore, the DHCPv6 server 
   can NOT grant the use of host-generated CGA addresses on request from 
   the client, or reject the CGA on the basis of a too-low sec value. In 
   order to fill this gap, a new DHCPv6 option, CGA Grant Option, is 
   defined in this document. 

   This document also analyses the configuration of the parameters, 
   which are used to generate CGAs, using DHCPv6. Although the document 
   does not define new DHCPv6 option to carry these parameters for 
   various reasons, the configuration procedure is described. The 
   procedure works with existing options or future define options. 

   The CGA configuration procedure described in this document can work 
   with a generic address registration mechanism, which discussed in 
   IETF DHC Working Group, but have not been defined yet. However, even 
   a generic address registration mechanism was defined, the CGA-
   specific option, CGA Grant Option, is still needed so that DHCP 
   server can indicate hosts the recommended CGA Sec value. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3. CGA Configure Process Using DHCPv6 

   The CGA specifications [RFC3972] define the procedure to generate a 
   CGA. However, it assumes that hosts decide by itself or have been 
   preconfigured all CGA relevant parameters. In reality, the network 
   management MAY want to assign/enforcement some parameters to hosts; 
   the network management MAY also manage the use of CGAs. 

   Among the mechanisms in which configuration parameters could be 
   pushed to the end hosts and/or CGA related information sent back to a 
   central administration, we discuss the stateful configuration 
   mechanism based on DCHPv6 in this document. Other mechanisms may also 
   provide similar functions, but out of scope. 

   In this section, configuration CGA parameters and that a DHCPv6 
   server grants the CGA usage are described in details. 

3.1. Configuration of the parameters required for the generation of CGA 

   Each CGA is associated with a CGA Parameters data structure, which is 
   formed by all input parameters [RFC3972] except for Sec value that is 
   embedded in the CGA. The CGA associated Parameters used to generate a 
   CGA includes: 

     - a Public Key, 

     - a Subnet Prefix, 

     - a 3-bit security parameter, Sec. Additionally, it should be noted 
     that the hash algorithm to be used in the generation of the CGA is 
     also defined by the Sec value [RFC4982], 

     - any Extension Fields that could be used. 

     - Note: the modifier and the Collision Count value in the CGA 
     Parameter data structure are generated during the CGA generation 
     process. They do NOT need to be configured. 

   In a DHCPv6 managed network, a host may initiate a request for the 
   relevant CGA configuration information needed to the DHCPv6 server. 
   The server responds with the configuration information for the host. 
   The Option Request Option, defined in Section 22.7 in [RFC3315], can 
   be used for host to indicate which options the client requests from 
   the server. For response, the requested Option should be included. 
   The server MAY also initiatively push these parameters by attaching 
   these option in the response messages which are initiated for other 
   purposes.

     - The Public/Private key pair is generated by hosts themselves and 
     considered not suitable for network transmission for security 
     reasons. The configuration of the client key pair or certificate is 
     out of scope. 

     - Currently, there are convenient mechanisms for allowing an 
     administrator to configure the subnet prefix for a host, by Router 
     Advertisement [RFC4861, RFC4862]. However, this does not suitable 
     for the DHCP-managed network. To propagate the prefix through DHCP 
     interactions, DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation Option [RFC3633] MAY be  
     used. However, this option was designed to assign prefix block for 
     routers. A new Prefix Assignment Option MAY need to be defined. 
     Since alternative approach is existing and there are debates 
     whether a new Prefix Assignment Option MAY is necessary, this 
     document does not define it. 

     - Although the network management MAY want to enforce or configure 
     a Sec value to the hosts, it is considered as a very dangerous 
     action. A malicious fake server may send out a high Sec value to 
     attack clients giving the fact that generation a CGA with a high 
     Sec value is very computational intensive  
     [I-D.ietf-csi-dhcpv6-cga-ps]. Another risk is that a malicious 
     server could propagate a Sec value providing less protection than 
     intended by the network administrator, facilitating a brute force 
     attack against the hash, or the selection of the weakest hash 
     algorithm available for CGA definition. A recommendation Sec value 
     is considered as confusion information. The receiving host is lack 
     for information to make choose whether generates a CGA according to 
     the recommendation or not. Therefore, the document does not define 
     a DHCPv6 option to propagate the Sec value. 

     - Although there is an optional Extension Fields in CGA Parameter 
     data structure, there is NO any defined extension fields. If in the 
     future, new Extension Fields in CGA Parameter data structure are 
     defined, future specification may define correspondent DHCPv6 
     options to carry these parameters. 

   Upon reception of the CGA relevant parameters from DHCPv6 server, the 
   end hosts SHOULD generate addresses compliant with the received 
   parameters. If the parameters change, the end hosts SHOULD generate 
   new addresses compliant with the parameters propagated. 

3.2. Host requests CGA Approved to the DHCPv6 server 

   A CGA address is generated by the associated key pair owner, normally 
   an end host. However, in a DHCPv6-managed network, hosts should use 
   IPv6 global addresses only from a DHCPv6 server. The process

   described below allows a host, also DHCPv6 client, uses self-
   generated CGAs in a DHCPv6-managed environment, by requesting the 
   granting from a DHCPv6 server. 

   The client sends a CGA, which is generated by itself, to a DHCPv6 
   server, and requests the DHCP server to determine whether the 
   generated CGA satisfies the requirements of the network  
   configuration, wherein the network configuration comprises a CGA 
   security level set by the DHCP; and generates a new CGA if the 
   generated CGA does not satisfy the requirements of the network 
   configuration. 

   Client initiation behavior 

   In details, a DHCPv6 client SHOULD send a DHCPv6 Request message to 
   initiate the CGA granting process. 

   This DHCPv6 Request message MUST include an Option Request option, 
   which requests the CGA Grant Option, defined in Section 4 in this 
   document, to indicate the DHCPv6 server responses with the address 
   granting decision. 

   The client MUST include one or more IA Options, either IA_NA or IA 
   _TA, in the Request message. Each IA Option MUST includes one or more 
   IA Address Options. CGAs are carried in the IA Address Options. 

   Server behavior 

   Upon reception of the Request message, the DHCPv6 server SHOULD 
   verify whether the client's CGAs satisfy the CGA-related 
   configuration parameters of the network. The DHCPv6 server SHOULD NOT 
   handle the Request which the CGA_Grant field is not all 1(FFx). The 
   DHCPv6 server then send an acknowledgement, a Reply message, to the 
   client to either grant the use of the CGA or decline the requested 
   CGA. The CGA_Grant field SHOULD be set following the rule, defined in 
   Section 4 in this document. When the requested CGA is declined, the 
   DHCPv6 server MAY also recommend a Sec value to the client using the 
   CGA Grant option in the DHCPv6 Reply message. 

   In the meantime, the DHCPv6 server MAY log the requested CGA 
   addresses. This information MAY later be used by other network 
   functions, such as ACL. 

   Client receiving behavior 

   Upon reception of the acknowledgement from server, the client can 
   legally use the granted CGAs. The client SHOULD silently drop any

   message that has the CGA_Grant field set any other value, but F0x, or 
   00x~07x. If the server declines the requested CGA, the client MAY 
   generate a new CGA with the recommended Sec value. If the server 
   replies with CGA-relevant parameters, the client MAY generate a new 
   CGA accordingly. 

4. CGA Grant Option 

   DHCPv6 CGA Grant Option is used to indicate the DHCPv6 client whether 
   the requested address is granted or not. In the decline case, a 
   recommended Sec value MAY be sent, too.

       CGA_Grant 

         The CGA_Grant field sets all 1 (FFx) when a client requests 
         granting from server in the DHCPv6 Request message. 

         In the DHCPv6 reply message, the CGA_Grant field sets F0x to 
         indicate that the requested CGA is granted; it sets 00x to 
         indicate that the requested Address is declined without any 
         recommended Sec value. It sets 01x~07x to indicate that 
         requested Address is declined and the recommended Sec value 
         (value from 1~7). 

   Note: On receiving the CGA Grant Option with reject information and a 
   recommended Sec value, the client MAY generate a new CGA with the 
   recommended Sec value. . If choosing not use the recommended Sec 
   value, the client MAY take the risk that it is not able to use full 
   network capabilities. The network may consider the hosts that use 
   CGAs with lower Sec values as unsecure users and decline some or all 
   network services.

5. Security Considerations 

   The mechanisms based on DHCPv6 are all vulnerable to attacks to the 
   DHCP client. Proper use of DHCPv6 autoconfiguration facilities 
   [RFC3315], such as AUTH option or Secure DHCP  
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6] can prevent these threats, provided that 
   a configuration token is known to both the client and the server. 

   IF a DHCPv6 server rejected a client CGA based on a certain Sec 
   value, it SHOULD NOT suggest a new Sec value either equal or lower
   than the  Sec value that has been rejected. 

   Note that, as expected, it is not possible to provide secure 
   configuration of CGA without a previous configuration of security 
   information at the client (either a trust anchor, or a DHCPv6 
   configuration token, etc.). However, considering that the values of 
   these elements could be shared by the hosts in the network segment, 
   these security elements can be configured more easily in the end 
   hosts than its addresses. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines two new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options, which must be 
   assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space for 
   DHCPv6 messages: 

   The DHCPv6 CGA Grant Option, OPTION_ADDR_GRANT (TBA1), described in 
   Section 4.
