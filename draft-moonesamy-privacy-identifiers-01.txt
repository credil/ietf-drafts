Abstract

   The Internet provides the ability for information to be spread beyond
   geographical boundaries at the speed of light.  Once information is
   available over the Internet it leaves the private realm.  If the
   information can be used to identify a person it can affect the
   privacy of the individual.  There are cases when it can increase the
   physical risk to the individual or where it can have a negative
   financial impact.  Some types of information can be an embarassment
   to an individual and negatively affect the person's reputation.

   This document discusses about identifiers in the context of privacy.

1.  Background

   In 1657 the General Post Office was set up in England, Scotland and
   Ireland [Ord1].  One of the secondary purposes was "to discover and
   prevent many dangerous, and wicked designs".  In 1844 there was a
   political row after it was discovered that the Post Office was
   intercepting letters.

   In 1881 French law about the freedom of the press [Leg1] offered
   protection for facts about an individual's private life by giving the
   individual the ability to seek redress by legal means if these facts
   were published by the press.  In 1890 [Leg2] it was mentioned that
   recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next
   step which must be taken for the protection of the person, and for
   securing the individual.

   In 1948 the United Declaration of Human Rights [Leg3] stated that "No
   one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,
   family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and
   reputation.  Everyone has the right to the protection of the law
   against such interference or attacks".

   In 2000 the IETF published a policy on wiretapping [RFC2804].  One of
   the observations was that "experience shows that tools designed for
   one purpose that are effective for another tend to be used for that
   other purpose too, no matter what its designers intended".

2.  Introduction

   The Internet provides the ability for information to be spread beyond
   geographical boundaries at the speed of light.  Once information is
   available over the Internet it leaves the private realm.  Although
   there is the ability to seek redress by legal means if information
   about an individual's private life is being distributed publicly over
   the Internet, it can be an impossible task when multiple juridictions
   are involved.  In essence, the information cannot be contained once
   it leaves the private realm.

   If the information shared can be used to identify a person it can
   affect the privacy of the individual.  There are cases when it can
   increase the physical risk to the individual or where it can have a
   negative financial impact.  Some types of information can be an
   embarassment to an individual and negatively affect the person's
   reputation.

   This document discusses about identifiers in the context of privacy.

2.1.  Note

   This Internet-Draft can be discussed on the ietf-privacy@ietf.org
   mailing list.  [RFC-Editor: please remove this paragraph]

3.  Link Layer Identifiers

   A link layer identifier, such as a MAC address, is used to identify a
   physical device.  A link layer identifier, in contrast with
   identifiers used at other layers, is considered as a physical
   identifier as it is embedded in the device.

4.  Internet Identifiers

4.1.  IP address

   An Internet Identifier known as an IP address indicates where it is
   [RFC0791].

4.2.  Email address

   An email address is a character string that identifies a user to whom
   mail will be sent or a location into which mail will be deposited
   [RFC5321].

5.  Session Identifiers

   A Session Identifier uniquely identifies a communication session.
   For example, a cookie [RFC6265] is session identifier used by HTTP
   servers to store state.  The HTTP server can send the user agent a
   cookie.  The user agent returns that cookie in subsequent requests.
   There are two types of cookies, session cookies and persistent
   cookies.  A session cookie is destroyed when the user agent is
   closed.  A persistent cookie is preserved across multiple sessions
   and is only destroyed once it reaches its expiration date.

6.  The right amount of information

   When a person explicitly addresses the remote end at the IP layer the
   person consents to the transmission of the IP address assigned to
   local end.  The IP addresses of the two end-hosts are necessary for
   IP-layer communication to be possible.  When a person sends an email
   the person consents to the transmission of an email address.  The
   email address is necessary for the recipient of the email to be able
   to reply to it.

   As a short-lived mechanism to store state it can be argued that a
   session identifier such as a session cookie is necessary to provide
   the functionality for a communication session.  There may be valid
   reasons for having a persistent cookie, for example, to store the
   preferences of the individual.  A persistent cookie can also be used
   to track a person's usage of a service.  If the intention of the
   person is not clear, he/she may have to be asked for consent.

   In an all-or-nothing proposition a person is faced with the
   inevitable choice of sharing information to be able to communicate.
   The interests and motivation of the two ends (e.g. the entity
   providing a service at one end and the person using the service at
   the other end) are not aligned.  It is difficult for the average
   person to take an informed decision about the amount of personal data
   that needs to be shared.  There is an implicit assumption that the
   underlying protocols are transmitting the right amount of information
   needed for the protocols to work.  There is a reasonable expectation
   that the person will be provided with a cautionary notice to which he
   /she must consent to if the information being disclosed may adversely
   affect the person.

7.  Security Considerations

   It is a myth that people become anonymous when they are in a crowd.
   Naive users view the Internet as a place where they are anonymous and
   by extension, incorrectly assume they should not be concerned about
   their privacy.

   Privacy policies usually end up as disclaimers of liability instead
   of policies aimed at protecting privacy.

8.  Recommendations

      It is recommended that an identifier be used at the layer at which
      its functionality is necessary for communication to be
      established.

      It is recommended not to transmit link layer identifiers over the
      Internet.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any action from IANA.
