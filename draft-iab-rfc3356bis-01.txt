Abstract

   This document provides guidance to aid in the understanding of
   collaboration on standards development between the International
   Telecommunication Union -- Telecommunication Standardization
   Sector (ITU-T) and the Internet Society (ISOC) -- Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF).  It is an update of and obsoletes
   RFC 3356.  The updates reflect changes in the IETF and ITU-T
   since RFC 3356 was written.  The bulk of this document is common
   text with ITU-T Supplement 3 to the ITU-T A-Series
   Recommendations.

   Note:  This was approved by ITU-T TSAG on xx July 2012 as a
   Supplement to the ITU-T A-Series of Recommendations (will be
   numbered as A-Series Supplement 3).

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance
   with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines     January 2012


[The following note to be removed upon publication as an RFC]

Editors' Note:

   This Informational Internet-Draft is intended for publication as an
   RFC with the IAB stream, and is subject to the publication process
   described in RFC 4845.

1. Scope

   This document provides guidance to aid in the understanding of
   collaboration on standards development between the ITU-T and the
   Internet Society (ISOC) -- Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF).

   In the IETF, work is done in Working Groups (WG), mostly through
   open, public mailing lists rather than face-to-face meetings.
   WGs are organized into Areas, each Area being managed by two co-
   Area Directors.  Collectively, the Area Directors comprise the
   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).

   In the ITU-T, work is defined by study Questions which are
   worked on mostly through meetings led by rapporteurs.  Questions
   are generally grouped within Working Parties (WPs) led by a WP
   chairman.  Working Parties report to a parent Study Group led by
   a SG chairman. Work may also be conducted in ITU-T focus groups
   (see 3.5)

2. Introduction

   The telecommunication industry is faced with an explosion in growth
   of the Internet and other IP (Internet Protocol) based networks.
   Operators, manufacturers and software/application providers alike
   are reconsidering their business directions and Standards
   Development Organizations and forums and consortia are facing an
   immense challenge to address this situation.

   This document provides guidelines for communication between the IETF
   and the ITU-T concerning topics of common interest. Early
   identification of these topics will allow for constructive efforts
   between the two organizations.

   The current level of cooperation between the ITU-T and the IETF
   should be built upon to ensure that the competence and experience of
   each organization is brought to bear in the most effective manner
   and in collaboration with the other.  This document provides
   guidelines for collaboration between the ITU-T and the IETF.

Internet-Draft IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines     January 2012


3. Guidance on Collaboration

   This section builds on existing collaborative processes and details
   some of the more important guidance points that each organization
   should be aware of for effective collaboration.

3.1. How to Interact on ITU-T or IETF Work Items

   Study groups that have identified work topics that are IP-
   related should evaluate the relationship with topics defined in
   the IETF. Current IETF Working Groups and their charters (IETF
   definition of the scope of work) are listed in the IETF archives
   (see section 3.5).

   A study group may decide that development of a Recommendation on
   a particular topic may benefit from collaboration with the IETF.
   The study group should identify this collaboration in its work
   plan (specifically in that of each Question involved),
   describing the goal of the collaboration and its expected
   outcome.

   An IETF Working Group should also evaluate and identify areas of
   relationship with the ITU-T and document the collaboration with
   the ITU-T study group in its charter.  The following sections
   outline a process that can be used to enable each group to be
   informed about the other's new work items.

3.1.1. How the ITU-T is informed about Existing IETF Work Items

   The responsibility is on individual study groups to review the
   current IETF Working Groups to determine if there are any topics of
   mutual interest.  Should a study group believe that there is an
   opportunity for collaboration on a topic of mutual interest, it
   should contact both the IETF Working Group Chair and the Area
   Director(s) responsible. This may be accompanied by a formal liaison
   statement (see 3.2.4).

3.1.2. How the ITU-T is informed about proposed new IETF work items

   The IETF maintains a mailing list for the distribution of proposed
   new work items among standards development organizations.  Many such
   items can be identified in proposed Birds of a Feather (BoF)
   sessions, as well as draft charters for working groups.  The IETF
   forwards all such draft charters for all new and revised Working
   Groups and Birds Of a Feather session announcements to the IETF
   NewWork mailing list.  An ITU-T mailing list is subscribed to this
   list. Leadership of study groups may subscribe to this ITU-T mailing
   list, which is maintained by the TSB.  Members of the SG-specific


Trowbridge, et. al     Expires October 19, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines     January 2012


   listname may include the SG chairman, SG vice-chairmen, working
   party chairmen, concerned rapporteurs, other experts designated by
   the SG and the SG Counselor.  This will enable the SGs to monitor
   the new work items for possible overlap or interest to their study
   group.  It is expected that this mailing list will see a few
   messages per month.

   Each SG chairman, or designated representative, may provide comments
   on these charters by responding to the IESG mailing list at
   iesg@ietf.org clearly indicating their ITU-T position and the nature
   of their concern.  Plain-text email is preferred on the IESG mailing
   list.

   It should be noted that the IETF turnaround time for new Working
   Group charters is two weeks.  As a result, the mailing list
   should be consistently monitored.



3.1.3. How the IETF is informed about ITU-T Work Items

   The ITU-T accepts new areas of work through the creation or update
   of Questions.  In addition, the ITU-T work programme is documented
   in the Questions of each study group.  These can be found on the
   ITU-T web site.

   study groups should send updates to the IETF NewWork mailing list as
   new Questions are created, terms of reference for Questions are
   updated, or otherwise when there is reason to believe that a
   particular effort might be of interest to the IETF.  Area Directors
   or WG Chairs should provide comments through liaison statements or
   direct email to the relevant SG chairman in cases of possible
   overlap or interest.

3.2. Representation

   ISOC, including its standards body IETF, is a Sector Member of the
   ITU-T.  As a result, ISOC delegates are therefore afforded the same
   rights as other ITU-T Sector Members (see 3.2.1).  Conversely, ITU-T
   delegates may participate in the work of the IETF as representatives
   of the ITU-T (see 3.2.2).  To promote collaboration it is useful to
   facilitate communication between the organizations as further
   described below.

3.2.1. IETF Recognition at ITU-T

   Experts and representatives from the IETF that are chosen by IETF
   leadership may participate in ITU-T meetings as ISOC delegates. The

Internet-Draft IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines     January 2012


   ISOC focal point will facilitate registration and verification of
   these people, as appropriate.

3.2.2. ITU-T Recognition at ISOC/IETF

   ITU-T study group Chairmen can authorize one or more members to
   attend an IETF meeting as an official ITU-T delegate speaking
   authoritatively on behalf of the activities of the study group (or a
   particular rapporteur group).  The study group chairman sends the
   ITU-T list of delegates by email to the Working Group chair, with a
   copy to the Area Directors, and also to the study group.  Note that,
   according to IETF process, opinions expressed by any such delegate
   are given equal weight with opinions expressed by other working
   group participants.

3.2.3. Communication Contacts

   To foster ongoing communication between the ITU-T and IETF, it is
   important to identify and establish contact points within each
   organization.  Contact points may include:

  1. ITU-T Study Group  and IETF Area Director

     An IETF Area Director is the individual responsible for
     overseeing a major focus of activity with a scope similar to
     that of an ITU-T study group chairman.  These positions are
     both relatively long-term (of several years) and offer the
     stability of contact points between the two organizations for
     a given topic.

  2. ITU-T Rapporteur and IETF Working Group Chair

     An IETF Working Group Chair is an individual who is assigned
     to lead the work on a specific task within one particular Area
     with a scope similar to that of an ITU-T rapporteur.  These
     positions are working positions (of a year or more) that
     typically end when the work on a specific topic ends.
     Collaboration here is very beneficial to ensure the actual
     work gets done.

  3. Other Contact Points

     It may be beneficial to establish additional contact points
     for specific topics of mutual interest.  These contact points
     should be established early in the work effort, and in some
     cases the contact point identified by each organization may be
     the same individual.

Internet-Draft IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines     January 2012


   Note that the current IETF Area Directors and Working Group
   Chairs can be found in the IETF Working Group charters.  The
   current ITU-T study group chairmen and rapporteurs are listed on
   the ITU-T web page.

3.2.4. Communication

   Informal communication between contact points and experts of both
   organizations is encouraged.  However, note that formal
   communication from an ITU-T study group, working party or rapporteur
   group to an associated IETF contact point must be explicitly
   approved and identified as coming from the study group, working
   party or rapporteur group, respectively.  Formal liaison statements
   from the ITU-T to the IETF are transmitted according to the
   procedures described in [2].  These liaison statements are placed by
   the IETF onto a liaison statements web page at
   https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/.  An individual at the IETF is
   assigned responsibility for dealing with each liaison statement that
   is received.  The name and contact information of the responsible
   person and any applicable deadline is listed with the links to the
   liaison statement on this web page.

   Formal liaison statements from the IAB, the IETF, an IETF Working
   Group or or  Area to the ITU-T are generated, approved, and
   transmitted according to the procedures described in [2].  Formal
   communication is intended to allow the sharing of positions between
   the IETF and the ITU-T outside of actual documents (as described in
   3.3).  This covers such things as comments on documents and requests
   for input.

3.2.5. Mailing Lists

   All IETF Working Groups and all ITU-T study group Questions have
   associated mailing lists.

   In the IETF, the mailing list is the primary vehicle for discussion
   and decision-making.  It is recommended that the ITU-T experts
   interested in particular IETF Working Group topics subscribe to and
   participate in these lists.  IETF WG mailing lists are open to all
   subscribers.  The IETF Working Group mailing list subscription and
   archive information are noted in each Working Group's charter.  In
   the ITU-T, the TSB has set up formal mailing lists for Questions,
   Working Parties and other topics within study groups (more detail
   can be found on the ITU website).  These mailing lists are typically
   used for ITU-T correspondence, including technical discussion,
   meeting logistics, reports, etc.  Note that individual subscribers
   to this list must be affiliated with an ITU-T member or associate
   (at this time, there is no blanket inclusion of all IETF


Trowbridge, et. al     Expires October 19, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines     January 2012


   participants as members, however, as a member, the ISOC focal point
   can facilitate access by IETF technical experts, liaison
   representatives, or liaison managers).  Any IETF participant may
   subscribe to ITU-T focus group email lists.

3.3. Document Sharing

   During the course of ITU-T and IETF collaboration it is important to
   share working drafts and documents among the technical working
   groups.  Initially proposed concepts and specifications typically
   can be circulated by email (often just repeating the concept and not
   including the details of the specification) on both the IETF and
   ITU-T mailing lists.  In addition, working texts (or URLs) of draft
   Recommendations, Internet-Drafts or RFCs may also be sent between
   the organizations as described below.

   Internet-Drafts are available on the IETF web site.  The ITU-T can
   make selected ITU-T documents at any stage of development available
   to IETF by attaching them to a formal liaison statement. Although a
   communication can point to a URL where a non-ASCII document (e.g.,
   Word) can be downloaded, attachments in proprietary formats to an
   IETF mailing list are discouraged.  It should also be recognized
   that the official version of all IETF documents are in ASCII.

3.3.1. IETF to ITU-T

   IETF documents (e.g., Internet-Drafts) or URLs of those documents
   are most commonly transmitted to ITU-T study groups as liaison
   statements (see [2]), but exceptionally can be submitted to a study
   group as a Contribution from ISOC.  In order to ensure that the IETF
   has properly authorized this, the IETF Working Group must agree that
   the specific drafts are of mutual interest, that there is a benefit
   in forwarding them to the ITU-T for review, comment and potential
   use and that the document status is accurately represented in the
   cover letter.  Once agreed, the appropriate Area Directors would
   review the Working Group request and give approval.  The rules of
   the IETF Trust are followed in these circumstances[3]. The
   contributions would then be forwarded (with the noted approval) to
   the TSB for circulation as a study group Contribution (see 3.2.4).
   Note that material submitted to the ITU-T as an ISOC contribution is
   governed by ITU-T intellectual property rules for contributions. Any
   such contribution will be made only after receiving necessary
   approval of owners of the work in question. In other circumstances,
   a liaison statement may be appropriate. See RFC5378 and
   Recommendation ITU-T A.1 for more information.

Internet-Draft IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines     January 2012


3.3.2. ITU-T to IETF

   A study group or Working Party may send texts of draft new or
   revised Recommendations, clearly indicating their status, to the
   IETF as contributions in the form of liaison statements or Internet-
   Drafts.  Internet-Drafts are IETF temporary documents that expire
   six months after being published.  The study group or Working Party
   must decide that there is a benefit in forwarding them to the IETF
   for review, comment and potential use.  Terms of reference for
   rapporteur group meetings may authorize rapporteur groups to send
   working documents, in the form of Internet-Drafts, to the IETF.

   If the study group or working party elects to transmit the text as
   an Internet-Draft, the document editor would be instructed to
   prepare the contribution in Internet-Draft format (in ASCII and
   optionally postscript format as per [9]) and upload it via
   https://datatracker.ietf.org/idst/upload.cgi.  Material submitted as
   an Internet-Draft or intended for inclusion in an Internet-Draft or
   RFC is governed by the rules set forth in RFCs 5378, 3979, and 4879.
   [3,4,5] Alternatively, the study group, Working Party or rapporteur
   group could attach the text to a formal liaison statement.

   Both the rapporteur and the Document Editor should be identified as
   contacts in the contribution.  The document should also clearly
   indicate the state of development in a particular ITU-T study group.
   Note that liaison statements and their attachments sent to the IETF
   are made publicly available on the IETF web site.

3.3.3. ITU-T & IETF

   It is envisaged that the processes of 3.3.1 & 3.3.2 will often be
   used simultaneously by both an IETF Working Group and an ITU-T study
   group to collaborate on a topic of mutual interest.

   It is also envisaged that the outcome of the collaboration will be
   the documentation in full by one body and its referencing by the
   other (see section 3.4 for details).  That is, common or joint text
   is discouraged because of the current differences in procedures for
   document approval and revision.  Where complementary work is being
   undertaken in both organizations that will result in Recommendations
   or RFCs, due allowance should be given to the differing
   perspectives, working methods, and procedures of the two
   organizations.  That is, each organization should understand the
   other organization's procedures and strive to respect them in the
   collaboration.

Internet-Draft IETF and ITU-T Collaboration Guidelines     January 2012


3.4. Simple Cross Referencing

   Recommendation ITU-T A.5 describes the process for including
   references to documents of other organizations in ITU-T
   Recommendations.  Information specific to referencing IETF RFCs is
   found at http:// itu.int/dms_pub/itu-
   t/oth/3E/01/T3E010000010001MSWE.doc.

   RFC 2026, specifically section 7.1.1, describes the process for
   referencing other open standards (like ITU-T Recommendations) in
   IETF RFCs.

3.5. Preliminary Work Efforts

   Both ITU-T and IETF provide mechanisms for early discussion of
   potential new work areas prior to the official start of work in a
   study group or creation of an IETF working group.

   Objectives, methods and procedures for the creation and operation of
   ITU-T focus groups are defined in Recommendation ITU-T A.7. Focus
   groups are frequently created in new work areas where the division
   of work across various ITU-T study groups and other standards
   development organizations is not yet clear. IETF participants who
   are not members or associates of ITU-T may participate fully in the
   work of ITU-T focus groups.

   In the IETF, guidance for Birds Of a Feather (BoF) sessions is
   provided in RFC 5434.  Efforts that have not yet reached the working
   group stage may be discussed in BOF sessions. These sessions
   typically gauge interest in pursuing creation of working groups. In
   some cases, these discussions continue on mailing lists.

3.6. Additional Items

3.6.1. IETF Information that may be of use to ITU-T participations

   Information on IETF procedures may be found in the documents in the
   informative references, and URLs below.  Note that RFCs do not
   change after they are published.  Rather they are either obsoleted
   or updated by other RFCs.  Such updates are tracked in the rfc-
   index.txt file.

4. Security Considerations

   Documents that describe cooperation procedures, like this one
   does, have no direct Internet security implications.

5. IANA Considerations

   No new IANA considerations.

6. Acknowledgements

   This document is based on the text from RFCs 2436 and 3356 and
   benefited greatly from discussions during the January 2012 ITU-T
