1.  Introduction

   An integral part of the success and adoption of the Real-Time
   Communications Web (RTC-WEB) will be the interoperability between
   RTC-Web applications running on different browsers or different
   versions of a browser.  As browser features evolve, new codecs are
   deployed, and more advanced features are added, it is critical to
   have a negotiation framework between browsers to facilitate evolution
   of real time communications on the web.  It is also important for
   negotiation in a backwards compatible way with legacy VoIP equipment.
   This specification proposes negotiation and signaling requirements
   for enabling broad interoperability capabilities for RTC-Web client
   applications.

   The negotiation and signaling requirements fit into a series of
   specifications have been created to address RTC-Web codec, NAT
   traversal, security, data transmission and use case requirements.
   More information on the RTC-Web can be found here:

   [TODO put links to supporting drafts here]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Introduction

   This proposal supports an architecture where the negotiations happen
   directly between two browsers (or other RTC-Web client applications)
   or a model where the browser routes the negotiation via a third
   server that helps facilitate the negotiation.  In the first model
   where communications are direct, it is assumed that ICE has already
   been used to set up a communication channel between the browsers that
   can be used for negotiation.

   While SIP is used in this proposal, it is a restricted subset of the
   SIP functionally for initiating and setting up RTP streams and
   rendezvous services for these messages.


4.  Negotiation Requirements

   This section details the secure channel negotiation requirements for
   RTC-Web client applications.  The requirements below originate from

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                  July 2011


   the RTC-Web NAT draft [I-D.cbran-jennings-rtc-web-nat].

4.1.  ICE

   It is plausible that many RTC-WEB client applications, such as web
   browsers will be deployed behind a NAT.  To set up secure data plane
   sessions, and address the security requirements identified in
   Section 8 all RTC-WEB client application implementations are REQUIRED
   to natively expose an implementation of either ICE [RFC5245] or ICE-
   Lite (Section 2.7 of [RFC5245]).  Implicit to implementing ICE, all
   RTC-WEB client applications are REQUIRED to implement Simple
   Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address
   Translators (NATs) (STUN) [RFC3489] and Traversal Using Relays around
   NAT (TURN) [RFC5766].

   Echoing from he RTC-Web NAT draft [I-D.cbran-jennings-rtc-web-nat],
   ICE is REQUIRED be implemented and available natively from the RTC-
   Web client application.  What this means via example is; if the RTC-
   Web client application happens to be a web browser, the web browser
   MUST implement ICE such that adheres to the RTC-Web NAT draft
   [I-D.cbran-jennings-rtc-web-nat].


5.  Signaling Protocol Requirements

   This section covers the signaling protocol to be used by RTC-WEB
   applications.  To ensure interoperability not just between RTC-WEB
   applications, but with legacy PBX phone systems as well, a small
   subset of SIP will be REQUIRED for all RTC-WEB client application
   implementations.  In addition to the subset of SIP specification
   [RFC3261], RTC-WEB client application implementations will be
   REQUIRED to support DNS resolutions as specified in [RFC3263] and the
   offer/answer model with SDP as specified in [RFC3264].

   Because the browsers only need to use a small subset of SIP, the
   specification assumes that a majority of SIP implementations will
   interoperate with the browsers.

5.1.  Client Application SIP Requirements

   This section focuses on the subset of SIP functionality that will
   exist within all RTC-WEB client applications.  The following User
   Agent Client (UAC) subset of the SIP specification [RFC3261] is
   REQUIRED.

   o  General User Agent Behavior - [Section 8]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                  July 2011


   o  Registration - [Section 10]

   o  Client Transaction - [Section 17.1]

   o  Canceling a Request - [Section 9.1]

   o  Terminating a Session - [Section 15.1], [Section 15.1.1]

   o  3.XX Redirect Responses - [Section 8.1.3.4]

   o  TLS - [Section 26.3.1]

   o  Outbound Proxy

5.2.  Client Application Optional SIP Support

   In the SIP specification [RFC3261], the SIP features listed below are
   required for all UAC implementations.  RTC-WEB client applications
   are not a fully featured SIP UAC and will only be implementing a
   subset of the SIP specification.  Thusly, unlike SIP UACs, the
   following list of SIP features is to be considered OPTIONAL for RTC-
   WEB client application implementations.

   o  INVITEs without an offer

   o  re-INVITEs - [Section 14.1]

   o  forking - [Section 19.3]

   o  S/MIME - [Section 23]

   o  SIPS URI Scheme - [Section 26.2.2]

5.3.  Required SIP Methods

   This section outlines the REQUIRED SIP methods for all RTC-WEB client
   applications.

   o  INVITE - [RFC3261] - Section 13

   o  REGISTER - [RFC3261] - Section 10

   o  ACK - [RFC3261] - Section 13.2

   o  CANCEL - [RFC3261] - Section 13.2

   o  BYE - [RFC3261] - Section 13.2

   o  UPDATE - [RFC3311]

5.4.  Multipart SIP Message Requirements

   For handling SIP messages RTC-WEB client applications are required to
   implement the multipart MIME handling scheme as specified in
   [RFC5621].

5.5.  Identity Requirements

   Identity, for the purposes of this section, is defined as a SIP URI.
   There are two areas concerning SIP identity this specification will
   address.

   The first area covers validation of the message originator.  To
   securely validate a the identity of a SIP message originator, all
   RTC-WEB client applications are REQUIRED to implement the mechanism
   specified in [RFC4474].

   To support cases were the identify of a caller/callee may change,
   such as when a call is parked and transferred from the original
   callee to another party, all RTC-WEB client applications are REQUIRED
   to implement the identity mechanism specified in [RFC4916].
   [RFC3261]implicitly REQUIRES the implementation of the UPDATE method
   as specified in [RFC3311]

5.6.  Network Address Traversal

   RTC-WEB client applications MUST support Network Address Translator
   (NAT) traversal.  This section will address SIP-related areas to
   support NAT traversal.

   As called for in the negotiation requirements; RTC-WEB client
   applications will implement STUN.  To support client-managed
   connections, STUN-based keep-alives as specified in [RFC5626] are
   REQUIRED.

   When SIP is used with UDP, responses to requests are returned to the
   source address the request came from, and to the port written into
   the topmost Via header field value of the request.  This behavior is
   not desirable when the RTC-WEB client application is behind a Network
   Address Translator (NAT).  To address UDP traversal problem the
   "rport" extension as specified in [RFC3581] is REQUIRED.


6.  Legacy VoIP Interoperability

   The RTC-Web negotiation requirements specify a discrete subset of the

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                  July 2011


   SIP specification.  The discrete subset was chosen to implicitly
   enable broad interoperability between RTC-Web client applications and
   legacy VoIP systems.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


8.  Security Considerations

   Because there are a number of security issues, considerations and
   requirements for RTC-WEB client applications there is a draft that
   specifically addresses the RTC-WEB application security
   considerations.  This draft defers it's security considerations and
   requirements to the security considerations for RTC-Web draft
   [I-D.ekr-security-considerations-for-rtc-web].
