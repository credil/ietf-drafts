                           CoAP Alive Message
                     draft-castellani-core-alive-00

Abstract

   In the context of a Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE), hosts
   could frequently be energy-constrained and be turned off the vast
   majority of time for energy-saving purposes.

   In the case of a CoAP server, while it is offline, it is neither
   available to serve requests.  Clients desiring to access its
   resources have no way to understand when they will find it up again.

   This specification provides a simple new message that gives to a CoAP
   server the ability to signal its current availability in the network.

Internet-Draft             CoAP Alive Message                 March 2012


1.  Introduction

   In the context of a Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE), hosts
   could frequently be energy-constrained and be turned off the vast
   majority of time for energy-saving purposes.

   In the case of a CoAP server, while it is offline, it is neither
   available to serve requests.  Clients desiring to access its
   resources have no way to understand when they will find it up again.

   This specification provides a simple new message that gives to a CoAP
   server the ability to signal its current availability in the network.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Alive (ALV) Message Type

   This specification defines a new message type for the CoAP message-
   layer (see Section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-core-coap]).  The type of a
   message is specified by the T field of the CoAP header.

   An "Alive" message (ALV) indicates that a CoAP server is up and ready
   to serve requests.  Alive shares T value with the Non-Confirmable
   (NON) message type, but is univocally distinguishable by the fact
   that it MUST be empty.

   When a client receives an ALV message from a server, if it is
   interested in any resource served by it, the client SHOULD try
   sending a request to it since the Alive message provides an
   indication of its current availability.


3.  Examples

   Figure 1 shows a sample use case where a server notifies its wake up
   to clients using multicast.
