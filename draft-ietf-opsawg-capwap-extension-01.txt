1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.11n standard was published in 2009 and it is an amendment to
   the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard to improve network throughput.  The
   maximum data rate increases to 600Mbit/s physical throughput rate.
   In the physical layer, 802.11n use OFDM and MIMO to achieve the high
   throughput. 802.11n use multiple antennas to form antenna array which
   can be dynamically adjusted to improve the signal strength and extend
   the coverage.

   There are couple of capabilities of 802.11n need to be supported by
   CAPWAP control message such as radio capability, radio configuration
   and station information.

   [IEEE-802.11.2009] standard was published in 2009 and it is an
   amendment of the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard to improve throughput.
   The maximum data rate increases to 600Mbit/s physical throughput
   rate.  In the physical layer, 802.11n use OFDM and MIMO to achieve
   the high throughput. 802.11n use multiple antennas to form antenna
   array which can be dynamically adjusted to improve the signal
   strength and extend the coverage.

   802.11n support three modes of channel usage: 20MHz mode, 40MHz mode
   and mixed mode.802.11n has a new feature called channel binding.  It
   can bind two adjacent 20MHz channel to one 40MHz channel to improve
   the throughput.If using 40MHz channel configuration there will be
   only one non-overlapping channel in 2.4GHz.  In the large scale
   deployment scenario, operator need to use 20MHz channel configuration
   in 2.4GHz to allow more non-overlapping channels.

   In MAC layer, a new feature of 802.11n is Short Guard Interval(GI).
   802.11a/g use 800ns guard interval between the adjacent information
   symbols.  In 802.11n, the GI can be configured to 400nm under good
   wireless condition.

   Another feature in 802.11 MAC layer is Block ACK. 802.11n can use one
   ACK frame to acknowledge several MPDU receiving event.

   CAPWAP need to be extended to support the above new 802.11n features.
   For example, CAPWAP should allow the access controller to know the
   supported 802.11n features and the access controller should be able
   to configure the different channel binding modes.  This document
   defines extension of the CAPWAP 802.11 binding to support 802.11n
   features.

4.  CAPWAP extension for 802.11n support

   There are three 802.11n features need to be supported by CAPWAP
   802.11 binding: 802.11n radio capability, 802.11n radio configuration
   and station information.  This section defines the extension of
   current CAPWAP 802.11 binding to support 802.11n features.

4.1.  802.11n Radio Capability Message Element

   [RFC5416] defines IEEE 802.11 binding for CAPWAP protocol.  It
   defines IEEE 802.11 Information Element which is used to communicate
   any IE defined in IEEE 802.11 protocol.  This document defines
   802.11n radio capability information element which is composed of the
   IEEE 802.11 Information Element header that defined in section 6.6 of
   [RFC5416] and the IEEE 802.11 HT information element that defined in
   section 8.4.2.58 of [IEEE-802.11.2012].  The HT IE is carried by the
   IEEE 802.11 information element that defined in section 6.6 of

5.  Power and Channel auto reconfiguration

   Power and channel auto reconfiguration could avoid potential radio
   interference and improve the WLAN performance.  In general, the auto-
   configuration of radio power and channel could occur at two stages:
   when the WTP power on or during the WTP running time.

   When the WTP is power-on, it is of necessity to configure a proper
   channel to the WTP in order to achieve best status of radio links.
   IEEE 802.11 Direct Sequence Control elements or IEEE 802.11 OFDM
   Control element defined in RFC5416 should be carried to offer WTP a
   channel at this stage.  Those element should be carried in the
   Configure Status Response message.  If those information element is
   zero, the WTP will determine its channel by itself, otherwise the WTP
   should be configured according to the provided information element.

   When the WTP determines its own channel configuration, it should
   first scan the channel information, then determine which channel it
   will work on and form a channel quality scan report.  The channel
   quality report will be sent to the AC using WTP Event Request message
   by the WTP.  The AC can use IEEE 802.11 Direct Sequence Control or
   IEEE 802.11 OFDM Control information element carried by the configure
   Update Request message to configure a new channel for the WTP.

   IEEE 802.11 Tx Power information element is used by the AC to control
   the transmission power of the WTP.  The 802.11 Tx Power information
   element is carried in the Configure Status Response message during
   the power on phase or in the Configure Update Request message during
   the running phase.

   Figure 6: Channel Information Format

   Channel ID: the channel ID of the channel which will be scanned.

   Flag: Bitmap, reserved for future use.

   The channel scan procedure:

   The WTP has two work mode: the first one is normal mode.  In this
   mode, the WTP can provide service for the STA access and scan the
   channel at the same time.  Whether the WTP will scan the channel is
   determined by the Max Cycles segment in the Channel Bind TLV.  When
   this segment is set to 0, the WTP will not scan the channle.  If this
   segment is set to 255, the WTP will continuous scan the channel.  The
   type of the scan is determined by the Scan Type segment.  In the
   passive scan type, the WTP monitor the air interface, based on the
   received beacon frame to determine the nearby WTPs.  In the active
   scan type, the WTP will send probe message and receive the probe
   response message.  In the normal scan mode, the WTP will use 3
   parameters: PrimeChlSrvTime, OnChannelScanTIme, OffChannelScnTIme.
   The WTP will provide access service for the STAs for PrimeChlSrvTime
   duration and then start to scan the channel for On Channel ScnTime
   duration.  Back to the working channel, provide STA access service
   for PrimeChlSrvTime, then leave the working channel, start to scan
   the next channel for Off Channel ScanTime duration.  This process
   will be repeated until all the channel is scanned.

   When the WTP work in the scan only mode, there is no difference
   between the working channel and scan channel.  Every channel's scan
   duration will be OffChannelScnTime and the PrimeChlSrvTime and
