Internet-Draft     An IETF URN Sub-Namespace for OAuth         June 2012


1.  Introduction

   Various extensions and companion specifications to The OAuth 2.0
   Authorization Framework [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] utilize URIs to identify
   the extension in use or other relevant context.  This document
   creates and registers an IETF URN Sub-namespace, as documented in RFC
   3553 [RFC3553], for use with such specifications.  The new 'oauth'
   sub-namespace is urn:ietf:params:oauth and OAuth relevant parameters
   will be established underneath it.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Registration Template

   If a registrant wishes to have a OAuth URI registered, then a URN of
   the form urn:ietf:params:oauth:<class>:<id> will be requested where
   <class> is the category of the functionality being registered and
   <id> is a unique id for the functionality within that class.

   The registration procedure for new entries requires a request in the
   form of the following template and is subject to Expert Review per
   RFC 5226 [RFC5226].

   URN:
      The URI that identifies the registered functionality.

   Common Name:
      The name by which the functionality being registered is generally
      known.

   Change Controller:  For standards-track RFCs, state "IETF".  For
      others, give the name of the responsible party.  Other details
      (e.g., postal address, e-mail address, home page URI) may also be
      included.

   Specification Document(s):  Reference to the document that specifies
      the URI, preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a
      copy of the document.  An indication of the relevant sections may
      also be included, but is not required.

   The registration request for the urn:ietf:params:oauth URN Sub-
   namespace is found in the IANA Considerations (Section 5) section of

   this document.

3.1.  Example Registration Request

   The following is an example registration request for a URI underneath
   the urn:ietf:params:oauth sub-namespece.  The requested URI
   represents a new OAuth 2.0 grant type.

   This is a request to IANA to please register the value
   "grant-type:example" in the registry urn:ietf:params:oauth
   established in An IETF URN Sub-Namespace for OAuth.

   o  URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:example

   o  Common Name: An Example Grant Type for OAuth 2.0

   o  Change controller: IETF

   o  Specification Document: [[the document URI]]


4.  Security Considerations

   None not already inherent to using URNs.  Security considerations for
   URNs in general can be found in RFC 2141 [RFC2141].

   Any work that is related to OAuth would benefit from familiarity with
   the security considerations of The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes two requests of IANA:

   o  Registration of a new IANA URN sub-namespace,
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:, per RFC 3553 [RFC3553].  The registration
      request can be found in Section 5.1 below.

   o  Establishment of a new registry for URNs subordinate to
      urn:ietf:params:oauth.  Instructions for a registrant to request
      the registration of such a URN are in Section 3.

5.1.  IETF URN Sub-namespace Registration urn:ietf:params:oauth

   Per RFC 3553 [RFC3553], IANA is requested to please register a new
   URN sub-namespace, urn:ietf:params:oauth.

   o  Registry name: oauth

   o  Specification: [[this document]]

   o  Repository: [[not sure about this? this document or
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth]]

   o  Index value: values subordinate to urn:ietf:params:oauth are of
      the from urn:ietf:params:oauth:<class>:<id> with <class>:<id> as
      the index value.

      draft-ietf-oauth-urn-sub-ns-02" at
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/msg09350.html
      and subsequent messages in that thread

   o  Update area and workgroup (now Security and OAuth was Internet and
      nothing)

   o  Requesting new URNs now more lightweight by changing from 'RFC
      Required' to 'Expert Review' (RFC5226)

   o  Rework much of the document to be more clear about it registering
      the urn:ietf:params:oauth URN sub-namespace and separately how
      other documents are to request URNs under that sub-namespace.

   o  Removed everything about asking the IANA to generate any part of
      the URN.

   o  Added an Example Registration Request

   o  Added reference to OAuth security considerations in security
      considerations.

   o  Added Acknowledgements

   draft-ietf-oauth-urn-sub-ns-02

   o  fix typo: "The registration procedure for new entries to the
      requires a request ..." --> "The registration procedure for new
      entries requires a request ..."

   draft-ietf-oauth-urn-sub-ns-01

   o  security considerations now points to RFC 2141 rather than RFC
      3553 per
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/msg07880.html
