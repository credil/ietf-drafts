      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing multi-domain (Area or AS) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switch Path (LSP).</t>
      <t>In this circumstance, it is highly desirable to be able to dynamically and automatically discover a set of Boundary Nodes (BN) along with their domain information in a simple way. For that purpose, this document defines extensions to the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol for the advertisement of Boundary Node (BN) Discovery information within an OSPF area or within the entire OSPF routing domain.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>This document defines extensions to OSPFv2 <xref target="RFC2328"/> and OSPFv3 <xref target="RFC5340"/> to allow a boundary node in an OSPF routing domain to advertise its location, along with domain information.</t>
      <t>Generic capability advertisement mechanisms for OSPF are defined in <xref target="RFC4970"/>.  These allow a router to advertise its capabilities within an OSPF area or an entire OSPF routing domain.  This document leverages this generic capability advertisement mechanism to fully satisfy the dynamic BN discovery.</t> 
      <t>This document defines a new TLV (named the Boundary Node Discovery TLV (BND TLV)) to be carried within the OSPF Router Information LSA (<xref target="RFC4970"/>).</t>
      <t>The Boundary Node information advertised is detailed in <xref target="SEC_OVERVIEW"/>.  Protocol extensions and procedures are defined in <xref target="SEC_BND"/> and <xref target="SEC_PROC"/>.</t>
      <t>A detailed description about the need for auto discovery of Boundary Nodes (BN) and thier domains is also provided in this document.</t>
      <t>The OSPF extensions defined in this document allow for Boundary Node discovery within an OSPF routing domain.  Boundary Node can be an Area Border Router (ABR) or Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR). </t>

    <section title="Applications" toc="default">
      <t>Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) procedure as defined in <xref target="RFC5441"/>, requires Path Computation Element (PCE) <xref target="RFC4655"/> to be aware of the Boundary Nodes (BN) for the inter-domain path computation. This information would be either statically configured at PCE or learned via some mechanism, as listed in <xref target="SEC_OTHER"/>. </t>
      <t>In case of static configuration, as shown in the <xref target="fig1"/>, incase of OSPF Area0, configuration of BNs at PCE5 is extensive. BRPC procedure guarantees a best path only if BNs are selected correctly, any change in BNs at run time may lead to sub-optimal path. Also Administrator need to configure ABR / ASBR ID in such a way that it is reachable from all the domains, BND TLV can take care of this automatically.</t>

    <section title="Static Configurations" toc="default" >
      <t>A simple solution would be to configure BNs (ABR and ASBR) at PCE(s) along with their domain information. As this information is fairly static this could work in simple situations. But as PCE are being used in bigger and multiple domains, any sort of static configurations would put extra effort on the system administrator. Selection of correct BNs is the core of any inter-domain path computation procedure, this information should be dynamically learned and maintained. </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Importance of Domain Information along with BNs" toc="default" anchor="SEC_DOMAIN">
      <t>There are methods to learn BNs dynamically from IGP, but the knowledge of neighboring-domains is not possible to obtain. Without this the correct BN based on the domain-path can not be selected. <xref target="RFC5441"/> mentions:</t>
      <t>"Note that PCE(i) only considers the entry BNs of domain(i), i.e., only the BNs that provide connectivity from domain(i-1).  In other words, the set BN-en(k,i) is only made of those BNs that provide connectivity from domain (i-1) to domain(i)."</t>
      <t>This selection of correct BNs providing connectivity between correct domains cannot be made by the information obtained from IGP. Without the correct selection we would not be following <xref target="RFC5441"/>. </t>

    <section title="Elements of Procedure" toc="default"  anchor="SEC_PROC">
      <t>The BND TLV is advertised within OSPFv2 Router Information LSAs (Opaque type of 4 and Opaque ID of 0) or OSPFv3 Router Information LSAs (function code of 12), which are defined in <xref target="RFC4970"/>.  As such, elements of procedure are inherited from those defined in <xref target="RFC4970"/>.</t>
      <t>In OSPFv2, the flooding scope is controlled by the opaque LSA type(as defined in <xref target="RFC5250"/>) and in OSPFv3, by the S1/S2 bits (as defined in <xref target="RFC5340"/>).  If the flooding scope is area local, then the BND TLV MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 type 10 router information LSA or an OSPFV3 Router Information LSA with the S1 bit set and the S2 bit clear.  If the flooding scope is the entire IGP domain, then the BND TLV MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 type 11 Router Information LSA or OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the S1 bit clear and the S2 bit set.</t>
      <t>When the BN function is deactivated, the OSPF speaker MUST originate a new Router Information LSA that no longer includes the corresponding BND TLV, provided there are other TLVs in the LSA.  If there are no other TLVs in the LSA, it MUST either send an empty Router Information LSA or purge it by prematurely aging it.</t>
      <t>The BN address (i.e., the address indicated within the BN-ADDRESS sub-TLV) SHOULD be reachable via some prefixes advertised by OSPF.</t>
      <t>The BND TLV information regarding a specific BN is only considered current and useable when the router advertising this information is itself reachable via OSPF calculated paths in the same area of the LSA in which the BND TLV appears.</t>
      <t>A change in the state of a BN (activate, deactivate, domain change) MUST result in a corresponding change in the BND TLV information advertised by an OSPF router (inserted, removed, updated)in its LSA.  The way BNs determine the information they advertise, and how that information is made available to OSPF, is out of the scope of this document.  Some information may be configured and other information may be automatically determined by the OSPF.</t>
      <t>A change in information in the BND TLV MUST NOT trigger any SPF computation at a receiving router.</t>

    <section title="Backward Compatibility" toc="default">
      <t>The BND TLV defined in this document does not introduce any interoperability issues.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Impact on Network" toc="default">
      <t>The routers acting as BNs will originate Opaque LSA with BND Tlv; As there are only few BNs exist in the network, the performance impact in flooding is very less. </t>
