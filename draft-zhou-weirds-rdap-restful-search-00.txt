Internet-Draft             RDAP RESTful search                  Feb 2013


1.  Introduction

   A searchable RDAP service is a HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
   based function which supports multiple searching parameters and
   boolean search capabilities.  This document describes the
   specifications for searching parameters, searching response formats,
   boolean search function and some security consideration about RDAP
   searchability.

   First the RESTful query URI formats for searching specific
   information are defined.  There are 5 basic searching types and some
   extended searching parameters that may be used according to the New
   gTLD Applicant Guide Book.  The basic searching types, including
   search of IP, AS (Autonomous System) number, domain, name server and
   entity, that are consistent with the query types defined in
   draft-ietf-weirds-rdap-query [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].

   The second section of this document describes the boolean search
   function that supports a set of search criteria like AND, OR, NOT.

   The third part of this document gives some response data format
   specified in JSON and proposes some consideration on ordering and
   paging.

   Finally, this document talks about some security issues that should
   be considerated to avoid abuses of this searchability feature.


2.  Searching Parameters

   In this section, basic and extended searching parameters are mainly
   presented.  The combination of following parameters can also be used
   as searching parameters.

2.1.  Basic Search

   Basic search means 5 types of searching parameters which includes IP,
   AS number, domain, name server and entity.

2.1.1.  IP Search

   Syntax: /search/?ip=<IP address> or ip/?address=<CIDR format>

   IP search parameter is either an IPv4 RFC 1166 [RFC1166] or IPv6 RFC
   5952 [RFC5952] address (i.e.  XXX) or an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR RFC 4632
   [RFC4632] notation address block (i.e.  XXX/YY).

   This is an example URL for the most specific network containing

Internet-Draft             RDAP RESTful search                  Feb 2013


   192.0.2.0:

   /search/?ip=192.0.2.0

   This is an example URL for the most specific network containing
   192.0.2.0/24:

   /search/?ip=192.0.2.0%2f24

2.1.2.  AS Number Search

   Syntax: /search/?as=<autonomous system number>

   Searches for information regarding autonomous system number
   registrations are of the form /autnum/?as=XXX where XXX is an
   autonomous system number RFC 5396 [RFC5396].

   The following is an example URL for the AS number search.

   /search/?as=65551

2.1.3.  Domain Search

   Syntax: /search/?domain=<domain names>

   Searches for domain information are of the form /?domain=XXXX, where
   XXXX is a fully-qualified domain name RFC 4343 [RFC4343] in either
   the in-addr.arpa or ip6.arpa zones (for Regional Internet Registries
   (RIRs)) or a fully-qualified domain name in a zone administered by
   the server operator (for Domain Name Registries (DNRs)).

   The example URL for searching domain name like example.com is defined
   below.

   /search/?domain=example.com

2.1.4.  Name Server Search

   Syntax: /search/?ns=<name server names>

   This parameter represents a fully qualified name as specified in RFC
   952 [RFC0952] and RFC 1123 [RFC1123].  Internationalized names
   represented in A-label format RFC 5890 [RFC5890] are also valid name
   server names.

   This is an example URL for the specific name server searching
   cotaining ns.example.com.

Internet-Draft             RDAP RESTful search                  Feb 2013


   /search/?ns=ns.example.com

2.1.5.  Entity Search

   Syntax: /search/?entityID=<Entity Handle>

   This parameter represents an entity (such as a contact, registrant,
   or registrar) identifier.

   The example URL for searching entity handle such as CID0193 is
   defined below.

   /search/?entityID=CID0193

2.2.  Extended Search

   This seachable function defined in New gTLD Applicant Guide Book
   should offer partial or exact match capabilities on some fields, such
   as contact name, city, street, postal code etc..  So besides the
   basic search parameters, other extended search parameters are also
   specified.

   Syntax: /search/?keyword=<value>

   Followings are some search examples that this functionality that
   would support.

   1.  The "entityname" field represents the names of a specified
       contact, registrant or registrar.  This an example URL for the
       entity names search: /search/?entityname=James%20Blunt

   2.  The "street" parameter contains the entity's street address
       defined in RFC 5733 [RFC5733].  A street search example: /search/
       ?street=123%20Example%20Dr

   3.  The "city" parameter contains the entity's city defined in RFC
       5733 [RFC5733].  A city search example: /search/?city=Beijing

   4.  The "sp" parameter contains the entity's state or province
       defined in RFC 5733 [RFC5733].  A state or province search
       example: /search/?sp=VA

   5.  The "pc" parameter contains the entity's postal code defined in
       RFC 5733 [RFC5733].  A postal code search example: /search/
       ?pc=100190

   6.  The "cc" parameter contains the entity's country code defined in
       RFC 5733 [RFC5733].  A country code search example: /search/

       ?cc=CN


3.  Boolean Search

   RIRs and DNRs shall offer Boolean search capabilities supporting, at
   least, the following logical operators to join a set of search
   criteria: AND, OR, NOT.

   Any fields described above can be combined together by the boolean
   criteria to be the search input parameters.  Partial-match and exact-
   match capabilities would also be offered by RIRs and DNRs. "*" is the
   replace mark for partial-match function. "&" mark represents AND, "+"
   mark means OR and "-" mark means that none of the input text is
   inlcuded in the response results.

   An example is given below searching for entity name called James ***
   or Tom ***, registered domain name is xyz.com and country code is not
   CN.

   /search/?entityname=James*+Tom*&domain=xyz.com&cc=-CN


4.  Search Response Format

   The search results will be returned in a JSON object, the format of
   which is discussed in the section 5 of
   draft-hollenbeck-weirds-rdap-search
   [I-D.hollenbeck-weirds-rdap-search].  Ordering and paging are taken
   into consideration in this document.  Three JSON objects, which are
   "page", "total" and "orderby" are defined as below.

   The server could specifiy the number of display results per page
   according to different registries' requirements.  The search response
   will include the page number and total page number information in the
   results. "orderby" is the field using for ordering all the results.

           {
             "results" :
             [
               {
                 "handle" : "1-XXXX",
                 "name" : "1.example.com",
                 "objectClass" : "domain",
                 ...
                 "page" : "1",
                 "total" : "10",
                 "orderby" : "domain"
               },
               {
                 "handle" : "2-XXXX",
                 "name" : "2.example.com",
                 "objectClass" : "domain",
                 ...
                 "page" : "1",
                 "total" : "10",
                 "orderby" : "domain"
               }
             ]
           }


   This response format is a preliminary design for future disscussion.
   If the idea is adopted by the working group, the search URI including
   paging and ordering information should also be specified, such as
   /search/?domain=example.com&page=1&orderby=domain.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not specify any IANA actions.


6.  Security considerations

   The service shall include appropriate precautions to avoid abuse of
   this feature.

   A registrar or registrant may only login the searchable Whois system
   using their own ID and password, and may only search information
   related to their own domain names.

   If a registrar, registrant or a third-party user wants to search
   others' information, they need to explain the reasonable purposes,
   commit to protect privacy and security, and sign an agreement at
