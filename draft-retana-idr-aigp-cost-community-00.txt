1.  Introduction

   The Accumulated IGP Metric (AIGP) Attribute [I-D.ietf-idr-aigp] has
   been defined with the purpose of carrying an AIGP.  The attribute is
   used in the BGP selection process before the tie braking procedures
   [RFC4271], effectively after the LOCAL_PREF comparison.

   The Cost Community [I-D.ietf-idr-custom-decision] can provide a
   flexible mechanism to carry the AIGP.  It can se used both at a
   different point in the selection process, or as a direct replacement
   for the AIGP attribute in networks that don't fully support it.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Use of the Cost Community to carry the AIGP

   The applicability and procedures defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-aigp] for
   originating and modifying the AIGP value are not changed in this
   document.  The value is used as the Cost of the Cost Community.

   The Point of Insertion (POI) can be set to any of the values defined
   in [I-D.ietf-idr-custom-decision].  Note that the use of the
   LOCAL_PREF POI is equivalent to using the AIGP Attribute in routers
   that don't support it.

   If the Cost Community is used to carry the AIGP velue, then the AIGP
   Attribute SHOULD NOT be used.  If used, then the high-order bit of
   the Community-ID MUST be set in a Cost Community with a POI of AIGP
   to avoid an inconsistent selection process.  Note that this operation
   doesn't preclude using a Cost Community with a Cost of the AIGP at a
   different POI.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document explains the use of the Cost Community to provide
   flexibility in the application of routing policy related to the
   accumulated IGP metric of a route.  As such, it does not introduce
   new security risks than the ones considered in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-custom-decision] or [I-D.ietf-idr-aigp].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
