    <abstract>
      <t>During the past 4 years, Path Computation Element (PCE) WG has
      produced a set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path
      Computation Element as a tool to help MPLS-TE LSP tunnels placement. In
      the PCE architecture, a main assumption has been done concerning the
      information that the PCE needs to perform its computation: the Traffic
      Engineering Database (TED) contains all pertinent and suitable
      information regarding the networks that is in the scope of a PCE.
      Nevertheless, requirements and inventory of TED information have not
      been formalized. In addition, some recent RFC (like BRPC RFC 5441) or WG
      draft (like draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy ...) suffer from a lack of
      information coming from the TED resulting to a non optimal result or
      some difficulties to deploy them. This memo tries to identity all TED
      requirements for the PCE as well as provides some helps to operators to
      fulfill the PCE TED.</t>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t>Looking to the different RFCs that describe the PCE architecture and
      in particular <xref target="RFC4655">RFC 4655</xref>, <xref
      target="RFC5440">RFC 5440</xref> and <xref target="RFC5441"> RFC
      5441</xref> as well as the draft <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-hierarchy-fwk">H-PCE</xref>, the Path Computation
      Element (PCE) need to acquire a set of information that are usually
      store in the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) in order to perform its
      path computation. Even if intra-domain topology acquisition is well
      documented and known (e.g. by listen to the IGP-TE protocol that runs
      inside the network), inter-domain topology information, PCE peer
      address, neighbor AS ... that are necessary for the Backward Recursive
      Path Computation (BRPC) and the Hierarchical PCE are not documented and
      not well standardized.</t>

      <t>The purpose of this memo is to inventory the required information
      that should be part of the PCE TED and the different mechanism that
      allow an operator to fulfill it.</t>

      <section title="PCE assumption and hypothesis">
        <t>In some cases both functions (path computation and TED management)
        are slightly coupled: border node identification, endpoint
        localization and topology aggregation for domain sequence
        selection,... to name a few in which an IGP-based TED may not be
        sufficient. It is also important to differentiate several environments
        with different requirements for the multidomain problem. The PCE is
        scoped for any kind of network, from transport networks (TDM/WDM) with
        a rather limited number of domains, few interconnections, and few
        confidentiality issues, transport networks with a large number of
        domains, MPLS networks with several administrative domains, and big
        IP/MPLS networks with a large number of domains with peering
        agreements. For each of them, a different solution for the
        multi-domain path computation may apply. A solution may not be
        scalable for one, but perfect for another.</t>

        <t>Up to now, PCE WG has based its work and standard on the assumption
        and hypothesis that the TED contains all pertinent information
        suitable for the PCE to compute an optimal MPLS-TE LSP placement over
        the networks the PCE controls or a set of domains through BRPC
        algorithm. We could identify two major sources of information for the
        TED:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The intra-domain routing protocol like OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE</t>

            <t>The inter-domain routing protocol i.e. BGP</t>
          </list>If the first source gives a precise and synchronize view of
        the controlled network, BGP just provides network reachability with
        only one AS path (unless using recent add path option). Nevertheless,
        to optimize inter-domain path computation, like BRPC, route diversity
        and a minimum set of Traffic Engineering information about the foreign
        domains could be helpful.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>ABR: Area Border Routers. Routers used to connect two IGP areas
        (areas in OSPF or levels in IS-IS).</t>

        <t>ASBR: Autonomous System Border Router. Router used to connect
        together ASes of the same or different service providers via one or
        more inter-AS links.</t>

        <t>AS: Autonomous System</t>

        <t>Boundary Node (BN): a boundary node is either an ABR in the context
        of inter-area Traffic Engineering or an ASBR in the context of
        inter-AS Traffic Engineering.</t>

        <t>Domain: an Autonomous System</t>

        <t>Entry BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n-1) to domain(n)
        along a determined sequence of domains.</t>

        <t>Exit BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n) to domain(n+1)
        along a determined sequence of domains.</t>

        <t>Inter-area TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an IGP area boundary.</t>

        <t>Inter-AS TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an AS boundary.</t>

        <t>IGP-TE: Interior Gateway Protocol with Traffic Engineering support.
        Both OSPF-TE and IS-IS-TE are indentify in this category.</t>

      <t>This section aims to provide Best Current Practices when mechanisms

      <section title="MPLS layer">
        <t/>

        <section title="Intra-domain">
          <t>As the TED mainly contains the intra-domain topology graph, it is
          RECOMMENDED to link the PCE with the underlying IGP-TE (OSPF-TE or
          IS-IS-TE routing protocol). By configuring the PCE as a source sink
          only, it is possible to listen to the routing protocol and then
          acquired the complete topology graph. In addition, the TED will
          synchronize as fast as the routing protocol converges like any
          router in the domain.</t>

          <t>In addition, management tools like network vendors management
          system SHOULD be used to complement the topology graph provided by
          the routing protocol.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="inter-domain">
          <t>First of all, RFC 5316 and RFC 5392 MUST be activated in the
          IGP-TE (respectively in IS-IS-TE and OSPF-TE) in order to collect TE
          information on the inter-domain links. This give the advantage for
          the PCE to determine what could be feasible, during path
          computation, on the peering links.</t>

          <t>AS path and network reachability are of course obtain from the
          BGP and routing tables. But, it is not possible to collect neither
          route diversity nor TE information on foreign domain.</t>

          <t>So, the main part of the inter-domain topology, like route
          diversity and TE information (i.e. transit delay, packet loss ratio,
          transit jitter ...) on a foreign domain could not be obtain easely.
          Right now, we have identified several know methods to fulfill the
          TED with these kind of information:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Use the <xref target="I-D.gredler-idr-ls-distribution">north
              bound distribution of Link-State and TE Information using
              BGP</xref> proposal to exchange TE information about the foreign
              domain,</t>

              <t>Use PCNtf message to convey, inside vendor attribute (but in
              a non standardize way), TE information of foreign domain between
              PCE,</t>

              <t>Use management system,</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>As well as some potential new mechanisms that needs some
          standardization effort:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>A hierarchical IGP-TE that could help to convey at the AS
              level TE information on an abstract / aggregate view of the
              foreign AS topology,</t>

              <t>Extend PCEP, and in particular PCNtf message to convey such
              TE information on the foreign</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Optical layer">
        <t>To be provided latter.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operational information">
        <t>Most of the time operationals information are provided through the
        management system of the operator. But some could be automatically
        discovered. In particular, in intra-domain, PCE could discover
        automatically its peer through the deployment of RFC</t>

      <t>Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
      RFC.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Acquisition of information for the PCE TED is of course sensible from
      a security point of view, especially when acquiring information from
      others AS. This section aims at providing best practices to prevent some
      security threat when the PCE try to acquire TED information.</t>

      <section title="Intra-domain information">
        <t>Same security considerations must be applied to the PCE when it is
        connected to an IGP-TE protocol as the routing protocol itself. Best
        practices observed and deployed by operators must also be taken into
        account when installing a PCE. In fact, the PCE itself, when deployed
        as a standalone server, must be considered as a standard router
        regarding the IGP-TE. So, disregarding OSPF or IS-IS, same security
        rules must be app lied e.g. login/passwd to protect the
        connectivity.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Inter-domain information">
        <t>Inter-domain relation and so information exchange are subject to
        high potential hijack and so need attention from the security point of
        view. To avoid disclosing or expose confidential information that two
        operators would exchange to fulfil the TED of their respective PCE,
        the relation SHOULD be protected by standard cryptography mechanism.
        E.g. using IPsec tunnel is RECOMMENDED to protect the connectivity
        between PCE and TED exchange.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operational information">
        <t>All operational information like PCE peer addresses are generaly
        added manually to the TED and so don't need any particular protection
        nor subject to security. But, as these based information are needed to
        let PCE connected to its peers, is could potentially contains
        sensitive parameters like login and password. So, standard Best
        Practices are RECOMMENEDED to avoid basic security exposition.</t>
