Internet-Draft         Experience from MAP Testing          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   In recent years, many researchers focus on the IPv6-only network.

   Users or applications in IPv6-only environment may meet with
   difficulties when visiting IPv4 resources, e.g. big data visiting or
   migration.

   From May 2012, CNIC (Computer Network Information Center) in Chinese
   Academy of Sciences performed a series of experiments on the
   comparison with native IPv6 and single translation using NAT64/DNS64
   [RFC6144][RFC6145][RFC6146].

   Although many applications work correctly, there are problems that
   single translation cannot solve, these problems are also mentioned in
   IETF's IPv6-only experiences [RFC6586] and
   [I-D.draft-hazeyama-widecamp-ipv6-only-experience]:

   Several OSes and devices do not work in IPv6-only network; access
   difficulties happen when IPv4 address literal is embedded in the
   application; ALG problem, e.g.  FTP; etc.

   Double translation or encapsulation can solve the problems we have
   when single translation is used.

   This document presents our experience from the network experiment
   using double translation and encapsulation named Mapping of Address
   and Port (MAP).  Common applications are tested in MAP-T, MAP-E, and
   mixed MAP-T/MAP-E modes.

   We refer to the IETF's MAP-T testing results
   [I-D.draft-cordeiro-softwire-experience-mapt], we add some
   applications test with Chinese applications, and try to clarify new
   issues on the relationships among native IPv6, single translation,
   double translation, and encapsulation in the environment.

   Subjectively, we didn't find significant differences when using
   applications in MAP-T, and MAP-E mode.  MAP-T can support IPv6-only
   server.


2.  Technology and Terminology

   In this document, the following terms are used.

   "MAP-T" refers to MAP double stateless translation based solution for
   providing IPv4 hosts connectivity to and across an IPv6 domain, as
   defined by [I-D.draft-ietf-softwire-map-t].

Internet-Draft         Experience from MAP Testing          October 2012


   "MAP-E" refers to MAP Encapsulation based solution with an automatic
   tunneling mechanism for providing IPv4 connectivity service to end
   users over service provider's IPv6 network, as defined by
   [I-D.draft-ietf-softwire-map].

                                 Figure 1

   The MAP core and MAP CPE support both MAP-T and MAP-E modes, running
   Fedora 11 and MAP-T 2.2c and MAP-E 2.2c software developed by CERNET
   (http://mapt.ivi2.org:8039/mapt.html).

   We use three host machines in the experiment, Host 1 and Host 2 are
   IPv4-only PC with Windows 7 and Linux Ubuntu 12.04, Host 3 is IPv6-
   only PC with Windows 7.

   Net 1 is an IPv4 network with public valid IPv4 address, Net 2 is an
   IPv6 network with public valid IPv6 address.  Both Net 1 and Net 2
   are supported by CSTNET.

   The configuration of MAP-T/MAP-E core, MAP-T/MAP-E CPE is shown in
   Appendix part.  DHCP function is not used in this experiment.

   Besides the applications tested in
   [draft-cordeiro-softwire-experience-mapt], we add applications with
   Chinese characteristics, like Baidu.com, Yahoo.com.cn (IPv4 website);
   video stream series; PPTV (IPTV), QQ (Instant Messaging), 360
   (Antivirus).

   In Web test, we separate IPv4/IPv6 website and IPv4 website for
   checking whether A or AAAA record is received.

   In video-stream test, we separate Address-based indexing and Domain
   name-based indexing.  Since in former single translation (NAT64)
   test, only Domain name-based indexing video-stream works well,
   problem occurs when visiting video-stream with IPv4 address literals
   indexing.

   Security test, like Firewall, IPSEC, VPN are not tested in this
   experiment.

   Applications with IPv4 address literals, like HTTP, SSH, VNC are not
   tested in this experiment.


4.  General Experiences

   For MAP-T and MAP-E test, subjectively we didn't find significant
   differences compared to native IPv4 environment using Windows 7 and
   Ubuntu 12.04:

   In Internet Applications (Normal) test, the browsers and online game
   works correctly;

   In Internet Applications (C/S) test, we visited the website, e-mail,
   video stream without problems, only IPv4 resources are visited;

   In Internet Applications (P2P) test, we also had good experience with
   file distribution, VOIP, IPTV, and instant messaging;

   In security application, the antivirus software works correctly and
   can be updated.

   For mixed MAP-T/MAP-E test, since the forwarding mode is only
   required in the IPv4 to IPv6 direction, and it can be automatically
   identified by checking the value of the next header in IPv6 packets
   in the IPv6 to IPv4 direction.  In the test, we first set MAP core
   with MAP-T mode and CPE with MAP-E mode; then set MAP core with MAP-E
   mode and CPE with MAP-T mode.  The applications also work correctly.


5.  Discussion of relationships among native IPv6, single translation,
    double translation and encapsulation

   For the new users, we suggest to build IPv6-only network and the
   transition of IPv4 to IPv6 includes four types: native IPv6, single
   translation, double translation, encapsulation.

   In this scenario, the host first try is to visit server in native mode
   (IPv6 to IPv6);

   If the host and server are in different environment, the host tries
   single translation (IPv6 to IPv4);

   If there are access difficulties using single translation (ALG, IPv4-
   only application, etc), the host tries double translation (IPv6 to

   IPv4 to IPv6);

   For some applications (IPSec), if double translation doesn't work,
   the host uses encapsulation (IPv4 over IPv6).

   The topology shown in Figure 1 concludes the four steps:

   The process Host 1/Host 2 - CPE - IPv6 Router - core - IPv4 Internet
   is for double translation and encapsulation;

   The process Host 3 - IPv6 Router - IPv6 Network is for native IPv6;

   The process Host 1/Host 2 - CPE - IPv6 Router - IPv6 Network is for
   single translation.
