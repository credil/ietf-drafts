This memo specifies how to incorporate International Data Encryption
Algorithm (IDEA) into CMS or S/MIME as an additional strong algorithm
for symmetric encryption.  For organizations who make use of IDEA for
data security purposes it is of high interest that IDEA is also
available in S/MIME.  The intention of this memo is to provide the
OIDs and algorithms required that IDEA can be included in S/MIME for
symmetric content and key encryption.

This document is a product of the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group
of the IETF.
