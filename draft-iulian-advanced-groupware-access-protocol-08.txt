                   Advanced Groupware Access Protocol
           draft-iulian-advanced-groupware-access-protocol-08

Abstract

   The Advanced Groupware Access Protocol, (AGAP) allows a client to
   access and store electronic mail messages, contacts, events, files,
   and configurations on a server.  The electronic mail messages can be
   grouped in folders.  AGAP also provides the capability for an offline
   client to resynchronize with the server.

   AGAP does not specify a means of posting electronic mail messages;
   this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as SMTP
   [RFC2821] .  It also does not specify a means for exchanging messages
   with contacts that are reported as being online; this function is
   handled by an instant messaging protocol such as XMPP [RFC3921] .

   AGAP includes the following operations for electronic mail messages:
   creating, deleting, renaming, moving and coping mail folders;
   checking for new messages; permanently removing messages; moving and
   coping messages between folders; fetching information about a
   message; setting and clearing tags for messages; searching in
   messages; retrieving only a part of a message; marking messages as
   SPAM; deleting attachments from a message.

   AGAP includes the following operations to manipulate the contacts:
   creating, deleting, moving, coping, tagging, and searching contacts;
   checking if a contact is online; fetching information about a
   contact.

   AGAP includes the following operations related to the use of the
   events: creating, deleting, moving, coping and tagging events in
   calendar; fetching events details; searching for events.

   All items are read and written in format XML encoded UTF-8 [RFC3629]
   and each item is identified by a unique alphanumeric identifier.

   AGAP is designed to support access only to a single server per
   connection.  It is also designed to balance the volume of text
   exchanged between the server and clients and its readability by
   humans for debugging.

1.  How to Read This Document

1.1.  Organization of This Document

   This document is written from the point of view of someone
   implementing an AGAP client or server, and also from the point of
   view of a server administrator.  The protocol overview (chapter 2)
   presents all aspects related to a correct implementation (like the
   maximum length of a command or response line, charset used).  The
   material in chapter 3 through 5 provides the states in which can be a
   connection at a moment, respectively what commands are valid in each
   state and their valid responses.  Chapter 6 makes a summary of the
   return codes for each command.  The implementers find in chapter 7
   samples of conversations so that they can test the compliance of
   their applications with this standard.

1.2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   Document conventions are noted in this chapter.  The key words
   "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in 'Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate
   Requirement Levels' [RFC2119] .  The word "CAN" (not "MAY") is used
   to refer to a possible circumstance or situation, as opposed to an
   optional facility of the protocol.

   "User" is used to refer to a human user.  "Client" refers to the
   software being run by the user.  "Server" refers to the software
   responding to the client requests.  In examples, "C:" and "S:"
   indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.
   "Connection" refers to the entire sequence of client/server
   interaction from the initial establishment of the network connection
   until its termination.  "Conversation" is an exchange of commands and
   responses between the client and the server.  "Account" defines all
   folders and their content that can be accessed from Authenticated
   State.  All references to characters order is according to the UTF-8
   [RFC3629] specification.


2.  Protocol Overview

2.1.  Charset Used for Commands and Responses

   All data exchanged between the server and the client is done using
   strings encoded UTF-8 [RFC3629] .  If the server or client send a
   string incorrect encoded then the other side can close immediately
   the connection.

   A command or response consists of a line of text that has a maximal
   length of 1024 characters (including line end).  A line of text is
   ended with the character LF (0x0A).  There can be optionally a CR
   character (0x0D) before the LF character.  If the server or client
   sends a line with a length greater of 1024 then the other side can
   close immediately the connection.

2.3.  Numbers in Commands and Responses

   The numbers that are used in commands are signed integers on 32 bits.
   The valid values are between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.

2.4.  Regular Expressions in Commands

   Following is a resume of all regular expression rules that CAN be
   used by the commands defined in this standard:

2.5.  Unique Identification Numbers (UID)

   The length of an UID is between 1 and 32 characters.

   The UIDs MUST to be unique only between items from the same folder.

   The characters accepted for building an UID are only all 26 Latin
   letters (A-Z) in lowercase and uppercase and all 10 Latin digits
   (0-9).  An UID is case sensitive and it is the same for each
   connections, except after server change it and announce the change by
   changing the ECID assigned to the corresponding folder.

   Any new item MUST have a bigger UID as all other existing items in
   the selected folder.  The sorting is made according UTF-8 [RFC3629]
   (digits before letters and uppercase letters before the lowercase
   letters - 0..9A..Za..z).  A shorter UID is before a longer one (9234
   before 02345) and any zero (0) before a number is take into account
   by the server when two UIDs are compared.

   We get an approximately maximum number of 4.50+e+17 unique
   combinations for 32 characters long UIDs.  We get a maximum number of
   3381098545 unique combinations for 8 characters long UIDs.

2.6.  Folder Change Identification Numbers (FCID)

   An FCID has the same format as a normal UID and each new value of an
   FCID is bigger as the precedent one (as is described for UIDs).  An
   FCID is changed for a folder when the structure of the folder is
   changed (subfolders are added or removed).  The FCID of a folder is
   not changed if it is changed the (sub)child of one of its children.

2.7.  Entries Change Identification Numbers (ECID)

   An ECID has the same format as a normal UID and each new value of an
   ECID is bigger as the precedent one (as is described for UIDs).  If
   the last ECID has already had the biggest valid UID value then its
   new value can be the first valid UID value.  An ECID is changed for a
   folder when items ware added or removed.  Or when the server had
   changed the UIDs assigned to the items.  This can be necessary if,
   for example, there is a new item and already last valid UID was
   assigned to an other item.  The new UIDs must keep the items in the
   same order as before the renumbering.

2.8.  Representation of Text and Binary Content in XML Bodies

   Binary content must be encoded using the BASE64 [RFC4648] method and
   the corresponding tag must have the ENCODED attribute set to
   "base64".

   A text content can be passed as it is ( UTF-8 [RFC3629] ) or it can
   be encoded using the BASE64 [RFC4648] method.  The corresponding tag
   must have the ENCODED attribute set to "utf-8", in case of plain
   text, and to "base64", if the content was encoded using the BASE64
   method.

2.9.  SRV record

   An SRV record (Service record) defines the location in the DNS
   (Domain Name System) of a server providing a specified service.  It
   is defined in RFC 2782 [RFC2782] .  A non-secured port is searched
   with _agap and a secured port with _agaps as _service name.

   An SRV record has the form:

   _service._proto.name ttl IN SRV priority weight port target

   o  service - the symbolic name of the desired service;

   o  proto - the transport protocol of the desired service (TCP or
      UDP);

   o  name - the domain name for which this record is valid;

   o  ttl - standard DNS time to live field (usually 86400);

   o  priority - the priority of the target host (lower value means more
      preferred);

   o  weight - a relative weight for records with the same priority;

   o  port - the TCP or UDP port on which the service is present;

   o  target - the canonical hostname of the machine providing the
      service.

   The following textual item can be used to specify the location of an
   AGAP service:

   _agap._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 143 agapserver.example.com.

   The following textual item can be used to specify the location of a
   secured AGAP port (via SSL):

2.10.  Folders

2.10.1.  Naming

   All folder names are case sensitive and they are encoded according to
   UTF-8 [RFC3629] .

   A backslash (\) does not escape the character after it (it has no
   special meaning).

   For building a folder name, the user CAN use all UTF-8 [RFC3629]
   characters with a value bigger then 0x1f (white space is the first
   allowed character), but with the exception of the slash (/ 9x2F),
   back slash (\ 0x5C), multiplication sign (* 0x2A), and question mark
   (? 0x3F).

   The following folder names are also not accepted: '.', and '..'.

2.10.2.  Hierarchy

   None of the reserved folders can have subfolders, exception makes the
   TRASH that must to store also deleted folders and FILESHARE that
   holds ordinary files.

   The character used for delimiting path levels is the slash (/).  A
   path that starts with '/' represents an absolute path.  All other are
   relative to currently selected folder (with SLCT).

   If there is no folder currently selected then the client MUST use
   only absolute paths.  It is recommended for a client to use always
   absolute paths.

2.10.3.  Folder Types

   The following folder types are defined by this standard:

   o  contacts - ADDR - holds contact information;

   o  calendar - CALE - holds events;

   o  configuration - CONF - holds user accounts configuration (the
      client is free to store all information it needs for providing
      roaming);

   o  files - FILE - holds files that have no special meanings for the
      server;

Internet-Draft                    AGAP                     November 2013


   o  filter - FILT - holds the definition of a filter (it does not
      allow subfolders);

   o  folder - FOLD - contains only subfolders;

   o  journal - JRNL - holds journal items;

   o  message - MESG - holds e-mail messages;

   o  notes - NOTE - holds short texts;

   o  tasks - TASK - holds tasks.

   Each of these types allow for subfolders in them.

2.10.4.  Reserved Folders

   All the following reserved folders are located in the root of the
   user's account:

   o  CALENDAR - CALE - holds the main calendar of the user (PUBLIC);

   o  CONFIGURATION - CONF - holds account configuration;

   o  CONTACT - ADDR - holds the main contact list (PUBLIC);

   o  DRAFT - MESG - holds templates for e-mail messages;

   o  FILESHARE - FILE - holds shared files (PUBLIC);

   o  INBOX - MESG - holds all new e-mail messages (PUBLIC);

   o  JOURNAL - JRNL - holds the main journal (PUBLIC);

   o  JUNK - MESG - holds all e-mail messages marked as SPAM or VIRUSED
      by user or the server;

   o  NOTE - NOTE - holds short texts (PUBLIC);

   o  OUTBOX - MESG - holds all e-mail messages that wait to be sent;

   o  SENT - MESG - holds copy of sent e-mail messages;

   o  TASK - TASK - holds the main tasks list (PUBLIC);

   o  TRASH - MESG - holds all deleted e-mail messages;

   A client can use different names for these folders when display them

   so that the client application can use localization and standard or
   customized names for them.  If this is the case, then the user cannot
   create a folder, in the root of his account, with the same name as
   the real (reserved) name of the folder.

2.11.  Tags

2.11.1.  Syntax

   The client can set tags for folder and folder items.  The tags of a
   folder are reported by the STAT command and can be read with GFTG.
   The tags of an item can be get with GTAG.  The tags of a server can
   be set with SFTG, and the tags for folder items with STAG.

   The format of a tag is a name optionally followed by the equal sign
   (=) and a value.  Each time a tag is set, the new value replace the
   old one.  All tags that have no value assigned are returned only as
   names.  Assigning an empty value to a tag makes it to return a name
   followed by the equal sign and no value.  Setting a tag without a
   value for an item which previously had the same tag with a value
   makes the tag to lose its value and to be returned as name only
   (without the equal sign).

   The characters accepted for building a TAG are only all 26 Latin
   letters (A-Z) in uppercase, all 10 Latin digits (0-9) and the minus
   sign (-).  A TAG is case insensitive.  Its length is between 1 and 32
   characters.

   The characters accepted for a TAG value are only all 26 Latin letters
   (A-Z) in lowercase and uppercase, all 10 Latin digits (0-9), plus the
   minus (-), underscore (_) and dot (.) characters.  A TAG value is
   case sensitive.  Its length is between 1 and 32 characters.

   The server returns always the TAG names in uppercase, even if the
   client set them using a lowercase version.  The server should convert
   silently any lowercase character in a TAG name (sent by client) to
   its corresponding uppercase character.

2.11.2.  Reserved Tag Names

   The following tag names have a meaning set by this standard for
   folders:

   o  HIDDEN - this folder must not be advertised to the user in GUI;

   o  FIX-TAGS - the tags of this folder cannot be changed with FTGS;

Internet-Draft                    AGAP                     November 2013


   o  NO-COPY - the content of this folder cannot be copied with CPFC,
      CPYF, COPY, or FCPY but can be deleted with DELF, DELE, or FDEL or
      moved with MVFC, MOVE, MOVF, or FMOV;

   o  NO-DELETE - the folder or the content of this folder cannot be
      deleted with DELF, DELE or FDEL but can be copied with CPFC, COPY,
      or FCPY or moved with MVFC, MOVE, or FMOV;

   o  NO-DELF - this folder cannot be deleted with DELF but its content
      can be deleted with DELF, DELE, or FDEL if the tag NO-DELETE is
      not assigned to the folder;

   o  NO-FOLDERS - this item cannot have subfolders, so the user cannot
      create subfolders in it with MAKE;

   o  NO-MOVE - the content of this folder cannot be moved with MVFC,
      MOVE, MOVF, or FMOV but can be deleted with DELF, DELE, or FDEL or
      copied with CPFC, COPY, or FCPY;

   o  NO-RENAME - the name of this folder cannot be changed with NAME;

   o  READ-ONLY - the user can read it with RETR and delete it with
      DELF, DELE, or FDEL but cannot write in it with STOR, CPFC, COPY,
      FCPY, MVFC, MOVE, or FMOV, create subfolders in it with MAKE or
      change the tags of its content with STAG, or FTAG;

   o  RESERVED - it is a folder reserved by this standard; the user can
      write in it with STOR but cannot delete it with DELF, moved with
      MVFC or rename it with NAME;

   When the user do a DELF for a folder with the tag NO-DELF but without
   the tag NO-DELETE then the non-folder content will gone be deleted
   but not the folder.

   When the user do a DELF for a folder with the tag NO-DELETE then the
   folder and its content will not gone be deleted (the tag NO-DELF is
   ignored).

   Implicit a folder can be read only by its owner.

   The following tag names have a meaning set by this standard for
   messages:

   o  ANSWERED - a replay was sent for this item;

   o  FORWARDED - the message was forwarded by the user;

   o  SEEN - the message was sow by the user;

   o  SPAM - this e-mail message is marked as spam;

2.12.  Folder's Access Rights and Access Control List (ACL)

   An access right is represented by a letter between a and z,
   respectivelly between A and Z. A lowercase letter represents a
   different right then its uppercase version.

   This document defines following rights:

   o  r - it is allowed to read folder's attributes and tags;

   o  A - it is allowed to add items to the folder;

   o  D - it is allowed to delete items from folder;

   o  L - it is allowed to find which items (IDs) holds the folder;

   o  R - it is allowed to read the folder's items

   The ACL of a folder is made from pairs of rights and an account name.
   The rights are checked only at the access moment in the state STORING
   and PRESENCE.

   The account name is a regexp as defined in chapter 2.4 Regular
   Expressions in Commands .

2.13.  The Responses for Each Type of Folder

2.13.1.  Format and Conventions

   All responses are in XML format.  The tags and their attributes names
   are written only in uppercase.  The values for attributes only in
   lowercase.  The exception are header items for a message.  The tags
   keep the case from the message.

   The content is encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629] format.

   Each type of folder returns its items in a different format.

   Each tag written in uppercase must to be send as it is, each tag
   written in lowercase will be replaced with the right value at the
   time of generation.

   Each tag that have a question mark will be present only once if it is
   the case and without the question mark.

   Each tag that have a star will be present, possible many times, only
   if it is the case and without the star.

   If a command is correct but the server cannot execute it because of
   an internal error, then the server returns the code 401.

2.13.2.  Response for Calendar Folders

   The format is derived from the one defined for VEVENT and VALARM by
   the iCalendar [RFC5545] standard.

   The following example corresponds to this VEVENT definition:


   BEGIN:VEVENT

   The BEGIN:VEVENT is replaced with <VEVENT> and END:VEVENT is replaced
   with </VEVENT>.  The BEGIN:VALARM is replaced with <VALARM> and END:
   VALARM is replaced with </VALARM>.  Each type in VEVENT/VALARM has a
   corresponding tag in uppercase.  All attributes are lowercase.  Any
   escaped semicolon or comma in VEVENT/VALARM is also passed prefixed
   with a backslash in XML.  Any \n is replaced with a real end of line.
   The VEVENT/VALARM attributes LANGUAGE, VALUE and CHARSET must not be
   present in XML.  The attribute ENCODING="BASE64" is replaced with
   ENCODED="base64", any other encoding scheme is silently dropped.  The
   client can also send an attribute ENCODED="utf-8" as this is the
   default encoding for tags.  The format for a timestamp is: yyyy-mm-
   ddThh:mm:ssZ.  All times are UTC/GMT times according Representation
   of dates and times [ISO.8601.1988].  As VEVENT/VALARM attribute VALUE
   is missing then the format of the value is detected automatically
   based on the context.  For example, a value starting with 'http://'
   corresponds to a 'VALUE=uri'; an 'ENCODED="base64"' corresponds to a
   'VALUE=binary'.  Were VEVENT/VALARM standar accepts a date or a date-
   time then we expect to receive a timestamp (date-time).  There are
   not accepted tags that corresponds to VEVENT/VALARM types having
   'VALUE=uri:CID:', so referincing parts that cannot exists in this

   XML.  The DURATION must be always a relative value in seconds.  As a
   VALARM is no more a child of a VEVENT we need to link the two
   entities.  A VEVENT with an associated VALARM must include an ALARM
   tag having the UID of the associated VALARM.  A VALARM must have an
   UID defined and a RELATED-TO tag holding the UID of the associated
   VEVENT.  An VEVENT can have only one VALARM associated.

2.13.3.  Response for Configuration Folders

   A response holding the configuration has the following structure:

   The BEGIN:VCARD is replaced with <VCARD> and END:VCARD is replaced
   with </VCARD>.  Each type in VCARD has a corresponding tag.  As in
   RFC all types are defined in uppercase so are also defined all tags.
   All attributes are lowercase.  All values of attribute TYPE from a
   VCARD must to be gathered together in a single list and passed as
   attribute TYPE to the corresponding tag (they are delimited by
   commas).  Any escaped semicolon or comma in VCARD is also passed
   prefixed with a backslash in XML.  Any \n is replaced with a real end
   of line.  The VCARD attributes LANGUAGE, VALUE, CONTEXT and CHARSET
   must not be present in XML.  The attribute ENCODING="b" is replaced
   with ENCODED="base64", any other encoding scheme is silently dropped.
   The client can also send an attribute ENCODED="utf-8" as this is the
   default encoding for tags.  The format for a date is: YYYY-MM-DD.
   The format for a time is: HH:MM:SS.  The format for a timestamp is:
   yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ.  All times are UTC/GMT times according

   Representation of dates and times [ISO.8601.1988].  As VCARD
   attribute VALUE is missing then the format of the value is detected
   automatically based on the context.  For example, a value starting
   with 'http://' corresponds to a 'VALUE=uri'; an 'ENCODED="base64"'
   corresponds to a 'VALUE=binary'.  Were VCARD standar accepts a date
   or a date-time then we expect to receive a timestamp (date-time).  It
   is not accepted an attribute SOURCE for VCARD type as the content of
   this VCARD must be defined inside of the XML.  Also are not accepted
   tags that corresponds to VCARD types having 'VALUE=uri:CID:', so
   referincing parts that cannot exists in this XML.

2.13.5.  Response for File Folders

   A response holding the content of a file has the following structure:


   <FILE>
       <NAME>name</NAME>
       <TYPE>mime/type</TYPE>
       <DESCRIPTION>a short text</DESCRIPTION>
       <CONTENT encoded="utf-8|base64">content</CONTENT>
   </FILE>

                                 Figure 10

   The valid encodings type are: utf-8 and base64.  The default encoding
   is base64.

   Example:


   <FILE>
       <NAME>Example.txt</NAME>
       <TYPE>text/plain</TYPE>
       <DESCRIPTION>my first example</DESCRIPTION>
       <CONTENT encoded="base64">c3VyZS4=</CONTENT>
   </FILE>

                                 Figure 11

   The DESCRIPTION tag do not accept an encoded attribute and the text
   must not have in it empty lines.  If the text has empty lines then
   the server must refuse to accept this XML.

2.13.6.  Response for Filter Folders

   An entryTag can be: AND, OR, NOT, UID, TAG, IS, REGEX.  The value
   associated to entryTag is specified as an XML text node.  The IS and

   REGEX tags have two attributes: PATH and OP.  Their values are set as
   for a filter command (see chapter 4.3 Syntax of a Filter for more
   information).  The tag RULES group all its rules in an AND group.

   There must be assigned at least one folder and must be present at
   least a rule.  Optionally can be gived a description using ABOUT tag.
   Cannot be assigned as folders for being searched folders of the
   following types: FILT, FOLD.

   A response holding the content of a file has the following structure:

2.13.7.  Response for Journal Folders

   The format is derived from the one defined for VJOURNAL by the
   iCalendar [RFC5545] standard.

   The following example corresponds to this VJOURNAL definition:

   ddThh:mm:ssZ.  All times are UTC/GMT times according Representation
   of dates and times [ISO.8601.1988].  As VTODO attribute VALUE is
   missing then the format of the value is detected automatically based

   corresponds to a 'VALUE=uri'; an 'ENCODED="base64"' corresponds to a
   'VALUE=binary'.  Were VJOURNAL standar accepts a date or a date-time

2.13.8.  Response for Message Folders

   A response holding the content of a message has the following
   structure:


   <MESSAGE>
       <HEADER>
           <header-item-once>value</header-item-once>...
           <header-item-multi>value 1

       </ATTACHMENT-{id}>...
   </MESSAGE>

                                 Figure 16

   The first attachment id has value 1.

   The id of on item tag shows the order of the items in the original
   message.

   The default content encoding is utf-8.  It is assumed that the
   content for TEXT and HTML is encoded in UTF-8 when the ENCODED
   attribut has the value base64.

   The items in the header of the main message and attachments are the

   same with the one from the e-mail message.

   There can be at most 2,147,483,647 attachments defined and their
   numbers must be sequential starting with 1.

   Example:

2.13.9.  Response for Note Folders

   A response holding the content of the note has the following

   Note: the subject can be any short text.  The content can be encoded
   UTF-8 or BASE64.  Implicit is content encoded in utf-8.  The type can
   be any subtype of 'text/*'.  Implicit is 'text/plain'.  It is
   recommended to be used only 'text/plain' and 'text/html'.

   Example:

   XML.  The DURATION must be always a relative value (starts with a P
   or -P).  As a VALARM is no more a child of a VTODO we need to link
   the two entities.  A VTODO with an associated VALARM must include an

   have an UID defined and a RELATED-TO tag holding the UID of the
   associated VTODO.  An VTODO can have only one VALARM associated.


3.  States

3.1.  Not-authenticated State

   This is the default state when a new connection is made to the
   server.  The client becomes a welcome message.

   From this state the client can use the command 'AUTH mechanism' to
   move in the 'Pre-authentication State'.  This is the only other state
   in which the server can go.

   The client can use the command 'STLS' for commuting in the encrypted
   mode of the channel.  After STLS the server remains in the 'Not-
   authenticated State'.  There is no command for switching back to
   clear-text communication.

   The client can use the command 'SGZP' for commuting in the compressed
   mode of the channel.  After SGZP the server remains in the 'Not-
   authenticated State'.  There is no command for switching back to not-
   compressed communication.

   A client can use at the same time the both modes (encrypted and
   compressed).

   The client can use the command 'QUIT' for terminating the connection.

   For finding what extensions are installed in server, the client can
   use the 'CAPA' command.

3.2.  Pre-authentication State

   This is the state where a client authenticate itself and move to the
   'Authenticated State' or returns to the 'Not-authenticated State'.

   This standard defines only one method for AUTH: PLAIN.  Following is
   a description of the commands flow used by this authentication
   mechanism.

   The client must send a 'USER account' followed by a 'PASS password'
   (if the server confirms the acceptance of the account name).  If the

   pair account and password is accepted then the server move to the
   state 'Authenticated State' and the folder INBOX is selected by
   server.  If this folder does not exist then the server moves in the
   'Not-Selected State' and the client must to select an existing folder
   for operating with this account.  If this pair is rejected then the
   server returns to the 'Not-authenticated State'.  That means that the
   client must to send a new 'AUTH mechanism' for trying a new
   authentication.

   The client can use the command 'QUIT' for terminating the connection.

   A client can enter into this state only after a successful 'AUTH'
   command in 'Not-authenticated State'.

3.3.  Authenticated (and Selected) State

   This is the state from which a client operates with the content of an
   account.

   From this state the client can use the command 'EXIT' to move in the
   'Not-authenticated State'.  After an unsuccessful SLCT, the server
   goes in 'Not-selected State'.

   The client can use the command 'QUIT' for terminating the connection.

   Check the following chapter for finding which commands can be
   performed from this state.

   A client can enter into this state only after a successful
   authentication in the 'Pre-authenticated State' or after a successful
   'SLCT' command in the 'Authenticated State' or 'Not-selected State'.

3.4.  (Authenticated but) Not-selected State

   This is the state from which a client must to select a folder for
   performing further operations.

   From this state the client must use the command 'SLCT' to select a
   folder and to move in the 'Authenticated State'.  This is the only
   other state in which the server can go.

   The client CAN use the command 'LIST' for finding valid folder names
   that eventually CAN be selected with 'SLCT' command.

   The client CAN use the command 'QUIT' for terminating the connection.

   A client CAN enter into this state only after an unsuccessful 'SLCT'
   command or if the INBOX folder does not exists and it cannot be

   selected automatically after a successful authentication.

3.5.  Presence State

   This is the state in which a client can only ask information about
   the presence of an user/account.

   In this state the client can use only the command 'PGET' to ask for
   presence information of an account (inclusive finding when a meeting
   can be scheduled) and the command 'QUIT' for terminating the
   connection.

3.6.  Storing State

   This is the state in which a client can only add items (for example:
   messages, events) in an account which it is not his/her.

   In this state the client can use only the command 'FSTO' to find and
   store the item into a folder of specified type from specified user
   and the command 'QUIT' for terminating the connection.


4.  Commands

4.1.  Semantic and Syntax

   Each command has its name from 4 letters and it is matched case-
   insensitive.

   Each command is separated by its arguments by a 0x20 character.
   Also, each argument is separated from its adjacent arguments by a
   0x20 character.

   The minimal response has only the return code without any text.

   A list of elements is enclosed between parentheses (round brackets).

4.2.  Syntax of a Tag List

   A tag list is used by the following commands: FTAG, GTAG, SFTG and
   STAG.

   A tag list defines what action to be done with its tags.

   Syntax: ACTION TAG TAG=VALUE ...

   ACTION:

   o  = - set only these tags;

   o  + - add these tags

   o  - - delete these tags.

   Note: When it is used the delete tags action and for a tag is set a
   value then the tag is deleted only if the current value match the
   value found in the delete command.  If in delete command is specified
   a value for a tag which actually has no value set then this tag is
   not deleted.  If in delete command is specified only the name of a
   tag without a value and the tag has a value assigned then the tag is
   deleted.

   Example:


   C: STAG UIDx1234 = SEEN SPAM=YES
   C: STAG UIDx1234 + SEEN FLAG=RED OWNER=RAI
   C: STAG UIDx1234 - FLAG JUNK OWNER=JOHN SEEN=

                                 Figure 24

   Note: After this three commands we have only the following tags: SEEN
   SPAM=YES JUNK OWNER=RAI.

4.3.  Syntax of a Filter

4.3.1.  Syntax of a Filter for a Command

   A filter of this type is used by the following commands: FCPY, FDEL,
   FTAG, FIND and FMOV.

   A filter defines rules for matching items.  It is defined as lines
   with rules and it is ended by an empty line.

   The keywords of the filter are case insensitive matched (ex.: UID and
   Uid are the same).

   A rule must be completely defined in the same line (exception are
   grouping, AND, OR, and NOT rules).

   Accepted rules:

   o  ( ) - grouping for AND and OR;

   o  AND - all following rules are with AND bonded (until the end of
      the current group).  It is the implicit rule when the first rule

      is not an AND or an OR;

   o  OR - all following rules are with OR bonded (until the end of the
      current group);

   o  NOT - invert the result of the following rule;

   o  UID uid - one UID;

   o  UID uid_begin_range:uid_end_range - inclusive range (uid_end_range
      is optional and if it missing then it is assumed the maximum valid
      UID: 32 of lower-case letter z);

   o  TAG tag_name - a tag of an item;

   o  TAG tag_name=tag_value - an item's tag with a value (tag_value is
      the complete value);

   o  IS field_path op string - a field from the content (as XML) with
      an exact matched text (string is written between ' and ' can be
      escaped with \'); op can be: <, <=, =, !=, >=, >;

   o  REGEX field_path op regex_string - a field from the content (as
      XML) with a regular expression matched text (regex_string is
      written between ' and ' can be escaped with \'); op can be: =, !=;
      the regex_string can match only a part of the content.

   o  NEW - it is true if an item is marked as new; after a new item was
      reported or retrieved (by DATT, FIND, FRTR, RETC, RETR or a filter
      folder) it will be marked as no longer being new and it will not
      be matched by a new search for new items.

   The field_path is a PATH as it is returned by RETR and must point to
   a not binary end leaf.  It contains only tag names separated with /.
   Example: /MESSAGE/HEADER/subject, /MESSAGE/HEADER/received, /MESSAGE/
   TEXT, /MESSAGE/HTML, /MESSAGE/ATTACHMENT-1/HEADER/type, /MESSAGE/
   ATTACHMENT-1/BODY.  There is an exception, for FILT folder types the
   path /FILTER/FOLDERS returns the list of folders with a folder path
   per line and the path /FILTER/FOLDERS/FOLDER is invalid.

   Searching for a TAG without associating and a value to it will match
   all items having this tag, even if it have values set for it.

   It can be searched only in the body of attachments that have a
   content type of type 'text/*'.

   Example 1: These filters find all messages with the UID between
   UIDx0001:UIDx1000 and that were seen and marked as being spam or

   having a virus (the AND is redundant in the second case).  Both
   filter definitions are equivalent.


   C: UID UIDx0001:UIDx1000 OR ( TAG SPAM TAG HAS=VIRUS ) TAG SEEN
   C: UID UIDx0001:UIDx1000 AND( OR ( TAG SPAM TAG HAS=VIRUS ) TAG SEEN)

                                 Figure 25

   Example 2:


   C: IS /MESSAGE/HEADER/subject = 'From University'
   C: REGEX /MESSAGE/HEADER/FROM != '[^0-9]+@example\.com$'
   C: IS /VCARD/FN = 'Anonymous'
   C: REGEX /VCARD/ORG = '^[A-Za-z]+[0-9]$'

                                 Figure 26

4.3.2.  Syntax of a Filter for a FILT Folder

   A filter of this type is used by the following command: STOR.

   A filter defines rules for matching the different messages from
   different folders.  It is defined as an XML with target folders and
   rules.

   The keywords of the filter are case sensitive matched (ex.: UID and
   Uid are not the same).  They are always lowercase.

   Accepted rules:

   o  AND - all its items must be matched;

   o  OR - at least one of its items must be matched;

   o  NOT - invert the result of its child rule;

   o  UID uid - one UID;

   o  UID uid_begin_range:uid_end_range - inclusive range;

   o  TAG tag_name - a tag;

   o  TAG tag_name=tag_value - a tag with a value (tag_value is the
      complete value);

   o  IS field_path op string - a field from the content (as XML) with
      an exact matched text (string is written between ' and ' can be
      escaped with \'); op can be: <, <=, =, !=, >=, >;

   o  REGEX field_path op regex_string - a field from the content (as
      XML) with a regular expression matched text (regex_string is
      written between ' and ' can be escaped with \'); op can be: =, !=;
      the regex_string can match only a part of the content.

   The field_path is a PATH as it is returned by RETR and must point to
   a not binary end leaf.  It contains only tag names separated with /.
   Example: /MESSAGE/HEADER/subject, /MESSAGE/HEADER/received, /MESSAGE/
   TEXT, /MESSAGE/HTML, /MESSAGE/ATTACHMENT-1/BODY.  There is an
   exception, for FILT folder types the path /FILTER/FOLDERS returns the
   list of folders with a folder path per line and the path /FILTER/
   FOLDERS/FOLDER is invalid.

   Searching for a TAG without associating and a value to it will match
   all items that have this tag even if it have values set for it (the
   empty string is also considered matched).

   The following two examples corresponds to the two examples from the
   previous chapter:

4.4.  The Welcome Message - not-authenticated state

   Results: 200 401 410 531

   Result 200 - the client is accepted for sending commands;

   Result 401 - there was an internal error;

   Result 410 - too many connections;

   Result 531 - the client is rejected permanently.

   Description: When a client connects to the server it receives a
   welcome message.  This message begins with a response code that shows
   if the client is accepted for sending commands.

   The PLAIN Authentication Mechanism: the client send the username and
   password in clear text using the commands USER and PASS.

   The MD5 and SHA1 Authentication Mechanisms: the server send an
   additional line starting with a dot and providing a prefix that will
   gone be used by the client to send back to the server an MD5 or SHA-1
   value computed on the string build from this prefix and user's
   password.  This prefix can have between 1 and 256 characters.
   Allowed characters are any UTF-8 characters having a code bigger the
   decimal value 31 (first valid character is space).  The initial dot
   is not part of the prefix.  The client send the username and the
   computed hash using the commands USER and HASH.

   The PRESENCE Authentication Mechanism: this mechanism is used by a
   client to query the presence of an user having an account on the
   server.  If the server knows to forward the request to other servers
   (in case that requested account in not local) then it can return the
   answer from the remote server.  The client send the username and
   password in clear text using the commands USER and PASS.  For an
   anonymous access the server can accept as username anonymous and as
   password the email address of the connecting user.  Once the username
   and password are accepted, the server enters in the presence state
   and the client can execute only the commands PGET and QUIT.

   The PRESENCE-MD5 and PRESENCE-SHA1 Authentication Mechanisms: these
   mechanisms are working similar with MD5 and SHA1 authentication
   mechanisms, only that move the server in the same status as PRESENCE
   authentication mechanism.

   The STORING Authentication Mechanism: this mechanism is used by a
   client to store items in accounts which are not his/hers.  The client
   send the username and password in clear text using the commands USER
   and PASS.  For an anonymous access the server can accept as username
   anonymous and as password the email address of the connecting user.
   Once the username and password are accepted, the server enters in the
   storing state and the client can execute only the commands FSTO and
   QUIT.

   The STORING-MD5 and STORING-SHA1 Authentication Mechanisms: these
   mechanisms are working similar with MD5 and SHA1 authentication
   mechanisms, only that move the server in the same status as STORING
   authentication mechanism.

   Result 200 - the communication is now compressed.

   Result 510 - unknown/unsupported command.

   Description: Change the communication in compressed mode using GZIP
   [RFC1952] as compression method.  If this command is executed from
   the compression mode then it simply returns a 200 response code.  The
   response to this command is using still the not-compressed mode of
   the channel.  The compression becomes effective only after a 200
   response line was send by the server.

   Note: With GZIP the data is compressed using the LZ77 algorithm and
   Huffman coding.  Starting using this mode is like starting to write
   clear texts into a GZIP format archive and reading texts from a GZIP
   format archive.  The compression is used both by the client and the
   server and they start to use it with the next line they send after
   the 200 response line received from the server.

   Result 511 - wrong filter or items parts.

   Description: Search for items only from currently selected folder (no
   subfolders) that correspond to a filter and return their UIDs
   together with the requested parts from them.  If the search is done
   for a filter folder then the server does not expect any filter and
   apply the current filter (if any).  If there is no filter in the
   filter folder then it is returned only the return code.  If there are
   no parts specified then only the UIDs are returned.  Each requested
   part becomes a number starting with 1 and being assigned in the same
   order as the fields.  It is defined a special part named TAGS which
   returns all tags associated to a UID.  Each tag is returned on its
   own line prefixed with the starting number.

   Note: The number 0 is reserved for the UID.  The answer consists of
   the UIDs and, for a filter folder, they are followed by a 0x20
   character and the absolute path for which are the corresponding UID.
   If the item is marked as new then the UID is prefixed with a
   multiplication sign (*).  The item is then marked as no longer being
   new.  If there is no match for the filter then it is returned a 220
   code.

   Note: For not FILT folders, the filter is delivered after the
   acceptance of the command.  An empty filter matches all items from

   Note: If there is present an argument USER then the user wants to
   obtain information about the status of an other user or himself.  If
   the server does not know how to obtain the information about this
   user then it returns an UNKNOWN as argument.  Otherways can return a
   list with all set texts.  After an HERE and AWAY is present when was
   this set, for an IDLE is the timestamp corresponding to the starting
   point of idle period.  In answer can be present only one of these
   three.  For a PSET FOR is returned an HERE for a PGET USER.

   Note: If there is present an argument BUSY or FREE then it is
   expected a list with timestamp periods and locations for which to be
   returned the list of busy, respectively free time frames.  The end of
   list is marked by sending an empty line to server.  Each list line
   has three fields: a start and inclusive end timestamp and a location.
   Between each argument is exactly only one space character (0x20).  A
   timestamp has the format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss and represents the time
   in UTC.  The meaning of the timestamp fields could be found in Date
   and Time on the Internet: Timestamps [RFC3339].  A location is a
   string or the star character (*) for matching any location.  The
   command returns a list with all available busy or free time frames
   for specified period and location.  If there cannot be found any busy
   or free time frame then no list is returned, but only a 200 return
   code.  The location name is compared which what was stored by the
   user, so there someone can write Vienna and someone else Wien, so the
   two of them cannot be found with a list having only one line and
   specifing a location.  The answer is made of pairs of start and
   inclusive end timestamps followed by the UID correspondig to the
   event associated with this time period.  In case there is no time
   period specified a 511 error is returned by server.

   Note: If there is present an argument UID then it is returned its
   associated content only if it is of type VEVENT.

   Description: Announce that the logged user is still online,
   eventually since when is idle.  A QUIT command or disconnection means
   that the user is no longer online.  In state PRESENCE only the "USER
   user" arguments are accepted.

   If there is present an argument HERE then that means the user is no
   longer idle.  As there is no information for how long this status is
   valid, then it will remain valid until comes a new command which
   change it.

   If there is present an argument AWAY then that means the user is no
   longer connected.  As there is no information for how long this
   status is valid, then it will remain valid until comes a new command
   which change it.

   If there is present an argument FOR then that means the user is
   suppose to be considered present for the given amount of time.  The
   client is expected to send its updated status in this period.  If
   comes no command to change the state in the specified time, then
   after this period the presence will be reported as unknown.  The
   arguments are as by IDLE.

   If there is present an argument IDLE then that means the user is idle
   and the arguments must be: IDLE number unit_of_time.  The number must
   be a positive number and the unit_of_time must be one of the
   following: sec, min, hour, day, year.  As there is no information for
   how long this status is valid, then it will remain valid until comes
   a new command which change it.

   If there is present an argument STATUS then the user want to change
   the text that is associated with its presence online.  After STATUS
   can follow any text.  The text ends to the end of line.  If there is
   no text then any previous text is deleted and no text is displayed as
   status text.

   If there is present an argument AT then that user want to change the
   text that is associated with its present location.  After AT can
   follow any text.  The text ends to the end of line.  If there is no
   text then any previous text is deleted and no text is displayed as
   location text.

   Description: Register an IP and port on client for announcing the
   client when there are new items received.  If there was already a
   record for this listening point then the old information are replaced
   with the new one.  The server will not send notification for AGAP
   folder of the following types: FILT, FOLD.  When it is noticed a
   change in a monitored folder then the server will send a line to
   registered listening point holding the new FCID of that folder and
   the path of changed folder.

   The ip and port are on client.  The server can check if the client is
   accessible on this port and if the ip is the same which the one from
   which comes the current connection.  If these checks fails then it
   returns an 410.

   The sec indicate how long should the server send notification on this
   listening point.  It must be a positive value, otherweis the server
   answers with 511.

   The filter is a set of AGAP folder types delimited with a white space
   or comma.  The server will gone send notifications only for changes
   in folders of this type.  Even if there are no notification send for
   FILT or FOLD they are accepted in the filter.  If the filter is
   missing then there are sent notification for all folder types except
   FILT and FOLD.

   Examples:


   C: PSHA 192.168.100.4 12345 900 MESG,CALE
   S: 200 OK We notify you for 15 min

                                Figure 166

   The notification send from the server to the client on registered
   listening point for changes in two AGAP folders:


   S: FCIDx1234 /INBOX/new messages folder
   S: FCIDx2345 /SPAM

4.51.  Command RPLC - authenticated state

   Name: replace an item

   Arguments: EID

   Result: 110 200 410 511

   Result 110 - the client can send the item.

   Result 200 - the item was successfully stored, the old eid (if
   present) was removed or there was no content sent by the client.

   Result 210 - the new item was stored but the old one was not deleted.

   Result 410 - if the item cannot be stored.

   Result 511 - if the data is not a valid XML or its schema does not
   correspond to the type of the destination folder.

   Description: Store a new item/filter into a folder and remove the
   item with provided EID if it is present.  If it is written a new
   filter into a FILT folder, then the previous filter is deleted.  If
   the new filter has an invalid XML structure or cannot be saved then
   the folder remains with the old filter (if any).  The server can send
   a 410 or 511 respons before the empty line is send, so the client
   must check after each sended line of content if the server had
   rejected the content.  If the old item cannot be removed the new item
   remais saved and a 210 return code instead of a 200 return code is
   produced.

   Note: Do not send a message content using CDATA as it can hold empty
   lines and an empty line means for the server the end of the message
   to be stored.  It is the atomic equivalent of STOR followed by DELE
   EID.

   Result 110 - the client can send the item.

   Result 200 - the item was successfully stored or there was no content
   sent by the client.

   Result 410 - if the item cannot be stored.

   Result 511 - if the data is not a valid XML or its schema does not
   correspond to the type of the destination folder.

   Description: Store a new item/filter into a folder.  If it is written
   a new filter into a FILT folder, then the previous filter is deleted.
   If the new filter has an invalid XML structure or cannot be saved
   then the folder remains with the old filter (if any).  The server can
   send a 410 or 511 respons before the empty line is send, so the
   client must check after each sended line of content if the server had
   rejected the content.

   Note: Do not send a message content using CDATA as it can hold empty
   lines and an empty line means for the server the end of the message
   to be stored.

4.58.  Command SUID - authenticated state

   Name: last UID returned by STOR, COPY, MOVE or RPLC

   Arguments: none

   Results: 200 511

   Result 200 - the command was accepted and eventually an UID was
   returned.

   Result 511 - the command is not accepted in the actual state.

   Description: This command returns the last UID generated by a STOR,
   COPY, MOVE or RPLC command in the currently selected folder since it
   was last time selected.  Selecting an other folder or leaving the
   actual state makes to forget last generated UID.  By selecting a
   folder, storing an item and then reselecting the same folder makes
   the UID to be forgot.  If there is no UID stored then is returned a
   200 without any line holding an UID.  A failling STOR, COPY, MOVE or
   RPLC also makes no UID to be remembered.

5.  Responses

5.1.  Semantic and Syntax

   The Response-Code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the
   attempt to understand and satisfy the request.  These codes are fully
   defined in the following section.

   After the Response-Code, can follow a 0x20 character and then a
   Reason-Phrase intended to give a short textual description of the
   returned code.  The Response-Code is intended for automatic use.  The
   Reason-Phrase is intended for humane persons that debug the
   connection.

   The first digit of the Response-Code defines the class of response.
   The last two digits do not have any categorization role.  There are 4
   values for the first digit:

   o  1xx: Informational - Server waits for request continuation or send
      unrequested data;

   o  2xx: Success - The action was successfully executed;

   o  4xx: Server Error - The server failed to perform the request,
      retry later;

   o  5xx: Server Error - The server failed to perform the request,
      permanent error;

   There are commands that return a multi-line response.  These are:
   CAPA, FIND, GTAG, LIST, RETR, and STAT.  In this cases, the response
   code is at the beginning of the last line of the response.  All other
   lines start with a dot (.).

5.2.  1xx Informational

5.2.1.  100 Reserved

   Reserved.

5.2.2.  110 Continue

   The client SHOULD continue sending the rest of this request.  This
   response informs the client that the server accepted the initial part
   of the request and it is waiting for the next part of the request.
   The server sends a final response after the request has been
   completely received and processed.

5.3.  2xx Success

5.3.1.  200 OK

   The request was successfully processed.

5.3.2.  210 Partial OK

   The request was successfully applied for at least one item but not
   for all requested items. (see FCPY, FDEL, FMOV, and FTAG)

5.3.3.  220 Nothing to do

   The request was successful, but none of the arguments were found.
   (see DACl, DPBL)

5.4.  4xx Temporary Server Error

5.4.1.  400 Reserved

   Reserved.

5.4.2.  401 Internal Error

   The request could not be processed because it was an internal error
   (ex.: something is wrong configured).

5.4.3.  410 Retry later

   The operation must to be retried later.  This return code is used
   when the data cannot be stored because there was an error (ex.: not
   enough space on disk) or the operation faild now but can succeed
   later (ex.: the client listen on proposed IP and port).

5.5.  5xx Permanent Server Error

5.5.1.  500 Reserved

   Reserved.

5.5.2.  510 Unknown Command

   The request could not be processed because this command is unknown or
   its syntax is wrong.

5.5.3.  511 Invalid Parameter Format

   The request could not be processed because the command has an invalid
   parameter.

   This answer can be returned even in the case when more than one 0x20
   character were present between command and its arguments or between
   arguments.

5.5.4.  512 Out of order

   This command has a valid syntax but must to be send after other
   command required by the logic of the server.  (Ex.: PASS after USER
   in Pre-authenticated State.)

5.5.5.  521 Not found

   This command has a valid syntax but the searched argument does not
   exist or cannot be accessed.  (Ex.: DATT did not found the attachment

   to delete.)

5.5.6.  531 Banned

   The client is not allowed to interact with the server.  (Ex.: the
   client's IP is blacklisted.)

5.5.7.  541 Not enough rights

   The client is not allowed to do the command because of insufficient
   rights.  If it had enough rights then the command would have been
   successful.  (Ex.: the client cannot store a message with FSTO.)
