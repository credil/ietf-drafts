    <abstract>
      <t>This document moves RFC4743 (Using NETCONF over the Simple Object
      Access Protocol (SOAP)) and RFC4744 (Using the NETCONF Protocol over
      the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP)) to HISTORIC status
      to reflect the fact that those two documents have shown very little
      (if any) implementations and deployment. Furthermore, no-one in the
      NETCONF WG is interested or volunteering to work on them anymore.

      accordance with <xref target="RFC2026">RFC&nbsp;2026</xref>.
      These two documents have seen very little (if any) implementations
      or deployment,
      and none of the initial proponents are active in the NETCONF space
      anymore. No-one (else) in the WG is interested or willing to pick up
      responsibility for these documents.

      If these 2 documents were to be kept current, then changes might be
      needed for compatibility with the current version of NETCONF 1.1.

      In the WG nobody gave a positive response  when asked who is using it

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
