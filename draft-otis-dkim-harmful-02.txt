                      DKIM is Harmful as Specified
                       draft-otis-dkim-harmful-02

Abstract

   Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be
   identified by an authenticated domain.  Unfortunately many hope to
   use DKIM as an alternative, but it is independent of intended
   recipients and domains accountable for sending the message.  This
   means DKIM is poorly suited for establishing abuse assessments for
   unsolicited messaging of commercial email otherwise known as SPAM,
   nor was this initially DKIM's intent.  DKIM lacks message context
   essential to ensure fair assessment and to ensure this assessment is
   not poisoned (Who initiated the transaction and to whom).

   DKIM was instead intended to establish increased levels of trust
   based upon valid DKIM signatures controlling acceptance and what a
   user sees within the FROM header field.  But DKIM failed to guard
   against pre-pended header fields where any acceptance based on valid
   DKIM signatures is sure to exclude header field spoofing, especially
   that of the FROM.  This weakness allows malefactors to exploit DKIM
   signature acceptance established by high-volume DKIM domains to spoof
   ANY other domain, even when prohibited within the Signer's network.

Internet-Draft                DKIM-HARMFUL                     June 2013


1.  Introduction

   Currently, IPv4 address reputation provides the primary basis for
   defending open SMTP services (acceptance without prior arrangement).
   Use of IP addresses in this role completely breaks down when dealing
   with IPv6 [RFC2460] due to data requirements and an inability to
   defend detection of subscription violations.  There are currently
   18,209,237,415,985,168 /64 equivalent IPv6 prefixes routed.
   [v6-BGP-Rpts].  In comparison, for IPv4 there are 2,614,654,096 IP
   addresses routed.  While IPv4 is reaching its maximum, IPv6 has about
   0.1% of the available /64 prefix routed and this continues to grow
   rapidly.  Unlike IPv4, there is no practical means to scan reverse
   DNS namespace within IPv6 since each /64 prefix may contain any
   number of PTR records ranging up to 184,000,000,000,000,000,000.

   A technique commonly employed to automate IPv4 address categorization
   of suitable hosts is to check whether reverse PTR records appear to
   represent valid hostnames.  Those that represent 4 decimal numbers
   are often considered unacceptable, for example.  Our processing of
   reverse DNS namespace in cooperation with network providers now
   excludes about 38%, or about 1,000,000,000 IPv4 addresses.  Comparing
   IPv6 /64 prefixes with the remainder of routable IPv4 addresses shows
   there are 11.3 million times more IPv6 /64 prefixes needing
   categorization.  In addition, there is no practical means to
   facilitate this effort.

   IP address reputation requires logging associated connections to
   permit review.  Whether describing reputations as only positive or
   only negative, errant exclusion or inclusion of either poses similar
   risk.  Tracking currently routed IPv6 /64 prefixes using a single bit
   requires 6 million billion bytes or 5,650 Terra-bytes just to track
   simple use.  Even feedback by IPv6 address prefix will expose
   mailboxes that detect subscription policy violations.

   Some also suggest there will not be a significant increase in the
   number of servers running over IPv6 and since their overall number
   should be comparable, email should still be dealing with a similar
   number of IP addresses.  Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not constrain the
   number of IP addresses assigned to a network interface.  This feature
   allows each connection from a server to originate from a different IP
   address, perhaps one for each user.  The potential increase allowed
   by IPv6 may prove explosive, even those only from good actors.

   Organizations such as M3AAWG hope to use DKIM as a required
   acceptance requirement to better ensure a domain identity offers a
   basis for acceptance to replace that of the IP address used by SMTP
   clients.  Due to the understandable IPv6 reputation services'
   inability to scale, domain based alternatives are being sought.  Some

   at least understand DKIM is unable to support negative reputation
   schemes.  Reliance on a mechanism unable to sustain close scrutiny of
   negative assertions makes sustained differentiation of positive and
   negative views less tenable.

   At this April's Rocky Mountain IPv6 Task Force summit in Denver, the
   second day government track sessions raised concerns about there
   being no means available to defend SMTP over IPv6.  There are
   proposals within the IETF aimed at establishing DKIM as a basis for
   reputation schemes in the Repute WG (i.e. section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-repute-email-identifiers] which introduces DKIM domains
   being used along with SMTP client IP addresses and rfc5321.helo also
   identifying the SMTP client.  Identifying the SMTP client encompasses
   both "Who Initiated" and "To Whom" message elements to support fair
   negative assertions.  However, DKIM does not encompass this essential
   information.  In addition, DKIM's inability to detect invalid
   prefixed header fields also means any positive DKIM reputation
   assertion can prove highly harmful by increasing trust in possible
   deceptions.


2.  Exploiting Trust

   Trust established by a signing domain is being exploited to mislead
   recipients about who authored a message.  DKIM's trust related
   function may be generalized as better ensuring delivery to in-boxes
   as opposed to junk folders or silent discard.  It is also apparent
   receivers expect signature validation ensures invalid header fields
   have not been pre-fixed.  While it is possible for signing domains to
   support this expectation by including non-existent header fields in a
   list of those added to the signature's hash, few implement this
   feature.

   Perhaps signers consider such double listing wasteful of storage
   resources or they assume the validation process makes these checks
   without the non-intuitive double listing of header fields not
   permitted to repeat anyway.  When a domain is very large, errant
   filtering is likely to entail costly customer support which affords
   them greater latitude and who are also likely sensitive to wasting
   their storage resources.

   Regardless of possible underlying motivations, it is clear checks for
   valid message structure remains a general expectation of DKIM's
   validation process that simply does not occur.  Not every domain is
   seeking to establish the same level of trust, where those not
   checking for pre-fixed header fields having greater latitude place
   all other domains at risk.  Checking message structure is explicitly
   not to be handled by the transport.  Modification to SMTP

   implementations such as Sendmail, Exim, or Postfix and the like are
   neither appropriate, nor likely beneficial within a relevant time
   frame.

   Larger domains often obtain their size by offering relatively easy
   access.  These domains afford malefactors a simple method to have
   their deceptive messages reach their victim's in-box.  DKIM's
   validation process not explicitly ensuring against invalid repeated
   header fields together with of limited hash inclusion permitting
   abuse of other domains makes DKIM harmful.  DKIM validation MUST be
   modified to ensure against invalid repeated header fields so that
   trust established by a signing domain is not exploited to mislead
   recipients about who authored a message.


3.  Maintaining Trust

   Not every subsystem or protocol layer should be expected to repeat
   previous security checks to establish proper layering, however
   critical checks important for enforcing new relationships within a
   message should not be assumed, especially those involving a trivial
   effort.  With high levels of abuse resulting from email's open
   nature, delegating checks in a structured manner better conserves
   essential resources.  However, email's highly distributed store and
   forward protocol could not function if rigid message structures were
   enforced by the transport.  Such enforcement does not scale, and may
   impede necessary change.  New authentication or presentation
   requirements may involve small structural adjustments.  For example,
   internationalization introduced a format negotiation not assured to
   survive beyond the next hop.


4.  Responding to Defects and Exploitation

   As with aviation, the success of email has risen to great heights.
   As within the world of aviation, faults threatening security, that
   when discovered, demand our attention and diligence to effect repair.
   Email has become an integral component in general commerce and the
   maintenance of security such as reporting system failures, break-in
   attempts, and facilitating account access recovery.

   Reporting or predicting failure should not be viewed as exhibiting a
   lack of respect for achieved accomplishments.  Noting and repairing
   faults only signify the importance of email's prominent role.  As
   with most security related protocols, responding to noted defects is
   fairly common.  Not responding to discovered defects in a security
   related protocol would be shocking.  Simply publishing this draft
   appears to have already increase the level of multiple FROM header

   field abuse seen where it is now at 21% of signed DKIM messages.


5.  Conflating DKIM Fragments with Email Messages

   DKIM signs only fragments of an email message, so it is more proper
   to refer to "DKIM Signed Fragments", and not "DKIM Signed Messages".
   Normal DKIM signature validation offers a simple PASS/FAIL
   associating it with a specific domain.  When a recipient receives a
   PASS status, only the last FROM header field message fragment is
   ensured to have been included in the DKIM signature process.  Other
   message fragments, including the message body, are optional and may
   not have been included.  The FROM header field is normally visible
   UNLESS there are multiple FROM header fields.  In which case, the
   signed FROM header field fragment is likely invisible, as is the DKIM
   signature fragments that hide which other message fragments had been
   encompassed by the DKIM signature process.

   DKIM's trust related role is to better ensure message delivery to a
   user's in-box.  Unless DKIM ensures this trust is not used to
   perpetrate deception, no positive assertions regarding a DKIM domain
   is safe.  As a result, DKIM can not be used with either positive or
   negative reputation assertions in its current form.

   The FROM header field is the Author identifier in section 11.1 of
   [I-D.kucherawy-dmarc-base].  The DMARC specification offers normative
   language that a message SHOULD be rejected when multiple FROM header
   fields are detected.  This requirement would not be necessary or
   impose protocol layer violations if DKIM did not offer valid
   signature results when repeated header fields violate [RFC5322].
   [RFC5322] declaring a message structure invalid does not preclude the
   occurrence of invalid messages, and [RFC5321] clearly states it will
   not enforce [RFC5322] message structure due to practical constraints.
   Instead of relying on optional policies such as DMARC that make
   partial guesses that ignore DATE or SUBJECT spoofing for example,
   critical violations of the message structure that pertain to
   enhancing trust can be enforced by DKIM simply defining the
   associated signatures invalid.  Unlike DMARC, proper signature
   definition does not cross protocol layers, especially since no other
   layer enforces [RFC5322].

   Since multiple DKIM signatures can occur, simple annotation of which
   fragments and domains associate with a valid signature is precluded.
   The ONLY message fragment ensured by a DKIM signature is the FROM
   header field.  Just as DMARC concluded only the FROM header field is
   closely observed by recipients, DKIM initially reached this
   conclusion as well.  While no absolute assurance of header field
   validity is asserted, the domain together with it's reputation



Otis & Rand             Expires December 6, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                DKIM-HARMFUL                     June 2013


   permits recipients to increase their trust in what is observed in the
   FROM header field.  This trust further increases when the DKIM domain
   is authoritative for the FROM header field domain.

   When acceptance is predicated on the DKIM signature, as occurs with
   DMARC, preserving trust associated with the FROM header field in
   conjunction with the DKIM domain is destroyed whenever multiple FROM
   header fields are permitted by not invalidating these DKIM
   signatures.  DMARC over reaches when rejecting email based upon
   message format as with [RFC6854] group syntax in the FROM header
   field.  DMARC should not be required to second guess whether a DKIM
   signature is valid.


6.  SMTP Can't

   SMTP [RFC5321] recommends against rejecting messages based upon
   perceived defects in the message structure.  This liberal acceptance
   permits evolutionary change in message specifications starting at
   [RFC0822] that was based on [RFC0733] replaced by [RFC2822] and again
   by [RFC5322], [RFC6152], [RFC6532], and [RFC6854]; the second to last
   paragraph in section 3 of [RFC5321] provides a definitive statement
   messages should not be rejected due to perceived defects in the
   [RFC0822] message structure.  The initial reference to [RFC0822] in
   this paragraph offers two foot notes with the second referencing the
   latest version of [RFC0822] which is [RFC5322] which itself has
   recently been updated.  The impact of initially removing text
   specifically indicating which header fields are not to repeat is
   unknown.  This information was implied within the then-new ABNF
   notation.  Clarifying text for this requirement did not return until
   the [RFC0822] revision 19 years later which also indicates this
   specification's success at providing a foundation that allowed email
   to flourish.

   There are many SMTP servers that have been in operation for decades
   with years passing between security patches.  Such an accomplishment
   is most remarkable considering the volume of traffic being handled,
   often from highly malicious sources.  This amazing stability and
   scalability with high levels of security would not have been possible
   if SMTP had been expected to validate message formats.

   Expecting SMTP to validate message formats to protect against
   vulnerabilities pertaining to protocols such as DKIM does not scale.
   The general use of DKIM permits signature checks subsequent to
   acceptance where only the status of signatures determines internal
   placement.  As such, it becomes critical to ensure a DKIM signature
   is never declared valid having malformed header field stacks.  To
   accomplish this, the DKIM specification must change.

7.  DKIM Vulnerability

   DKIM permits a vulnerability by not checking the message header field
   stack for invalid repeats when signing or verifying a signature.  The
   DKIM signature process must walk both down and then up the header
   field stack while selecting the header fields to be included in the
   hash process of the signature.  The DKIM process will even ignore
   prefixed FROM header fields which is the only header field always
   included.

   The WG concluded that "listing non-existent header fields as signed"
   hack added in non-normative language together with opinions that
   checking for invalid repeated header fields is not to be considered
   DKIM's problem.  See section 8.15 of [RFC6376] where this issue was
   expressed as not an attack against the trust DKIM intends to convey,
   and thus not a concern for DKIM.  Nevertheless, improperly formed
   messages may display only the first of multiple header fields that,
   as a result of erroneous assumptions of there being no invalid
   repeated header fields, the prefixed header fields are likely to be
   displayed in lieu of those signed while not impacting DKIM's
   signature validity.

   DKIM incorrectly assumed the header field stack's starting condition,
   which DKIM itself is best able to determine, and is an option in the
   OpenDKIM implementation.  This is likely to astonish most recipients
   that DKIM failed to make a robust effort to maintain the trust it is
   attempting to convey.  Three members of the WG authored proposed
   changes aimed specifically at addressing this issue [DKIM-MH-Attack].
   At the time, some expressed concerns about whether this might set
   back DKIM's standardization process.  As such, DKIM Signers may sign
   malformed messages (e.g., violate [RFC5322]) and be in compliance
   with DKIM specifications.  In addition, receivers may verify these
   messages as having valid signatures despite multiple instances of a
   header field only permitted to occur once and also be in compliance
   with DKIM specifications.  See addendum for examples of the possible
   abuse permitted.

   Use of DKIM on such messages exposes a vulnerability in the
   evaluation process.  Rather than ensuring essential checks are made
   prior to producing a result, a wasteful hack was later suggested
   where extra non-existent header fields could be included in the list
   of signed header fields.  Any pre-pended header field added after
   signing would thereby change resulting hashes and invalidate the
   signature.  Not all domains are attempting to achieve the same level
   of trust and may be more sensitive to incurring incremental storage
   requirements.  Some domains may even inadvertently sign invalid
   repeated header fields because this check had not been required in
   the DKIM process.  These same DKIM domains are also likely to

Internet-Draft                DKIM-HARMFUL                     June 2013


   establish themselves as being Too Big To Block.  These TBTB domains
   can then be used to spoof other domains that may have otherwise
   established a high level of trust by implementing the hack where, due
   to this defect in DKIM, can still do nothing in their defense from
   the perspective of now deceived recipients.

   This vulnerability in DKIM represents an exploit allowing serious
   attacks caused by erroneous assumptions made in DKIM's signature
   process.  There is also a header field, which because of its label,
   may potentially mislead recipients into believing it contains valid
   "Authentication-Results" [RFC5451].  Common phrases such as
   "Authentication-Results", "pass", and "fail", rather than use of
   result codes belies introductory claims this header is not intended
   for direct human consumption.


8.  Barriers to an Authenticated Domain

   Some advocate use of DKIM as a means to obtain domain references
   based on the increased prevalence of this protocol.  DKIM is
   independent of the domain actually sending the message and the
   recipient by design.  Unfortunately, DKIM also does not attempt to
   protect against likely abuses that are also beyond the control of the
   signing domain in which DKIM signature validity conveys no assurance
   pre-fixed header fields have not changed what recipients see.  As
   such, DKIM signing domains can not be held accountable for incidents
   of abuse appearing to violate subscription policies or that spoof
   other domains.

   Because of DKIM's vulnerability to header field spoofing, it would
   not be safe to express positive reputations either.  Any such
   assurance could be exploited by malefactors to deceive those trusting
   DKIM results.  In short, a DKIM signed domain as currently defined,
   can not be safely used in any context, other than the most rigid
   exclusion of any unsigned content which is well beyond any existing
   implementation.  DKIM can not be safely used for email reputation as
   currently defined.


9.  Domains as a Basis for Managing Traffic

   A manageable basis for assessments can leverage a smaller number of
   related domains, compared to IPv6 or even IPv4 addresses.  Although
   technically the domain name space can be larger than the massively
   large IPv6 address space, in practice it is not.  One hundred
   thousand domains control 90% of Internet traffic out of approximately
   100 million domains active each month.  The top 150 domains control
   50% of the traffic, and the top 2,500 domains control 75%.  This

Internet-Draft                DKIM-HARMFUL                     June 2013


   level of domain consolidation permits effective fast-path white-
   listing.  Improvements achieved using domains to consolidate the
   threat landscape can easily justify added cryptographic
   authentication burdens.  Even APL resource records [RFC3123] can
   authenticate EHLO using a single DNS transaction, but this would not
   allow IPv6 email to be more easily managed when facing extensive use
   of transitional technologies such as ISATAP, Teredo, 6to4, NAT64, and
   DNS64, which cryptographic technology can offer.


10.  XMPP Shows the Way Forward

   In addition to SMTP [RFC5321] using StartTLS [RFC3207] XMPP [RFC6122]
   uses StartTLS [RFC6120] over a different port with many of the
   features used by web servers such as [RFC2560] as one means to
   increase scalability.  It seems plausible that by defining SMTP
   access over a different port is where a new authentication and
   international requirements can be resolved together.  Of course, port
   25 can be used where it might require StartTLS in the case of IPv6
   connections.

   Many administrators overlook a serious problem made much worse by
   chatty protocols that impose processing delays.  Examining server
   logs will not reveal any problem either, because the limited resource
   being consumed is the number of outstanding connections TCP is able
   to support.  Reaching this limit will prevent new connections from
   being instantiated but this is not logged as an event.  Over time
   administrators may hear complaints email is not being delivered or
   just see an ever growing percentage of spam.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA consideration.


12.  Security Considerations

   This draft intends to describe serious security concerns raised with
   use of DKIM that is exacerbated with IPv6 email.  The contained
   recommendations are expected to reduce these security concerns.  To
   better ensure security, the DKIM specification must change.

   Recommendations [DKIM-MH-Attack] rejected by the DKIM WG were aimed
   at repairing this defect by simply requiring the definition for a
   valid DKIM signature to ensure no invalid repeated header fields are
   present.  It is also clear that the non-normative language describing
   the non-intuitive approach of listing non-existent header fields has

   not been widely embraced, especially by the domains sensitive to
   storage requirements.  The overall storage requirement was one of
   weighing factors in selecting between IIM and DKIM.  IIM's inclusion
   of the public key within the message was considered an unnecessary
   waste of storage.  It seems many also consider the prophylactic
   listing of non-existent header fields an unnecessary waste as well.
   Based upon the current data, the present DKIM specification did not
   result in something that can retain trust, and that ultimately leads
   to even greater protocol layer violations.
