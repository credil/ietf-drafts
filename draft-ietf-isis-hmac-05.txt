This document describes the authentication of Intermediate System to
Intermediate System (IS-IS) Protocol Data Units (PDUs) using the
Hashed Message Authentication Codes - Message Digest 5 (HMAC-MD5)
algorithm as found in RFC 2104.  IS-IS is specified in International
Standards Organization (ISO) 10589, with extensions to support
Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) described in RFC 1195.  The base
specification includes an authentication mechanism that allows for
multiple authentication algorithms.  The base specification only
specifies the algorithm for cleartext passwords.

This document proposes an extension to that specification that
allows the use of the HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm to be used in
conjunction with the existing authentication mechanisms.

This document is a product of IS-IS for IP Internets Working Group of
the IETF.
