This document defines a basic set of requirements for reliable server
pooling.

The goal of Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) is to develop an
architecture and protocols for the management and operation of server
pools supporting highly reliable applications, and for client access
mechanisms to a server pool.

This document is a product of the Reliable Server Pooling Working
Group of the IETF.
