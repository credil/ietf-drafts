 Abstract

     This document enhances the mobility of Mobile node's home agent
     (HAMN) and correspondence node's home agent (HACN) along with
     the mobility of Mobile Node (MN) and Correspondence Node (CN).
     Hence this document shows true and complete mobility of
     MobileIPv6 protocol.

Internet-Draft               True mobility                 October 2011


1. Introduction


   In recent years user's data requirement has rapidly increased as
   compared to past. This data requirement is mostly fulfilled by
   Internet.Previously user was using wired technology to connect with
   Internet.With the advancement in the field of wireless and Internet
   technology,people have started using wireless devices.These wireless
   device also supports user mobility. MobileIP is an Internet
   Engineering Task Force(IETF) standard communications protocol that
   is designed to allow mobile device users to move from one network
   to another while maintaining a permanent IP address.

   The MobileIP has several entities like MN, CN,HAMN and HACN.
   The Mobile IP protocol allows location-independent routing of IP
   datagram on the Internet. Each mobile node is identified by its home
   address and not by its current location in the Internet. While
   away from its home network, a mobile node is associated with a
   care-of-address which identifies its current location and its home
   address is associated with the local endpoint of a tunnel to its
   home agent. MobileIP specifies how a mobile node registers with its
   home agent and how the home agent routes datagram to the mobile node
   through the tunnel.

   Mobile IP for IPv4 (MIPv4)is described in IETF RFC 3344,and updates
   are added in IETF RFC 4721.MobileIPv4 is a derivative protocol of
   IPv4 RFC 791.As IPv4 protocol has only 32 bit of address space so
   it can accommodate only limited number of IP addresses. Hence same
   problem is faced by MIPv4 protocol. Secondly MIPv4 was not having
   route optimization procedure which was later updated in RFC 4721.
   Another version of IP introduced through RFC 2460.This new IP
   protocol is known as IPv6 which has 128 bit of address space. With
   this amount of address space it is possible to allocate separate IP
   address to a single user's multiple devices.Mobility for IPv6 is
   defined in RFC 3775 called as MobileIPv6.

   RFC3344 and RFC3775 assumes that home agent is a stationary router.
   Hence home agents do not change its location with respect to time.
   This document assumes that home agent is a mobile router.Therefore
   a mobile router can changes its position with time.

   This document enhances the mobility of HAMN,HACN along with the
   mobility of MN and CN.Therefore this document shows true mobility
   of MIPv6 protocol.How does a HAMN,HACN maintain  their connection
   with MN,CN is out of scope of this document.

3. Various scenarios of Mobility

    scenario 1: When all entities are stationary

     This is the case where all the entities are stationary. The MN
     is connected to its Home agent HAMN with its home link and CN is
     connected to its own home agent HACN in home link. This is a very
     normal case and has been discussed in RFC 3775.

          MN Network                                  CN Network

    scenario 2: when MN is mobile and HAMN,CN,HACN are stationary
     In this case the MN has became mobile and connected to a new
     foreign network through foreign link. The rest of the
     entities like HAMN, CN and HACN are stationary to their positions.

     This is the case when both MN and CN are mobile but HAMN,HACN are
     stationary. The MN becomes mobile and attached to a foreign

 4.  Security Considerations

      This draft shows the various scenarios when home agent is a
      mobile router.In cases of 3.1,3.2,3.3,3.4 the security asso-
      ciation will be as defined by RFC [3775]. For rest of the
      mobility cases an entirely new security mechanism or a modified
      version of IPSec can be defined.

      As all the previously defined security mechanismlike IPSec
      considered router to be a stationary device.In this document
      we assumed that home agent(HAMN,HACN)is a mobile router.Due to
      router's mobility security is an issue of concern.In RFC3775
      authentication like key exchangeof MN,CN were possible because
      of stationary router.Once the router itself become mobile and
      changes its location with respect to time so the authentication
      of MN,CN can not be executed properly.Due to mobility router it
      self having various kinds of security issues.Hence there is a
      need to revise all the security mechanism stated so far to
      support router mobility.

 5.  Asumptions

    5.1.HAMN,HACN is a mobile router.
    5.2.Foreign network whic is visited by MN,HAMN,CN or HACN may be
        same or maybe different.
    5.3.How does a HAMN,HACN maintain their connection with MN,CN is out
        of the scope of this document.


 6.  IANA Considerations
