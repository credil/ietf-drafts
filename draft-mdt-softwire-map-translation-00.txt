2.  Introduction

   Experiences from several years of IPv6 deployment [RFC6219] indicates
   that transitioning a service providers' domain fully to IPv6-only
   requires not only the continued support of legacy IPv4 communication
   across that domain, but also the need for an ultimate IPv4 exit
   strategy allowing communication between IPv4 and IPv6 address
   families in that domain.  The use of an IPv4/IPv6 translation based
   solution is an optimal way to address these requirements,
   particularly in combination with stateless translation techniques
   that seek to minimize complexities as described in
   [I-D.operators-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation].  The double Pv4/
   IPv6 translation based solution, MAP-T, is such a solution, and one
   that builds on existing stateless IPv4/IPv6 address translation
   techniques specified in [RFC6052], [RFC6144], and [RFC6145], by:

   o Extending stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with algorithmic address
   and port mapping rules as defined in MAP MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].

   o Introducing the notion of stateless double IPv4/IPv6 translation
   that can restore the original IPv4 address.

   o Allowing IPv4-translatable addresses to be either fully or
   partially encoded in IPv6 prefixes (or addresses) assigned to
   customers.

   The MAP-T solution presents an operator with the prospect of a full
   transition of a domain to IPv6-only, in a manner that:

Internet-Draft               Map Translation                January 2012


   o  Retains the ability for IPv4 end hosts to communicate across the
      IPv6 domain with other IPv4 hosts.

   o  Permits both individual IPv4 address assignment as well as IPv4
      address sharing with predefined port range to be enacted using
      IPv6.

   o  Allows communication between IPv4-only, as well as any IPv6
      enabled end hosts, to native IPv6-only servers in the domain that
      are using IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.

   o  Does not require the operation of an IPv4 overlay network, nor the
      introduction of non native-IPv6 network device or server
      functionality.

   o  Allows the use of IPv6 native network operations, including the
      ability to classify IP traffic, as well as to perform IP traffic
      routing optimization policies, e.g. routing optimization based on
      peering policies for Internet IPv4 destinations outside of the
      domain.


3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Terminology

   MAP-T:                Mapping of Address and Port - Translation mode.
                         MAP-T utilizes IPv4/IP6 translation as per
                         [RFC6145] along with the MAP extensions for
                         mapping between IPv4 and IPv6 defined in MAP
                         [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port] and
                         this draft.

   MAP-T domain (Domain):  A set of MAP-T CEs and BRs,.  A service
                         provider may deploy MAP-T with a single MAP-T
                         domain, or may utilize multiple MAP-T domains.
                         Each domain requires a separate MAP-T rule set.

   MAP-T Border Relay (BR):  A MAP-T enabled router/translator at the
                         edge of a MAP-T domain, providing connectivity
                         to the MAP-T domain.  A Border Relay router has
                         at least an IPv6- enabled interface and an IPv4
                         interface connected to the native IPv4 network,

                         and it can serve multiple MAP-T domains.

   MAP-T Customer Edge (CE):  A router/translator node functioning as a
                         Customer Edge Router/translator in a MAP-T
                         domain.  This type of device is sometimes
                         referred to as a "Residential Gateway" (RG) or
                         "Customer Premises Equipment" (CPE).  A typical
                         MAP-T CE adopting MAP rules will serve a
                         residential site with one WAN side interface,
                         one or more LAN side interfaces.  A MAP-T CE
                         may also be referred to simply as a "CE" within
                         the context of MAP-T.

   Shared IPv4 address:  An IPv4 address that is shared among multiple
                         MAP CE nodes.  Each node has a separate part of
                         the transport layer port space.

   MAP-T Rule:           A MAP rule defining the mapping relationship
                         for a given MAP-T domain between IPv4 and IPv6,
                         defined in MAP

   The MAP-T solution relies on IPv4/IPv6 translating components, the
   MAP-T CE and MAP-T BR, connected to a MAP-T domain.  The MAP-T CE is
   responsible for connecting a users' private IPv4, along with any
   native IPv6 network to the IPv6-only MAP-T domain.  To multiplex
   multiple IPv4 user hosts, the CE relies on regular NAT44
   functionality, which is however configured based on MAP-T settings.
   The CE's stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation function [RFC6145], again
   configured to operate based on MAP-T settings, completes the model of
   the CE defined in Figure 1.  The CE's MAP-T domain facing interface
   is configured with a regular operator assigned IPv6 prefix that can
   be the same as that used to address any native IPv6 (non MAP-T) user
   network devices i.e.  MAP-T does not require more than one IPv6
   prefix per user network, and supports regular IPv6 prefix or address
   assignment mechanism including SLAAC and DHCPv6 stateful.

   The MAP-T BR is responsible for connecting external IPv4 networks to
   all devices in one or more MAP-T domains, using stateless IPv4/IPv6
   translation [RFC6145]extended by the MAP-T rules as per this

   document.  Besides the CE and BR, the MAP-T domain can contain any
   regular IPv6-only hosts/servers that have an IPv4 mapped IPv6 address
   (IPv4-translatable address per [RFC6052]) using a prefix assigned to
   the MAP-T domain.  Communication with such devices is naturally
   possible using native IPv6 means from inside or outside the domain as
   well as from any IPv4-only hosts inside or outside of the MAP-T
   domain.

   The IPv4 in IPv6 address mapping scheme employed by the MAP-T
   solution, along with the avoidance of using any additional
   encapsulating headers allows the MAP-T domain to be operated using
   regular native IPv6 functionality.  This includes also the ability to
   classify traffic based on specific source and destination addresses
   (including any IPv4 in IPv6 mapped source and destinations), and
   higher layer packet payload.  Similarly, the address mapping
   characteristic allows IPv6 traffic forwarding in the MAP-T domain to
   be optimized in line with an operators' policies, e.g. native IPv6
   routing selection of MAP-T domain egress points based on peering
   policies bound to IPv4 destination.  IP Traffic between CEs in any
   MAP-T can flow either in hub & spoke modes, with a BR acting as the
   spoke, or in mesh mode directly between the CEs.


6.  MAP-T Node Behavior

6.1.  Provisioning of MAP-T CE

   A MAP-T CE requires the following parameters for provisioning:

   o The MAP Domain IPv4 and IPv6 prefix, and their lengths (Basic
   Mapping Rule)

   o The MAP EA-bits (CE index), including IPv4 suffix, length and any
   port-range (including any excluded ports and the port number
   continuity parameter)

   o The BR prefix and its length (Default Mapping Rule)

   A MAP-T CE that receives a MAP DHCP option
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option] for BMR, FMR and DMR and performs
   the following (MAP initialization) functions:

   o Configures the NAT44 port-range mapping function parameters (BMR)

   o Configures the IPv4/IPv6 stateless translation parameters (BMR, FMR
   and DMR)

   Based on the above configuration, the IPv4/IPv6 translation functions

Internet-Draft               Map Translation                January 2012


   can be performed by the CE.

   o Derive IPv4 address along with any applicable port-range from IPv4-
   translatable address (BMR)

   o Derive IPv4-translatable address from IPv4 address (BMR)

   o Derive IPv4-converted address from IPv4 address (FMR and DMR)

   o Derive IPv4 address from IPv4-converted address (FMR and DMR)

6.2.  Packet Forwarding Behavior of MAP-T CE

6.2.1.  IPv4 to IPv6

   A MAP-T CE receiving IPv4 packets SHOULD perform NAT44 function first
   and create appropriate NAT44 stateful bindings.  The resulting IPv4
   packets MUST contain the source IPv4 address and source transport
   number defined by MAP-T.  The resulting IPv4 packet is forwarded to
   the CE's MAP-T function that performs IPv4 to IPv6 stateless
   translation.  The IPv6 source and destination addresses MUST then be
   derived as per Section 6 of this draft, and the IPv4 header MUST be
   replaced with an IPv6 header following [RFC6145].

6.2.2.  IPv6 to IPv4

   A MAP-T CE receiving an IPv6 packet performs its regular IPv6
   operations, whereby only packets that are addressed to the MAP-T CE's
   MAP derived BMR address are forwarded to the CE's MAP-T function.
   All other IPv6 traffic is forwarded as per the CE's IPv6 routing
   rules.  The CE SHOULD check that MAP-T received packets' transport-
   layer destination port number is in the range configured by MAP for
   the CE and the CE SHOULD drop any non conforming packet and respond
   with an ICMPv6 "Address Unreachable" (Type 1, Code 3).  In other
   cases, the MAP-T function MUST derive the IPv4 source and destination
   addresses as per Section 6 of this draft and MUST replace the IPv6
   header with an IPv4 header in accordance with [RFC6052].  The
   resulting IPv4 packet is then forwarded to the CE's NAT44 function
   where the destination port number MUST be checked against the
   stateful port mapping session table and the destination port number
   MUST be mapped to its original value.

6.3.  Provisioning of MAP-T BR

   The MAP-T BR needs to be provisioned with information for the MAP-T
   domain or domains it is expected to handle, along with any necessary
   routing processes.  For each MAP-T domain, the BR will have the

6.4.  Packet Forwarding Behavior on MAP-T BR

6.4.1.  IPv6 to IPv4

   A MAP-T BR receiving IPv6 packets selects a best matching MAP-T
   domain rule based on a longest address match of the packets' source
   address against the BR's configured MAP-T BMR prefix(es), as well as
   a match of the packet destination address against the configured BR
   prefixes or FMR prefix(es).  The selected MAP rule allows the BR to
   determine the CE-index from the source IPv6 address.  The BR MUST
   perform a validation of the consistency of the source IPv6 address
   and source port number for the packet using BMR.  If the packets
   source port number is found to be outside the range allowed for this
   CE-index and the BMR, the BR MUST drop the packet and respond with an
   ICMPv6 "Destination Unreachable, Source address failed ingress/egress
   policy" (Type 1, Code 5).

   For packets that are to be forwarded outside of a MAP-T domain, the
   BR MUST derive the source and destination IPv4 addresses as per
   Section 6 of this draft and translate the IPv6 to IPv4 headers
   following [RFC6145].  The resulting IPv4 packets are then passed to

   regular IPv4 forwarding.

6.4.2.  IPv4 to IPv6

   A MAP-T BR receiving IPv4 packets uses a longest match IPv4 lookup to
   select the target MAP-T domain and rule.  The BR MUST then derive the
   IPv6 source and destination addresses from the IPv4 source and
   destination address and port as per Section 6 of this draft.
   Following this, the BR MUST translate the IPv4 to IPv6 headers
   following [RFC6145].  The resulting IPv6 packets are then passed to
   regular IPv6 forwarding.

   Note that the operation of a BR when forwarding to MAP-T domains that
   do not utilize IPv4 address sharing, is the same as stateless IPv4/
   IPv6 translation [RFC6145].


7.  P-T IPv4/IPv6 Translation Specifications

7.1.  Address Formats

   The (mapped) CE address format used is shown in Figure 2 format and
   is as defined in MAP [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  It
   is used in both BMR and FMR operation

7.2.  Translating IPv4 Address and Port Number into IPv6 Address and
      Port Number at the BR

   IPv6 Source Address and Source Port Number:

   At the BR, the IPv6 source address (IPv4-converted address) MUST be
   derived from the IPv4 source Address as per DMR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  The source Layer 4 port
   number MUST be unchanged.

   IPv6 Destination Address and Destination Port Number:

   At the BR, the IPv6 destination address (IPv4-translatable address)
   MUST be derived from the IPv4 destination address and the destination
   port number as per FMR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  The destination port
   number MUST be unchanged.

7.3.  Translating IPv6 Address and Port Number into IPv4 Address and
      Port Number at the BR

   IPv4 Source Address and Source Port Number:

   At the BR, the IPv4 source address MUST be derived from the IPv6
   source address (IPv4-translatable address) as per BMR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  The source port number
   MUST be unchanged.

   IPv4 Destination Address and Destination Port Number:

   At the BR, the IPv4 destination address MUST be derived from the IPv6
   destination address (IPv4-converted address) as per DBR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  The destination port
   number MUST be unchanged.

7.4.  Translating IPv4 Address and Port Number into IPv6 Address and
      Port Number at the CE

   IPv6 Source Address and Source Port Number:

   At the CE, the IPv6 source address (IPv4-translatable address) MUST
   be derived from the IPv4 source address as per BMR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  The source port number
   MUST be unchanged.

   IPv6 Destination Address and Destination Port Number:

   At the CE, if Forwarding Mapping Rules (FMRs) are enabled, the IPv4

Internet-Draft               Map Translation                January 2012


   packet MUST be checked to see if the IPv4 destination address matches
   the FMR.  If matching, the IPv6 destination address (IPv4-converted
   address) MUST be derived from the IPv4 destination address and the
   destination port number per FMR.  Otherwise, the IPv6 destination
   address (IPv4-converted address) MUST be derived from the received
   IPv4 destination address per DMR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  The destination port
   number MUST be unchanged.

7.5.  Translating IPv6 Address and Port Number into IPv4 Address and
      Port Number at the CE

   IPv4 Source Address and Source Port Number:

   At the CE, the IPv4 source address MUST be derived from the IPv6
   source address (IPv6-converted address) as per FMR or DMR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  The source port number
   MUST be unchanged.

   IPv4 Destination Address and Destination Port Number: At the CE, the
   IPv4 destination address MUST be derived from the IPv6 destination
   address (IPv6-translatable address) as per BMR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  The source port number
   MUST be unchanged.

7.6.  Translating ICMP/ICMPv6 Headers

   MAP-T CEs and BRs MUST follow ICMP/ICMPv6 translation as per
   [RFC6145], with the following extension to cover the address sharing/
   port-range feature.

   Unlike TCP and UDP, which each provide two port fields to represent
   both source and destination, the ICMP/ICMPv6 Query message header has
   only one ID field [RFC0792], [RFC4443].  Thus, if the ICMP Query
   message is originated from an IPv4 host behind a MAP-T CE, the ICMP
   ID field SHOULD be used to exclusively identify that IPv4 host.  This
   means that the MAP-T CE SHOULD rewrite the ID field to a port-set
   value obtained via the BMR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port] during the IPv4 to IPv6
   translation per [RFC6145].  The BR will translate the ICMPv6 packets
   back to ICMP per [RFC6145].  When MAP-T BR receives an ICMP packet
   containing an ID field which is bound for a shared address in the
   MAP-T domain, the MAP-T BR SHOULD use the ID value as a substitute
   for the destination port in determining the IPv6 destination address
   according to Section 5.1 and per [RFC6145].  In all other cases, the
   MAP-T BR MUST derive the destination IPv6 address by simply mapping
   the destination IPv4 address without additional port info per
   [RFC6145].  The corresponding CE will translate the ICMPv6 packets



Bao, et al.               Expires July 13, 2012                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               Map Translation                January 2012


   back to ICMP per [RFC6145].

7.7.  Path MTU Discovery and Fragmentation

   Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, which are 20+
   octets and 40 octets respectively, handling the maximum packet size
   is relevant for the operation of any system connecting the two
   address families.  There are three mechanisms to handle this issue:
   path MTU discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and transport-layer
   negotiation such as the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) option
   [RFC0897].  MAP-T uses all three mechanisms to deal with different
   cases.

   Following [RFC6145], when an IPv4 node performs path MTU discovery
   (by setting the Don't Fragment (DF) bit in the header), path MTU
   discovery can operate end-to-end across the MAP-T BR and CE
   translators.  In this case, either IPv4 or IPv6 routers (including
   the translators) can send back ICMP Packet Too Big messages to the
   sender.  When IPv6 routers send these as ICMPv6 errors, these packets
   following [RFC6145] will pass through the translator and will result
   in an appropriate ICMP error sent to the IPv4 sender.  When the IPv4
   sender does not set the DF bit, the translator MUST ensure that the
   packet does not exceed the path MTU on the IPv6 side.  This is done,
   if necessary, by fragmenting the IPv4 packet and including with
   Fragment Headers to fit in the minimum MTU 1280-byte IPv6 packets.
   When the IPv4 sender does not set the DF bit, the translator SHOULD
   always include an IPv6 Fragment Header to indicate that the sender
   allows fragmentation.  The rules defined in [RFC6145] ensure that
   when packets are fragmented, either by the sender or by IPv4 routers,
   the low-order 16 bits of the fragment identification are carried end-
   to-end, ensuring that packets are correctly reassembled.  The above
   mechanism ensures that the Don't Fragment (DF) bit in the IPv4 header
   can be carried end-to-end via double stateless translation in most of
   the cases.  For example, the IPv4 packets with DF=1 will be
   translated to IPv6 packets without fragmentation header and will be
   translated back to IPv4 packets with DF=1.  The IPv4 packets with
   DF=0 will be translated to IPv6 packets with fragmentation header
   (keeping the ID value) and will be translated back to IPv4 packets
   with DF=0.  A corner case is for IPv4 packets with DF=1 and MF=1.  In
   this case, IPv4 packets with DF=1 and MF=1 will be translated to IPv6
   packets with a fragmentation header which will see them translated
   back to IPv4 packets with DF=0.  Experimental evidence [operational-
   exp] indicates that IPv4 packets with DF=1 and MF=1 are rare in
   production networks (10e-5) and that their handling by MAP-T devices
   causes no negative effects in practice.

8.  MAP-T Packet Forwarding considerations

8.1.  Mesh Model

   MAP-T allows the use of the mesh model in order for all CEs to
   communicate with each other directly (i.e bypassing the BR).  When a
   CE receives an IPv4 packet from its LAN side, the CE looks up a
   mapping rule corresponding to an IPv4 destination address in the
   received IPv4 packet.  If the corresponding mapping rule is found, CE
   can communicate to another CE directly based on the mapping rule
   defined as Forwarding mapping rule (FMR) in MAP MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].  If the corresponding
   mapping rule is not found, CE must forward the packet to a given BR.

8.2.  Hub & Spoke model

   In order to allow the mesh topology so that all CEs can communicate
   each others directly, all CE should know all mapping rules applied to
   a given MAP-T domain or MAP-T domains.  However, if a CE knows only a
   subset of the mapping rules applied to a given MAP-T domain, a CE can
   not communicate directly with some of the CEs in that domain due to
   the lack of mapping rules.  In this case, an IPv4 packet toward to
   these CEs must be forwarded to a given BR.  In order to achieve the
   hub & spoke mode fully, the Forwarding mapping rule (FMR) defined in
   MAP MAP [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port] need to be
   disabled (not defined).

8.3.  Communication with IPv6 servers in the MAP-T domain

   MAP-T allows communication between both IPv4-only and any IPv6
   enabled end hosts, with native IPv6-only servers which are using
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address based on DMR in the MAP-T domain.  In this
   mode, the IPv6-only servers SHOULD have both A and AAAA records in
   the authorities DNS server [RFC6219].  DNS64 [RFC6147] become
   required only when IPv6 servers in the MAP-T domain are expected
   themselves to initiate communication to external IPv4-only hosts.


9.  NAT44 considerations

   The NAT44 implemented in MAP-T CE SHOULD conform with the behavior
   and best current practice documented in [RFC4787], [RFC5508] and
   [RFC5382].  In MAP-T address sharing mode (determined by the MAP-T
   configuration parameters) the operation of the NAT44 must be
   restricted to the available port numbers derived via BMR MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port]

10.  Security Considerations

   Spoofing attacks:  With consistency checks between IPv4 and IPv6
      sources that are performed on IPv4/IPv6 packets received by BR's
      and CE's (Section 6), MAP-T does not introduce any opportunity for
      spoofing attack that would not pre-exist in IPv6.

   Denial-of-service attacks:  In MAP-T domains where IPv4 addresses are
      shared, the fact that IPv4 datagram reassembly may be necessary
      introduces an opportunity for DOS attacks.  This is inherent to
      address sharing, and is common with other address sharing
      approaches such as DS-Lite and NAT64/ DNS64.  The best protection
      against such attacks is to accelerate IPv6 enablement in both
      clients and servers so that, where MAP-T is supported, it is less
      and less used.

   Routing-loop attacks:  This attack may exist in some automatic-
      tunneling scenarios are documented in
      [I-D.ietf-v6ops-tunnel-loops].  They cannot exist with MAP-T
      because each BRs checks that the IPv6 source address of a received
      IPv6 packet is a CE address based on Forwarding Mapping Rule
      defined in MAP [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port].

   Attacks facilitated by restricted port set:  From hosts that are not
      subject to ingress filtering of [RFC2827], some attacks are
      possible by intervening with faked packets during ongoing
      transport connections ([RFC4953], [RFC5961], [RFC6056].  The
      attacks depend on guessing which ports are currently used by
      target hosts, and using an unrestricted port set is preferable,
      i.e. using native IPv6 connections that are not subject to MAP
      port range restrictions.  To minimize this type of attacks when
      using a restricted port set, the MAP CE's NAT44 filtering behavior
      SHOULD be "Address-Dependent Filtering".  Furthermore, the MAP CEs
      SHOULD use a DNS transport proxy function to handle DNS traffic,
      and source such traffic from IPv6 interfaces not assigned to
      MAP-T.  Practicalities of these methods are discussed in Section
      5.9 of [I-D.dec-stateless-4v6].
