                      Carrying Big Labels in BGP-4

Abstract

   When BGP is used to distribute a particular route, it can also be
   used to distribute an MPLS label which is mapped to that route.  In
   some cases, for example, when L3VPN is used to access and connect to
   virtual networks in data centers, there may be 16 millions of VPN
   instances on a router.  In order to map MPLS labels to VPN instances,
   big labels are required.  This document specifies the method to carry
   and distribute such big labels by piggybacking the big label mapping
   information for an IP route in the BGP Update message that is used to
   distribute the route itself.

1.  Introduction

   Network virtualization and server virtualization are being designed
   and deployed in data center networks, and new data encapsulation
   methods and protocols are being defined and specified, for example,
   VXLAN, NVGRE and NVO3.  The general idea is to add a new virtual
   network header so that a physical network can be used to support
   millions (16M) of virtualized overlaid networks.  Network overlay
   virtualization have placed a new requirement on the access method to
   such virtulized networks.

   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs of [RFC2547] and [RFC4364], provide a market-proven
   technology and solution for end-to-end IP VPNs.  In BGP/MPLS IP VPNs,
   all the customer sites are connected to the service provider networks

   through PE-CE link.  It is desirable to extend the BGP/MPLS scheme so
   that customers can access their virtualized networks hosted in a data
   center by using BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.

   In the data plane of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, the customer VPN/VRF instances
   are represented by an MPLS label (VPN label) locally assgined by the
   PE connecting to CE.  Since MPLS labels are 20 bits long, a PE can
   maximally support 1 million VPNs/VRFs, but PE is required to support
   16 millions of virtual networks that are being standardized in VXLAN,
   NVGRE and NVO3.  When BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are extended to access
   virtualized networks in data centers, [I-D.draft-renwei-l3vpn-big-
   label] describes several use cases and solutions to use big labels to
   represent the VPN and maps them to virtual network instances.

   The big label information mapped to VPN routes can be carried and
   distributed by BGP-4 in the framework of [RFC3107].  This document
   specifies the method to carry and distribute such big labels by
   piggybacking the big label mapping information for an IP route in the
   BGP Update message that is used to distribute the route itself.

2.  Motivation

   This document tries to make L3 VPN BGP signaling work with the MPLS
   big label specified in [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-big-label].  With the
   proposed method, the MPLS big label can be carried in BGP NLRI and
   mapped to BGP routes.

   The extension of BGP is used to connect a customer site to its
   virtualized network hosted in a data center by using, for example,
   VXLAN, NVGRE or NVO3.

   Take NVO3 as an example.  NVO3 is an on-going effort to standardize
   solutions to data center virtualizaiton with the goal of providing
   viable data encapsulation and protocols across a scaling range of a
   few thousand VMs to several million VMs running on greater than one
   hundred thousand physical servers.  NVO3 considers approaches to
   multi-tenancy that reside at the network layer rather than using
   traditional isolation mechanisms that rely on the underlying layer 2
   technology (e.g. VLANs).

   Based on NVO3 framework and problem statement, NVO3 will deliver 16
   million virtual networks in a physical data center.

Internet-Draft        Carrying Big Labels in BGP-4             July 2013


   Potentially, PE-NVE needs to support 16 million of VRFs.  The
   extension of BGP described in this document can be used between PE-
   NVE and PE for the purpose of association between L3VPN labels and
   network virtualizaiton instances in the NVO3 network.

3.  Big Labels

   A PE device uses VPN labels to find the associated VRFs for VPN
   packet forwarding.  When L3VPN is used to access and connect a
   virtual network hosted in a data center by using VXLAN, NVGRE or
   NVO3, a label space having a minimal set of 16 million labels is
   required.

   The document [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-big-label] specifies an encoding
   format by adding a new label value field to the common label as
   follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |            Big Label Indicator        | Exp |S|       TTL     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |            Big Label Value                                    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+




   The Big Label Indicator is a reserved MPLS label.  The currently
   unassigned reserved label range is 4-6 and 8-12.  We will temporarily
   use label 8 for big label indicator, but the final value will be
   assigned by IANA.  The Big Label Value is a 32-bit value.

   When an MPLS LSR receivs an MPLS packet, it reads out the MPLS label.
   If the MPLS label is a Big Label Indicator, it will use the
   subsequent 32-bit value as the MPLS label for the forwarding purpose.

   In what follows, we will describe how BGP-4 carries and distributes
   such big labels for IP routes.

4.  AFI/SAFI

   In BGP-4, label mapping information is carried as part of the Network
   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) in the Multiprotocol Extensions
   of BGP-4 [RFC2858].

Internet-Draft        Carrying Big Labels in BGP-4             July 2013


   The AFI indicates, as usual, the address family of the associated
   route.  The fact that the NLRI carries an MPLS big label is indicated
   by using a SAFI value, to be requested to IANA.  The SAFI value 4 is
   currently assigned for common labels.  The currently unassigned range
   is 8-63.  Before IANA assigns an official SAFI value for big labels,
   8 is temporarily used as the SAFI value to indicate that it carries
   big labels.

5.  Big Label in NLRI

   The Network Layer Reachability Information carrying big labels is
   encoded as one or more triples of the form (length, label, prefix),
   whose fields are described as follows:


         +---------------------------+
         |   Length (1 octet)        |
         +---------------------------+
         |   Label (4 octets)        |
         +---------------------------+
         |   Prefix (variable)       |
         +---------------------------+


   a.  Length: The Length field indicates the length in bits of the
       address prefix plus the label.

   b.  Label: The Label field carries a 4-octet Big Label Value of the
       big label format specified in [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-big-label].
       Note that the Big Label Indicator is not carried in NLRI;
       instead, it will be assigned by IANA.  In the data plane, when
       encoding a packet for forwarding, both the Big Label Indicator
       and Big Label Value must be encoded in the MPLS header as
       specified in [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-big-label].

   c.  Prefix: The Prefix field contains address prefixes followed by
       enough trailing bits to make the end of the field fall on an
       octet boundary.  Note that the value of trailing bits is
       irrelevant.

   All rules and restrictions applicable to the SAFI value 4 is also
   applicable to the SAFI value 8 (subject to IANA) except for the Label
   field must be 4 octets.  In particular, the following usage rules for
   SAFI value 4 also applies to the SAFI value for big labels:

   The label(s) specified for a particular route (and associated with
   its address prefix) must be assigned by the LSR which is identified
   by the value of the Next Hop attribute of the route.

Internet-Draft        Carrying Big Labels in BGP-4             July 2013


   When a BGP speaker redistributes a route, the label(s) assigned to
   that route must not be changed (except by omission), unless the
   speaker changes the value of the Next Hop attribute of the route.

   A BGP speaker can withdraw a previously advertised route (as well as
   the binding between this route and a label) by either (a) advertising
   a new route (and a label) with the same NLRI as the previously
   advertised route, or (b) listing the NLRI of the previously
   advertised route in the Withdrawn Routes field of an Update message.
   The label information carried (as part of NLRI) in the Withdrawn
   Routes field should be set to 0x800000.  (Of course, terminating the
   BGP session also withdraws all the previously advertised routes.)

6.  Capability Anouncement

   A BGP speaker that uses MP-BGP [RFC2858] to carry label mapping
   information should use the Capabilities Optional Parameter, as
   defined in [RFC2842], to inform its peers about this capability.  The
   MP_EXT Capability Code, as defined in [RFC2858], is used to advertise
   the (AFI, SAFI) pairs available on a particular connection.

   A BGP speaker should not advertise this capability to another BGP
   speaker unless there is a Label Switched Path (LSP) between the two
   speakers.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The requirements on IANA are specified in other related documents
   [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-big-label] and [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-bgp-big-
   label], which request a reserved label to represent Big Label
   Indicator and BGP capabilities for big labels.

8.  Security Considerations

   This draft does not add any additional security implications to the
   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  All existing authentication and security
   mechanisms for BGP and MPLS still apply.
