Internet-Draft            HTTP Status Code 308             February 2012


1.  Introduction

   HTTP defines a set of status codes for the purpose of redirecting a
   request to a different URI ([RFC3986]).  The history of these status
   codes is summarized in Section 7.3 of
   [draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics], which also classifies the existing
   status codes into four categories.

   The first of these categories contains the status codes 301 (Moved
   Permanently), 302 (Found), and 307 (Temporary Redirect), which can be
   classified as below:

   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
   |                                           | Permanent | Temporary |
   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
   | Allows changing the request method from   | 301       | 302       |
   | POST to GET                               |           |           |
   | Does not allow changing the request       | -         | 307       |
   | method from POST to GET                   |           |           |
   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+

   Section 7.3.8 of [draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics] states that HTTP
   does not define a permanent variant of status code 307; this
   specification adds the status code 308, defining this missing variant
   (Section 3).

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  308 Permanent Redirect

   The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any
   future references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned
   URIs.  Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically
   re-link references to the effective request URI (Section 4.3 of
   [draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging]) to one or more of the new
   references returned by the server, where possible.

   Caches MAY use a heuristic (see [draft-ietf-httpbis-p6-cache],
   Section 2.3.1.1) to determine freshness for 308 responses.

   The new permanent URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the
   response ([draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics], Section 9.5).  A
   response payload can contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink
   to the new URI(s).

Internet-Draft            HTTP Status Code 308             February 2012


4.  Deployment Considerations

   Section 4 of [draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics] requires recipients to
   treat unknown 3xx status codes the same way as status code 300
   Multiple Choices ([draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics], Section 7.3.1).
   Thus, servers will not be able to rely on automatic redirection
   happening similar to status codes 301, 302, or 307.

   Therefore, initial use of status code 308 will be restricted to cases
   where the server has sufficient confidence in the clients
   understanding the new code, or when a fallback to the semantics of
   status code 300 is not problematic.

   Note that many existing HTML-based user agents will emulate a refresh
   when encountering an HTML <meta> refresh directive.  This can be used
   as another fallback.  For example:

   Client request:

     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com


   Server response:

     HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect
     Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
     Location: http://example.com/new
     Content-Length: 454

     <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
                           "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
     <html>
        <head>
           <title>Permanent Redirect</title>
           <meta http-equiv="refresh"
                 content="0; url=http://example.com/new">
        </head>
        <body>
           <p>
              The document has been moved to
              <a href="http://example.com/new"
              >http://example.com/new</a>.

5.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations that apply to HTTP redirects apply to the
   308 status code as well (see Section 11 of
   [draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics]).

6.  IANA Considerations

   The registration below shall be added to the HTTP Status Code
   Registry (defined in Section 4.2 of [draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics]
   and located at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes>):

   +-------+--------------------+---------------------------------+
   | Value | Description        | Reference                       |
   +-------+--------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 308   | Permanent Redirect | Section 3 of this specification |
   +-------+--------------------+---------------------------------+
