    <abstract>
   <t>     The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings,     and over the past few years several approaches to a better Registration      Data Access Protocol (RDAP) have been discussed and proposed.</t>
   
   <t>Among these shortcomings, different registries operate different WHOIS services. For users
   this implies that several WHOIS queries to different registries may be necessary in order to obtain
   data for a given resource.</t>	<t>This document describes a redirection service for
   RESTful WHOIS queries.  This service allows users to query a single
   WHOIS service and be redirected to the authoritative registry.</t>

   <t>The solution implemented proposed here applies to Regional Internet
   Registries(RIRs) and Domain Name Registries(DNRs).</t>

	   <t>A user interested in obtaining registration information for a given	   number or domain resource normally uses the WHOIS service provided by the RIRs	   and DNRs.</t>		   <t>In order to avoid having to query several databases until obtaining an	   answer, some approaches have been discussed and implemented in the	   past, most notably the Joint WHOIS <xref target='lacnic-joint-whois' /> initiative. However, among	   other shortcomings, Joint WHOIS is implemented using proxies and	   server-side referrals.</t>		   <t>The RESTful approach to WHOIS services (<xref target="I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http">draft-ietf-weirds-using-http</xref>) makes it comparatively easy to	   implement client-side redirects based on normal HTTP 1.1 semantics and behavior.</t>

			redirection service and to encourage discussion on the topic of redirects in this 
			problem domain.</t>

		<section title='Loops in Redirection'>

		   <t>When redirection is used there is always the risk that bogus user-		   agents and applications or malicious user can create loops that in		   turn may become Denial of Service attacks.</t>				   <t>To minimize the risk of loops created by bogus applications and user-		   agents operators MAY use the mechanism shown in Section 3.1. However,		   this mechanism could be forged and bypassed by malicious users		   possibly creating a Denial of Service attack against the operator. To		   avoid completely the risk of DoS operators should use other methods		   such as rate-limit and authentication that are outside the scope of		   this document.</t>

		   <t>One of the challenges by using redirection is loop avoidance. Even		   though recommendation from REFERENCE** indicates that user-agents		   should have a mechanism to break loops, due to sometimes not carefully		   coded user-agents and other applications or due to malicious users' activities		   loops that could end up in a Denial of Service for the RESTful WHOIS operator. </t>		   <t>A simple scenario that creates a loop is shown in <xref target='simple_loop' />. A user		   request (1) an object from Operator 1; Operator 1 do not have the		   object but it has a pointer that Operator 2 has it, so it redirects		   (2) the user to Operator 2; user request Object X to Operator 2 (3);		   Operator 2 does not have the object either object but it has a		   pointer that Operator 1 has it, so it redirects (4) the user to		   Operator 1; it creates a loop (5).</t>		      <figure align="center" anchor="simple_loop">

	   <t>The loop described could be avoided by simple forbidding redirecting	   a response when the query has been originated by a redirect. However	   this solution only allows one redirection.

        <postamble>A more complex loop.</postamble>
      </figure>	   <t>In the scenario depicted in <xref target='complex_loop' /> the user request object X from	   Operator A which redirects him/her to Operator B which in turn	   redirects the user to Operator C. Operator C then redirects the user	   back to Operator A again creating a loop. </t>		   <t>To avoid loops created by not well-programmed user-agents or	   applications when redirecting operators MAY append or modify a	   special URI indicating that a redirection and how many times it has	   been done. The format of the URI is described as follows.</t>
				
			   <t>When a RESTful WHOIS operator redirects a user to retrieve an object			   from another operator, the operator making the redirection operator			   MAY append or modify a special URI.</t>						   <t>When using an URI to indicate redirection, the URI MUST have the			   following structure:</t>						   <t>/redirect/[step]</t>						   <t>Where [step] is a consecutive counter that MUST be increased by every			   operator when the URI is encountered in a query object.</t>						   <t>When an operator is redirecting a query for the first time it MAY			   append the redirection URI to the original URL. If the redirection			   URI is used, it MUST use the format previously described and it MUST			   set "step" equal to 1. For example, the URL			   "http://whois.lacnic.net/restfulwhois/ip/200.7.84.0/24" would be			   replaced by</t>

			   <t>"http://whois.example.com/restfulwhois/ip/200.7.84.0/24/redirect/1"</t>						   <t>If an operator receives a request with the redirect URI it first			   SHOULD check if "step" is shorter that the defined threshold. If it			   does the operator SHOULD strip it and process the query. If the query			   requires further redirection the operator MAY use the redirection URI			   and it MUST increase "step" in one. </t>						   <t>Operators that support the redirect URI MUST never create a new redirect
         that contain a step value greater that their locally set threshold. However
         if the operator has an authoritative response to the agent it MUST respond  
         regardless to the threshold value.</t>

		<t>
      Firstly, redirect server settings cannot be modified by someone other than the user validated by the redirection server.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      Secondly, insure the redirection URL data must not be able to modify URL in data 
      transmission process. Such as http://www.labs.lacnic.net/restwhois/rwhois_redir/ip/23.1.1.1 cannot 
      be modified to http://www.labs.somenic.net/restwhois/rwhois_redir/ip/23.1.1.1.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      While security practices are outside the scope of this document, the authors believe it 
      is important to identify such problematic use cases to any DNR or RIR that may implement the redirection WHOIS service.
