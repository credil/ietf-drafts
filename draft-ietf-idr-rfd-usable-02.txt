                    Making Route Flap Damping Usable
                      draft-ietf-idr-rfd-usable-02

Abstract

   Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in
   routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for
   being well-connected because topological richness amplifies the
   number of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD
   off.  Based on experimental measurement, this document recommends
   adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits, to reduce the
   high risks with RFD, with the result being damping a non-trivial
   amount of long term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes'
   normal convergence process.

1.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271] and Route
   Flap Damping, [RFC2439].  This work is based on the measurements in
   the paper [pelsser2011].  A survey of Japanese operators' use of RFD
   and their desires is reported in
   [I-D.shishio-grow-isp-rfd-implement-survey].

2.  Introduction

   Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed (see [ripe178] and
   [RFC2439]) and subsequently implemented to reduce BGP churn in
   routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for
   being well-connected because topological richness amplifies the
   number of update messages exchanged, see [mao2002].  Subsequently,

   many operators turned RFD off, see [ripe378].  Based on the
   measurements of [pelsser2011], [ripe580] now recommends that RFD is
   usable with some changes to the parameters.  Based on the same
   measurements, this document recommends adjusting a few RFD
   algorithmic constants and limits, with the result being damping of a
   non-trivial amount of long term churn without penalizing well-behaved
   prefixes' normal convergence process.

   Very few prefixes are responsible for a large amount of the BGP
   messages received by a router, see [huston2006] and [pelsser2011].
   For example, the measurements in [pelsser2011] showed that only 3% of
   the prefixes were responsible for 36% percent of the BGP messages at
   a router with real feeds from a Tier-1 and an Internet Exchange Point
   during a one week experiment.  Only these very frequently flapping
   prefixes should be damped.  The values recommended in Section 6
   achieve this.  Thus, RFD can be enabled, and some churn reduced.

   The goal is to, with absolutely minimal change, ameliorate the danger
   of current RFD implementations and use.  It is not a panacea, nor is
   it a deep and thorough approach to flap reduction.

3.  RFD Parameters

   The following RFD parameters are common to all implementations.  Some
   may be tuned by the operator, some not.

         +-------------------------+----------+-------+---------+
         | Parameter               | Tunable? | Cisco | Juniper |
         +-------------------------+----------+-------+---------+
         | Withdrawal              | No       |  1000 |    1000 |
         | Re-Advertisement        | No       |     0 |    1000 |
         | Attribute Change        | No       |   500 |     500 |
         | Suppress Threshold      | Yes      |  2000 |    3000 |
         | Half-Life (min)         | Yes      |    15 |      15 |
         | Reuse Threshold         | Yes      |   750 |     750 |
         | Max Suppress Time (min) | Yes      |    60 |      60 |

4.  Suppress Threshold Versus Churn

   By turning RFD back on with the values recommended in Section 6 churn
   is reduced.  Moreover, with these values, prefixes going through
   normal convergence are generally not damped.

   [pelsser2011] estimates that, with a suppress threshold of 6,000, the
   BGP update rate is reduced by 19% compared to a situation without RFD
   enabled.  With this 6,000 suppress threshold, 90% fewer prefixes are
   damped compared to use of a 2,000 threshold.  I.e.  far fewer well-
   behaved prefixes are damped.

   Setting the suppress threshold to 12,000 leads to very few damped
   prefixes (1.7% of the prefixes damped with a threshold of 2,000, in
   the experiments in [pelsser2011] yielding an average hourly update
   reduction of 11% compared to not using RFD.

5.  Maximum Penalty

   It is important to understand that the parameters shown in Table 1,
   and the implementation's sampling rate, impose an upper bound on the
   penalty value, which we can call the 'computed maximum penalty'.

   In addition, BGP implementations have an internal constant which we
   will call the 'maximum penalty' which the current computed penalty
   may not exceed.

6.  Recommendations

   The following changes are recommended:

   Router Maximum Penalty:  The internal constant for the maximum
      penalty value MUST be raised to at least 50,000.

   Default Configurable Parameters:  In order not to break existing
      operational configurations, BGP implementations SHOULD NOT change
      the default values in Table 1.

   Minimum Suppress Threshold:  Operators wishing damping which is much
      less destructive than current, but still somewhat aggressive
      SHOULD configure the Suppress Threshold to no less than 6,000.

   Conservative Suppress Threshold:  Conservative operators SHOULD
      configure the Suppress Threshold to no less than 12,000.

   Calculate But Do Not Damp:  Implementations MAY have a test mode
      where the operator could see the results of a particular
      configuration without actually damping any prefixes.  This will
      allow for fine tuning of parameters without losing reachability.

7.  Security Considerations

   It is well known that an attacker can generate false flapping to
   cause a victim's prefix(es) to be damped.

   As the recommendations merely change parameters to more conservative
   values, there should be no increase in risk.

   In fact, the parameter change to more conservative values should
   slightly mitigate the false flap attack.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
