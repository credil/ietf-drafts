                Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP
                     draft-ietf-httpauth-mutual-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a mutual authentication method for the Hyper-
   text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  This method provides a true mutual
   authentication between an HTTP client and an HTTP server using
   password-based authentication.  Unlike the Basic and Digest
   authentication methods, the Mutual authentication method specified in
   this document assures the user that the server truly knows the user's
   encrypted password.

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a mutual authentication method for Hyper-Text
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The method, called "Mutual Authentication
   Protocol" in this document, provides a true mutual authentication
   between an HTTP client and an HTTP server, using just a simple
   password as a credential.

   The authentication method proposed in this document has the following
   main characteristics:

   o  It provides "true" mutual authentication: in addition to assuring
      the server that the user knows the password, it also assures the
      user that the server truly knows the user's encrypted password at
      the same time.  This makes it impossible for fake website owners
      to persuade users that they have authenticated with the original
      websites.

   o  It uses only passwords as the user's credential: unlike public-
      key-based security algorithms, the method does not rely on secret
      keys or other cryptographic data that have to be stored inside the
      users' computers.  The proposed method can be used as a drop-in
      replacement to the current authentication methods like Basic or
      Digest, while ensuring a much stronger level of security.

   o  It is secure: when the server fails to authenticate with a user,
      the protocol will not reveal any tiny bit of information about the
      user's password.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document distinguishes the terms "client" and "user" in the
   following way: A "client" is an entity understanding and talking HTTP
   and the specified authentication protocol, usually computer software;
   a "user" is a (usually natural) person who wants to access data
   resources using "a client".

   The term "natural numbers" refers to the non-negative integers
   (including zero) throughout this document.

   This document treats target (codomain) of hash functions to be octet
   strings.  The notation INT(H(s)) gives a numerical (natural-number)
   output of hash function H applied to string s.

1.2.  Document Structure and Related Documents

   The entire document is organized as follows:

   o  Section 2 presents an overview of the protocol design.

   o  Sections 3 to 10 define a general framework of the Mutual
      authentication protocol.  This framework is independent of
      specific cryptographic primitives.

   o  Section 11 describes properties needed for cryptographic
      algorithms used with this protocol framework, and defines a few
      functions which will be shared among such cryptographic
      algorithms.

   o  The sections after that contain general normative and informative
      information about the protocol.

   o  The appendices contain some information that may help developers
      to implement the protocol.

   In addition, there are two companion documents which are referred
   from/related to this specification:

   o  [I-D.oiwa-httpauth-mutual-algo]: defines a cryptographic
      primitives which can be used with this protocol framework. [draft
      note: it is separated from this document so that it may be
      replaced with another crypto in future.]

   o  [I-D.ietf-httpauth-extension]: defines a small but useful
      extensions to the current HTTP authentication framework so that it
      can support application-level semantics of existing Web systems.


2.  Protocol Overview

   The protocol, as a whole, is designed as a natural extension to the
   HTTP protocol [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging] using a framework
   defined in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth].  Internally, the server and
   the client will first perform a cryptographic key exchange, using the
   secret password as a "tweak" to the exchange.  The key-exchange will
   only succeed when the secrets used by the both peers are correctly
   related (i.e. generated from the same password).  Then, both peers
   will verify the authentication results by confirming the sharing of
   the exchanged key.  This section describes a brief image of the
   protocol and the exchanged messages.

2.1.  Messages Overview

   The authentication protocol uses seven kinds of messages to perform
   mutual authentication.  These messages have specific names within
   this specification.

   o  Authentication request messages: used by the servers to request
      clients to start mutual authentication.

      *  401-INIT message: a general message to start the authentication
         protocol.  It is also used as a message indicating an
         authentication failure.

      *  401-STALE message: a message indicating that it has to start a
         new authentication trial.

   o  Authenticated key exchange messages: used by both peers to perform
      authentication and the sharing of a cryptographic secret.

      *  req-KEX-C1 message: a message sent from the client.

      *  401-KEX-S1 message: a message sent from the server as a
         response to a req-KEX-C1 message.

   o  Authentication verification messages: used by both peers to verify
      the authentication results.

      *  req-VFY-C message: a message used by the client, requesting
         that the server authenticates and authorizes the client.

      *  200-VFY-S message: a successful response used by the server,
         and also asserting that the server is authentic to the client
         simultaneously.

   In addition to the above, either a request or a response without any
   HTTP headers related to this specification will be hereafter called a
   "normal request" or a "normal response", respectively.

2.2.  Typical Flows of the Protocol

   In typical cases, the client access to a resource protected by the
   Mutual authentication will follow the following protocol sequence.

     Figure 1: Typical communication flow for first access to resource

   o  As usual in general HTTP protocol designs, a client will at first
      request a resource without any authentication attempt (1).  If the
      requested resource is protected by the Mutual authentication, the
      server will respond with a message requesting authentication
      (401-INIT) (2).

   o  The client processes the body of the message, and waits for the
      user to input the user name and a password.  If the user name and
      the password are available, the client will send a message with
      the authenticated key exchange (req-KEX-C1) to start the
      authentication (3).

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   o  If the server has received a req-KEX-C1 message, the server looks
      up the user's authentication information within its user database.
      Then the server creates a new session identifier (sid) that will
      be used to identify sets of the messages that follow it, and
      responds back with a message containing a server-side
      authenticated key exchange value (401-KEX-S1) (4).

   o  At this point (5), both peers calculate a shared "session secret"
      using the exchanged values in the key exchange messages.  Only
      when both the server and the client have used secret credentials
      generated from the same password,the session secret values will
      match.  This session secret will be used for access authentication
      of every individual request after this point.

   o  The client will send a request with a client-side authentication
      verification value (req-VFY-C) (6), generated from the client-
      owned session secret.  The server will check the validity of the
      verification value using its own session secret.

   o  If the authentication verification value from the client was
      correct, it means that the client definitely owns the credential
      based on the expected password (i.e. the client authentication
      succeeded.)  The server will respond with a successful message
      (200-VFY-S) (7).  Contrary to the usual one-way authentication
      (e.g.  HTTP Basic authentication or POP APOP authentication
      [RFC1939]), this message also contains a server-side
      authentication verification value.

      When the client's verification value is incorrect (e.g. because
      the user-supplied password was incorrect), the server will respond
      with the 401-INIT message (the same one as used in (2)) instead.

   o  The client MUST first check the validity of the server-side
      authentication verification value contained in the message (7).
      If the value was equal to the expected one, the server
      authentication succeeded.

      If it is not the value expected, or if the message does not
      contain the authentication verification value, it means that the
      mutual authentication has been broken for some unexpected reason.
      The client MUST NOT process any body or header values contained in
      this case.  (Note: This case should not happen between a
      correctly-implemented server and a client without any
      interventions.  Possible cause of such cases might be either a
      man-in-the-middle attack or a mis-implementation.)

2.3.  Alternative Flows

   As shown above, the typical flow for a first authenticated request
   requires three request-response pairs.  To reduce the protocol
   overhead, the protocol enables several short-cut flows which require
   fewer messages.

   o  (case A) If the client knows that the resource is likely to
      require the authentication, the client MAY omit the first
      unauthenticated request (1) and immediately send a key exchange
      (req-KEX-C1 message).  This will reduce one round-trip of
      messages.

   o  (case B) If both the client and the server previously shared a
      session secret associated with a valid session identifier (sid),
      the client MAY directly send a req-VFY-C message using the
      existing session identifier and corresponding session secret.
      This will further reduce one round-trip of messages.

      In such cases, the server MAY have thrown out the corresponding
      sessions from the session table.  In this case, the server will
      respond with a 401-STALE message, indicating a new key exchange is
      required.  The client SHOULD retry constructing a req-KEX-C1
      message in this case.

   Figure 2 depicts the shortcut flows described above.  Under the
   appropriate settings and implementations, most of the requests to
   resources are expected to meet both the criteria, and thus only one
   round-trip of request/responses will be required in most cases.

3.  Message Syntax

   Throughout this specification, The syntax is denoted in the extended
   augmented BNF syntax defined in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging] and
   [RFC5234].  The following elements are quoted from [RFC5234],
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging] and [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth]:
   DIGIT, ALPHA, SP, auth-scheme, quoted-string, auth-param, header-
   field, token, challenge, and credential.

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   The Mutual authentication protocol uses three headers:
   WWW-Authenticate (in responses with status code 401), Authorization
   (in requests), and Authentication-Info (in responses other than 401
   status).  These headers follow a common framework described in
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth].  The detailed meanings for these headers
   are contained in Section 4.

   The framework in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth] defines the syntax for
   the headers WWW-Authenticate and Authorization as the syntax elements
   "challenge" and "credentials", respectively.  The "auth-scheme"
   contained in those headers MUST be "Mutual" throughout this protocol
   specification.  The syntax for "challenge" and "credentials" to be
   used with the "Mutual" auth-scheme SHALL be name-value pairs (#auth-
   param), not the "b64token" defined in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth].

   The Authentication-Info: header used in this protocol SHALL contain
   the value in same syntax as those the "WWW-Authenticate" header, i.e.
   the "challenge" syntax element.

   In HTTP, the WWW-Authenticate header may contain more than one
   challenges.  Client implementations SHOULD be aware of and be capable
   of handle those cases correctly.

3.1.  Values

   The parameter values contained in challenge/credentials MUST be
   parsed strictly conforming to the HTTP semantics (especially un-
   quoting of the string parameter values).  In this protocol, those
   values are further categorized into the following value types: tokens
   (bare-token and extensive-token), string, integer, hex-fixed-number,
   and base64-fixed-number.

   For clarity, implementations are RECOMMENDED to use the canonical
   representations specified in the following subsections for sending
   values.  Recipients SHOULD accept both quoted and unquoted
   representations interchangeably as specified in HTTP.

3.1.1.  Tokens

   For sustaining both security and extensibility at the same time, this
   protocol defines a stricter sub-syntax for the "token" to be used.
   The extensive-token values SHOULD follow the following syntax (after
   HTTP value parsing):

    bare-token       = 1*(DIGIT / ALPHA / "-" / "_")
    extension-token  = "-" bare-token 1*("." bare-token)
    extensive-token  = bare-token / extension-token

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


                   Figure 3: BNF syntax for token values

   The tokens (bare-token and extension-token) are case insensitive;
   Senders SHOULD send these in lower-case, and receivers MUST accept
   both upper- and lower-cases.  When tokens are used as (partial)
   inputs to any hash or other mathematical functions, it MUST always be
   used in lower-case.

   Extensive-tokens are used in this protocol where the set of
   acceptable tokens may include non-standard extensions.  Any non-
   standard extensions of this protocol SHOULD use the extension-tokens
   with format "-<bare-token>.<domain-name>", where <domain-name> is a
   validly registered (sub-)domain name on the Internet owned by the
   party who defines the extensions.

   Bare-tokens and extensive-tokens are also used for parameter names
   (of course in the unquoted form).  Requirements for using the
   extension-token for the parameter names are the same as the above.

   The canonical format for bare-tokens and tokens are unquoted tokens.

3.1.2.  Strings

   All character strings MUST be encoded to octet strings using the
   UTF-8 encoding [RFC3629] for the ISO 10646-1 character set
   [ISO.10646-1.1993].  Such strings MUST NOT contain any leading BOM
   characters (ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE, U+FEFF or EF BB BF).  Both
   peers are RECOMMENDED to reject any invalid UTF-8 sequences that
   might cause decoding ambiguities (e.g., containing <"> in the second
   or later bytes of the UTF-8 encoded characters).

   If strings are representing a domain name or URI that contains non-
   ASCII characters, the host parts SHOULD be encoded as it is used in
   the HTTP protocol layer (e.g. in a Host: header); under current
   standards it will be the one defined in [RFC5890].  It SHOULD use
   lower-case ASCII characters.

   The canonical format for strings are quoted-string (as it may contain
   equal signs, plus signs and slashes).

3.1.3.  Numbers

   The following syntax definitions gives a syntax for number-type
   values:







Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


    integer          = "0" / (%x31-39 *DIGIT)      ; no leading zeros
    hex-fixed-number = 1*(2(DIGIT / %x41-46 / %x61-66))
    base64-fixed-number = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/" ) 0*2"="

                   Figure 4: BNF syntax for number types

   The syntax definition of the integers only allows representations
   that do not contain extra leading zeros.

   The numbers represented as a hex-fixed-number MUST include an even
   number of characters (i.e. multiples of eight bits).  Those values
   are case-insensitive, and SHOULD be sent in lower-case.  When these
   values are generated from any cryptographic values, they SHOULD have
   their "natural length": if these are generated from a hash function,
   these lengths SHOULD correspond to the hash size; if these are
   representing elements of a mathematical set (or group), its lengths
   SHOULD be the shortest for representing all the elements in the set.
   For example, any results of SHA-256 hash function will be represented
   by 64 characters, and any elements in 2048-bit prime field (modulo a
   2048-bit integer) will be represented by 512 characters, regardless
   of how much 0's will be appear in front of such representations.
   Session-identifiers and other non-cryptographically generated values
   are represented in any (even) length determined by the side who
   generates it first, and the same length SHALL be used throughout the
   all communications by both peers.

   The numbers represented as base64-fixed-number SHALL be generated as
   follows: first, the number is converted to a big-endian radix-256
   binary representation as an octet string.  The length of the
   representation is determined in the same way as mentioned above.
   Then, the string is encoded using the Base 64 encoding [RFC4648]
   without any spaces and newlines.  Implementations decoding base64-
   fixed-number SHOULD reject any input data with invalid characters,
   excess/insufficient paddings, or non-canonical pad bits (See Sections
   3.1 to 3.5 of [RFC4648]).

   The canonical format for integer and hex-fixed-number are unquoted
   tokens, and that for base64-fixed-number is quoted-string.


4.  Messages

   In this section we define the seven kinds of messages used in the
   authentication protocol along with the formats and requirements of
   the headers for each message.

   To determine which message are expected to be sent, see Sections 9
   and 10.

   In the descriptions below, the type of allowable values for each
   header parameter is shown in parenthesis after each parameter name.
   The "algorithm-determined" type means that the acceptable value for
   the parameter is one of the types defined in Section 3, and is
   determined by the value of the "algorithm" parameter.  The parameters
   marked "mandatory" SHALL be contained in the message.  The parameters
   marked "non-mandatory" MAY either be contained or omitted in the
   message.  Each parameter SHALL appear in each headers exactly once at
   most.

   All credentials and challenges MAY contain any parameters not
   explicitly specified in the following sections.  Recipients who do
   not understand such parameters MUST silently ignore those.  However,
   all credentials and challenges MUST meet the following criteria:

   o  For responses, the parameters "reason", any "ks*" (where * stands
      for any decimal integers), and "vks" are mutually exclusive: any
      challenge MUST NOT contain two or more parameters among them.
      They MUST NOT contain any "kc*" and "vkc" parameters.

   o  For requests, the parameters "kc*" (where * stands for any decimal
      integers), and "vkc" are mutually exclusive and any challenge
      MUST NOT contain two or more parameters among them.  They MUST NOT
      contain any "ks*" and "vks" parameters.

   Every message in this section contains a "version" field, to detect
   future incompatible revisions of the protocol.  Implementations of
   the protocol described in this specification MUST always send a token
   "-wg-draft01", and recipients MUST reject messages which contain any
   other value as a version, unless another specification defines a
   behavior for that version.  [[Editorial Note: This token is updated
   on every draft revisions which will affect the wire protocol.  It
   will (shall) be updated to "1" in the final published RFC.]]

4.1.  401-INIT and 401-STALE

   Every 401-INIT or 401-STALE message SHALL be a valid HTTP 401-status
   (Authentication Required) message containing one (and only one:
   hereafter not explicitly noticed) "WWW-Authenticate" header
   containing a "reason" parameter in the challenge.  The challenge
   SHALL contain all of the parameters marked "mandatory" below, and MAY
   contain those marked "non-mandatory".

   version:       (mandatory extensive-token) should be the token "-wg-
                  draft01".

   algorithm:     (mandatory extensive-token) specifies the
                  authentication algorithm to be used.  The value MUST
                  be one of the tokens specified in
                  [I-D.oiwa-httpauth-mutual-algo] or other supplemental
                  specification documentation.

   validation:    (mandatory extensive-token) specifies the method of
                  host validation.  The value MUST be one of the tokens
                  described in Section 7, or the tokens specified in
                  other supplemental specification documentation.

   auth-domain:   (non-mandatory string) specifies the authentication
                  domain, the set of hosts for which the authentication
                  credentials are valid.  It MUST be one of the strings
                  described in Section 5.  If the value is omitted, it
                  is assumed to be the "single-server" type domain in
                  Section 5.

   realm:         (mandatory string) is a UTF-8 encoded string
                  representing the name of the authentication realm
                  inside the authentication domain.  As specified in
                  [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth], this value MUST always be
                  sent in the quoted-string form.

   pwd-hash:      (non-mandatory extensive-token) specifies the hash
                  algorithm (hereafter referred to by ph) used for
                  additionally hashing the password.  The valid tokens
                  are

                  *  none: ph(p) = p

                  *  md5: ph(p) = MD5(p)

                  *  digest-md5: ph(p) = MD5(username | ":" | realm |
                     ":" | p), the same value as MD5(A1) for "MD5"
                     algorithm in [RFC2617].

                  *  sha1: ph(p) = SHA1(p)

                  If omitted, the value "none" is assumed.  The use of
                  "none" is desirable.

   reason:        (mandatory extensive-token) SHALL be an extensive-
                  token which describes the possible reason of the
                  failed authentication/authorization.  Both servers and
                  clients SHALL understand and support the following
                  three tokens:

                  *  initial: authentication was not tried because there
                     was no Authorization header in the corresponding
                     request.

                  *  stale-session: the provided sid; in the request was
                     either unknown to or expired in the server.

                  *  auth-failed: authentication trial was failed by
                     some reasons, possibly with a bad authentication
                     credentials.

                  Implementations MAY support the following tokens or
                  any extensive-tokens defined outside this
                  specification.  If clients has received any unknown
                  tokens, these SHOULD treat these as if it were "auth-
                  failed" or "initial".

                  *  reauth-needed: server-side application requires a
                     new authentication trial, regardless of the current
                     status.

                  *  invalid-parameters: authentication was not even
                     tried in the server-side because some parameters
                     are not acceptable.

                  *  internal-error: authentication was not even tried
                     in the server-side because there is some troubles
                     on the server-side.

                  *  user-unknown: a special case of auth-failed,
                     suggesting that the provided user-name is invalid.
                     The use of this parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED for
                     security implications, except for special-purpose
                     applications which makes this value sense.

                  *  invalid-credential: ditto, suggesting that the
                     provided user-name was valid but authentication was
                     failed.  The use of this parameter is
                     NOT RECOMMENDED as the same as the above.

                  *  authz-failed: authentication was successful, but
                     access to the specified resource is not authorized
                     to the specific authenticated user.  (It is
                     different from 403 responses which suggest that the
                     reason of inaccessibility is other that
                     authentication.)

   (among those defined in Section 3) and the values for K_c1, K_s1,
   VK_c and VK_s.

   Among these messages, those with the reason parameter of value
   "stale-session" will be called "401-STALE" messages hereafter,
   because these have a special meaning in the protocol flow.  Messages
   with any other reason parameters will be called "401-INIT" messages.

4.2.  req-KEX-C1

   Every req-KEX-C1 message SHALL be a valid HTTP request message
   containing an "Authorization" header with a credential containing a
   "kc1" parameter.

   The credential SHALL contain the parameters with the following names:

   version:       (mandatory, extensive-token) should be the token "-wg-
                  draft01".

   algorithm, validation, auth-domain, realm:  MUST be the same value as
                  it is when received from the server.

   user:          (mandatory, string) is the UTF-8 encoded name of the
                  user.  If this name comes from a user input, client
                  software SHOULD prepare the string using HTTPAUTHprep
                  [I-D.oiwa-precis-httpauthprep] before encoding it to
                  UTF-8.  [[Editorial: merger with new SASLprep is being
                  considered and discussed in precis WG.  Replace the
                  reference once it is done.]]

   kc1:           (mandatory, algorithm-determined) is the client-side
                  key exchange value K_c1, which is specified by the
                  algorithm that is used.

4.3.  401-KEX-S1

   Every 401-KEX-S1 message SHALL be a valid HTTP 401-status
   (Authentication Required) response message containing a
   "WWW-Authenticate" header with a challenge containing a "ks1"
   parameter.

   The challenge SHALL contain the parameters with the following names:

   algorithm, validation, auth-domain, realm:  MUST be the same value as
                  it is when received from the client.

   sid:           (mandatory, hex-fixed-number) MUST be a session
                  identifier, which is a random integer.  The sid SHOULD
                  have uniqueness of at least 80 bits or the square of
                  the maximal estimated transactions concurrently
                  available in the session table, whichever is larger.
                  See Section 6 for more details.

   ks1:           (mandatory, algorithm-determined) is the server-side
                  key exchange value K_s1, which is specified by the
                  algorithm.

   nc-max:        (mandatory, integer) is the maximal value of nonce
                  counts that the server accepts.

   nc-window:     (mandatory, integer) the number of available nonce
                  slots that the server will accept.  The value of the
                  nc-window parameter is RECOMMENDED to be 32 or more.

   time:          (mandatory, integer) represents the suggested time (in
                  seconds) that the client can reuse the session
                  represented by the sid.  It is RECOMMENDED to be at
                  least 60.  The value of this parameter is not directly
                  linked to the duration that the server keeps track of
                  the session represented by the sid.

   path:          (non-mandatory, string) specifies which path in the
                  URI space the same authentication is expected to be
                  applied.  The value is a space-separated list of URIs,
                  in the same format as it was specified in domain
                  parameter [RFC2617] for the Digest authentications.
                  The all path elements contained in the parameter MUST
                  be inside the specified auth-domain; if not, clients
                  SHOULD ignore such elements.  For better performance,
                  recognition of this parameter by clients are
                  significantly important.

4.4.  req-VFY-C

   Every req-VFY-C message SHALL be a valid HTTP request message
   containing an "Authorization" header with a credential containing a
   "vkc" parameter.

   The parameters contained in the header are as follows:

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   version:       (mandatory, extensive-token) should be the token "-wg-
                  draft01".

   algorithm, validation, auth-domain, realm:  MUST be the same value as
                  it is when received from the server for the session.

   sid:           (mandatory, hex-fixed-number) MUST be one of the sid
                  values that was received from the server for the same
                  authentication realm.

   nc:            (mandatory, integer) is a nonce value that is unique
                  among the requests sharing the same sid.  The values
                  of the nonces SHOULD satisfy the properties outlined
                  in Section 6.

   vkc:           (mandatory, algorithm-determined) is the client-side
                  authentication verification value VK_c, which is
                  specified by the algorithm.

4.5.  200-VFY-S

   Every 200-VFY-S message SHALL be a valid HTTP message that is not of
   the 401 (Authentication Required) status, containing an
   "Authentication-Info" header with a "vks" parameter.

   The parameters contained in the header are as follows:

   version:       (mandatory, extensive-token) should be the token "-wg-
                  draft01".

   sid:           (mandatory, hex-fixed-number) MUST be the value
                  received from the client.

   vks:           (mandatory, algorithm-determined) is the server-side
                  authentication verification value VK_s, which is
                  specified by the algorithm.

   The header MUST be sent before the content body: it MUST NOT be sent
   in the trailer of a chunked-encoded response.  If a "100 Continue"
   response is sent from the server, the Authentication-Info header
   SHOULD be included in that response, instead of the final response.


5.  Authentication Realms

   In this protocol, an "authentication realm" is defined as a set of
   resources (URIs) for which the same set of user names and passwords
   is valid for.  If the server requests authentication for an



Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   authentication realm that the client is already authenticated for,
   the client will automatically perform the authentication using the
   already-known secrets.  However, for the different authentication
   realms, the clients MUST NOT automatically reuse the user names and
   passwords for another realm.

   Just like in Basic and Digest access authentication protocols, Mutual
   authentication protocol supports multiple, separate protection spaces
   to be set up inside each host.  Furthermore, the protocol supports
   that a single authentication realm spans over several hosts within
   the same Internet domain.

   Each authentication realm is defined and distinguished by the triple
   of an "authentication algorithm", an "authentication domain", and a
   "realm" parameter.  However, server operators are NOT RECOMMENDED to
   use the same pair of an authentication domain and a realm for
   different authentication algorithms.

   The realm parameter is a string as defined in Section 4.
   Authentication domains are described in the remainder of this
   section.

   An authentication domain specifies the range of hosts that the
   authentication realm spans over.  In this protocol, it MUST be one of
   the following strings.

   o  Single-server type: The string in format
      "<scheme>://<host>:<port>", where <scheme>, <host>, and <port> are
      the corresponding URI parts of the request URI.  Even if the
      request-URI does not have a port part, the string will include one
      (i.e. 80 for http and 443 for https).  The port part MUST NOT
      contain leading zeros.  Use this when authentication is only valid
      for specific protocol (such as https).

   o  Single-host type: The "host" part of the requested URI.  This is
      the default value.  Authentication realms within this kind of
      authentication domain will span over several protocols (i.e. http
      and https) and ports, but not over different hosts.

   o  Wildcard-domain type: The string in format "*.<domain-postfix>",
      where <domain-postfix> is either the host part of the requested
      URI or any domain in which the requested host is included (this
      means that the specification "*.example.com" is valid for all of
      hosts "www.example.com", "web.example.com",
      "www.sales.example.com" and "example.com").  The domain-postfix
      sent from the servers MUST be equal to or included in a valid
      Internet domain assigned to a specific organization: if clients
      know, by some means such as a blacklist for HTTP cookies



Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


      [RFC6265], that the specified domain is not to be assigned to any
      specific organization (e.g. "*.com" or "*.jp"), the clients are
      RECOMMENDED to reject the authentication request.

   In the above specifications, every "scheme", "host", and "domain"
   MUST be in lower-case, and any internationalized domain names beyond
   the ASCII character set SHALL be represented in the way they are sent
   in the underlying HTTP protocol, represented in lower-case
   characters; i.e. these SHALL be in the form of the LDH labels in IDNA
   [RFC5890].  All "port"s MUST be in the shortest, unsigned, decimal
   number notation.  Not obeying these requirements will cause failure
   of valid authentication attempts.

5.1.  Resolving Ambiguities

   In the above definitions of authentication domains, several domains
   will overlap each other.  If a client has already been authenticated
   to several realms applicable to the same server, the client may have
   a multiple list of the "path" parameters received with the
   "401-KEX-S1" message (see Section 4).  If these path lists have any
   overlap, a single URI may belong to multiple possible candidate of
   realms to be authenticated to.  In such cases, clients faces an
   ambiguity on deciding which credentials to be sent for a new request
   (in steps 3 and 4 of the decision procedure presented in Section 9).

   In such cases, clients MAY send requests which belongs to any of
   these candidate realms freely, or it MAY simply send an
   unauthenticated request and see for which realm the server request an
   authentication.  Server operators are RECOMMENDED to provide
   properly-configured "path" parameters (more precisely, disjoint path
   sets for each realms) for clients so that such ambiguities will not
   occur.

   The following procedure are one of the possible tactics for resolving
   ambiguity in such cases.

   o  If the client has previously sent a request to the same URI, and
      if it remembers the authentication realm requested by 401-INIT
      messages at that time, use that realm.

   o  In other cases, use one of authentication realms representing the
      most-specific authentication domains.  From the list of possible
      domain specifications shown above, each one earlier has priority
      over ones described after that.

      If there are several choices with different domain-postfix
      specifications, the one that has the longest domain-postfix has
      priority over ones with a shorter domain-postfix.



Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   o  If there are realms with the same authentication domain, there is
      no defined priority: the client MAY choose any one of the possible
      choices.


6.  Session Management

   In the Mutual authentication protocol, a session represented by an
   sid is set up using first four messages (first request, 401-INIT,
   req-KEX-C1 and 401-KEX-S1), and a "session secret" (z) associated
   with the session is established.  After sharing a session secret,
   this session, along with the secret, can be used for one or more
   requests for resources protected by the same realm in the same
   server.  Note that session management is only an inside detail of the
   protocol and usually not visible to normal users.  If a session
   expires, the client and server SHOULD automatically re-establish
   another session without informing the users.

   Sessions and session identifiers are local to each server (defined by
   scheme, host and port), even if an authentication domain covers
   multiple servers; the clients MUST establish separate sessions for
   each port of a host to be accessed.  Furthermore, sessions and
   identifiers are also local to each authentication realm, even if
   these are provided from the same server.  The same session
   identifiers provided either from different servers or for different
   realms MUST be treated as independent ones.

   The server SHOULD accept at least one req-VFY-C request for each
   session, given that the request reaches the server in a time window
   specified by the timeout parameter in the 401-KEX-S1 message, and
   that there are no emergent reasons (such as flooding attacks) to
   forget the sessions.  After that, the server MAY discard any session
   at any time and MAY send 401-STALE messages for any req-VFY-C
   requests.

   The client MAY send two or more requests using a single session
   specified by the sid.  However, for all such requests, each value of
   the nonce (in the nc parameter) MUST satisfy the following
   conditions:

   o  It is a natural number.

   o  The same nonce was not sent within the same session.

   o  It is not larger than the nc-max value that was sent from the
      server in the session represented by the sid.





Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   o  It is larger than (largest-nc - nc-window), where largest-nc is
      the maximal value of nc which was previously sent in the session,
      and nc-window is the value of the nc-window parameter which was
      received from the server in the session.

   The last condition allows servers to reject any nonce values that are
   "significantly" smaller than the "current" value (defined by the
   value of nc-window) of the nonce used in the session involved.  In
   other words, servers MAY treat such nonces as "already received".
   This restriction enables servers to implement duplicated nonce
   detection in a constant amount of memory (for each session).

   Servers MUST check for duplication of the received nonces, and if any
   duplication is detected, the server MUST discard the session and
   respond with a 401-STALE message, as outlined in Section 10.  The
   server MAY also reject other invalid nonce values (such as ones above
   the nc-max limit) by sending a 401-STALE message.

   For example, assume the nc-window value of the current session is 32,
   nc-max is 100, and that the client has already used the following
   nonce values: {1-20, 22, 24, 30-38, 45-60, 63-72}.  Then the nonce
   values that can be used for next request is one of the following set:
   {41-44, 61-62, 73-100}.  The values {0, 21, 23, 25-29, 39-40} MAY be
   rejected by the server because they are not above the current "window
   limit" (40 = 72 - 32).

   Typically, clients can ensure the above property by using a
   monotonically-increasing integer counter that counts from zero upto
   the value of nc-max.

   The values of the nonces and any nonce-related values MUST always be
   treated as natural numbers within an infinite range.  Implementations
   which uses fixed-width integer representations, fixed-precision
   floating numbers or similar representations SHOULD NOT reject any
   larger values which overflow such representative limits, and MUST NOT
   silently truncate it using any modulus-like rounding operation (e.g.
   by mod 2^32).  Instead, the whole protocol is carefully designed so
   that recipients MAY replace any such overflowed values (e.g. 2^80)
   with some reasonably-large maximal representative integer (e.g. 2^31
   - 1 or others).


7.  Host Validation Methods

   The "validation method" specifies a method to "relate" (or "bind")
   the mutual authentication processed by this protocol with other
   authentications already performed in the underlying layers and to
   prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  It decides the value vh that is



Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   an input to the authentication protocols.

   When HTTPS or other possible secure transport is used, this
   corresponds to the idea of "channel binding" described in [RFC5929].
   Even when HTTP is used, similar, but somewhat limited, "binding" is
   performed to prevent a malicious server from trying to authenticate
   themselves to another server as a valid user by forwarding the
   received credentials.

   The valid tokens for the validation parameter and corresponding
   values of vh are as follows:

   host:          host-name validation: The value vh will be the ASCII
                  string in the following format:
                  "<scheme>://<host>:<port>", where <scheme>, <host>,
                  and <port> are the URI components corresponding to the
                  currently accessing resource.  The scheme and host are
                  in lower-case, and the port is in a shortest decimal
                  representation.  Even if the request-URI does not have
                  a port part, v will include the default port number.

   tls-server-end-point:  TLS endpoint (certificate) validation: The
                  value vh will be the octet string of the hash value of
                  the server's public key certificate used in the
                  underlying TLS [RFC5246] (or SSL) connection,
                  processed as specified in Section 4.1 of [RFC5929].

                  [[Pending editorial issue: a small security issue is
                  pending around here, awaiting analysis and WG
                  discussions for final adoption.]]

   tls-unique:    TLS shared-key validation: The value v will be the
                  channel binding material derived from the Finished
                  messages, as defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC5929].

   If the HTTP protocol is used on a non-encrypted channel (TCP and
   SCTP, for example), the validation type MUST be "host".  If HTTP/TLS
   [RFC2818] (HTTPS) protocol is used with the server certificates, the
   validation type MUST be "tls-server-end-point".  If HTTP/TLS protocol
   is used with an anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the validation
   type MUST be "tls-unique" (see the note below).

   Implementations supporting a Mutual authentication over the HTTPS
   protocol SHOULD support the "tls-server-end-point" validation.
   Support for "tls-unique" validation is OPTIONAL for both the servers
   and clients.

   If the validation type "tls-server-end-point" is used, the server



Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   certificate provided on TLS connection MUST be verified at least to
   make sure that the server actually owns the corresponding secret key.
   (Note: this verification is automatic in some RSA-based key exchanges
   but NOT automatic in Diffie-Hellman-based key exchanges with separate
   exchange for server verifications.)

   Clients MUST validate this parameter upon reception of the 401-INIT
   messages.

   Note: The protocol defines two variants for validation on the TLS
   connections.  The "tls-unique" method is more secure.  However, there
   are some situations where tls-server-end-point is more preferable.

   o  When TLS accelerating proxies are used, it is difficult for the
      authenticating server to acquire the TLS key information that is
      used between the client and the proxy.  This is not the case for
      client-side "tunneling" proxies using a CONNECT method extension
      of HTTP.

   o  When a black-box implementation of the TLS protocol is used on
      either peer.

7.1.  Applicability notes

   When the client is a Web browser with any scripting capabilities, the
   underlying TLS channel used with HTTP/TLS MUST provide server
   identity verification.  This means (1) the anonymous Diffie-Hellman
   key exchange cipher-suite MUST NOT be used, and (2) the verification
   of the server certificate provided from the server MUST be performed.

   For other systems, when the underlying TLS channel used with HTTP/TLS
   does not perform server identity verification, the client SHOULD
   ensure that all the responses are validated using the Mutual
   authentication protocol, regardless of the existence of the 401-INIT
   responses.

7.2.  Interoperability notes on tls-unique

   As described in the interoperability note in the above channel
   binding specification, the tls-unique verification value will be
   changed by possible TLS renegotiation, causing an interoperability
   problem.  TLS re-negotiations are used in several HTTPS server
   implementations for enforcing some security properties (such as
   cryptographic strength) for some specific responses.

   If an implementation supports "tls-unique" verification method, the
   following caution SHOULD be taken:




Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   o  Both peers must be aware that the values vh used for vkc (in
      req-VFY-C) and for vks (in 200-VFY-S) may be different.  These
      values MUST be retrieved from underlying TLS libraries each time
      it is used.

   o  After calculating value vh and vkc to send a req-VFY-C request,
      Clients SHOULD NOT initiate TLS renegotiation until the end of the
      corresponding response header is received.  Exceptionally, Clients
      can and SHOULD perform TLS re-negotiation as a response to
      server's request for TLS renegotiation, occurring before the top
      of response header.


8.  Authentication Extensions

   Interactive clients (e.g.  Web browsers) supporting this protocol are
   RECOMMENDED to support non-mandatory authentication and the
   Authentication-Control header defined in
   [I-D.ietf-httpauth-extension], except the "auth-style" parameter.
   This specification also proposes (however, not mandates) default
   "auth-style" to be "non-modal".  Web applications SHOULD however
   consider the security impacts of the behaviors of clients that do not
   support these headers.

   Authentication-initializing messages with the
   Optional-WWW-Authenticate header are used only where 401-INIT
   response is valid.  It will not replace other 401-type messages such
   as 401-STALE and 401-KEX-S1.


9.  Decision Procedure for Clients

   To securely implement the protocol, the user client must be careful
   about accepting the authenticated responses from the server.  This
   also holds true for the reception of "normal responses" (responses
   which do not contain Mutual-related headers) from HTTP servers.

   Clients SHOULD implement a decision procedure equivalent to the one
   shown below.  (Unless implementers understand what is required for
   the security, they should not alter this.)  In particular, clients
   SHOULD NOT accept "normal responses" unless explicitly allowed below.
   The labels on the steps are for informational purposes only.  Action
   entries within each step are checked in top-to-bottom order, and the
   first clause satisfied SHOULD be taken.

   Step 1 (step_new_request):
       If the client software needs to access a new Web resource, check
       whether the resource is expected to be inside some authentication
       realm for which the user has already been authenticated by the
       Mutual authentication scheme.  If yes, go to Step 2.  Otherwise,
       go to Step 5.

   Step 2:
       Check whether there is an available sid for the authentication
       realm you expect.  If there is one, go to Step 3.  Otherwise, go
       to Step 4.

   Step 3 (step_send_vfy_1):
       Send a req-VFY-C request.

          authentication realm than expected, go to Step 6.

       *  If you receive a 401-STALE message, go to Step 9.

       *  If you receive a 401-INIT message, go to Step 13.

       *  If you receive a 200-VFY-S message, go to Step 14.

       *  If you receive a normal response, go to Step 11.

   Step 4 (step_send_kex1_1):
       Send a req-KEX-C1 request.

       *  If you receive a 401-INIT message with a different
          authentication realm than expected, go to Step 6.

       *  If you receive a 401-KEX-S1 message, go to Step 10.

       *  If you receive a 401-INIT message with the same authentication
          realm, go to Step 13 (see Note 1).

       *  If you receive a normal response, go to Step 11.

   Step 5 (step_send_normal_1):
       Send a request without any Mutual authentication headers.

       *  If you receive a 401-INIT message, go to Step 6.

       *  If you receive a normal response, go to Step 11.

   Step 6 (step_rcvd_init):
       Check whether you know the user's password for the requested
       authentication realm.  If yes, go to Step 7.  Otherwise, go to
       Step 12.

   Step 7:

   Step 9 (step_send_kex1):
       Send a req-KEX-C1 request.

       *  If you receive a 401-KEX-S1 message, go to Step 10.

   Step 10 (step_rcvd_kex1):
       Send a req-VFY-C request.

       *  If you receive a 401-INIT message, go to Step 13.

       *  If you receive a 200-VFY-S message, go to Step 14.

   Step 11 (step_rcvd_normal):
       The requested resource is out of the authenticated area.  The
       client will be in the "UNAUTHENTICATED" status.  If the response
       contains a request for authentications other than Mutual, it MAY
       be handled normally.

   Step 12 (step_rcvd_init_unknown):
       The requested resource requires a Mutual authentication, and the
       user is not yet authenticated.  The client will be in the "AUTH-
       REQUESTED" status, and is RECOMMENDED to process the content sent
       from the server, and to ask user for a user name and a password.
       When those are supplied from the user, proceed to Step 9.

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   Step 13 (step_rcvd_init_failed):
       For some reason the authentication failed: possibly the password
       or the username is invalid for the authenticated resource.
       Forget the password for the authentication realm and go to Step
       12.

   Step 14 (step_rcvd_vfy):
       The received message is the 200-VFY-S message, which SHALL always
       contain a vks field.  Check the validity of the received VK_s
       value.  If it is equal to the expected value, it means that the
       mutual authentication has succeeded.  The client will be in the
       "AUTH-SUCCEEDED" status.

       If the value is unexpected, it is a fatal communication error.

       If a user explicitly requests to log out (via user interfaces),
       the client MUST forget the user's password, go to step 5 and
       reload the current resource without an authentication header.

   Note 1:  These transitions MAY be accepted by clients, but
       NOT RECOMMENDED for servers to initiate.

   Any kind of response (including a normal response) other than those
   shown in the above procedure SHOULD be interpreted as a fatal
   communication error, and in such cases the clients MUST NOT process
   any data (response body and other content-related headers) sent from
   the server.  However, to handle exceptional error cases, clients MAY
   accept a message without an Authentication-Info header, if it is a
   Server-Error (5xx) status.  In such cases, they SHOULD be careful
   about processing the body of the content (ignoring it is still
   RECOMMENDED), and the client will be in the "UNAUTHENTICATED" status
   then.

   If a request is a sub-request for a resource included in another
   resources (e.g., embedded images, style sheets, frames etc.), clients
   MAY treat an AUTH-REQUESTED status as the same as UNAUTHENTICATED
   status.  In other words, the client MAY ignore server's request to
   start authentication with new credentials via sub-requests.

   Figure 5 shows a diagram of the client-side state.

10.  Decision Procedure for Servers

   Each server SHOULD have a table of session states.  This table need
   not be persistent over a long term; it MAY be cleared upon server
   restart, reboot, or others.  Each entry in the table SHOULD contain
   at least the following information:

   o  The session identifier, the value of the sid parameter.

   o  The algorithm used.

   o  The authentication realm.

   o  The state of the protocol: one of "key exchanging",
      "authenticated", "rejected", or "inactive".

   o  The user name received from the client

   o  The boolean flag noting whether or not the session is fake.

   o  When the state is "key exchanging", the values of K_c1 and S_s1.

   o  When the state is "authenticated", the following information:

      *  The value of the session secret z

      *  The largest nc received from the client (largest-nc)

      *  For each possible nc values between (largest-nc - nc-
         window + 1) and max_nc, a flag whether or not a request with
         the corresponding nc has been received.

   The table MAY contain other information.

   Servers SHOULD respond to the client requests according to the
   following procedure: (See Note 1 below for 401-INIT message with *
   marks)

   o  When the server receives a normal request:

      *  If the requested resource is not protected by the Mutual
         Authentication, send a normal response.

      *  If the resource is protected by the Mutual Authentication, send
         a 401-INIT response.

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   o  When the server receives a req-KEX-C1 request:

      *  If the requested resource is not protected by the Mutual
         Authentication, send a normal response.

      *  If the authentication realm specified in the req-KEX-C1 request
         is not the expected one, send a 401-INIT response.

      *  If the server cannot validate the parameter kc1, send a
         401-INIT (*) response.

      *  If the received user name is either invalid, unknown or
         unacceptable, create a new session, mark it a "fake" session,
         compute a random value as K_s1, and send a fake 401-KEX-S1
         response.  (Note 2)

      *  Otherwise, create a new session, compute K_s1 and send a
         401-KEX-S1 response.

      The created session has the "key exchanging" state.

   o  When the server receives a req-VFY-C request:

      *  If the requested resource is not protected by the Mutual
         Authentication, send a normal response.

      *  If the authentication realm specified in the req-VFY-C request
         is not the expected one, send a 401-INIT response.

      If none of above holds true, the server will lookup the session
      corresponding to the received sid and the authentication realm.

      *  If the session corresponding to the received sid could not be
         found, or it is in the "inactive" state, send a 401-STALE
         response.

      *  If the session is in the "rejected" state, send either a
         401-INIT (*) or a 401-STALE message.

      *  If the session is in the "authenticated" state, and the request
         has an nc value that was previously received from the client,
         send a 401-STALE message.  The session SHOULD be changed to the
         "inactive" status.

      *  If the nc value in the request is larger than the nc-max
         parameter sent from the server, or if it is not larger then
         (largest-nc - nc-window) (when in "authenticated" status), the
         server MAY (but not REQUIRED to) send a 401-STALE message.  The

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


         session SHOULD be changed to the "inactive" status if so.

      *  If the session is a "fake" session, or if the received vkc is
         incorrect, then send a 401-INIT (*) response.  If the session
         is in the "key exchanging" state, it SHOULD be changed to the
         "rejected" state; otherwise, it MAY either be changed to the
         "rejected" status or kept in the previous state.

      *  Otherwise, send a 200-VFY-S response.  If the session was in
         the "key exchanging" state, the session SHOULD be changed to an
         "authenticated" state.  The maximum nc and nc flags of the
         state SHOULD be updated properly.

   At any time, the server MAY change any state entries with both the
   "rejected" and "authenticated" statuses to the "inactive" status, and
   MAY discard any "inactive" states from the table.  The entries with
   the "key exchanging" status SHOULD be kept unless there is an
   emergency situation such as a server reboot or a table capacity
   overflow.

   Note 1: In relation with, and following the specification of the
   optional authentication defined in [I-D.ietf-httpauth-extension], the
   401-INIT messages marked with the asterisks can not be replaced with
   a successful responses with an Optional-WWW-Authenticate header.
   Every other 401-INIT can be a response with an
   Optional-WWW-Authenticate.

   Note 2: the server SHOULD NOT send a 401-INIT response in this case,
   because it will leak the information to the client that the specified
   user will not be accepted.  Instead, postpone it to the response for
   the next req-VFY-C request.


11.  Authentication Algorithms

   Cryptographic authentication algorithms which are used with this
   protocol will be defined separately.  The algorithm definition MUST
   at least provide a definitions for the following functions:

   o  The server-side authentication credential J, derived from user-
      side authentication credential pi.

   o  Key exchange values K_c1, K_s1 (exchanged on wire) and S_c1, S_s1
      (kept secret in each peer).

   o  Shared secret z, to be computed in both server-side and client
      side.




Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   o  A hash function H to be used with the protocol.

   All algorithm used with this protocol SHOULD provide secure mutual
   authentication between client and servers, and generate a
   cryptographically strong shared secret value z, equivalently strong
   to or stronger than the hash function H. If any passwords (or pass-
   phrases or any equivalents, i.e. weak secrets) are involved, these
   SHOULD NOT be guessable from any data transmitted in the protocol,
   even if an attacker (either an eavesdropper or an active server)
   knows the possible thoroughly-searchable candidate list of the
   passwords.  Furthermore, if possible, the function for deriving
   server-side authentication credential J is RECOMMENDED to be one-way
   so that pi should not be easily computed from J(pi).

11.1.  Support Functions and Notations

   In this section we define several support functions and notations to
   be shared by several algorithm definitions:

   The integers in the specification are in decimal, or in hexadecimal
   when prefixed with "0x".

   The function octet(c) generates a single octet string whose code
   value is equal to c.  The operator |, when applied to octet strings,
   denotes the concatenation of two operands.

   The function VI encodes natural numbers into octet strings in the
   following manner: numbers are represented in big-endian radix-128
   string, where each digit is represented by a octet within 0x80-0xff
   except the last digit represented by a octet within 0x00-0x7f.  The
   first octet MUST NOT be 0x80.  For example, VI(i) = octet(i) for i <
   128, and VI(i) = octet(0x80 + (i >> 7)) | octet(i & 127) for 128 <= i
   < 16384.  This encoding is the same as the one used for the
   subcomponents of object identifiers in the ASN.1 encoding
   [ITU.X690.1994], and available as a "w" conversion in the pack
   function of several scripting languages.

   The function VS encodes a variable-length octet string into a
   uniquely-decoded, self-delimited octet string, as in the following
   manner:

   VS(s) = VI(length(s)) | s

   where length(s) is a number of octets (not characters) in s.

   Some examples:





Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 34]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


      VI(0) = "\000" (in C string notation)

      VI(100) = "d"

      VI(10000) = "\316\020"

      VI(1000000) = "\275\204@"

      VS("") = "\000"

      VS("Tea") = "\003Tea"

      VS("Caf<e acute>" [in UTF-8]) = "\005Caf\303\251"

      VS([10000 "a"s]) = "\316\020aaaaa..." (10002 octets)

   (Note: Unlike the colon-separated notion used in the Basic/Digest
   HTTP authentication scheme, the string generated by a concatenation
   of the VS-encoded strings will be unique, regardless of the
   characters included in the strings to be encoded.)

   The function OCTETS converts an integer into the corresponding radix-
   256 big-endian octet string having its natural length: See
   Section 3.1.3 for the definition of "natural length".

   The function INT converts an octet string into a natural number,
   where the input string is treated as a radix-256 big-endian notation.
   The identity INT(OCTETS(n)) = n always holds for any natural number
   n.

11.2.  Default Functions for Algorithms

   The functions defined in this section are common default functions
   among authentication algorithms.

   The client-side password-based (credential) pi used by this
   authentication is a natural number derived in the following manner:

   pi = INT(H(VS(algorithm) | VS(auth-domain) | VS(realm) | VS(username)
   | VS(ph(password)))).

   The values of algorithm, realm, and auth-domain are taken from the
   values contained in the 401-INIT message.  The function ph is
   determined by the value of the pwd-hash parameter given in a 401-INIT
   message.  If the password comes from a user input, it SHOULD first be
   prepared using I-D.oiwa-precis-httpauthprep [RFC4013].  Then, the
   password SHALL be encoded as a UTF-8 string before passed to ph.

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   The values VK_c and VK_s are derived by the following equation.

   VK_c = INT(H(octet(4) | OCTETS(K_c1) | OCTETS(K_s1) | OCTETS(z) |
   VI(nc) | VS(vh)))

   VK_s = INT(H(octet(3) | OCTETS(K_c1) | OCTETS(K_s1) | OCTETS(z) |
   VI(nc) | VS(vh)))

   Specifications for cryptographic algorithms used with this framework
   MAY override the functions pi, VK_c, and VK_s defined above.  In such
   cases implementations MUST use the ones defined with such algorithm
   specifications.


12.  Application Channel Binding

   Applications and upper-layer communication protocols may need
   authentication binding to the HTTP-layer authenticated user.  Such
   applications MAY use the following values as a standard shared
   secret.

   These values are parameterized with an optional octet string (t)
   which may be arbitrarily chosen by each applications or protocols.
   If there is no appropriate value to be specified, use a null string
   for t.

   For applications requiring binding to either an authenticated user or
   a shared-key session (to ensure that the requesting client is
   certainly authenticated), the following value b_1 MAY be used.

   b_1 = H(H(octet(6) | OCTETS(K_c1) | OCTETS(K_s1) | OCTETS(z) | VI(0)
   | VS(vh)) | VS(t)).

   For applications requiring binding to a specific request (to ensure
   that the payload data is generated for the exact HTTP request), the
   following value b_2 MAY be used.

   b_2 = H(H(octet(7) | OCTETS(K_c1) | OCTETS(K_s1) | OCTETS(z) | VI(nc)
   | VS(vh)) | VS(t)).

   Note: Channel bindings to lower-layer transports (TCP and TLS) are
   defined in Section 7.


13.  Application for Proxy Authentication

   The authentication scheme defined by the previous sections can be
   applied (with modifications) for proxy authentications.  In such



Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 36]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   cases, the following alterations MUST be applied:

   o  The 407 status is to be sent and recognized for places where the
      401 status is used,

   o  Proxy-Authenticate: header is to be used for places where WWW-
      Authenticate: is used,

   o  Proxy-Authorization: header is to be used for places where
      Authorization: is used,

   o  Proxy-Authentication-Info: header is to be used for places where
      Authentication-Info: is used,

   o  The auth-domain parameter is fixed to the host-name of the proxy,
      which means to cover all requests processed through the specific
      proxy,

   o  The limitation for the paths contained in the path parameter of
      401-KEX-S1 messages is disregarded,

   o  The omission of the path parameter of 401-KEX-S1 messages means
      that the authentication realm will potentially cover all requests
      processed by the proxy,

   o  The scheme, host name and the port of the proxy is used for host
      validation tokens, and

   o  Authentication extensions in [I-D.ietf-httpauth-extension] are not
      applicable.


14.  Methods to Extend This Protocol

   If a private extension to this protocol is implemented, it MUST use
   the extension-tokens defined in Section 3 to avoid conflicts with
   this protocol and other extensions. (standardized or being-
   standardizing extensions MAY use either bare-tokens or extension-
   tokens.)

   Specifications defining authentication algorithms MAY use other
   representations for the parameters "kc1", "ks1", "vkc", and "vks",
   replace those parameter names, and/or add parameters to the messages
   containing those parameters in supplemental specifications, provided
   that syntactic and semantic requirements in Section 3,
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging] and [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth] are

   and followed by decimal natural numbers (e.g. kc2, ks0, vkc1, vks3

   etc.) are reserved for this purpose.  If those specifications use
   names other than those mentioned above, it is RECOMMENDED to use
   extension-tokens to avoid any parameter name conflict with the future
   extension of this protocol.

   Extension-tokens MAY be freely used for any non-standard, private,
   and/or experimental uses for those parameters provided that the
   domain part in the token is appropriately used.


15.  IANA Considerations

   When bare-tokens are used for the authentication-algorithm, pwd-hash,
   and validation parameters MUST be allocated by IANA.  To acquire
   registered tokens, a specification for the use of such tokens MUST be
   available as an RFC, as outlined in [RFC5226].

   Note: More formal declarations will be added in the future drafts to
   meet the RFC 5226 requirements.


16.  Security Considerations

16.1.  Security Properties

   o  The protocol is secure against passive eavesdropping and replay
      attacks.  However, the protocol relies on transport security
      including DNS integrity for data secrecy and integrity.  HTTP/TLS
      SHOULD be used where transport security is not assured and/or data
      confidentiality is important.

   o  When used with HTTP/TLS, if TLS server certificates are reliably
      verified, the protocol provides true protection against active
      man-in-the-middle attacks.

   o  Even if the server certificate is not used or is unreliable, the
      protocol provides protection against active man-in-the-middle
      attacks for each HTTP request/response pair.  However, in such
      cases, JavaScript or similar scripting facilities can be used to
      affect the Mutually-authenticated contents from other contents not
      protected by this authentication mechanism.  This is the reason
      why this protocol requires that valid TLS server certificates MUST
      be presented (Section 7).

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


16.2.  Denial-of-service Attacks to Servers

   The protocol requires a server-side table of active sessions, which
   may become a critical point of the server resource consumptions.  For
   proper operation, the protocol requires that at least one key
   verification request is processed for each session identifier.  After
   that, servers MAY discard sessions internally at any time, without
   causing any operational problems to clients.  Clients will silently
   reestablishes a new session then.

   However, if a malicious client sends too many requests of key
   exchanges (req-KEX-C1 messages) only, resource starvation might
   occur.  In such critical situations, servers MAY discard any kind of
   existing sessions regardless of these statuses.  One way to mitigate
   such attacks are that servers MAY have a number and a time limits for
   unverified pending key exchange requests (in the "key exchanging"
   status).

   This is a common weakness of authentication protocols with almost any
   kind of negotiations or states, including Digest authentication
   method and most Cookie-based authentication implementations.
   However, regarding the resource consumption, a situation of the
   mutual authentication method is a slightly better than the Digest,
   because HTTP requests without any kind of authentication requests
   will not generate any kind of sessions.  Session identifiers are only
   generated after a client starts a key negotiation.  It means that
   simple clients such as web crawlers will not accidentally consume
   server-side resources for session managements.

16.2.1.  On-line Active Password Attacks

   Although the protocol provides very strong protection against off-
   line dictionary attacks from eavesdropped traffics, the protocol, by
   its nature, can not prevent an active password attacks which the
   attackers sends so many authentication trial requests for every
   possible passwords.

   Possible countermeasures for preventing such attacks may be rate-
   limiting of the password authentication trials, statistics-based
   intrusion detection measures or similar protection schemes.  If the
   server operators assume that the passwords of users are not strong
   enough, it may be desirable to introduce such ad-hoc countermeasures.

16.3.  Communicating the status of mutual authentication with users

   This protocol is designed for two goals.  The first goal is just
   providing a secure alternative for existing Basic and Digest
   authentication.  The second goal is to provide users a way to detect



Oiwa, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                [Page 39]

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


   forged rogue servers imitating user's registered account on server-
   side, commonly known as (a part or kind of) Phishing attacks.

   For this protocol to effectively work as some countermeasures to such
   attacks, it is very important that end users of clients will be
   notified of the result of mutual authentication performed by this
   protocol, especially the three states "AUTH-SUCCEED",
   "UNAUTHENTICATED" and "AUTH-REQUIRED" defined in Section 9.  The
   design of secure users' interfaces of the HTTP interactive clients
   are out of the scope of this document, but if possible, having some
   kind of UI indication for the three states above will be desirable
   for user's benefits on their security.

   Of course, in such cases, the user interfaces for asking passwords
   for this authentication shall be clearly identifiable against
   imitation by other insecure password input fields (such as forms).
   If the passwords are known to malicious attackers outside of the
   protocol, the protocol can not work as an effective security
   measures.

16.4.  Implementation Considerations

   o  To securely implement the protocol, the Authentication-Info
      headers in the 200-VFY-S messages MUST always be validated by the
      client.  If the validation fails, the client MUST NOT process any
      content sent with the message, including other headers and the
      body part.  Non-compliance to this requirement will allow phishing
      attacks.

   o  For HTTP/TLS communications, when a web form is submitted from
      Mutually-authenticated pages with the "tls-server-end-point"
      validation method to a URI that is protected by the same realm (so
      indicated by the path parameter), if the server certificate has
      been changed since the pages were received, the peer is
      RECOMMENDED to be revalidated using a req-KEX-C1 message with an
      "Expect: 100-continue" header.  The same applies when the page is
      received with the "tls-unique" validation method, and when the TLS
      session has expired.

   o  For better protection against possible password database steal,
      Server-side storages of user passwords are better containing the
      values encrypted by one-way function J(pi), instead of the real
      passwords, those hashed by ph, or pi.

Internet-Draft   Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP    October 2013


16.5.  Usage Considerations

   o  The user-names inputted by a user may be sent automatically to any
      servers sharing the same auth-domain.  This means that when host-
      type auth-domain is used for authentication on an HTTPS site, and
      when an HTTP server on the same host requests Mutual
      authentication within the same realm, the client will send the
      user-name in a clear text.  If user-names have to be kept secret
      against eavesdropping, the server must use full-scheme-type auth-
      domain parameter and HTTPS.  Contrarily, passwords are not exposed
      to eavesdroppers even on HTTP requests.

   o  The "pwd-hash" parameter is only provided for backward
      compatibility of password databases.  The use of "none" function
      is the most secure choice and is RECOMMENDED.  If values other
      than "none" are used, you MUST ensure that the hash values of the
      passwords were not exposed to the public.  Note that hashed
      password databases for plain-text authentications are usually not
      considered secret.

   o  If the server provides several ways for storing server-side
      password secrets into the password database, it is desirable for
      better security to store the values encrypted by using the one-way
      function J(pi), instead of the real passwords, those hashed by ph,
      or pi.

B.3.  Changes in HttpBis Revision 00

   None.

B.4.  Changes in Revision 12

   o  Added a reason "authz-failed".

B.5.  Changes in Revision 11

   o  Message syntax definition reverted to pre-07 style as httpbis-p1
      and p7 now defines a precise rule for parameter value parsing.

   o  Replaced "stale" parameter with more infomative/extensive "reason"
      parameter in 401-INIT and 401-STALE.

   o  Reserved "rekey-sid" and "rekey-method" parameters for future
      extensions.

   o  Added descriptions for replacing/non-replacing existing
      technologies.

B.6.  Changes in Revision 10

   o  The authentication extension parts (non-mandatory authentication
      and authentication controls) are separated to yet another draft.

   o  The default auth-domain parameter is changed to the full scheme-
      host-port syntax, which is consistent with usual HTTP
      authentication framework behavior.

   o  Provision for application channel binding is added.

   o  Provision for proxy access authentication is added.

   o  Bug fix: syntax specification of sid parameter was wrong: it was
      inconsistent with the type specified in the main text (the bug
      introduced in -07 draft).

   o  Terminologies for headers are changed to be in harmony with
      httpbis drafts (e.g. field to parameter).

   o  Syntax definitions are changed to use HTTP-extended ABNF syntax,
      and only the header values are shown for header syntax, in harmony
      with httpbis drafts.

   o  Names of parameters and corresponding mathematical values are now
      renamed to more informative ones.  The following list shows
