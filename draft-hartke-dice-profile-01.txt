               A DTLS Profile for the Internet of Things
                      draft-hartke-dice-profile-01

Abstract

   This document defines a DTLS profile that is suitable for Internet of
   Things applications and is reasonably implementable on many
   constrained devices.

Disclaimer

   This is a very early, very rough draft.  At this stage, the draft is
   not intended to make any specific proposal for a profile, but aims to
   create a shared understanding of what a DTLS profile defines.  No
   security analysis has been performed.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] profile that enables
   secure and private exchange of information in Internet of Things
   applications and is reasonably implementable on many constrained
   devices.

   o  One-stop list of RFCs to be implemented.

   o  No changes to TLS or DTLS.

   o  No new extensions defined by the profile.

   o  No negotiation of the profile between client and server.

   o  Profile avoids doing things the TLS WG decided not to do.

   o  Profile aligns with the DTLS security modes of the Constrained
      Application Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   o  Profile takes advantage of existing hardware support where
      possible.

   o  Document includes a brief discussion of extensions not included.
