                          DNSSEC Validator API
              draft-hayatnagarkar-dnsext-validator-api-09

Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide origin authentication
   and integrity of DNS data.  However, the current resolver Application
   Programming Interface (API) does not specify how a validating stub
   resolver should communicate results of DNSSEC processing back to the
   application.  This document describes an API between applications and
   a validating stub resolver that allows applications to control the
   DNSSEC validation process and obtain results of DNSSEC processing.

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The DNS Security Extensions ([refs.RFC4033], [refs.RFC4034],
   [refs.RFC4035]) enable DNS resolvers to test the origin authenticity
   and integrity of data returned by the DNS.  A DNSSEC validator, or
   more formally, a validating stub resolver, is a piece of software
   that performs these tests by constructing an authentication chain
   [refs.RFC4033] from a locally configured DNSSEC trust anchor
   [refs.RFC4033] to a cryptographic signature that covers the DNS
   information in question.  This document presents an API between an
   application and a DNSSEC validator, which enables applications to
   control the DNSSEC validation process and enables applications to
   obtain DNSSEC validation results upon which to base program behavior.

   The API can be broadly divided into three groups: the high-level
   DNSSEC validator API, the low-level DNSSEC validator API and the
   DNSSEC validator-context API.  Section 3, Section 4, and Section 6
   describe these groups in greater detail.

   The high-level DNSSEC validator API is designed for ease of use and
   mirrors existing DNS-related functions.  This API is best suited for
   existing applications that use legacy DNS functions such as
   gethostbyname() and getaddrinfo() [refs.IEEE.1003.1-2004] and have no
   requirement for detailed DNSSEC validation status information.

   The low-level DNSSEC validator API enables applications to examine
   the DNSSEC validation details for each element of the DNSSEC
   authentication chain.

   The DNSSEC validator-context API enables applications to control the
   DNSSEC policies that are used for validating DNS responses.

   The range of functions provided in this API supports different
   classes of applications, ranging from those that are only interested
   in basic DNSSEC results to more sophisticated applications that can
   look for specific errors in an authentication chain as a sign of some
   abnormality or attack.


2.  Terminology

   Some of the terms used in this specification are defined below:

   Legacy DNS Functions:  existing functions, such as gethostbyname()
      and getaddrinfo(), which are not capable of returning DNSSEC
      validation status codes for DNS responses.

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012



   DNSSEC Validator Policy:  a set of configuration parameters for the
      DNSSEC validator, which can influence the eventual outcome of the
      DNSSEC validation process.

   DNSSEC Validator Context:  the application's run-time handle to the
      DNSSEC validator policy.


3.  High-level DNSSEC Validator API

   The high-level DNSSEC validator API defines DNSSEC-aware substitutes
   for commonly used legacy DNS functions.  It provides an easy path for
   applications already using legacy DNS functions to transition towards
   becoming DNSSEC-aware.  This API also defines the val_get_rrset()
   function, which enables applications to obtain data for an arbitrary
   DNS name, class and type, and inspect the corresponding DNSSEC
   validation status value(s).

   A number of legacy DNS functions exist; however, some of these
   functions (such as gethostbyname_r and gethostbyname2) are only
   available on a subset of Operating Systems and are not part of any
   official standard.  Also, some functions are defined as minor
   extensions of other well-known legacy DNS functions.  For example,
   gethostbyname2 differs from gethostbyname_r only by virtue of having
   the extra argument to explictly specify the address family.  Further,
   some functions differ from others only by virtue of being able to
   support a re-entrant and thread-safe implementation.  Instead of
   providing an exhaustive list of DNSSEC-capable replacement functions
   for all known resolver function calls, the high-level DNSSEC
   validator API in this document only describes DNSSEC extensions for
   the canonical set of function calls specified in
   [refs.IEEE.1003.1-2004].  DNSSEC replacement functions for other
   legacy DNS functions are expected to mirror, to a large extent, other
   functions described in this document.

   The ctx parameter in the functions described in this API points to a
   DNSSEC validator context object (see Section 6).  Applications MUST
   either supply a reference to a valid DNSSEC validator context object
   created using the functions specified in Section 6 or supply a NULL
   value for this parameter.  Libraries that implement the DNSSEC
   Validator API MUST internally use a default DNSSEC validator context
   when the application supplies a NULL value for ctx.

3.1.  val_gethostbyname, val_gethostbyaddr

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   struct hostent *val_gethostbyname( val_context_t *ctx,
                                      const char    *name,
                                      val_status_t  *val_status );

   struct hostent *val_gethostbyaddr( val_context_t *ctx,
                                      const char    *addr,
                                      int            len,
                                      int            type,
                                      val_status_t  *val_status );

   The val_gethostbyname() and val_gethostbyaddr() functions are DNSSEC-
   aware versions of the gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() legacy DNS
   functions.

   The new functions have an additional parameter, val_status, which
   enables applications to check the DNSSEC validation status codes for
   the address-to-name and name-to-address translations.  The other
   arguments to these functions and their return values have identical
   semantics to the corresponding legacy DNS functions as described in
   [refs.IEEE.1003.1-2004].  The val_gethostbyname() and
   val_gethostbyaddr() functions SHOULD only be used when retrofitting
   DNSSEC in existing applications that use the gethostbyname() and
   gethostbyaddr() functions.  For new applications that need to perform
   these translations, the functions described in Section 3.2 and
   Section 3.4 SHOULD be used instead.

   The DNSSEC validation status is returned in the val_status parameter.
   When evaluating the validity of a DNS response, applications SHOULD
   use the functions described in Section 8.2 instead of directly
   inspecting the DNSSEC validation status code returned in val_status.

   The status code returned in val_status is determined by the following
   rules.
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_OOB_ANSWER MUST be returned if
      the complete answer is returned using some out-of-band mechanism
      (for example, from a local configuration store such as /etc/hosts
      or its equivalent) without any DNSSEC validation being performed.
      However, if local DNSSEC validator policy defines out-of-band
      answers to be trustworthy, a DNSSEC validation status of
      VAL_TRUSTED_ANSWER SHOULD be returned instead.
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_VALIDATED_ANSWER MUST be
      returned if all addresses and canonical names within the hostent
      structure are validated successfully.

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012


   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_TRUSTED_ANSWER MUST be returned
      if at least one address or canonical name within the hostent
      structure is not validated by the DNSSEC validation process, but
      all answers are still considered trustworthy (see Section 6) by
      way of the configured local DNSSEC validator policy.
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_UNTRUSTED_ANSWER MUST be
      returned if at least one address or canonical name within the
      hostent structure is neither validated through the DNSSEC
      validation process nor considered to be trusted according to the
      configured local DNSSEC validator policy.
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME or
      VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE MUST be returned if the DNSSEC validation
      process is able to prove non-existence for the name or type being
      queried for.  A DNSSEC validation status of
      VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME_NOCHAIN or VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE_NOCHAIN MUST
      be returned if a DNS response with an RCODE reflecting type or
      name non-existence is returned, and local DNSSEC validator policy
      is configured to treat such answers as trustworthy.  If the
      previous two conditions for non-existence are not satisfied,
      val_status MUST be set to VAL_UNTRUSTED_ANSWER.

3.2.  val_getaddrinfo, val_freeaddrinfo, val_getnameinfo

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_getaddrinfo( val_context_t          *ctx,
                        const char             *nodename,
                        const char             *servname,
                        const struct addrinfo  *hints,
                        struct addrinfo       **res ,
                        val_status_t           *val_status);

   void val_freeaddrinfo( struct addrinfo     *res);

   int val_getnameinfo( val_context_t         *ctx,
                        const struct sockaddr *sa,
                        socklen_t              salen,
                        char                  *host,
                        size_t                 hostlen,
                        char                  *serv,
                        size_t                 servlen,
                        int                    flags,
                        val_status_t          *val_status );


   These functions are DNSSEC-aware versions of the getaddrinfo(),
   freeaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() legacy DNS functions
   ([refs.RFC3493]) respectively.

   The val_getaddrinfo() function returns the address and service
   information for the specified domain name and service.  The
   val_freaddrinfo() function releases the memory used by the struct
   addrinfo returned in the res parameter when calling val_getaddrinfo.
   The val_getnameinfo() function performs an address-to-name
   translation in a protocol independent manner.

   The value of res MUST point to a valid addrinfo structure
   ([refs.RFC3493]) on a successful return from the val_getaddrinfo()
   function or NULL in case of error.  Sufficient memory MUST be
   internally allocated to hold the linked list pointed to by res.  This
   memory MUST be released when applications invoke the freeaddrinfo()
   function. ([refs.RFC3493]).

   The DNSSEC validation status is returned in the val_status parameter.
   When evaluating the validity of a DNS response, applications SHOULD
   use the functions described in Section 8.2 instead of directly
   inspecting the DNSSEC validation status code returned in val_status.
   The syntax and semantics of other parameters in val_getaddrinfo() and
   val_getnameinfo() and their return values are identical to those
   specified for getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() in [refs.RFC3493].

   The status code returned in val_status is determined by the following
   rules.
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_OOB_ANSWER MUST be returned in
      val_status if the complete answer is returned using some out-of-
      band mechanism (for example, from a local configuration store such
      as /etc/hosts or its equivalent) without any DNSSEC validation
      being performed.  However, if local DNSSEC validator policy
      defines out-of-band answers to be trustworthy, a DNSSEC validation
      status of VAL_TRUSTED_ANSWER SHOULD be returned instead.
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_VALIDATED_ANSWER MUST be
      returned in val_status if the hostname returned by
      val_getnameinfo(), or all addresses and canonical names returned
      by val_getaddrinfo(), are validated through the DNSSEC process.
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_TRUSTED_ANSWER MUST be returned
      in val_status if the hostname returned by val_getnameinfo(), or at
      least one address or canonical name returned by val_getaddrinfo(),
      is not validated by the DNSSEC validation process but all answers
      are still considered to be trustworthy through the local DNSSEC
      validator policy (see Section 6).
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_UNTRUSTED_ANSWER MUST be
      returned if at least one address or canonical name returned by
      val_getaddrinfo() within the addrinfo structure, or the returned
      hostname in val_getnameinfo(), is neither validated through the
      DNSSEC process nor considered to be trustworthy according to the
      local DNSSEC validator policy.

   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME or
      VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE MUST be returned in val_status if the DNSSEC
      validation process is able to prove non-existence for the name or
      type being queried for.  A DNSSEC validation status of
      VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME_NOCHAIN or VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE_NOCHAIN MUST
      be returned if a DNS response with an RCODE reflecting type or
      name non-existence is returned, and local DNSSEC validator policy
      is configured to treat such answers as trustworthy (Section 6).
      If the previous two conditions for non-existence are not
      satisfied, val_status MUST be set to VAL_UNTRUSTED_ANSWER.

3.3.  val_res_query

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_res_query(val_context_t *ctx,
                     const char    *domain_name,
                     int            class,
                     int            type,
                     unsigned char *answer,
                     int            anslen,
                     val_status_t  *val_status);


   The val_res_query() function is a DNSSEC-aware replacement for the
   res_query() function (currently not documented in any standard
   reference).

   The val_res_query() function queries the DNS for the data associated
   with the given domain name, class and type, and returns the resulting
   resource record sets in a DNS-style response.

   The val_res_query() function MUST return the actual size of the
   response packet on success and -1 on failure.  On success, the
   response from the DNS MUST be copied to the user-allocated buffer in
   answer and MUST NOT exceed the buffer size specified in anslen.

   The DNSSEC validation status is returned in the val_status parameter.
   When evaluating the validity of a DNS response, applications SHOULD
   use the functions described in Section 8.2 instead of directly
   inspecting the DNSSEC validation status code returned in val_status.

   The status code returned in val_status is determined by the following
   rules.
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_VALIDATED_ANSWER MUST be
      returned if all resource record sets returned in the answer are
      validated by the DNSSEC validation process.

   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_TRUSTED_ANSWER MUST be returned
      if at least one resource record set returned in the answer is not
      validated by the DNSSEC validation process, but all resource
      record sets are still considered to be trustworthy according to
      the configured local DNSSEC validator policy (see Section 6).
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_UNTRUSTED_ANSWER MUST be
      returned if at least one resource record set in the answer is
      neither validated through the DNSSEC validation process nor
      considered to be trustworthy according to the local DNSSEC
      validator policy.
   o  A DNSSEC validation status of VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME or
      VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE MUST be returned if the DNSSEC validation
      process is able to prove non-existence for the name or type being
      queried for.  A DNSSEC validation status of
      VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME_NOCHAIN or VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE_NOCHAIN MUST
      be returned if a DNS response with an RCODE reflecting type or
      name non-existence is returned, and local DNSSEC validator policy
      is configured to treat such answers as trustworthy.  If the
      previous two conditions for non-existence are not satisfied,
      val_status MUST be set to VAL_UNTRUSTED_ANSWER.

3.4.  val_get_rrset

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_get_rrset(val_context_t            *ctx,
                     const char               *name,

                     int                       type,

                     struct val_answer_chain **answers);

   void val_free_answer_chain(struct val_answer_chain *answers);


   The val_get_rrset() function queries the DNS for the data associated
   with the given domain name, class and type.  The flags argument
   specifies a list of options to the validation process, logically OR'd
   to each other.  This possible flags are defined in Section 4.1.
   val_get_rrset() MUST return 0 on success and an error code from
   Section 7 on failure.

   val_get_rrset() MUST return its results in the val_answer_chain
   structure after allocating sufficient memory for this structure.
   Applications MUST release this memory after use by invoking the
   val_free_answer_chain() function.

   The val_answer_chain structure is defined below.

   struct val_answer_chain {
         val_status_t             val_ans_status;
         char                    *val_ans_name;
         int                      val_ans_class;
         int                      val_ans_type;
         struct rr_rec           *val_ans;
         struct val_answer_chain *val_ans_next;
   };

   struct rr_rec {
         size_t         rr_length;
         unsigned char *rr_data;
         struct rr_rec *rr_next;
   };

   val_ans_name MUST be set to the DNS name of the actual resource
   record set returned.  This value may differ from the name argument in
   val_get_rrset() if the resource record is returned after following a
   CNAME ([refs.RFC1034]) or DNAME ([refs.RFC2672]) alias. val_ans_class
   and val_ans_type MUST be set to the actual class and type for the
   returned resource record.  These values may differ from the class and
   type arguments in val_get_rrset() if the query type or class has the
   value 255 (ANY).  The resource record sets MUST be returned in
   val_ans as a linked list of rr_rec structures, with each element
   containing the rr_length and rr_data tuple for a resource record in
   the resource record set. val_ans MUST be set to NULL if no answer was
   returned for the given query or if a proof of non-existence was
   returned.

   The DNSSEC validation status code is returned in the val_ans_status
   field.  Since validation status codes returned by val_get_rrset() are
   available per resource record set, the set of possible values for
   val_ans_status is more granular than that possible for the val_status
   field in other high-level API functions.  The list of possible codes
   for val_ans_status are listed in Section 8.1.  When evaluating the
   validity of a DNS response, applications SHOULD use the functions
   described in Section 8.2 instead of directly inspecting the DNSSEC
   validation status code returned in val_ans_status.


4.  Low-level DNSSEC Validator API

   The low-level DNSSEC validator API provides applications with greater
   control and visibility into the DNSSEC validation process.  The
   functions and data structures defined in the low-level DNSSEC
   validator API are summarized below.

4.1.  val_resolve_and_check, val_free_result_chain

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_resolve_and_check( val_context_t               *ctx,
                              const char                  *domain_name,
                              int                          class,
                              int                          type,
                              unsigned int                 flags,
                              struct val_result_chain    **results);

   void val_free_result_chain(struct val_result_chain *results);


   The val_resolve_and_check() function queries the DNS for the
   <domain_name, class, type> tuple and then performs the DNSSEC
   validation operation for the responses received.  The
   val_free_result_chain() function releases the resources allocated for
   the returned result.

   The flags argument specifies a list of options to the validation
   process, logically OR'd to each other.  The following flags are
   defined; their values are implementation-specific:

   VAL_QUERY_AC_DETAIL:  If this flag is specified, the complete
      authentication chain MUST be returned for each answer within the
      val_result_chain structure.  If this flag is not set then only the
      rrset information corresponding to the answer or proof of non-
      existence for the queried name, domain_name SHOULD be returned
      within the val_result_chain structure.
   VAL_QUERY_DONT_VALIDATE:  If this flag is specified, validation
      processing MUST be ignored for the given name.  Any resulting
      answer will have a validation status value of
      VAL_IGNORE_VALIDATION.
   VAL_QUERY_IGNORE_SKEW:  If this flag is specified, signature
      inception and expiration times MUST be ignored for RRSIGs in the
      authentication chain.
   VAL_QUERY_NO_DLV:  If this flag is specified, Dynamic Look-aside
      Validation (DLV) [refs.DLV] processing for this name MUST NOT be
      performed.
   VAL_QUERY_ASYNC:  If this flag is specified, this name MUST be
      resolved through the asynchronous lookup process (see Section 5).
   VAL_QUERY_RECURSE:  If this flag is specified, the name MUST be
      looked up by directly querying the authoritative name server for
      that name (which may involve iteratively querying various name
      servers in the delegation hierarchy) instead of requesting this
      information from any caching name server that may be specified as
      configuration data.

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012


   VAL_QUERY_NO_EDNS0_FALLBACK:  If this flag is specified, re-trying
      the query with smaller EDNS0 advertised window sizes MUST NOT be
      attempted as a fallback strategy.
   VAL_QUERY_SKIP_RESOLVER:  If this flag is specified, only the cache
      should be consulted while looking up a name.  New queries MUST NOT
      be sent on the wire as part of looking up and validating the
      cached answer.
   VAL_QUERY_SKIP_CACHE:  If this flag is specified, any locally cached
      information for the name being looked up MUST be ignored.

   val_resolve_and_check() MUST return 0 on success and an error code
   from Section 7 on failure.  Answers to the query MUST be returned in
   results, which is a linked list of val_result_chain structures, as
   defined below. val_resolve_and_check() MUST allocate sufficient
   memory to hold the contents of results.  This memory MUST be released
   when applications invoke the val_free_result_chain() function.


   #define MAX_PROOFS 4
   struct val_result_chain {
         val_status_t                     val_rc_status;
         char                            *val_rc_alias;
         struct val_rrset_rec            *val_rc_rrset;
         struct val_authentication_chain *val_rc_answer;
         int                              val_rc_proof_count;
         struct val_authentication_chain *val_rc_proofs[MAX_PROOFS];
         struct val_result_chain         *val_rc_next;
   };


   Each element in the val_result_chain linked list MUST point to a
   distinct resource record set returned in the response.  Multiple
   resource record sets can be returned in a response when the query is
   for the type code of 255 (ANY) or 46 (RRSIG).  The val_rc_next field
   enables an application to iterate through the list of all results
   returned by the DNSSEC validator.  For all val_result_chain elements
   that represent a name alias, val_rc_alias MUST point to the target
   name referenced by that alias.

   val_rc_answer SHOULD point to a resource record in the answer
   portion; all associated proofs of non-existence (either in support of
   the answer in val_rc_answer or to prove the non-existence of a
   record) SHOULD be returned in val_rc_proofs. val_rc_proof_count MUST
   be set to the number of proof elements that are available.
   val_rc_answer and val_rc_proofs SHOULD be NULL if the
   VAL_QUERY_AC_DETAIL flag is not specified in the flags argument for
   val_resolve_and_check().

   val_rc_rrset MUST point to resource record set information for the
   current element in the val_result_chain linked list.  If no answers
   are returned (or a proof of non-existence is returned) in response to
   the query, val_rc_rrset MUST be set to NULL.

   The DNSSEC validation status code is returned in the val_rc_status
   field.  Since validation status codes are available per resource
   record set, it is possible to have a highly granular set of values
   for val_rc_status.  Possible codes for val_rc_status are listed in
   Section 8.1.  When evaluating the validity of a DNS response,
   applications SHOULD use the functions described in Section 8.2
   instead of directly inspecting the DNSSEC validation status code
   returned in val_rc_status.

   The val_authentication_chain structure represents a linked list whose
   elements comprise the DNSSEC authentication chain for an answer or
   proof of non-existence resource record set.

   struct val_authentication_chain {
       val_astatus_t                    val_ac_status;
       struct val_rrset_rec            *val_ac_rrset;
       struct val_authentication_chain *val_ac_trust;
   };

   The DNSSEC validation status for the specified resource record set
   MUST be set in the val_ac_status field.  Possible codes for this
   field are defined in Section 4.2.  The val_ac_trust field MUST point
   to the next element in the authentication chain proceeding from the
   signed record towards a DNSSEC trust anchor.  For an element with
   type DNSKEY, the next element MUST correspond to a DS record in the
   parent zone and for a DS record the next element MUST correspond to
   the DNSKEY in the same zone as the DS record.  The value of
   val_ac_trust MUST be set to NULL if either the current element in the
   linked list points to a valid DNSSEC trust anchor or if an error
   condition is encountered.  The validation status code stored in the
   val_ac_status field can be used to differentiate between different
   error conditions.

   The val_ac_rrset field in the val_authentication_chain structure MUST
   point to a val_rrset_rec structure holding the actual resource record
   set fields ([refs.RFC1034]) as described below.

   struct val_rrset_rec {
       int                 val_rrset_rcode;
       char                *val_rrset_name;
       int                 val_rrset_class;
       int                 val_rrset_type;

       struct val_rr_rec   *val_rrset_data;
       struct val_rr_rec   *val_rrset_sig;
   };

   The information stored in the val_rrset_rec structure includes the
   DNS response error code in the val_rrset_rcode field, and the DNS
   response "envelope" comprising of the name, class, type and time-to-
   live tuple in the val_rrset_name, val_rrset_class, val_rrset_type and
   val_rrset_ttl fields respectively.  Additionally, the name server
   from where this resource record set was received MUST be stored in
   the sockaddr data structure ([refs.IEEE.1003.1-2004]) pointed to by
   the val_rrset_server field.  The section where the resource record
   set appeared in the DNS response MUST be saved in the
   val_rrset_section field within the val_rrset_rec structure, and MUST
   be set to one of the following values:

   #define VAL_FROM_ANSWER 1  /* if the resource record set was present
      in the answer section of the DNS response. */

   #define VAL_FROM_AUTHORITY 2  /* if the resource record set was
      present in the authority section of the DNS response. */

   #define VAL_FROM_ADDITIONAL 3  /* if the resource record set was
      present in the additional section of the DNS response. */

   The data returned for the resource record set MUST be queued to
   val_rrset_data.  Any associated RRSIGs MUST be queued to
   val_rrset_sig.  Both of these variables MUST point to lists of struct
   val_rr_rec elements, which specify the resource record data and the
   DNSSEC validation status for each resource-record within the resource
   record set as defined below.

   struct val_rr_rec {
       size_t               rr_rdata_length;
       unsigned char       *rr_rdata;
       struct val_rr_rec   *rr_next;
       val_astatus_t        rr_status;
   };

   The rr_status member in val_rr_rec is only relevant for the

   signatures present in val_rrset_sig or when val_rrset_data points to
   DNSKEY or DS resource records.  In other cases the value of this
   field MUST be set to VAL_AC_UNSET.  The rr_status field takes on a
   subset of all status codes possible for the val_astatus_t type and is
   further described in Section 4.2.

4.2.  Authentication Chain Status Codes and p_ac_status()

   For each authentication chain element in the val_authentication_chain
   structure, the val_ac_status field MUST contain one of the following
   codes:

   VAL_AC_UNSET:  The DNSSEC validation status for the resource record
      set could not be determined.

   VAL_AC_IGNORE_VALIDATION:  DNSSEC validation for the given resource
      record set was ignored on the basis of some configured DNSSEC
      validator policy.

   VAL_AC_UNTRUSTED_ZONE:  The resource record set belonged to a zone
      that the DNSSEC validator considered to be un-trusted, with no
      further DNSSEC validation being deemed necessary.

   VAL_AC_PINSECURE:  The resource record set belonged to a zone for
      which the DS record was provably absent.

   VAL_AC_BARE_RRSIG:  The resource record set contained only RRSIGs (in
      response to a query of type RRSIG).  RRSIGs contain the
      cryptographic signatures for other DNS data and cannot themselves
      be validated.

   VAL_AC_NO_LINK:  No DNSSEC trust anchor was configured at or above
      the level of the authentication chain could be found above this
      point, therefore no validation could be performed.

   VAL_AC_TRUST:  At least one of the signatures covering the given
      resource record set was directly verified using a key that was
      configured as a DNSSEC trust anchor.

   VAL_AC_RRSIG_MISSING:  RRSIG data for the given resource record set
      could not be located.

   VAL_AC_DNSKEY_MISSING:  The DNSKEY data that generated signatures for
      the given resource record set could not be located.

   VAL_AC_DS_MISSING:  The DS data for the DNSKEY resource record set in
      question could not be located.

   VAL_AC_DATA_MISSING:  The returned resource record set was empty.

   VAL_AC_DNS_ERROR:  A DNS error was encountered during the query
      resolution process.

   VAL_AC_NOT_VERIFIED:  None of the RRSIGs covering the given resource
      record set could be verified.

   VAL_AC_VERIFIED:  At least one RRSIG covering the resource record set
      verified successfully.

   For each signature val_rr_rec member within an authentication chain
   pointed to by val_ac_rrset, the DNSSEC validation status stored in
   the variable rr_status MUST be set to one of the following codes:

   VAL_AC_UNSET:  No DNSSEC validation status information could be
      obtained for the given signature.

   VAL_AC_RRSIG_VERIFIED:  The RRSIG verified successfully.

   VAL_AC_WCARD_VERIFIED:  The RRSIG covering a resource record proved
      that the record was wildcard expanded.

   VAL_AC_RRSIG_VERIFIED_SKEW:  The RRSIG verified successfully only
      after clock skew was taken into consideration.

   VAL_AC_WCARD_VERIFIED_SKEW:  The RRSIG covering a resource record
      proved that the record was wildcard expanded, but only after clock
      skew was taken into consideration.

   VAL_AC_WRONG_LABEL_COUNT:  The number of labels on the signature was
      greater than the count given in the RRSIG resource record data.

   VAL_AC_INVALID_RRSIG:  The RRSIG could not be parsed.

   VAL_AC_RRSIG_NOTYETACTIVE:  The RRSIG's inception time was in the
      future.

   VAL_AC_RRSIG_EXPIRED:  The RRSIG's expiration time was in the past.

   VAL_AC_ALGORITHM_NOT_SUPPORTED:  The RRSIG algorithm was not
      supported.

   VAL_AC_RRSIG_VERIFY_FAILED:  The RRSIG could not be verified.

   VAL_AC_RRSIG_ALGORITHM_MISMATCH:  The keytag referenced in the RRSIG
      matched a DNSKEY but the algorithms were different.

   VAL_AC_DNSKEY_NOMATCH:  The DNSKEY that created the given signature
      could not be found in the zone DNSKEY resource record set.

   For each val_rr_rec member of type DNSKEY (or DS where indicated)
   within an authentication chain structure pointed to by val_ac_rrset,
   the DNSSEC validation status stored in the variable rr_status MUST be
   set to one of the following codes:

   VAL_AC_UNSET:  No DNSSEC validation status information could be
      obtained for the given DNSKEY or DS record.

   VAL_AC_TRUST_POINT:  The given DNSKEY or DS record was configured as
      a DNSSEC trust anchor.

   VAL_AC_SIGNING_KEY:  The given DNSKEY was used for generating an
      RRSIG for a resource record in the authentication chain.

   VAL_AC_VERIFIED_LINK:  The given DNSKEY or DS resource record
      provided the link in the authentication chain from a DNSSEC trust
      anchor to the signed record.

   VAL_AC_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM_LINK:  The DNSKEY chained up to a DS record
      but the DNSKEY algorithm was unknown.

   VAL_AC_UNKNOWN_DNSKEY_PROTOCOL:  The DNSKEY protocol number was
      unknown.

   VAL_AC_ALGORITHM_NOT_SUPPORTED:  The DNSKEY or DS algorithm was not
      supported.

   VAL_AC_DS_NOMATCH:  The given DNSKEY did not chain up to any DS
      record in the parent zone.

   VAL_AC_INVALID_KEY:  The given DNSKEY was invalid.

   VAL_AC_INVALID_DS:  The given DS was invalid.

   The numerical values for the codes listed above are implementation-
   specific.  The p_ac_status() function is used to convert the DNSSEC
   validation status code stored in struct val_authentication_chain to a

   string representation.

       #include <validator/validator.h>

       const char *p_ac_status(val_astatus_t status);

   The value returned MAY be the string conversion for the corresponding
   val_astatus_t identifier.  For example, the return value from
   p_ac_status(VAL_AC_VERIFIED) MAY be "VAL_AC_VERIFIED".


5.  Low-level Asynchronous DNSSEC Validator API

   The low-level Asynchronous DNSSEC validator API allows an application
   to submit multiple requests which can be processed in parallel.  In
   most cases, this will result in validation completing much sooner
   than a series of synchronous requests.

   When submitting an asynchronous request, an application may specify a
   callback function to be called when the request completes.

   Since DNSSEC validation of a domain name involves multiple queries,
   applications must periodically give time to the API for processing
   responses and sending additional queries.  (See
   val_async_check_wait() in Section 5.1.3.)

   The functions and data structures defined in the low-level
   Asynchronous DNSSEC validator API are summarized below.

5.1.  Asynchronous Requests

5.1.1.  val_async_submit

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_async_submit(val_context_t *ctx, const char *domain_name,
                        int class, int type, unsigned int flags,
                        val_async_event_cb *callback,
                        void *user_context,
                        val_async_status **async_status);

   The val_async_submit() function submits a request for asynchronous
   processing of DNS queries for the data associated with the given
   domain name, class and type.

   If specified, the given callback function will be called when results
   become available.  Some flags, defined below, can affect when and how
   often the callback is called.

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012


   The specified user context will also be passed to the callback
   function.  More information on the callback function and user_context
   can be found in Section 5.2.

   The val_async_submit() function MUST return VAL_NO_ERROR on success
   and return a pointer to a newly allocated async_status object via the
   async_status parameter.  More information on async_status objects can
   be found in Section 5.3.

   On failure, the return code will be one of VAL_RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE,
   VAL_BAD_ARGUMENT or VAL_INTERNAL_ERROR.  The function MUST release
   any allocated data, and MUST NOT return a value via the async_status
   parameter.  An implementation MAY set async_status to NULL.

   The following flags may be set for the request.  The numerical values
   for the flags are implementation-specific.


   VAL_AS_IGNORE_CACHE:  Don't use any internal cache for answers to
      this query.  Answers MUST be from fresh responses to all queries.
      These new answers MAY be stored in the internal cache for use with
      future queries.

   VAL_AS_NO_NEW_QUERIES:  Don't send any new queries.  Answers MUST
      come from the internal cache.

   VAL_AS_NO_ANSWERS:  Caller doesn't care about the answer results.
      This can be used for priming the cache.

   VAL_AS_NO_CALLBACKS:  Don't call any callbacks.

   VAL_AS_NO_CANCEL_CALLBACKS:  Call callbacks with results, but don't
      call any callbacks when the reques is canceled.

   VAL_AS_INTERIM_CALLBACKS:  Call the callback function with interim
      results.  If this flag is not specified, the callback function
      will only be called when all validation results are ready.

5.1.2.  val_async_select_info

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_async_select_info(val_context_t *context,
                             fd_set *fds, int *max_fd,
                             struct timeval *timeout);

   The val_async_select_info() function examines all outstanding
   asynchronous requests for the given context and sets the appropriate

   file descriptors, timeout value and maximum file descriptor value in
   preparation for a call to select().

   The file descriptor for each socket awating a response MUST be set in
   the fds parameter.  The function MUST NOT initialize the fd_set, as
   the application may have already set its own file descriptors.

   The integer value pointed to by max_fd MUST be set to the highest
   file descriptor number of any pending asynchronous request, unless
   that value is less than the current vaule of max_fd.  In that case,
   the max_fd value MUST NOT be changed.

   The timeout structure MUST be set to the lowest timeout value of any
   pending asynchronous query timeout which is less than the current
   value in timeout.

   After the application call select, val_async_check_wait() (see
   Section 5.1.3) should be called with the fd_set and number of ready
   file descriptors returned by select.  Example code is provided in
   Appendix C.

5.1.3.  val_async_check_wait

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_async_check_wait(val_context_t *ctx, fd_set *fds,
                            int *nfds, struct timeval *timeout,
                            unsigned int flags);

   The val_async_check_wait() function handles timeouts or processes DNS
   responses to outstanding queries.  It may also call callbacks for
   completed requests.

   The function provides two modes of operation.  The first is for use
   with an application that has its own select() loop.  The applications
   sets its own file descriptors, calls val_async_select_info() to set
   file descriptors for pending queries and calls select().  The fds and
   nfds parameters from select are passed in to val_async_check_wait and
   the timeout value is ignored.  If the implementation processes
   responses for a file descriptor, the implementation SHOULD clear the
   appropriate file descriptor in fds and decrement nfds.

   In the second mode of operation, the fds and nfds parameters are set
   to NULL and a timeout value is specified.  The function will call
   val_async_select_info() and select() internally, and process any
   responses received before the timeout value expires.

   Example code is provided in Appendix C.

5.2.  Asynchronous Callbacks

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   typedef struct val_cb_params_s {
       val_status_t             val_status;
       char                    *name;
       int                      class_h;
       int                      type_h;
       int                      retval;
       struct val_result_chain *results;
       struct val_answer_chain *answers;
   } val_cb_params_t;

   typedef int (*val_async_event_cb)(val_async_status *as, int event,
                                     val_context_t *ctx, void *user_ctx,
                                     val_cb_params_t *callback_params);

   When an asynchronous request is submitted, a callback function and
   user context may be provided by the caller.  This callback function
   is called when validation results are available.  The user_ctx
   parameter MUST be the value given by the caller when the request was
   submitted.

   The callback params structure contains the orginal query parameters
   (name, class and type), the 'return value' for the operation,
   pointers to the result and answer chains, and the final validation
   status.  This structure will be released when the callback is
   completed.  The application can assume responsibility for any of the
   pointer values by copying them and setting the pointers in the
   callback param structure to NULL.  The application then becomes
   responsible for releasing the memory with val_free_result_chain (see
   Section 4.1) and/or val_free_answer_chain (see Section 3.4), as
   appropriate.

   The following event types are defined:


   VAL_AS_EVENT_COMPLETED:  The request completed.

   VAL_AS_EVENT_INTERIM:  The request is still being processed, but some
      interim results are available.

   VAL_AS_EVENT_CANCELED:  The request was canceled.  The val_status,
      results and answers members of the callback parameter structure
      are undefined.

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012




   Possible codes for val_status are listed in Section 8.1.  When
   evaluating the validity of a DNS response, applications SHOULD use
   the functions described in Section 8.2 instead of directly inspecting
   the DNSSEC validation status code returned in val_status.

   After the callback function has completed, the implementation SHOULD
   release all resources allocated for the request.

5.3.  Asynchronous Status

   An application which submits asynchronous requests needs a way to
   refer to each request for future operations.  This asynchronous
   status object is an implementation specific opaque object which an
   uniquely identifies a particular request.

   When an asynchronous request is submitted, the implementation MUST
   create an asynchronous status object to return to the caller.  The
   size of the object SHOULD be at least as large as the native pointer
   type.

5.3.1.  Operations on asynchronous status objects

   The API supports the following operations to manipulate asynchronous
   requests:

5.3.1.1.  val_async_cancel

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_async_cancel( val_context_t *context,
                         val_async_status *async_status,
                         unsigned int flags);

   This function will cancel an outstanding asynchronous request.  All
   resources used for the request SHOULD be released.

   The following flags may be set for the request.  The numerical values
   for the flags are implementation-specific.


   VAL_AS_CANCEL_NO_CALLBACKS:  Do not call completed or cancelled
      callbacks.

6.  DNSSEC Validator Context API

   DNSSEC validator policy can be used to influence the DNSSEC
   validation outcome.  Examples of DNSSEC validator policy include
   DNSSEC trust anchors for different zones and acceptable clock-skew
   values for checking inception and expiration times on signatures from
   different zones.

   DNSSEC validator policy is stored in the local system configuration
   (for example, the configuration file /etc/dnsval.conf) and could be
   configured differently for different applications and operating
   scenarios.  Policies are identified by simple text strings called
   labels, which MUST be unique within the system configuration.  As an
   example, "browser" could be used as the label that defines the DNSSEC
   validator policy for all web-browsers in a system.  The manner of
   supplying the validation policy label to an application is
   implementation-specific, but the label MAY also be supplied during
   application-startup through the environment variable,
   VAL_CONTEXT_LABEL.

   All DNSSEC validator policy definitions in the system configuration
   are implementation-specific.

6.1.  val_create_context, val_free_context

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_create_context( char *label,
                           val_context_t **newctx );

   void val_free_context( val_context_t *ctx );

   These function create and release, respectively, validator context
   objects.

   An application maintains a run-time handle to its validator policy
   through the validator context. val_create_context() creates a new
   DNSSEC validator context.  The label parameter identifies the DNSSEC
   validator policy to be used by the application for DNSSEC validation.
   The manner in which the label argument is used within the system
   configuration to identify specific validator policy settings is
   implementation-specific.  However, all libraries that implement this
   API MUST internally create a DNSSEC validator context with a (system-
   defined) default DNSSEC validator policy if label is NULL.

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012


   The val_create_context() function MUST return 0 on success, and an
   error code from Section 7 on failure.  Memory for the newly created
   DNSSEC validator context MUST be returned in the newctx field.  This
   memory MUST be released when applications invoke the
   val_free_context() function. newctx MUST be set to NULL if an error
   is encountered.

6.2.  val_context_setqflags

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_context_setqflags(val_context_t *context,
                             unsigned char action,
                             unsigned int flags);


   This function allows an application to set or reset default query
   flags for a given context.  This enables the application to alter the
   DNSSEC validator processing, while still having most of the granular
   default configuration specified in its configuration file.

   The application may specify one of the following action types, where
   their numeric values are implementation-specific.


   VAL_CTX_FLAG_SET:  Set the given flag as one of the default query
      flags for the context.

   VAL_CTX_FLAG_RESET:  Reset the given flag if it was set as one of the
      default query flags for the context.


7.  Function Return Codes and p_val_err()

   The return values from functions defined in the low-level API, the
   DNSSEC validator-context API, and the val_get_rrset() function MUST
   be from the list below.  Other high-level API functions mirror
   existing legacy DNS functions, so the return codes from these
   functions are identical to their predecessors.  The numerical values
   for the return codes listed below are implementation-specific.

   VAL_NO_ERROR:  The function call was successful.

   VAL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED:  The implementation did not support a particular
      feature.

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012



   VAL_RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE:  Some resource necessary for an operation
      (such as memory) was unavailable.

   VAL_BAD_ARGUMENT:  An unexpected value was passed as an argument to a
      function.

   VAL_INTERNAL_ERROR:  An internal error was encountered by the DNSSEC
      validator.

   VAL_CONF_PARSE_ERROR:  The DNSSEC validator configuration was
      improperly specified in the system configuration.

   VAL_CONF_NOT_FOUND:  The DNSSEC validator configuration could not be
      located in the system configuration.

   VAL_NO_POLICY:  The DNSSEC validator policy identifier being
      referenced was invalid.

   The p_val_err() function is used to convert an error code from the
   list above to a string representation.

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   const char *p_val_err(int err);

   The returned value from p_val_err() MAY be the string conversion for
   the corresponding error code identifier.  For example, the return
   value from p_val_err(VAL_NO_ERROR) MAY be "VAL_NO_ERROR".


8.  Evaluating Response Validity

   The result of DNSSEC validation for a resource record set, based on
   the individual status code of each element in an authentication
   chain, is returned in a variable of type val_status_t. val_status_t
   can contain one of the possible codes listed in Section 8.1.  The
   functions provided in Section 8.2 simplify the task of evaluating
   validity of an answer by wrapping around the different status codes
   possible for each type of answer.

8.1.  DNSSEC Validation Status Codes and p_val_status()

   A variable of type val_status_t MUST contain one of the following
   codes (the numerical values for these codes are implementation-
   specific):

   VAL_VALIDATED_ANSWER:  Returned if the combined DNSSEC validation
      status for a set of resource record set responses represents a
      validated state.

   VAL_TRUSTED_ANSWER:  Returned if the combined DNSSEC validation
      status for a set of resource record set responses represents a
      trusted (but non-validated) state.

   VAL_UNTRUSTED_ANSWER:  Returned if the combined DNSSEC validation
      status for a set of resource record set responses represents an
      untrusted state.

   VAL_SUCCESS:  The response for the given resource record set was
      successfully validated through the DNSSEC validation process.

   VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME:  The proof for denial of existence for a domain
      name validated successfully.

   VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE:  The proof for denial of existence for the
      resource record type for the given name was validated
      successfully.

   VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME_NOCHAIN:  The proof for non-existence of a
      domain name was considered valid through local DNSSEC validator
      configuration; the authentication chain(s) for the different
      components of the proof were not validated.

   VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE_NOCHAIN:  The proof for non-existence of the
      resource record type for the name queried was considered valid
      through local DNSSEC validator configuration; the authentication
      chain(s) for the different components of the proof were not
      validated.

   VAL_PINSECURE:  The record or some ancestor of the record in the
      authentication chain towards a DNSSEC trust anchor was known to be
      provably insecure and DNSSEC validator policy is configured to
      trust provably insecure answers.

   VAL_PINSECURE_UNTRUSTED:  The record or some ancestor of the record
      in the authentication chain towards a DNSSEC trust anchor was
      known to be provably insecure, but DNSSEC validator policy is
      configured to not trust provably insecure answers.

   VAL_BARE_RRSIG:  The response was for a query of type RRSIG.  RRSIGs
      contain the cryptographic signatures for other DNS data and cannot
      themselves be validated.

   VAL_IGNORE_VALIDATION:  DNSSEC validator policy was configured to
      ignore DNSSEC validation for the zone from where this data was
      received.

   VAL_UNTRUSTED_ZONE:  DNSSEC validator policy was configured to not
      trust any response from the zone that this data was received from.

   VAL_OOB_ANSWER:  The response was obtained using some out-of-band
      mechanism (for example, from a local configuration store such as
      /etc/hosts).

   VAL_BOGUS:  The response could not be validated due to signature
      verification failures or the inability to verify proofs of non-
      existence for one or more components in the authentication chain.

   VAL_DNS_ERROR:  Returned if a DNS error was encountered during the
      query resolution process.

   VAL_NOTRUST:  The authentication chain does not lead up to a
      configured DNSSEC trust anchor.

   The p_val_status() function is used to convert the DNSSEC validation
   status code stored in a variable of type val_status_t to a string
   representation.

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   const char *p_val_status(val_status_t status);

   The value returned MAY be the string conversion for the corresponding
   val_status_t identifier.  For example, the return value from
   p_val_status(VAL_SUCCESS) MAY be "VAL_SUCCESS".

8.2.  High-Level Routines for Evaluating Validity

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int val_istrusted(val_status_t status);

   int val_isvalidated(val_status_t status);

   int val_does_not_exist(val_status_t status);

   These functions return a boolean value indicating whether or not the
   given val_status_t object is trusted, validated or does not exist
   (respectively).




Krishnaswamy, et al.   Expires September 13, 2012              [Page 27]

   Most applications will only be interested in a single value that
   represents the validity of DNS data.  In some instances, an
   application may also need to distinguish between cases where the
   answer was cryptographically validated and cases where the answer was
   locally trusted.  The val_istrusted() and val_isvalidated() functions
   allow an application to evaluate, at a high level, the validity of a
   response without having to inspect the exact status code returned.

   The val_istrusted() function returns a single integer value
   representing the validity of information returned by the DNSSEC
   validator.  The return value MUST be greater than 0 if status is one
   of VAL_SUCCESS, VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME, VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE,
   VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME_NOCHAIN, VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE_NOCHAIN,
   VAL_PINSECURE, VAL_IGNORE_VALIDATION, VAL_TRUSTED_ANSWER, or
   VAL_VALIDATED_ANSWER and MUST be equal to 0 for other status codes.

   The val_isvalidated() function returns a single integer value that
   indicates if the answer cryptographically chains down from a
   configured DNSSEC trust anchor.  The return value MUST be greater
   than 0 if status is one of VAL_SUCCESS, VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME,
   VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE, or VAL_VALIDATED_ANSWER and MUST be equal to 0
   for other status codes.

   The val_does_not_exist() function allows an application to determine
   from the DNSSEC validation status value if the answer was provably
   non-existent.  In combination with the val_istrusted() and
   val_isvalidated() functions, it can give an indication about the
   manner in which validity was determined (cryptographically verified
   or trusted through local DNSSEC validator policy).  The return value
   from val_does_not_exist() MUST be greater than 0 if status is one of
   VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE, VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME,
   VAL_NONEXISTENT_NAME_NOCHAIN, or VAL_NONEXISTENT_TYPE_NOCHAIN and
   MUST be equal to 0 for other status codes.


9.  Notes On DNS Data Caching By Appplications

   Certain applications are known to cache DNS data for an application-
   specific length of time, independent of the TTL limits placed on the
   relevant DNS resource records.  Since DNS data is ephemeral by
   design, any caching performed independently by applications may
   conflict with zone publishers' needs to change such DNS records
   frequently.  An extension to this problem is the scenario where an
   application caches DNS data for an application-specific length of
   time during which period a zone operator may revoke a DNSSEC key,
   thus rendering that particular cached data as untrustworthy.

   It is recommended that applications MUST NOT cache DNS data in a



Krishnaswamy, et al.   Expires September 13, 2012              [Page 28]

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012


   manner that would violate the TTL limits placed on DNS records.
   Applications must, instead delegate the function of caching DNS data
   to a stub resolver or a local recursive resolver library, and to only
   use DNS API functions to request answers whenever necessary.  The
   stub or recursive resolver libraries should, in turn, determine from
   the resource record TTLs if a cached answer is available or if a
   fresh DNS query needs to be issued.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


11.  Security Considerations

   In certain cases DNS responses may be returned from the local system
   configuration (for example, from the /etc/hosts file on some
   systems).  The application cannot assume that these answers are
   valid, unless the application is certain that the local configuration
   store contains valid data.  If this information is modified during a
   DHCP lookup, for example, the client system should ensure that the
   DHCP server is a trusted source, and that the communication path
   between the DHCP server and the client system is secured.  If these
   conditions are not satisfied and if the application chooses to trust
   a locally available answer, an attacker may be able to poison the
   system configuration and cause an application to use invalid answers.
   If applications are to treat out-of-band answers as trusted, this
   choice SHOULD be made explicit through a validator policy
   configuration knob.

   Applications can similarly choose to trust data from provably
   insecure zones.  Not performing DNSSEC validation for a zone that has
   DNSSEC intentionally turned off is no worse than the current
   situation of DNSSEC-unaware applications not being able to detect the
   integrity of DNS data for such zones.

   The DNS search path may affect the result of DNSSEC validation,
   especially in the current Internet environment where not all DNS name
   servers are expected to be DNSSEC-aware.  If the name server pointed
   to by the system configuration is not DNSSEC-aware (i.e. it does not
   return DNSSEC records), DNSSEC validation will not work as expected,
   unless the validator has certain fallback mechanims in place to try
   and route around such broken behavior.

   The DNSSEC validator configuration information needs to be protected
   so that it cannot be overwritten by unauthorized users or processes.
   The system administrator must ensure that the list of DNSSEC trust



Krishnaswamy, et al.   Expires September 13, 2012              [Page 29]

Internet-Draft            DNSSEC Validator API                March 2012


   anchors is kept accurate and up-to-date.  If the DNSSEC trust anchors
   are outdated (in the event of key-rollovers), the DNSSEC validator
   may either falsely mark zones as bogus or may operate with the false
   belief of having validated a response when the response should really
   have been flagged as bogus.  Any subversion of the DNSSEC policy
   configuration (including definition of new trust anchors) can
   similarly completely undermine the value provided by DNSSEC.

Appendix A.  Zone-Specific Validator Policy Settings

   Zone-specific validator policy settings may have the following
   structure.

   <label> <attribute> <additional-data>;

   Sample values for <attribute> are "trust-anchor", "zone-security-
   expectation", "provably-insecure-status", "clock-skew".  The value
   for <additional-data> would depend on the type of attribute
   specified.

   o  For the "trust-anchor" attribute additional-data could be a
      sequence of ordered pairs, each consisting of the zone name and a
      string containing the resource record data for the trust anchor's
      DNSKEY or DS record.  An example is given below.

       browser trust-anchor
         .   DS  19036  8  2  \

   o  For the "zone-security-expectation" attribute additional-data
      could be a sequence of <domain name,value> tuples representing the
      security expectation for names in that domain, where value could
      be one of the following:

      ignore:  Ignore DNSSEC validation for names under this domain.
      validate:  Perform DNSSEC validation of answers received for names
         under this domain.
      untrusted:  Reject all answers received for names under this
         domain.

      This zone-security-expectation DNSSEC validator policy construct
      makes it possible to define various islands of trust for DNSSEC-
      enabled zones and to ignore or trust data from selected zones.
      The default zone security expectation for a domain should be
      "validate".  In the following example, for DNSSEC validator
      contexts created with a DNSSEC validator policy label of
      "browser", DNSSEC validation would only be performed for names
      under the example.com domain; names under the somebogusdomain.org
      domain would always considered to be untrusted and DNSSEC
      validation for all other domain names would be ignored.

       browser zone-security-expectation
           example.com  validate
           somebogusdomain.org untrusted
           . ignore
           ;

   o  For the "provably-insecure-status" attribute additional-data could
      be a sequence of <domain name,value> tuples representing the
      validity of the provably insecure condition, where value could be
      one of the following:

      trusted:  Treat the provably insecure condition as valid.
      untrusted:  Treat the provably insecure condition as invalid.

      The default value for the provably insecure status for a domain
      should be "trusted".  In the following example, for DNSSEC
      validator contexts created with the default label, the provably
      insecure condition would be treated as trustworthy for all domains
      except the net domain, where this condition would be treated as
      invalid.

       : provably-insecure-status
           . trusted
           net untrusted
           ;

   o  For the "clock-skew" attribute additional-data could be a sequence
      of the domain name and the number of seconds of clock-skew
      acceptable for signatures on names in that domain.  A clock skew
      value of -1 could have the effect of turning off inception and
      expiration time checks on signatures from that domain.  The
      default clock skew should be 0.  In the following example, for
      DNSSEC validator contexts created with the "mta" label, signature
      inception and expiration checks would be disabled for all names
      under the example.com domain.

       mta clock-skew
           example.com -1
           ;


Appendix B.  Global Validator Policy

   Global policy options guide validator behavior across multiple zones.
   Global policy options for the DNSSEC validator could be defined under
   a separate section within the validator system configuration.  Some
   of the possible configuration knobs for global validator policy
   include the following.

   o  trust-oob-answers <yes/no>: policy on whether or not the validator
      should trust answers received out-of-band.
   o  edns0-size <default-edns0-size>: the default EDNS0 size to be
      advertized in queries sent out by the validator.


Appendix C.  Asynchronous API Example Code

   The general flow for asynchronous request processing can be described
   with the following pseudo-code:

   #include <validator/validator.h>

   int done = 0;

   int my_callback(val_async_status *async_status, int event,
                   val_context_t *ctx, void *user_ctx,
                   val_cb_params_t *cbp) {
      if (event == VAL_AS_EVENT_CANCELED) {
         fprint("canceled: %s", (char*)user_ctx);
         return;
      }

      fprintf("final status for %s: %d\n", (char*)user_ctx,
              val_async_status(async_status));

      done = 1;
      return 0;
   }

   main() {
      val_async_status *async_status;
      struct timeval    tv;
      fd_set            fds;
      int               nfds, ready;
      val_context      *ctx = NULL;
      char             *domain = "www.example.com";

      /* submit request */
      rc = val_async_submit(ctx, domain, ns_c_in, ns_t_a, 0,
                            my_callback, (void*)domain, &async_status);
      while (!done) {
         tv.usec = 0;
         tv.sec = 10;         /* maximum timeout 10 sec */

   #ifdef NO_APPLICATION_FDS

         val_async_check_wait(ctx, NULL, NULL, &tv, 0);

   #else /* HAVE_OUR_OWN_FDS_TO_WATCH */

         FD_ZERO(&fds);       /* clear fd_set */
         nfds = 0;            /* no FDs yet */

         /* set FDs for pending requests. application should also set
          * its own FDs, if any, before calling select */
         val_async_select_info(&ctx, &fds, &numfds, &tv);
         ready = select(numfds+1, &fds, NULL, NULL, &tv);
         if ( ready < 0 ) {
            break; /* or continue... */
         } else if ( ready == 0 ) {
            /* application timeout processing */
         } else {
            /* application FD processing */
         }
         /* handle async FDs/timeouts */
         val_async_check(&ctx, &fds, &numfds, flags);

   #endif
      }
   }
