        Terminology for Benchmarking LDP Data Plane Convergence
                draft-parise-ldp-convergence-term-00.txt

Abstract

   This document defines new terms for benchmarking of LDP convergence.
   These terms are to be used in future methodology documents for
   benchmarking LDP Convergence.  Existing BMWG terminology documents
   such as IGP Convergence Benchmarking [RFC 6412] provide useful terms
   for LDP Convergence benchmarking.  These terms are discussed in this
   document.  Applicable terminology for MPLS and LDP defined in MPLS WG
   RFCs [RFC 3031] and [RFC 5036] are also discussed.

Internet-Draft        LDP Benchmarking Terminology             July 2013


1.  Introduction

   This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking LDP
   Convergence.  An accompanying document will describe the methodology
   for doing the benchmarking.  The main motivation for doing this work
   is the increased focus on lowering convergence time for LDP as an
   alternative to other solutions such as MPLS Fast Reroute (i.e.
   protection techniques using RSVP-TE extensions).

   The purpose of this document is to find existing terminology as well
   as define new terminology when needed terms are not available.  The
   terminology will support the methodology that will be based on black-
   box testing of the LDP dataplane.  The approach is very similar to
   the one found in [RFC 6412] and [RFC 6413].

3.18.  Label Merging LSR

   Definition:

      A LSR which is capable of sending multiple packets out of the same
      outgoing interface with the same label even though it receives
      these packets from different incoming interfaces and may also
      receive them with the same lane

   Discussion:

      With label merging the LSR need to send a single label per FEC and
      also on the receiving end the number of incoming labels per FEC is
      never larger than the number of label distribution adjacencies

   Measurement Units:

      N/A

   Issues:

      There maybe be scenarios where a Merging LSR is capable of merging
      only a subset of incoming labels into a single outgoing label

3.19.  Non-merging LSR

   Definition:

      A LSR which forwards packets with multiple outgoing labels when it
      receives packets from the same FEC with different incoming labels

   Discussion:

      Without label merging the number of outgoing labels per FEC could
      be as large as the number of nodes in the network

   Measurement Units:

      N/A

   Issues:

      None

3.20.  LDPv6

   Definition:

      This term implies forwarding of IPv6 packets as detailed in [RFC
      5036]

   Discussion:

      None

   Measurement Units:

      N/A

   Issues:

      The current specification [RFC 5036] has certain gaps as detailed
      in [LDPv6].  Once its standardized we will extend the scope to
      cover those details.

4.  Factors impacting Convergence

4.1.  Interaction with Other Protocols

   LDP convergence must include the affect of interaction with IGPs.
   All test reports must include the IGPs provisioned in the test and
   their associated parameters

4.2.  Timers

   LDP convergence is impacted by the Hold and Keepalive Timers.  Test
   reports must include all the relevant timer values

4.3.  TCP Parameters

   As LDP uses TCP for sessions, all relevant TCP session parameters
   must be reported


5.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.
