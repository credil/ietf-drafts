Abstract

   This document provides an information model for the optical
   impairment characteristics of optical network elements for use in
   GMPLS/PCE control plane protocols and mechanisms. This information
   model supports Impairment Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment
   (IA-RWA) in optical networks in which path computation and optical
   path validation are essential components. This is not a general
   network management information model.

   This model is based on ITU-T defined optical network element
   characteristics as given in ITU-T recommendation G.680 and related
   specifications. This model is intentionally compatible with a
   previous impairment free optical information model used in optical
   path computations and wavelength assignment.

1. Introduction

   Impairments in optical networks can be accounted for in a number of
   ways as discussed in reference [Imp-Frame]. This document provides
   an information model for path validation in optical networks
   utilizing approximate computations. The definitions, characteristics
   and usage of the optical parameters that form this model are based
   on ITU-T recommendation G.680 [G.680]. This impairment related model
   is intentionally compatible with the impairment free model of
   reference [RWA-Info]. Although this document focuses on the optical
   impairment parameters from a control plane point of view, Appendix B
   provides a list of optical parameter definitions from ITU-T G.680
   and related documents.

   This document only covers the links and network elements. The end
   system models (i.e., transmitter and receiver models based on the
   interfaces defined in G.698.1 and G.698.2) are subject to further
   study.

1.1. Revision History

   From 04 to 05: Updated references, general grammar and usage
   editing, added information and reference on environmental factors
   related to time varying parameters.

2. Properties of an Impairment Information Model

   An information model may have several attributes or properties that
   need to be defined for each optical parameter made available to the
   control plane. The properties will help to determine how the control
   plane can deal with it depending on architectural options chosen
   within the overall impairment framework [Imp-Frame]. In some case
   properties value will help to indentify the level of approximation
   supported by the IV process.

  o  Time Dependency. This will identify how the impairment may vary
     with time. There could be cases where there is no time dependency,
     while in other cases there may be need of  impairment re-
     evaluation after a certain time. In some cases a level of
     approximation will consider an impairment that has time dependency
     as constant. In this category,  variations in impairments due to
     environmental factors such as those discussed in [G.sup47] are
     considered.

  o  Wavelength Dependency. This property will identify if an
     impairment value can be considered as constant over all the
     wavelength spectrum of interest or if it has different values.
     Also in this case a detailed impairment evaluation might lead to
     consider the exact value while an approximation IV might take a
     constant value for all wavelengths.

  o  Linearity. As impairments are representation of physical effects
     there are some that have a linear behavior while other are non
     linear. Linear impairments are in general easy to consider while a
     non linear will require the knowledge of the full path to be
     evaluated. An approximation level could only consider linear
     effects or approximate non-linear impairments in linear ones.

  o  Multi-Channel. There are cases where a channel's impairments take
     different values depending on the aside wavelengths already in
     place. In this case a dependency among different LSP is
     introduced. An approximation level can neglect or not the effects
     on neighbor LSPs.

  o  Value range. An impairment that has to be considered by a
     computational element needs a representation in bits. Different
     impairment types may require representations as  integers,   real
     numbers, or as a fixed set of values. This information is
     important in term of protocol definition and level of
     approximation introduced by the number representation.



3. Optical Impairment Information Model

   The definitions of optical impairment parameters of network elements
   and examples of their use can be found in [G.680] and related
   documents (also see Appendix B). From an information modeling and
   control plane perspective, one basic aspect of a given parameter is
   the scope of its applicability within a network element. In
   particular we need to know which parameters will (a) apply to the
   network element as a whole, (b) can vary on a per port basis for a
   network element, and (c) can vary based on ingress to egress port
   pairs. A second orthogonal aspect of impairment parameters is
   whether a parameter exhibits a strong frequency variation over the
   optical frequencies supported by the subnetwork.

3.1. Network Element Wide Parameters

   Based on the definitions in [G.680] and related documents the
   following parameters apply to the network element as a whole. At
   most one of these parameters is required per network element.

   1. Channel frequency range (GHz, Max, Min)

   2. Channel insertion loss deviation (dB, Max)

   3. Ripple (dB, Max)

   4. Channel chromatic dispersion (ps/nm, Max, Min)

   5. Differential group delay (ps, Max)

   6. Polarization dependent loss (dB, Max)

   7. Reflectance (passive component) (dB, Max)

   8. Reconfigure time/Switching time (ms, Max, Min)

   9. Channel uniformity (dB, Max)

   10.   Channel addition/removal (steady-state) gain response (dB,
      Max, Min)

   11.   Transient duration (ms, Max)

   12.   Transient gain increase (dB, Max)

   13.   Transient gain reduction (dB, Max)

   14.   Multichannel gain-change difference (inter-channel gain-change
      difference) (dB, Max)

   15.   Multichannel gain tilt (inter-channel gain-change ratio)(dB,
      Max)

3.2. Per Port Parameters

   The following optical parameters may exhibit per port dependence,
   hence may be specified at most once for each port of the network
   element.

   1. Total input power range (dBm, Max, Min)

   2. Channel input power range (dBm, Max, Min)

   3. Channel output power range (dBm, Max, Min)

   4. Input reflectance (dB, Max) (with amplifiers)

   5. Output reflectance (dB, Max) (with amplifiers)

   6. Maximum reflectance tolerable at input (dB, Min)

   7. Maximum reflectance tolerable at output (dB, Min)

   8. Maximum total output power (dBm, Max)

3.3. Port to Port Parameters

   The following optical parameters may exhibit a port-to-port
   dependence and hence may be specified at most once for each
   ingress/egress port pair of the network element.

   1. Insertion loss (dB, Max, Min)

   2. Isolation, adjacent channel (dB, Min)

Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model             June 2012


   3. Isolation, non-adjacent channel (dB, Min)

   4. Channel extinction (dB, Min)

   5. Channel signal-spontaneous noise figure (dB, Max)

   6. Channel gain (dB, Max, Min)

3.4. Frequency Dependent Parameters

   Many of the previously mentioned parameters can exhibit significant
   frequency dependence over the range of wavelength supported by a
   subnetwork. In reference [G.680] parameters denoted as related to
   "channel" could exhibit significant frequency variation that would
   need to be encoded efficiently. These parameters may include:

   1. Channel insertion loss deviation (dB, Max)

   2. Channel chromatic dispersion (ps/nm, Max, Min)

   3. Channel uniformity (dB, Max)

   4. Insertion loss (dB, Max, Min)

   5. Channel extinction (dB, Min)

   6. Channel signal-spontaneous noise figure (dB, Max)

   7. Channel gain (dB, Max, Min)

   Finalization of this list is TBD and will need liaison with ITU-T.



4. Encoding Considerations

   The units for the various parameters include GHz, dB, dBm, ms, ps,
   and ps/nm. These are typically expressed as floating point numbers.
   Due to the measurement limitations inherent in these parameters
   single precision floating point, e.g., 32 bit IEEE floating point,
   numbers should be sufficient. For this purpose the guideline is
   provided by [G.697] Appendix V that lists parameters and defines a
   suitable encoding. For realistic optical network elements per port
   and port-to-port parameters typically only assume a few values. For
   example, the channel gain of a ROADM is usually specified in terms
   of input to drop, add to output, and input to output. This implies
   that many port and port-to-port parameters could be efficiently

   specified, stored and transported by making use of the Link Set Sub-
   TLV and Connectivity Matrix Sub-TLV of reference [Encode].

   For parameters that vary with frequency we have the following
   options:

   1. Explicit parameter list with associated frequencies: Here we
      would give the parameter and frequencies it applies to.  We would
      need as many of these parameter/frequency pairs as necessary to
      cover all the frequencies and parameters. This could get large
      for a high channel count system with strong frequency
      dependencies in some parameters.

   2. Provide "standardized" general interpolation formulas and
      parameters for use over an entire frequency range or sub-range.

   3. Use parameter specific interpolation formulas based on ITU-T and
      other standards. For example in reference [G.650.1] Annex A
      equations and fitting coefficients are given for chromatic
      dispersion interpolation. Such formulas may be valid over an
      entire frequency range or a sub-range.

5. Usage of Parameters in Optical Path Validation

   Given an optical path and the optical characteristics of each
   network element along the path we can then use these characteristics
   to validate the path. We envision that these parameters will be made
   available via some mechanism to the entity which validates optical
   paths. Refer to [Imp-Frame] for architectural options in which
   impairment validation for an optical path is defined.

   Sections 9 and 10 of G.680 give techniques and formulas for use in
   calculating the impact of a cascade of network elements such as
   occurs along an optical signal path. These range from relatively
   simple bounds on the sum of uncompensated chromatic dispersion
   (residual dispersion) to more elaborate formulas for overall optical
   signal to noise ration (OSNR) computations based on multiple
   parameters including noise factor.

   To further aid understanding and use of these optical parameters
   Appendix I of [G.680] provides example parameter values for
   different network element types and appendix II provides examples of
   computations involving the cascades of network elements along a
   path.

5.2. Distributed Computation

   This section lists the parameters required for a distributed

   are reported in the appendix. This section here lists only the
   parameters that need to be exchanged among nodes.

   o  Chromatic Dispersion

6. Security Considerations

   This document defines an information model for impairments in
   optical networks. If such a model is put into use within a network
   it will by its nature contain details of the physical
   characteristics of an optical network. Such information would need
   to be protected from intentional or unintentional disclosure.

7. IANA Considerations

   This draft does not currently require any consideration from IANA.

8. Conclusions

   The state of standardization of optical device characteristics has
   matured from when initial IETF work concerning optical impairments
   was investigated in [RFC4054]. Relatively recent ITU-T
   recommendations provide a standardized based of optical
   characteristic definitions and parameters that control plane
   technologies such as GMPLS and PCE can make use of in performing
   optical path validation. The enclosed information model shows how
   readily such ITU-T optical work can be utilized within the control
   plane.

APPENDIX A: Distributed Impairment Accumulation Model

   In reference [Imp-Frame] an alternative impairment aware RWA control
   plane based on distributed impairment validation was discussed. In
   such a scheme the preceding impairment information model would not
   be distributed via a link state IGP, instead a set of impairment
   parameters would be computed along the proposed path and a final
   decision on whether the path is viable would be made based on these
   accumulated impairment parameters. It should be noted that these
   accumulated impairment parameters are estimated at each node along
   the path and not measured.

   When signaling a path we think of the "nodes" as being the switching
   nodes along the path. In the case of optical impairments the
   properties of the links (WDM line systems) are just as important as
   the properties of the nodes. In the following we will assume that
   the switching nodes (GMPLS nodes) will act on behalf of all the line
   systems corresponding to their egress ports. In particular this
   implies that some how these nodes will obtain the line system
   impairment information.

   In Figure 1 we show an example system from appendix II of [G.680].
   This diagram shows the DWDM line systems including amplifiers, BA =
   booster amplifier, LA = line amplifier. For distributed impairment
   validation we would group the line systems with their preceding
   nodes as shown for computational purposes.


   Section 9 of ITU-T G.680 [G.680] shows how various impairment
   parameters accumulate and this suggests that the following
   parameters or subset thereof could be used in distributed impairment
   estimation:

   o  Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR)

   o  Residual Dispersion (chromatic)

   o  Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD)

   o  Polarization Dependent Loss (PDL)

   o  Ripple

   o  Channel Uniformity

   For each of the above the units and accumulation procedure needs to
   be defined. In the following we suggest units and procedures for the
   above for which computation of cascaded elements are suitably
   defined in [G.680]. Note: ONE = Optical Network Element.

A.1. Distributed Computation of OSNR

   Section 9.1 of ITU-T G.680 gives several equivalent formulas for the
   estimation of OSNR. For distributed impairment validation the
   following formula from [G.680] is convenient:

   OSNR_out = -10*log(Term1 + Term2)

   Where

   Term1 = 10^-(ONSR_in/10), and

   Term2 = 10^-((P_in-NF-10*log(h*v*vr))/10)

   and we have the following additional definitions:

   OSNR_out is the output optical signal to noise ratio in dB of the
   ONE

   OSNR_in is the input optical signal to noise ratio in dB of the ONE

   P_in is the channel power (dBm) at the input port of the ONE

   NF is the noise figure (dB) of the relevant path through the ONE

   h is Planck's constant (in mJ*s to be consistent with P_in in dBm)

   v is the optical frequency in Hz

   vr is the reference bandwidth in Hz (usually the frequency
   equivalent of 0.1nm)



Lee & Bernstein       Expires December 13, 2012               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model             June 2012


   From the previous formula, a distributed computation of OSNR
   requires knowing the OSNR_in and the P_in based on computations from
   the previous node along the path. The noise figure, F, is something
   that the current node performing the computation would know along
   with the frequency, v, and the reference bandwidth vr (TBD: confirm
   with ITU-T).

   The control plane will need to distribute the following information
   from node to node along the path:

   o  OSNR_in (this is the accumulated OSNR along the path)(dB)

   o  P_in (this is the estimated power into the next node)(dBm)

   The input power would be calculated by the previous node by taking
   into account gain and attenuation on the link between the nodes.

A.2. Distributed Computation of Residual Dispersion

   The residual dispersion for a path is required to be bounded, in
   particular from [G.680] equation 9-4:

   Min RD < Residual Dispersion < Max RD

   Where Min RD and Max RD are the minimum and maximum tolerable
   residual dispersion for a particular transmitter/receiver
   combination.

   The residual dispersion for a cascade of network elements can be
   computed by [G.680] equation 9-5:

   Residual dispersion = sum(fiber dispersion) + sum(DCM dispersion)
                         + sum(ONE dispersion)


   Where DCM dispersion is from Dispersion Compensation Modules (DCM),
   and ONE dispersion is due to optical network elements.

   Although the residual dispersion formula is a relatively simple
   linear formula [G.680] indicates two possible methods for its
   evaluation (a) Worst-case upper and lower bounds, or (b)Statistical
   approach. In case (a) two parameters would need to be accumulated
   along the path a worst case upper and lower bound. In case (b) some
   type of statistical information would be needed in [G.680] mean and
   standard deviation are used under a Gaussian assumption.

A.3. Distributed Computation of PMD

   The accumulated impact of line system and ONE polarization mode
   dispersion can be estimated via the formula [G.680] equation (9-6):

   DGDmax_link = {DGDmaxf^2 + S^2*sum_i(PMDc_i^2)}^(1/2)

   where

      DGDmax_link    is the max link DGD (ps)

      DGDmxf      is the max concatenated optical fiber cable DGD (ps)

      S           is the Maxwell adjustment factor(Table 9-2 of
   [G.680])

      PMDc_i      is the PMD value for the ith component (ps)

   Under a distributed computation approach the above could be computed
   by keeping track of DGDmaxf and the running sum of PMDc_i^2. The
   Maxwell adjustment factor and final square root can be applied at
   the final node in the path. [Question for Q6: does DGDMaxf^2 need to
   be accumulated over the different link segments?]

APPENDIX B: Optical Parameters

   The following provides an annotated list of optical characteristics
   from ITU-T recommendation G.680 [G.680] for use in optical path
   impairment computations. For each parameter we specify the units to
   be used, whether minimum or maximum values are used, and whether the
   parameters applies to the optical network element as a whole, on a
   per port basis or on a port-to-port pair basis.

   Not all these parameters will apply to all devices. The main
   differentiation in G.680 comes from those network elements that
   include or do not include optical amplifiers.

B.1. Parameters for NEs without optical amplifiers

   Channel frequency range (GHz, Max, Min): [G.671] The frequency range
   within which a DWDM device is required to operate with a specified
   performance. For a particular nominal channel central frequency,
   fnomi, this frequency range is from fimin = (fnomi - dfmax) to fimax
   = (fnomi + dfmax), where dfmax is the maximum channel central
   frequency deviation. Nominal channel central frequency and maximum
   channel central frequency deviation are defined in ITU-T Rec. G.692.

   Insertion loss (dB, Port-Port, Max, Min):[G.671] It is the reduction
   in optical power between an input and output port of a WDM device in
   decibels (dB).

   Channel insertion loss deviation (dB, Max):[G.671] This is the
   maximum variation of insertion loss at any frequency within the
   channel frequency range (DWDM devices) or channel wavelength range
   (CWDM and WWDM devices).

   Ripple (dB, Max): [G.671] For WDM devices and tuneable filters, the
   peak-to-peak difference in insertion loss within a channel frequency
   (or wavelength) range.

   Channel chromatic dispersion (ps/nm, Max, Min): [G.650.1] Change of
   the group delay of a light pulse for a unit fibre length caused by a
   unit wavelength change.

   Differential group delay (ps, Max): [G.671] Polarization Mode
   Dispersion (PMD) is usually described in terms of a Differential
   Group Delay (DGD), which is the time difference between the
   principal States of Polarization (SOPs) of an optical signal at a
   particular wavelength and time.

   Polarization dependent loss (dB, Max): [G.671] Maximum variation of
   insertion loss due to a variation of the state of polarization (SOP)
   over all SOPs.

   Reflectance (dB, Max): [G.671] The ratio of reflected power Pr to
   incident power, Pi at a given port of a passive component, for given
   conditions of spectral composition, polarization and geometrical
   distribution.

   Isolation, adjacent channel (dB, Min, Port-Port): [G.671] The
   adjacent channel isolation (of a WDM device) is defined to be equal
   to the unidirectional (far-end) isolation of that device with the
   restriction that x, the isolation wavelength number, is restricted
   to the channels immediately adjacent to the (channel) wavelength
   number associated with port o.

   Isolation, non-adjacent channel (dB, Min, Port-Port): [G.671] The
   non-adjacent channel isolation (of a WDM device) is defined to be
   equal to the unidirectional (far-end) isolation of that device with
   the restriction that x, the isolation wavelength number, is
   restricted to each of the channels not immediately adjacent to the
   (channel) wavelength number associated with port o.

   Note: [G.671] In a WDM device able to separate k wavelengths (w1,
   w2, ... , wk) radiation coming from one input port into k output
   ports, each one nominally passing radiation at one specific
   wavelength only. The unidirectional (far-end) isolation is a measure
   of the part of the optical power at each wavelength exiting from the
   port at wavelengths different from the nominal wavelength relative
   to the power at the nominal wavelength.

   Channel extinction (dB, Min, Port-Port): [G.671] Within the
   operating wavelength range, the difference (in dB) between the
   maximum insertion loss for the non-extinguished (non-blocked)
   channels and the minimum insertion loss for the extinguished
   (blocked) channels.

   Reconfigure time (ms, Max, Min): [G.680] The reconfigure time (of an
   ROADM) is the elapsed time measured from the earliest point that the
   actuation energy is applied to reconfigure the ONE to the time when
   the channel insertion loss for all wanted channels has settled to
   within 0.5 dB of its final steady state value and all other
   parameters of the device (e.g., isolation and channel extinction)are
   within the allowed limits.

   Switching time (for PXC) (ms, Max, Min): [G.671] The elapsed time it
   takes the switch to turn path io on or off from a particular initial

   removed.

   Channel uniformity (dB, Max): [G.671] The difference (in dB) between
   the powers of the channel with the most power (in dBm) and the
   channel with the least power (in dBm). This applies to a

   Maximum reflectance tolerable at input (dB, Min, Port): [G.661] The
   maximum fraction of power, expressed in dB, exiting the optical
   input port of the OA which, when reflected back into the OA, allows
   the device to still meet its specifications.

   Maximum reflectance tolerable at output (dB, Min, Port): [G.661] The
   maximum fraction of power, expressed in dB, exiting the optical
   output port of the OA which, when reflected back into the OA, allows
