      PCEP Extensions for MPLS-TE LSP protection with stateful PCE
              draft-crabbe-pce-stateful-pce-protection-00

Abstract

   Stateful PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] can apply global concurrent
   optimizations to optimize LSP placement.  In a deployment where a PCE
   is used to compute all the paths, it may be beneficial for the
   protection paths to also be computed by the PCE.  This document
   defines extensions needed for the setup and management of MPLS-TE
   protection paths by the PCE.

Internet-Draft         Stateful PCE LSP protection          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol PCEP.  PCEP
   defines the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
   a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE, enabling
   computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.

   Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of paths such as MPLS
   TE LSPs between and across PCEP sessions in compliance with
   [RFC4657].  It includes mechanisms to effect LSP state
   synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of control of LSPs
   to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of path computations
   within and across PCEP sessions and focuses on a model where LSPs are
   configured on the PCC and control over them is delegated to the PCE.

   Stateful PCE can apply global concurrent optimizations to optimize
   LSP placement.  In a deployment where a PCE is used to compute all
   the paths, it may be beneficial for the protection paths to also be
   controlled through the PCE.  This document defines extensions needed
   for the setup and management of protection paths by the PCE.

   Benefits of controlling the protection paths include: better control
   over traffic after a failure and more deterministic path computation
   (paths not affected by overload after a failure).


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]: Stateful PCE, Delegation, Delegation
   Timeout Interval, LSP State Report, LSP Update Request.

   The message formats in this document are specified using Routing
   Backus-Naur Format (RBNF) encoding as specified in [RFC5511].


3.  Architectural Overview

3.1.  Path Protection Overview

   Path protection refers to switching to a new path on failure.
   Several cases exist:




Crabbe, et al.           Expires April 15, 2013                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Stateful PCE LSP protection          October 2012


   (1)  MPLS-TE Global Default Restoration - protection paths are
        computed dynamically by the LSR after the failure.  This can be
        supported without any PCEP protocol changes by specifying a
        secondary path with an ERO of just the end points of the LSP.
        Once reestablished, the path is communicated to the PCE via the
        LSP State Report message.

   (2)  MPLS-TE Global Path Protection - protection paths are fully
        specified ahead of the failure.  The base Stateful PCE
        specification [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] supports sending
        multiple fully-specified paths in the PCUpd requests.There are 2
        further sub-cases:

        (a)  Protection paths are pre-signaled ahead of the failure
             (standby paths).

        (b)  Protection paths are set up after the failure.

   The protection path setup regimen (standby or not) is specified in
   the path using a new per-path flag in the LSPA object, the S
   (standby) flag (see section Section 4.1).  Paths for which the S flag
   is set MUST have a name associated with them, specified using the
   SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV in the LSPA object.

   Because multiple secondary standby paths are possible, there is also
   a need for the PCE to be able to specify the relative priorities
   between the paths (which one to take if there are 3 available).  This
   is done through a weight assigned to each path.  See details in
   Section 4.2.

   Reversion from protection paths to the primary path when possible
   will be controlled by the PCE, by sending a new LSP Update Request.
   If the primary can be successfully signaled and the secondary does
   not have the S flag set, then the secondary MUST be torn down.  Thus,
   there is no need to signal the desire for revertive behavior.

3.2.  Local Protection Overview

   Local protection refers to the ability to locally route around
   failure of an LSP.  Two types of local protection are possible:

   (1)  1:1 protection - the protection path protects a single LSP.

   (2)  1:N protection - the protection path protects multiple LSPs
        traversing the protected resource.

   It is assumed that the PCE knows what resources require protection
   through mechanisms outside the scope of this document.  In a PCE-



Crabbe, et al.           Expires April 15, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Stateful PCE LSP protection          October 2012


   controlled deployment, support of 1:1 protection has limited
   applicability, and can be achieved as a degenerate case of 1:N
   protection.  For this reason, local protection will be disccussed
   only for the 1:N case.

   Local protection requires the setup of a bypass at the PLR.  This
   bypass can be locally initiated and delegated, or PCE-initiated.  In
   either case, the PLR must maintain a PCEP session to the PCE.  A
   bypass identifier (the name of the bypass) is required for
   disambiguation as multiple bypasses are possible at the PLR.  Mapping
   of LSPs to bypass is done through a new TLV, the LOCALLY-PROTECTED-
   LSPS TLV in the LSP Update message from PCE to PLR.  See section
   Section 4.4.  When an LSP requiring protection is set up through the
   PLR, the PLR checks if it has a mapping to a bypass and only provides
   protection if such a mapping exists.  The status of bypasses and what
   LSPs are protected by them is communicated to the PCE via LSP Status
   Report messages.


4.  Extensions for the LSPA object

4.1.  The Standby flag in the LSPA object

   The LSPA object is defined in [RFC5440] and replicated below for easy
   reference.  This document defines a new flag, the S flag in the flags
   field of the LSPA object.

   The L flag is defined in [RFC5440].

   If set to 1, the S Flag indicates this is a standby path.

   If the S flag is set, the LSPA object MUST also carry the SYMBOLIC-
   PATH-NAME TLV as one of the optional TLVs.  Failure to include the
   mandatory SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV when the S flag is set MUST trigger
   PCErr of type 6 (Mandatory Object missing) and value TBD (SYMBOLIC-
   PATH-NAME TLV missing for standby LSP).

4.2.  The Weight TLV

   This TLV will be discussed in a future version of tihs document.

4.3.  The Bypass TLV

   The facility backup method creates a bypass tunnel to protect a
   potential failure point.  The bypass tunnel protects a set of LSPs
   with similar backup constraints {RFC4090].

   A PCC can delegate a bypass tunnel to PCE control or a PCE can
   provision the bypass tunnel via a PCC.  The procedures for bypass
   instantiation rely on the extensions defined in
   [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] and will be detailed in a future
   version of this document.

   The Bypass TLV carries information about the bypass tunnel.  It is
   included in the LSPA Object in LSP State Report and LSP Update
   Request messages.

   The format of the Bypass TLV is shown in the following figure:


        0                   1                   2                   3

                        Figure 2: Bypass TLV format

   The type of the TLV is [TBD] and it has a fixed length of 8 octets.
   The value contains the following fields:

   Flags

      N (Node Protection - 1 bit):  The N Flag indicates whether the
         Bypass is used for node-protection.  If the N flag is set to 1,
         the Bypass is used for node-protection.  If the N flag is 0,
         the Bypass is used for link-protection.

      I (Local Protection In Use - 1 bit):  The I Flag indicates that
         local repair mechanism is in use.

   Bypass IPv4 address:  For link protection, the Bypass IPv4 Address is
      the nexthop address of the protected link in the paths of the
      protected LSPs.  For node protection, the Bypass IPv4 Address is
      the node addresses of the protected node.

   If the Bypass TLV is included, then the LSPA object MUST also carry
   the SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV as one of the optional TLVs.  Failure to
   include the mandatory SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV MUST trigger PCErr of
   type 6 (Mandatory Object missing) and value TBD (SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME
   TLV missing for bypass LSP)

4.4.  The LOCALLY-PROTECTED-LSPS TLV

   The LOCALLY-PROTECTED-LSPS TLV in the LSPA Object contains a list of
   LSPs protected by the bypass tunnel.

   The format of the Bypass TLV is shown in the following figure:

6.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply at the PLR as those describe
   for the head end in [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].
