This document obsoletes RFC 5735. It describes the global and 
other specialized IPv4 address blocks that have been assigned by 
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  It does not address 
IPv4 address space assigned to operators and users through the 
Regional Internet Registries, nor does it address IPv4 address space 
assigned directly by IANA prior to the creation of the Regional 
Internet Registries.  It also does not address allocations or 
assignments of IPv6 addresses or autonomous system numbers.

<section title="Introduction">

    <t>

Throughout its  history, the Internet has employed a 
central Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) responsible 
for the allocation and assignment of various identifiers needed 
for the operation of the Internet <xref target="RFC1174"/>.  In the 
case of the IPv4 address space, the IANA allocates parts of the 
address space to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) according to their 
established needs.  These RIRs are responsible for the registration 
of IPv4 addresses to operators and users of the Internet within 
their regions.

    </t>

    <t>
                
On an ongoing basis, the IANA has been designated by the IETF 
to make assignments in support of the Internet Standards 
Process <xref target="RFC2860"/>. Section 4 of this document describes that 
assignment process.
                
     </t>

     <t>

Small portions of the IPv4 address space have been allocated or
assigned directly by the IANA for global or other specialized
purposes.  These allocations and assignments have been 
documented in a variety of RFCs and other documents.  This 
document is intended to collect these scattered references and 
provide a current list of special use IPv4 addresses.

</t>

   <t>
                
 This document is a revision of RFC 5735 <xref target="RFC5735"/>, which it
 obsoletes; its primary purpose is to reflect the changes to the list of special
 IPv4 assignments since the publication of RFC 5735. It is a companion to <xref target="RFC5156"/> 
 which describes special IPv6 addresses.

        </t>

<section title="Terminology">
         
	<t>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

	</t>

</section>

<section title="Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks">

	<t>

		   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on "this"
		   network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32 may be used as a source address for 
		   this host on this network; other addresses within 0.0.0.0/8 may be
		   used to refer to specified hosts on this network <xref target="RFC1122"/>, section 3.2.1.3.

	</t>


	<t>
		   10.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for use in
		   private networks.  Its intended use is documented
		   in <xref target="RFC1918"/>. As described in that
	           RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear
		   on the public Internet. These addresses can be used
		   without any coordination with IANA or an Internet
		   registry.

	</t>

	<t>

		   127.0.0.0/8 - This block is assigned for use as the
		   Internet host loopback address.  A datagram sent by
		   a higher level protocol to an address anywhere
		   within this block loops back inside the host.
		   This is ordinarily implemented using only
		   127.0.0.1/32 for loopback.  As described in
		   <xref target="RFC1122"/>, Section 3.2.1.3,
		   addresses within the entire 127.0.0.0/8 block do
		   not legitimately appear on any network anywhere.

	</t>

<t>
        100.64.0.0/10 - This block is used as Shared Address Space. 
        <xref target="RFC6598"/> states that Shared Address 
        Space can only be used in Service Provider networks or on routing 
        equipment that is able to do address translation across router the 
        interfaces when addresses are identical on two different interfaces.
</t>

	<t>

		   169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "link local" block.  As described in 
	           <xref target="RFC3927"/>, it is allocated for communication between hosts 
	           on a single link.  Hosts obtain these addresses by auto-configuration, such 
	           as when a DHCP server cannot be found.

	</t>


	<t>
		   172.16.0.0/12 - This block is set aside for use in
		   private networks.  Its intended use is documented
		   in <xref target="RFC1918"/>.  As described in that
	           RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear
		   the public Internet. These addresses can be used
		   without any coordination with IANA or an Internet
		   registry.
	</t>

        <t>
                   192.0.0.0/24 - This block is reserved for IETF protocol assignments.
		   At the time of writing this document, there are no current assignments.
		   Allocation policy for future assignments is given in <xref target="RFC5736"/>.
        </t>

	<t>

		   192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as
		   "TEST-NET-1" for use in documentation and example
		   code.  It is often used in conjunction with domain
		   names example.com or example.net in vendor and
		   protocol documentation.  As described in
	           <xref target="RFC5737"/>, addresses within this
	           block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can
		   be used without any coordination with IANA or an
		   Internet registry. See <xref target="RFC1166"/>.

	</t>


	<t>

		192.88.99.0/24 - This block is allocated for use as
		6to4 relay anycast addresses, in to
		<xref target="RFC3068"/>. In contrast with previously
		described blocks, packets destined to addresses from
		this block do appear in the public
		Internet. <xref target="RFC3068"/>, Section 7
		describes operational practices to prevent the
		malicious use of this block in routing protocols.

	</t>


	<t>

		   192.168.0.0/16 - This block is set aside for use in
		   private networks. Its intended use is documented in
		   <xref target="RFC1918"/>.  As described in that
	           RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear
		   the public Internet. These addresses can be used
		   without any coordination with IANA or an Internet
		   registry.

	</t>


	<t>

		   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated for use in benchmark
		   tests of network interconnect devices.  <xref target="RFC2544"/> explains
	           that this range was assigned to minimize the chance of conflict in case a 
	           testing device were to be accidentally connected to part of the Internet.
	           Packets with source addresses from this range are not meant to be 
	           forwarded across the Internet.

	</t>

        <t>
                
                198.51.100.0/24 - This block is assigned as
                "TEST-NET-2" for use in documentation and example
                code.  It is often used in conjunction with domain
                names example.com or example.net in vendor and
                protocol documentation.  As described in
                <xref target="RFC5737"/>, addresses within this
                block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can
                be used without any coordination with IANA or an
                Internet registry.
                
        </t>

        <t>
                
                203.0.113.0/24 - This block is assigned as
                "TEST-NET-3" for use in documentation and example
                code.  It is often used in conjunction with domain
                names example.com or example.net in vendor and
                protocol documentation.  As described in
                <xref target="RFC5737"/>, addresses within this
                block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can
                be used without any coordination with IANA or an
                Internet registry.
                
        </t>

	<t>
		   224.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class D address
		   space, is allocated for use in IPv4 multicast address assignments.
		   The IANA guidelines for assignments from this space are described in
		   <xref target="RFC3171"/>.

	</t>


	<t>
		   240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the
		   Class E address space, is reserved for future use,
		   see <xref target="RFC1112"/>, section 4.

		   <vspace blankLines='1'/>

		   The one exception to this is the "limited
		   broadcast" destination address 255.255.255.255. As
		   described in <xref target="RFC0919"/> and
		   <xref target="RFC0922"/>, packets with this
		   destination address are not forwarded at IP layer.

<section title="Assignments of IPv4 Blocks for New Specialized Uses">

		<t>

The IANA has responsibility for making assignments of protocol
parameters used in the Internet according to the requirements of the
"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority" <xref target="RFC2860"/>.  Among other things,
<xref target="RFC2860"/> requires that protocol parameters be assigned according to 
the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including Proposed,
Draft, and full Internet Standards and Best Current Practice
documents, and any other RFC that calls for IANA assignment.

		</t>

		<t>

The domain name and IP address spaces involve policy issues (in
addition to technical issues) so that the requirements of <xref target="RFC2860"/>
do not apply generally to those spaces.  Nonetheless, the IANA is
responsible for ensuring assignments of IPv4 addresses as needed in
support of the Internet Standards Process.  When a portion of the
IPv4 address space is specifically required by an RFC, the technical
requirements (e.g., size, prefix length) for the portion should be
described <xref target="RFC5226"/>.  Immediately before the RFC is published, the
IANA will, in consultation with the Regional Internet Registries,
make the necessary assignment and notify the RFC Editor of the
particulars for inclusion in the RFC as published.

		</t>

		<t>

As required by <xref target="RFC2860"/>, the IANA will also make necessary
experimental assignments of IPv4 addresses, also in consultation
with the Regional Internet Registries.

		</t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

	<t>

This document describes the IANA's past and current practices and
does not create any new requirements for assignments or allocations
by the IANA.

	</t>

</section>

		

<section title="Security Considerations">

		<t>

The particular assigned values of special use IPv4 addresses
cataloged in this document do not directly raise security issues.
However, the Internet does not inherently protect against abuse of
these addresses; if you expect (for instance) that all packets from 
a private address space such as the 10.0.0.0/8 block or the link 
local block 169.254.0.0/16 originate within your subnet, all 
routers at the border of your network should filter such packets 
that originate from outside your network. Attacks have been mounted 
that depend on the unexpected use of some of these addresses.

		</t>
        
        <t>
                
It should also be noted that some of these address blocks may be used 
legitimately outside of a single administrative domain, and may appear 
on the global Internet. Security policy SHOULD NOT blindly filter all 
of these address spaces without due consideration, and network operators 
are encouraged to review this document, and references contained therein, 
and determine what security policies should be associated with each of 
these address blocks within their specific operating environments.
