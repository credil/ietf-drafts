Abstract

   Currently, most multimedia applications utilize a combination of 
   real-time transport protocol (RTP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). 
   Application programs at the source end format payload data into RTP 
   packets using RTP specifications and dispatch them using unreliable 
   UDP along a single path. Multipath transport is an important way to 
   improve the efficiency of data delivery. In order to apply the 
   framework of multipath transport system based on application-level 
   relay (MPTS-AR) to RTP-based multipath applications, this document 
   defines a multipath real-time transport protocol based on 
   application-level relay (MPRTP-AR), which is a concrete 
   application-specific multipath transport protocol (MPTP). Packet 
   formats and packet types of MPRTP-AR follow the common rules 
   specified in MPTP profile. Based on MPRTP-AR, RTP-based multimedia 
   applications can make full use of the advantages brought by the 
   multipath transport system based on application-level relay.

1. Introduction

   Currently, most multimedia applications utilize a combination of 
   real-time transport protocol (RTP) [1] and user datagram protocol 
   (UDP). Application programs at the source end format payload data 
   into RTP packets using RTP specifications and dispatch them using 
   unreliable UDP along a single path. Multipath transport is an 
   important way to improve the efficiency of data delivery. In order to
   apply the framework of multipath transport system based on 
   application-level relay (MPTS-AR) [12] to RTP-based multipath 
   applications, this document defines a multipath real-time transport 
   protocol based on application-level relay (MPRTP-AR), which is a 
   concrete application-specific multipath transport protocol (MPTP). 
   Packet formats and packet types of MPRTP-AR follow the common rules 
   specified in MPTP profile [12]. Based on MPRTP-AR, RTP-based 
   multimedia applications can make full use of the advantages brought 
   by the multipath transport system based on application-level relay.
   
2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [2].
   
3. Overview

   The protocol stack architecture of the MPRTP-AR is shown in figure 1.
   MPRTP-AR is divided into two sub-layers: RTP sub-layer and multipath 
   transport control (MPTC) sub-layer. RTP sub-layer is fully compatible
   with the existing RTP specifications and provides upper applications 
   with the same application programming interfaces (APIs) as those by 
   RTP. MPTC sub-layer provides essential support for multipath 
   transport, including path management, flow partitioning, subflow 
   packaging, subflow recombination, subflow reporting and so on. At the
   user agent sender, RTP sub-layer first formats the data received from
   upper application into RTP packets and then passes them to lower MPTC
   sub-layer. MPTC sub-layer further formats the RTP packets into 
   MPRTP-AR data packets. At the user agent receiver, MPTC sub-layer 
   extracts the RTP/RTCP packet by removing the fixed header fields of 
   MPRTP-AR data packet from the received packet and passes it directly 
   to upper RTP sub-layer. RTP sub-layer follows the normal process 
   defined in RTP specification to restore original data flow. This 
   design decision is to maximize backwards compatibility with existing
   RTP applications. Moreover, MPRTP-AR can make full use of real-time 
   transport functions provided by RTP including payload type 
   identification, sequence numbering and timestamping.

          Figure 1. The protocol stack architecture of MPRTP-AR

   As defined in MPTP profile, MPRTP-AR packets are divided into two 
   types: MPRTP-AR data packets and MPRTP-AR control packets. MPRTP-AR 
   control packets include MPRTP-AR keep-alive packets and MPRTP-AR 
   report packets.

   Besides RTP packets, RTP sub-layer generates real-time transport 
   control (RTCP) packets following the normal RTCP defined in [1] to 
   provide the overall media statistics. Payload content of MPTC 
   sub-layer includes RTP packets and RTCP packets. In MPTC sub-layer, 
   each RTP/RTCP packet is treated as an independent piece of payload 
   data and packaged into an MPRTP-AR data packet. RTCP packets may be
   treated the exact same as RTP packets which are distributed across 
   multiple paths. RTCP packets may also be transferred along any one of
   active paths, such as the default path or the best path among all 
   active paths based on quality of delivery. 

   When RTP and RTCP packets are multiplexed, the RTCP packet type field
   occupies the same position in the packet as the combination of the 
   RTP marker (M) bit and the RTP payload type (PT). This field is used 
   to distinguish RTP and RTCP packets. It is RECOMMENDED that RTP 
   sub-layer follows the guidelines in the RTP/AVP profile [3] for the 
   choice of RTP payload type values, with the additional restriction in
   [4].

   MPRTP-AR report packets are used to monitor the transport quality of 
   the path. MPRTP-AR-aware user agent MUST generate individual MPRTP-AR
   report packets for per subflow. The user agent sender generates 
   MPRTP-AR Sender Reports (SR) for each subflow and sends them along

   the associated active path. The user agent receiver generates 
   MPRTP-AR Receiver Reports (RR) when receiving a MPRTP-AR SR and sends
   them along the default path. The user agent sender may modify its 
   strategies of flow partitioning and scheduling based on the feedback
   in MPRTP-AR RRs.

4. MPRTP-AR User Agent Behavior

   In addition to user agent behaviors defined in [12], MPRTP-AR user 
   agent needs to follow the following behaviors to support multipath 
   transport for RTP-based multimedia applications.

4.1	Flow Partitioning

   If multiple paths are used concurrently, the original multimedia 
   stream should be divided into several substreams. The partition may 
   be done based on media type, encoding scheme and path 
   characteristics. Flow partitioning methods can be divided into 
   coding-aware partitioning methods and coding-unaware partitioning
   methods. Coding-unaware partitioning methods can be performed in MPTC
   sub-layer. The formatted RTP/RTCP packets are dispatched balancedly 
   to subflows based on the delivery quality of the associated active 
   paths.

   For multimedia applications, a multistream coder using layered 
   coding, multiple description coding or object-oriented coding can 
   produce multiple compressed media flows. In this case, coding-aware 
   partitioning methods could be performed in RTP sub-layer. In layered 
   coding, a flow is either the base layer or one of the enhancement 
   layers; in multiple description coding, a flow typically consists of 
   packets from a description; in object-oriented coding, various 
   objects are coded individually and placed in so-called elementary 
   steams. Each coding flow corresponds to a separate subflow, or 
   several coding flows are multiplexed into one subflow. Data 
   participant in this way can effectively reduce the correlations among
   subflows.

4.2	Subflow Packaging

   For each subflow, the assigned RTP packets are treated as payload 
   data and formatted into MPRTP-AR data packets. The initial SSSN is 
   randomly generated when the subflow is first established and the SSSN
   in subsequent subflow MPRTP-AR data packets for RTP packets is 
   monotonically increasing. 

   The assigned RTCP packets are also formatted into MPRTP-AR data 
   packets except for the difference that the SSSN is fixed to zero.

Internet-Draft                    MPRTP-AR                     July 2013
    

4.3	Subflow Recombination

   The user agent receiver recombines the original data flow according
   to MPRTP-AR data packets received from multiple paths. After 
   receiving a MPRTP-AR data packet, MPTCP sub-layer first extracts the
   RTP/RTCP packet by removing the fixed header fields of MPTP data 
   packet from the received packet and passes it directly to upper RTP 
   sub-layer. The RTP sub-layer follows the normal process defined in 
   RTP specification.

4.4	Subflow Reporting

   User agent generates MPRTP-AR reports for per subflow to monitor the 
   quality of path delivery. The user agent sender generates MPRTP-AR 
   Sender Reports (SR) for each subflow and sends them along the 
   associated active path. The user agent receiver generates MPRTP-AR 
   Receiver Reports (RR) when receiving a MPRTP-AR SR and sends them 
   along the default path.

   The user agent sender calculates the transmission interval of MPTP 
   SRs according to some strategy. The user agent sender may generate 
   MPRTP-AR SRs at a constant rate. In this case, it is recommended that
   the default interval of subflow MPRTP-AR SRs be one second. The user 
   agent sender may also generate MPRTP-AR SRs at a variable rate. For 
   example, the report traffic is limited to a small fraction of the 
   associated subflow data traffic. In this case, it is recommended that
   the fraction of the subflow data traffic added for subflow report be 
   fixed at 5%. 

   Reception quality feedback is useful for the user agent sender who 
   may modify its strategies of flow partitioning and scheduling based 
   on the feedback.

   Cumulative counts are used in both the MPRTP-AR SRs and RRs so that 
   differences may be calculated between any two reports to make 
   measurements over both short and long time periods, and to provide 
   resilience against the loss of a report. The difference between the 
   last two reports received can be used to estimate the recent quality 
   of the distribution. The NTP timestamp is included so that rates may 
   be calculated from these differences over the interval between two 
   reports. 

   An example calculation is the packet loss rate over the interval 
   between two MPRTP-AR RRs. The difference in the cumulative number of
   packets lost gives the number lost during that interval. 
   The difference in the highest SSSNs received gives the number of 
   packets expected during the interval. The ratio of these two is the 
   packet loss fraction over the interval. This ratio provides a

   short-term packet loss measurement if the two reports are 
   consecutive. The loss rate per second can be obtained by dividing the
   loss fraction by the difference in NTP timestamps, expressed in 
   seconds. The number of packets received is the number of packets 
   expected minus the number lost. 

   In addition to the cumulative counts which allow both long-term and 
   short-term measurements using differences between reports, MPRTP-AR 
   RRs includes an interarrival jitter field which provides short-term 
   measurement of network congestion from a single report. Packet loss 
   tracks persistent congestion while the jitter measure tracks 
   transient congestion. The jitter measure may indicate congestion 
   before it leads to packet loss. The interarrival jitter field is only
   a snapshot of the jitter at the time of a report and is not intended 
   to be taken quantitatively. Rather, it is intended for comparison 
   across a number of reports.

5. MPRTP-AR Packet Format

   Packet types and packet formats of MPRTP-AR follow the common rules 
   specified in MPTP profile. As defined in MPTP profile, MPRTP-AR 
   packets are divided into two types: MPRTP-AR data packets and 
   MPRTP-AR control packets. MPRTP-AR control packets include MPRTP-AR 
   keep-alive packets and MPRTP-AR report packets.

5.1	MPRTP-AR Data Packet

   As stated in section 3, the RTP packets and RTCP packets are packaged
   into MPRTP-AR data packets intact. Each RTP packet and RTCP packet 
   corresponds to a MPRTP-AR data packet.

5.1.1 MPRTP-AR Data Packet for RTP packet

   A MPRTP-AR data packet carrying a RTP packet consists of a fixed 
   eight-octet MPTP header and an intact RTP packet. An example is shown
   below:

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 
   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to indicate that this packet is
   a MPRTP-AR data packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   For RTP-based multimedia applications, latency and jitter are the 
   primary concerns, and occasional packet lost is acceptable. So the
   delay bit in the type of service (TOS) field is set to indicate that 
   prompt delivery is important for this packet.

   The initial SSSN is randomly generated when the subflow is first 
   established. The SSSN is increased by one for each subsequent 
   MPRTP-AR data packets carrying RTP packets of the same subflow.

5.1.2 MPRTP-AR Data Packet for RTCP packet

   A MPRTP-AR data packet carrying a RTCP packet consists of a fixed 
   eight-octet MPTP header and an intact RTCP packet. An example is 
   shown below:

   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to indicate that this packet 
   is a MPRTP-AR data packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   In a RTP session, RTCP packets have higher procedure and reliability
   than RTP packets. So the precedence and reliability bits of the type 
   of service (TOS) field are set to indicate that the payload data in 
   this packet is more important and requires a higher level of effort 
   to ensure delivery.

   The SSSN field in MPRTP-AR data packets carrying RTCP packets is 
   fixed to zero.

5.2	MPRTP-AR Control Packet

   MPRTP-AR control packets include MPRTP-AR keep-alive packets and 
   MPRTP-AR report packets. MPRTP-AR report packets include MPRTP-AR 
   Sender Reports (SRs) and MPRTP-AR Receiver Reports (RRs).

   MPRTP-AR SR summarizes the data transmissions of the associated 
   ubflow. The fields have the following meaning:   

   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to zero to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR control packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   The MPTP control packet type field is set to 1 to indicate that this
   packet is a MPRTP-AR SR.

   NTP timestamp: 64 bits
      Indicates the wallclock time when this report was sent so that it 
	  may be used in combination with timestamps returned in receiver 
	  reports to measure round-trip propagation to the user agent 
	  receiver.

      Wallclock time (absolute date and time) is represented using the 
	  timestamp format of the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is in 
	  seconds relative to 0h UTC on 1 January 1900 [5]. The full 
	  resolution NTP timestamp is a 64-bit unsigned fixed-point number 
	  with the integer part in the first 32 bits and the fractional part
	  in the last 32 bits. An implementation is not required to run the 
	  Network Time Protocol in order to use this MPTP extension. On a 
	  system that has no notion of wallclock time but does have some 
	  system-specific clock such as "system uptime", a user agent sender
	  MAY use that clock as a reference to calculate relative NTP 
	  timestamps.

	  transmitted within a subflow by the user agent sender since 
	  starting transmission up until the time this MPRTP-AR SR was

   subflow's octet count: 32 bits
      The total number of payload octets (i.e., not including header or 
	  padding) transmitted in MPRTP-AR data packets by the user agent 
	  sender since starting transmission up until the time this MPRTP-AR

   MPTP RR conveys statistics on the reception of MPTP data packets from
   a single subflow. The fields have the following meaning:

   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to zero to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR control packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   The MPTP control packet type field is set to 2 to indicate that this
   packet is a MPRTP-AR RR.

   The highest subflow-specific sequence number (SSSN) received: 16 bits
      The highest subflow-specific sequence number received in an 
	  MPRTP-AR data packets from a subflow.

   Cumulative number of packets lost: 24 bits
      The total number of MPRTP-AR data packets from a subflow that have

      been lost since the beginning of reception. Note that a user agent
	  receiver cannot tell whether any packets were lost after the last 
	  one received. This number is defined to be the number of packets 
	  expected less the number of packets actually received. The number 
	  of packets expected is defined to be the highest SSSN of MPTP data
	  packets received less the initial SSSN received. The number of 
	  packets received includes any which are late. Thus, packets that 
	  arrive late are not counted as lost. 

   Interarrival jitter: 32 bits
      An estimate of the statistical variance of the interarrival time 
	  of the MPRTP-AR data packet with non-zero SSSN value, measured in
	  timestamp units and expressed as an unsigned integer. The 
	  interarrival jitter J is defined to be the mean deviation 
	  (smoothed absolute value) of the difference D in packet spacing at
	  the user agent receiver compared to the user agent sender for a 
	  pair of successive packets in a subflow. As shown in the equation 
	  below, the difference D is also equivalent to the difference in 
	  the "relative transit time" for the two successive packets; the 
	  relative transit time is the difference between a packet's RTP 
	  timestamp and the user agent receiver's clock at the time of 
	  arrival, measured in the same units. 

      If Si is the RTP timestamp from packet i, and Ri is the time of 
	  arrival in RTP timestamp units for packet i, then for two packets
	  i and j, D may be expressed as

         D(i,j) = (Rj - Ri) - (Sj - Si) = (Rj - Sj) - (Ri - Si)

      The interarrival jitter SHOULD be calculated continuously as each 
	  MPTP data packet with non-zero SSSN value i is received from a 
	  subflow, using this difference D for that packet and the previous 
	  packet i-1 in order of arrival (not necessarily in sequence), 
	  according to the formula

         J(i) = J(i-1) + (|D(i-1,i)| - J(i-1))/16

      This algorithm is the optimal first-order estimator and the gain 
	  parameter 1/16 gives a good noise reduction ratio while 
	  maintaining a reasonable rate of convergence [11].

      Whenever a MPRTP-AR RR is issued, the current value of J is 
	  sampled.

   Last SR timestamp (LSR): 32 bits
      The middle 32 bits out of 64 in the NTP timestamp received as part
	  of the most recent MPRTP-AR SR from a subflow. If no MPRTP-AR SR 
	  has been received yet, the field is set to zero.

   Delay since last SR (DLSR): 32 bits
      The delay, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, between 
	  receiving the last MPRTP-AR SR from a subflow and sending this 
	  MPRTP-AR RR. If no MPRTP-AR SR has been received yet from this 
	  subflow, the DLSR field is set to zero.

   The user agent sender can compute the round-trip propagation delay to
   the user agent receiver along a specific active path by doing the 
   following. The user agent sender records the time A when this 
   MPRTP-AR RR is received, calculates the total round-trip time A-LSR 
   using the last SR timestamp (LSR) field, and then subtracting this 
   field to leave the round-trip propagation delay as (A - LSR - DLSR).

   MPRTP-AR keep-alive packet is used to keep the active path alive. It 
   only contains a fixed eight-octet MPTP header.

   The MPTP packet type (T) field is set to zero to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR control packet.

   The application-specific MPTP type (AMT) field is set to 1 to 
   indicate that this packet is a MPRTP-AR packet.

   The MPTP control packet type field is set to 3 to indicate that this 
   packet is a MPRTP-AR keep-alive packet.

6. SDP Considerations

6.1	Signaling MPTP Capability in SDP

   This document defines a new mptp-name value for the mptp-relay 
   attribute: "mprtp-ar" for RTP-based multimedia application-specific 
   MPTP, i.e. MPRTP-AR.

   RTP and RTCP packets are multiplexed to transport. So the rtcp-mux 
   attribute MUST be used in Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8] to 
   indicate support for multiplexing of RTP and RTCP packets [4]. When 
   an endpoint receives an SDP containing "a=mptp-relay" but without 
   "a=rtcp-mux", the endpoint MUST infer that the peer, if as a user

   agent sender, supports multiplexing of RTP and RTCP packets.

   A user agent sender MAY use multiple paths concurrently to increase 
   throughput. If the desired media rate exceeds the current media rate,
   the user agent sender MUST renegotiate the application specific 
   ("b=AS:xxx") [8] bandwidth.

6.2	An Offer/Answer Example

   We take the usage scenario shown in Section 5.1 in [12] as an 
   example. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [7] and SDP is used to 
   negotiate a multipath session following the offer/answer model [9].

   User A includes an initial SDP offer in the session invitation 
   message. The initial SDP offer is shown as following. 

   Initial Offer:
      v=0

      a=mptp-relay:mprtp-ar
      a=rtcp-mux

   When the invitation message is processed by the server system, two 
   candidate relay paths are assigned for the media flow from user B to 
   user A. The initial SDP offer in the session invitation message is 
   modified as shown below. The IP addresses of RTP relay-1/relay-2/
   relay-3 are 192.0.3.1, 192.0.4.1 and 192.0.5.1 respectively.

   If user B accepts the invitation, it includes an initial SDP answer 
   in the session reply message. The initial SDP answer is shown as 
   following.
