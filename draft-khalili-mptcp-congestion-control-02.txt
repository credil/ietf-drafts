 Opportunistic Linked-Increases Congestion Control Algorithm for MPTCP
               draft-khalili-mptcp-congestion-control-02


Abstract

   This document describes the mechanism of OLIA, the "Opportunistic
   Linked Increases Algorithm". OLIA is a congestion control algorithm
   for MPTCP. The current congestion control algorithm of MPTCP, LIA
   [4], forces a tradeoff between optimal congestion balancing and
   responsiveness. OLIA's design departs from this tradeoff and provide
   these properties simultaneously. Hence, it solves the identified
   performance problems with LIA while retaining non-flappiness and
   responsiveness behavior of LIA, as shown by different studies [5, 6,
   7, 8]. OLIA is now part of the UCLouvain's MPTCP implementation [9].

1 Introduction

   The current MPTCP implementation uses a congestion control algorithm
   called LIA, the "Linked-Increases" algorithm [4]. The design of LIA
   forces a tradeoff between optimal congestion balancing and
   responsiveness. Hence, to provide good responsiveness, LIA's current
   implementation must depart from optimal congestion balancing. This
   leads to important performance issues (refer to [5] and [6]): (i) in
   some scenarios upgrading TCP users to MPTCP results in a significant
   drop in the aggregate throughput in the network without any benefit
   for anybody; and (ii) MPTCP users can be excessively aggressive
   toward TCP users. 

   In this draft, we introduce OLIA, the "opportunistic linked increases
   algorithm", as an alternative to LIA. Contrary to LIA, OLIA's design
   is not based on a trade-off between responsiveness and optimal
   congestion balancing; it can provide both simultaneously [5].

   Similarly to LIA, OLIA couples the additive increases and uses
   unmodified TCP behavior in the case of a loss. The difference between
   LIA and OLIA is in the increase part. OLIA's increase part, Equation
   (1), has two terms:

    - The first term is an adaptation of the increase term of Kelly and
    Voice's algorithm [10]. This term is essential to provide optimal
    resource pooling.

    - The second term guarantees responsiveness and non-flappiness of
    OLIA. By measuring the number of transmitted bytes since the last
    loss, it reacts to events within the current window and adapts to
    changes faster than the first term.

   By adapting the window increases as a function of RTTs, OLIA also
   compensates for different RTTs. As OLIA is rooted on the optimal
   algorithm of [10], it provides fairness and optimal congestion
   balancing. Because of the second term, it is responsive and non-
   flappy.

   OLIA is implemented in the Linux kernel and is now a part of
   UCLouvain's MPTCP implementation. In [5], we study the performance of
   MPTCP with OLIA over a testbed, by simulations and by theoretical
   analysis. We prove theoretically that OLIA is Pareto-optimal and that
   it satisfies the design goals of MPTCP described in [4]. Hence, it
   can provide optimal congestion balancing and fairness in the network.
   Our measurements and simulations indicate that MPTCP with OLIA is as
   responsive and non-flappy as MPTCP with LIA and that it solves the
   identified problems with LIA. Recent studies show that MPTCP with
   OLIA always outperforms MPTCP with LIA and is very responsive to the

2 The set of best paths, paths with maximum windows, and collected paths

   A MPTCP connection has access to one or more paths (subflows). Let
   all_paths be the set of these paths and r be one of them. We denote
   by l_{1r} the number of bytes that were successfully transmitted over
   path r between the last two losses seen on r, by l_{2r} the number of
   bytes that are successfully transmitted over r after the last loss,
   and by l_r=max{l_{1r},l_{2r}} the smoothed estimation of number of
   bytes transmitted on r between last two losses. 

   l_{1r} and l_{2r} can be measured by using information that is
   already available to a regular TCP user:

    - For each ACK on r: l_{2r} <- l_{2r} + (number of bytes that are
    acknowledged by ACK),

    - For each loss on r: l_{1r} <- l_{2r} and l_{2r} <- 0.

   l_{1r} and l_{2r} are initially set to zero when the connection is
   established. If no losses have been observed on r until now, then
   l_{1r}=0 and l_{2r} is the total number of bytes transmitted on r.  

   Let rtt_r be the round-trip time observed on path r (e.g. the
   smoothed round-trip time used by regular TCP) and w_r be the
   congestion windows on path r. We denote by best_paths the set of
   paths r in all_paths that have the maximum value of l_r*l_r/rtt_r, by
   max_w_paths the set of paths r in all_paths with largest w_r, and by
   collected_paths the set of best paths that do not have maximum window
   size, i.e.:

    - best_paths = { r | r = arg max_{p in all_paths} (l_p*l_p/rtt_p) } 

    - max_w_paths = { r | r = arg max_{p in all_paths} (w_p) }

    - collected_paths = { r | r in best_paths and not in max_w_paths }.

   where arg max is the argument of maximum, the set of points of the
   given argument for which the given function is maximum. arg max is
   applied over all paths p in all_paths.    

   best_paths represents the set of paths that are presumably the best
   paths (in term of transmission rate) for the user: 1/l_r can be
   considered as an estimate of byte loss probability on path r, and
   hence the rate that path r can provide to a TCP user can be estimated
   by (2*l_r)^{1/2}/rtt_r. A collected path is a path that is presumably
   good but is not fully used. The set collected_paths can be empty.
   Note that l_{1r}, l_{2r}, l_r, rtt_r, w_r, best_paths, max_w_paths
   and collected_paths are all functions of time.

3 Opportunistic Linked-Increases Algorithm

   In this section, we introduce OLIA. OLIA is a window-based
   congestion-control algorithm. It couples the increase of congestion
   windows and uses unmodified TCP behavior in the case of a loss. OLIA
   is an alternative for LIA, the current congestion control of MPTCP. 

   The algorithm only applies to the increase part of the congestion
   avoidance phase. The fast retransmit and fast recovery algorithms, as
   well as the multiplicative decrease of the congestion avoidance
   phase, are the same as in TCP [2]. We also use a similar slow start
   algorithm as in TCP, with the modification that we set the ssthresh
   (slow start threshold) to be 1 MSS if multiple paths are established.
   In the case of a single path flow, we use the same minimum ssthresh
   as in TCP (i.e. 2 MSS). The purpose of this modification is to avoid
   transmitting unnecessary traffic over congested paths when multiple
   paths are available to a user. Note that this modification will not
   affect the single path TCP. 

   As defined before, we denote by w_r the congestion windows on the
   path r and by MSS_r the maximum segment size on this path. We assume
   that w_r is maintained in bytes.   

   Our proposed "Opportunistic Linked-Increases Algorithm" (OLIA) must:

    - For each ACK on path r, increase w_r by
                                    
                    w_r/rtt_r^2                      alpha_r     
     (       --------------------------         +   --------- )    (1)
         (SUM_{p in all_paths} (w_p/rtt_p))^2          w_r     
                                    
    multiplied by MSS_r * bytes_acked. 

   The summation in the denominator is over all paths p in all_paths.

   alpha_r is calculated as follows:

    - If r is in collected_paths, then            
                                    
                                 1/number_of_paths 
                     alpha_r = --------------------
                                 |collected_paths|   

    - If r is in max_w_paths and if collected_paths is not empty, then 
                                    
                                 1/number_of_paths
                     alpha_r = - -----------------
                                   |max_w_paths|

INTERNET DRAFT          MPTCP Congestion Control        October 21, 2013


    - Otherwise, alpha_r=0.

   |collected_paths| and |max_w_paths| are the number of paths in
   collected_paths and in max_w_paths. Note that the sum of all alpha_r
   is equal to 0. 

   The first term in (1) is an adaptation of Kelly and Voice's increase
   term [10] and provides the optimal  resource pooling (Kelly and
   Voice's algorithm is based on scalable TCP; the first term in (1) is
   a TCP compatible version of their algorithm that compensates also for
   different RTTs). The second term, with alpha_r, guarantees
   responsiveness and non-flappiness of our algorithm.

   By definition of alpha_r, if all the best paths have the largest
   window size, then alpha_r=0 for any r. This is because we already use
   the capacity available to the user by using all the best path. 

   If there is any best path with a small window size, i.e. if
   collected_paths is not empty, then alpha_r is positive for all r in
   collected_paths and negative for all r in max_w_paths. Hence, our
   algorithm increases windows faster on the paths that are presumably
   best but that have small windows. The increase will be slower on the
   paths with maximum windows. In this case, OLIA re-forwards traffic
   from fully used paths (i.e. paths in max_w_paths) to paths that have
   free capacity available to the users (i.e. paths in collected_paths).

   In [4], three goals have been proposed for the design of a practical
   multipath congestion control algorithm : (1) Improve throughput: a
   multipath TCP user should perform at least as well as a TCP user that
   uses the best path available to it. (2) Do no harm: a multipath TCP
   user should never take up more capacity from any of its paths than a
   TCP user. And (3) balance congestion: a multipath TCP algorithm
   should balance congestion in the network, subject to meeting the
   first two goals.

   Our theoretical results in [5] show that OLIA fully satisfies these
   three goals. LIA, however, fails to fully satisfy the goal (3) as
   discussed in [5] and [6]. Moreover, in [5], we show through
   measurements and by simulation that our algorithm is as responsive
   and non-flappy as LIA and that it can solve the identified problems
   with LIA. In [7], Chen et al. study how MPTCP with LIA and OLIA
   performs in the wild with a common wireless environment, namely using
   both WiFi and Cellular simultaneously. Their results show that MPTCP
   with OLIA is very responsive to the changes in the environment and
   always outperforms MPTCP with LIA. Furthermore, using Experimental
   Design, Paasch et al. [8] show that MPTCP with OLIA satisfy the
   design goal of MPTCP in a very wide range of scenarios and always
   outperform MPTCP with LIA.

4 Practical considerations

   Calculation of alpha requires performing costly floating point
   operation whenever an ACK received over path r. In practice, however,
   we can integrate calculation of alpha and Equation (1) together. Our
   algorithm can be therefore simplified as the following. 

   For each ACK on the path r:

    - If r is in collected_paths, increase w_r by             
                                    
         w_r/rtt_r^2                          1                
      -----------------   +   ------------------------------------   (2)
    (SUM_p (w_p/rtt_p))^2    w_r * number_of_paths * |collected_paths|

    multiplied by MSS_r * bytes_acked.


    - If r is in max_w_paths and if collected_paths is not empty,
    increase w_r by 
                                    
         w_r/rtt_r^2                          1                
      ----------------    -    -------------------------------       (3)
    (SUM_p (w_p/rtt_p))^2     w_r * number_of_paths * |max_w_paths|   

    multiplied by MSS_r * bytes_acked.

    - Otherwise, increase w_r by
                                    
                            (w_r/rtt_r^2)    
                     --------------------------           (4)
                        (SUM_p (w_p/rtt_p))^2  
                                    
    multiplied by MSS_r * bytes_acked.

   The summation in the dominator of equations (2), (3), and (4) is over
   the path p in all_paths. To compute the increase, we only need to
   determine the sets collected_paths and max_w_paths when an ACK is
   received on the path r. We can further simplify the algorithm by
   updating the sets collected_paths and max_w_paths only once per
   round-trip time or whenever there is a drop on the path. 

   We can see from above that in some cases (i.e. when r is max_w_paths
   and collected_paths is not empty) the increase could be negative.
   This is a property of our algorithm as in this case OLIA re-forwards
   traffic from paths in max_w_paths to paths in collected_paths. It is
   easy to show that using our algorithm, w_r >= 1 for any path r.

5 Discussion 

   Our results in [5] show that the identified problems with current
   MPTCP implementation are not due to the nature of a window-based
   multipath protocol, but rather to the design of LIA. OLIA shows that
   it is possible to build an alternative to LIA that mitigates these
   problems and that is as responsive and non-flappy as LIA. 

   Our proposed algorithm can provide similar resource pooling as Kelly
   and Voice's algorithm [10] and fully satisfies the design goals of
   MPTCP described in [4]. Hence, it can provide optimal congestion
   balancing and fairness in the network [5]. Moreover, it is as
   responsive and non-flappy as LIA and outperforms LIA in realistic
   scenarios such as wireless networks (refer to [5, 7, 8]).   

   We therefore believe that mptcp working group should revisit the
   congestion control part of MPTCP and that an alternative algorithm,
   such as OLIA, should be considered.
