Abstract

   The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.  This
   often involves accessing the archived history of those email lists.
   Participants would like to have the ability to browse and search
   those archives using standard IMAP clients.  This memo captures the
   requirements for providing a service that would allow such browsing
   and searching.

Internet-Draft   IMAP Access to IETF Email List Archives        Mar 2013


1.  Introduction

   The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.  This
   often involves accessing the archived history of those email lists.
   Requirements for improved web-based browsing and searching of these
   archives are captured in [RFC6778].  Participants would like to have
   the ability to browse and search those archives using standard IMAP
   clients.  This memo captures the requirements for providing a service
   that would allow such browsing and searching.

   Discussion of this memo should take place on the ietf@ietf.org
   mailing list.


2.  Requirements for IMAP access to archived IETF lists

   Many participants would prefer to access the list archives using IMAP
   [RFC3501].  Providing this access while meeting the following
   requirements will likely require an IMAP server with specialized
   capabilities.

   o  The system should expose the archive using an IMAP interface, with
      each list represented as a mailbox.

   o  This interface must work with standard IMAP clients.

   o  The interface should allow users that have provided credentials to
      each have their own read/unread marks for messages.  Allowing
      other annotation is desirable.  The implementation should consider
      taking advantage of the IMAP extensions for ANNOTATE [RFC5257] and
      METADATA [RFC5464].

   o  The interface must have server-side searching enabled, and should
      support multiple simultaneous extensive searches.  The server
      should facilitate the enhanced search capabilities described in
      [RFC6778].  The implementation should consider taking advantage of
      the extensions defined for IMAP SORT and THREAD [RFC5256],
      multimailbox search [RFC6237], and fuzzy search [RFC6203].

   o  When the system requires credentials, it must use the
      datatracker's authentication system

      -  While the vast majority of archived lists have an open access
         policy, some archived lists have restricted archives.  The
         system must make it possible to limit access to a restricted
         archive based on login credentials.

      -  The system must not require credentials for accessing lists
         with open archives.  (But it is acceptable for a user to access
         such archives while providing credentials).


3.  Security Considerations

   Allowing IMAP as an interface for browsing and searching the archives
   of IETF email lists does not affect the security of the Internet in
   any significant fashion.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


5.  Acknowledgements

   This text was derived directly from an early version of the Internet
   Draft that became [RFC6778] which incorporated text suggestions from
   Alexey Melnikov, Pete Resnick, and S. Moonesamy.  Barry Leiba
   suggested several references to IMAP extensions for an implementation
   to consider.


6.  Changelog

6.1.  04 to 05

   o  Adapted text from RFC6778 to make it more clear that both
      authenticated and unauthenticated access should be supported.

6.2.  03 to 04

   o  Incorporated suggestions from Pete Resnick and Barry Leiba.

6.3.  02 to 03

   o  None - expiry refresh

6.4.  01 to 02

   o  Minor editorial changes

6.5.  00 to 01

   o  Added requirements to enable controlled access to restricted
      archives based on credentials

   o  Generalized the requirement to use the datatracker's credentials.

6.6.  00

   o  Split this set of requirements out from the mailarch doc so that
      this project could be pursued separately
