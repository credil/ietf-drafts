The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the third
version of the Internet-Standard Management Framework, termed
the SNMP version 3 Framework (SNMPv3).  This Framework is derived
from and builds upon both the original Internet-Standard Management
Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-Standard Management
Framework (SNMPv2).

The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of
the Framework over time.

The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is
strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157,
1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic
status.  This document obsoletes RFC 2570.

This document is a product of the SNMPv3 Working Group of the IETF.
