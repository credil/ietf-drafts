         RSVP-TE Extensions to Exchange MPLS-TP LSP Identifiers
           draft-zhang-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-tunnel-num-01

Abstract

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) identifiers document [RFC6370]
   specifies a initial set of identifiers, such as local assigned tunnel
   number and Global_ID, which can be used to form Maintenance Entity
   Point Identifier (MEP_ID).  As to some Operation, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM) functions, such as Connectivity Verification (CV)
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-cc-cv-rdi], source MEP_ID must be inserted in the
   OAM packets, so that the peer endpoint can compare the received and
   expected MEP_IDs to judge whether there is a mismatch [RFC6371],
   which means that the two MEP nodes need to pre-store each other's
   MEP_IDs.

   This document defines the signaling extensions to exchange the Label
   Switched Path (LSP) identifiers.

Internet-Draft   RSVP-TE Extentions for LSP Identifiers    November 2011


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) identifiers document [RFC6370]
   specifies a initial set of identifiers, such as local assigned tunnel
   number (Tunnel_Num) and Global_ID, which can be used to form
   Maintenance Entity Point Identifier (MEP_ID).  The MPLS-TP LSP_MEP_ID
   is Node_ID::Tunnel_Num::LSP_Num, and in situations where global
   uniqueness is required, this becomes: Global_ID::Node_ID::
   Tunnel_Num::LSP_Num. In order to realize some Operation,
   Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions, such as Connectivity
   Verification (CV) [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-cc-cv-rdi], source MEP-ID MUST be
   inserted in the OAM packets, in this way the peer endpoint can
   compare the received and expected MEP-IDs to judge whether there is a
   mismatch [RFC6371].  Hence, the two MEP nodes must pre-store each
   other's MEP-IDs before sending the CV packets.

   Obviously, the exchange of MEP_IDs can be accomplished by the Network
   Management System (NMS), but it is complex when the LSPs cross
   different adiminstration domains, which involves the cooperation of
   NMSs.  When the LSPs are set up by control plane, Resource
   ReserVation Protocol Traffic Engnieering (RSVP-TE) messages will be
   more suitable to realize the exchange of MEP_IDs.

   The specification of setting up co-routed bidirectional LSP is
   described in the document [RFC3473], which does not specify the
   Global_ID and locally configured Z9-Tunnel_Num. Similary, for
   associated bidirectional LSP
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp], the Global_ID may
   also be useful.  This document defines the signaling extensions to
   exchange the LSP identifiers.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Operation

3.1.  Co-routed Bidirectional LSP

   MPLS-TP co-routed bidirectional LSPs can be deployed across one or
   more administration domains, and NMS may exist in some administration
   domains, which knows the tunnel spaces of every node in it's
   responsible domain.  Consider that LSP1 is initialized at A1 node,
   and the "L" bit of the Attributes Flags TLV [RFC5420] may be set in



Zhang                     Expires May 16, 2012                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft   RSVP-TE Extentions for LSP Identifiers    November 2011


   the outgoing Path message.  If the "L" bit is set, the Connection TLV
   MUST be carried and Global_ID TLV is optional in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
   object.

   A "L" bit is defined in the Connection TLV.  When it is set, the Z9-
   Tunnel_Num is designated in the "Destination Tunnel Num" field.  If
   the Z9 node finds that this tunnel number is occupied, or it can not
   be used because of some local policies, an error MUST be generated
   "Notify error/ unavailable tunnel number".  Otherwise, the designated
   tunnel number must be adopted, and the Connection TLV may be inserted
   in the Resv message without any change.  In case the "L" bit is not
   set, a recommended Z9-Tunnel_Num may be filled in the "Destination
   Tunnel Num" field.  If the Z9 node finds that the recommended value
   can be used, the Connection TLV must be inserted in the Resv message
   without any change; else the recommended value can not be used or the
   "Destination Tunnel Num" field is empty, a new tunnel number will be
   allocated and filled into the Connection TLV that must be inserted in
   the Resv message.  While, that the "L" bit is set or not depends on
   the operators' preference.  For example, for the operators who are
   used to operate traditional transport network and familiar with the
   Transport-Centric operational model may prefer "L" bit set.  That the
   "L" bit is not set is more suitable for the operators who are
   familiar with the operation and maintenance of IP/MPLS network, or
   the MPLS-TP LSPs cross multiple administration domains.

   The Global_ID TLV is needed to be carried if the LSP is across
   different administrative domains, which can be inserted in the
   outgoing Path message at A1 node or added by the transit Autonomous
   System Border Router (ASBR) node that is in the same domain as A1
   node, and the value is A1's Global_ID.  Z9's Global_ID should be
   inserted in the Resv message at Z9 node or any other Label Swithed
   Routers (LSRs) that in the same domain as Z9, and the value is Z9's
   Global_ID.

3.2.  Associated Bidirectional LSP

   MPLS-TP associated bidirectional LSPs may also be deployed across one
   or more administration domains, and the Global_ID is needed to keep
   the MEP_ID globally unique.  Consider that the forward LSP is
   initialized at A1 node and the backward LSP is initialized at Z9
   node, the "L" bit of the Attributes Flags TLV may be set in each
   other's outgoing Path messages.  When the "L" bit is set, the
   Global_ID TLV with the value set to A1/Z9's Global_ID is optional in
   the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and can be inserted in the outgoing Path
   message at A1/Z9 node or added by the transit Autonomous System
   Border Router (ASBR) node that is in the same domain as A1/Z9 node.
   If this TLV is present in Resv message, it can be ignored.

4.  RSVP-TE Extensions

4.1.  LSP Attribute Flags

   The LSP Attribute Flags TLV is defined in [RFC5420], and this
   document introduces a new flag:

   One bit ("L", IANA to assign): "LSP identifier indication" is
   allocated in the LSP Attributes Flags TLV to be used in the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  If the "L" bit is set, it is indicating that
   A1/Z9 node needs to know each other's LSP identifer.

4.2.  Connection TLV

   The Connection TLV is carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object with the
   following format:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |            Type (TBD)         |              Length           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |L|         Reserved            |       Destination Tunnel Num  |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   L

       The L bit is set if the initiating node enforces the peer
       endpoint to configure the value carried in the field of
       "Destination Tunnle Num".

       If the bit is not set, the peer endpoint firstly tries to
       use the recommended tunnel number; it can use any other
	   unoccupied tunnnel numbers when the recommended tunnel
	   number is unavailable.

   Reserverd

       Must be set to 0 on transmit and ignored on receive.

   Destination Tunnel Num

       If the L bit is set, it indicates that the peer endpoint
	   must configure the value carried in this field.

	   Else the L bit is not set, this field can be empty or filled
	   by the recommended value.


   The Connection TLV may appear in Path or Resv message of co-routed
   bidirectional LSP.

4.3.  Global_ID TLV

   The Global_ID TLV is carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object with the
   following format:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |            Type (TBD)         |              Length           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           Global_ID                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                               Global_ID TLV

   This TLV can be used for co-routed or associated bidirectional LSP.
   For co-routed bidirectional LSP, it can appear in Path or Resv
   message.  As to associated bidirectional LSP, it can only appear in
   the Path message, and will be ignored in the Resv message.

5.  IANA Considerations

   One bit ("LSP identifier indication") needs to be allocated in the
   LSP Attributes Flags Registry.

   This document specifies two new TLVs to be carried in the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES objects in Path and Resv messages: the Connection TLV
   and Global_ID TLV.

   For the existing error code "Notify error" (value 25), one new Error
   value: "Unavailable tunnel number" needs to be assigned.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document adds a new flag to the Attributes Flags TLV and
   introduce two new TLVs in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES objects.  It does not
   introduce any new direct security issues, and the reader is referred
   to the security considerations expressed in [RFC2205] and [RFC5420].

   For a more comprehensive discussion on GMPLS security please see the
   Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS Networks [RFC5920].
