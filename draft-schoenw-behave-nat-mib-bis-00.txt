Internet-Draft          Extension of the NAT-MIB               July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The NAT-MIB [RFC4008] defines a standards-track model for configuring
   and monitoring Network Address Translators (NATs).  Recently, a
   number of new NAT variants have been proposed such as stateful NAT64
   [RFC6146], Carried Grade NAT (CGN), and Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].  A number of new MIB modules
   have been proposed to support these new variants of NATs.  This
   document provides an analysis and proposes to revise the NAT-MIB
   itself instead of creating additional MIB modules.


2.  Structure of the NAT-MIB

   The NAT-MIB [RFC4008] consists of tables carrying configuration
   information and tables indicating the currently active bindings and
   NAT sessions as shown in the figure below.

            +----------------------+        +-----------------+
      +-----| natInterfaceTable    |--------| natAddrMapTable |-+
      |     +----------------------+        +-----------------+ |-+
    +---+                                     +-----------------+ |
    | i |                                       +-----------------+
    | n |
    | t |   +----------------------+
    | e |---| natAddrBindTable     |-+
    | r |   +----------------------+ |-+
    | f |     +----------------------+ |
    | a |       +----------------------+
    | c |
    | e |   +----------------------+
    |   |---| natAddrPortBindTable |-+
    +---+   +----------------------+ |-+
      |       +----------------------+ |
      |         +----------------------+
      |
      |
      |     +----------------------+
      +-----| natSessionTable      |-+
            +----------------------+ |-+
              +----------------------+ |
                +----------------------+

   The NAT-MIB enables NAT functionality on a per interface basis.  As a
   consequence, the natInterfaceTable, is indexed by an ifIndex value.
   The table describing address pools, the natAddrMapTable, is indexed
   by an ifIndex value and a natAddrMapIndex.  While it is possible to
   have multiple address pools configured on a NAT function of an

   interface, NAT functions on different interfaces will have separate
   address pools.  The actual NAT bindings are reported in the
   natAddrBindTable (in case of pure address translation) indexed by an
   ifIndex value and the local private-realm network address and type or
   the natAddrPortBindTable (in case of address and port translation)
   indexed by an ifIndex value, the local private-realm network address
   and type and the local port number and protocol.  The natSessionTable
   provide statistics about NAT sessions.


3.  Extensions of the NAT-MIB

   As a consequence of the design of the NAT-MIB, the address pools
   configured in the natAddrMapTable are interface specific and cannot
   be shared between multiple interfaces.  In order to support NATs
   where the goal is to share public IPv4 addresses or address pools of
   public IPv4 addresses with multiple interfaces (multiple customers),
   an extension of the NAT-MIB is required allowing to configure address
   pools that can be shared between NAT interfaces.  One way of
   achieving this is to create a new natSharedAddrMapTable with a unique
   index (natSharedAddrMapIndex) that is referenced from
   natInterfaceTable entries.  If the reference is not provided, a
   suitable natAddrMapTable entry is expected to be used.

   The NAT64 MIB proposal [I-D.jpdionne-behave-nat64-mib] suggests to
   extend the natAddrMapTable so that a NAT64 prefix can be configured
   in case the default is not used.  It is not clear whether this
   functionality is necessary to add since the NAT-MIB already allows to
   configure address ranges.  (And it is unclear how the new proposed
   objects would interact with the existing objects).  Other proposed
   changes are clarifications of discard notifications, explainions of
   terminology differences, and the support of NAT sessions for ICMP.
   However, it is not clear whether adding the word 'icmp' to an
   enumeration is sufficient (nor is it clear what to do about DCCP and
   SCTP).

   The CGN MIB proposal [I-D.jpdionne-behave-cgn-mib] suggests to add
   objects to limit and/or throttle address and port allocations in
   order to address requirements detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements].  In addition, additional
   notifications are proposed to indicate address or port exhaustion.
   Finally, the authors suggest to add tables providing aggregated
   statistics about the usage of NAT address pools.

   The DS-Lite MIB proposal [I-D.fu-softwire-dslite-mib] suggests new
   objects to represent the relationship between the objects
   representing tunnels (as defined in the TUNNEL-MIB, [RFC4087]) and
   the NAT-MIB.  However, since a tunnel is identified by its unique



Schoenwaelder & Zhou     Expires January 5, 2012                [Page 4]

   ifIndex value and since the natInterfaceTable is also indexed by an
   ifIndex value, it is unclear why this is needed.  The proposal also
   suggests to add additional counters, e.g., tunnel specific counters
   for NAT bindings.  Architecturally, it seems to be more desirable to
   clearly separate the NAT functionality from the tunnel functionality.
   In particular, the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel architecturally ends at the
   tunnel interface and hence the NAT function only receives IPv4
   packets arriving via a tunnel interface.  However, it seems that
   gateway initiated tunnels that use IPv6-Flow-Label bits as a context
   identifier (CID) [I-D.ietf-softwire-gateway-init-ds-lite] require
   further discussion.


4.  Conclusions

   Looking at the structure of the current NAT-MIB and the proposed
   extensions, it seems the best way forward is to revise the NAT-MIB to
   add a minimal number of additional objects and any clarifications
   needed to cover NAT64, CGNs, and DS-Lite.  This seems to be a better
   approach than creating several independent extensions, in particular
   since some extensions seem to be generally applicable.

   In particular, the following items need to be worked on:

   o  Extend the NAT-MIB to support address pools shared between
      interface specific NAT instances.

   o  Extend the NAT-MIB to support protocols other than UDP and TCP.

   o  Add support to limit and/or throttle binding allocations.

   o  Clarify existing notifications (e.g., natPacketDiscard) and add
      any additional notifications that may be needed for binding limits
      / binding throttling.

   In addition, it will be necessary to look at protocols like the Port
   Control Protocol (PCP) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] that can create time-
   limited static entries.

   To help readers and implementers, it might be desirable to include
   (for example in an appendix) a description plus examples how the
   revised NAT-MIB can be used by NAT64 implementations, CGNs, and DS-
   Lite implementations.

   To support DS-Lite (and related technologies such as 6RD), a revision
   of the TUNNEL-MIB [RFC4087] may be needed as well or suitable tunnel
   type specific extensions.

   For configuration objects, it might be desirable to also produce a
   YANG data model (for use with the NETCONF protocol) that is
   consistent with the design of the revised NAT-MIB.
