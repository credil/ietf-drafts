           Experience of Designing Network Management System
            draft-teramoto-experience-network-management-00

Abstract

   This document describes our experiences from designing and
   implementing a large-scale local area network management system using
   mainly NETCONF.  We designed the data models for device
   configurations and implemented NETCONF client to centrally control
   multiple devices of various vendors.  The document provides insight
   on strong and weak points of current NETCONF approach.  The document
   also makes some recommendations about NETCONF and future network
   management protocols.

1.  Introduction

   This document discuss our experiences from designing and implementing
   a large-scale local area network management system.  In this
   document, the large-scale local area network is supposed to be
   composed by multiple network intelligent network devices of several
   vendors.

   We mainly used NETCONF[RFC6020][RFC6241][RFC6242] to get and edit
   configurations of network devices.  NETCONF, however, is a developing
   protocol on model layer, therefore there are several data model
   designs by vendors.  We designed the unified data models for device
   configurations to manage multiple devices of various vendors.
   Furthermore we implemented NETCONF client to control multiple devices
   asynchronously.

   This document evaluates the NETCONF protocol design and makes some
   recommendations about NETCONF and future network management protocols
   to support large-scale network management.


2.  Implementing NETCONF Client

2.1.  Transport protocol

   * The tune of transport layer is often required on large scale
   systems

   * NETCONF requires SSH implementation; however this protocol makes it
   difficult to create high-performance implementation

2.2.  Exchanging hello message

   * NETCONF does not define procedure to invoke errors on hello message
   exchange.

   * The error handling is different between vendors.

   * NETCONF should support hello fail message.

2.3.  lock and commit mechanism

   Lock mechanism of NETCONF is useful on control multiple devices
   safely.

3.  Designing Data Models

3.1.  YANG

   The approach of YANG is to express various configuration format;
   however it makes the issue of complexity of data model schema.

3.2.  RPC

   Some bad patterns in XML schema.
