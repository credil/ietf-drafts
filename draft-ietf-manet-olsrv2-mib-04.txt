                     draft-ietf-manet-olsrv2-mib-04

Abstract

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
   protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
   into state information, performance metrics, and notifications.  This
   additional state and performance information is useful to
   troubleshoot problems and performance issues of the routing protocol.
   Different levels of compliance allow implementers to use smaller
   subsets of all defined objects, allowing for this MIB module to be
   deployed on more constrained routers.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                     May 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
   protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
   into state information, performance metrics, and notifications.  In
   addition to configuration, this additional state and performance
   information is useful to troubleshoot problems and performance issues
   of the routing protocol.  Different levels of compliance allow
   implementers to use smaller subsets of all defined objects, allowing
   for this MIB module to be deployed on more constrained routers.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB module are defined using the mechanisms defined in
   the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This document
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in [RFC2578], [RFC2579], and [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) [OLSRv2]
   is a table driven, proactive routing protocol, i.e. it exchanges
   topology information with other routers in the network regularly.
   OLSRv2 is an optimization of the classical link state routing
   protocol.  Its key concept is that of MultiPoint Relays (MPRs).  Each
   router selects a set of its neighbor routers (which "cover" all of
   its symmetrically connected 2-hop neighbor routers) as MPRs.  MPRs
   are then used to achieve both flooding reduction and topology
   reduction.

   This document provides management and control capabilities of an
   OLSRv2 instance, allowing to monitor the state and performance of an
   OLSRV2 router, as well as to change settings of the deployment.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                     May 2012


   As OLSRv2 relies on the neighborhood information discovered by NHDP
   [RFC6130], the OLSRv2-MIB module is aligned with the NHDP-MIB
   [NHDP-MIB] module.  In particular, common indexes for router
   interfaces and discovered neighbors are used, as described in
   Section 5.2.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB module.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the OLSRv2 protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      OLSRv2 routing process on the router.

   o  Notification Objects - define triggers and associated notification
      messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined events
      on the managed router.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the OLSRv2-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following structure:

   o  olsrv2Objects - defines objects forming the basis for the OLSRv2-
      MIB module.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the OLSRv2 instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the OLSRv2 instance running on the router.

      *  Performance Group -defining objects which are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of
         OLSRv2 on the router and in the MANET.

   o  olsrv2Notifications - objects defining OLSRv2-MIB module
      notifications.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                     May 2012


   o  olsrv2Conformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB module.

5.1.  The Configuration Group

   The OLSRv2 router is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the OLSRv2-MIB
   module are found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt
   was made in developing the OLSRv2-MIB module to support all
   configuration objects defined in [OLSRv2].  For all of the
   configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of
   these parameters as defined in [OLSRv2] are followed.

5.2.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   [OLSRv2].  The OLSRv2-MIB module State Group tables were designed to
   contain the complete set of state information defined within the
   information bases in [OLSRv2].

   The OLSRv2-MIB module State Group tables are constructed as
   extensions to the corresponding tables within the State Group of the
   NHDP-MIB [NHDP-MIB] module.  Further, the State Group tables defined
   in this MIB module are aligned with the according tables in the NHDP-
   MIB [NHDP-MIB] module, as described in Section 6.2.

5.3.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   Frequent changes of sets or frequent recalculation of the routing set
   or the MPRs can have a negative influence on the performance of
   OLSRv2.  This MIB module defines several objects that can be polled
   in order to, e.g., calculate histories or monitor frequencies of
   changes.  This may help the network admministrator to determine
   unusual topology changes or other changes that affect stability and
   reliability of the MANET.  One such framework is specified in REPORT-
   MIB [REPORT-MIB].

5.4.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the OLSRv2-MIB module and their intended purpose or
   utility.

   The same mechanisms for improving the network performance by reducing
   the number of notifications apply as defined in Section 5.1 of
   [NHDP-MIB].  The Notifications Group contains Control, Objects and
   States, where the Control contains definitions of objects to control

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                     May 2012


   the frequency of notifications being sent.  The Objects define the
   supported notifications and the State is used to define additional
   information to be carried within the notifications.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB modules contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  Definitions imported from other MIB
   modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in
   conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are
   identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] module is defined as
   being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity
   as a whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the
   management entity and certain other system-wide data.  The OLSRv2-MIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the NHDP-MIB

   OLSRv2 depends on the neighborhood information that is discovered by
   [RFC6130].  In order access the Objects relating to discovered
   neighbors, the State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB [NHDP-MIB] module
   are aligned with this MIB module.  This is accomplished through the
   definition of two TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS in the NHDP-MIB module: the
   NeighborInterfaceId and the NeighborRouterId.  These object types are
   used to develop indexes into common NHDP-MIB module and routing
   protocol State Group tables.  These objects are locally significant
   but should be locally common to the NHDP-MIB module and the OLSRv2-
   MIB module implemented on a common networked router.  This will allow
   for improved cross referencing of information across the two MIB
   modules.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following OLSRv2-MIB module IMPORTS objects from NHDP-MIB
   [NHDP-MIB], SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF
   [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001], SMIng
   [RFC3781], and FLOAT-TC-MIB [RFC6340].

7.  Definitions

   This section contains the OLSRv2-MIB module defined by the
   specification.

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and
   notification of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2
   [OLSRv2].  OLSRv2 allows routers to acquire topological information
   of the routing domain by virtue of exchanging TC message, to
   calculate shortest paths to each destination router in the routing
   domain, to select relays for network-wide transmissions etc.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module



Herberg, et al.         Expires November 12, 2012              [Page 63]

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                     May 2012


   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  olsrv2TcInterval, olsrv2TcMinInterval - these writable objects
      control the rate at which TC messages are sent.  If set at too
      high a rate, this could represent a form of DOS attack by
      overloading interface resources.  If set low, OLSRv2 may not
      converge fast enough to provide accurate routes to all
      destinations in the routing domain.

   o  olsrv2TcHopLimit - defines the hop limit for TC messages.  If set
      too low, messages will not be forwarded beyond the defined scope,
      and thus routers further away from the message originator will not
      be able to construct appropriate topology graphs.

   o  olsrv2OHoldTime, olsrv2THoldTime, olsrv2AHoldTime,
      olsrv2RxHoldTime, olsrv2PHoldTime, olsrv2FHoldTime - define hold
      times for tuples of different Information Bases of OLSRv2.  If set
      too low, information will expire quickly, and may this harm a
      correct operation of the routing protocol.

   o  olsrv2WillFlooding and olsrv2WillRouting - define the willingness
      of this router to become MPR.  If this is set to WILL_NEVER (0),
      the managed router will not forward any TC messages, nor accept a
      selection to become MPR by neighboring routers.  If set to
      WILL_ALWAYS (15), the router will be preferred by neighbors during
      MPR selection, and may thus attract more traffic.

   o  olsrv2TpMaxJitter, olsrv2TtMaxJitter, olsrv2FMaxJitter - define
      jitter values for TC message transmission and forwarding.  If set
      too low, control traffic may get lost if the channel is lossy.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable - The contains information on the
      topology of the MANET, specifically the IP address of the routers
      in the MANET (as identified by
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr and



Herberg, et al.         Expires November 12, 2012              [Page 64]

      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr objects).  This information
      provides an adversary broad information on the members of the
      MANET, located within this single table.  This information can be
      use to expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without
      having to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr is the index into the
      table, and has a MAX-ACCESS of 'not-accessible'.  However, this
      information can be exposed using SNMP operations.

   MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of
   emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these
   applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of
   the communications network and to protect sensitive information
   related to its operation.  Therefore, when implementing these
   capabilities, the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for
   authentication and privacy is RECOMMENDED.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8, including
   full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
