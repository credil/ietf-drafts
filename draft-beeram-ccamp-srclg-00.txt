 1. Introduction 

    A Virtual TE Link (as defined in [RFC6001]) advertised into a Client 
    Network Domain represents a potentiality to setup an LSP in the 
    Server Network Domain to support the advertised TE link. The Virtual 
    TE Link gets advertised like any other TE link and follows the same 
    rules that are defined for the advertising, processing and use of 
    regular TE links [RFC4202]. However, "mutual exclusivity" is one 
    attribute that is specific to Virtual TE Links.  

    [DRAFT-MELG] discusses the different types of mutual exclusivity 
    (Static vs Dynamic) that come into play, explains the need to 
    advertise this information into the Client TE Domain and introduces 
    a new TE construct (MELG) to carry static mutual exclusivity 
    information.

 Internet-Draft                  SRcLG                      October 2013 
         

    This document is a companion document to [DRAFT-MELG]. It discusses 
    "Dynamic Mutual Exclusivity" in detail and introduces a new TE 
    construct (SRcLG) to carry dynamic mutual exclusivity information. 

 2. Dynamic Mutual Exclusivity 

    As discussed in [DRAFT-MELG], this type of mutual exclusivity exists 
    temporarily within a given network configuration. It comes into play 
    when two or more Virtual TE Links depend on the usage of the same 
    shareable underlying server network domain resource. Mutual 
    Exclusivity exists when the amount of the said server resource that 
    is available for sharing is limited temporarily; it ceases to exist 
    when sufficient amount of the resource is available for 
    accommodating all corresponding Virtual TE Links.

                     Figure 1a: Sample topology  

    Consider the network topology depicted in Figure 1a. This is a 
    typical packet optical transport deployment scenario where the WDM 
    layer network domain serves as a Server Network Domain providing 
    transport connectivity to the packet layer network Domain (Client 
    Network Domain).   

    Nodes R1, R2, R3 and R4 are IP routers that are connected to an 
    Optical WDM transport network. A, B, C, D, E and F are WDM nodes

    that constitute the Server Network Domain. The border nodes (A, B, E 
    and F) operate in both the server and client domains. Figure 1b 
    depicts how the Client Network Domain TE topology looks like when 
    there are no Client TE Links provisioned across the optical domain.

   Figure 2b: Client TE Database - Mutually Exclusive Virtual TE Links 

         
    In this particular example, all three potential paths traverse 
    through the WDM-Link {D-F}. Now assume that this link has only 2 
    lambda channels available. Also assume that any available lambda can 
    get picked for each of these 3 corresponding underlying server LSPs. 
    This means that only two out of the three Virtual TE Links can get 
    committed at the moment. This dynamic mutual exclusivity ceases to 
    exist when a third lambda channel becomes available on the WDM-link 
    {D-F}.  
         
    This document proposes the use of "Shared Resource Link Group 
    (SRcLG)" for catering to this scenario. 

        
 3. Shared Resource Link Group (SRcLG) 

    SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group - [RFC4202]) represents a set of links 
    that share a resource whose failure may affect all links in the set. 
    Since dynamic mutual exclusivity comes into play when the underlying 
    server resource is shareable, all corresponding Virtual TE-Links 
    would belong to the same SRLG. This document introduces the notion 
    of a "Shared Resource Link Group (SRcLG)", which is meaningful only 
    in the context of Virtual TE Links. SRcLG represents a set of 
    Virtual TE-links that depend on the usage of a shared server-layer

    resource that has a variable bandwidth capacity and as a result may 
    sometimes not be able to simultaneously accommodate all 
    corresponding Virtual TE-Links in the set. As is the case with 
    SRLGs, a given Virtual TE Link may belong to multiple SRcLGs.  
        
 3.1. Construct 

    In terms of the TE construct that gets advertised, an SRcLG is 
    nothing but an SRLG with some additional information to help 
    determine which and how many of the corresponding virtual TE Links 
    can get committed simultaneously. This additional information is the 
    per-priority available shared resource bandwidth associated with a 
    given SRLG. Since an SRcLG cannot exist without the presence of a 
    corresponding SRLG, the SRcLG is identified by the corresponding 32-
    bit SRLG-ID. In other words, the SRcLG-ID is the same as the 
    identifier of the SRLG it represents.

    The SRcLG information advertised into the Client TE Domain is an 
    unordered list of SRcLGs present in a given Virtual Topology. Unlike 
    the SRLG construct or the MELG construct, the SRcLG construct does 
    not get advertised per TE-Link. This is because the information 
    carried in this construct is quite dynamic in nature and advertising 
    it per TE-Link poses serious scaling concerns.

 3.2. Advertising Rules 

    As far as the advertisement of a Virtual TE-Link is concerned, there 
    is no perceived difference between SRLG and SRcLG. The 32-bit IDs of 
    all SRcLGs that a Virtual TE-Link belongs to are advertised via the 
    SRLG contruct. Additionally, all SRcLG information associated with a 
    given Virtual Topology is advertised into the Client TE Domain by 
    the provider of the Virtual Topology. It is the responsibility of 
    this provider to keep the bandwidth availability information for 
    each SRcLG current with timely updates. The draft envisions that one 
    or more server domain OSPF/ISIS TE speakers will be tasked to 
    provide these timely updates. This TE speaker may advertise all 
    SRcLG information (that it is responsible for) in the same OSPF-
    LSA/ISIS-LSP or advertise each SRcLG TLV separately - one in each 
    OSPF-LSA/ISIS-LSP. 
         
         
 3.3. Processing Rules 

    The intended consumer of this SRcLG information is the PCE in the 
    Client TE Domain. The Client PCE should take this advertised 
    information into account when performing path selection for services 
    over the Virtual Topology provided by the network domain. In 
    particular, this information should be used when deciding how many 
    Virtual TE links could be accomodated simultaneously on a given 
    SRcLG at a given priority level.
