Internet-Draft             Curve25519 for TLS             September 2013


1.  Introduction

   In [Curve25519], a new elliptic curve function for use in
   cryptographic applications was specified.  Curve25519 is a Diffie-
   Hellman function.  Curve25519 was designed with performance and
   security in mind.

   [RFC4492] defines the usage of elliptic curves for authentication and
   key agreement in TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, and these mechanisms are also
   applicable to TLS 1.2 [RFC5246].  The use of ECC curves for key
   exchange requires the definition and assignment of additional
   NamedCurve IDs.  This document specify that value for Curve25519.

   Curve25519 is not directly suitable for authentication, and thus not
   applicable for signing of e.g.  PKIX certificates.  See
   draft-josefsson-eddsa-ed25519 for a parallel effort.

2.  Curve25519 NamedCurve Type

   According to [RFC4492], the name space NamedCurve is used for the
   negotiation of elliptic curve groups for key exchange during a
   handshake starting a new TLS session.  This document add a new
   NamedCurve type for Curve25519 as follows.

           enum {
                curve25519(TBD1),
           } NamedCurve;

   The curve is suitable for use with DTLS [RFC6347].

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign numbers for Curve25519 listed in
   Section 2 to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters registry
   EC Named Curve [IANA-TLS] as follows.

               +-------+-------------+---------+-----------+
               | Value | Description | DTLS-OK | Reference |
               +-------+-------------+---------+-----------+
               |  TBD1 |  curve25519 |    Y    |  This doc |
               +-------+-------------+---------+-----------+
