<abstract>
<t>
   This document proposes a simple protocol, BMP, which can be used to
   monitor BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a more convenient
   interface for obtaining route views for research purpose than the
   screen-scraping approach in common use today.  The design
   goals are to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented, and
   minimally service-affecting.  BMP is not suitable for use as a
   routing protocol.

</t>

<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>
   Many researchers wish to have access to the contents of routers'
   BGP RIBs as well as a view of protocol updates that the router is
   receiving. This monitoring task cannot be realized by standard
   protocol mechanisms. At present, this data can only be obtained
   through screen-scraping.
</t>
<t>
   The BMP protocol provides access to the Adj-RIB-In of a peer on an
   ongoing basis and a periodic dump of certain statistics that the
   monitoring station can use for further analysis. The following
   are the messages provided by BMP.
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>
     Route Monitoring (RM): An initial dump of all routes
     received from a peer as well as an ongoing mechanism that
     sends the incremental routes advertised and withdrawn by a peer
     to the monitoring station.
</t>
<t>
     Peer Down Notification (PD): A message sent to indicate that a
     peering session has gone down with information indicating the
     reason for the session disconnect.
</t>
<t>
     Stats Reports (SR): This is an ongoing dump of statistics that
     can be used by the monitoring station as a high level indication
     of the activity going on in the router.
</t>
<t>
     Peer Up Notification (PU): A message sent to indicate that a 
     peering session has come up.  The message includes information
     regarding the data exchanged between the peers in their OPEN
     messages as well as information about the peering TCP session 
     itself.  In addition to being sent whenever a peer transitions
     to ESTABLISHED state, a Peer Up Notification is sent for
     each peer that is in ESTABLISHED state when the BMP session 
     itself comes up.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
   BMP operates over TCP.  All options are controlled by configuration
   on the monitored router.  No message is ever sent from the monitoring
   station to the monitored router.  The monitored router MAY take steps
   to prevent the monitoring station from sending data (e.g. by
   half-closing the TCP session or setting its window size to zero) or
   it MAY silently discard any data erroneously sent by the monitoring
   station.
</t>
<t>
   The monitoring station is configured to listen on a particular TCP
   port and the router is configured to establish an active connection
   to that port and to send messages on that TCP connection. There is
   no initialization or handshaking phase, messages are simply sent as
   soon as the connection is established.  If the router is unable to 
   connect to the monitoring station, it periodically retries the
   connection.  A suggested default retry period is 30 seconds.
</t>
<t>
   If the monitoring station intends to restart BMP processing, it
   simply drops the connection. The router then re-establishes the
   connection and resends the messages.  
</t>

<section title="Lifecycle of a BMP Session">
<t>
A BMP session begins when a router running BMP successfully opens a TCP
session (the "BMP session") to the monitoring station it is configured
to talk to. It MAY first send an Initiation message.  It subsequently
sends a Peer Up message over the BMP session for each of its BGP peers
which are in Established state.  It follows by sending the contents of
its Adj-RIBs-In (or Loc-RIB, see <xref
target="route_monitoring"></xref>) encapsulated in Route Monitoring
messages.  Once it has sent all the routes for a given peer, it sends an
End-of-RIB message for that peer; when End-of-RIB has been sent for each
peer, the initial table dump has completed.  (A monitoring station that
wishes only to gather a table dump could close the connection once it
has gathered an End-of-RIB or Peer Down message corresponding to each
Peer Up message.)
</t>
<t>
Following the initial table dump, the router sends incremental updates
encapsulated in Route Monitoring messages.  It MAY periodically send
Stats Reports or even new Initiation messages, according to
configuration. If any new BGP peers become Established, corresponding
Peer Up messages are sent.  If any BGP peers for which Peer Up messages
were sent transition out of the Established state, corresponding Peer
Down messages are sent.
</t>
<t>
A BMP session ends when the TCP session that carries it is closed for 
any reason.

   complex TLV-type "Stat Data" (for example, one which can carry
   prefix specific data). SR messages are optional. However if an SR
   message is transmitted, this specification requires at least one statistic
   to be carried in it.

<section title="Route Monitoring" anchor="route_monitoring">
<t>
   After the BMP session is up, Route Monitoring messages are used to
   provide a snapshot of the Adj-RIB-In of a particular peer.  This
   is done by sending all routes stored in the Adj-RIB-In of that peer
   using standard BGP Update messages.  There is no requirement on the
   ordering of messages in the peer dump.  When the initial peer dump
   is completed, this MUST be indicated by sending an End-of-RIB 
   marker (as specified in Section 2 of <xref target="RFC4724"></xref>, 
   plus the BMP encapsulation header).
</t>
<t>
   Depending on the implementation or configuration, it may only be
   possible to send the Loc-RIB (post-policy routes) instead of the
   Adj-RIB-In.  This is because it is possible that a BGP
   implementation may not store, for example, routes which have been
   filtered out by policy.  If this is the case, the implementation
   may send the Loc-RIB path that pertains to a particular peer in the
   route monitor message.  Such paths MUST have the L flag set in the
   BMP header (see <xref target="bmp_message_format"></xref>).
</t>
<t>
   If the implementation is able to provide information about when
   routes were received, it MAY provide such information in the BMP
   timestamp field.  Otherwise, the BMP timestamp field MUST be set to
   zero, indicating that time is not available.
</t>
<t>
   AS Numbers in the BMP UPDATE message MUST be sent as 4-octet
   quantities, as described in <xref target="RFC4893"></xref>.  This
   affects the AS_PATH and AGGREGATOR path attributes.  AS4_PATH or
   AS4_AGGREGATOR path attributes MUST NOT be sent in a BMP UPDATE
   message, as it makes no sense to do so.
</t>
<t>
   Ongoing monitoring is accomplished by propagating route 
   changes in BGP UPDATE PDUs and forwarding those PDUs to the 
   monitoring station, again using RM messages.  When a change 
   occurs to a route, such as an attribute change, the router 
   must update the monitor with the new attribute. When a route 
   is withdrawn by a peer, a corresponding withdraw is sent to 
   the monitor.  Multiple changed routes MAY be grouped into a 
   single BGP UPDATE PDU when feasible, exactly as in the 
   standard BGP protocol.
</t>
<t>
   It's important to note that RM messages are not real time replicated
   messages received from a peer.  While the router should attempt to
   generate updates as soon as they are received there is a finite
   time that could elapse between reception of an update and the 
   generation an RM message and its transmission 
   to the monitoring station.  If there are state
   changes in the interim for that prefix, it is acceptable that the
   router generate the final state of that prefix to the monitoring
   station. The actual PDU generated and transmitted to the station might also differ
   from the exact PDU received from the peer, for example due to 
   differences between how different implementations format path attributes.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Stat Reports" anchor="stat_reports">
<t>
   As outlined above, SR messages are used to monitor specific events
   and counters on the monitored router. One type of monitoring could
   be to find out if there are an undue number of route advertisements
   and withdraws happening (churn) on the monitored router. Another
   metric is to evaluate the number of looped AS-Paths on the router.
</t>
<t>
   While this document proposes a small set of counters to begin with,
   the authors envision this list may grow in the future with new
   applications that require BMP style monitoring.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Other Considerations" anchor="other_considerations">
<t>
   Some routers may support multiple instances of the BGP protocol,
   for example as "logical routers" or through some other facility.
   The BMP protocol relates to a single instance of BGP; thus, if
   a router supports multiple BGP instances it should also support
   multiple BMP instances (one per BMP instance).
</t>
</section>

<section title="Using BMP" anchor="using_bmp">
<t>
   Once the BMP session is established route monitoring starts
   dumping the current snapshot as well as incremental changes
   simultaneously.  
</t>
<t>
   It is fine to have these operations occur concurrently. If the
   initial dump visits a route and subsequently a withdraw is
   received, this will be forwarded to the monitoring station which
   would have to correlate and reflect the deletion of that route in
   its internal state.  This is an operation a monitoring station
   would need to support regardless.
</t>
<t>
   If the router receives a withdraw for a prefix even before the peer
   dump procedure visits that prefix, then the router would clean up
   that route from its internal state and will not forward it to the
   monitoring station. In this case, the monitoring station may
   receive a bogus withdraw which it can safely ignore.
