<!-- ABSTRACT
-->				
		<abstract>
			<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
   provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA
   when the user is alerted.  This is done using the Alert-Info header
   field.  However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a
   specific network resource with specific rendering properties.
   There is currently no support for standard identifiers for
   describing the semantics of the alerting situation or the
   characteristics of the alerting signal, without being tied to a
   particular rendering.  To overcome these limitations and support new
   applications, a new family of URNs for use in SIP Alert-Info header
   fields (and situations with similar requirements) is defined in
   this specification.

<!-- INTRODUCTION
-->			
		<section title="Introduction">
			<section title="Motivation">
				<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> includes a
        means to suggest to a user agent
        (UA) a particular ringback tone or ring tone to be used during session
        establishment. In <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> this is done by
        including a URI in the Alert-Info header field, that specifies the
        tone. The URI is most commonly the HTTP URL to the audio file. On the
        receipt of the Alert-Info header field the user agent may fetch the
        referenced ringback tone or ring tone and play it to the user.</t>
				<t>This mechanism hinders interoperability when there is no common
        understanding of the meaning of the referenced tone, which might be
        country- or vendor-specific. It can lead to problems for the user
        trying to interpret the tone and for the UA wanting to substitute its
        own tone (e.g., in accordance with user preferences) or provide an
        alternative alerting mode (e.g., for hearing-impaired users). If
        caller and callee are from different countries, the understanding of
        the tones may vary significantly. Hearing impaired users may not sense
        the specific tone if it is provided as an audio file. The tone per se
        is also not useful for automata.</t>
				<t>There are currently interoperability issues around the use of the
        Alert-Info header field when not using an external ring file. For
        example, consider the PBX special ring tone for an external (to the
        PBX) caller. Different vendors use different approaches such as:
        Alert-Info: &lt;file://ring.pcm&gt;;alert=normal where ring.pcm is a
        dummy file or: Alert-Info: &lt;file://normal.ring.pcm&gt; or:
        Alert-Info: &lt;sip:normal-ringtone@example.com&gt;. As a result,
        Alert-Info currently only works when the same vendor provides PBX
        and UA, as only then if the same "fake" proprietary URI convention
        used.</t>
				<t>Another limitation of the current solution is that the referenced
        tones are tied to particular rendering. It is not possible to provide
        semantic indications or names for rendering characteristics that
        signals the intent and allows the recipient UA to decide how to render
        the received information in an appropriate way.</t>
				<t>To solve the described issues, this specification defines the new
        URN namespace "alert" for the Alert-Info header field that allows for
        programmatic user interface adaptation and for conversion of
        equivalent alerting tones in the Public Switched Telephone Network
        (PSTN) when the client is a gateway. The work to standardize an
        "alert" URN will increase SIP interoperability for this header
        field by replacing proprietary conventions used today.</t>
				<t>Using the "alert" namespace provides syntax for several different
        application spaces, e. g.:</t>
        <t><list style="symbols">
						<t>Names for service indications, such as call waiting or
            automatic callback, not tied to any particular rendering.</t>
						<t>Names for common ring tones generated by PBX phones for cases
            such as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback
            tone after a transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer,
            etc.</t>
						<t>Names for country-specific ringback tones.</t>
						<t>Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
            audio. They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.</t>
					</list></t>
				<t>Some advantages of a URN rather than a URL of a downloadable
        resource:</t>
				<t><list style="symbols">
						<t>Do not need to download it or deal with security issues
            associated with dereferencing.</t>
						<t>No formatting or compatibility issues.</t>
						<t>No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
            undesirable.</t>
						<t>The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at
            whatever quality level is appropriate, because it is specified "by
            name" rather than "by value".</t>
						<t>It is easier to make policy decisions about whether to use it
            or not.</t>
						<t>It facilitates translation for the hearing impaired.</t>
					</list></t>
				<t>	 The downside is that if the recipient does not understand
        the URN then it will only be able to render a default ringback tone or
        ring tone.</t>
				<t>This document creates a new URN namespace and registry for alert
        indications and registers some initial values.</t>

			<section title="Alert-Info Header Field Usage Change">
				<t>This specification changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
        field defined in the <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> by additionally
        allowing its use in all provisional responses to INVITE (except the
        100 response).</t>
				<t>
Previously, the Alert-Info header field was only permitted in 180
   (Ringing) responses.  But in telephony, other situations indicated
   by SIP provisional responses, such as 181 (Call Is Being Forwarded)
   and 182 (Call Is Being Queued), are often indicated by tones.
   Extending the applicability of Alert-Info allows the telephony
   practice to be implemented in SIP.</t>
				<t>In practice, this specification extends Alert-Info in that it will
        cause the use of a new class of URIs and the use of multiple URIs.
        Backward compatibility issues are not expected, as devices that do not
        understand an "alert" URN should ignore it, and devices should not
        malfunction upon receiving multiple Alert-Info alert-params (which was
        syntactically permitted before, but rarely used).</t>
			</section>
			
			
			<section title="Terminology">
				<t>This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
        involved in the use of alerting indications in SIP. A "specifier"
        sends an "alerting indication" (one or more URNs in an Alert-Info
        header field) to a "renderer" which then "renders" a "signal" or "rendering"
        based on the indication to a human user. A "category" is a
        characteristic whose "values" can be used to classify indications.</t>
				<t>This specification uses the terms "ring tone" and "ringback tone".
        A "ring tone" or "calling signal" (terminology used in 
      <xref target="E182"></xref>) is a signal generated by the callee's
        end device, advising the callee about an incoming call. A "ringback
        tone" or "ringing tone" (terminology used in <xref target="E182"></xref>)
         is a signal advising the caller that a
        connection has been made and that a ring tone is being rendered to the
        callee.</t>

<!-- REQUIREMENTS
-->					
		</section>
		<section title="Requirements">
			<t>This section discusses the requirements for an alerting indication to
      transport the semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics
      of the rendering.</t>
			<t>REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) and proxies to
      provide in the Alert-Info header field an alerting indication which
      describes the semantics of the signaling situation or the
      characteristics of the rendering and allows the recipient to decide how
      to render the received information to the user.</t>
			<t>REQ-2: The mechanism will allow the alerting indication to be
      specified "by name" rather than "by value", to enable local policy
      decisions whether to use it or not.</t>
			<t>REQ-3: The mechanism will enable alerting indications to represent a
      wide variety of signals, which have many largely-orthogonal
      characteristics.</t>
			<t>REQ-4: has been deleted. To avoid confusion, the number will not be
      reused.</t>
			<t>REQ-5: The mechanism will enable the set of alerting indications to
      be able to support extensibility by a wide variety of organizations that
      are not coordinated with each other. Extensions will be able to:
      
	  <list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="- add further values to any existing category "/>
					<t hangText="- add further categories that are orthogonal to existing categories "/>
					<t hangText="- semantically subdivide the meaning provided by any existing indication"/>
				</list>
			</t>	
			<t>
        REQ-6: The mechanism will be flexible, so new alerting
      indications can be defined in the future, when SIP-applications evolve.
      E. g. "alert" URNs could identify specific media by name, such as
      "Beethoven's Fifth", and the end device could render some small part of
      it as a ring tone.</t>
			<t>REQ-7: The mechanism will provide only an indication capability, not
      a negotiation capability. </t>
			<t>REQ-8:  The mechanism will not require an alerting
      indication to depend on context provided by a previous alerting
      indication in either direction.</t>
			<t>REQ-9: The mechanism will allow transmission in the Alert-Info header
      field of SIP INVITE requests and provisional 1xx responses excepting the
      100 responses.</t>
			<t>REQ-10: The mechanism will be able to accommodate renderers that are
      customized with a limited or uncommon set of signals they can render and
      renderers that are provided with a set of signals that have uncommon
      semantics. (The canonical example is a UA for the hearing-impaired,
      customized with an uncomon set of signals, video or text instead of
      audio. By REQ-7, the renderer has no way of transmitting this fact to
      the specifier.)</t>
			<t>REQ-11: The mechanism will allow an alerting indication to reliably
      carry all extensions if the specifier and the renderer have designs that
      are properly coordinated.</t>
			<t>REQ-12: The mechanism will allow a renderer to select a tone that
      approximates to that intended by the specifier if the renderer is unable
      to provide the precise tone indicated.</t>
			<t>REQ-13: The mechanism will support alerting indications relating to
      services such as call waiting, forward, transfer-recall, auto-callback
      and hold-recall.</t>
			<t>REQ-14: The mechanism will allow rendering common PBX ring tone
      types.</t>
			<t>REQ-15: The mechanism will allow rendering specific country ringback
      tones.</t>
			<t>REQ-16: The mechanism will allow rendering tones for emergency
      alerts. (Use cases and values definition are not subject of this
      specification.)</t>
			<t>REQ-17: The mechanism will allow rendering using other means than
      tones, e.g. text or images.</t>
			<t>REQ-18: The mechanism will allow TDM gateways to map ring/ringback
      tones from legacy protocols to SIP at the edge of a network, e.g.
      national ring tones as defined in TIA/EIA-41-D and 3GPP2 A.S0014. (Use
      cases and values definition are not subject of this specification.)</t>
			<t>REQ-19: The mechanism will ensure that if an UA receives "alert"
      URNs or portions of an "alert" URN it does not understand, it can
      ignore them.</t>
			<t>REQ-20 The mechanism will allow storage of the actual encoding of
      the rendering locally rather than fetching it.</t>
			<t>REQ-21: The mechanism must provide a simple way to combine two
      alerting indications to produce an alerting indication that requests a
      combination of the intentions of the two alerting indications, where any
      contradictions or conflicts between the two alerting indications are
      resolved in favor of the intention of the first alerting indication.</t>

<!-- USE CASES
-->		
		<section anchor="UseCases" title="Use Cases">
			<t>This section describes some use cases for which the "alert" URN
      mechanism is needed today.</t>
			<section anchor="PBX_Tones" title="PBX Ring Tones">
				<t>This section defines some commonly encountered ring tones on PBX or
        business phones. They are as follows:</t>
				<section title="normal">
					<t>This tone indicates that the default or normal ring tone should
          be rendered. This is essentially a no-operation "alert" URN and
          should be treated by the UA as if no "alert" URN is present. This
          is most useful when Alert-Info header field parameters are being
          used. For example, in <xref target="I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances"></xref>, an Alert-Info
          header field needs to be present containing the "appearance"
          parameter, but no special ring tone needs to be specified.</t>
          <t>[Note to RFC Editor:  Please update the information for this
   reference and change its tag from
   "I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances" to the appropriate RFC number.]</t>

          
				</section>
				<section title="external">
					<t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is external to the
          enterprise or PBX system. This could be a call from the PSTN or from
          a SIP trunk.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="internal">
					<t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is internal to the
          enterprise or PBX system. The call could have been originated from
          another user on this PBX or on another PBX within the
          enterprise.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="priority">
					<t>A PBX tone needs to indicate that a priority level alert should
          be applied for the type of alerting specified (e.g. internal
          alerting).</t>
				</section>
				<section title="short ">
					<t>In this case the alerting type specified (e.g. internal alerting)
          should be rendered shorter than normal. In contact centers, this is
          sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone".</t>
				</section>
				<section anchor="DelayDescription" title="delayed">
					<t>In this case the alerting type specified should be rendered after
          a short delay. In some bridged line/shared line appearance
          implementations, this is used so that the bridged line does not ring
          at exactly the same time as the main line, but is delayed a few
          seconds.</t>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section anchor="ServiceTones" title="Service Tones">
				<t>These tones are used to indicate specific PBX and public network
        telephony services.</t>
				<section title="call-waiting">
					<t>The Call Waiting Service <xref target="TS24.615"></xref> permits
          a callee to be notified of an incoming call while the callee is
          engaged in an active or held call. Subsequently, the callee can
          either accept, reject, or ignore the incoming call. There is an
          interest on the caller side to be informed about the call waiting
          situation on the callee side. Having this information the caller can
          decide whether to continue waiting for callee to pickup or better to
          call some time later when it is estimated that the callee could have
          finished the ongoing conversation. To provide this information, the
          callee's UAS ( or proxy) aware of the call waiting condition can add
          the call-waiting indication to the Alert-Info header field in the
          180 Ringing response. As call-waiting information may be subject to
          the callee's privacy concerns, the exposure of this information
          shall be done only if explicitly required by the callee.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="forward">
					<t>This feature is used in a 180 Ringing response when a call
          forwarding feature has been initiated on an INVITE. Many PBX system
          implement a forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate
          this. Note that a 181 response can be used in place of this URN.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="transfer-recall">
					<t>This feature is used when a blind transfer 
       <xref target="RFC5589"></xref> has been performed by a server on behalf of
          the transferor and fails. Instead of failing the call, the server
          calls back the transferor, giving them another chance to transfer or
          otherwise deal with the call. This service tone is used to
          distinguish this INVITE from any other normal incoming call.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="auto-callback">
					<t>This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to
          implement an automatic callback service 
     <xref target="RFC6910"></xref>. When the user is available,
          the server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
          distinguish this from any other normal incoming call.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="hold-recall">
					<t>This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer
          on behalf of an endpoint. After a certain period of time of being on
          hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
          retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call. This service
          tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
          call.</t>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section anchor="CountryTones" 
           title="Country-specific ringback tone indications for the public telephone network">
				<t>In the PSTN, different tones are used in different countries. End
        users are accustomed to hear the callee's country ringback tone and
        would like to have this feature for SIP.</t>

			<t hangText="Namespace considerations:">			
 This specification defines a URN namespace "alert" for URNs
      representing signals or renderings which are presented to users
      to inform them of events and actions.  The initial usage is to
      specify ring tones and ringback tones when dialogs are
      established in SIP, but they can also be used for other
      commuication-initiation protocols (e.g., H.323), and more
      generally, in any situation (e.g., web pages or endpoint device
      software configurations) to describe how a user should be
      signaled.</t>
<t></t>
<t>  An "alert" URN does not describe a complete signal, but rather
      describes a particular characteristic of the event it is
      signaling or a feature of the signal to be presented.  The
      complete specification of the signal is a sequence of "alert"
      URNs specifying the desired characteristics/significance of the
      signal in priority order, with the most important aspects specified by
      the earlier URNs.  This allows the sender of a sequence of URNs
      to compose very detailed specifications from a restricted set of
      URNs, and to clearly specify which aspects of the specification
      it considers most important.
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      The initial scope of usage is in the SIP Alert-Info header field, in
      initial INVITE requests (to indicate how the called user should
      be alerted regarding the call) and non-100 provisional (1xx)
      responses to those INVITE requests (to indicate the ringback,
      how the calling user should be alerted regarding the progress of
      the call).
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      In order to assure widespread adoption of these URNs for
      indicating ring tones and ringback tones, the scheme must allow
      replication of the current diversity of these tones.  Currently,
      these tones vary between the PSTNs of different nations and
      between equipment supplied by different vendors.  Thus, the
      scheme must accommodate national variations and proprietary
      extensions in a way that minimizes the information that is lost
      during interoperation between systems that follow different
      national variations or that are supplied by different vendors.
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      The scheme allows definition of private extension URNs that refine
      and extend the information provided by standard URNs.  Private
      extension URNs can also refine and extend the information
      provided by other private extension URNs.  Private extensions can also
      define entirely new categories of information about calls.  We
      expect these extensions to be used extensively when existing PBX
      products are converted to support SIP operation.
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      The device that receives an Alert-Info header field containing a
      sequence of "alert" URNs provides to the user a rendering 
      that represents the semantic content of the URNs.  The device is
      given great leeway in choosing the rendering, but it is
      constrained by rules that maximize interoperability
      between systems that support different sets of private
      extensions.  In particular, earlier URNs in the sequence
      have priority of expression over later URNs in the sequence,
      and URNs that are not usable in their entirety (because they
      contain unknown extensions or are incompatible with previous
      URNs) are successively truncated in attempt to construct a URN
      that retains some information and is renderable in the context.
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      Due to the practical importance of private extensions for the
      adoption of URNs for alerting calls and the very specific rules
      for private extensions and the corresponding processing rules
      that allow quality interoperation in the face of private
      extensions, the requirements of the "alert" URN schems cannot be
      met by a fixed enumeration of URNs and corresponding meanings.
      In particular, the existing namespace "urn:ietf:params" does not
      suffice (unless the private extension apparatus is applied to
      that namespace).
</t>
<t></t>

<t></t>
<t>
      There do not appear to be other URN namespaces that
      uniquely identify the semantic of a signal or rendering feature.
      Unlike most other currently registered URN namespaces, the
      "alert" URN does not identify documents and protocol objects
      (e.g., [RFC3044], [RFC3120], [RFC3187], [RFC3188], [RFC4179],
      [RFC4195], [RFC4198]), types of telecommunications equipment
      [RFC4152], people or organizations [RFC3043].
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      The &lt;alert-URN&gt;s are hierarchical identifiers.  An &lt;alert-URN&gt;
      asserts some fact or feature of the offered SIP dialog, or some
      fact or feature of how it should be presented to a user, or of
      how it is being presented to a user.  Removing an &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;
      from the end of an &lt;alert-URN&gt; (which has more than one
      &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s) creates a shorter &lt;alert-URN&gt; with a less specific
      meaning; the set of dialogs to which the longer &lt;alert-URN&gt;
      applies is necessarily a subset of the set of dialogs to which
      the shorter &lt;alert-URN&gt; applies.  (If the starting &lt;alert-URN&gt;
      contains only one &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;, and thus the &lt;alert-ind-part&gt; cannot
      be removed to make a shorter &lt;alert-URN&gt;, we can consider the
      set of dialogs to which the &lt;alert-URN&gt; applies to be a subset
      of the set of all dialogs.)
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      The specific criteria defining the subset to which the longer
      &lt;alert-URN&gt; applies, within the larger set of dialogs, is
      considered to be the meaning of the final &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;.  This
      meaning is relative to and depends upon the preceding
      &lt;alert-category&gt; and &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s (if any).  The meanings of
      two &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s that are textually the same but are preceded
      by different &lt;alert-category&gt;s or &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s have no
      necessary connection.  (An &lt;alert-category&gt; considered alone
      has no meaning.)
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      The organization owning the &lt;provider&gt; within a &lt;private-name&gt;
      specifies the meaning of that &lt;private-name&gt; when it is used as
      an &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;.  (The organization owning a &lt;provider&gt; is
      determined by the rules in  <xref target="PrivateExtensionRules"></xref>.)
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      The organization owning the &lt;provider&gt; within a &lt;private-name&gt; (in
      either an &lt;alert-category&gt; or an &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;) specifies the
      meaning of each &lt;alert-ind-part&gt; which is an &lt;alert-label&gt; that
      follows that &lt;private-name&gt; and that precedes the next
      &lt;alert-ind-part&gt; which is a &lt;private-name&gt; (if any).
</t>
<t></t>
<t>
      The meaning of all other &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s (i.e., those that are not
      &lt;private-name&gt;s and do not follow a &lt;private-name&gt;) is defined
      by standardization.
</t>
<t></t>
<t hangText="Community considerations:">The "alert" URNs are relevant to a large
      cross-section of Internet users, namely those that initiate and
      receive communication connections via the Session Initiation
      Protocol.  These users include both technical and non-technical
      users, on a variety of devices and with a variety of perception
      capabilities.  The "alert" URNs will allow Internet users to
      receive more information about offered calls and enable them to
      better make decisions about accepting an offered call, and to get
      better feedback on the progress of a call they have made.</t>
<t></t>
      <t> User interfaces for perception-impaired users can better render
      the ring and ringback tones based on the "alert" URNs because
      the URNs provide more detailed information regarding the
      intention of communications than is provided by current SIP
      mechanisms.</t>
      <t></t>

<t hangText="Process of identifier assignment:"> </t><t> 

      Assignment of standardized "alert" URNs is by insertion into the
      IANA registry described in  <xref target="IANA"></xref>.  This
      process defines the meanings of &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s that have
      standardized meanings, as described in "Namespace Considerations".
</t>
<t></t>
<t> 
      Private extensions are "alert" URNs that include
      &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s that are &lt;private-name&gt;s and &lt;alert-label&gt;s
      that appear after a &lt;private-name&gt;s (either as an
      &lt;alert-category&gt; or an &lt;alert-indication&gt;).  If such an
      &lt;alert-ind-part&gt; is a &lt;private-name&gt;, its meaning is defined by
      the organization that owns the &lt;provider&gt; that appears in the
      &lt;private-name&gt;.  If the &lt;alert-ind-part&gt; is an &lt;alert-label&gt;,
      its meaning is defined by the organization that owns the &lt;provider&gt;
      that appears in the closest  private-name> preceeding the
      &lt;alert-label&gt;.  The rules for determining the organization that owns a
      &lt;provider&gt; are given in <xref target="PrivateExtensionRules"></xref>.

	<t></t>		
					<t hangText="Identifier uniqueness and persistence considerations:"> 
An "alert" URN identifies a semantic feature of a
      call or a sensory feature of how the call alerting should be a 
      rendered at the caller's or callee's end device.</t>
<t></t>      
      <t> 
      For standardized &lt;alert-ind-parts&gt; in URNs, uniqueness and
      persistence of their meanings is guaranteed by the fact that
      they are registered with IANA in accordance with the procedures
      of  <xref target="IANA"></xref>; the feature identified by a
      particular "alert" URN is distinct from the feature identified
      by any other standardized "alert" URN.
</t>
<t></t>
<t> 
      Assuring uniqueness and persistence of the meanings of private
      extensions is delegated to the organizations  that define private
      extension &lt;alert-ind-parts&gt;.  The organization responsible for a
      particular &lt;alert-ind-part&gt; in a particular "alert" URN is the
      owner of a syntactically-determined &lt;provider&gt; part within the
      URN.  Once an organization obtains ownership of a particular
      &lt;provider&gt;, it retains ownership of it for all time, as
      described in <xref target="PrivateExtensionRules"></xref>.</t>
      
 <t></t>
<t>    An organization SHOULD use only one &lt;provider&gt; value for all of the
   &lt;private-name&gt;s it defines.

					<t hangText="Process for identifier resolution:">
The process of identifier resolution is the process by which a
      rendering device chooses a rendering to represent a sequence of
      "alert" URNs.  The device is allowed great leeway in making this
      choice, but the process must obey the rules of 
<xref target="PriorityRules"></xref>.  The device is expected to provide renderings that
      users associate with the meanings assigned to the URNs within
      their cultural context.  A non-normative example resolution
      algorithm is given in  <xref target="AlgorithmDescription"></xref>.</t>
 <t></t>     
					<t hangText="Rules for lexical equivalence:"> "alert" URNs are compared
      according to case-insensitive string equality, except that

        defaults in <xref target="InterpretingProvider"></xref>,
      viz., an omitted &lt;date&gt; defaults to "2013-01-01", an omitted
      &lt;CC&gt; defaults to "20", and an omitted &lt;MM&gt; or &lt;DD&gt; defaults to
      "01".</t>
      <t></t>
					<t hangText="Conformance with URN syntax:">All "alert" URNs must conform to the
      BNF in the 'Declaration of syntactic structure', which is a
      subset of the generic URN syntax.  Note that "internationalized"
      DNS labels may appear in &lt;provider-id&gt;s, in which case they must
      appear as A-labels, that is, as transformed by Punycode.
      &lt;alert-label&gt;s, that is, components that are not DNS labels, are
      constrained to be Non Reserved LDH-labels, that is, "ordinary
      ASCII labels".  Future standardization may allow &lt;alert-label&gt;s
      that are A-labels, and so interpreters of "alert" URNs must
      operate correctly when given such URNs as input.

					<t hangText="Validation mechanism:"> 
An "alert" URN containing no private extensions can be validated
      based on the IANA registry of standardized "alert" URNs.

      obtaining information regarding the private extensions defined
      by the organization that owns the &lt;provider&gt; in the relevant

<!-- EXTENSION RULES
-->		
		
		<section anchor="ExtensionRules" title="Extension Rules">
			<section anchor="GeneralExtensionRules" title="General Extension Rules">
				<t>  The set of  "alert" URNs is extensible.  An extension "at the top
   level" creates an new &lt;alert-category&gt;  (which represents a new
   alerting characteristic), an extension "at the second level"
   creates a new &lt;alert-indication&gt;  value for an existing
   &lt;alert-category&gt; , an extension "at the third level" creates a
   subdivision of an existing &lt;alert-indication&gt;  (that has one
   &lt;alert-ind-part&gt; ), etc.  URNs allow (in principle) indefinite
   subdivision of existing &lt;alert-indication&gt;  values, although most of
   the standard "alert" URNs have only one level of subdivision and
   a few have two levels of subdivision.</t>
				<t>Designers of extensions should take care to derive the new URN from
   the most specific base URN which has the correct meaning; a new URN
   should have no semantic overlap with any sibling URN, i.e., there
   can be no calls to which both URNs could apply.
      </t>
				<t>The process for defining new standard "alert" URNs is described in <xref target="Registry"></xref>. 
     Currently, all such definitions require Standards
   Action. The process for defining new "alert" URNs via the private
   extension mechanism is described in 
      <xref target="PrivateExtensionRules"></xref> is Standards Action.</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="PrivateExtensionRules" title="Private Extension Rules">
				
<t>The "&lt;private-name&gt;" syntax is used to create private extensions,
   extensions that are not registered with IANA. The "&lt;private-name&gt;" has the form
    of an "&lt;alert-label&gt;" (which has the same  syntax as an ordinary ASCII DNS label), 
    followed by "@" and then a &lt;provider> that
   designates the organization defining the extension.  A private
   extension URN is created by using a &lt;private-name&gt; as either an
   &lt;alert-category&gt; or an &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;.</t>

<t> If the &lt;private-name&gt; is used as an &lt;alert-category&gt;, the
   characteristic of the alerting signal that the &lt;alert-category&gt;
   describes is defined by the organization.  If the &lt;private-name&gt; is
   used as the first &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;, the organization defines an
   alternative value for the standardized &lt;alert-category&gt; of the URN.  If the
   &lt;private-name&gt; is used as the second or later &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;, the
   organization defines the meaning of the URN as a subset of the
   meaning of the shorter URN resulting when the &lt;private-name&gt; (and
   any subsequent &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s) are removed.</t>

<t>Within a URN, all &lt;alert-label> components that follow a
   &lt;private-name&gt; but are before any following &lt;private-name&gt;s are
   additional private extensions whose meaning is defined by the
   organization defining the &lt;private-name&gt;.</t>

   <t>A URN that contains a private extension can be further subdivided
   by the private extension of a different organization:  the second
   organization adds a &lt;private-name&gt; component containing a
   &lt;provider&gt; that is valid for the second organization.</t>

<t>The meaning of a &lt;private-name&gt; or an &lt;alert-label&gt; that is defined
   privately (because of a preceding &lt;private-name&gt;) is only fixed within
   the context provided by the sequence of preceding &lt;alert-name&gt;s; these components
   have no meaning in isolation and there is no necessary relationship
   between the meaning of textually identical &lt;alert-name&gt;s that are preceded
     by different sequences of &lt;alert-name&gt;s.
.</t>

  <t> Creating private extension "alert" URNs is not a standards action
   and they are not registered with IANA.</t>

<t>Adding new categories and adding &lt;alert-indication&gt; values 
        via the "private extension" mechanism is not a standards action.</t>

<t>  Once an organization obtains the right to use a particular
   &lt;provider&gt; for constructing &lt;private-name&gt;s, it will retain that
   right forever, unless it transfers that right to another
   organization.  The organization defining a private extension is
   responsible for ensuring persistence of the meaning of the private
   extension, and for ensuring that the private extension does not
   duplicate any standard URN or any private extension that the
   organization is aware of.  (In either case, the organization SHOULD
   use the existing URN for its purposes.)
    </t>        
</section>



<section anchor="InterpretingProvider" title="Interpreting &lt;provider&gt; values">
<t> 
The organization that defines a particular &lt;private-name&gt; is
   determined by the &lt;provider&gt; within the &lt;private-name&gt;.  An
   &lt;alert-label&gt; that follows a &lt;private-name&gt; is defined by the
   organization determined by the &lt;provider&gt; within the
   &lt;private-name&gt;.
</t>
<t>
   The organization determined by a &lt;provider&gt; is the organization
   that was the registered owner of the contained &lt;provider-id&gt; (which
   is a fully-qualified domain name) on the given date &lt;date&gt;
   (interpreted according to the following default rules).  If the
   &lt;date&gt; is omitted, it defaults to "2013-01-01".  If the century
   part &lt;CC&gt; is omitted, it defaults to "20".  If the month part &lt;MM&gt;
   or the day part &lt;DD&gt; is omitted, it defaults to "01".  In addition,
   if an organization is the first registrant of a domain name (over
   all time), it may use any &lt;date&gt; preceding when it registered the
   domain name.
</t>
<t>
   More specifically:  On every date on which an organization is the
   registered owner of a domain name, the organization acquires an
   intellectual property right to define the meaning of
  &lt;private-name&gt;s and &lt;alert-label&gt;s that are governed by a
   &lt;provider&gt; value specifying that domain name and that date
   (directly or by defaults).  If an organization is the first
   registrant of a domain name, on the date it obtains the
   registration, it also acquires those rights for all &lt;provider&gt;
   values specifying that domain name and any date before the date of
   registration.  Unless otherwise arranged, these intellectual
   property rights transfer if the organization transfers the right to
   use the domain name.  However, if the organization's registration
   expires and another organization acquires registration of the
   domain name de novo, the first organization retains the &lt;provider&gt;
   rights that it possessed regarding that domain name.

<section anchor="ExamplesExtenssion" title="Examples">
<section anchor="SubsettingAnExistingURN" title="Subsetting an existing URN">
<t> 
A company owning the domain name somecompany.example.com can
   define distinctive versions of &lt;urn:alert:service:call-waiting&gt;:
</t><t>
   <list>				
			<t>urn:alert:service:call-waiting:abc@somecompany.example.com</t>
           <t>urn:alert:service:call-waiting:def@somecompany.example.com</t>
   </list>
</t><t>
   It can create a more specialized URN that applies to a subset of
   the situations to which the first URN above applies:
</t><t>
   <list>
         <t>urn:alert:service:call-waiting:abc@somecompany.example.com:xyz</t>
         </list>
</t><t>
   Because "xyz" follows "abc@somecompany.example.com" (and there is
   no intervening &lt;private-name&gt;), its meaning is defined by the owner
   of the &lt;provider&gt; "somecompany.example.com" (whose implicit date is
   "2013-01-01").
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="ANewValueWithinAnAlertCategory" title="A new value within an &lt;alert-category&gt;">
<t> 
 A company owning the domain name somecompany.example.com can

</t><t>
  <list>				
			<t> urn:alert:service:ghi@somecompany.example.com</t>
   </list>
</t><t>
   However, before defining such a URN, the organization should verify
   that the set of calls to which the URN applies is not a subset of
   the set of calls for some existing URN.  If it is a subset, the
   extension URN should be a subdivision of the existing URN.

</section>
<section anchor="ANewAlertCategory" title="A new &lt;alert-category&gt;">

  <list>

The company designated by "a.example.com(2013)" wants to define a
    set of URNs that specify the different ring patterns used by a
    "distinctive ring" service to alert for incoming calls that are
    directed to different directory numbers.  These ring patterns are
    composed of groups of ring sounds that have particular patterns of
    lengths.
</t><t>
    The company can create a private &lt;alert-category&gt;
    "distinctive@a.example.com", and within it assign three 'alert'
    URNs that indicate the three different ring patterns used by the
    company's service:
</t><t>
<list>
	<t>
urn:alert:distinctive@a.example.com:long-long

</t>
</list>

<t> 
Later, the company designated by "b.example.com(2013)" wants to
    define an additional 'alert' URN for the ring pattern "short short",
    which it uses to support a fourth directory number for a phone
    instrument.  The company can create a &lt;private-name&gt; to be used with
    the "distinctive@a.example.com" &lt;alert-category&gt;:

Alert-Info header fields only contain "alert" URNs.  Other combinations
 of URIs in the Alert-Info header fields of the same SIP
    message are not defined in this specification.</t>
	<t>In many cases, more than one URN will be needed to fully define a
      particular tone. This is done by including multiple "alert" URNs, in
      one or more Alert-Info header fields in a request or a response. 

For example, an internal, priority call could be indicated by
 Alert-Info: &lt;urn:alert:source:internal&gt;, &lt;urn:alert:priority:high&gt;
A priority call waiting tone could be indicated by
Alert-Info: &lt;urn:alert:service:call-waiting&gt;, &lt;urn:alert:priority:high&gt;
</t>
				<t>
The sender of the Alert-Info header field may include an
arbitrary list of "alert" URNs, even if they are redundant or
contradictory.  An earlier URN has priority over any later
contradictory URN.  This allows any element to modify a list of URNs
to require a feature value (by adding a URN at the beginning of the
list) or to suggest a feature value (by adding a URN at the end of the
list).</t>
				<t>The receiving UA matches the received "alert" URN
combination with the signal(s) it is able to render. </t>
				<t>The implementation is free to ignore an "alert" URN if it does
   not recognize the URN, or if it is incapable of rendering its
   effect in the context.  Similarly, it can remove a final series of
   one or more &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s of an "alert" URN to create a
   "more generic" URN which it recognizes and whose meaning it can
render in the context.</t>

   <t>The exact way in which a UA renders a received
 combination of "alert" URNs is 
      left as an implementation issue.  However, the implementation  MUST comply to following rules:</t>
				<t><list>
						<t>a. Each "alert" URN has precedence over all URNs that follow it, and
  its interpretation is subordinate to all URNs that precede it.</t>
  <t></t>
						<t> b.  If the UA cannot implement the effect of a URN (because it does
  not recognize the URN or the URN's effect is precluded by 
preceding URNs), the UA repeatedly removes the final
 &lt;alert-ind-part&gt; of the URN until either</t>
					<t><list>
								<t> (i) the resulting URN is recognized and can be given effect by
      some signal (without reducing the degree of expression of
      any preceding URN), or </t>
      <t></t>
								<t>(ii) the resulting URN is reduced to having no &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;
       in which case, that URN in the series cannot be given effect, and
       so is ignored.</t>
							</list></t>
<t></t>							
						<t>c. In case that after processing all the received URNs, the UA can generate more
  than one signal that are equally effective at expressing the URNs
  (under the preceding rules), one of those signals is selected.  
  When selecting from the set of equally effective signals, no signal
   should be chosen if a less-specific signal is also in the set.
   (Specificity is to be judged based on the defined meanings of the
   signals to the user.)  (E.g., if each signal is considered to
   express certain &lt;alert-indication&gt;s of certain &lt;alert-categories&gt;, one
   signal is less-specific than a second signal if the first signal's
   &lt;alert-indication&gt;s are a subset or are prefixes of the second signal's
   &lt;alert-indication&gt;s.)  However, a more-specific signal may be chosen if the choice is
   based on information derived from the containing SIP message.
   E.g., a signal implying &lt;urn:alert:priority:high&gt; may be chosen
   if the SIP message contains the header  field "Priority: urgent".</t>
					</list></t>
				<t>In all situations, the set of signals that can be rendered and
   their significances may change based on user preferences and local
   policy. </t>
 <t>In addition, the chosen signal may change based on the status of
   the UA.  E.g., if a call is active on the UA, all audible signals
   may become unavailable, or audible signals may be available only if

   &lt;urn:alert:priority:high&gt; is specified.</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="MultiModeSignals" title="Multi-mode signals ">
				<t>There are cases when the device can render two signal modes (e.g.,
 audio and visual, or video or text) at the same time.</t>
				<t>Formally, the device must be considered as making its choice from
 the 
set of all combined signals that it can render (pairs of one signal
  from the first mode and one signal from the second mode), and that choice must
conform to the above rules.  However, it can be proven that if
 the device makes its rendering choice for each of the two modes
 independently, with each choice separately conforming to the above
 rules, its combined choice conforms to the above rules, when it is
 regarded as a choice from among all possible combinations.</t>
				<t>In such a situation, it may simplify implementation to make each
 choice separately.  It is an implementation decision whether to chose
 from among combined signals, or to combine choices made from each
 signal mode. </t>

<!-- ALGORITHM
-->		
		<section anchor="Algorithm" title="Non-normative Algorithm for Handling Combinations of URNs">
			<t>The following text is a non-normative example of an algorithm for
   handling combinations of URNs that complies with the rules 
   in  <xref target="ExtensionRules"></xref> and <xref target="Combinations"></xref>.  
   Thus, it demonstrates that the rules 
      are consistent and implementable.  (Of course, a device may use any
   other algorithm which complies with <xref target="ExtensionRules"></xref> and <xref target="Combinations"></xref>.)</t>
			<section anchor="AlgorithmDescription" title=" Algorithm Description">
				<t>   For each &lt;alert-category&gt; (feature) known by the implementation,
   there is a "feature tree" of the known &lt;alert-indication&gt;s for that
   &lt;alert-category&gt;, with the sequence of &lt;alert-ind-part&gt;s in an
   &lt;alert-indication&gt; specifying the path in the tree from the root to
   the node representing the &lt;alert-indication&gt;.  For this
   description, we will name each tree and its root node by the
   &lt;alert-category&gt;  name, and name each non-root node by the
   &lt;alert-identifier&gt;.  Each URN thus corresponds to one non-root node
   in one feature tree.
For example, there is a tree
   named "source", whose root node is also named "source", and which has
   the children source:internal, source:external, source:friend, and
   source:family.  The URN &lt;urn:alert:source:external&gt; is placed at
   the node "source:external" in the "source" tree.  If the
   implementation understands &lt;urn:alert:source:foo@example.com&gt;, there
   is a node source:foo@example.com that is a child of node "source".
   If the implementation understands
   &lt;urn:alert:source:external:bar@example.com&gt;, there is a node
   source:external:bar@example.com that is a child of node
   source:external.
   (Of course, there
   are an infinite number of potential additional nodes in the tree for
   private values, but we don't have to represent those nodes explicitly
   unless the device has a signal representing the private value.)</t>
				<t>We assign similar locations to signals, but each signal has a
   position in *every* tree, describing the specific combination of
   meanings that it carries.  If a signal has a simple meaning, such
   as "external source", its place in the "source" tree is
   source:external, showing that it carries the "external source"
   meaning, but its place in every other feature tree is at the root
   node, meaning that it has no particular meaning for those features.</t>
				<t> A signal that has a complex meaning may have non-root positions in
   more than one feature tree.  For example, an "external, high
   priority" signal would be placed at source:external and priority:high
   in those trees, but be at the root in all other feature trees.</t>

				<t> In order to assure that the algorithm always selects at least one
   signal, we require that there is a "default" signal, whose position in
   every feature tree is at the root.  This default signal
   will never be excluded from the set of acceptable signals for
   any set of URNs, but will be the lowest-priority signal for any
   set of URNs.</t>
				<t>The algorithm proceeds by considering each URN in the received Alert-
   Info header fields from left to right, while revising a set of signals.  The
   set of signals starts as the entire set of signals available to the
   device.  Each URN excludes some signals from the set, and *sorts* the
   signals that remain in the set according to how well they represent
   the URN.  (The details of these operations are described below.)  The
   first URN is the "major sort", and has the most influence on the
   position of a signal in the set.  The second URN is a "minor sort",
   in that it arranges the orders of the signals that are tied within
   the first sort, the third URN arranges the orders of the signals that
   are tied within the first two sorts, etc.</t>
				<t>At the end of the algorithm, a final, "most minor" sort is done,
   which orders the signals which remain tied under all the sorts
   driven by the URNs.  This final sort places the least specific
   signals (within their tied groups) *first*.  (If one signal's position in
   each feature tree is ancestral or the same as a second signal's
   position in that tree, the first signal is "less specific" than the
   second signal.  Other cases are left to the implementation to
   decide.)</t>
				<t>Once all the URNs are processed and the sorting of the signals that
   have not been excluded is done, the device
   selects the first signal in the set.</t>
				<t>Here is how a single sort step proceeds, examining a single URN to
   modify the set of signals (by excluding some signals and further
   sorting the signals that remain):</t>
				<t><list style="symbols">
						<t>The URN specifies a specific node in a specific feature tree.</t>
	
						<t>All signals in the set that are, within that feature tree,
      positioned at the URN's node, or at an ancestor node of the
      URN's node, are kept.  All other signals are removed from the
      set (because they have meanings that are incompatible with the
      URN's meaning).</t>

						<t>Each group of signals that are tied under the previous sorts are
      further sorted into groups based on how much of the URN's
      meaning they represent: those which are positioned at the node of the URN
      are tied for first position, those which are positioned at the parent node
      of the URN are tied for second position, etc., and those which
      are positioned at the root node of the feature tree are tied for last
      position.</t>

				<section anchor="Example_1" title="Example 1">
					<t>The device has a set of 4 alerting signals. We list their primary meanings, and the

			<t>Upon receiving a SIP INVITE request or a SIP provisional response

      the UA uses MUST conform to the rules described in     <xref target="Combinations"></xref>.  (A non-normative algorithm example for the process is described

   field values specifying both a network audio resource referenced by the

   allows the UAC to render the network audio resource, or to choose a
