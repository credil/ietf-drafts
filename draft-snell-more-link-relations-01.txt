1.  Introduction

   This specification defines and adds the following additional link
   relation types to the IANA Registry of Link Relations established by
   [RFC5988]: to, bto, cc, bcc, from, bfrom, source, generator,
   provider, location, alias and mentionedBy.  Further, this
   specification proposes a new 'social' URN namespace.

   Note that this document is a work-in-progress draft specification
   that does not yet represent a "standard".  It is the intention of
   this specification to propose a few new ideas and openly solicit
   feedback on their definition and use.  While this document might
   eventually evolve into an RFC the ideas described herein have not yet
   been broadly implemented and have definitions that may evolve through
   successive iterations of this draft.

2.  The 'social' URN Namespace

   This specification defines the 'social' URN namespace having the
   following structure:

   urn:social:{NSS}


   The Namespace Specific String (NSS) MUST be one of:

   o  everyone

   o  direct



Snell                    Expires March 27, 2014                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft             More Link Relations            September 2013


   o  extended

   o  peer

   o  subordinate

   o  superior

   o  common

   o  interested

   o  self

   Within any given social networking system, there is an available
   population of entities.  Each NSS term represent specific subsets of
   this population and are defined in terms of these subsets relative to
   a fixed context.  For example, if the fixed content is a person, the
   "urn:social:direct" URN identifies the subset of the total population
   that is directly connected to the context person within the social
   graph, while the "urn:social:extended" URN identifies the subset that
   is directly or indirectly connected to the context person.

   The 'social' URN namespace is defined to be intentionally ambiguous
   and contextually dependent.  The specific interpretation of each NSS
   depends entirely on how and where the NSS is being used.

2.1.  urn:social:everyone

   The "urn:social:everyone" URN identifies the subset of the total
   population that is visible to the context.

2.2.  urn:social:direct

   The "urn:social:direct" URN identifies the subset of the total
   population that is both visible to and directly connected to the
   context.

2.3.  urn:social:extended

   The "urn:social:extended" URN identifies the subset of the total
   population that is visible to and connected either directly or
   indirectly to the context.

2.4.  urn:social:peer

Internet-Draft             More Link Relations            September 2013


   The "urn:social:peer" URN identifies the subset of the total
   population that is both visible to the context and considered to be a
   "peer".

   Peer relationships exist only within populations in which there
   exists a hierarchical division of members in the population.  An
   example of such a network would be a company or similarly structured
   organization.  Peers might be directly or indirectly connected to the
   target resource but are considered to share the same hierarchical
   position.

2.5.  urn:social:subordinate

   The "urn:social:subordinate" URN identifies the subset of the total
   population that is both visible to the context and considered to be
   "subordinate" to the context.

   Subordinate relationships exist only within populations in which
   there exists a hierarchical division of members in the population.
   An example of such a network would be a company or similarly
   structured organization.  Subordinates might be directly or
   indirectly connected to the target resource but are considered to
   share a lower hierarchical position.

2.6.  urn:social:superior

   The "urn:social:superior" URN identifies the subset of the total
   population that is both visible to the context and considered to be
   "superior" to the context.

   Superior relationships exist only within populations in which there
   exists a hierarchical division of members in the population.  An
   example of such a network would be a company or similarly structured
   organization.  Superiors might be directly or indirectly connected to
   the target resource but are considered to have a higher hierarchical
   position.

2.7.  urn:social:common

   The "urn:social:common" URN identifies the subset of the total
   population that is both visible to the context and is determined to
   share the same common attributes as the context.

   Determination of "common attributes" is dependent entirely on the
   application.  For example, an application might choose to use shared
   interests in a given topic as the "common attribute" binding a
   particular grouping of members.

2.8.  urn:social:interested

   The "urn:social:interested" URN identifies the subset of the total
   population that is both visible to the context and has an express
   interest in the context.  Examples of members of the "interested"
   subset are those who have elected to "follow" the activity of the
   context resource.

2.9.  urn:social:self

   The "urn:social:self" URN identifies the context resource itself as a
   member of the total population.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The following Link Relations are added to the IANA Registry of Link
   Relations.

   +---------------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | Name          | Description                                       |

   | to            | Refers to a resource that is considered to be     |
   |               | part of the public primary audience of the link's |
   |               | context.                                          |
   | bto           | Refers to a resource that is considered to be     |
   |               | part of the private primary audience of the       |
   |               | link's context.                                   |
   | cc            | Refers to a resource that is considered to be     |
   |               | part of the public secondary audience of the      |
   |               | link's context.                                   |
   | bcc           | Refers to a resource that is considered to be     |
   |               | part of the private secondary audience of the     |
   |               | link's context.                                   |
   | from          | Refers to a resource that is publicly considered  |
   |               | to be the originator of the link's context.       |
   | bfrom         | Refers to a resource that is privately considered |
   |               | to be the orignator of the link's context.        |
   | source        | Refers to the original source of information      |
   |               | contained by the context resource.                |
   | provider      | Refers to the resource that provided the context  |
   |               | resource.  Typically, this would be used to       |
   |               | identify the entity publishing the resource.      |
   | generator     | Refers to the resource that generated the context |
   |               | resource.  Typically, this would be used to       |
   |               | identify the software application that created    |
   |               | the context resource.                             |
   | mentionedBy   | Refers to a resource that mentions the context    |
   |               | resource in some fashion. This, for example,      |

   |               | would be used when an article mentions another    |
   |               | article, or a social status update mentions a     |
   |               | particular user, etc.                             |
   | location      | References a URI/IRI that represents a physical   |
   |               | or logical location with which the context        |
   |               | resource is associated.                           |
