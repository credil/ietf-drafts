Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                       June 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a framework for improving the security of the
   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) in two respects.
   First, it introduces the concept of a prooftype for establishing a
   strong association between a domain name and an XML stream (i.e., a
   domain name association or "DNA").  Second, it provides guidelines
   for securely delegating a source domain to a derived domain, which is
   especially important in virtual hosting environments.

   The need to establish a strong association between a domain name and
   an XML stream arises in both client-to-server and server-to-server
   communication using XMPP, because XMPP servers are typically
   identified by domain names.  However, a client or peer server needs
   to verify the identity of a server to which it connects.  To date,
   such verification has been established based on information obtained
   from the Domain Name System (DNS), the Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI), or similar sources.  This document generalizes the model
   currently in use so that additional prooftypes can be defined, and
   also provides a basis for modernizing some prooftypes (e.g., Server
   Dialback [XEP-0220]) to reflect progress in several underlying
   technologies, especially DNS Security [RFC4033].

   The process for resolving the domain name of an XMPP service into the
   IP address at which an XML stream will be negotiated (defined in
   [RFC6120]) can involve delegation of a source domain (say,
   im.example.com) to a derived domain (say, hosting.example.net).  If
   such delegation is not done in a secure manner, then the domain name
   association cannot be authenticated.  Therefore, this document also
   provides guidelines for defining secure delegation methods.

   This document does not define any DNA prooftypes or secure delegation
   methods; such technologies are defined in companion documents.


2.  Terminology

   This document inherits XMPP-related terminology from [RFC6120] and
   [XEP-0220], DNS-related terminology from [RFC1034], [RFC1035],
   [RFC2782] and [RFC4033], and security-related terminology from
   [RFC4949] and [RFC5280].  The terms "source domain", "derived
   domain", "reference identity", and "presented identity" are used as
   defined in the "CertID" specification [RFC6125].  The terms
   "permissive federation", "verified federation", and "encrypted
   federation" are derived from [XEP-0238], although we substitute the
   term "authenticated federation" for the term "trusted federation"
   from that document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement

   In XMPP, each party to a stream expects the other party to provide
   some proof of its identity.  For example, in client-to-server streams
   the server expects the client to present some credentials (such as a
   username and password or a client certificate), and ideally the
   client also expects the server to provide a certificate that
   identifies the domain(s) of the server.  Similar considerations hold
   true for server-to-server streams, also called "interdomain
   federation".

   When the Jabber.org open-source community developed the precursor to
   XMPP in 1999, it defined methods for interdomain federation but no
   mechanisms for authenticating or checking the identity of peer
   servers.  We could describe this as "permissive federation", which is
   clearly sub-optimal given the strong potential for domain spoofing.
   In the year 2000, the community filled the gap to some extent by
   defining a technology called Server Dialback (first documented in
   [RFC3920] and since moved to [XEP-0220]).  Although Server Dialback
   does not provide a strong mechanism for identity checking without the
   use of DNSSEC, it does provide DNS-based verification and thus has
   effectively prevented most instances of domain spoofing on the XMPP
   network since late 2000.  Also, because Server Dialback typically
   does not involve the use of server certificates, it does not result
   in an encrypted stream; thus we refer to it as a technology for
   "verified federation".

   In 2002-2004, the IETF's XMPP Working Group hardened the original
   Jabber.org protocols by adding Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
   Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), thus making it
   possible for two servers to engage in "authenticated federation"
   (i.e., when two peer servers present PKIX certificates anchored to
   trusted roots during negotiation of a server-to-server stream) or
   "encrypted federation" (i.e., when two peer servers present PKIX
   certificates that are self-signed or not anchored to trusted roots
   during negotiation of a server-to-server stream).

   Unfortunately, authenticated federation has not been widely deployed
   on the XMPP network (indeed, even encrypted federation is not widely
   deployed because verified federation is perceived as "good enough");
   one of the primary reasons is that it is feasible (although not
   always easy) for single-domain servers to obtain the proper



Saint-Andre & Miller    Expires December 29, 2012               [Page 4]

   certificates, but much more difficult (or practically impossible) for
   large XMPP hosting providers to do so.  The primary challenge here is
   operational: it is highly unlikely that an organization (say,
   example.com) wishing to delegate its XMPP service (say,
   im.example.com) to a hosting provider (say, hosting.example.net) will
   hand over its private key to the hosting provider.  Even if that were
   feasible, further operational challenges (e.g., maintaining large
   numbers of certificates for hosted domains, and configuring XMPP
   software to present the correct certificate based on the 'to' address
   of the initial stream header) have also discouraged deployment of
   authenticated federation in virtual hosting environments, which
   happen to be a common deployment scenario.

   Furthermore, the prevalence of delegation to hosting providers leads
   to one additional shortcoming, caused by the use of DNS SRV records
   [RFC2782] in XMPP: if DNSSEC is not used, the act of delegation is
   inherently insecure.  Unfortunately, no existing documentation
   explains how to use DNSSEC for secure delegation, with the result
   that clients and servers often take a "leap of faith" if using an SRV
   record to determine that when communicating with, say, im.example.com
   they actually need to connect to, say, hosting.example.net.

   In order to meet the requirements for strong security [RFC3365], both
   authenticated federation and secure delegation are needed so that the
   association between a domain name and an XML stream can be trusted by
   XMPP entities.  Unfortunately, authenticated federation is uncommon
   and secure delegation is unheard of on the XMPP network today.
   Because the current situation is clearly sub-optimal, this document
   defines a framework for both authenticated federation and secure
   delegation in XMPP.


4.  Framework

   In essence, we need to establish an association between a domain and
   an XML stream: is the XMPP server to which a client or peer server
   connects "allowed" to accept stanzas for or send stanzas from a given
   domain?  If so, we say that there is a domain name association
   ("DNA") for the stream.

   For TLS in general, the TLS client has some expectations about the
   identity of the TLS server (in the language of the "CertID"
   specification [RFC6125], the TLS client has a "reference identity"),
   and then checks some material presented by the TLS server (the
   "presented identity" within the server certificate) to verify that
   its expectations have been met.  In XMPP, Server Dialback follows a
   similar model, except that the verification material takes the form
   of a token instead of a certificate.  The DNS-Based Authentication of



Saint-Andre & Miller    Expires December 29, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                       June 2012


   Named Entities protocol [DANE], at least in some of its modes, adds
   another kind of verification material: not the presented identity
   within a PKIX certificate, but a complete certificate or hash
   thereof.  And other kinds of verification material could be
   envisioned (e.g., OpenPGP keys, Kerberos tickets, OAuth tokens),
   although they are not considered here.

   No matter what kind of verification material is used, an XMPP client
   or peer server that wishes to verify a domain name association needs
   a way to obtain the verification material it will refer to when
   establishing the association.  For instance, when a server presents a
   PKIX certificate during TLS negotiation, the connecting client or
   peer server has traditionally obtained its verification material out
   of band or via configuration from a certification authority (i.e., in
   the form of a root certificate contained in a certificate bundle).
   In the Server Dialback protocol, the verification material is a token
   that is obtained over XMPP itself.  In DANE, the verification
   material is obtained from the Domain Name System.  In the PKIX Over
   Secure HTTP ("POSH") method described in an accompanying
   specification, the verification material is obtained over secure
   HTTP.  And other methods for obtaining verification material could be
   envisioned (e.g., IPsec), although they are not considered here.

   Furthermore, the matching rules for checking the verification
   material will depend on the nature of that material; for example,
   [RFC6120] defines a profile of the rules from the "CertID"
   specification [RFC6125], Server Dialback [XEP-0220] typically
   performs a character-for-character comparison of tokens, DANE might
   compare the SubjectPublicKeyInfo data or the full certificate, and so
   on.

   Finally, given the relationship between XMPP and the DNS (XMPP
   services are usually identified by domain name, not IP address), it
   is important to make it clear whether a given verification method can
   (or must) be used only with secure DNS or also with insecure DNS.

   Putting these pieces together, we define a "DNA prooftype" as
   follows.

   prooftype:  A mechanism for proving an association between a domain
      name and an XML stream, where the mechanism defines (1) the
      verification material to be used, (2) the matching rules for
      comparing the reference version and presented version of the
      material, (3) how the verification material is obtained, and (4)
      whether the mechanism depends on secure DNS.

   The following sections outline several prooftypes that are used, or
   could be used, in XMPP; detailed definitions are provided in separate

   specifications.

   Note: So far, our definition of a prooftype does not include the
   exact protocol mechanism that is used to assert a domain name; this
   is explained further under Section 6.


5.  Prooftypes

5.1.  PKI

   The PKI prooftype is a DNA proof that follows the rules from
   [RFC6120]: that is, the verification materials consist of a PKIX
   certificate that is checked according to a profile of the matching
   rules from [RFC6125], the client's verification materials are
   obtained out of band in the form of a trusted root, and secure DNS is
   not necessary.

5.2.  DANE

   In the DANE prooftype, the verification materials consist of a PKIX
   certificate that is compared as an exact match or a hash of either
   the SubjectPublicKeyInfo or the full certificate, and the
   verification materials are obtained via secure DNS.  See the
   accompanying [XMPP-DANE] spec for complete discussion and examples.

5.3.  POSH

   POSH stands for PKIX Over Secure HTTP: the verification materials
   consist of a PKIX certificate, it is obtained by retrieving it over
   HTTPS at a well-known URI [RFC5785], the certificate is checked
   according to the rules from [RFC6120] and [RFC6125], and secure DNS
   is not necessary since the HTTPS retrieval mechanism relies on the
   chain of trust from the public key infrastructure.  See the
   accompanying [XMPP-POSH] spec for complete discussion and examples.

5.4.  Dialback Keys

   The Dialback Keys prooftype formalizes the existing Server Dialback
   protocol: the verification materials consist of a token obtained over
   XMPP, the token is checked by the authoritative server for a given
   domain using implementation-specific methods such as character-by-
   character comparison, and secure DNS is needed in order to place
   significant trust in such tokens, although it is known that at the
   time of this writing many domains use Dialback Keys even in the
   absence of secure DNS.

Internet-Draft                  XMPP DNA                       June 2012


6.  Assertion Mechanisms

   An assertion is a server's statement that an XML stream is to be
   associated with the asserted domain.

6.1.  TLS

   During TLS negotiation, an XMPP server acting as a TLS server sends
   its certificate to the connecting client or peer server acting as a
   TLS client.  This certificate is interpreted as an assertion of the
   server's identity.

6.2.  SASL

   During SASL negotiation after TLS negotiation, an XMPP server acting
   as a TLS server can include an authorization identity; such an
   authzid is an assertion of the server's identity.

6.3.  <db:result>

   When two servers use the Server Dialback protocol [XEP-0220], the
   originating server asserts its identity by sending a <db:result/>
   element to the receiving server, where the 'from' attribute specifies
   the domain name being asserted by the originating server.

   Note: Although historically the <db:result/> element has contained a
   dialback key as XML character data, the <db:result/> element can also
   be used without dialback keys as a mere assertion; this usage is
   sometimes colloquially referred to as "dialback without dialback".

6.4.  A Note about Stream Attributes

   XML streams include 'to' and 'from' attributes.  However, these are
   not assertions of identity, and are merely early indications of the
   identity that a client or server will later assert during TLS
   negotiation, SASL negotiation, or Server Dialback negotiation.


7.  Delegation Methods

   Although domain name associations are closely tied to delegation in
   some scenarios, delegation is irrelevant when the source domain is
   exactly the same as the hostname of the XMPP service, as is often the
   case with single-domain services.  There are two methods for secure
   delegation: DNSSEC (see the [XMPP-DANE] spec) and HTTPS Redirect (see
   the [XMPP-POSH] spec).

   considerations provided in [RFC6120] and [RFC6125].
