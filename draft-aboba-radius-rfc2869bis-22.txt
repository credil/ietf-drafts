This document defines Remote Authentication Dial In User Service
(RADIUS) support for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an
authentication framework which supports multiple authentication
mechanisms.  In the proposed scheme, the Network Access Server (NAS)
forwards EAP packets to and from the RADIUS server, encapsulated
within EAP-Message attributes.  This has the advantage of allowing the
NAS to support any EAP authentication method, without the need for 
method-specific code, which resides on the RADIUS server.  While EAP
was originally developed for use with PPP, it is now also in use with
IEEE 802.
