	Extensions to OSPF-TE, ISIS-TE, and RSVP-TE are defined in
	support of carrying LSP with strict packet ordering
	requirements over multipath and and carrying LSP with strict
	packet ordering requirements within LSP without violating
	requirements to maintain packet ordering.  LSP with strict
	packet ordering requirements include MPLS-TP LSP.
      </t>
      <t>
	OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE extensions defined here indicate node and

	support multipath load distribution differently per LSP.
      </t>
      <t>
	RSVP-TE extensions either identifies an LSP as requiring
	strict packet order, or identifies an LSP as carrying one or
	more LSP that requires strict packet order further down in the
	label stack, or identifies an LSP as having no restrictions on
	packet ordering except the restriction to avoid reordering
	microflows.  In addition an extension indicates whether the
	first nibble of payload will reliably indicate whether payload
	is IPv4, IPv6, or other type of payload, most notably
	pseudowire using a pseudowire control word.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Today the requirement to handle large aggregations of traffic,
	can be handled by a number of techniques which we will
	collectively call multipath.  Multipath is very similar to
	composite link as defined in <xref target="ITU-T.G.800" />,
	except multipath specifically excludes inverse multiplexing.
	Some types of LSP, including but potentially not limited to
	MPLS-TP LSP, require strict packet ordering.
      </t>
      <t>
	A means to support a MPLS-TP client layer over a MPLS server
	layer using MPLS Entropy Label is defined in
	<xref target="I-D.villamizar-mpls-multipath-use" />.  It is
	noted in <xref target="I-D.villamizar-mpls-multipath-use" />
	that absent some protocol extensions, some limitations must be
	accepted.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document defines protocol extensions which better
	supports using MPLS with multipath as a server layer for
	MPLS-TP, or to carry MPLS-TP directly over a network which
	makes use of multipath.  Extensions are also applicable to
	MPLS when used in the presense of very large microflows or
	very large LSP which cannot be load split as a result of using
	MPLS Entropy Label
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-entropy-label" />.
      </t>

      <section title="Architecture Summary">

	<t>
	  Advertisements in a link state routing protocol, such as OSPF
	  or ISIS, support a topology map known as a link state database
	  (LSDB).  When traffic engineering information is included in
	  the LSDB the topology map is known as a TE-LSDB or traffic
	  engineering database (TED).
	</t>
	<t>
	  A common MPLS LSP path computation is known as a constrained
	  shortest path first computation (CSPF) (see <xref
	  target="RFC3945" />).  Other algorithms may be used for path
	  computation.  Constraint-based routing was first introduced in
	  <xref target="RFC2702" />).
	</t>
	<t>
	  OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE extensions are defined in <xref
	  target="node-capability" /> and <xref
	  target="link-capability" />.  OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE
	  advertisements serve to populate the TE-LSDB and provide the
	  basis for constraint-based routing path computation.  <xref
	  target="usage.adv" /> describes the use of OSPF-TE or
	  ISIS-TE multipath extensions in routing advertisements.
	</t>
	<t>
	  RSVP-TE extensions are defined in <xref target="rsvp_mpa_tlv" />.
	  <xref target="usage.rsvp" /> describes the use of RSVP-TE
	  extensions in setting up LSP including signaling constraints
	  on LSP which contain other LSP which specify RSVP-TE
	  extensions.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <xref target="usage.cspf" /> describes the
	  constraints on LSP path computation imposed by the
	  advertised ordered aggregate and multipath capabilities of
	  links.  <xref target="usage.ip-in-cspf" /> describes the
	  constraints on LSP path computation imposed by link
	  advertisements regarding use of IP headers in multipath
	  traffic distribution.  <xref target="usage.depth" />
	  describes the impact of label stack depth limitations.

	<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3">
	  <t hangText="Ordered Aggregate (OA)">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    An ordered aggregate (OA) requires that packets be delivered
	    in the order in which they were received.  Please refer to
	    <xref target="RFC3260" />.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Microflow">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    A microflow is a single instance of an application-to-
	    application flow.  Please refer to <xref target="RFC2475"
	    />.  Reordering packets within a microflow can cause service
	    disruption.  Please refer to <xref target="RFC2991" />.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Multipath Traffic Distribution">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Multipath traffic distribution refers to the mechanism which
	    distributes traffic among a set of component links or
	    component lower layer paths which together comprise a
	    multipath.  No assumptions are made about the algorithms
	    used in multipath traffic distribution.  This document only
	    discusses constraints of the type of information which can
	    be used as the basis for multipath traffic distribution in
	    specific circumstances.
	  </t>
	</list></t>
	<t>
	  The phrase "strict packet ordering requirements" refers to the
	  requirement to deliver all packet in the order that they were
	  received.  The absence of strict packet ordering requirements
	  does not imply total absence of packet ordering requirements.
	  The requirement to avoid reordering traffic within any given
	  microflow, as described in <xref target="RFC2991" /> applies
	  to all traffic aggregates including all MPLS LSP.
	</t>

	  <t>
	    In these mixed networks it may not be possible to reliably
	    support LSP which require strict packet ordering.  It is
	    not possible to know where Ethernet Link Aggregation is
	    used and it is not possible to accurately determine Link
	    Bundling behavior on link bundles where "Maximum LSP
	    Bandwidth" is equal to "Unreserved Bandwidth".
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Upgrading LSR to support Entropy Label on both LAG and
	    Link Bundles would improve the ability to carry LSP which
	    require strict packet ordering.  To gain any benefit the
	    LSP ingress would have to add ELI and EL.

	  <t>
	    If not all LSR are upgraded, then the MPLS TE multipath
	    extensions identify those LSR and multipath that have been

	<t>
	  If a Multipath Node Capability sub-TLV is not advertised
	  (see <xref target="node-capability" />), then the LSR does
	  not support these multipath extensions.  This allows
	  detection of such nodes and if necessary application of
	  defaults to cover legacy multipath such as typical Ethernet
	  Link Aggregation Behavior.
	</t>

	<section anchor="compat.simple"
		 title="Simple Transitions">

	  <t>
	    For networks with LSR that do not support multipath
	    extensions, transition is easiest if all legacy LSR
	    support and are configured with a common link bundling
	    behavior.  If Ethernet Link Aggregation is not used, a
	    single configured default is needed to cover LSR that do
	    not advertise a Multipath Node Capability sub-TLV.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    If Ethernet Link Aggregation had been previously used on
	    Legacy LSR, if possible LAG should be disabled and the
	    members of the former LAG configured and advertised as a
	    link bundle which uses the equivalent "all ones" behavior.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    If Ethernet Link Aggregation remains but can be identified
	    in some way, such as links with capacity in excess of some
	    value (for example: greater than 10 Gb/s), then defaults
	    can be set up for these LAG.  Alternately administrative
	    attributes could be used <xref target="RFC3209" />.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The transition network in this case lacks the ability to
	    determine the largest microflow that can pass through
	    legacy nodes, but this was the case prior to transition
	    for the entire network prior to transition.
	  </t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="compat.rough"
		 title="More Challenging Transitions">

	  <t>
	    Transition is made more difficult if legacy LSR in a
	    network support Ethernet Link Aggregation but do not
	    support Link Bundle and cannot be identified by simple
	    means, or the newer LSR lack sufficient configuration
	    capability to support conditional defaults.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    This situation is most easily handled if a small upgrade
	    to such an LSR can advertise a fixed Multipath Node
	    Capability sub-TLV giving the characteristics of the
	    Ethernet Link Aggregation implementation on that node.
	    Absent of such cooperation, the problem can be solved by
	    configuration on newer LSR which allows association of a
	    Multipath Node Capability sub-TLV with a specific legacy
	    router ID and possibly a legacy router ID and link.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    LSR supporting Multipath Extensions will need to assign
	    default values through configuration to these legacy LSR
	    running Ethernet Link Aggregation.  These default values
	    serve to allow LSP which require strict packet ordering to
	    avoid these legacy LSR.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    LSR which do not support <xref target="RFC4201" /> may be
	    sufficiently rare that the ability to assign default
	    values per legacy LSR or per <xref target="RFC3209" />
	    administrative attribute may not be needed in practice.
