This document describes a way to map Integrated Services Digital
Network User Part (ISUP) overlap signalling to Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP).  This mechanism might be implemented when using SIP in
an environment where part of the call involves interworking with the
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Proposal
Investigation Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
