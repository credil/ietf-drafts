This document describes the Router-port Group Management Protocol
(RGMP).  This protocol was developed by Cisco Systems and is used
between multicast routers and switches to restrict multicast packet
forwarding in switches to those routers where the packets may be
needed.

RGMP is designed for backbone switched networks where multiple, high
speed routers are interconnected.
