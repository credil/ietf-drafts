            Side effect of DNSSEC: an increase of DS queries
             draft-fujiwara-dnsop-ds-query-increase-00.txt

Abstract

   A significant increase of periodic DS queries is observed at top
   level domain (TLD) DNS servers.  Currently, almost all of periodic DS
   queries come from DNSSEC validators and are queries for unsigned
   delegations.  The reason of the increase is low NCACHE TTL value and
   DS nonexistence.  This phenomena is DNSSEC protocol and DNS parameter
   issue.  DS queries will increase as DNSSEC validators will increase.

1.  Problem statement

   Many TLDs have supported DNSSEC.  However, many delegations do not
   have DS resource records.  Some of full-resolvers support DNSSEC
   validation.

   A significant increase of DS queries is observed at JP TLD DNS
   servers.  3.6% of queries are DS queries at JP TLD DNS servers in
   June, 2013 and they are still increasing.  Almost all query names of
   DS queries are unsigned zone cuts.  These DS queries are useless for
   DNSSEC validation because they are unsigned delegations.  Very small
   number of IP addresses send most of DS queries and the DS queries are
   periodic.

   The conditions of this phenomena are as follows.

   o  TLD's TTL value is relatively high, e.g., 86400.

   o  TLD's NCACHE TTL value is low, e.g., 900.

   o  There are many popular query names whose resource record TTLs are
      low, e.g., 300, and they are unsigned.

   o  DNSSEC validators receive queries of popular names frequently,
      e.g.  every 5 minutes.

   An unsigned delegation does not have a DS RR in its TLD zone.  DNSSEC
   validation process starts when the validator receives a query and it
   does not exist in the validator's cache.  DNSSEC validators need to

   know DS RR existence for each query name.  The DS RR nonexistence
   information is cached within NCACHE TTL.  As a result, each DNSSEC
   validator may send DS queries for TLD DNS servers one zone cut per
   NCACHE TTL seconds.

   JP TLD case, NS, DS and glue TTL is 86400 and NCACHE TTL is 900.
   There are many popular names which are unsigned domain names and
   whose TTLs are low.  TTL of "www.yahoo.co.jp" A is 60 (CNAME TTL is
   900 and TTL of aliased name is 60) and TTL of "www.google.co.jp" A is
   300.  Busy full-resolvers receives both queries every minutes or
   more.  When a busy full resolver enables DNSSEC validation, it will
   send "yahoo.co.jp" and "google.co.jp" DS queries every 900 seconds.
   "yahoo.co.jp" NS and "google.co.jp" NS are cached in a day (86400
   seconds).  As a result, queries to JP DNS servers may increase 96
   (86400 / 900) times at the maximum.  This is DNSSEC protocol and
   parameter issue.

2.  Possible affected domain names

   Possible affected domain names are delegation centric domain names
   which support DNSSEC, whose NCACHE TTL is low, and which has popular
   domain names which are not signed and use low TTL values.

   TLDs:  com, net, org, jp use 900 as NCACHE TTL value.  Magnification
      is 96 or more.

   Reverse DNS:  193.in-addr.arpa uses 3600 as NCACHE TTL value.
      Magnification is 48.

   The root is affected a little because popular TLDs have already been
   signed and the magnification is not high, 8 or 24 (86400 / 10800 or
   86400 / 3600).

3.  Possible solutions

   There are four approaches to the problem.

   1.  Lengthen NCACHE TTL value.  However, this approach can not stop
       the increase of DS queries because section 5 of DNS NCACHE
       [RFC2308] recommends negative cache time limit as values of one
       to three hours.  Lengthening NCACHE TTL value over 10800 is
       useless.  Magnification can only be lowered.  (JP case, from 96
       to 8 or 24.)

   2.  Sign all delegations.  If all delegations are signed, DS RR are
       cached.  However, a TLD can not control.

   3.  Lengthen resource record TTL of popular names.  However, a TLD
       can not control.

   4.  Add dummy DS to unsigned delegations.  Dummy DS TTL value is
       controllable.  This proposal requires new digest type.  However,
       using this approach, TLD can not use opt-out technique defined in
       NSEC3 [RFC5155].  Dummy DS RR will be ignored by traditional
       DNSSEC validators because Section 5.2 of DNSSEC Protocol
       [RFC4035] defines that the resolver should treat unknown digest
       type as no DS RRset exists.  BIND 9 and Unbound validators
       ignored dummy DS RR whose digest type is 255.

4.  Possible approaches

   A TLD can control its NCACHE TTL value and its zone.  Possible
   approaches for A TLD are careful query analysis, a combination of
   option 1 and option 4.  Step by step approach is possible.

   1.  Prepare new digest type because it may take long time.

   2.  Careful query analysis.

   3.  If DS queries will increase over 50% of queries, then control
       NCACHE TTL value.

   4.  If DS queries will increase over 50% of queries, then add dummy
       DS RRs to popular unsigned domain names.
