                BGP attribute for QoS SLA advertisement
                 draft-svshah-bgp-qos-sla-attribute-00

Abstract

   Out-of-band manual learning of SLA details and provisioning them in
   general can be complex work for network administrators.  For example,
   Enterprise network administrators not only have to know what is their
   SLA, for voice, video etc application traffic, with their Provider,
   but they also require translating application groups to Classifier
   groups as per provider's definition as well translate SLA to vendor
   specific provisioning language.  An in-band method of QoS signaling
   can help to simplify some of the complexities.  An optional
   transitive BGP attribute proposed in this document intends to signal
   SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as
   Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up some of the
   complex tasks.

   Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is explicitly defined
   in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited to this
   use-case only.

Internet-Draft   BGP attribute for QoS SLA advertisement      March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Definition of traffic classes and services for each traffic class
   between 2 administrative boundaries, typically between Customer's
   Edge (CE) and Provider's Edge (PE) or between one Provider's Edge to
   another Provider's Edge, is contracted.  The contract may exist in
   different variations.  The contract could be full line-rate or sub-
   rate for aggregate traffic.  Or it could be even with further finer
   granular traffic distinction with services defined for standard code-
   points or for specific set of pre-fix or for set of well-known
   application types.  Today, this contract is required to be learned
   out-of-band.  Learning SLAs out-of-band has associated costs with
   provisioning them.

   To over-come complexities associated with out-of-band learning of QoS
   SLA, we are proposing a new BGP attribute to advertise/learn them in-
   band [In rest of the document we may refer "QoS SLA" simply as
   "SLA"].  BGP attribute proposed in this document is intended to
   advertise SLA from one AS to a list of interested AS.  QoS services
   advertised could be for the incoming traffic to the AS community,
   that is advertising SLA or could be for the outgoing traffic from the
   advertiser or could be for both directions.  Reception of and
   reaction to advertised SLAs are optional for the receiver.

   The aim with the signaling of this attribute, across administrative
   boundaries, is to help network administrators speed up and simplify
   QoS provisioning with automatic learning of SLAs and thus avoiding
   complexities and possible errors with manual learning.

   Requirements of QoS SLA advertisement and definition of its details
   is generic and independent of BGP protocol.  However, we find BGP a
   suitable transport for reasons,

     - There is no explicit protocol defined/available today for the
       purpose of QoS SLA exchange
     - The most common use-case of QoS SLA exchange is across Autonomous
       Systems defined by BGP
     - QoS attribute, apart for the use of SLA advertisement, in BGP can
       be extended in the future for specific set of prefixes advertised
       (flow or flow-group), thru BGP updates



   We propose QoS as an optional transitive attribute, keeping SLA
   advertisement as an internal of QoS attribute.  This is to keep QoS
   attribute open for extensions, in future, beyond SLA advertisement.

2.  QoS Attribute Definition

   The QoS Attribute proposed, in BGP, is an optional transitive
   attribute (attribute type code to be assigned by IANA).
   SLA_ADVERTISE is defined as one of the sub-types in the QoS attribute
   value.

       Attribute flags
           highest order bit (bit 0) -
               MUST be set to 1, since this is an optional attribute

           2nd higher order bit (bit 1) -
               MUST be set to 1, since this is a transitive attribute



       The first octet in the Value field of the QoS attribute is
       Attribute specific flag

           highest order bit (bit 0) -
               It defines if update message MUST be dropped (if set to
               1), when this is the last BGP receiver from the list of
               AS this attribute is announced to, or MUST announce (if
               set to 0) further to BGP peers

               The purpose of this bit is discussed further in
               subsequent sections.

           Remaining bits are currently unused and MUST be set to 0


2.1.  SLA_ADVERTISE sub-type Definition

   The Value field for the QoS Attribute contains further TLVs, followed
   to QoS Attribute flag described in previous section.  One of the TLVs
   we define, what is intended in this document, is tuple of (SLA
   advertise sub-type, Length, Value)

      this service type SHOULD be used to further divide Traffic Class
      in multiple sub-classes. Each sub-class then defined with their
      own classifier elements and service types.


3.  Addition of QoS attribute in a BGP update message

   QoS attribute to advertise SLA MUST be added by the originator of a
   BGP update message.  Any BGP speaker in the forwarding path of a
   message MUST NOT insert QoS attribute for the same prefix.

   These messages in general SHOULD NOT be sent periodically just for
   the purpose of keep alive.  Since SLA changes are in-frequent, some
   sort of SLA change policy can be considered as a trigger for
   advertisement.



Shah, et al.            Expires September 2, 2012              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft   BGP attribute for QoS SLA advertisement      March 2012


   For cases where if earlier message has not yet reached to the
   destination, a re-signaling is required.  A new signaling sub-type
   SLA_REQUEST is required for this purpose.  Since BGP messages are
   considered reliable, discussion of SLA_REQUEST, for this purpose or
   any other purpose, is considered out of scope of this document.

   BGP updates triggered as a result of QoS SLA change policy MUST set
   QoS attribute flag to indicate receiver to not advertise BGP updates
   further [Note that this flag is to indicate to drop the whole BGP
   update message, not only QoS attribute].  Alternatively, if receiver
   is next hop, sender MAY set NO_ADVERTISE community instead to
   indicate receiver not to advertise BGP update message to other BGP
   peers beyond next hop.  Sender MUST set one of these fields when BGP
   updates triggered are as a result of QoS SLA change policy.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to always set the QoS attribute flag, to indicate
   receiver to drop BGP update message, when SLA sub-type message also
   contains source AS.  If source AS is set to 0 then it is RECOMMENDED
   to use the community attribute NO_ADVERTISE.

   Community NO_EXPORT MUST be set if QoS SLA not be advertised outside
   a BGP confederation boundary.

   For any SLA modification, originator MUST re-advertise entire SLA.
   There is no provision to advertise partial SLA.  To invalidate
   previously advertised SLA, a message MUST be sent with new SLA
   advertisement with Traffic Class count as 0.

3.1.  SLA Contexts

   In certain cases, advertisement may be to establish QoS SLA for point
   to point connection between a specific destination and a specific
   source.  A point to point connection may be a physical link,
   connecting BGP peers, or may be virtual link (eg. tunnel).  A BGP
   update message, in such cases, with source AS number and NLRI pre-fix
   of source end-point can uniquely identify physical/virtual link
   applicable to advertised SLA.

   In the simplest case where PE and CE are directly connected via a
   physical link and have only single link between them, CE can uniquely
   identify forwarding link to PE with AS number of the PE and NLRI
   prefix being an ip address of PE, to CE (that is next hop ip address
   from CE to PE).  SLA advertised thru BGP update message from PE to
   CE, with PE's AS number and ip address, establishes SLA context for
   the aggregate traffic through link CE to PE.  SLA advertised thru BGP
   update message from PE to CE, with PE's AS number and any other pre-
   fix establishes SLA for that specific pre-fix under CE to PE link.

4.  Processing of QoS attribute at forwarding nodes

4.1.  BGP node capable of processing QoS attribute

   If a BGP node is capable of processing QoS attribute, it optionally
   MAY process the message.  If advertised SLA has list of destination
   AS, it MAY trim list and so count of destination AS to exclude ones
   that are not required in further announcement of BGP updates.

   BGP node MUST drop SLA related sub type from the QoS attribute, if
   none of the AS from the destination list is in the forwarding path.
   Rest of the QoS attributes message MAY be forwarded if there exist
   other sub-types of QoS attribute and forwarding rules meets other
   sub-types requirements.  If there is no other sub-types existing in
   the QoS attribute message then node MUST drop QoS attribute all
   together.  Rest other attributes and NLRI may be announced further if
   it meets rules defined by other attributes and BGP protocol.

   If BGP community, in the update message, is set to NO_ADVERTISE then
   whole BGP update message MUST not be announced further irrespective
   of any of the QoS attribute content.

   If flag in the QoS attribute is set to not announce updates beyond
   listed destinations then message MUST be dropped if there are no
   destination left in the list to advertise to.

   If SLA message is meant to be broadcast then message MUST not be
   dropped/trimmed.

   Except extracting entire SLA_ADVERTISE sub-type or trimming the list
   of destination AS list (this is described more in Section 4), rest
   all other content MUST not be modified by any intermediate receivers
   of the message.

4.2.  BGP node not capable of processing QoS attribute

   If BGP node is not capable of processing QoS attribute, it MUST
   forward attribute message as it is received.


5.  Receiver

   Reception of and reaction to advertised messages are optional for the
   receiver.







Shah, et al.            Expires September 2, 2012              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft   BGP attribute for QoS SLA advertisement      March 2012


    As described in earlier section, while reacting to SLA advertisement
    - receiver SHOULD invalidate previous advertised SLA and then if one
      exists for advertised NLRI. If new advertised SLA update is with
      non-zero Traffic Class count, new advertised SLA SHOULD be
      installed.  If new advertised SLA update is with Traffic Class
      count 0, no action is required.

    - If advertised QoS Attribute is with flag set to indicate to drop
      this message, receiver MUST drop message if it is the last
      receiver, in the update path, this message is advertised to.

   If advertised SLA is for the next hop, in reverse path, the receiver
   can establish advertised SLA for the whole link, the link could be
   physical or virtual link, associated with the next hop.  If NLRI
   advertised in update message is not of the next hop, receiver may
   establish advertised SLA for that specific prefix list under the
   relevant link.  It is completely up to the receiver to decide for
   which prefix to accept advertised SLA and for which one to not.

5.1.  Traffic class mapping

   It is common where switching/routing method used in 2 different AS
   could be different.  For example, Provider may tunnel Customer's IP
   traffic thru MPLS cloud.  In such cases traffic class definition for
   QoS services is also different in both AS.  For the meaningful use of
   advertised SLA in such cases, receiver is required to map traffic
   class from one type to another.

   In the example given, traffic classification in Customer AS could be
   IP diffserv based whereas traffic classification in Provider AS could
   be MPLS EXP based.  Thus for advertised MPLS EXP based SLA from PE,
   CE would require to map traffic class from IP diffserv based to MPLS
   EXP type.

   There are well-defined recommendations that exist for traffic class
   mapping between two technologies.  Receiver MAY use those defined
   recommendations for traffic class mapping or MAY define its own as
   per its network Traffic Class service definition to map to advertised
   Traffic Classes.  It is completely up to the receiver how to define
   such traffic class mapping.


6.  Deployment Consideration

   Typical use-case aimed with this proposal is for Provider to
   advertise contracted SLA to Customer Edge.  SLA established between
   customer and Provider is provisioned by the provider on the PE device
   (facing Customer Edge).  This provisioning, in a form supported by



Shah, et al.            Expires September 2, 2012              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft   BGP attribute for QoS SLA advertisement      March 2012


   Provider, is advertised thru proposed BGP QoS attribute to the
   Customer Edge.  Customer may read thru advertised SLA to provision
   one on the Customer Edge link facing towards PE.

   Contracted SLA from PE to CE may be full line-rate or sub-rate of a
   link or finer granular controlled services.  SLA is not required to
   be advertised if the SLA contract is simply a physical link.  SLA
   advertise can be useful when contracted service is sub-rate of a link
   and/or if for finer granular traffic classes that are controlled.
   Like voice, video services may be capped to certain rate.

   Another use-case can be to advertise SLA among different network
   sites within one Enterprise network.  In Hub and Spoke deployments,
   Hub may define SLA for individual spokes and advertise this SLA thru
   BGP updates.

                                SLA_ADVERTISE: AS1 to AS3
                                               NLRI = AS2 tunnel address


   It very well could be possible that AS2 may first learn its SLA with
   Provider from Provider Edge it is connected to and then advertises
   same or subset of the SLA to AS3 with AS2 to AS3 tunnel's ip address
   as NLRI.

   Deployment options are not limited to involving CEs only.  For any
   contract between Provider to Provider, SLA may be advertised from one
   PE to another PE also.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP attribute.  IANA maintains the list
   of existing BGP attribute types.  Proposal is to define a new
   attribute type code for the QoS attribute.

   With the proposal, there is a list defined for Traffic Class Elements
   type and associated Service types.  IANA will be required to maintain
   list of both new types.

9.  Security Considerations

   There is a potential for mis-behaved AS to advertise wrong SLA,
   stealing identity of another AS.  This resembles to problems already
   identified and resolved, in the routing world, thru reverse path
   forwarding check.  One proposal, inline to RPF, to resolve such
   threats is to have each BGP speaker node, in the forwarding path,
   perform reverse path check on source AS.

   Since we expect these messages to originate and distributed in the
   managed network, there should not be any risks for identity theft.
   Thus reverse path check is not considered in this proposal nor have
   we considered any alternates.  Such solutions can be explored later
   if any such need.
