  TCP Loss Probe (TLP): An Algorithm for Fast Recovery of Tail Losses
               draft-dukkipati-tcpm-tcp-loss-probe-00.txt

Abstract

   Retransmission timeouts are detrimental to application latency,
   especially for short transfers such as Web transactions where
   timeouts can often take longer than all of the rest of a transaction.
   The primary cause of retransmission timeouts are lost segments at the
   tail of transactions.  This document describes an experimental
   algorithm for TCP to quickly recover lost segments at the end of
   transactions or when an entire window of data or acknowledgments are
   lost.  TCP Loss Probe (TLP) is a sender-only algorithm that allows
   the transport to recover tail losses through fast recovery as opposed
   to lengthy retransmission timeouts.  If a connection is not receiving
   any acknowledgments for a certain period of time, TLP transmits the
   last unacknowledged segment (loss probe).  In the event of a tail
   loss in the original transmissions, the acknowledgment from the loss
   probe triggers SACK/FACK based fast recovery.  TLP effectively avoids
   long timeouts and thereby improves TCP performance.

1.  Introduction

   Retransmission timeouts are detrimental to application latency,
   especially for short transfers such as Web transactions where
   timeouts can often take longer than all of the rest of a transaction.
   This document describes an experimental algorithm, TCP Loss Probe
   (TLP), to invoke fast recovery for losses that would otherwise be
   only recoverable through timeouts.

   The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has two methods for
   recovering lost segments.  First, the fast retransmit algorithm
   relies on incoming duplicate acknowledgments (ACKs), which indicate
   that the receiver is missing some data.  After a required number of
   duplicate ACKs have arrived at the sender, it retransmits the first
   unacknowledged segment and continues with a loss recovery algorithm
   such as the SACK-based loss recovery [RFC3517].  If the fast
   retransmit algorithm fails for any reason, TCP uses a retransmission
   timeout as the last resort mechanism to recover lost segments.  If an
   ACK for a given segment is not received in a certain amount of time
   called retransmission timeout (RTO), the segment is resent [RFC6298].

   Timeouts can occur in a number of situations, such as the following:

   (1) Drop tail at the end of transactions.  Example: consider a
   transfer of five segments sent on a connection that has a congestion
   window of ten.  Any degree of loss in the tail, such as segments four
   and five, will only be recovered via a timeout.

   (2) Mid-transaction loss of an entire window of data or ACKs.  Unlike
   (1) there is more data waiting to be sent.  Example: consider a
   transfer of four segments to be sent on a connection that has a
   congestion window of two.  If the sender transmits two segments and
   both are lost then the loss will only be recovered via a timeout.

   (3) Insufficient number of duplicate ACKs to trigger fast recovery at
   sender.  The early retransmit mechanism [RFC5827] addresses this
   problem in certain special circumstances, by reducing the number of
   duplicate ACKs required to trigger a fast retransmission.

   (4) An unexpectedly long round-trip time (RTT), such that the ACKs
   arrive after the RTO timer expires.  The F-RTO algorithm [RFC5682] is
   designed to detect such spurious retransmission timeouts and at least
   partially undo the consequences of such events.

   Measurements on Google Web servers show that approximately 70% of
   retransmissions for Web transfers are sent after the RTO timer
   expires, while only 30% are handled by fast recovery.  Even on
   servers exclusively serving YouTube videos, RTO based retransmissions

   account for about 46% of the retransmissions.  If the losses are
   detectable from the ACK stream (through duplicate ACKs or SACK
   blocks) then early retransmit, fast recovery and proportional rate
   reduction are effective in avoiding timeouts [IMC11PRR].  Timeout
   retransmissions that occur in recovery and disorder state (a state
   indicating that a connection has received some duplicate ACKs),
   account for just 4% of the timeout episodes.  On the other hand 96%
   of the timeout episodes occur without any preceding duplicate ACKs or
   other indication of losses at the sender [IMC11PRR].  Early
   retransmit and fast recovery have no hope of repairing losses without
   these indications.  Efficiently addressing situations that would
   cause timeouts without any prior indication of losses is a
   significant opportunity for additional improvements to loss recovery.

   To get a sense of just how long the RTOs are in relation to
   connection RTTs, following is the distribution of RTO/RTT values on
   Google Web servers. [percentile, RTO/RTT]: [50th percentile, 4.3];
   [75th percentile, 11.3]; [90th percentile, 28.9]; [95th percentile,
   53.9]; [99th percentile, 214].  Such large RTOs make a huge
   contribution to the long tail on the latency statistics of short
   flows.  Note that simply reducing the length of RTO does not address
   the latency problem for two reasons: first, it increases the chances
   of spurious retransmissions.  Second and more importantly, an RTO
   reduces TCP's congestion window to one and forces a slow start.
   Recovery of losses without relying primarily on the RTO mechanism is
   beneficial for short TCP transfers.

   The question we address in this document is: Can a TCP sender recover
   tail losses of transactions through fast recovery and thereby avoid
   lengthy retransmission timeouts?  We specify an algorithm, TCP Loss
   Probe (TLP), which sends probe segments to trigger duplicate ACKs
   with the intent of invoking fast recovery more quickly than an RTO at
   the end of a transaction.  TLP is applicable only for connections in
   Open state, wherein a sender is receiving in-sequence ACKs and has
   not detected any lost segments.  TLP can be implemented by modifying
   only the TCP sender, and does not require any TCP options or changes
   to the receiver for its operation.  For convenience, this document
   mostly refers to TCP, but the algorithms and other discussion are
   valid for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as well.

   This document is organized as follows.  Section 2 describes the basic
   Loss Probe algorithm.  Section 3 outlines an algorithm to detect the
   cases when TLP plugs a hole in the sender.  The algorithm makes the
   sender aware that a loss had occurred so it performs the appropriate
   congestion window reduction.  Section 4 discusses the interaction of
   TLP with early retransmit.  Section 5 discusses the experimental
   results with TLP on Google Web servers.  Section 6 discusses related
   work, and Section 7 discusses the security considerations.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Loss probe algorithm

   The Loss probe algorithm is designed for a sender to quickly detect
   tail losses without waiting for an RTO.  We will henceforth use tail
   loss to generally refer to either drops at the tail end of
   transactions or a loss of an entire window of data/ACKs.  TLP works
   for senders with SACK enabled and in Open state, i.e. the sender has
   so far received in-sequence ACKs with no SACK blocks.  The risk of a
   sender incurring a timeout is high when the sender has not received
   any ACKs for a certain portion of time but is unable to transmit any
   further data either because it is application limited (out of new
   data to send), receiver window (rwnd) limited, or congestion window
   (cwnd) limited.  For these circumstances, the basic idea of TLP is to
   transmit probe segments for the specific purpose of eliciting
   additional ACKs from the receiver.  The initial idea was to send some
   form of zero window probe (ZWP) with one byte of new or old data.
   The ACK from the ZWP would provide an additional opportunity for a
   SACK block to detect loss without an RTO.  Additional losses can be
   detected subsequently and repaired as SACK based fast recovery
   proceeds.  However, in practice sending a single byte of data turned
   out to be problematic to implement and more fragile than necessary.
   Instead we use a full segment to probe but have to add complexity to
   compensate for the probe itself masking losses.

   Define probe timeout (PTO) to be a timer event indicating that an ACK
   is overdue on a connection.  The PTO value is set to max(2 * SRTT,
   10ms), where SRTT is the smoothed round-trip time [RFC6298], and is
   adjusted to account for delayed ACK timer when there is only one
   outstanding segment.

   The basic version of the TLP algorithm transmits one probe segment
   after a probe timeout if the connection has outstanding
   unacknowledged data but is otherwise idle, i.e. not receiving any
   ACKs or is cwnd/rwnd/application limited.  The transmitted segment,
   aka loss probe, can be either a new segment if available and the
   receive window permits, or a retransmission of the most recently sent
   segment, i.e., the segment with the highest sequence number.  When
   there is tail loss, the ACK from the probe triggers fast recovery.
   In the absence of loss, there is no change in the congestion control
   or loss recovery state of the connection, apart from any state
   related to TLP itself.

   TLP MUST NOT be used for non-SACK connections.  SACK feedback allows
   senders to use the algorithm described in section 3 to infer whether
   any segments were lost.

2.1.  Pseudocode

   We define the terminology used in specifying the TLP algorithm:

   FlightSize: amount of outstanding data in the network as defined in
   [RFC5681].

   PTO: Probe timeout is a timer event indicating that an ACK is
   overdue.  Its value is constrained to be smaller than an RTO.

   SRTT: smoothed round-trip time computed like in [RFC6298].

   Open state: the sender has so far received in-sequence ACKs with no
   SACK blocks, and no other indications (such as retransmission
   timeout) that a loss may have occurred.

   Consecutive PTOs: back-to-back PTOs all scheduled for the same tail
   packets in a flight.  The (N+1)st PTO is scheduled after transmitting
   the probe segment for Nth PTO.

   The TLP algorithm works as follows:

   (1) Schedule PTO after transmission of new data in Open state:

    Check for conditions to schedule PTO outlined in step 2 below.
    FlightSize > 1: schedule PTO in max(2*SRTT, 10ms).
    FlightSize == 1: schedule PTO in max(2*SRTT, 1.5*SRTT+WCDelAckT).

   WCDelAckT stands for worst case delayed ACK timer.  When FlightSize
   is 1, PTO is inflated additionally by WCDelAckT time to compensate
   for a potential long delayed ACK timer at the receiver.  The
   RECOMMENDED value for WCDelAckT is 200ms.

   (2) Conditions for scheduling PTO:

   (a) Connection is in Open state.
   (b) RTO is farther than PTO.
   (c) Connection is either cwnd limited or application limited.
   (d) Number of consecutive PTOs <= 2.
   (e) Connection is SACK enabled.

   Implementations MAY use one or two consecutive PTOs.

   (3) When PTO fires:



Dukkipati, et al.       Expires January 10, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               TCP Loss Probe                    July 2012


   (a) If a new previously unsent segment exists:
       -> Transmit new segment.
       -> FlightSize += SMSS. cwnd remains unchanged.
   (b) If no new segment exists:
       -> Retransmit the last segment.
   (c) Reschedule next PTO if conditions in (2) allow.

   The reason for retransmitting the last segment in Step (b) is so that
   the ACK will carry SACK blocks and trigger either SACK-based loss
   recovery [RFC3517] or FACK-based fast recovery [FACK].

   (4) During ACK processing:

   Cancel any existing PTO.
   If conditions in (2) allow:
     -> Reschedule the PTO relative to the
        time at which the ACK is received.

   Following is an example of TLP.  All events listed are at a TCP
   sender.

   (1) Sender transmits segments 1-10: 1, 2, 3, ..., 8, 9, 10.  There is
   no more new data to transmit.  A PTO is scheduled to fire in 2 RTTs,
   after the transmission of the 10th segment.

   (2) Receives acknowledgements (ACKs) for segments 1-5; segments 6-10
   are lost and no ACKs are received.  Note that the sender
   (re)schedules its PTO timer relative to the last received ACK, which
   is the ACK for segment 5 in this case.  The sender sets the PTO
   interval using the calculation described in step (1) of the
   algorithm.

   (3) When PTO fires, sender retransmits segment 10.

   (4) After an RTT, SACK for packet 10 arrives.  The ACK also carries
   SACK holes for segments 6, 7, 8 and 9.  This triggers FACK-based
   recovery.

   (5) Connection enters fast recovery and retransmits remaining lost
   segments.


3.  Detecting recovered losses

   If the only loss was the last segment, there is the risk that the
   loss probe itself might repair the loss, effectively masking it from
   congestion control.  To avoid interfering with mandatory congestion
   control [RFC5681] it is imperative that TLP include a mechanism to



Dukkipati, et al.       Expires January 10, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               TCP Loss Probe                    July 2012


   detect when the probe might have masked a loss and to properly reduce
   the congestion window (cwnd).  An algorithm to examine subsequent
   ACKs to determine whether the original segment was lost is described
   here.

   Since it is observed that a significant fraction of the hosts that
   support SACK do not support duplicate selective acknowledgments
   (D-SACKs) [RFC2883] the TLP algorithm for detecting such lost
   segments relies only on basic RFC 2018 SACK [RFC2018].

3.1.  TLP Loss Detection: The Basic Idea

   Consider a TLP retransmission "episode" where a sender retransmits N
   consecutive TLP packets, all for the same tail packet in a flight.
   Let us say that an episode ends when the sender receives an ACK above
   the SND.NXT at the time of the episode.  We want to make sure that
   before the episode ends the sender receives N "TLP dupacks",
   indicating that all N TLP probe segments were unnecessary, so there
   was no loss/hole that needed plugging.  If the sender gets less than
   N "TLP dupacks" before the end of the episode, then probably the
   first TLP packet to arrive at the receiver plugged a hole, and only
   the remaining TLP packets that arrived at the receiver generated
   dupacks.

   Note that delayed ACKs complicate the picture, since a delayed ACK
   will imply that the sender receives one fewer ACK than would normally
   be expected.  To mitigate this complication, before sending a TLP
   loss probe retransmission, the sender should attempt to wait long
   enough that the receiver has sent any delayed ACKs that it is
   withholding.  The sender algorithm, described in section 2.1 features
   such a delay.

   If there is ACK loss or a delayed ACK, then this algorithm is
   conservative, because the sender will reduce cwnd when in fact there
   was no packet loss.  In practice this is acceptable, and potentially
   even desirable: if there is reverse path congestion then reducing
   cwnd is prudent.

3.2.  TLP Loss Detection: Algorithm Details

   (1) State

   TLPRtxOut: the number of unacknowledged TLP retransmissions in
   current TLP episode.  The connection maintains this integer counter
   that tracks the number of TLP retransmissions in the current episode
   for which we have not yet received a "TLP dupack".  The sender
   initializes the TLPRtxOut field to 0.

Internet-Draft               TCP Loss Probe                    July 2012


   TLPHighRxt: the value of SND.NXT at the time of TLP retransmission.
   The TLP sender uses TLPHighRxt to record SND.NXT at the time it
   starts doing TLP transmissions during a given TLP episode.

   (2) Initialization

   When a connection enters the ESTABLISHED state, or suffers a
   retransmission timeout, or enters fast recovery, it executes the
   following:

   TLPRtxOut = 0;
   TLPHighRxt = 0;

   (3) Upon sending a TLP retransmission:

   if (TLPRtxOut == 0)
         TLPHighRxt = SND.NXT;
   TLPRtxOut++;

   (4) Upon receiving an ACK:

   (a) Tracking ACKs

   We define a "TLP dupack" as a dupack that has all the regular
   properties of a dupack that can trigger fast retransmit, plus the ACK
   acknowledges TLPHighRxt, and the ACK carries no new SACK information
   (as noted earlier, TLP requires that the receiver supports SACK).
   This is the kind of ACK we expect to see for a TLP transmission if
   there were no losses.  More precisely, the TLP sender considers a TLP
   probe segment as acknowledged if all of the following conditions are
   met:

   (a) TLPRtxOut > 0
   (b) SEG.ACK == TLPHighRxt
   (c) the segment contains no SACK blocks for sequence ranges
       above TLPHighRxt
   (d) the ACK does not advance SND.UNA
   (e) the segment contains no data
   (f) the segment is not a window update

   If all of those conditions are met, then the sender executes the
   following:


   TLPRtxOut--;

   (b) Marking the end of a TLP episode and detecting losses




Dukkipati, et al.       Expires January 10, 2013                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               TCP Loss Probe                    July 2012


   If an incoming ACK is after TLPHighRxt, then the sender deems the TLP
   episode over.  At that time, the TLP sender executes the following:

   isLoss = (TLPRtxOut > 0);
   TLPRtxOut = 0
   if (isLoss)
    EnterRecovery();

   In other words, if the sender detects an ACK for data beyond the TLP
   loss probe retransmission then (in the absence of reordering on the
   return path of ACKs) it should have received any ACKs that will
   indicate whether the original or any loss probe retransmissions were
   lost.  If the TLPRtxOut count is still non-zero and thus indicates
   that some TLP probe segments remain unacknowledged, then the sender
   should presume that at least one segment was lost, so it should enter
   fast recovery using the proportional rate reduction algorithm
   [IMC11PRR].

   (5) Senders must only send a TLP loss probe retransmission if all the
   conditions from section 2.1 are met and the following condition also
   holds:

   (TLPRtxOut == 0) || (SND.NXT == TLPHighRxt)

   This ensures that there is at most one sequence range with
   outstanding TLP retransmissions.  The sender maintains this invariant
   so that there is at most one TLP retransmission "episode" happening
   at a time, so that the sender can use the algorithm described above
   in this section to determine when the episode is over, and thus when
   it can infer whether any data segments were lost.

   Note that this condition only limits the number of outstanding TLP
   loss probes that are retransmissions.  There may be an arbitrary
   number of outstanding unacknowledged TLP loss probes that consist of
   new, previously-unsent data, since the standard retransmission
   timeout and fast recovery algorithms are sufficient to detect losses
   of such probe segments.


4.  Discussion

   In this section we discuss two properties related to TLP.

4.1.  Unifying loss recoveries

   The existing loss recovery algorithms in TCP have a discontinuity: A
   single segment loss in the middle of a packet train can be recovered
   via fast recovery while a loss at the end of the train causes an RTO.



Dukkipati, et al.       Expires January 10, 2013               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               TCP Loss Probe                    July 2012


   Example: consider a train of segments 1-10, loss of segment five can
   be recovered quickly through fast recovery, while loss of segment ten
   can only be recovered through a timeout.  In practice, the difference
   between losses that trigger RTO versus those invoking fast recovery
   has more to do with the position of the losses as opposed to the
   intensity or magnitude of congestion at the link.

   TLP unifies the loss recovery mechanisms regardless of the position
   of a loss, so now with TLP a segment loss in the middle of a train as
   well as at the tail end can now trigger the same fast recovery
   mechanisms.

4.2.  Recovery of any N-degree tail loss

   The TLP algorithm, when combined with a variant of the early
   retransmit mechanism described below, is capable of recovering any
   tail loss for any sized flow using fast recovery.

   We propose the following enhancement to the early retransmit
   algorithm described in [RFC5827]: in addition to allowing an early
   retransmit in the scenarios described in [RFC5827], we propose to
   allow a delayed early retransmit [IMC11PRR] in the case where there
   are three outstanding segments that have not been cumulatively
   acknowledged and one segment that has been fully SACKed.

   Consider the following scenario, which illustrates an example of how
   this enhancement allows quick loss recovery in a new scenario:

   (2) TLP retransmission probe of the last (fourth) segment
   (3) the arrival of a SACK for the last segment changes
       scoreboard to: A _ _ S
   (4) early retransmit and fast recovery of the second and
       third segments

   With this enhancement to the early retransmit mechanism, then for any
   degree of N-segment tail loss we get a quick recovery mechanism
   instead of an RTO.

   Consider the following taxonomy of tail loss scenarios, and the
   ultimate outcome in each case:

   (5) >=5 L      ..LS              FACK fast recovery  all repaired


   key:
   A = ACKed segment
   L = lost segment
   S = SACKed segment

   Let us consider each tail loss scenario in more detail:

   (1) With one segment lost, the TLP loss probe itself will repair the
   loss.  In this case, the sender's TLP loss detection algorithm will
   notice that a segment was lost and repaired, and reduce its
   congestion window in response to the loss.

   (2) With two segments lost, the TLP loss probe itself is not enough
   to repair the loss.  However, when the SACK for the loss probe
   arrives at the sender, then the early retransmit mechanism described
   in [RFC5827] will note that with two segments outstanding and the
   second one SACKed, the sender should retransmit the first segment.
   This retransmit will repair the single remaining lost segment.

   (3) With three segments lost, the TLP loss probe itself is not enough
   to repair the loss.  However, when the SACK for the loss probe
   arrives at the sender, then the enhanced early retransmit mechanism
   described in this section will note that with three segments
   outstanding and the third one SACKed, the sender should retransmit
   the first segment and enter fast recovery.  The early retransmit and
   fast recovery phase will, together, repair the the remaining two lost
   segments.

   (4) With four segments lost, the TLP loss probe itself is not enough
   to repair the loss.  However, when the SACK for the loss probe
   arrives at the sender, then the FACK fast retransmit mechanism [FACK]
   will note that with four segments outstanding and the fourth one
   SACKed, the sender should retransmit the first segment and enter fast
   recovery.  The fast retransmit and fast recovery phase will,
   together, repair the the remaining two lost segments.

   (5) With five or more segments lost, events precede much as in case
   (4).  The TLP loss probe itself is not enough to repair the loss.

   However, when the SACK for the loss probe arrives at the sender, then
   the FACK fast retransmit mechanism [FACK] will note that with five or
   more segments outstanding and the segment highest in sequence space
   SACKed, the sender should retransmit the first segment and enter fast
   recovery.  The fast retransmit and fast recovery phase will,
   together, repair the remaining lost segments.

   In summary, the TLP mechanism, in conjunction with the proposed
   enhancement to the early retransmit mechanism, is able to recover
   from a tail loss of any number of segments without resort to a costly
   RTO.


5.  Experiments with TLP

   In this section we describe experiments and measurements with TLP
   performed on Google Web servers using Linux 2.6.  The experiments
   were performed over several weeks and measurements were taken across
   a wide range of Google applications.  The main goal of the
   experiments is to instrument and measure TLP's performance relative
   to the baseline.  The experiment and baseline were using the same
   kernels with an on/off switch to enable TLP.

   All experiments were conducted with the basic version of the TLP
   described in Section 2.  All other algorithms such as early
   retransmit and FACK based recovery are present in the both the
   experiment and baseline.  We have also experimented with a few
   variations of TLP such as the consecutive probe segments to transmit
   and the value that a PTO should be delayed by to take into account
   delayed ACK timer when FlightSize equals one.  The numbers reported
   below are with experiments where we did not restrict the number of
   consecutive probe segments to two.  There are three primary metrics
   we are interested in: impact on TCP latency (average and tail or 99th
   percentile latency), retransmission statistics, and the percentage of
   probe segments relative to the total number of transmitted segments.
   TCP latency is the time elapsed between the server transmitting the
   first byte of the response to it receiving an ACK for the last byte.
   The probe segments are not accounted in retransmission statistics but
   instead tracked separately in the Linux MIB.

   Over a period of a week long experiment, TLP reduced the average TCP
   latency of Google Web search and Instant search by [average:3%, 99th
   percentile:5%], Google Maps by [average:5%, 99th percentile:10%], and
   Google Images by [average:7%, 99th percentile:10%].  The varying
   percentage of improvements is because of the differences in the
   response size distribution amongst these services, e.g.  Google
   Images has the smallest response sizes and hence is more prone to
   tail segment losses.  TLP also improved performance in mobile

   networks, e.g. by 7.2% for Web search and Instant and 7.6% for Images
   transferred over Verizon network.  To see why and where the latency
   improvements are coming from, we measured the retransmission
   statistics.  We broke down the retransmission stats based on nature
   of retransmission - timeout retransmission or fast recovery.  TLP
   reduced the number of timeout retransmissions by 10% compared to the
   baseline, i.e. (timeout_retrans_tlp - timeout_retrans_baseline) /
   timeout_retrans_baseline = 10%.  This includes the retransmissions
   that occur in the slow start phase of the timeout.  There is a
   corresponding increase in the number of fast retransmits and in fast
   recovery.  Note that it is not always possible for TLP to convert
   100% of the timeouts into fast recovery episodes for two reasons:
   either a PTO was not scheduled because an RTO was closer, or a probe
   segment was sent but an RTO occurred anyway.

   The overhead of probe segments as a percentage of the total number of
   outgoing segments is 0.6%, i.e. (number of probe segments / number of
   outgoing segments)*100 = 0.6%.  When FlightSize equals 1 it is
   important to account for the delayed ACK timer in the PTO value, in
   order to bring down the number of unnecessary probe segments. (the
   WCDelAckT term, aka Worst Case delayed ACK time was set to 200ms).
   With delays of 0ms and 50ms, the percentage probe segments are 3.1%
   and 2.2% respectively.

   Besides the macro level latency and retransmission statistics, we
   also measured TCP's internal state variables at the point when PTO
   timer fires and a probe segment is transmitted.  We report a few of
   these statistics here.  We measured the number of probe segments sent
   consecutively within a single timeout period.  About 80% of the
   segments were probes sent the first time within the timeout period
   while the remaining were consecutive probes. 10% of the probe
   segments are new previously untransmitted data while the remainder
   are a retransmission of the last sent segment.

   The distribution below shows the time period, normalized by the
   connection RTT, between the PTO timer firing and the epoch when the
   next RTO is scheduled.  Note that the slack time period between a PTO
   and RTO can be several tens of RTTs, possibly because of large RTOs
   caused by variance in round-trip times.

   [normalized interval] 1.4  3.3  10.5 21   95

   The following distribution shows the FlightSize and congestion window
   values when a PTO is scheduled.  We note that cwnd is not the
   limiting factor and that nearly all of the probe segments are sent
   within the congestion window.

6.  Related work

   TCP's long and conservative RTO recovery has long been identified as
   the major performance bottleneck for latency-demanding applications.
   A well-studied example is online gaming that requires reliability and
   low latency but small bandwidth.  [GRIWODZ06] shows that repeated
   long RTO is the dominating performance bottleneck for game
   responsiveness.  The authors in [PETLUND08] propose to use linear RTO
   to improve the performance, which has been incorporated in the Linux
   kernel as a non-default socket option for such thin streams.
   [MONDAL08] further argues exponential RTO backoff should be removed
   because it is not necessary for the stability of Internet.  In
   contrast, TLP does not change the RTO timer calculation or the
   exponential back off.  TLP's approach is to keep the behavior after
   RTO conservative for stability but allows a few timely probes before
   concluding the network is badly congested and cwnd should fall to 1.
   As noted earlier in the Introduction the F-RTO [RFC5682] algorithm
   reduces the number of spurious timeout retransmissions and the Early
   Retransmit [RFC5827] mechanism reduces timeouts when a connection has
   received a certain number of duplicate ACKs.  Both are complementary
   to TLP and can work alongside.

   TCP Loss Probe is one of several algorithms designed to maximize the
   robustness of TCPs self clock in the presence of losses.  It follows
   the same principles as Proportional Rate Reduction [IMC11PRR] and TCP
   Laminar [Laminar].
