    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There are many possible rate measurement scenarios. This memo
      describes one rate measurement problem and presents a rate-measurement
      problem statement for test protocols to measure IP Performance Metrics
      (IPPM).</t>

      <t>The access-rate scenario or use case has wide-spread attention of
      Internet access subscribers and seemingly all Internet industry players,
      including regulators. This problem is being approached with many
      different measurement methods. This memo</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The scope and purpose of this memo is to define the measurement
      problem statement for test protocols conducting access rate measurement
      on production networks. Relevant test protocols include <xref
      target="RFC4656"/> and <xref target="RFC5357"/>), but the problem is
      stated in a general way so that it can be addressed by any existing test
      protocol, such as <xref target="RFC6812"/>. </t>

      <t>This memo discusses possibilities for methods of measurement, but
      does not specify exact methods which would normally be part of the
      solution, not the problem.</t>

      <t>We characterize the access rate measurement scenario as follows:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The Access portion of the network is the focus of this problem
          statement. The user typically subscribes to a service with
          bi-directional access partly described by rates in bits per second.
          The rates may be expressed as raw capacity or restricted capacity as
          described in <xref target="RFC6703"/>. These are the quantities that
          must be measured according to one or more standard metrics for which
          methods must also be agreed as a part of the solution.</t>

          <t>Referring to the reference path defined in <xref
          target="I-D.morton-ippm-lmap-path"/>, possible measurement points
          include a Subscriber's host (mp000), the access service demarcation
          point (mp100), Intra IP access where a globally routable address is
          present (mp150), or the gateway between the measured access network
          and other networks (mp190).</t>

          <t>Rates at the edge of the network are several orders of magnitude
          less than aggregation and core portions.</t>

          <t>Asymmetrical ingress and egress rates are prevalent.</t>

          <t>Extremely large scale of access services requires low complexity
          devices participating at the user end of the path.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Today, the majority of widely deployed access services achieve rates
      less than 100 Mbit/s, and this is the order of magnitude for which a
      solution is sought now.</t>

      <t>This problem statement assumes that the most-likely bottleneck device
      or link is adjacent to the remote (user-end) measurement device, or is
      within one or two router/switch hops of the remote measurement
      device.</t>

      <t>Other use cases for rate measurement involve situations where the
      packet switching and transport facilities are leased by one operator
      from another and the actual capacity available cannot be directly
      determined (e.g., from device interface utilization). These scenarios
      could include mobile backhaul, Ethernet Service access networks, and/or
      extensions of layer 2 or layer 3 networks. The results of rate
      measurements in such cases could be employed to select alternate
      routing, investigate whether capacity meets some previous agreement,
      and/or adapt the rate of traffic sources if a capacity bottleneck is
      found via the rate measurement. In the case of aggregated leased
      networks, available capacity may also be asymmetric. In these cases, the
      tester is assumed to have a sender and receiver location under their
      control. We refer to this scenario below as the aggregated leased
      network case.</t>

      <t>Support of active measurement methods will be addressed here,
      consistent with the IPPM working group's traditional charter. Active
      measurements require synthetic traffic dedicated to testing, and do not
      use user traffic.</t>

      <t>The actual path used by traffic may influence the rate measurement
      results for some forms of access, as it may differ between user and test
      traffic if the test traffic has different characteristics, primarily in
      terms of the packets themselves (the Type-P described in <xref
      target="RFC2330"/>).</t>

      <t>There are several aspects of Type-P where user traffic may be
      examined and directed to special treatment that may affect transmission
      rates. The possibilities include:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Packet length</t>

          <t>IP addresses used</t>

          <t>Transport protocol used (where TCP packets may be routed
          differently from UDP)</t>

          <t>Transport Protocol port numbers used</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This issue requires further discussion when specific
      solutions/methods of measurement are proposed, but for this problem
      statement it is sufficient to Identify the problem and indicate that the
      solution may require an extremely close emulation of user traffic, in
      terms of the factors above.</t>

      <t>Although the user may have multiple instances of network access
      available to them, the primary problem scope is to measure one form of
      access at a time. It is plausible that a solution for the single access
      problem will be applicable to simultaneous measurement of multiple
      access instances, but discussion of this is beyond the current
      scope.</t>

      <t>A key consideration is whether active measurements will be conducted
      with user traffic present (In-Service testing), or not present
      (Out-of-Service testing), such as during pre-service testing or
      maintenance that interrupts service temporarily. Out-of-Service testing
      includes activities described as "service commissioning", "service
      activation", and "planned maintenance". Opportunistic In-Service testing
      when there is no user traffic present throughout the test interval is
      essentially equivalent to Out-of-Service testing. Both In-Service and
      Out-of-Service testing are within the scope of this problem.</t>

      <t>It is a non-goal to solve the measurement protocol specification
      problem in this memo.</t>

      <t>It is a non-goal to standardize methods of measurement in this memo.
      However, the problem statement will mandate that support for one or more
      categories of rate measurement methods and adequate control features for
      the methods in the test protocol.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Active Rate Measurement">
      <t>This section lists features of active measurement methods needed to
      measure access rates in production networks.</t>

      <t>Test coordination between source and destination devices through
      control messages and other basic capabilities described in the methods
      of IPPM RFCs <xref target="RFC2679"/><xref target="RFC2680"/> are taken
      as given (these could be listed later, if desired).</t>

      <t>Most forms of active testing intrude on user performance to some
      degree. One key tenet of IPPM methods is to minimize test traffic
      effects on user traffic in the production network. Section 5 of <xref
      target="RFC2680"/> lists the problems with high measurement traffic
      rates, and the most relevant for rate measurement is the tendency for
      measurement traffic to skew the results, followed by the possibility of
      introducing congestion on the access link. Obviously, categories of rate
      measurement methods that use less active test traffic than others with
      similar accuracy SHALL be preferred for In-Service testing.</t>

      <t>On the other hand, Out-of-Service tests where the test path shares no
      links with In-Service user traffic have none of the congestion or skew
      concerns, but these tests must address other practical concerns such as
      conducting measurements within a reasonable time from the tester's point
      of view. Out-of-Service tests where some part of the test path is shared
      with In-Service traffic MUST respect the In-Service constraints.</t>

      <t>The **intended metrics to be measured** have strong influence over
      the categories of measurement methods required. For example, using the
      terminology of <xref target="RFC5136"/>, a it may be possible to measure
      a Path Capacity Metric while In-Service if the level of background
      (user) traffic can be assessed and included in the reported result.</t>

      <t>The measurement *architecture* MAY be either of one-way (e.g., <xref
      target="RFC4656"/>) or two-way (e.g., <xref target="RFC5357"/>), but the
      scale and complexity aspects of end-user or aggregated access
      measurement clearly favor two-way (with low-complexity user-end device
      and round-trip results collection, as found in <xref
      target="RFC5357"/>). However, the asymmetric rates of many access
      services mean that the measurement system MUST be able to evaluate
      performance in each direction of transmission. In the two-way
      architecture, it is expected that both end devices MUST include the
      ability to launch test streams and collect the results of measurements
      in both (one-way) directions of transmission (this requirement is
      consistent with previous protocol specifications, and it is not a unique
      problem for rate measurements).</t>

      <t>The following paragraphs describe features for the roles of test
      packet SENDER, RECEIVER, and results REPORTER.</t>

      <t>SENDER:</t>

      <t>Generate streams of test packets with various characteristics as
      desired (see Section 4). The SENDER may be located at the user end of
      the access path, or may be located elsewhere in the production network,
      such as at one end of an aggregated leased network segment.</t>

      <t>RECEIVER:</t>

      <t>Collect streams of test packets with various characteristics (as
      described above), and make the measurements necessary to support rate
      measurement at the other end of an end-user access or aggregated leased
      network segment.</t>

      <t>REPORTER:</t>

      <t>Use information from test packets and local processes to measure
      delivered packet rates.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Measurement Method Categories">
      <t>The design of rate measurement methods can be divided into two
      phases: test stream design and measurement (SENDER and RECEIVER), and a
      follow-up phase for analysis of the measurement to produce results
      (REPORTER). The measurement protocol that addresses this problem MUST
      only serve the test stream generation and measurement functions.</t>

      <t>For the purposes of this problem statement, we categorize the many
      possibilities for rate measurement stream generation as follows;<list
          style="numbers">
          <t>Packet pairs, with fixed intra-pair packet spacing and fixed or
          random time intervals between pairs in a test stream.</t>

          <t>Multiple streams of packet pairs, with a range of intra-pair
          spacing and inter-pair intervals.</t>

          <t>One or more packet ensembles in a test stream, using a fixed
          ensemble size in packets and one or more fixed intra-ensemble packet
          spacings (including zero spacing).</t>

          <t>One or more packet chirps, where intra-packet spacing typically
          decreases between adjacent packets in the same chirp and each pair
          of packets represents a rate for testing purposes.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>For all categories, the test protocol MUST support:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Variable payload lengths among packet streams</t>

          <t>Variable length (in packets) among packet streams or
          ensembles</t>

          <t>Variable IP header markings among packet streams</t>

          <t>Choice of UDP transport and variable port numbers, OR, choice of
          TCP transport and variable port numbers for two-way architectures
          only, OR BOTH.</t>

          <t>Variable number of packets-pairs, ensembles, or streams used in a
          test session</t>
        </list>The items above are additional variables that the test protocol
      MUST be able to identify and control.</t>

      <t>The test protocol SHALL support test packet ensemble generation
      (category 3), as this appears to minimize the demands on measurement
      accuracy. Other stream generation categories are OPTIONAL.</t>

      <t>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</t>

      <t>Note: For measurement systems employing TCP Transport protocol, the
      ability to generate specific stream characteristics requires a sender
      with the ability to establish and prime the connection such that the
      desired stream characteristics are allowed. See Mathis' work in progress
      for more background <xref
      target="I-D.mathis-ippm-model-based-metrics"/>. The general requirement
      statements needed to describe an "open-loop" TCP sender require some
      additional discussion.</t>

      <t>It may also be useful to specify a control for Bulk Transfer Capacity
      measurement with fully-specified TCP senders and receivers, as
      envisioned in <xref target="RFC3148"/>, but this would be a brute-force
      assessment which does not follow the conservative tenets of IPPM
      measurement <xref target="RFC2330"/>.</t>

      <t>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</t>

      <t>Measurements for each test packet transferred between SENDER and
      RECEIVER MUST be compliant with the singleton measurement methods
      described in IPPM RFCs <xref target="RFC2679"/><xref target="RFC2680"/>
      (these could be listed later, if desired). The time-stamp information or
      loss/arrival status for each packet MUST be available for communication
      to the protocol entity that collects results.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Test Protocol Control &amp; Generation Requirements">
      <t>Essentially, the test protocol MUST support the measurement features
      described in the sections above. This requires:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Communicating all test variables to the Sender and Receiver</t>

          <t>Results collection in a one-way architecture</t>

          <t>Remote device control for both one-way and two-way
          architectures</t>

          <t>Asymmetric and/or pseudo-one-way test capability in a two-way
          measurement architecture</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The ability to control packet size on the tested path and enable
      asymmetrical packet size testing in a two-way architecture are
      REQUIRED.</t>

      <t>The test protocol SHOULD enable measurement of the <xref
      target="RFC5136"/> Capacity metric, either Out-of-Service, In-Service,
      or both. Other <xref target="RFC5136"/> metrics are OPTIONAL.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
      live networks are relevant here as well. See <xref target="RFC4656"/>
      and <xref target="RFC5357"/>.</t>

      <t>There may be a serious issue if a proprietary Service Level Agreement
      involved with the access network segment provider were somehow leaked in
      the process of rate measurement. To address this, test protocols SHOULD
      NOT convey this information in a way that could be discovered by
      unauthorized parties.</t>
