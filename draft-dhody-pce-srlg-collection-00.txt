             PCEP Extensions for Receiving SRLG Information
                   draft-dhody-pce-srlg-collection-00

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path
   computation in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled
   by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS).

   This document provides extensions for the Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) to support collection of Shared Risk Link Group
   (SRLG) information during path computation and encoding this
   information in the reply message.

1.  Introduction

   As per [RFC4655], PCE based path computation model is deployed in
   large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks.  In such
   case PCEs may cooperate with each other to provide end to end optimal
   path.

   It is important to understand which TE links in the network might be
   at risk from the same failures.  In this sense, a set of links may
   constitute a 'shared risk link group' (SRLG) if they share a resource
   whose failure may affect all links in the set [RFC4202].  H-LSP
   (Hierarchical LSP) or S-LSP (Stitched LSP) can be used for carrying
   one or more other LSPs as described in [RFC4206] and [RFC6107].
   H-LSP and S-LSP may be computed by PCE(s) and further form as a TE

   link.  The SRLG information of such LSPs can be collected during path
   computation itself and encoded in the PCEP Path Computation Reply
   (PCRep) message.  [I-D.zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app] describes the use
   of PCE for end to end User-Network Interface (UNI) path computation.

   [I-D.farrel-interconnected-te-info-exchange] describes a scaling
   problem with SRLGs in multi-layer environment and introduce a concept
   of Macro SRLG.  Lower layer SRLG collection at the time of path
   computation can be used to generate such a Macro SRLG at the PCE.

   Note that [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-srlg-collect] specifies a similar
   extension to Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-
   TE) where SRLG information is collected at the time of signaling.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   CPS:  Confidential Path Segment.  A segment of a path that contains
      nodes and links that the policy requires not to be disclosed
      outside the domain.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   SRLG:  Shared Risk Link Group.

   UNI:  User-Network Interface.

3.  PCEP Requirements

   Following key requirements are identified for PCEP to enable SRLG
   information collection during path computation:

   SRLG Collection Indication:  The PCEP speaker must be capable of
      indicating whether the SRLG information of the LSP should be
      collected during the path computation procedure.

Internet-Draft                  PCE-SRLG                    October 2013


   SRLG Collection:  If requested, the SRLG information should be
      collected during the path computation and encoded in the PCRep
      message.

4.  Extension to PCEP

   This document extends the existing RP (Request Parameters) object
   [RFC5440] so that a PCEP speaker can request SRLG information
   collection during path computation.  The SRLG subobject maybe carried
   inside the Explicit Route Object (ERO) in the PCRep message.

4.1.  The Extension of the RP Object

   This document adds the following flags to the RP Object:

   S (SRLG - 1 bit):  when set, in a PCReq message, this indicates that
      the SRLG information of the Label switched path (LSP) should be
      collected during the path computation procedure.  Otherwise, when
      cleared, this indicates that the SRLG information should not be
      collected.  In a PCRep message, when the S bit is set this
      indicates that the returned path in ERO also carry the SRLG
      information; otherwise (when the S bit is cleared), the returned
      path does not carry SRLG information.

4.2.  SRLG Subobject in ERO

   As per [RFC5440], ERO is used to encode the path of a TE LSP and is
   carried within a PCRep message to provide the computed path when
   computation was successful.

   The SRLG of a path is the union of the SRLGs of the links in the LSP
   [RFC4202].  The SRLG subobject is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-srlg-collect], as shown below:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |      Type     |     Length    |  Reserved     |    Flags      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 SRLG ID 1 (4 bytes)                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   ~                           ......                              ~
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 SRLG ID n (4 bytes)                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The meaning and description of Type, Length and SRLG ID can be found
   in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-srlg-collect].  Bits in the Flags field is
   ignored.

   The SRLG subobject should be encoded inside the ERO object in the
   PCRep message when the S-Bit (SRLG) is set in the PCReq message.

5.  Other Considerations

5.1.  Backward Compatibility

   If a PCE receives a request and the PCE does not understand the new
   SRLG flag in the RP object, then the PCE SHOULD reject the request.

   If PCEP speaker receives a PCRep message with SRLG subobject that it
   does not support or recognize, it must act according to the existing
   processing rules.

5.2.  Confidentiality via PathKey

   [RFC5520] defines a mechanism to hide the contents of a segment of a
   path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS).  The CPS may be
   replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCEP and signaled
   within in a RSVP-TE ERO.

   When path-key confidentiality is used, collection of SRLG information
   and encoding this information in PCRep along with the path-key could
   be useful to compute a SRLG disjoint backup path at the later
   instance.

7.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   TBD.

7.6.  Impact On Network Operations

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA assigns values to PCEP parameters in registries defined in
   [RFC5440].  IANA is requested to make the following additional
   assignments.

8.1.  New Subobjects for the ERO Object

   IANA has previously assigned an Object-Class and Object-Type to the
   ERO carried in PCEP messages [RFC5440].  IANA also maintains a list
   of subobject types valid for inclusion in the ERO.

   IANA is requested to assign one new subobject types for inclusion in
   the ERO as follows:
