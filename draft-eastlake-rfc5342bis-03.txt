INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


1. Introduction

   Some IETF protocols use Ethernet or other [IEEE] 802 related
   communication frame formats and parameters [IEEE802].  These include
   MAC (Media Access Control) identifiers and protocol identifiers.

   This document specifies IANA considerations for the assignment of
   code points under the IANA OUI.  It also discusses some other IETF
   use of IEEE 802 code points and provides some values for use in
   documentation. As noted in [RFC2606] and [RFC5737], the use of
   designated code values reserved for documentation and examples
   reduces the likelihood of conflicts and confusion arising from their
   duplication of code points assigned for some deployed use.

   [RFC5226] is incorporated herein except where there are contrary
   provisions in this document. In this document "IESG Ratification" is
   used in some cases and it is specified in Section 5.1. This is not
   the same as "IESG Approval" in [RFC5226].



1.1 Changes from RFC 5342

   Add MAC addresses and IANA OUI-based protocol and other values for
   use in documentation and add relevant Security Considerations
   language.

   Eliminate any requirements for parallel unicast and multicast
   assignment unless requested. Such requirements had been included in
   [RFC5342] on the theory they would make bookkeeping easier for IANA
   but have proved to be problematic in practice.

   Add AFNs and RRTYPEs for 48-bit and 64-bit MACs.



1.2 Notations Used in This Document

   This document uses hexadecimal notation.  Each octet (that is, 8-bit
   byte) is represented by two hexadecimal digits giving the value of
   the octet as an unsigned integer.  Successive octets are separated by
   a hyphen.  This document consistently uses IETF bit ordering although
   the physical order of bit transmission within an octet on an IEEE
   [802.3] link is from the lowest order bit to the highest order bit
   (i.e., the reverse of the IETF's ordering).

   In this document:

   "AFN" stands for Address Family Number [RFC4760].

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   "EUI" stands for Extended Unique Identifier.

   "IAB" stands for Individual Address Block, not for Internet
         Architecture Board.

   "MAC" stands for Media Access Control, not for Message Authentication
         Code.

   "OUI" stands for Organizationally Unique Identifier.

   "RRTYPE" stands for a DNS Resource Record type [RFC6895].

   "**"  indicates exponentiation.  For example, 2**24 is two to the
         twenty-fourth power.



1.3 The IEEE Registration Authority

   Originally the responsibility of Xerox Corporation, the registration
   authority for Ethernet parameters is now the IEEE Registration
   Authority, available on the web at:

         http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/

   Anyone may apply to that Authority for parameters.  They may impose
   fees or other requirements but commonly waive fees for applications
   from standards development organizations.

   A list of some assigned OUIs and IABs and their holders is
   downloadable from the IEEE Registration Authority site.



1.4 The IANA OUI

   The OUI 00-00-5E has been assigned to IANA.

   There is no OUI value reserved at this time for documentation but
   there are documentation code points under the IANA OUI specified
   below.

2. Ethernet Identifier Parameters

   Section 2.1 discusses EUI-48 (Extended Unique Identifier 48) MAC
   identifiers, their relationship to OUIs and IABs, and assignments
   under the IANA OUI.  Section 2.2 extends this to EUI-64 identifiers.
   Section 2.3 discusses other IETF MAC identifier use not under the
   IANA OUI.



2.1 48-Bit MAC Identifiers, OUIs, and IABs

   48-bit MAC "addresses" are the most commonly used Ethernet interface
   identifiers.  Those that are globally unique are also called EUI-48
   identifiers.  An EUI-48 is structured into an initial 3-octet OUI
   (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and an additional 3 octets
   assigned by the OUI holder.  For organizations not requiring 3
   octets' worth of identifiers, the IEEE assigns IABs (Individual
   Address Blocks) instead, where the first 4 1/2 octets (36 bits) are
   assigned, giving the holder of the IAB 1 1/2 octets (12 bits) they
   can control.

   The IEEE describes its assignment procedures and policies for IEEE
   802 related identifiers in [802_O&A].

   Two bits within the initial octet of an EUI-48 have special
   significance: the Group bit (01) and the Local bit (02).  OUIs and
   IABs are assigned with the Local bit zero and the Group bit
   unspecified.  Multicast identifiers may be constructed by turning on
   the Group bit, and unicast identifiers constructed by leaving the
   Group bit zero.

   For globally unique EUI-48 identifiers assigned by an OUI or IAB
   owner, the Local bit is zero.  If the Local bit is a one, the
   identifier is considered by IEEE 802 to be a local identifier under
   the control of the local network administrator.  If the Local bit is
   on, the holder of an OUI (or IAB) has no special authority over MAC
   identifiers whose first 3 (or 4 1/2) octets correspond to their OUI
   (or IAB).

   An AFN and a DNS RRTYPE have been assigned for 48-bit MAC addresses
   (see Section 5.2).



2.1.1 EUI-48 Assignments under the IANA OUI

   The OUI 00-00-5E has been assigned to IANA as stated in Section 1.4
   above.  This includes 2**24 EUI-48 multicast identifiers from
   01-00-5E-00-00-00 to 01-00-5E-FF-FF-FF and 2**24 EUI-48 unicast

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   identifiers from 00-00-5E-00-00-00 to 00-00-5E-FF-FF-FF.

   Of these EUI-48 identifiers, the sub-blocks reserved or thus far
   assigned by IANA those for purposes of documentation, are as follows:

   Unicast, all blocks of 2**8 addresses thus far:

      00-00-5E-00-00-00 through 00-00-5E-00-00-FF: reserved and require
            IESG Ratification for assignment (see Section 5.1).

      00-00-5E-00-01-00 through 00-00-5E-00-01-FF: assigned for the
            Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC5798].

      00-00-5E-00-02-00 through 00-00-5E-00-02-FF: assigned for the IPv6
            Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP IPv6) [RFC5798].

      00-00-5E-00-52-00 through 00-00-5E-00-52-FF: being used for very
            small assignments. Currently 3 out of these 256 values have
            been assigned.

      00-00-5E-00-53-00 through 00-00-5E-00-53-FF: assigned for use in
            documentation.

   Multicast:

      01-00-5E-00-00-00 through 01-00-5E-7F-FF-FF: 2**23 addresses
            assigned for IPv4 multicast [RFC1112].

      01-00-5E-80-00-00 through 01-00-5E-8F-FF-FF: 2**20 addresses
            assigned for MPLS multicast [RFC5332].

      01-00-5E-90-00-00 through 01-00-5E-90-00-FF: 2**8 addresses being
            used for very small assignments. Currently 4 out of these
            256 values have been assigned.

      01-00-5E-90-10-00 through 01-00-5E-90-10-FF: 2**8 addresses for
            use in documentation.

   For more detailed and up-to-date information, see the Ethernet Number
   registry at http://www.iana.org.



2.1.2 EUI-48 Documentation Values

   The following values have been assigned for use in documentation:

      00-00-5E-00-53-00 through 00-00-5E-00-53-FF for unicast and

      01-00-5E-90-10-00 through 01-00-5E-90-10-FF for multicast.

2.1.3 EUI-48 IANA Assignment Considerations

   EUI-48 assignments under the current or a future IANA OUI (see
   Section 5.4) must meet the following requirements:

      o  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or
         other standard related to IETF work),

      o  must be for a block of a power-of-two identifiers starting at a
         boundary that is an equal or greater power of two, including
         the assignment of one (2**0) identifier,

      o  must not be used to evade the requirement for vendors to obtain
         their own block of identifiers from the IEEE, and

      o  must be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC.

   In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure
   in Section 5.1):

      Small to medium assignments of a block of 1, 2, 4, ..., 32768,
         65536 (2**0, 2**1, 2**2, ..., 2**15, 2**16) EUI-48 identifiers
         require Expert Review.

      Large assignments of 131072 (2**17) or more EUI-48 identifiers
         require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1).

   ([RFC5342] had a requirement for parallel unicast and multicast
   assignments under some circumstances even when both types were not
   applied for. That requirement has proven impractical and is
   eliminated in this document.)



2.2 64-Bit MAC Identifiers

   IEEE also defines a system of 64-bit MAC identifiers including
   EUI-64s.  Uptake of these "MAC-64" identifiers has been limited.
   They are currently used in a modified form to construct some IPv6
   Interface Identifiers as described below and by the following IEEE
   standards:

      o  IEEE 1394 (also known as FireWire and i.Link),

      o  IEEE 802.15.4 (also known as ZigBee).

   Adding a 5-octet (40-bit) extension to a 3-octet (24-bit) OUI or a 3
   1/2 octet (28-bit) extension to a 4 1/2 octet (36-bit) IAB forms an
   EUI-64 identifier under that OUI or IAB. (IABs are discussed in
   Section 2.1.)  As with EUI-48 identifiers, the first octet has the


D. Eastlake and J. Abley                                        [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   same Group and Local bits.

   An AFN and a DNS RRTYPE have been assigned for 64-bit MAC addresses
   (see Section 5.2).

   The discussion below is almost entirely in terms of the "Modified"
   form of EUI-64 identifiers; however, anyone assigned such an
   identifier can also use the unmodified form as a MAC identifier on
   any link that uses such 64-bit identifiers for interfaces.



2.2.1 IPv6 Use of Modified EUI-64 Identifiers

   MAC-64 identifiers are used to form the lower 64 bits of some IPv6
   addresses (Section 2.5.1 and Appendix A of [RFC4291] and Appendix A
   of [RFC5214]).  When so used, the MAC-64 is modified by inverting the
   Local/Global bit to form an IETF "Modified EUI-64 identifier".  Below
   is an illustration of a Modified EUI-64 unicast identifier under the
   IANA OUI, where aa-bb-cc-dd-ee is the extension.

         02-00-5E-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee

   The first octet is shown as 02 rather than 00 because, in Modified
   EUI-64 identifiers, the sense of the Local/Global bit is inverted
   compared with EUI-48 identifiers.  It is the globally unique values
   (universal scope) that have the 02 bit on in the first octet, while
   those with this bit off are locally assigned and out of scope for
   global assignment.

   The Local/Global bit was inverted to make it easier for network
   operators to type in local-scope identifiers.  Thus, such Modified
   EUI-64 identifiers as 1, 2, etc.  (ignoring leading zeros), are
   local.  Without the modification, they would have to be
   02-00-00-00-00-00-00-01, 02-00-00-00-00-00-00-02, etc., to be local.

   As with MAC-48 identifiers, the 01 bit on in the first octet
   indicates a group identifier.

   When the first two octets of the extension of a Modified EUI-64
   identifier are FF-FE, the remainder of the extension is a 24-bit
   value as assigned by the OUI owner for an EUI-48.  For example:

         02-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy
   or
         03-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy

   where yy-yy-yy is the portion (of an EUI-48 global unicast or
   multicast identifier) that is assigned by the OUI owner (IANA in this
   case).  Thus, any holder of one or more EUI-48 identifiers under the


D. Eastlake and J. Abley                                        [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   IANA OUI also has an equal number of Modified EUI-64 identifiers that
   can be formed by inserting FF-FE in the middle of their EUI-48
   identifiers and inverting the Local/Global bit.

      (Note: [EUI-64] defines FF-FF as the bits to be inserted to create
      an IEEE EUI-64 identifier from a MAC-48 identifier.  That document
      says the FF-FE value is used when starting with an EUI-48
      identifier.  The IETF uses only FF-FE to create Modified EUI-64
      identifiers from 48-bit Ethernet station identifiers regardless of
      whether they are EUI-48 or MAC-48 local identifiers.  EUI-48 and
      local MAC-48 identifiers are syntactically equivalent, and this
      doesn't cause any problems in practice.)

   In addition, certain Modified EUI-64 identifiers under the IANA OUI
   are reserved for holders of IPv4 addresses as follows:

         02-00-5E-FE-xx-xx-xx-xx

   where xx-xx-xx-xx is a 32-bit IPv4 address. The owner of an IPv4
   address has both the unicast and multicast derived EUI-64 bit
   address.  Modified EUI-64 identifiers from

         02-00-5E-FE-F0-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FE-FF-FF-FF-FF

   are effectively reserved pending the specification of IPv4 Class E
   addresses.  However, for Modified EUI-64 identifiers based on an IPv4
   address, the Local/Global bit should be set to correspond to whether
   the IPv4 address is local or global.  (Keep in mind that the sense of
   the Modified EUI-64 identifier Local/Global bit is reversed from that
   in (unmodified) MAC-64 identifiers.)



2.2.2 EUI-64 IANA Assignment Considerations

   The following table shows which Modified EUI-64 identifiers under the
   IANA OUI are reserved, assigned, or available as indicated. As noted
   above, the corresponding MAC addresses can be determined by
   complementing the 02 bit in the first octet.  In all cases, the
   corresponding multicast 64-bit MAC addresses formed by complementing
   the 01 bit in the first octet have the same status as the modified
   64-bit unicast address blocks listed below.

      02-00-5E-00-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-0F-FF-FF-FF-FF reserved

      02-00-5E-10-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-10-00-00-00-FF assigned for
            documentation use

      02-00-5E-EF-10-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-EF-FF-FF-FF-FF, which is
            available for assignment

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


      02-00-5E-F0-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FD-FF-FF-FF-FF reserved

      02-00-5E-FE-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FE-FF-FF-FF-FF assigned to
            IPv4 address holders as described above

      02-00-5E-FF-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FF-FD-FF-FF-FF reserved

      02-00-5E-FF-FE-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FF-FE-FF-FF-FF assigned for
            holders of EUI-48 identifiers under the IANA OUI as
            described above

      02-00-5E-FF-FF-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF reserved

   The reserved identifiers above require IESG Ratification (see Section
   5.1) for assignment.  IANA EUI-64 identifier assignments under the
   IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:

      o  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or
         other standard related to IETF work),

      o  must be for a block of a power-of-two identifiers starting at a
         boundary that is an equal or greater power of two, including
         the assignment of one (2**0) identifier,

      o  must not be used to evade the requirement for vendors to obtain
         their own block of identifiers from the IEEE, and

      o  must be documented in an Internet Draft or RFC.

   In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure
   in Section 5.1):

      Small to medium assignments of a block of 1, 2, 4, ..., 134217728,
         268435456 (2**0, 2**1, 2**2, ..., 2**27, 2**28) EUI-64
         identifiers require Expert Review.

      Assignments of any size, including 536870912 (2**29) or more
         EUI-64 identifiers, may be made with IESG Ratification (see
         Section 5.1).



2.2.3 EUI-64 Documentation Values

   The following blocks of unmodified 64-bit MAC addresses are for
   documentation use. The IPv4 derived addresses are based on the IPv4
   documentation addresses [RFC5737] and the MAC derived addresses are
   based on the EUI-48 documentation addresses above.

2.3 Other MAC-48 Identifiers Used by IETF

   There are two other blocks of MAC-48 identifiers that are used by the
   IETF as described below.



2.3.1 Identifiers Prefixed 33-33

   All MAC-48 multicast identifiers prefixed "33-33" (that is, the 2**32
   multicast MAC identifiers in the range from 33-33-00-00-00-00 to
   33-33-FF-FF-FF-FF) are used by the IETF for global IPv6 multicast
   [RFC2464].  In all these identifiers, the Group bit (the bottom bit
   of the first octet) is on, as is required to work properly with
   existing hardware as a multicast identifier.  They also have the
   Local bit on and are used for this purpose in IPv6 networks.

      (Historical note: It was the custom during IPv6 design to use "3"
      for unknown or example values, and 3333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo
      Alto, California, is the address of PARC (Palo Alto Research


D. Eastlake and J. Abley                                       [Page 11]

      Center, formerly "Xerox PARC").  Ethernet was originally specified
      by Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel Corporation, and Xerox
      Corporation.  The pre IEEE [802.3] Ethernet protocol has sometimes
      been known as "DIX" Ethernet from the first letters of the names
      of these companies.)



2.3.2 The 'CF Series'

   The Informational [RFC2153] declared the 3-octet values from CF-00-00
   through CF-FF-FF to be OUIs available for assignment by IANA to
   software vendors for use in PPP [RFC1661] or for other uses where
   vendors do not otherwise need an IEEE-assigned OUI.  It should be
   noted that, when used as MAC-48 prefixes, these values have the Local
   and Group bits on, while all IEEE-assigned OUIs thus far have those
   bits off.  The Group bit is meaningless in PPP.  To quote [RFC2153]:
   "The 'CF0000' series was arbitrarily chosen to match the PPP NLPID
   'CF', as a matter of mnemonic convenience."

      CF-00-00 is reserved, and IANA lists multicast identifier
         CF-00-00-00-00-00 as used for Ethernet loopback tests.

   In over a decade of availability, only a handful of values in the 'CF
   Series' have been assigned.  (See http://www.iana.org under both
   Ethernet Parameters and PPP Parameters.)



2.3.2.1 Changes to RFC 2153

   The IANA Considerations in [RFC2153] are updated as follows (no
   technical changes are made): Use of these identifiers based on IANA
   assignment is deprecated.  IANA is directed not to assign any further
   values in the 'CF Series'.

3. Ethernet Protocol Parameters

   Ethernet protocol parameters provide a means of indicating the
   contents of a frame -- for example, that its contents are IPv4 or
   IPv6.

   The concept has been extended to labeling by "tags".  A tag in this
   sense is a prefix whose type is identified by an Ethertype that is
   then followed by either another tag, an Ethertype, or an LSAP
   protocol indicator for the "main" body of the frame, as described
   below.  Traditionally in the [802_O&A] world, tags are fixed length
   and do not include any encoding of their own length.  Any device that
   is processing a frame cannot, in general, safely process anything in
   the frame past an Ethertype it does not understand.  An example is
   the C-tag (formerly the Q-tag) [802.1Q].  It provides customer VLAN
   and priority information for a frame.

   There are two types of protocol identifier parameters that can occur
   in Ethernet frames after the initial MAC-48 destination and source
   identifiers:

      Ethertypes: These are 16-bit identifiers appearing as the initial
         two octets after the MAC destination and source (or after a
         tag) which, when considered as an unsigned integer, are equal
         to or larger than 0x0600.

      LSAPs: These are 8-bit protocol identifiers that occur in pairs
         immediately after an initial 16-bit (two octet) remaining frame
         length, which is in turn after the MAC destination and source
         (or after a tag).  Such a length must, when considered as an
         unsigned integer, be less than 0x5DC or it could be mistaken as
         an Ethertype.  LSAPs (Link-Layer Subnet Access Points) occur in
         pairs where one is intended to indicate the source protocol
         handler and one the destination protocol handler; however, use
         cases where the two are different have been relatively rare.

   Neither Ethertypes nor LSAPs are assigned by IANA; they are assigned
   by the IEEE Registration Authority (see Section 1.3 above and the
   Ethertype Annex below).  However, both LSAPs and Ethertypes have
   extension mechanisms so that they can be used with five-octet
   Ethernet protocol identifiers under an OUI, including those assigned
   by IANA under the IANA OUI.

   When using the IEEE 802 LLC format (SNAP) [802_O&A] for a frame, an
   OUI-based protocol identifier can be expressed as follows:

         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz

   where xx-xx is the frame length and, as above, must be small enough
   not to be confused with an Ethertype; "AA" is the LSAP that indicates


D. Eastlake and J. Abley                                       [Page 13]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   this use and is sometimes referred to as the SNAP SAP; "03" is the
   LLC control octet indicating datagram service; yy-yy-yy is an OUI;
   and zz-zz is a protocol number, under that OUI, assigned by the OUI
   owner.  The odd five-octet length for such OUI-based protocol
   identifiers was chosen so that, with the LLC control octet ("03"),
   the result is 16-bit aligned.

   When using an Ethertype to indicate the main type for a frame body,
   the special "OUI Extended Ethertype" 88-B7 is available.  Using this
   Ethertype, a frame body can begin with

         88-B7-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz

   where yy-yy-yy and zz-zz have the same meaning as in the SNAP format
   described above.

   It is also possible, within the SNAP format, to use an arbitrary
   Ethertype.  Putting the Ethertype as the zz-zz field after an all
   zeros OUI (00-00-00) does this.  It looks like

         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-00-zz-zz

   where zz-zz is the Ethertype.

   (Note that, at this point, the 802 protocol syntax facilities are
   sufficiently powerful that they could be chained indefinitely.
   Whether support for such chaining is generally required is not clear,
   but [802_O&A] requires support for

         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-00-88-B7-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz

   although this could be more efficiently expressed by simply pinching
   out the "00-00-00-88-B7" in the middle.)

   As well as labeling frame contents, 802 Protocol types appear within
   NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) Next Hop Resolution Protocol
   [RFC2332] messages.  Such messages have provisions for both two octet
   Ethertypes and OUI based protocol types.



3.1 Ethernet Protocol Assignment under the IANA OUI

   Two-octet protocol numbers under the IANA OUI are available, as in

         xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-5E-qq-qq

   where qq-qq is the protocol number.

   A number of such assignments have been made out of the 2**16 protocol


D. Eastlake and J. Abley                                       [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


   numbers available from 00-00-5E-00-00 to 00-00-5E-FF-FF (see [IANA]).
   The extreme values of this range, 00-00-5E-00-00 and 00-00-5E-FF-FF,
   are reserved and require IESG Ratification for assignment (see
   Section 5.1).  New assignments of SNAP SAP protocol (qq-qq) numbers
   under the IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:

      o  the assignment must be for standards use (either for an IETF
         Standard or other standard related to IETF work),

      o  it must be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC, and

      o  such protocol numbers are not to be assigned for any protocol
         that has an Ethertype (because that can be expressed by putting
         an all zeros "OUI" before the Ethertype as described above).

   In addition, the Expert Review (or IESG Ratification for the two
   reserved values) must be obtained using the procedure specified in
   Section 5.1.



3.2 Documentation Protocol Number

   00-42 is a protocol number under the IANA OUI (that is,
   00-00-0E-00-42) to be used for documentation purposes.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


4. Other OUI-Based Parameters

   Some IEEE 802 and other protocols provide for parameters based on an
   OUI beyond those discussed above.  Such parameters most commonly
   consist of an OUI plus one octet of additional value.  They are
   usually called "vendor specific" parameters, although "organization
   specific" might be more accurate.  They would look like

         yy-yy-yy-zz

   where yy-yy-yy is the OUI and zz is the additional specifier.  An
   example is the Cipher Suite Selector in IEEE [802.11].

   Values may be assigned under the IANA OUI for such other OUI-based
   parameter usage by Expert Review except that, for each use, the
   additional specifier values consisting of all zero bits and all one
   bits (0x00 (00-00-5E-00) and 0xFF (00-00-5E-FF) for a one-octet
   specifier) are reserved and require IESG Ratification (see Section
   5.1) for assignment; also, the additional specifier value 0x42
   (00-00-5E-42) is assigned for use in documentation.

   Assignments of such other IANA OUI-based parameters must be for
   standards use (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related
   to IETF work) and be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC.  The
   first time a value is assigned for a particular parameter of this
   type, an IANA registry will be created to contain that assignment and
   any subsequent assignments of values for that parameter under the
   IANA OUI.  The Expert will specify the name of the registry.

   If different policies from those above are required for such a
   parameter, a BCP or Standards Track RFC must be adopted updating this
   BCP and specifying the new policy and parameter.

5. IANA Considerations

   The entirety of this document concerns IANA Considerations for the
   assignment of Ethernet parameters in connection with the IANA OUI and
   related matters.

   As this document replaces [RFC5342], references to [RFC5342] in IANA
   registries should be replaced by references to this document. In
   addition, any references in the registries to draft-jabley-
   eui48-eui64-doc-addr, which has been combined into this document,
   should be replaced with references to this document.

   This document does not create any new IANA registries.

   This document assigns MAC address values for documentation but those
   values are already in the appropriate IANA tables due to draft-
   jabley-eui48-eui64-doc-addr. The only other assignment made by this
   document is a protocol number for documentation in Section 5.6.

   No existing assignment is changed by this document.



5.1 Expert Review and IESG Ratification

   This section specifies the procedure for Expert Review and IESG
   Ratification of MAC, protocol, and other IANA OUI-based identifiers.
   The Expert(s) referred to in this document shall consist of one or
   more persons appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the IESG.
   The procedure described for Expert Review assignments in this
   document is fully consistent with the IANA Expert Review policy
   described in Section 4.1 of [RFC5226].

   While finite, the universe of code points from which Expert judged
   assignments will be made is felt to be large enough that the
   requirements given in this document and the Experts' good judgment
   are sufficient guidance.  The idea is for the Expert to provide a
   light sanity check for small assignments of EUI identifiers with
   increased scrutiny by the Expert for medium-sized assignments of EUI
   identifiers, and assignments of protocol identifiers and other IANA
   OUI based parameters.  However, it can make sense to assign very
   large portions of the MAC identifier code point space.  (Note that
   existing assignments include one for 1/2 of the entire multicast IANA
   EUI-48 code point space and one for 1/16 of that multicast code point
   space.)  In those cases, and in cases of the assignment of "reserved"
   values, IESG Ratification of an Expert Review approval recommendation
   is required as described below.  The procedure is as follows:

      The applicant always completes the appropriate Template from the
         Template Annex below and sends it to IANA <iana@iana.org>.


D. Eastlake and J. Abley                                       [Page 17]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


      IANA always sends the Template to an appointed Expert.  If the
         Expert recuses themselves or is non-responsive, IANA may choose
         an alternative appointed Expert or, if none are available, will
         contact the IESG.

      In all case, if IANA receives a disapproval from an Expert
         selected to review an application Template, the application
         will be denied.

      If the assignment is based on Expert Review:

            If IANA receives approval and code points are available,
            IANA will make the requested assignment.

      If the assignment is based on IESG Ratification:

            The procedure starts with the first steps above for Expert
            Review. If the Expert disapproves the application, they
            simply inform IANA; however, if the Expert believes the
            application should be approved, or is uncertain and believes
            that the circumstances warrant the attention of the IESG,
            the Expert will inform IANA about their advice and IANA will
            forward the application, together with the reasons for
            approval or uncertainty, to the IESG.  The IESG must decide
            whether the assignment will be granted.  This can be
            accomplished by a management item in an IESG telechat as
            done for other types of requests.  If the IESG decides not
            to ratify a favorable opinion by the Expert or decides
            against an application where the Expert is uncertain, the
            application is denied, otherwise it is granted.  The IESG
            will communicate its decision to the Expert and to IANA.



5.2 MAC Address AFNs and RRTYPEs

   IANA has assigned AFNs for MAC addresses as follows:

            AFN         Decimal      Hex
         ----------     -------     ------
         48-bit MAC      16389      0x4005
         64-bit MAC      16390      0x4006

   IANA has assigned DNS RRTYPEs [RFC6895] for MAC addresses as follows:

                                   RRTYPE Code
            Data       Menmonic   Decimal   Hex
         ----------    --------   -------  ------
         48-bit MAC     EUI48       108    0x006C
         64-bit MAC     EUI64       109    0x006D

INTERNET-DRAFT                         IANA/IETF and IEEE 802 Parameters


5.3 Informational IANA Web Page Material

   IANA also maintains an informational listing on its web site
   concerning Ethertypes, OUIs, and multicast addresses assigned under
   OUIs other than the IANA OUI.  The title of this information registry
   is "IEEE 802 Numbers". IANA shall update that list when changes are
   provided by the Expert.



5.4 OUI Exhaustion

   When the available space for either multicast or unicast EUI-48
   identifiers under OUI 00-00-5E have been 90% or more exhausted, IANA
   should request an additional OUI from the IEEE Registration Authority
   for further IANA assignment use. The appointed Expert(s) should
   monitor for this condition and notify IANA.

   The preceding paragraph should be included in the IANA Registry as a
   Note.



5.5 IANA OUI MAC Address Table

   No changes are required in the "IANA Unicast 48-bit MAC Addresses"
   and "IANA Multicast 48-bit MAC Addresses" tables except for the
   updates to references specified in the first part of Section 5.

   The Note preceeding the "IANA 64-bit MAC Addresses" table should be
   as follows:

      "These values are prefixed with 00-00-0E to form unicast MAC
      addresses, with 01-00-0E to form multicast MAC addresses, with
      02-00-0E to form unicast modified EUI-64 addresses, and with
      03-00-0E to form multicast modified EUI-64 addresses. See [this
      document] for more details."



5.6 SNAP Protocol Number Table and Assignment

   The "SNAP PROTOCOL IDs" table is renamed the "SNAP Protocol Numbers"
   table. The Note for that table is changed by replacing "PID" with
   "protocol number".

   IANA will assign 00-42 as the SNAP protocol number under the IANA OUI
   to be used for documentation purposes.

6. Security Considerations

   This document is concerned with assignment of parameters under the
   IANA OUI and closely related matters.  It is not directly concerned
   with security except as follows:

   Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of MAC addresses or
   other OUI derived protocol parameters as examples in documentation.
   Examples used "only" in documentation can end up being coded and
   released or cause conflicts due to later real use and the possible
   acquisition of intellectual property rights in such addresses or
   parameters. The reservation herein of MAC addresses and parameters
   for documentation purposes will minimize such confusion and conflict.

   See [EUIRRTYPE] for security considerations in storing MAC addresses
   in the DNS.
