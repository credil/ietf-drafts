     Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Option for Port Set
                               Assignment
                    draft-sun-dhc-port-set-option-00

Abstract

   Because of the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space, several
   techniques have been proposed to share the same IPv4 address among
   several uses.  As an alternative to introducing a level of NAT in the
   provider's core network, this document provides a mechanism to assign
   non-overlapping port set to users assigned with the same IPv4
   address: Port Set DHCPv4 Option.

Internet-Draft          DHCP Option for Port Set            October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Currently some large ISPs still have a large enough IPv4 address pool
   to be able to allocate public IPv4 addresses for their subscribers.
   However, due to the exhaustion of the global IPv4 address space,
   these ISP expect the situation is unsustainable and they will not be
   able anymore to assign to every requesting host a public IPv4
   address.

   Two solutions have been proposed so far: (1) Deploy Network Address
   Translation (NAT) or (2) Allocate the same public IPv4 address with
   non-overlapped port sets directly to multiple connected devices
   (which can be CPEs or end hosts).  This document focuses on the
   second solution.

   This document describes a new DHCPv4 option which allows the DHCPv4
   server to assign a set of ports to a user device during the IPv4
   address provisioning process.  By assigning the same IPv4 address
   with non-overlaped port sets to multiple clients, the clients can
   share the IPv4 address and continue to deliver IPv4 services to
   subscribers.

   The Port Set Option described in this document can be used in various
   deployment scenarios, some of which are described in [RFC6346]

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.1.  Port Set Option Format

   The format of Port Set Option is shown in Figure 1.

   o  option-code: OPTION_PORT_SET (TBD)

   o  option-length: An 8-bit field indicating the length of the option
      excluding the 'Option Code' and the 'Option Length' fields.  In
      this option, the option-length is 4 octets.

   o  Port Set Index: Port Set Index identifies a set of ports assigned
      to a device.  The first k bits on the left of the 2-octet field is
      the Port Set Index value, with the rest of the field right padding
      zeros.

   o  Port Set Mask: Port Set Mask indicates the position of the bits
      used to build the mask.  The first k bits on the left is padding
      ones while the remained (16-k) bits of the 2-octet field on the
      right is padding zeros.

   In the context of Port Set Option, the port number should consist of
   port set prefix and port number suffix.  The port set prefix can be
   got from Port Set Index and Port Set Mask, while port number suffix
   can change continuously.  The format of port number is shown in
   Figure 2.

           0                                                    15
           +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
           |    port set prefix    |      port number suffix     |
           +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
           |<-------k bits-------->|<--------(16-k) bits-------->|

   Figure 2 Bit Representation of a port number

   In order to exclude the system ports ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports]) or
   ports saved by SPs, the former port-sets that contains well-known
   ports SHOULD NOT be assigned.

   For example: If k is 10 (the left 10 bits of Port Set Mask is '1'),
   the first 16 port sets is located in well-known port space, which
   should not be allocated.  Or,

   For example: If k is 4 (the left 4 bits of Port Set Mask is '1'), the
   first port set (0 - 4095) contains the well-know port space.  It
   should be perceived as well.

3.2.  Port Set Option Example

   The Port Set Option is used to specify one contiguous port set
   pertaining to the given IP address.

   Concretely, this option is used to notify a remote DHCP client about



Sun, et al.              Expires April 10, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          DHCP Option for Port Set            October 2012


   the port set prefix to be applied when selecting a port value as a
   source port.  The Port Set Option is used to infer a set of allowed
   contiguous port values.  Two port numbers are said to belong to the
   same Port Set if and only if, they have the same port set prefix.

   The following Port Set Index and Port Set Mask are conveyed using
   DHCP to assign a contiguous port set with excluding well-know ports
   (with Port Set Index not zero):

   Port Set Index: 0001 0100 0000 0000 (5120)

   Port Set Mask: 1111 1100 0000 0000 (64512)

   The device will get a contiguous port set: 5120 - 6143

4.  Server Behavior

   The server will not reply with the option until the client has
   explicitly listed the option code in the Parameter Request List
   (Option 55).

   Server MUST reply with Port Set Option if the client requested
   OPTION_PORT_SET in its Parameter Request List.  The server MUST run
   an address & port-set pool which plays the same role as address pool
   in regular DHCP server.  The address and port-set pool MUST follow
   the Port-Mask-format port-set.

   The port-set assignment SHOULD be coupled with the address assignment
   process.  Therefore server SHOULD assign the address and port set in
   the same DHCP messages.  And the lease information for the address is
   applicable to the port-set as well.

5.  Client Behavior

   The DHCP client applying for the a port-set MUST include either the
   OPTION_PORT_SET code in the Parameter Request List (Option 55).  The
   client will retrieve a Port Set Option and use the Port Set Index and
   Port Set Mask to perform the port mask algorithm to get the
   contiguous port set.  The client renews or releases the DHCP lease
   with the port set.

6.  DHCP Unicast Considerations

   DHCP messages could be unicasted over UDP port 67.  In the context of
   address sharing, not all the ports are available to the clients.  The
   server cannot use unicast to send the DHCP message to a client which
   originated the DHCP request.  To mitigate this problem, we propose to
   use the broadcast address (0.0.0.0) when the server replies to the

Internet-Draft          DHCP Option for Port Set            October 2012


   client.  Broadcast address is special and won't be assigned to any
   client.

6.1.  Server Behavior

   DHCP server MUST set broadcast bit of the 'flags' field in DHCP
   messages (Figure 2 of [RFC2131]) when allocating port sets.  And DHCP
   server MUST NOT unicast responses to DHCP client.  In order to
   identify the DHCP responses are sent to which client, client
   identifier [I-D.ietf-dhc-client-id] is used.  DHCP server MUST return
   client identifier.

6.2.  Client Behavior

   DHCP client MUST validate client identifier, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-client-id].  DHCP client MUST NOT unicast requests to
   server: all requests are broadcast.  This includes lease renewals.
   In the case of DHCP relay agent, it will broadcast the server
   responses to clients.

   In some deployment scenarios, DHCP messages containing the proposed
   DHCP option can be conveyed by other forwarding carrier than IPv4,
   saying IPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6], etc.  The server has to
   manage to forward DHCP responses to right client.

7.  Security Consideration

7.1.  Denial-of-Service

   The solution is generally vulnerable to DoS when used in shared
   medium or when access network authentication is not a prerequisite to
   IP address assignment.  The solution SHOULD only be used on point-to-
   point links, tunnels, and/or in environments where authentication at
   link layer is performed before IP address assignment, and not shared
   medium.

7.2.  Port Randomization

   Preserving port randomization [RFC6056] may be more or less difficult
   depending on the address sharing ratio (i.e., the size of the port
   space assigned to a CPE).  The host can only randomize the ports
   inside a fixed port range [RFC6269].

   More discussion to improve the robustness of TCP against Blind In-
   Window Attacks can be found at [RFC5961].  Other means than the
   (IPv4) source port randomization to provide protection against
   attacks should be used (e.g., use [I-D.vixie-dnsext-dns0x20] to
   protect against DNS attacks, [RFC5961] to improve the robustness of

   TCP against Blind In-Window Attacks, use IPv6).

   A proposal to preserve the entropy when selecting port is discussed
   in [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign]

8.  IANA Consideration

   IANA is kindly requested to allocate DHCP option code to the
   OPTION_PORT_SET.  The code should be added to the DHCP option code
   space.
