1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   This new block type supports reporting of Initial synchronization
   Delay to establish multimedia session.  Information is recorded about
   time difference between the start of RTP sessions and the time the
   RTP receiver acquires all components of RTP sessions in the
   multimedia session [RFC6051].

   It also supports reporting of the relative Synchronization offset
   time of two arbitrary streams (e.g., between audio and video
   streams), with the same RTCP CNAME included in RTCP SDES packets
   [RFC3550].  Information is recorded about the synchronization offset
   time of each RTP stream relative to the reference RTP stream with the
   same CNAME and General Synchronization Offset of zero.

   These metrics belong to the class of terminal related transport level
   metrics defined in [MONARCH].


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Synchronization offset:

      The time difference of the actual delay of the measured RTP stream
      relative to the expected delay of the reference RTP stream with
      the same CNAME.



3.  Applicability

   The report blocks defined in this document could be used by dedicated
   network monitoring applications.

   When joining each session in layered video sessions [RFC6190] or the
   multimedia sessions, a receiver may not synchronize playout across
   the multimedia sessions or layered video sessions until RTCP SR

   packets have been received on all the components of RTP sessions.
   The components of RTP sessions are referred to as each RTP stream for
   each media type in multimedia sessions or each RTP stream at each
   layer in the layered video sessions.  For unicast session, the delay
   due to negotiation of NAT pinholes, firewall holes, quality-of-
   service, and media security keys is contributed to such initial
   synchronization playout.  For multicast session, such initial
   synchronization delay varies with the session bandwidth,the number of
   members, and the number of senders in the session.  The RTP flow
   Initial synchronization delay block can be used to report the initial
   synchronization delay to receive all the RTP streams belonging to the
   same multimedia session or layered video session. beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  In the
   absence of packet loss, the initial synchronization delay equals to
   the average time taken to receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP
   session with the longest RTCP reporting interval.  In the presence of
   packet loss, the media synchronization needs to based on the in-band
   mapping of RTP and NTP- format timestamps [RFC6051] or wait until the
   reporting interval has passed, and the next RTCP SR packet is sent.

   In an RTP multimedia session, there can be an arbitrary number of
   streams carried in different RTP streams, with the same RTCP CNAME.
   These streams may be not synchronized with each other.  For example,
   one audio stream and one video stream belong to the same session and
   audio stream are transmitted lag behind video stream for multiple
   tens of milliseconds.  The RTP Flows General Synchronization Offset
   block can be used to report such synchronization offset between video
   stream and audio stream.


4.  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block

   This block is sent by RTP receivers and reports Initial
   synchronization delay beyond the information carried in the standard
   RTCP packet format.  Information is recorded about time difference
   between the start of RTP sessions and the time the RTP receiver
   acquires all components of RTP sessions [RFC6051].

4.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block has the
   following format:

4.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow Initial Synchronization Delay
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The Statistics Summary Report Block is identified by the constant
      <RFISD>.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the media source SHALL be set to the value of the SSRC
      identifier carried in the arbitrary RTP stream belonging to the
      same multimedia session.

   Initial Synchronization Delay: 32 bits

      The average delay, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, between
      the RTCP packets received on all of the components RTP sessions
      and the beginning of session [RFC6051].  The value is calculated
      based on the information contained in RTCP SR packets or the in-
      band mapping of RTP and NTP- format timestamps [RFC6051].  If
      there is no packet loss, the initial synchronisation delay is
      expected to be equal to the average time taken to receive the
      first RTCP packet in the RTP session with the longest RTCP
      reporting interval.


5.  RTP Flows General Synchronization Offset Metrics Block

   In the RTP multimedia sessions, there can be an arbitrary number of
   streams and each stream (e.g., audio stream or video stream) is sent
   in a separate RTP stream.  The receiver associates RTP streams to be
   synchronised by means of RTCP CNAME contained in the RTCP Source

   Description (SDES) packets [RFC3550].

   This block is sent by RTP receivers and reports the general
   synchronization offset time of these RTP streams to be synchronized.
   Information is recorded about the time difference of the actual delay
   of the measured RTP stream relative to the expected delay of the
   reference RTP stream with the same CNAME.  The expected delay of the
   reference RTP stream can be chosen as the first stream delay or the
   average delay of all the streams in the same session according to the
   similar rule defined in section 6.2.2.1 of [Y.1540].

5.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block has the
   following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

5.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block is
      identified by the constant <RFGSO>.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks                 April 2012


   General synchronization offset: 32 bits

      This field represents the synchronization offset time of one RTP
      stream in milliseconds relative to the reference RTP stream with
      the same CNAME and General Synchronisation Offset of zero
      [RFC6051].  This value is calculated based on the interarrival
      time between an arbitrary RTP packet and the reference RTP packet
      with the same CNAME, and timestamps of this arbitrary RTP packet
      and the reference RTP packet with the same CNAME.


6.  SDP Signaling

   Two new parameters are defined for the two report blocks defined in
   this document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].
   They have the following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute
   [RFC3611]:

        rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                          [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
             xr-format = RTP-flows-init-syn
                       / RTP-flows-general-syn
              RTP-flows-init-syn = "RTP-flows-init-syn"
                              ["=" max-size]
              RTP-flow-general-syn = "RTP-flows-general-syn"
                                ["=" max-size]
              max-size = 1*DIGIT ; maximum block size in octets

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


7.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns two new block type values in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:

      Name:       RFISD
      Long Name:  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay
