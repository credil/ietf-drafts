1.  Introduction

   This document describes an architecture for the creation of Service
   Function Chains.  It includes architectural concepts, principles, and
   components used for the application of services in a network.

1.1.  Scope

   The architecture described herein is assumed to be applicable to a
   single network administrative domain.  While it is possible for the
   principals and architectural components to be applied to inter-domain
   service function chains, these are left for future study.

1.2.  Definition of Terms

   Classification:  Locally instantiated policy and customer/network/
      service profile matching of traffic flows for identification of
      appropriate outbound forwarding actions.  Classification is
      performed by a classifier.

   Service Function (SF):  A network or application based packet
      treatment, application, compute or storage resource, used
      singularly or in concert with other service functions within a
      service chain to enable a service offered by an operator.

      A non-exhaustive list of Service Functions includes: firewalls,
      WAN and application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI),
      server load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HOST_ID
      injection, HTTP Header Enrichment functions, TCP optimizer, etc.


   Service:  An offering provided by an operator that is delivered using
      one or more service functions.  This may also be referred to as a
      composite service.

      Note: The term "service" is overloaded with varying definitions.
      For example, to some a service is an offering composed of several
      elements within the operators network whereas for others a
      service, or more specifically a network service, is a discrete
      element such as a firewall.  Traditionally, these network services
      host a set of service functions and have a network locator where
      the service is hosted.

   Service Node (SN):  Physical or virtual element that hosts one or
      more service functions and has one or more network locators
      associated with it for reachability and service delivery.

   Service Function Chain (SFC):  A set of service functions that are to
      be applied to selected traffic in a specific order.  The implied
      order may not be a linear progression as the architecture will
      allow for nodes that copy to more than one branch.  The term
      service chain is often used as a shorthand version of service
      function chain.

1.3.  Service Function Chaining

   Service Function Chaining is a concept that implies more than just an
   ordered set of service functions, rather it describes a method for
   deploying service functions that enables not only ordering but
   topological independence of those service functions.  A basic service
   function chain might simply utilize an existing overlay technology
   along with service specific forwarding in the network to steer
   traffic to the necessary service functions.  However, additional
   information that is shared across a subset of service functions
   enables value added service functions and a richer service function
   chain.  For example, shared information, such as the results of a
   classification function, may be passed to downstream service
   functions to enable the offloading of service function processing.
   As another example, sharing the information derived at one service
   function to the rest in the service chain would not only obviate the
   need to re-derive the same information but also simplifies the
   service as re-deriving may be impractical (for example when the
   packet may have been encrypted by an intermediate service function.)

2.  Architectural Concepts

   The following sections describe the core principles of a service
   function chaining infrastructure.

2.1.  Service Function Chains

   In most networks services are constructed as a sequence of service
   functions that represent a Service Function Chain.  The collection of
   available service functions within an administrative domain forms a
   directed graph where the vertices represent an individual service
   function and the edges form the network connecting those vertices as
   partially represented in figure 1.

   At a high level, service function chaining creates an abstracted view
   of a service and specifies the set of required service functions as
   well as the order in which they must be executed.  Sub-graphs, from
   the overall directed graph, define each Service Function Chain.
   Service functions can be part of zero, one, or many service function
   chains.  A given SF can appear one time or multiple times in a given
   SFC.

   Service function chains can start from the origination point of the
   service function chain (i.e.: SF1 in Figure 1), or from any
   subsequent SF in the graph.  SFs can therefore become branches in the
   graph, with those SFs performing forwarding decisions that move
   traffic to one or more branches.  It is important to understand that
   multiple branches between nodes may exist, as with any network, and
   thus multicast as well as unicast forwarding paradigms are valid.
   Service function chains can have more than one terminus.

   The architecture allows for two or more service functions to be co-
   resident on the same service node.  In these cases, some
   implementations may choose to use some form of internal inter-process
   or inter-VM messaging (communication behind the virtual switching
   element) that is optimized for such an environment.  Implementation
   details of such mechanisms are considered out-of-scope for this

2.2.  Service Function Chain Symmetry

   Service Function Chains may be unidirectional or bidirectional.  A
   unidirectional service function chain requires traffic to be
   forwarded through the ordered service functions in one direction (SF1
   -> SF2 -> SF3), whereas a bidirectional service function chain
   requires a symmetric path (SF1 -> SF2 -> SF3 and SF3 -> SF2 -> SF1).
   A hybrid service function chain has attributes of both bidirectional
   and unidirectional service function chains: some service functions
   require symmetric traffic, other service functions do not process
   reverse traffic.

   Service function chains may contain cycles, that is functions may be
   traversed more than once within a chain.

2.3.  Service Function Paths

   Service function chains, when instantiated in the network, lead to
   the selection of specific instances of service functions at various
   SNs as well as the creation of the service topology using the network
   locator of each individual SN.  Thus, instantiation of the service
   function chain results in the creation of a Service Function Path and
   is used for forwarding packets through the service function chain.
   In other words, Service Function Path is the instantiation of the
   defined service function chain.

   This abstraction enables the binding of service function chains to
   specific service function instances based on a range of policy
   attributes defined by the operator.  For example, a service function
   chain definition might specify that one of the service function
   elements of the chain is a firewall.  However, on the network, there
   might exist a number of instances of the same firewall service
   function (that is to say they enforce the same policy) and only when
   the service function path is created is one of those firewall
   instances selected.  The selection can be based on a range of policy
   attributes, ranging from simple to more elaborate criteria.

   Classifiers can select the instances in the data path, offloading/
   distributing the service instance load distribution functionality and
   improving the convergence time if there is a service instance
   failure. criteria.

3.  Service Function Chaining Architecture

3.1.  Architecture Principles

   Service function chaining is predicated on several key architectural
   principles:

   1.  Topological independence: no changes to the underlay network
       forwarding topology - implicit, or explicit - are needed to
       deploy and invoke service functions.

   2.  Consistent policy identifiers: rather than varying identifiers,
       with service function chaining, a common identifier is used to
       service function policy selection.

   3.  Classification: traffic that satisfies some classification rules
       may then be forwarded according to a specific SF chain.  For
       example, classification can be as simple as an explicit
       forwarding entry that forwards all traffic from one address into
       the service function chain that starts on some interface of a
       forwarding entity.  Multiple classification points are possible
       within a service function chain (i.e. forming a service graph)
       thus enabling changes/update to the path by functions.

   4.  Sharing of metadata/context: the network and service functions no
       longer exist in separate silos.  Metadata/context data can be
       shared amongst all participating nodes.

   5.  Heterogenous control/policy points allowing SF functions to use
       independent mechanisms (out of scope for this document) like IF-
       MAP or Diameter to populate and resolve local policy and (if
       needed) local classification criteria.

3.2.  Fundamental Components

   Service function chaining can be divided into several components that
   together form the basis of the architecture:

   1.  Service Node: This is the embodiment of a service function, and
       can be instantiated within a physical or virtual SNs that host
       one or more logical service functions.  These entities may have
       one or more network locators associated with them for
       reachability and service delivery.

   2.  Service Functions as Resources: The concept of a service function
       evolves: rather than being viewed as a bump in the wire, a
       service function becomes a resource within a specified
       administrative domain that is available for consumption.  As



Quinn, et al.            Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              SFC Architecture                October 2013


       such, service functions have a network locator and a variable set
       of attributes that describe the function offered.  The
       combination of locator and attributes are used to construct a
       service function chain.

   3.  Classifier: A component that performs traffic classification.
       Classification is the precursor to the start of a service
       function path: traffic that matches classification criteria is
       forwarded along a given service function path to realize the
       specifications of a service function chain.  The granularity of
       classification varies based on operator requirements and device
       capabilities.  While initial classification at a network node
       starts a service function path, subsequent classifications may
       occur along the service function chain and further alter the
       service function path.  This re-classification may also update
       the context information (see below).

   4.  Overlay Service Topology: A service topology is created to
       interconnect the elements used to form the service function path.
       This overlay topology is specific to the service function path:
       it is created for the express purpose of steering the service
       packets through the service functions and optionally passing
       context data.  The overlay topology can be constructed using any
       existing transport, for example IP, MPLS, etc.

   5.  Control plane: The service function chaining control plane is
       responsible for constructing the service function paths:
       translating the service function chains to the forwarding paths
       and propagating path information to participating nodes - network
       and service - to achieve requisite forwarding behavior to
       construct the service overlay.  For instance, a service function
       chain construction may be static - using specific service
       function instances, or dynamic - choosing service explicit
       function instances at the time of delivering traffic to the
       service function.  In service function chaining, service
       functions are resources; the control plane advertises their
       capabilities, availability and location.  The control plane is
       also responsible for the creation of the context (see below).
       The control plane may exist within distributed routing elements
       as in traditional networks, or in a centralized configuration.

   6.  Shared context data: Sharing context data allows the network to
       provide network-derived information to the service functions,
       service function to service function information exchange and the
       sharing of service-derived information to the network.  This
       component is optional.  Service function chaining infrastructure
       enables the exchange of this shared context along the service
       function path.  The shared context serves several key functions

       within the architecture:


       *  Allows elements that typically operate as ships-in-the-night
          to exchange information

       *  Encodes information about the network and/or data for post-
          service forwarding

       *  Creates an identifier used for policy binding by service
          functions


       Context information can be derived in several ways:

       *  External sources

       *  Network node classification

       *  Service function classification

   7.  Resource Control: The SFC system may be responsible for managing
       all resources necessary for the SFC components to function.  This
       includes network constraints used to plan and choose the network
       path(s) between service nodes, characteristics of the nodes
       themselves such as memory, number of virtual interfaces, routes,
       etc..., and configuration of the service functions running on the
       service nodes.

Appendix A.  Existing Service Deployments

   Existing service insertion and deployment techniques fail to address
   new challenging requirements raised by modern network architectures
   and evolving technologies such as multi-tenancy, virtualization,
   elasticity, and orchestration.  Networks, servers, storage
   technologies, and applications, have all undergone significant change
   in recent years: virtualization, network overlays, and orchestration
   have increasingly become adopted techniques.  All of these have
   profound effects on network and services design.

   As network service functions evolve, operators are faced with an
   array of form factors - virtual and physical - as well as with a
   range of insertion methods that often vary by vendor and type of
   service.

   Such existing services are deployed using a range of techniques, most
   often associated with topology or forwarding modifications.  For
   example, firewalls often rely on layer-2 network changes for
   deployment: a VLAN is created for the "inside" interface, and another
   for the "outside" interface.  In other words, a new L2 segment was
   created simply to add a service function.  In the case of server load
   balancers, policy routing is often used to ensure traffic from
   server's returns to the load balancer.  As with the firewall example,
   the policy routing serves only to ensure that the network traffic
   ultimately flows to the service function(s).

   The network-centric information (e.g.  VLAN) is not limited to
   insertion; this information is often used as a policy identifier on
   the service itself.  So, on a firewall, the layer-2 segment
   identifies the local policy to be selected.  If more granular policy
   discrimination is required, more network identifiers must be created
   either per-hop, or communicated consistently to all services.

Appendix B.  Issues with Existing Deployments

   Due to the tight coupling of network and service function resources
   in existing networks, adding or removing service functions is a
   complex task that is fraught with risk and is tied to
   operationalizing topological changes leading to massively static
   configuration procedures for network service delivery or update
   purposes.  The inflexibility of such deployments limits (and in many
   cases precludes) dynamic service scaling (both horizontal and
   vertical) and requires hop-by-hop configuration to ensure that the
   correct service functions, and sequence of service functions are
   traversed.

   A non-exhaustive list of existing service deployment and insertion
   techniques as well as the issues associated with each may be found in
   [NSCprob].
