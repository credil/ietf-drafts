This document discusses how national bibliography numbers (persistent
and unique identifiers assigned by the national libraries) can be
supported within the URN (Uniform Resource Names) framework and the
syntax for URNs defined in RFC 2141.  Much of the discussion is
based on the ideas expressed in RFC 2288.
