                  LISP Extensions for Segment Routing

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) combines source routing and tunneling to steer
   traffic through the transit network.  The Locator/ID Separation
   Protocol (LISP) separates IP addresses into Endpoint Identifiers
   (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs) and also leverages tunneling
   mechanisms.  Mapping between EIDs and RLOCs is facilitated by the
   LISP mapping system.  Combining LISP and SR enables the LISP mapping
   system to provide SR information to encapsulating routers so that
   traffic can be steered in the transit network or the list of segments
   a particular packet traverses is recorded in the packet header.

   This document describes extensions required to the Locator/ID
   Separation Protocol (LISP) to enable a LISP mapping system to
   communicate list of segment identifiers or the request to record the
   list of segments a particular packet traverses to the encapsulating
   router.

Internet-Draft           LISP and SR integration               July 2013


   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
   paths within network topologies by encoding paths as sequences of
   topological sub-paths, called "segments" as described in
   [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing].  Segment routing can be applied
   to IPv6 with a new type of routing extension header.  The Locator/ID
   Separation Protocol [RFC6830] specifies an architecture and mechanism
   for replacing the addresses currently used by IP with two separate
   name spaces: Endpoint IDs (EIDs), used within sites; and Routing
   Locators (RLOCs), used on the transit networks that make up the
   Internet infrastructure.  To achieve this separation, LISP defines
   protocol mechanisms for mapping from EIDs to RLOCs.  In addition,
   LISP assumes the existence of a database to store and propagate those
   mappings globally.

   When LISP is combined with SR, the EID to RLOC mapping information
   can be extended with segment routing information.  This allows for a
   closer correlation between the transit network, that is sometimes
   also referred to as the underlay network, and the overlay network.
   It is beyond the scope of this document to describe how the LISP
   mapping system obtains a segment list for a particular EID-to-RLOC
   mapping.  This draft outlines use-cases for combining LISP and SR as
   well as extensions to the LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) for
   traffic engineering (LCAF type 10) [I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf].  These
   extensions are to be integrated into a future revision of
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf].

3.  Use cases that combine LISP and SR

   Use-cases that combine LISP and SR include traffic steering/traffic
   engineering as well as traffic tracing in the underlay network.

3.1.  Traffic steering/traffic engineering

   LISP combined with SR can be used to steer traffic in the underlay
   network: The mapping system communicates a segment list to the LISP
   ingress tunnel router (ITR) when resolving the EID-to-RLOC mapping as
   part of a LISP Map-Reply.  This extension allows the LISP mapping
   system to provide a list of segment identifiers to encapsulating
   routers so that traffic can be steered in the transit network.  In a
   typical setup the LISP ingress tunnel router would retrieve the
   segment list from the mapping system along with the associated RLOC
   using the EID as the lookup key.  The ITR encapsulates the packet to
   the RLOC, also including the segment list in the segment routing
   extension header.  The packet is forwarded to the ETR using segment
   routing techniques.  The ETR decapsulates the packet and delivers the
   packet to the destination EID.  Given that in SR with IPv6 transport
   the entire segment list is available in the SR-specific extension
   header of the outer IPv6 header, the LISP egress tunnel router, which
   is the tunnel endpoint is also informed about the path a particular
   packet took in the transport network.

   LISP with SR for traffic engineering adds to the LISP traffic
   engineering use-cases described in [I-D.farinacci-lisp-te].  LISP
   combined with SR offers traffic engineering without using
   reencapsulating tunnels [RFC6830].  Reencapsulating tunnels and SR
   with LISP are complementary traffic engineering techniques and could
   be combined.  SR could for example be used in an explicit locator
   path (ELP) to further traffic engineer a path between two
   reencapsulating routers.

3.2.  Traffic tracing

Internet-Draft           LISP and SR integration               July 2013


   LISP combined with SR can be used to get more information about the
   path a packet took in the underlay network without sending extra
   probe traffic.  When SR is applied to IPv6, the segment list
   describing the path that a packet takes through the network can be
   recorded in the SR-specific extension header of the outer IPv6 packet
   header.  This activity is referred to as segment tracing.  Segment
   tracing can be performed independently from steering traffic using SR
   techniques.  It can also be used in a transit network which performs
   normal IPv6 routing.  When tracing is enabled, the segment ID of
   every segment that a packet traverses is recorded in the SR-specific
   extension header.  This means that the egress tunnel router receives
   information about the path, represented by the segment list, a
   particular packet has taken in the underlay network.  Different from
   OAM mechanisms which send active probe packets, tracing information
   can be made available for production traffic.  The egress tunnel
   router can choose to provide the traced segment list back to the
   mapping system, for example through a LISP Map-Register.  This
   information can be used to ensure path symmetry send/receive traffic
   in the transit network, or can serve other OAM or statistical
   purposes.

4.  LISP extensions to support SR

   Segment routing information can be contained within the LISP mapping
   system.  A segment identifier is a 32-bit identification either for a
   topological instruction or a service instruction.  See
   [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing] for details.

   An EID can be associated with one or multiple ordered lists of
   segment identifiers, also referred to as "segment lists", encoding
   the topological and service source route of a packet.  The segment
   list can serve either traffic engineering or operational purposes.
   In case of traffic engineering purposes, the segment list describes
   the set of segments a packet visits when traversing the transit
   network.  The segment list enables the ITR to steer traffic using
   segment routing techniques.  The ITR retrieves the segment list from
   the mapping system along with the associated RLOC using the EID as
   the lookup key.  For operations and maintenance use, the segment list
   documents the set of segments a packet visited on its way through the
   transit network.  It is beyond the scope of this document to describe
   the detailed procedures how the LISP mapping system obtains a segment
   list for a particular EID-to-RLOC mapping.

   Segment routing extensions for LISP extend the Explicit Locator Path
   (ELP) Canonical Address Format, which is LCAF type 10,
   see[I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf] for details.  A new Address Family Identifier
   (AFI) in LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) type
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf] carries the 32-bit segment identifier.  For a

Internet-Draft           LISP and SR integration               July 2013


   given EID lookup in the mapping database, the segment routing list in
   ELP LCAF type can be returned to provide a segment list to each
   locator in the Map-Reply locator set.  The ELP LCAF type can also be
   used to send the segment list that a particular packet traversed to
   the LISP mapping system using a Map-Register message defined in
   [RFC6833].

   The segment identification AFI to be allocated is described below:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       |                              SID                              |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+




   AFI=TBD_SID: TBD_SID is a value allocated from [AFI] for segment
   identifiers.

   Reserved: this 8-bit field reserved for future use and to carry
   specific control bits.  If used with the ELP LCAF, this field carries
   several bits (see below).

   SID: 4 byte segment identifier

   The segment identification AFI is used within the ELP LCAF to
   describe the list of segments a packet is to visit or has visited on
   its way through the transit network.  Further below examples are
   shown how the segment identification AFI is used for the ELP LCAF
   type.  A new bit, the T-bit, is added to the LISP LCAF type 10
   described in [I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf].  This addition is to be integrated
   into a future revision of [I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf].

   For the segment routing AFI, the T-bit is defined as follows:

   T-Bit: An additional bit in the Rsvd3 field is to be allocated in
   LCAF type 10.  The T-bit (T=1) is used by the LISP mapping system to
   indicate to an ITR that for particular EID-to-RLOC mapping the
   segments traversed by packets SHOULD be recorded as a segment list in
   the SR IPv6 extension header.  This bit is ignored if present in a
   Map-Register message.  A Map-Register message could be used by the
   ETR to inform the mapping system about the segments that a packet
   visited in the transit network.

   This example shows the Explicit Locator Path (ELP) Canonical Address
   Format in a setup where segment routing is used in the transit
   network between ITR and ETR.  Traffic engineering using
   reencapsulating routers is not used.

   The reply to an EID-to-RLOC lookup contains the SIDs to be visited in
   the underlay network to reach the RLOC address returned in AFI=x. In
   the example below SID_1,...,SID_p are to be used for segment routing
   towards the "Address" RLOC.  SID_p is the identifier of the last
   segment which takes the packet to the "Address" RLOC.

   This example shows the Explicit Locator Path (ELP) Canonical Address
   Format when using SR combined with reencapsulation routers.

   Segment routing and traffic engineering using reencapsulating routers
   can be combined.  In the example below, segment routing is used to
   steer traffic in the underlay between reencapsulating routers "f" and
   "g".  There is no segment routing used between any of the other
   reencapsulating router hops.

5.  IANA Considerations

   A new AFI for segment identifiers is to be allocated by IANA (see
   [AFI] for a list of currently allocated AFIs).
