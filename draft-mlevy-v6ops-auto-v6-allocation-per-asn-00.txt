   A mechanism to allocate IPv6 blocks for BGP networks based on the
                           networks AS Number
          draft-mlevy-v6ops-auto-v6-allocation-per-asn-00.txt

Abstract

   This document provides a methodology for automatically allocating
   IPv6 [RFC2460] address blocks for networks that run BGP [RFC4271] and
   are either single-homed or multi-homed [BARBER2011].  The automatic
   allocation is taken from a specific /16 block assigned by IANA for
   this purpose.

   Networks that require more than this single /48 can still request
   additional allocations via the existing RIR process.  Networks are
   not forced to use this allocation and can ignore this completely.
   Availability of the /48 assignment via this mechanism does not change
   existing mechanisms for obtaining IPv6 assignments through the
   existing RIR (Regional Internet Registry) or LIR (Local Internet
   Registry) mechanisms.

   There is an implicit assumption that it's a good thing to promote
   networks to enable IPv6 with a near-zero effort.

Internet-Draft  Auto allocation mechanism for IPv6 blocks   January 2013


1.  Introduction

   IPv6's massive address space provides a wonderful opportunity to
   radically change the process of IP address allocation.  Presently
   IPv6 allocation is the same process as used by the IPv4 world.  The
   RIRs allocate IPv6 address blocks based on member requests and their
   space requirements.  A minimum allocation of a /48 is believed to be
   sufficient to start any enterprise in the world of IPv6.

   Described below is a method to automatically define an IPv6 /48 block
   that can be used in the global routing tables for any ASN.


2.  Defining the /48 address

   The /48 address is allocated using a fixed pattern.


   ASN-based address assignment
   +----------+--------------------+-----------------/ /------------+
   | IANA /16 |     32 bit ASN     |   80 bits for IPv6 /48 space   |
   +----------+--------------------+-----------------/ /------------+

   The sum of the bits in the IANA allocated /16 prefix plus the 32 bits
   of the ASN plus the /48 of user defined usage adds up to 128 bits.

                      +------+----------------------+
                      | Bits |                Usage |
                      +------+----------------------+
                      |   16 | IANA provided prefix |
                      |   32 |                  ASN |
                      |   80 |         User defined |
                      |  128 |                TOTAL |
                      +------+----------------------+

                        Table 1: Address space math

   The end network can allocate out of the assigned /48 as needed.  It
   is assumed that the end network will use this allocation for global
   routing; however the network may choose to not announce this
   allocation.

   If any route is announced from this allocation, any prefixes more
   specific than the allocated /48 must not be propagated in to the
   global IPv6 routing table.  This is to prevent the IPv6 routing table
   from becoming too large.  Therefore, a site which uses this
   allocation MUST NOT advertise a more specific than the allocated /48
   routing prefix.  All native IPv6 network operators MUST filter out

   and discard any routing prefix advertisements longer than /48 from
   within this /16 allocation.


3.  IANA allocated /16

   IANA is to allocate a /16 in a similar manner to the 2002::/16
   allocation for 6to4 [RFC3068] which is used by the 6to4
   protocol[RFC3056]..  No IPv4 allocation by IANA is required.


4.  ASN bit length

   ASNs are now defined as 32 bits[RFC4893] long.  If a network operates
   a smaller 16 bit ASN (for example an earlier allocation) then there
   are 16 bits of zeros prepending the ASN number.  No provision is
   provided within this allocation methodology to provide 16 bit ASNs
   with an advantage as this could cause an overlapping allocation.

   No special treatment is provided an operator of a 16 bit ASN; All
   ASNs are considered to use 32 bits.


   16 bit ASNs (shown at binary)
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
   | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | #### | #### | #### | #### |
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

   32 bit ASNs (shown at binary)
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
   | #### | #### | #### | #### | #### | #### | #### | #### |
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

   ASNs are normally expressed as human-readable decimal numbers; yet
   for this allocation the number should be converted into a hexadecimal
   notation.  All IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal.  (NNNN
   represents the /16 allocation by IANA)

       +----------------+--------------------+---------------------+
       | ASN in decemal | ASN in hexadecimal |     Sample IP block |
       +----------------+--------------------+---------------------+
       |            AS1 |                  1 | NNNN:0000:0001::/48 |
       |         AS6939 |               1B1B | NNNN:0000:1B1B::/48 |
       |        AS29001 |               7149 | NNNN:0000:0001::/48 |
       |       AS393220 |              60004 | NNNN:0006:0004::/48 |
       +----------------+--------------------+---------------------+

   A network is assigned an ASN via the existing RIR process.  Only
   valid ASN holders can use this ASN-based prefix.


5.  ASN allocation

   ASNs are allocated by RIRs and this RFC does not handle that arena.

   ASNs defined as private ASNs MUST NOT use this scheme.  The special
   16-bit ASN 23456 MUST NOT use this scheme.


6.  BGP Filtering and Validation

   Filtering would be a simple case of mapping the final ASN in a path
   to the prefix in an exact bit-order match.

   For example; the prefix NNNN:0000:1B1B::/48 should only be seen as
   announced from AS6939 (6939 equals 0x1B1B in hex).  Networks would
   have their upstream transit providers add this /48 prefix to their
   existing inbound BGP route filters.


7.  Whois

   In order for the IPv6 /48 to have valid whois information RIRs will
   have to map it from their existing ASN whois data.  The whois data
   for the /48 should be the same as the ASN whois data.


8.  RIR support

   It is suggested that RIRs, via their Internet Registry services,
   support these automatic assignments (including but not limited to
   whois and reverse DNS).  The RIRs should provide these services in
   addition to the services already provided for the associated AS
   number.


9.  Reverse DNS

   Reverse DNS is vital to the operation of the global Internet.  Any
   block allocated via this mechanism should include the ability to have
   the network operator provide reverse DNS entries.

   It is proposed that the first /64 from the allocated /48 have the
   rDNS services hard coded into the ::1 and ::2 addresses.  This allows
   reverse DNS to operate without intervention or RIR involvement.

       Nameserver 1:    NNNN:####:####:0000::1
       Naneserver 2:    NNNN:####:####:0000::2


10.  Routing Table Impact

   This mechanism is not expected to have any impact to the global
   Internet routing table since existing policies in the RIR system
   already readily provide for the allocation of provider-independent
   IPv6 prefixes.  Additionally, AS number holders are likely to be
   multihomed entities which were going to be independently routed in
   any case.  Service Providers are, as always, not obligated to route
   these IPv6 assignments and/or may establish conditions of service
   which offset any additional routing cost.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to allocate a /16 from the
   available IPv6 address space.


12.  Security Considerations

   There is clearly a need for RPKI ROAs for all allocated ASNs within
   an RIR.  The mapping would be 1:1 from ASN to /48 prefix.  Hence an
   RIR allocating an ASN should also allow the holder of that ASN to
   manage this IPv6 prefix via their RIR portal.

   There is nothing different in with a prefix from this space than from
   a prefix allocated by an RIR.
