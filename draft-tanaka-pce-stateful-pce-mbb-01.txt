 Make-Before-Break MPLS-TE LSP restoration and reoptimization procedure
                           using Stateful PCE
                  draft-tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-mbb-01

Abstract

   Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding
   protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do
   stateful control of MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
   LSP).  Stateful PCE supports manipulating the existing LSP's state
   and attributes (e.g., bandwidth and route) and also creating totally
   new LSPs in the network.

   In the current MPLS TE network using RSVP-TE, LSPs are often
   controlled by "make-before-break (M-B-B)" signaling by headend for
   the purpose of LSP restoration and reoptimization.  In most cases, it
   is an essential operation to reroute LSP traffic without any data
   disruption.

   This document specifies the procedure of applying stateful PCE's
   control to make-before-break RSVP-TE signaling.  In this document,
   two types of restoration/reoptimization procedures are defined,
   implicit mode and explicit mode.  This document also specifies the
   usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol)
   messages, expected behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several
   extensions of additional PCEP objects.

Internet-Draft     M-B-B procedure using Stateful PCE           Jul 2013


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes the stateful Path Computation
   Elements(PCE).  Stateful PCE defines the extensions to PCEP to enable
   stateful control of LSPs between and across PCEP sessions, and it
   also describes mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between
   PCCs and PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of path
   computations within and across PCEP sessions.

   Today, however, there is no detailed procedure specified as to how to
   restore and reoptimize one particular MPLS-TE LSP using stateful PCE.
   In today's MPLS RSVP-TE mechanism, make-before-break (M-B-B) is a
   widely common scheme supported by headend LER in order to assure no
   traffic disruption during restoration and reoptimization.  Hence it
   is naturally desirable for stateful PCE to control M-B-B based
   signaling and forwarding process.

   This document specifies the definite procedures of applying stateful
   PCE's control to M-B-B method.  In this document, two types of
   restoration/reoptimization procedures are defined, Implicit mode and
   explicit mode.  This document also specifies the usage and handling
   of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol) messages, expected
   behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several extensions of
   additional objects.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC3209]: make-
   before-break.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC4426] and
   [RFC4427]: recovery, protection, restoration.

   According to their definition the term "recovery" is generically used
   to denote both protection and restoration; the specific terms
   "protection" and "restoration" are used only when differentiation is
   required.  The subtle distinction between protection and restoration



Tanaka & Kamite         Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     M-B-B procedure using Stateful PCE           Jul 2013


   is made based on the resource allocation done during the recovery
   period.  Hence the protection allocates LSP resource in advance of a
   failure, while the restoration allocates LSP after a failure occur.


4.  Motivation

   As for current MPLS mechanism, make-before-break(M-B-B) concept is
   outlined in [RFC3209], which allows adaptive and smooth RSVP-TE LSP
   rerouting that does not disrupt traffic or adversely impact network
   operations while rerouting is in progress.  M-B-B is applicable for
   reoptimizing LSP's route and resources for several use cases, for
   example, to adopt better path for reversion after failure, to change
   traversing node/links for planned maintenance, to change bandwidth of
   LSPs.  M-B-B is also used for global restoration scenario in case of
   failure, which is effective if operators do not want to reserve both
   working and standby LSPs' bandwidth in advance.  In real deployment,
   it can also be operated with local protection scheme FRR (Fast
   ReRoute).

   Since M-B-B operational scheme is universally common in MPLS network
   today, it is naturally much desirable to utilize it under the
   architecture of stateful PCE.

   The basic procedure of the Make-Before-Break method is outlined as
   follows:

      1.  Establish a new LSP
      2.  Transfer data traffic from old LSP onto the new LSP
      3.  Tear down the old LSP

   In M-B-B, it is an important behavior that headend node handles the
   sequence of data traffic switchover.  The headend is able to "make"
   one or more new LSPs for a particular Tunnel (i.e., it is allowed to
   signal multiple RSVP sessions with different LSP-IDs that share a
   common Tunnel IDs), and the headend will switch the traffic upon only
   one (or some) of those LSPs.  In some use cases about stateful PCE,
   it is expected that operators can watch and control when the data is
   switched over and which LSPs are used.  Therefore, this document
   covers such a procedure and related message extensions.


5.  Make-Before-Break LSP procedures

   There are possibly two modes introduced for Make-Before-Break
   procedure under stateful PCE.  The first one is "implicit M-B-B
   mode", where the operation is triggered by a PC Update Request(PCUpd)
   message from a PCE, and a PCC handles whole Make-Before-Break steps



Tanaka & Kamite         Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     M-B-B procedure using Stateful PCE           Jul 2013


   (signaling and transferring data traffic) for itself.  This mode
   utilizes the existing messages as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] .

   The second one is "explicit M-B-B mode", where the operation is
   triggered by a PCUpd message with TRIAL LSP TLV, which is defined in
   Section 6.1.  A PCE also controls timing and sequence of each
   granular step that a PCC takes.  This procedure additionally uses a
   new extended TLV that is defined in Section 6.2

   Both types of procedure require at least two LSPs residing in a
   single MPLS-TE tunnel, working LSP and trial LSPs.  An ingress node
   is currently transporting data traffic on the working LSP, and then
   it establishes one or more trial LSPs.  As per [RFC3209] Section 2.5.
   "LSP ID" of a restoration LSP, which is newly signaled, differs from
   that of a working LSP.  In this document, LSP ID of a working LSP
   describes "old" and that of a trial LSP describes "new" as a simple
   example.

   Implicit mode has high affinity with most existing MPLS edge node
   implementations which perform entire steps of M-B-B automatically at
   once.  This mode is particularly applicable for migration scenario
   for the existing deployment where service providers want their
   recovery operation be delegated to centralized PCE.

   Explicit mode is much more flexible than Implicit mode since it
   allows PCEs to manage each LSP step-by-step.  Explicit mode is
   applicable to several new use cases that require split control of
   signaling and data switchover.  For example, if end-to-end data path
   is created by connecting multiple individual LSPs across different
   segments (e.g., LSP stitching), in reoptimization scenario, data
   flowing cannot be started unless all signaling of all LSPs is
   completed.  Similarly, there is a case under Software Defined Network
   (SDN) applications, where MPLS domain is connected to other non-MPLS
   domains, and the end-to-end data switchover timing should be
   carefully coordinated with various different methods of path/flow
   setup in each domain.

   PCC and PCE can distinguish which mode, implicit mode or explicit
   mode, is to be performed by checking the type of PCEP messages that
   are exchanged.  The implementation MAY support both modes, but for
   each restoration/reoptimization operation, either one of them SHOULD
   be exclusively selected.

5.1.  Implicit Make-Before-Break Mode

   This specifies the detailed procedure of M-B-B LSP restoration and
   reoptimization using exsisting messages which are defined in



Tanaka & Kamite         Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     M-B-B procedure using Stateful PCE           Jul 2013


   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] .  This procedure is based on the current
   existing messages/TLVs and no extended TLV is used.  Once a PCC
   receives PCUpd message from a PCE, the PCC automatically executes the
   implicit M-B-B procedure as described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   Section 6.2.

   First, A PCUpd message is sent from a PCE to trigger M-B-B procecure.
   Once a PCC received the PCUpd message, the PCC starts signaling a new
   restoration LSP and it sends back to the PCE a PCRpt message with
   LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV in the LSP Object.

   Second, once a restoration LSP is successfully established, a PCC
   transfers data traffic from working LSP to restoration LSP.  If the
   restoration LSP failed in setup, the PCC notifies the PCE the result
   in a PCRpt message and it MAY wait for a next instruction from the
   PCE.

   Finally, when a PCC successfully transfered data traffic to
   restoration LSP, the PCC tears down the (previous) working LSP by
   RSVP-TE signaling, then the PCC MUST send a PCRpt message.  That
   PCRpt message MUST carry a LSP Object with LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV which
   indicates the value of RSVP-TE signaling the PCC has just torn down.

   Following Figure 1 illustrates the example of implicit M-B-B
   procedure, in following conditions.

5.2.  Explicit Make-Before-Break Mode

   Comparing to the implicit M-B-B mode, explicit M-B-B mode allows a
   PCE to control timing and sequence of subsequent make-before-break
   steps as follows.

   First, the PCE initiates PCC's signaling of a new LSP by sending a
   LSP Update Request(PCUpd) message with TRIAL-LSP TLV that are defined
   in this document.  Second, the PCE instructs the PCC to transfer data
   traffic from old LSP to new LSP by sending a PCUpd message with
   TRIAL-LSP TLV and DATA-CONTROL TLV that are defined in [I-D.tanaka-
   pce-stateful-pce-data-ctrl].  Third, the PCE MAY instruct the PCC to

   tear down the old LSP by sending a PCUpd message indicating LSP
   removal.

   The following subsections specify each Make-Before-Break steps in
   detail.

5.2.1.  Establish new Trial LSP

   As a first step of M-B-B procedure, a PCC establishes a new LSP for
   restoration once PCC receives a PCUpd message with TRIAL-LSP TLV from
   a PCE.  We call this newly established LSPs for restoration "trial
   LSP".  A trial LSP is signaled the same RSVP-TE Tunnel ID but
   different LSP ID from active working LSP, and both the active working
   LSP and new trial LSPs MUST be signaled with Shared Explicit style as
   describes in [RFC3209].  TRIAL-LSP TLV triggers explicit mode M-B-B.
   A PCE do not have to assign RSVP-TE LSP ID for trial LSP signaling,
   however it MAY specify RSVP-TE LSP ID that the PCC is going to
   establish.

   When a new trial LSP was signaled successfully, the PCC sends a PCRpt
   message toward the PCE to notify the result.  The PCRpt message from
   the PCC MUST have the LSP object with LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV that
   indicates RSVP-TE Tunnel ID and LSP ID the PCC has just established.

   If a new trial LSP failed to be established by some reason of RSVP-TE
   signaling, the PCC MUST send a PCRpt message carrying LSP-IDENTIFIERS
   TLV and RSVP-ERROR-SPEC TLV as defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   Section 7.3.4. to the PCE.

   A PCC SHOULD accept multiple PCUpd messages with TRIAL-LSP TLV in a
   LSP Object.  And a PCC SHOULD establish as many trial lsps as the
   number of PCUpd messages it receives.

   Figure 2 illustrates a example, working LSP(PLSP-ID P1,Tunnel ID T1,
   LSP-ID old, ERO Ingress-a-b-Egress), trial LSP(Tunnel ID T1, LSP-ID
   new, ERO Ingress-a-c-b-Egress).

5.2.2.  Switchover Data Traffic triggered by a PCUpd message

   As a second step, PCC(Ingress) transfers data traffic from a working
   LSP to a trial LSP.  To specify desired LSP for transferring data
   traffic, a PCUpd message from a PCE MUST have a TRIAL-LSP TLV and a
   DATA-CONTROL TLV in a LSP Object.

   A TRIAL-LSP TLV specifies desired RSVP-TE LSP-ID a PCC starts useing
   for transferring data traffic.  And a DATA-CONTROL TLV triggers data
   traffic switch over.  Both TLVs MUST be assembled into a single LSP
   Object.

   Once the PCC receives the PCUpd message with TRIAL-LSP TLV and DATA-
   CONTROL TLV in the LSP Object, the PCC MSUT start transfer data
   traffic to new trial LSP immediately.(See Figure 3)

   In DATA-CONTROL TLV, Origin(O) bit, which represents traffic origin,

5.2.3.  Tear Down old LSP

   As a final step of Make-Before-Break procedure, the PCC tears down
   the working LSP and the other trial lsps which the data traffic is no
   longer used.

   The PCC SHOULD tear down the old working LSP and other trial LSPs
   immediately once the data traffic succesfully switched over (See
   Figure 3).  In OPTIONAL, a PCC tears down old lsp separately.


6.  Objects and TLV Formats

6.1.  Trial LSP TLV in LSP Objects

   This document defines a new TLV named TRIAL-LSP TLV.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



                      Figure 4: TRIAL-LSP TLV format

   TRIAL-LSP TLV is sub-TLV of the LSP Object and is used in a PCUpd
   message especially to perform explicit mode M-B-B.  A PCC signals a
   trial LSP once it receives a PCUpd in which LSP object has a TRIAL-
   LSP TLV(LSP-ID=0).  It MUST set RSVP LSP-ID in LSP-ID field of TRIAL-
   LSP TLV in order to notify a PCC of desired trial LSP to be carried
   data traffic.

   LSP-ID:   This field fills the same value of RSVP-TE LSP-ID that is
      used in signaling.  LSP-ID MUST be zero in a PCUpd message when a
      PCE requests a PCC to signal new trial LSP.  LSP-ID MUST be non-
      zero when a PCE sends a PCUpd message to trigger traffic
      switchover execution.

6.2.  DATA-CONTROL TLV in LSP Objects

   DATA-CONTROL TLV in LSP Objects follows for easy reference of
   [I-D.tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-data-ctrl].

                          DATA-CONTROL TLV format

   Flags and fields

      O (traffic Origin - 1 bit):   "traffic Origin(O) = 1" indicates
         this is an active LSP (i.e., carring traffic now) whose traffic
         is to be switched over or to be load-balanced.  A PCE uses this
         bit to specify traffic origin that it wants to manipulate.  On
         the other hand, A PCC uses this bit in PCRpt message to notify
         a PCE that switching traffic succeeded and carrying data
         traffic.
      C (Continue - 1 bit):   If this flag set to 1, it indicates the
         next LSP Object encoded in the PCUpd has also DATA-CONTROL TLV.
         If this flag set to 0, it indicates no more LSP Object
         continues and load balancing calculation is completed, and then
         the PCC MUST perform switching traffic or load-balancing.
      Percentage - 8 bit [0B11111111 is reserved]:   This field
         specifies ratio of switching traffic as an unsigned char.  The
         sum of this field across subsequent LSP Object has to be
         hundred percent.  The value must be less than or equal to 100%
         (0B01100100) (e.g., If you want to set 50%, this field should
         be set to 0B00110010).  If no traffic goes through the
         corresponding LSP, this field should be set to 0%. 0% LSP MUST
         be deleted immediately after switchover.  The special value
         0B11111111 indicates traffic 0%, but the LSP MUST remain after
         switchover.

                                    for explicit mode
                 Error-value=TBD:  Specified LSP-ID is not existing.
                                    for explicit mode
                 Error-value=TBD:  Specified LSP-ID is not operational.
