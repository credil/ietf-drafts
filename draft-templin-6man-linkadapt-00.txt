            IPv6 Path MTU Interactions With Link Adaptation
                  draft-templin-6man-linkadapt-00.txt

Abstract

   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the
   network.  Instead, links with restricting Maximum Transmission Units
   (MTUs) must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6
   Packet Too Big (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation
   and reassembly (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below
   IPv6.  This latter category of links is often performance-challenged
   to accommodate steady-state link adaptation.  This document therefore
   proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better
   accommodate links that require link-specific adaptation to meet the
   IPv6 minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.

Internet-Draft            IPv6 Path MTU Updates           September 2013


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the
   network.  Instead, links with restricting Maximum Transmission Units
   (MTUs) must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6
   Packet Too Big (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation
   and reassembly (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below
   IPv6.  This latter category of links is often performance-challenged
   to accommodate steady-state link adaptation.  This document therefore
   proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better
   accommodate links that require link-specific adaptation to meet the
   IPv6 minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.


2.  Problem Statement

   The current "Internet cell size" is effectively 1500 bytes, i.e., the
   minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links in the Internet.
   IPv6 constrains this even further by specifying a minimum link MTU of
   1280 bytes [RFC2460].  However, due to operational issues with Path
   MTU Discovery (PMTUD) [RFC1981] these sizes can often only be
   accommodated when links with smaller link-layer segment sizes are
   configured to perform link adaptation.

   Unfortunately, link adaptation can present a significant burden to
   the link endpoints, i.e., especially when the link supports high data
   rates and/or is located nearer the "middle" of the network instead of
   nearer the "edge".  An alternative therefore is to ask the
   originating IPv6 node to either reduce the size of the packets it
   sends or perform host-based fragmentation, in which case reassembly
   would be performed by the final destination.

   In addition to the above considerations, it is becoming more and more
   evident that PMTUD uncertainties can be encountered even when there
   are no links in the path that must perform link adaptation.  This is
   due to the fact that the PTB messages required for PMTUD can be lost
   due to network filters that block ICMPv6 messages
   [RFC2923][WAND][SIGCOMM].  Originating IPv6 node are therefore
   advised to take precautions to avoid path MTU related failure modes.

   This document updates the IPv6 protocol specification [RFC2460] to
   better accommodate paths with various MTUs as described in the
   following sections.


3.  Link Adaptation Signaling and Accommodation

   Section 5 of [RFC2460] states:

   "IPv6 requires that every link in the Internet have an MTU of 1280
   octets or greater.  On any link that cannot convey a 1280-octet
   packet in one piece, link-specific fragmentation and reassembly must
   be provided at a layer below IPv6."

   and:

   "A node must be able to accept a fragmented packet that, after
   reassembly, is as large as 1500 octets.".

   This document does not propose to change these requirements, but
   notes that link adaptation can be burdensome for some links to the
   point that it would be highly desirable to signal the MTU limitation
   to the IPv6 communication endpoints.  In order to accommodate this,
   when the router at the link ingress performs link adaptation on a
   packet it should also send an ICMPv6 PTB message back to the original
   source (subject to rate limiting) with a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280
   and with Code field set to 1 [RFC4443].  (Note that these PTB
   messages are advisory in nature and do not necessarily indicate
   packet loss.)

   As a result, the originating IPv6 node may receive this "new kind" of
   PTB message and should modify its behavior accordingly.  This is
   accomplished by adding a new final paragraph to Section 5 of
   [RFC2460] as follows:

   "In response to an IPv6 packet that is sent to a destination located
   beyond an IPv6 link that must perform link adaptation, the
   originating IPv6 node may receive an ICMP Packet Too Big message
   reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280 and with Code=1.  In that
   case, the IPv6 node can either reduce the size of subsequent packet
   it sends or perform IPv6 fragmentation on packets no larger than 1500
   bytes by breaking the packet into N roughly equal-length pieces
   (where N is minimized and the length of each piece is smaller than
   the Next-Hop MTU).  These fragments will be reassembled by the
   destination."

3.1.  Accommodating Legacy Nodes

   Legacy IPv6 nodes observe the current final paragraph of Section 5 of
   [RFC2460]:

   "In response to an IPv6 packet that is sent to an IPv4 destination
   (i.e., a packet that undergoes translation from IPv6 to IPv4), the
   originating IPv6 node may receive an ICMP Packet Too Big message
   reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280.  In that case, the IPv6 node
   is not required to reduce the size of subsequent packets to less than
   1280, but must include a Fragment header in those packets so that the

   IPv6-to-IPv4 translating router can obtain a suitable Identification
   value to use in resulting IPv4 fragments.  Note that this means the
   payload may have to be reduced to 1232 octets (1280 minus 40 for the
   IPv6 header and 8 for the Fragment header), and smaller still if
   additional extension headers are used."

   For such legacy nodes, the receipt of a PTB message with a Next-Hop
   MTU less than 1280 will result in the above behavior regardless of
   the value in the Code field.  As a result, a link ingress node that
   returns this new kind of PTB message may receive future packets up to
   1280 bytes in length and containing a Fragment header with the More
   Fragments (MF) bit and Offset field set to 0.  The link ingress node
   should process these packets as an indication that the originating
   IPv6 node is a legacy node, and should not send further PTB messages.
   Instead, the link ingress node should perform ordinary link
   adaptation on these packets even though the process may be
   burdensome.
