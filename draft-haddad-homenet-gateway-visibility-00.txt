1.  Introduction

   With the expected proliferation of "smart home" networks, enabling
   multiple features and capabilities may require installing additional
   routers within the home that will connect to one or multiple home
   gateway (HGW(s)).  In such scenario, it can be useful for the HGW(s)
   to keep track of all IPv6 addresses configured by different types of
   end devices that get attached to the home network via router(s)
   connected to the HGW(s).

   This memo describes a mechanism designed to address this scenario by
   increasing the HGW visibility on the home network that it is serving,
   without incurring any change on the end devices.

3.  Motivation

   Future smart home networks are all about deploying new services
   within homes and enabling average users (i.e., the vast majority of
   Internet users) to easily interact with them.  For this purpose,
   enabling automatic services/features discovery as well as associated
   home device(s) configuration (i.e., specifically for end devices that
   are not directly connected to the HGW) is a useful feature to
   provide.  In fact, such feature would help assisting average user to
   seamlessly manage and configure home devices.

4.  Proposal

   For simplicity and better clarity, we consider in the following a
   home network composed of one HGW, two additional routers (R1) and
   (R2) and a set of home devices that are spread around the three
   network entities, i.e., both (R1) and (R2) are connecting a subset of
   home devices while the remaining ones are directly connected to the
   HGW.  Such topology is shown in figure 1.


                                -------
                               |  HGW  |
                                -------
                              /    |    \
                             D     |     \
                                   |      \
                                  ----     ----
                                 | R1 |   | R2 |
                                  ----     ----
                                /    \     /  \
                               D1    D2   D3   D4


                                 Figure 1

   In this topology, one home device (D) is attached to the HGW WLAN
   interface in addition to (R1) and (R2).  Two home devices {(D1),
   (D2)} are connected to (R1) and a second pair {(D3), (D4)} is
   connected to (R2).  Finally, we assume that the HGW is able to
   delegate prefixes to both routers, and home devices are using
   stateless address autoconfiguration (described in [RFC4862]), in
   order to generate their IPv6 addresses.

   Our goal is to keep the HGW fully aware of the four IPv6 addresses
   configured by the set of devices {D1, D2, D3, D4} despite not being
   directly connected to the HGW.

   Our suggested proposal is described in the following steps:

   a.  when delegating prefixes to (R1) and (R2) as described in
       [RFC3633], the HGW issues an explicit request to get notified
       about IPv6 addresses that appears on each router link, i.e., IPv6
       addresses configured using the corresponding delegated prefix.
       Such request can be sent to the requesting routers (i.e., (R1)
       and/or (R2)) by inserting, for example, a new IA_PD option in the
       DHCP (Reply) message sent by the delegating router (i.e., HGW).

   b.  upon receiving a request to convey IPv6 addresses that are
       (auto)-configured using the delegated (and advertised) prefix,
       (R1) proceeds to collect and store all IPv6 addresses which pass
       the duplicate address detection (DAD) procedure performed on its
       link.  In our example, (R1) should convey to HGW all IPv6
       addresses that are configured by (D1) and (D2) while (R2) should
       convey the addresses that are configured by (D3) and (D4).

   c.  (R1) sends the collected IPv6 addresses to HGW using one (or
       multiple) new ICMP unicast message called "ICMP Notify
       (ICMP_NTY)".  Such message may be sent whenever a new IPv6
       address is successfuly tested on the link or may be used to carry
       a set of IPv6 addresses.  Other parameter(s) that are specific to
       the end device may also be sent in the ICMP_NTY message, along
       with the device's IPv6 address(es) (e.g., MAC address).

   d.  After receiving a valid ICMP_NTY message, the HGW SHOULD send an
       acknowledgment to the sending router.  For this purpose, we
       introduce another ICMP message called "ICMP Notify Acknowledgment
       (ICMP_NTA)".  It follows that ICMP_NTA message MUST be sent only
       by the delegating router.

   Note that the pair of new ICMP messages is also used to convey IPv6
   addresses to the HGW when end devices configure their IPv6 addresses
   using DHCPv6 mechanism (described in [RFC3315]).

   In more complicated scenarios, (R1) can be directly connected to one
   or multiple routers on the downstream path in which case, the prefix
   delegation functionality is not limited to the HGW.  In such case,
   the suggested IPv6 address notification procedure requires the
   requesting router to send the ICMP_NTY messages directly to the HGW.
   For this purpose, the HGW address is sent by the delegating router in
   the DHCP Reply message (e.g., using another IA_PD option).
