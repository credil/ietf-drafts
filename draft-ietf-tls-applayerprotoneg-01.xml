      <t>
      This document describes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension for application layer protocol 
      negotiation within the TLS handshake. For instances in which the TLS connection is established over 
      a well known TCP/IP port not associated with the desired application layer protocol, this extension 
      allows the application layer to negotiate which protocol will be used within the TLS session.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Increasingly, application layer protocols are encapsulated in the TLS security protocol <xref target="RFC5246"/>. 
      This encapsulation enables applications to use the existing, secure communications links already present on 
      port 443 across virtually the entire global IP infrastructure.</t>

      <t>When multiple application protocols are supported on a single server-side port number, such as port 443, 
      the client and the server need to negotiate an application protocol for use with each connection. It is 
      desirable to accomplish this negotiation without adding network round-trips between the client and the server,
      as each round-trip will degrade an end-user's experience. Further, it would be advantageous to allow 
      certificate selection based on the negotiated application protocol.</t>

      <t>This document specifies a TLS extension which permits the application layer to negotiate protocol selection 
      within the TLS handshake. This work was requested by the HTTPbis WG to address the negotiation of HTTP version 
      (<xref target="RFC2616"/>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/>) over TLS, however ALPN facilitates negotiation 
      of arbitrary application layer protocols.</t>

      <t>With ALPN, the client sends the list of supported application protocols as part of the TLS ClientHello 
      message. The server chooses a protocol and sends the selected protocol as part of the TLS ServerHello message. 
      The application protocol negotiation can thus be accomplished within the TLS handshake, without adding network 
      round-trips, and allows the server to associate a different certificate with each application protocol, if 
      desired.</t>

      <section title="The Application Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension">
        <t>
        A new extension type ("application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16)") is defined and MAY be included by the client in
        its "ClientHello" message.
        </t>

enum {
	application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16), (65535)
} ExtensionType;
        ]]></artwork>
		</figure>

        <t>The "extension_data" field of the ("application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16)") extension SHALL contain a "ProtocolNameList" value.</t>

        <figure>
        <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
opaque ProtocolName<1..2^8-1>;

struct {
	ProtocolName protocol_name_list<2..2^16-1>
} ProtocolNameList;
        ]]></artwork>
		</figure>

	<t>"ProtocolNameList" contains the list of protocols advertised by the client, in descending order of preference. Protocols are named by IANA 
		registered, opaque, non-empty byte strings, as described further in Section 6 "IANA Considerations" of this document. Implementations 
		MUST ensure that an empty string is not included and that no byte strings are truncated.</t>

	<t>Experimental protocol names, which are not registered by IANA, will start with the following sequence of bytes: 0x65, 0x78, 0x70 ("exp").</t>

        <t>Servers that receive a client hello containing the "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension, MAY 
        	return a suitable protocol selection response to the client.  The server will ignore any protocol name that 
		it does not recognize.  A new ServerHello extension type ("application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16)") MAY be returned to the client within 
		the extended ServerHello message.  The "extension_data" field of the ("application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16)") extension SHALL be 
		structured the same as described above for the client "extension_data", except that the "ProtocolNameList" MUST contain exactly one 
		"ProtocolName".
		</t>

        <t>
        Therefore, a full handshake with the "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension in the ClientHello and ServerHello messages
		has the following flow (contrast with section 7.3 of <xref target="RFC5246"/>):

      <section title="Protocol Selection">
      
        <t>It is expected that a server will have a list of protocols that it supports, in preference order, 
        and will only select a protocol if the client supports it.  In that case, the server SHOULD select
        the most highly preferred protocol it supports which is also advertised by the client.  In the event
        that the server supports no protocols that the client advertises, then the server SHALL respond
        with a fatal "no_application_protocol" alert.</t>

        <figure>
        <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
enum {
	no_application_protocol(120),
	(255)
} AlertDescription;
        ]]></artwork>
		</figure>

	<t>The "no_application_protocol" fatal alert is only defined for the "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension and MUST NOT 
	be sent unless the server has received a ClientHello message containing this extension.</t>

        <t>The protocol identified in the "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension type in the ServerHello SHALL be definitive for
        the connection.  The server SHALL NOT respond with a selected protocol and subsequently use a different
        protocol for application data exchange.</t>
        
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Design Considerations">
      <t>
      The ALPN extension is intended to follow the typical design of TLS protocol extensions.  Specifically,
		the negotiation is performed entirely within the client/server hello exchange in accordance with
		established TLS architecture.  The "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" ServerHello extension is intended to
		be definitive for the connection and is sent in plaintext to permit network elements to provide
		differentiated service for the connection when the TCP/IP port number is not definitive for the
		application layer protocol to be used in the connection.  By placing ownership of protocol selection 
		on the server, ALPN facilitates scenarios in which certificate selection or connection rerouting 
		may be based on the negotiated protocol.
      </t>

		<t>Finally, by managing protocol selection in the clear as part of the handshake, ALPN avoids introducing 
		false confidence with respect to the the ability to hide the negotiated protocol in advance of establishing the connection.
		If hiding the protocol is required, then renegotiation after connection establishment, which would provide true
		TLS security guarantees, would be a preferred methodology.
		</t>

		<t>A namespace will be assigned for experimental protocols, comprising byte strings which start with the following 
		sequence of bytes: 0x65, 0x78, 0x70 ("exp"). Assignments in this namespace do not need IANA registration.
		</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
      The ALPN extension does not impact the security of TLS session establishment or application data exchange.  ALPN
      serves to provide an externally visible marker for the application layer protocol associated with the TLS
      connection.  Historically, the application layer protocol associated with a connection could be ascertained from
      the TCP/IP port number in use.  
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      
      <t>
		The IANA has updated its Registry of TLS ExtensionType Values to include the following entry:
		</t>
		
		<t> - 16	application_layer_protocol_negotiation</t>
        
      <t>
		This document also requires the IANA to create a registry of Application Layer Protocol Negotiation 
		protocol byte strings, initially containing the following entries:
		</t>

      <t> - "http/1.1": HTTP/1.1 <xref target="RFC2616"/>;</t>

      <t> - "http/2.0": HTTP/2.0 <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/>;</t>

      <t> - "spdy/1": (obsolete) SPDY version 1;</t>

      <t> - "spdy/2": SPDY version 2;</t>

      <t> - "spdy/3": SPDY version 3.</t>
        
    <t>We propose that this new registry be created in a new page entitled: "Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" beneath the
	existing heading of "Transport Layer Security (TLS)".</t>
