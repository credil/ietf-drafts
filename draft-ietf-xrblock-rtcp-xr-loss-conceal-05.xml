    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report
      (XR) Block that allows the reporting of Burst and Gap Loss metrics for
      use in a range of RTP applications.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <section title="Burst and Gap Loss Report Block">
        <t>This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
        <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> for use in a range of RTP applications.
        The new block type supports the reporting of the proportion of packets
        lost by the network. The losses during loss bursts are reported,
        together with the number of bursts and additional data allowing the
        calculation of statistical parameters (mean and variance) of the
        distribution of burst lengths. Some uses of these metrics depend on
        the availability of the metric "cumulative number of packets lost"
        from RTCP <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This block provides information on transient IP problems. Burst/Gap
        metrics are typically used in Cumulative reports however MAY be used
        in Interval reports. The burstiness of packet loss affects user
        experience, may influence any sender strategies to mitigate the
        problem, and may also have diagnostic value.</t>

        <t>The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end system
        metrics defined in <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The definitions of Burst, Gap, Loss and Discard are consistent with
        definitions in <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>. To accommodate the
        range of jitter buffer algorithms and packet discard logic that may be
        used by implementors, the method used to distinguish between bursts
        and gaps may be an equivalent method to that defined in <xref
        target="RFC3611"></xref>. The method used SHOULD produce the same
        result as that defined in [RFC3611] for conditions of burst packet
        loss, but MAY produce different results for conditions of time varying
        jitter.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
        <t>The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defined an
        extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
        This document defines a new Extended Report block for use with <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance Metrics Framework">
        <t>The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target="RFC6390"></xref>
        provides guidance on the definition and specification of performance
        metrics. The RTP Monitoring Architectures <xref
        target="RFC6792"></xref> provides guideline for reporting block format
        using RTCP XR. The Metrics Block described in this document are in
        accordance with the guidelines in <xref target="RFC6390"></xref> and
        <xref target="RFC6792"></xref>. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications which
        don't use stream repair means.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <section title="Standards Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

        <t>In addition, the following terms are defined:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Received, Lost and Discarded"><vspace
            blankLines="1" />A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to
            arrive within an implementation-specific time window. A packet
            that arrives within this time window but is too early or late to
            be played out or thrown away before playout due to packet
            duplication or redundancy shall be regarded as discarded. A packet
            shall be classified as one of received (or OK), discarded or lost.
            The metric "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in <xref
            target="RFC3550"></xref> reports a count of packets lost from the
            media stream (single SSRC within single RTP session). Similarly
            the metric "number of packets discarded" defined in <xref
            target="DISCARD"></xref> reports a count of packets discarded from
            the media stream (single SSRC within single RTP session) arriving
            at the receiver. Another metric defined in <xref
            target="RFC5725"></xref> is available to report on packets which
            are not recovered by any repair techniques which may be in use.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

            <t hangText="Bursts and Gaps"><vspace blankLines="1" />The terms
            Burst and Gap are used in a manner consistent with that of RTCP XR
            [RFC3611]. RTCP XR views a RTP stream as being divided into
            bursts, which are periods during which the loss rate is high
            enough to cause noticeable quality degradation (generally over 5
            percent loss rate), and gaps, which are periods during which lost
            packets are infrequent and hence quality is generally acceptable.

      <section title="Derived metrics based on reported metrics">
        <t>The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
        this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
        Information block <xref target="RFC6776"></xref> (which MUST be
        present in the same RTCP packet as the Burst/Gap Loss block) and also
        with the metric "cumulative number of packets lost" provided in
        standard RTCP <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

        <t>These metrics provides information relevant to statistical
        parameters, including:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The fraction of packets lost during bursts (i.e., Burst Loss
            Rate in <xref target="SUMSTAT"></xref>)</t>

            <t>The fraction of packets lost during gaps (i.e., Gap Loss Rate

    <section title="Considerations for Voice-over-IP applications">
      <t>This metric block is applicable to a broad range of RTP applications.
      Where the metric is used with a Voice-overIP (VoIP) application and the
      stream repair means is not available, the following considerations
      apply.</t>

      <t>RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
      during which the loss rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
      quality degradation (generally over 5 percent loss rate), and gaps,
      which are periods during which lost packets are infrequent and hence
      call quality is generally acceptable.</t>

      <t>If Voice Activity Detection is used the Burst and Gap Duration shall
      be determined as if silence packets had been sent, i.e. a period of
      silence in excess of Gmin packets MUST terminate a burst condition.</t>

      <t>The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in [RFC3611] results in
      a Burst being a period of time during which the call quality is degraded
      to a similar extent to a typical PCM Severely Errored Second <xref
      target="PSES"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="SDP Signaling">
      <t>[RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol) <xref
      target="RFC4566"></xref> for signaling the use of XR blocks. XR blocks
      MAY be used without prior signaling.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>In many standards track documents several words are used to
            signify the requirements in the specification. These words are
            often capitalized. This document defines these words as they
            should be interpreted in IETF documents. Authors who follow these
            guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of
            their document: <list>
                <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
                "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
                "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
                in RFC 2119.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Note that the force of these words is modified by the
            requirement level of the document in which they are used.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
