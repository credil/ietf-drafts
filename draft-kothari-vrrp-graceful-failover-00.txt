Abstract

   This memo defines the use of priority zero in VRRP to failover from
   the Master router to one of the Backup routers either by operator
   input (i.e. manual failover) or automatically (e.g. on uplink
   interface going down). The procedure tries to be graceful (i.e.
   minimize outage) wherever possible. It is especially helpful in cases
   where preemption is disabled to avoid unnecessary churn.

Internet Draft           VRRP Graceful Failover           August 2, 2013


1.  Introduction

   Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC5798] defines priority
   zero for the purpose of indicating that the Master router has stopped
   participating in VRRP and the Backup routers should quickly
   transition to Master without waiting for the current Master to
   timeout. It defines it's use only during the Shutdown event in Master
   State.

   This memo defines a new "Change event" and also makes priority zero
   for VRRP a user configurable value. It defines it use under this new
   "Change event" in Master state to initiate a failover to the Backup
   router especially when preemption is disabled. It uses a make before
   break approach to minimize outage wherever possible.

   This document is being discussed on the vrrp@ietf.org mailing list.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.2.  Updates to Section 6-4-3 of RFC5798: Master

   A Change event would be triggered by change in any one of the
   following parameters of the VRRP Packet:

      1)  "Priority" Section 5.2.4 of [RFC5798]

      2)  "Maximum Advertisement Interval (Max Adver Int)" Section 5.2.7
          of [RFC5798]

      3)  "IPvX Address(es)" Section 5.2.9 of [RFC5798]

   Handling of the Change event is only applicable in Master state as
   VRRP packets are not sent in other states.

   <snip>

      (680) - If the Adver_Timer fires, or Change event is received,
      then:

         (685) + Send an ADVERTISEMENT

         (690) + Reset the Adver_Timer to Advertisement_Interval

      (695) -endif // advertisement timer fired or Change event received

      (700) - If an ADVERTISEMENT is received, then:

         (705) -+ If the Priority in the ADVERTISEMENT is zero, and
         Local Priority is greater than zero, then:

            (715) -* Reset the Adver_Timer to Advertisement_Interval

         (720) -+ else // ADVERTISEMENT priority non-zero or local
         priority was zero

           DESCRIPTION
             "This object specifies the priority to be used for the
             virtual router master election process; higher values
             imply higher priority.

             A priority of '0', is sent by the master router to
             indicate that it wants to release the Master
             responsibility, and a backup virtual router should
             transition to become a new master.

             A priority of 255 is used for the router that owns the
             associated IP address(es) for VRRP over IPv4 and hence
             is not setable.

             Setting the values of this object to 255 should be
             rejected by the agents implementing this MIB module.  
             For example, an SNMP agent would return 'badValue(3)' 
             when a user tries to set the values 255 for this 
             object."
