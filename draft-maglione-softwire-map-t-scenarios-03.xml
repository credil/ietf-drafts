    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Softwire working group is currently discussing both encapsulation
      and translation based stateless IPv4/IPv6 solutions developed for the
      purposes of offering IPv4 connectivity to the customers in an IPv6-Only
      environment.</t>

      <t>There are deployment scenarios that may benefit equally from an
      encapsulated or translated form of an IPv4/IPv6 stateless addressing
      solution. There are, however, use cases where using a translation
      approach could lead to significant operational benefits and potential
      savings for the operators.</t>

      <t>This document describes some use cases that would take advantage of a
      translation based solution, by highlighting the operational benefits
      that a translation based approach would allow.</t>

      <t/>
    </section>

    <section anchor="policy" title="Operational Service Policy Use Cases ">
      <t>In Broadband Networks it is common practice for Operators to apply
      per-subscriber policies on subscriber traffic at the network edge such
      as a BNG ( Broadband Network Gateway), CMTS (Cable Modem Termination
      System), PGW (PDN Gateway) or like device. Various services may require
      the application of different policies at these services edges.</t>

      <t>Typically a policy would include a classification function and an
      action function. <list style="symbols">
          <t>Service flow classification may occur based on any combination of
          the following:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Layer-3 identifiers such as source, destination address,
              protocol or next header, DSCP or Traffic Class;</t>

              <t>Layer-4 identifiers such as source or destination port;</t>

              <t>service type/destination (i.e. Internet, network service, or
              other service)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Actions may be provisioned against the classified traffic; the
          following are some examples of actions:<list style="symbols">
              <t>application of different QoS treatment (could be rate-limit,
              drop, redirect,.. etc) based on Layer 3 or higher layer (Layer
              4-7) classification from devices like deep packet inspection
              appliances;</t>

              <t>Service flow redirection on selected types of traffic (i.e.
              Web portal);</t>

              <t>Service flow caching on selected types of traffic.</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The rationale for applying such policy at the network edge is based
      on how tightly coupled this layer of the network is with many key
      systems within the operators network such as RADIUS, DHCP, access
      technology awareness and ability to implement subscriber awareness.</t>

      <t>In many common deployments today, the customer's policies are
      maintained in RADIUS server or enforced through other provisioned data
      in co-operation with service activation such as DHCP and bootstrap
      configuration. In a cable operator network, while much of the heavily
      lifting of subscriber management is embedded on the CMTS or OLT, the
      reality is that classification is shared across CMTS and cable-modem
      (CM) or across OLT and optical network unit (ONU.) The CM and ONU
      classification capabilities are not as robust and flexible as the
      upstream CMTS, OLT and/or assisting edge router. The implications of
      that are that the CPE may need to be replaced with a device that has the
      capability to classify on a larger packet header.</t>

      <t>An additional point to consider is that the edge network nodes are
      also often fitted with, or co-located with higher functioning appliances
      that employ Deep Packet Inspection and distributed caches used to
      enhance service performance.</t>

      <section anchor="acl"
               title="Network/Transport Layer Classification classifiers">
        <t>Most of the policies described in <xref target="policy"/> require
        the use of network and transport layer classification and filtering
        mechanisms such as classifiers at the network edge. The application of
        classifiers and other network layer classification functions on
        selected subscriber flows are often applied by a AAA server, gleaned
        from configuration information, provisioned from per-CM DOCSIS
        configuration files generated from the operator OSS, or sent by a
        policy control function (PCRF, PCMM, etc).</t>

        <t>This section will explain why the application of some types of
        classifiers (like Layer 3 destination based classifiers and - Layer 3
        plus Layer 4 - classifiers,) can be deployed in a more simplistic
        fashion when using a translated form of a stateless IPv4/IPv6
        transition technology such as MAP-T <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t"/>.</t>

        <t>A key characteristic of MAP-T is the mapping of the IPv4 address of
        any destination into the IPv6 destination address, by means of IPv4 to
        IPv6 mapping rules. This mapping means that the subscriber flows are
        native IPv6 flows within the operators network. The ability to use a
        standard IPv6 classifier to identify interesting traffic for
        classification is well aligned with traditional traffic identification
        capabilities using IPv4 based classifiers. Such classifiers can be
        easily applied at the access edge as a standard function commonly
        available on most platforms deployed.</t>

        <t>In contrast, a solution utilizing an IP tunnel based transport
        (MAP-E <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"/> or DS-Lite <xref
        target="RFC6333"/>), effectively hides the payload's IP layer
        information, making it difficult to identify by means of an IPv6
        classifier . The operator in the latter case (tunneled option) would
        need additional functionality to classify the same subscriber flows
        which may not be available on the deployed platforms.</t>

        <t>The classifier use case is further extended when considering that
        many traffic classifications are made using transport layer (Layer 4)
        information. This is common in operator networks that often apply
        differential traffic treatment to different services that typically
        operate using well defined TCP/UDP ports. In the MAP-T deployment
        case, these ports are available for classification matching using the
        same standard access edge node capabilities using IPv6 classifiers. In
        the case where tunneled forms of a solution are used, these higher
        layer ports are hidden from the network (base IP layer) and special
        functionality to correctly classify these service flows is
        required.</t>

        <t>The ability to apply classifiers at the access edge node allows the
        operator to not only use standard IPv6 classifier functionality, but
        also use same mechanisms (RADIUS interface parameters/system, or
        DOCSIS configuration classifier parameters) for applying such
        classifiers. I.e. custom RADIUS interface extensions or custom DOCSIS
        classifier extensions to deal with the classifier semantics of an IP
        tunnel based transport are not required.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Device Configuration (DOCSIS)">
        <t>Some access technologies, like DOCSIS, require a modem
        configuration file for network operation. These configuration files
        often contain access control and classification information that uses
        IPv4 and/or IPv6 network and transport layer information.</t>

        <t>MAP-T allows use of standard IPv6 classifiers within these
        configuration files permitting the continued use of the well-known
        service architecture. Translation technologies which use tunneling may
        require the operator to update how services are managed as information
        needed to enforce policy is not longer viewable by the Cable Modem or
        upstream CMTS. The operator in this case may need to build new service
        capabilities higher up in the network after the network translator to
        apply the full range of polices for the subscriber base.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Flow management using Deep Packet Inspection">
        <t>Several Service Providers today use Deep Packet Inspection devices
        located at the network edge (such as a BNG) in order to inspect the
        subscriber's traffic for different purposes: profiling the user's
        behavior, and classifying the traffic based on higher layer
        information and/or traffic signatures.</t>

        <t>Deep packet inspection devices available today in the market and,
        more importantly, those already deployed in operator's network may not
        be able to analyze encapsulated traffic, like IPinIP, and to correlate
        the inner packet's contents to the outer packet's "subscriber" context
        - this limitation is consistent across multiple vendors. In order to
        overcome this limitation when using IP tunnel based transports,
        without resorting to costly network upgrades, dedicated DPI devices
        need to be applied at a point in the network where the IP tunnel
        transport has been stripped and the payload is directly available for
        native processing. This not only changes the network architecture, but
        it increases the number of DPI's devices required: one for IPv6
        traffic at the access edge, the other at a location where the IPv4
        traffic is exposed (typically a separate Location). In addition the
        operator would need to enforce policies at two architecturally
        separate places in the network. Furthermore, even with these changes
        enacted, there remains a critical problem of correlating traffic to a
        given subscriber: in encapsulation based solutions, the IPv4 address
        information in the payload is not sufficient to uniquely identify a
        subscriber given that an IPv4 address will not be unique. As such,
        additional mechanisms and changes to the accounting infrastructure
        need to be introduced which when combined with all the previous
        aspects makes this solution operationally complex.</t>

        <t>With MAP-T operators can continue using the current architectural
        model with DPI devices installed at the access edge; the only
        requirement would be to have the same device able to recognize
        specific applications on the native IPv6 transport, which DPI devices
        based on application signatures are capable of doing. Thus with MAP-T
        it doesn&rsquo;t matter that an operator might provision the same IPv4
        address across multiple subscribers. In addition with MAP-T the access
        edge would remain the single enforcement point for all user's policies
        for all traffic. This would allow the operators to continue using a
        consistent architecture and set of accounting tools for their
        network.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="redirect"
               title="Service Flow Redirection Policies (Web-redirection)">
        <t>Redirecting the user's traffic to web portal is a common practice
        in Service Provider networks. For example, it is common for operators
        to inform users about new services, service advisories and/or access
        to account changes using web-reduction techniques activated on http
        traffic. In current deployments web-redirection occurs at the Edge
        node level, where the subscriber's traffic first hits the IP network.
        The activation/de- activation of redirection policy on selected
        subscribers may be driven by the AAA/RADIUS through specific RADIUS
        attributes. In current deployments web-redirection occurs at the Edge
        node level, where the subscriber's traffic first hits the IP network.
        The activation/de- activation of redirection policy on selected
        subscribers may be driven by the AAA/RADIUS through specific RADIUS
        attributes.</t>

        <t>If MAP-T is used the redirection of both IPv6 and IPv4 traffic can
        be kept at the Edge of the network with the same configuration
        currently used and by simply translating the Server's address in IPv6
        with known mapping rules. In case of tunnel based solution the
        redirection of IPv6 and IPv4 cannot occur in a single place, because
        the redirection of IPv4 traffic must be implemented at or after the
        v4/v6 gateway responsible for de-encapsulating the traffic. This
        approach not only would require deploying two separate infrastructures
        located in different places in order to achieve the redirection for
        both IPv6 and IPv4 traffic, but also it would not allow continuing
        using the AAA/RADIUS Server infrastructure in order to enforce the
        redirect policy at the subscriber's session.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Flow Caching ">
        <t>With the continuing growing of video traffic, especially
        considering the increase of http video traffic (YouTube like,) it is
        useful for the Service Providers to be able to cache the video stream
        at the Edge of the network in order to save bandwidth on upstream
        links. Using cache devices together with tunnel solutions would
        introduce similar challenges/issues as the ones described for DPI
        scenarios, in particular it would require applying caching
        functionality after the decapsulation point. Obviously this would not
        eliminate the benefits of the cache. Instead a MAP-T approach would
        allow caching the subscriber traffic at the edge of the network and
        gaining the bandwidth savings introduced by the caching. Crucially,
        any native IPv6 web-caches would be capable of processing IPv6 MAP-T
        traffic as fully native traffic.</t>

        <t>In addition in some deployments today, Web Cache Control Protocol
        (WCCP) feature is used in order to redirect subscriber&rsquo;s traffic
        to the cache devices. When a subscriber requests a page from a web
        server (located in the Internet, in this case), the network node where
        the WCCP is active, sends the request to a Cache Engine. If the cache
        engine has a copy of the requested page in storage, the engine sends
        the user that page. Otherwise, the engine gets the requested page and
        the objects on that page from the web server, stores a copy of the
        page and its objects (caches them), and forwards the page and objects
        to the user. WCCP is another example of web redirect thus, the same
        considerations described in section <xref target="redirect"/> and the
        benefits introduced by MAP-T also apply here.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Technological Considerations">
      <t>There are additional technological considerations which need to be
      analyzed by the operator when choosing which transition technology
      option they would like to deploy. This section describes some of those
      considerations.</t>

      <section title="Encapsulation and Translation Overhead">
        <t>MAP-E adds an encapsulation tax of 40 bytes, while MAP-T adds a
        translation tax of 20 bytes (translating from a 20-byte IPv4 header to
        a 40-byte IPv6 header.) In the downstream direction (from network
        toward the CPE), with an average packet size of 1000-1100 bytes, the
        added encapsulation is under 4% in the case of MAP-E. In the case of
        MAP-T that encapsulation tax drops to about 2%.</t>

        <t>In the upstream direction, with an average packet size of ~400
        bytes, the effects of the encapsulation tax is more pronounced with an
        added 10% overhead for MAP-E and 5% additional overhead for MAP-T. As
        the upstream direction tends to be both (a) more heavily
        oversubscribed than is the downstream and (b) of lower performance,
        the greater the header tax the more it upsets the precariously
        balanced upstream/ downstream network loading models.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Efficient Utilization of the Access Network">
        <t>Point-to-Multipoint access networks are common across network
        operators - DOCSIS (1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0), EPON, 10G-EPON, GPON,
        XGPON,XGPON2, etc. This network type has been incredibly successful,
        as attested to by all the variants of point-to-multipoint networks
        deployed, primarily because of their cost effectiveness.</t>

        <t>There are a couple challenges that are introduced by adding a
        significant amount of encapsulation overhead. These challenges affect
        MAP-T and MAP-E similarly; the effects from MAP-E are simply more
        pronounced.</t>

        <t>The first challenge is that, commonly, point-to-multipoint networks
        have limited support for jumbo frames. The second challenge is one
        that results in reduction in effective capacity on the wire, which
        yields higher cost.</t>

        <section title="Jumbo Frame Support in the Access">
          <t>Some access technologies natively support fragmentation, and as a
          result, can support "jumbo frames" up to a point. A max size IPv4
          packet that fits into the payload of a standard-compliant Ethernet
          frame is 1500 bytes. In the context of this discussion a "jumbo
          frame" is any Ethernet frame that has more than 1500 bytes in the
          Ethernet payload. IEEE Std. 802.3 now specifies a larger frame size
          of up to 2000 bytes, referred to as an envelope frame, where the
          envelope frame, quoting from IEEE Std.802.3-2012 "is intended to
          allow inclusion of additional prefixes and suffixes required by
          higher layer encapsulation protocols. The encapsulation protocols
          may use up to 482 octets."</t>

          <t>In the network access space, particularly one filled with legacy
          access products which may be 10 years old (or perhaps older), it is
          not uncommon to find products that just only support a max 1500 byte
          Ethernet payload. Some may support up to 1532 byte payload (1550
          byte Ethernet frame), some 1582 byte payload (1600 byte Ethernet
          frame), though there's certainly not a uniform supported frame size
          past the 1500 byte payload.</t>

          <t>Since MTU discovery isn't typically used for IPv4 in operator
          networks and since MTU discovery for IPv6 is not implemented on the
          IPv4 host stack requesting the communication, there's no effective
          way to tell the host stack to reduce the size of its IPv4 frame to
          accommodate the MAP-T or MAP-E overhead with the MTU frame size
          limitation of the specific access products. There are tools like
          Maximum Segment Size rewrite that can be implemented to help address
          the issue for a TCP payload but UDP payload will continue to be
          impaired.</t>

          <t>Thus MAP-T is preferred as there are more deployed access
          products that could support a 1534-byte or 1538-byte Ethernet frame
          than can support a 1554-byte or 1558-byte Ethernet frame, which
          mandates fewer access product replacements.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Operator Added Packet Overhead and Service Level Agreements">
          <t>One of the traditional challenges with adding additional packet
          overhead to a customer frame is that it becomes more challenging to
          provide customer the last-mile bandwidth in their SLA. This is a
          very simple overprovisioning problem when the maximum size frame is
          used, as the overhead in that case is a fixed ~1.5% or ~3% for MAP-T
          and MAP-E respectively.</t>

          <t>However in the case of variable packet sizes, the added overhead
          from either MAP-T or MAP-E can become very significant - from a
          worse case of ~31% (MAP-T) and ~63% (MAP-E) to the ~1.5% or ~3%.
          This means that to provide the customer what they purchased
          operators will either provision more than the customer SLA to
          account for the added overhead or abide by the "not guaranteed"
          bandwidth response.</t>

          <t>With the average upstream packet sizes being smaller, the 5%
          (MAP-T) or 10% (MAP-E) added overhead for the average upstream
          packet size could find itself in an overprovisioned QoS profile.</t>

          <t>Many customers, particularly business customers, are very savvy
          and have a strong belief that when a network operator offers them an
          SLA, it's not an SLA at a specific packet size. This can be a
          significant operational difficulty for network operators, one with a
          real operational cost.</t>

    <section title="Conclusions">
      <t>The use cases described in this document have highlighted a clear
      need for a MAP-T solution based on Service Providers&rsquo; operational
      requirements.</t>

      <t>This document showed that a MAP-T approach is not a duplication of
      any other existing IPv4/IPv6 migration mechanisms based on IP tunneling,
      but actually has capabilities to solve Service Provider&rsquo;s
      problems.</t>
