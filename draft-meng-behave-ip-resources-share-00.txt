                draft-meng-behave-ip-resources-share-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a solution to enable IP addresses sharing
   among multiple CGN devices, including requesting and releasing IP
   addresses.  Through this solution, the operators can make the dynamic
   sharing of IP addresses, improve the IP address sharing rate, realize
   resources'optimization, provide a more convenient platform for
   operators to manage of IP address pools.  In addition, due to the
   unified management of IP addresses from the AAA server, CGN device
   MAY reboot without provisioned IP address pools.

Internet-Draft          Share pools among Devices         September 2012


1.  Introduction

   With the depletion of IPv4 addresses, Network Address Translation (
   NAT ) technology has been widely used.  However, the address
   resources cannot be dynamically shared among multiple CGN ( Carrier
   Grade NAT) devices.  Currently, NAT public address pools are directly
   or indirectly configured in CGN devices, this may cause the some CGN
   devices rich and the other CGN devices poor of address resources.

   For the operators, the total number of IP addresses is limited.  The
   imbalance of user number in periods and regions often results that IP
   address resources sometimes are surplus and sometimes are
   insufficient.

   For example, both region "A" and "B" have N public IP addresses.
   Region "A" organizes a large-scale activity, which leads too many
   people flow to region "A" from region "B".  It results that : Region
   "A" lacks of IP addresses heavily, while Region "B" resources
   utilization rate drops to nearly 0%.

3.  Module Classify

   In order to realize the IP address sharing, each CGN device requires
   the following modules:

3.1.  User configuration module

   1)Priority configuration

   2)Requesting threshold configuration

   3)Releasing threshold configuration

   4)Releasing strategy

   5)Requesting step

   6)Hold-down time after failed requesting

3.2.  IP address resources requesting/releasing module

   The IP address resource requesting/releasing module is used to
   calculate the rate of idle resources, then decide whether CGN devices
   requests or releases IP addresses.  This module can be carried out
   for the following operations:

   1)Calculating the rate of idle resources

   2)Processing RADIUS messages

3.3.  IP address resources management module

   The IP address resources management module is used to manage IP
   address resources, such as implementing out the releasing strategy in
   the released state.

3.4.  AAA server management module

   The AAA server management module is used to manage the whole IP
   address resources by operators.  This module can be carried out for
   the following operations:

   1)Pool management

   2)Priority management

   3)Logging management

   to a CELL.  CELL is the base management unit of IP address requesting
   or releasing .

4.2.2.  Manage the priority

   The AAA server manages all CGN devices!_ priority and corresponding
   CELLs.  When receives the first message of IP address resource
   requesting, AAA server allocates several CELLs according to the



Meng, et al.             Expires March 31, 2013                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Share pools among Devices         September 2012


   priority of the requesting message.  The priority level is different
   amang CGN devices, and the assigned number of CELLs SHOULD be
   different too.

4.2.3.  Manage logging

   The AAA server enables logging management, used for recording the
   logging information for follow-up query.

   Logging management includes following fields:

   1)Time stamp

   2)Device number ( identify the device who requests or releases IP
   addresses)

   3)The assigned IP addresses

   4)Message type ( request, release)

   5)The execution result ( success, failure)

4.3.  The CGN device configuration

4.3.1.  Configure the priority of CGN device

   The priority determines the requesting ability about CELL number, so
   it SHOULD be configured when CGN device initializes.  The number of
   CELLs has its upper limit and lower limit.The priority is only for
   the preliminary requesting of IP address resource.In particular, the
   CGN device need not to configure any address pool itself.

4.3.2.  Configure requesting/releasing threshold(the threshold can be
        calculated as the rate of idle resources)

   Because the PAT mapping is based on protocols, and the same port can
   be multiplexed by any protocols, so the threshold needs distinct
   protocols.

   Specifically, when the resource idle rate of ANY protocol is lower
   than the requesting threshold, it triggers CGN device to re-request
   one or more CELLs.

   For the releasing threshold, when resource idle rate of ALL protocols
   is higher than the releasing threshold, it triggers CGN device to
   release one or more CELLs.

   In practical application, requesting threshold SHOULD be greater than



Meng, et al.             Expires March 31, 2013                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Share pools among Devices         September 2012


   the releasing threshold.

   1)The algorithm of resources sum of a protocol is : 65535* the number
   of IP addresses

   2)The algorithm of idle resources of a protocol is: the sum of unused
   ports of each IP address

   3)The algorithm of resources idle rate of a protocol is: idle
   resources / resources sum

   The protocol includes but not limited to TCP , UDP , ICMP.  When the
   resource idle rate of any kind of unicast protocol is lower than the
   requesting threshold, it will trigger CGN device to request one or
   more IP address resource CELLs; The resource idle rate of all kind of
   unicast protocols is higher than the releasing threshold, it will
   trigger the CGN device to release one or more CELLs;

   If the address pools distinguish between NAT type and PAT type,
   single IP address in NAT type occupies 65535 resources, this means a
   NAT session occupies 65535 resources.

   The algorithm of resource idle rate is also applicable to CGN mapping
   mode (EIM/ADM/APDM ), filter mode (EIF/ADF/APDF) etc..

4.3.3.  Configure the releasing strategy

   When the resource idle rate is higher than the releasing threshold,
   and CGN sessions occupies all CELLs, this means in any CELL, at least
   one IP address is occupied by CGN session.  Then there is no CELL can
   be released.  This is called released state.  From this moment,
   creating follow-up sessions is upon the releasing strategy.  The
   releasing strategy can be one of the following cases:

   1)Focus strategy;

   Namely, under the released state, assigning IP addresses for new
   sessions will to focus on one CELL.  The each remaining CELL SHOULD
   wait for all of the corresponding sessions to be aging or manually
   removed, then release the CELL.

   2)Arbitrary stategy

   Namely, under the released state, select the least sessions CELL, and
   the CELL is forbidden to be used by the new session.  And then delete
   all the sessions belong to this CELL and release this CELL.

   3)Neglect strategy



Meng, et al.             Expires March 31, 2013                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          Share pools among Devices         September 2012


   Namely, under the released state, if there is no idle CELL ( idle
   CELL refers to the CELL without IP address occupied by the session ),
   new session ignore the released state, and assign IP address
   resources to generate the session just like before.  When any idle
   CELL exists, this CELL releasing process starts.

4.3.4.  Configure the step

   The definition of the step of CELL is that how many CELLs CGN device
   can request from the AAA server each time.  Supposing that the step
   is assigned 3, when the resource idle rate reached the requesting
   threshold, CGN device requested 3 CELLs from the AAA server.

   In practical application, the CGN device is initialized after the
   preliminary requesting of CELLs number according to the priority,
   when next time resource idle rate reaches the requesting threshold,
   CGN device can request CELLs number according to the assigned step.

4.3.5.  Configure hold-down time after failed requesting/releasing

   Supposing that , assigned hold-down time after failed requesting/
   releasing is T1, namely, if one requesting or releasing message gets
   no response or gets reject response, another requesting or releasing
   message should not be sent to AAA server in T1 time.

5.  IP address requesting/releasing procedure

5.1.  A CGN device preliminary requesting of IP addresses

5.1.1.  Normal procedure, see Figure 6

   Step 1

   Start a CGN device, initialize NAT module, and it requests IP
   addresses to a AAA server through RADIUS message.  It sends a RADIUS
   message encapsulated "Address-Request" in code field ( see Figure 1
   ), device number ( see Figure 2 ) and priority ( see Figure 3 ) in
   attribute field.

   Step 2

   After the AAA server receives a RADIUS message about IP address
   requesting, AAA server allocate a CELL according to the priority in
   this message.  Then it encapsulats a RADIUS message with "Address-
   Request-Reply" , device number ( see Figure 2 ) and CELL ID and IP
   addresses ( see Figure 4 ) in attribute field.

   If it needs to send multiple CELLs, repeat encapsulating as above
   before the message be sent.

   Step 3

   When the CGN device receives the RADIUS message encapsulated
   "Address-Request-Reply", it loads CELL(s) or IP addresse(s) into its
   data management system.  Then it sends a RADIUS message to the AAA
   server encapsulated "Address-Request-Reply-Ack" in code filed and
   device number ( see Figure 2 ) in attribute field.  Now, CGN device
   initialization complete.

5.1.2.  Abnormal procedure

   Case 1 ( see Figure 7 )

   In the Normal procedure step 1 mentioned above, after the CGN device
   sending a RADIUS message to the AAA server for the IP addresses
   requesting, the CGN device does not receive response from AAA server.
   At this point, CGN device will continue to send same requesting
   message for N times.  If there is still no response from AAA server,
   the CGN device SHOULD stop initializing and send alarm.

                                procedure)

   Case 2 ( see Figure 8 )

   In the Normal procedure step 2 above, if the AAA server found that
   there was not enough CELL(s) to be assigned to the CGN device, it
   will send RADIUS message to the CGN device encapsulated "Address-
   Request-Reject" ( see Figure 1 ) in code field and device number (
   see Figure 2 ) in attribute field.  If the CGN device receives the
   message, it SHOULD stop initializing and send alarm.

   Case 3 ( see Figure 9 )

   If the AAA server did not receive "Address-Request-Reply-Ack" message
   from CGN device after step 3 of the Normal procedure.  Then the AAA
   server will try to send "Address-Request-Reply" message to the CGN
   device again for N times until recieve the response from CGN device.
   Finally, if it still not receive "Address-Request-Reply-Ack" message
   ( note the CGN device failure or communication problems), lock
   CELL(s) and send alarm.

     Figure 9: A CGN requests IP addresses with CGN failure (Abnormal
                                procedure)

   Case 4

   When the CGN device is running, the device MAY restart for plenty of
   reasons.  Then the AAA server receives "Address-Request" message
   (Preliminarily Requesting) similar to that of step 1 from the CGN
   device which has just restarted, and find that it has already
   assigned CELL(s) to related CGN device.  Then the AAA server will
   send all CELL(s) with "Address-Request-Reply" message similar to that
   of step 2 to the CGN device.

5.2.  A CGN device re-requests IP addresses

5.2.1.  Normal procedure, see Figure 6

   Step 1

   When a CGN device is running, it MAY create sessions sequentially.
   Once a session is created, the CGN device will compare the rate of
   idle resources with the value of requesting threshold that be
   configured before, according to a session belongs to a certain

   protocol.

   Step 2

   If the rate of idle resources is lower than the configured requesting
   threshold, the CGN device will send a RADIUS message encapsulated
   "Address-Request" in code field ( see Figure 1 ), device number ( see
   Figure 2 ) and step ( see Figure 5 ) in attribute field.

   Step 3

   Receiving the RADIUS message, the AAA server allocate appropriate
   number of CELLs according to the value of step carried in the
   message.  Then it sends RADIUS message encapsulated "Address-Request-
   Reply" in code field, device number ( see Figure 2 ), CELL ID and IP
   addresses ( see Figure 4 ) in attribute field.  If it needs to send
   multiple CELLs, repeat encapsulating as above.

   Step 4

   When the CGN device receives the RADIUS message encapsulated
   "Address-Request-Reply", it loads CELL(s) or IP addresse(s) into its
   data management system.  Then it sends a RADIUS message to the AAA
   server encapsulated "Address-Request-Reply-Ack" in code filed and
   device number ( see Figure 2 ) in attribute field.  Now, CGN device
   initialization complete.

5.2.2.  Abnormal procedure

   Case 1( see Figure 8 )

   In step 3 of Normal procedure, if the AAA server finds that there is
   not enough CELL(s) to be assigned to the CGN device, it will send a
   RADIUS message to the CGN device encapsulated "Address-Request-
   Reject" ( see Figure 1 ) in code field and device number ( see Figure
   2 ) in attribute field.  If the CGN device receives the message, it
   will set hold-down time ,e.g.  T1.  It means that the CGN device MUST
   not re-send requesting message during T1.

   Case 2( see Figure 7 )

   In step 2 of Normal procedure, after the CGN device send a RADIUS
   message to the AAA server for the IP addresses requesting, the CGN
   device does not receive response from AAA server.  At this point, CGN
   device will continue to send the same requesting message for N times.
   If the CGN device receives the message, it will set hold-down time
   ,e.g.  T1.  It means that the CGN device MUST not re-send requesting
   message during T1.

   Case 3 ( see Figure 9 )

   After the Normal procedure step 4 above, the AAA server did not
   receive "Address-Request-Reply-Ack" message from CGN deviece.  Then
   the AAA server will try to send "Address-Request-Reply" message to
   the CGN device again for N times until recieve the response from CGN
   device. finally, if it still not receive "Address-Request-Reply-Ack"
   message ( note the CGN device failure or communication problems),
   lock CELL and send alarm.

5.3.  A CGN device releases IP addresses

5.3.1.  Normal procedure, see Figure 10

   Step 1

   When a CGN device is running, it MAY delete session occasionally
   because of sessions aging or manually deleting.  Once the CGN device
   delete a session, CGN device will compare the rate of the idle
   resources with the value of releasing threshold according to protocol
   the session belongs to.

   Step 2

   If the rate of the idle resources is lower than configured releasing
   threshold, CGN device will check whether there is any idle CELL(s).
   Idle CELL means that any IP address belong to the CELL is not
   assigned to sessions.

   Step 3

   If there is a idle CELL, CGN device will send a RADIUS message
   encapsulated "Address-Release" in code field ( see Figure 1 ), device
   number ( see Figure 2 ), CELL information ( see Figure 4 )in
   attribute field.

   Step 4

   If there is no idle CELL, CGN device will create new sessions
   according to releasing policy until aging or deleting cause creating
   idle CELL(s).

   Step 5

   When AAA server receiving a RADIUS message about "Address-Release",
   it releases the specific CELL(s) and sends a message encapsulated
   "Address-Request-Reply" in code field ( see Figure 1 )to CGN device.

   Step 6

   When CGN device recieving the message about "Address-Release-Reply",
   it will release the IP address resources and delete the CELL(s) in
   its configuration.

5.3.2.  Abnormal procedure

   Case 1( see Figure 11 )

   In step 5 Normal procedure, if the AAA server find that it cannot
   complete the releasing process, it will send a RADIUS message to the
   CGN device encapsulated "Address-Release-Reject" ( see Figure 1 ) in
   code field and device number ( see Figure 2 ) in attribute field.  If
   the CGN device receives the message, it will set hold-down time ,e.g.
   T1.  It means that the CGN device MUST not re-send requesting message
   during T1.

   In step 6 of Normal procedure, after the CGN device sends a RADIUS
   message to the AAA server for the IP addresses releasing, the CGN
   device does not receive response from AAA server.  At this point, CGN
   device will continue to send the same releasing message for N times.
   If the CGN device receives the message, it will set hold-down time
   ,e.g.  T1.  It means that the CGN device MUST not re-send requesting
   message during T1.

5.4.  Other exceptional procedure

   Case 1

   CGN device SHOULD have duplicate checking function, i.e. when
   continuously receiving the "Address-Request-Reply" or other types of
   message, the device SHOULD make continuous "Address-Request-Reply-
   Ack" response or other appropriate message, but the same CELL in CGN
   device MUST not be re-received;

   Case 2

   Once a CGN device breaks down, AAA server MUST support manually
   releasing CELL(s) which have assigned to the CGN device.

   Case 3

   Priority of a CGN device determines the upper limit and lower limit
   of CELL number( operator decisions ).  When the CGN device CELL
   number reaching a lower limit, do no more releasing operation.  When
   the upper limit of CELL number is reached, do no more requesting
   operation.

   Case 4

   When CGN device is in requesting or releasing procedure, it is not
   allowed for other requesting or releasing operations at the same
   time.
