Abstract

   DS-Lite Multicast [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast] is a solution
   to offer multicast service on DS-lite circumstance.  DS-Lite
   Multicast requires pre-configuration of the IPv4-embedded IPv6
   prefixes information on the multicast Basic Bridging BroadBand (mB4)
   element and multicast Address Family Translation Router(mAFTR).  This
   document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
   (RADIUS) attribute to carry the DS-Lite multicast prefixes
   information; the RADIUS attribute is defined based on the equivalent
   DHCPv6 OPTION_PREFIX64 option.

Internet-Draft   RADIUS Extensions for DS-Lite Multicast       July 2012


1.  Introduction

   DS-Lite Multicast [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast] is a solution
   to offer multicast service on DS-lite circumstance.This solution
   relies upon a stateless translation to built part of the IPv6
   multicast distribution tree and IPv4 multicast distribution tree,
   also uses IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation scheme to deliver IPv4 multicast
   traffic over an IPv6 multicast-enabled network to IPv4 receivers.

   But how do the mB4 element and the mAFTR element pre-provision the
   multicast source and multicast group IPv4-embedded IPv6 prefixes to
   fulfill the stateless translation and encapsution?

   To inform the mB4 element and the mAFTR element of the multicast
   prefixes, [I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option] defines a
   DHCPv6 option that is meant to be used by a mB4 element and a mAFTR
   to convey the IPv6 prefixes to be used for constructing these IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 address.  In order to be able to populate such an
   option, the DHCPv6 server must be pre-provisioned with the multicast
   prefixes.

   In broadband environments, a customer profile may be managed by
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, together
   with AAA for users.  The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
   (RADIUS) protocol [RFC2865] is usually used by AAA servers to
   communicate with network elements.  Since the DS-Lite multicast
   prefixes information can be stored in AAA servers and the client
   configuration is mainly provided through DHCP running between the NAS
   and the requesting clients, a new RADIUS attribute is needed to send
   DS-Lite multicast prefixes information from the AAA server to the
   NAS.

   This document defines a new RADIUS attribute to be used for carrying
   the DS-Lite Multicast prefixes, based on the equivalent DHCPv6 option
   already specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option]

3.  DS-Lite multicast prefixes Configuration with RADIUS and DHCPv6

   Figure 1 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work together
   to accomplish DS-Lite multicast prefixes configuration on the mB4
   element and the mAFTR element for multicast service.

   Figure 1: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Multicast prefixes attribute Message Flow

   The NAS operates as a client of RADIUS and as a DHCP Server of mB4.
   When the mB4 initially sends a DHCPv6 Solicit message to NAS(DHCP
   Server).  The NAS initially sends a RADIUS Access-Request message to
   the RADIUS server, requesting authentication.  Once the RADIUS server
   receives the request, it validates the sending client, and if the
   request is approved, the AAA server replies with an Access-Accept
   message including a list of attribute-value pairs that describe the
   parameters to be used for this session.  This list MAY also contain
   the Multicast Prefixes attribute (asm-length,ASM_PREFIX64,ssm-length,
   SSM_PREFIX64,unicast-length,U_PREFIX64).Then,when the NAS receives
   the DHCPv6 Request message containing the OPTION_PREFIX64 option,the
   NAS SHALL use the prefixes returned in the RADIUS DS-Lite Multicast
   prefixes attribute to populate the DHCPv6 OPTION_PREFIX64 option in
   the DHCPv6 reply message.

   If the NAS does not receive the Multicast prefixes attribute in the
   Access-Accept message, it MAY fall back to a pre-configured default
   multicast prefixes, if any.  If the NAS does not have any pre-
   configured, the delivery of muticast traffic is not supported.

   Figure 2 describes another scenario, which mB4 may be initiated by
   another user behavior rather than ethernet, for example,PPP dial-up.
   The NAS also obtains the Multicast Options from the AAA server
   through the RADIUS protocol.  When an user is online and sends DHCPv6
   Request , the NAS replies OPTION_PREFIX64 option in DHCPv6 Reply
   message.


          mB4                                NAS                      AAA
        |                                  |                      Server

        |                                  |     Prefixes)           |
        |-------  DHCPv6 Request  -------->|                        |
        |                                  |                        |
        |                                  |                        |

        |     (DHCPv6 OPTION_PREFIX64 )    |                        |


   Figure 2: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Multicast prefixes attribute Message Flow

   According to [RFC3315], if the DHCPv6 server to which the DHCPv6
   Renew message was sent at time T1 has not responded, the DHCPv6
   client initiates a Rebind/Reply message exchange with any available
   server.  In this scenario, the NAS receiving the DHCPv6 Rebind
   message MUST initiate a new Access-Request message towards the AAA
   server.  The NAS MAY include the Multicast prefixes attribute in its
   Access-Request message.

4.  RADIUS Attribute

   This section specifies the format of the new RADIUS attribute.

4.1.  DS-Lite Multicast Prefixes

   The DS-Lite Multicast Prefixes attribute conveys the IPv6 prefixes to
   be used in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast] to synthesize IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 addresses.  The NAS SHALL use the IPv6 prefixes
   returned in the RADIUS DS-Lite Multicast Prefixes attribute to
   populate the DHCPv6 PREFIX64 Option
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option] .

   A summary of the DS-Lite Multicast Prefixes RADIUS attribute format
   is shown Figure 3.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   The length for the ASM IPv4-emebdded IPv6 prefix in bits.  If the
   field is set to 0, all bits of ASM_PREFIX64 field MUST be set to
   zeros.

   ASM_PREFIX64:

   This field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be used to
   synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast groups.
   The conveyed multicast IPv6 prefix MUST belong to the ASM range
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] (i.e., ffxx:
   8000/17).

   ssm-length:

   The length for the SSM IPv4-emebdded IPv6 prefix in bits.  If the
   field is set to 0, all bits of SSM_PREFIX64 field MUST be set to
   zeros.

   SSM_PREFIX64:

   This field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be used to
   synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast groups.
   The conveyed multicast IPv6 prefix MUST belong to the SSM range
   defined in [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] (i.e.,
   ff3x:0: 8000/33).

   unicast-length:

   The length for the unicast IPv4-emebdded IPv6 prefix in bits.  If the
   field is set to 0, all bits of U_PREFIX64 field MUST be set to zeros.

   U_PREFIX64:

   This field identifies the IPv6 unicast prefix to be used in SSM mode
   for constructing the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast
   sources.  It may also used to extract the IPv4 address from the
   received multicast data flows.  The address mapping MUST follow the
   guidelines documented in [RFC6052].
