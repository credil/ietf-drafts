Internet-Draft          RD mRSVP TE Requirements              March 2012


1.  Introduction

   For content delivery services that rely upon the IP multicast
   transmission scheme, the distribution trees are receiver-initiated.
   The delivery of such services over MPLS networking infrastructures
   may rely upon P2MP LSP tree structures that are currently source-
   initiated, with the root of the P2MP tree being at the LSR router
   directly connected to the sender ([RFC4875].

   Multiparty multimedia applications are getting greater attention in
   the telecom world.  Such applications are QoS-demanding and can
   therefore benefit from the activation of MPLS traffic engineering
   capabilities that lead to the dynamic computation and establishment
   of MPLS LSPs whose characteristics comply with application-specific
   QoS requirements.

   P2MP-RE-REQ[RFC4461] specifies the signalling requirements to setup
   multipoint LSPs from source to receiver.  P2MP-TE [RFC4875] defines
   the procedure to setup multipoint LSPs from source to receiver.

   This document presents a set of requirements specific for the dynamic
   establishment and maintenance of receiver-driven P2MP-TE and MP2MP-TE
   LSPs.

1.1.  Motivation

   IP multicast distribution trees are receiver-initiated and dynamic by
   nature.  IP multicast-enabled applications are also bandwidth savvy,
   especially in the area of residential Live TV broadcasting services,
   where several hundreds of thousands of IPTV receivers need to be
   served with the appropriate level of quality.  Current source-driven
   P2MP LSP establishment assumes a prior knowledge of receiver(s)
   location for the sake of the P2MP LSP tree structure's forwarding
   efficiency.  But the receiver's location information is not available
   a priori for the root MPLS router to compute and establish the
   relevant P2MP tree structure.  In addition, with the source-driven
   P2MP-TE solution, full mesh P2MP LSP tree structures need to be
   established to setup a MP2MP LSP, possibly raising scalability issues
   for the delivery of some multicast services, such as
   videoconferencing at large scale.

   From this perspective, it is believed that receiver-driven MPLS P2MP
   tree structures represent the best of breed that combines the
   benefits of IP multicast, receiver-driven dynamics with the benefits
   of MPLS-based, QoS-guaranteed LSP path computation.

   Thus, receiver-driven MPLS P2MP/MP2MP tree structure do not require
   that the root of the MPLS P2MP tree structure dynamically discovers

   and maintains receiver information a priori.  In addition, such a
   receiver-driven approach encourages computation schemes that can take
   into account the network access conditions of the receivers
   (bandwidth capabilities, IPTV customer profile, etc.) for the sake of
   customer's Quality of Experience (time to access an IPTV channel,
   time to zap fron one channel to another, etc.).

1.2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:>

   o  Sender: Sender refers to the source of the content/payload.  As in
      [RFC2205].

   o  Receiver: Receiver refers to the Receiver of the content/payload.
      As in [RFC2205].

   o  Upstream: The direction of a flow from a content Receiver towards
      a content Sender.  As defined in [RFC2205].

   o  Downstream: The direction of a flow from a content Sender towards
      a content Receiver.  As defined in [RFC2205].

   o  Path-Sender: The sender of the RSVP_PATH message, with NO
      correlation to the directionality of the corresponding content
      flow.

   o  Path-Receiver: The receiver of the RSVP_PATH message, with NO
      correlation to the directionality of the corresponding content
      flow.

   o  Path-Initiator: The Path-Sender that originated the RSVP_PATH
      message.  The Path-Initiator is a notion that differs from the
      Path-Sender because an intermediate node can be a Path-Sender, and
      therefore different from the node that created and initiated the
      RSVP_PATH message, which is precisely the Path- Initiator.

   o  Path-Terminator: The Path-Receiver that does NOT propagate the
      Path message.  This is a notion that differs from the Path-
      Receiver because an intermediate node can be a Path-Receiver.

1.3.  What is not covered in this doc?

   This document does not specify any requirements for the following
   functions.

2.  Basic Requirements

   [RFC4461] specifies requirements for P2MP traffic engineering over
   MPLS.  It describes sender-driven P2MP traffic engineering in detail.
   Those definitions and requirements are equally applicable to
   receiver-driven traffic engineering in a point-to-multipoint service
   environment and are therefore not repeated here.

   Following are key requirements that are specific to the receiver-
   driven paradigm:

   REQ1:   The receiver-driven P2MP/MP2MP approach must be scalable,
           i.e., the dynamic computation and maintenance of P2MP/MP2MP
           tree structures must be adapted to typical live TV
           broadcasting services that connect several hundreds of
           thousands of receivers.

   REQ2:   Leaves of receiver-driven P2MP/MP2MP tree structures must be
           aware of the corresponding P2MP/MP2MP LSP identifiers for
           tree computation and maintenance purposes.

   REQ3:   The receiver-driven mechanism MUST allow the dynamic addition
           and removal of leaves to and from a P2MP/MP2MP tree
           structure, without any restriction (provided there is network
           connectivity) .  It is RECOMMENDED that the corresponding
           operations be leaf-initiated.

   REQ4:   The dynamic addition and removal of leaves to and from a
           receiver-driven P2MP/MP2MP LSP MUST not impact the
           performances of the data forwarding (packet loss,
           replication, delay) towards other leaves.

   REQ5:   The dynamic addition and removal of leaves to and from a
           receiver-driven P2MP/MP2MP LSP SHOULD NOT infer any
           additional processing than that on the path from the added/
           removed Leaf LSR to the Branch LSR.

   REQ6:   A Leaf router MUST initiate RSVP PATH message towards the
           root and also signal the type of the LSP.

   REQ7:   The destination of a L2S (Leaf-to-Source) sub-path MUST be
           one of the ingress routers where multicast data sent by a
           source enter the P2MP/MP2MP LSP tree structure.

   REQ8:   RSVP P2MP PATH messages MUST be forwarded along the path from
           a given leaf to the root of the P2MP tree structure.

   REQ9:   RSVP P2MP RESV messages MUST be frowarded along the path from
           the root to the receiver if the leaf is the MPLS router that
           directly connects receivers to the corresponding receiver-
           driven P2MP tree structure .  Otherwise, RSVP P2MP RESV
           messages will be forwarded from the PATH Terminator to the
           PATH Initiator.

   REQ10:  A node receiving a RSVP RESV message SHOULD interpret it as a
           successful resource reservation from the upstream node for
           the establishment of the P2MP tree structure.

   REQ11:  A node receiving a RSVP RESV message SHOULD interpret it as a
           successful resource reservation from the downstream node for
           the establishment of the MP2MP tree structure.

   REQ12:  Label allocation on incoming interface MUST be done prior to
           sending RSVP PATH messages upstream for P2MP tree structures.

   REQ13:  Label allocation on incoming interface MUST be done prior to
           sending RSVP RESV messages upstream for MP2MP tree
           structures.

   REQ14:  For P2MP LSP tree structures, a node receiving a RSVP PATH
           message MUST first decide if this RSVP PATH message will make
           itself a branch LSR or not.  In the case that it will become
           a transit LSR because of this PATH message, then it will
           allocate required resources on the interface through which
           the RSVP PATH message is received, before sending the RSVP

           PATH message upstream.  So that the upstream node can send
           traffic soon after successfully reserving resources on the
           downstream link, on which the RSVP PATH message SHOULD be
           received.  In the case that the node is a branch or transit
           node already before it receives the PATH message, then it
           will allocate required resources (provided they are
           available) on the interface through which the RSVP PATH
           message is received, and then send the RESV message back to
           the node that sent the PATH message without sending the PATH
           message upstream.

   REQ15:  For MP2MP LSP tree structures, a node will allocate required
           resources on the interface through which the RSVP PATH
           message is sent, before sending the RSVP PATH message
           upstream.  A node receiving a RSVP PATH message MUST first
           decide if this RSVP PATH message will make itself a branch
           LSR or not.  In the case that it will become a transit LSR
           because of this PATH message, and then allocate required
           resources (provided they are available) on the interface
           through which the RSVP PATH message was received and will
           allocate required resources on the interface through which
           the RSVP PATH message is sent, before sending it upstream.
           So that the downstream node can send traffic soon after
           successfully reserving resources on the upstream link, on
           which the RSVP PATH message SHOULD be sent.  The upstream
           node can then send traffic soon after successfully reserving
           resources on the downstream link, on which the RSVP PATH
           message SHOULD be received.  In the case that the node is a
           branch or transit node already before it receives the PATH
           message, then it will allocate required resources on the
           interface through which the RSVP PATH message is received,
           and send the RESV message to the node which sent the PATH
           message without sending the PATH message upstream.

   Figure 1 shows that R5 is added as the first leaf of the RD P2MP TE
   LSP, the message flow goes from
   R5->msg1->R3->msg2->R1->msg3->R3->msg4->R5.  When the leaf R4 is
   added, the message flow goes from R4->msg5->R3->msg6->R4.  In this
   case, when R3 receives msg5, R3 finds out that the RD P2MP LSP has
   already been set up for R5: therefore, R3 finds itself a branch node
   for leaf R4 and R5, so it will terminate the PATH message and build
   the corresponding RESV message and send it back to R4.  The
   association of the LSP initiated by R4 to the existing RD P2MP LSP is
   determined based on the processing of the session object from the
   mRSVP-TE message.  This session object is further documented in
   Section 2 of this draft.

   Figure 2 shows that R5 is added as the first leaf (as both a sender
   and a receiver) of the RD MP2MP TE LSP, the message flow goes from
   R5->msg1->R3->msg2->R1->msg3->R3->msg4->R5.  When the leaf R4 (both
   receiver and sender)is added, the message flow goes from
   R4->msg5->R3->msg6.  In this case, when R3 receives msg5, R3 finds
   out that the RD MP2MP LSP has already been set up for R5, and R3 will
   become the branch LSR for the leaf R4 and R5, so it will terminate
   the PATH message, build a RESV message and send the RESV message back
   to R4.  The association of the LSP initiated by R4 to the existing
   MP2MP LSP is determined based on the processing of the session object
   from the mRSVP-TE message.  This session object is further documented
   in Section 2 of this draft.

4.  Detailed Requirements

4.1.  Leaf Driven mRSVP-TE LSP

   The Receiver-Driven RSVP-TE extensions MUST be applicable to the
   signaling of P2MP LSPs for different switching types.  For example,
   it MUST be possible to signal a P2MP/MP2MP TE LSP in any switching
   medium, whether it is packet or non-packet based (including frame,
   cell, TDM, lambda, etc.).

   As with P2P MPLS technology [RFC3031], a given traffic is associated
   with a FEC in this extension.  All packets that belong to a
   particular FEC and that travel from a particular node MUST follow the
   same Receiver- Driven P2MP/MP2MP tree structure.

   In order to scale to a large number of branches, P2MP/MP2MP TE LSPs
   SHOULD be identified by a unique identifier (the P2MP/MP2MP ID) that
   is constant for the whole LSP regardless of the number of branches
   and/or leaves.

4.2.  P2MP TE LSP Establishment, Teardown, and Modification Mechanisms

   The Receiver-Driven P2MP LSP approach MUST support the dynamic
   establishment, maintenance, and teardown of Receiver-Driven P2MP/
   MP2MP LSPs in a manner that the scalability is not affected by the
   number of leaves, and it is scalable in a linear way to the number of
   branches for a node.  This MUST imply the ability to compute to
   compute multiple P2MP tree structures at once, and to compute P2MP/
   MP2MP LSP tree structures are that composed of many leaves, i.e.,
   within the magnitude of typical Live TV broadcasting designs that
   accommodate several hundreds of thousands of receivers.

   In addition to signaling capabilities for P2MP/MP2MP LSP
   establishment and teardown, the solution SHOULD support capabilities
   that allow the dynamic modification of part of a given P2MP/MP2MP
   tree structure without altering the whole structure:

   For the purpose of adding sub-P2MP TE LSPs to an existing P2MP/MP2MP
   TE LSP, the extensions SHOULD support a grafting mechanism.  For the
   purpose of deleting a sub-P2MP TE LSP from an existing P2MP/MP2MP TE
   LSP, the extensions SHOULD support a pruning mechanism.

   It is RECOMMENDED that these grafting and pruning operations cause no
   additional processing in nodes that are not along the path from the
   grafting or pruning node to the upstream branch node.  Moreover, both
   grafting and pruning operations MUST NOT disrupt the forwarding of
   traffic along the P2MP/MP2MP tree at any given time.

Internet-Draft          RD mRSVP TE Requirements              March 2012


   There is no assumption that the explicitly routed P2MP/MP2MP LSP
   remains on an optimal path after several grafts and prunes have
   occurred.  In this context, scalability considerations refer to the
   signaling process for the P2MP/MP2MP TE LSP .  The TE nature of the
   LSP allows that re- optimization may take place from time to time to
   restore the optimality of the LSP.

4.3.  Re-Optimization of Leaf Driven mRSVP-TE LSPs

   The detection of a more optimal path (for example, one with a lower
   overall cost) is an example of a situation where re-routing of the
   Receiver-Driven P2MP/MP2MP LSP may be required.  While re-routing is
   in progress, an important requirement is to avoid double bandwidth
   reservation (over the common parts between the old and new LSP)
   through the use of resource sharing.

   A Make-before-break design MUST be supported for Receiver-Driven
   P2MP/MP2MP LSPs to ensure that there is minimal traffic disruption
   during the re-routing operations.

   Make-before-break that only applies to a sub-P2MP tree without
   impacting the data on all the other parts of the P2MP tree MUST be
   supported.

   The solution SHOULD allow for make-before-break re-optimization of
   any subdivision of the P2MP LSP.  It SHOULD do so by not having any
   signaling impact on the rest of the P2MP LSP, and without affecting
   the ability of the management plane to manage the LSP.

   The solution SHOULD also provide the ability for any downstream LSR
   to have control over the re-optimization process .

   Where sub-LSP re-optimization is allowed by the ingress LSR, such re-
   optimization MAY be initiated by a downstream LSR that is the root of
   the sub-LSP to be re-optimized.  Sub-LSP re-optimization initiated by
   a downstream LSR MUST be carried out with the same regard to
   minimizing the impact on active traffic as mentioned above for other
   re-optimization purposes.

4.4.  Support for LAN interfaces

   Receiver-Driven P2MP/MP2MP LSPs may be used to traverse network
   segments that are provided by multi-access media such as Ethernet.
   In these contexts, it is also possible that the entry point to the
   network segment is a branch LSR of the Receiver-Driven P2MP/MP2MP
   LSP.

   To avoid all replicated data are sent through the same port and

Internet-Draft          RD mRSVP TE Requirements              March 2012


   carried on the same segment, the solution SHOULD provide a mechanism
   for a branch LSR to send a single copy of the data onto a multi-
   access network to reach multiple (adjacent) downstream nodes.

   The Receiver-Driven P2MP/MP2MP computation mechanism SHOULD provide a
   means for a Branch LSR to send a single copy of the data onto an
   Ethernet LAN interface to reach multiple adjacent downstream nodes.
   This requires that the same label be negotiated with all downstream
   LSRs for the P2MP/MP2MP LSP.

   When there are several candidate upstream LSRs on a LAN interface,
   the RD P2MP TE mechanism SHOULD provide a means for all downstream
   LSRs of a given P2MP LSP to select the same upstream LSR, so as to
   avoid traffic replication.  In addition, the RD P2MP TE mechanism
   SHOULD allow for an efficient balancing of a set of P2MP LSPs among a
   set of candidate upstream LSRs on a LAN interface.

4.5.  P2MP/MP2MP MPLS Label

   A solution for the dynamic establishment and maintenance of Receiver-
   Driven P2MP LSPs MUST allow the continued use of existing techniques
   to establish P2P and legacy P2MP LSPs (TE and otherwise) within the
   same network, and MUST allow the coexistence of Receiver-Driven P2MP/
   MP2MP LSPSs with P2P and legacy P2MP LSPs within the same network.

   A solution for the dynamic establishment and maintenance of Receiver-
   Driven P2MP LSPs MUST be specified in such a way that it allows
   legacy P2MP and P2P TE LSPs to be signaled on the same interface.

4.6.  Advertisement of Leaf Driven mRSVP-TE Capability

   To facilitate the computation of Receiver-Driven P2MP trees using TE
   constraints within a network whose LSRs do not all support the same
   capability level with respect to Receiver-Driven P2MP RSVP-TE
   signaling and data forwarding, the capability of an LSR to support
   the RSVP-TE signaling and forwarding for Receiver-Driven P2MP LSPs
   MUST be advertised to its neighbor LSRs.

4.7.  Scalability

   Scalability is a key requirement in mRSVP-TE systems.  Solutions MUST
   be designed to scale well as a function of the number of any of the
   following:

   o  the number of receivers

   o  the number of sources

Internet-Draft          RD mRSVP TE Requirements              March 2012


   o  the number of egress LSRs

   o  the number of branch LSRs

   o  the number of branches

   Furthermore, scalability of control plane operation (setup,
   maintenance, modification, and teardown) MUST be considered.

   Key considerations MUST include:

   o  The amount of refresh processing associated with maintaining a
      P2MP/MP2MP TE LSP.

   o  The amount of protocol state that must be maintained by ingress
      and transit LSRs along a P2MP/MP2MP tree.

   o  The number of protocol messages required to set up or tear down a
      P2MP/MP2MP LSP as a function of the number of egress LSRs.

   o  The number of protocol messages required to repair a P2MP/MP2MP
      LSP after failure or to perform make-before-break.

   o  The amount of protocol information transmitted to manage a P2MP/
      MP2MP TE LSP (i.e., the message size).

   o  The amount of additional data distributed in potential routing
      extensions.

   o  The amount of additional control plane processing required in the
      network to detect whether an add/delete of a new branch is
      required, and in particular, the amount of processing in steady
      state when no add/delete is requested.

   o  The amount of control plane processing required by the ingress,
      transit, and egress LSRs to add/delete a branch LSP to/from an
      existing P2MP LSP.

   It is expected that the applicability of each solution will be
   evaluated with regards to the aforementioned scalability criteria.

   In order to accommodate a growing number of leaves, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the amount of a P2MP LSP/MP2MP state on a LSR, for one
   particular LSP, depends only on the number of adjacent LSRs on the
   LSP.

Internet-Draft          RD mRSVP TE Requirements              March 2012


4.8.  Variation of LSP Parameters

   Certain parameters (such as priority and bandwidth) are associated
   with an LSP.  The parameters are installed by the signaling exchanges
   associated with the establishment and the maintenance of the P2MP/
   MP2MP LSP.

   Any solution MUST NOT allow for variance of these parameters within a
   single P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  That is:

   o  Downstream or upstream LSRs MUST NOT alter the attributes set and
      signaled by a first leaf router of a P2MP/MP2MP tree structure.

   o  A consistent QoS policy SHOULD be enforced from the root to all
      leaves of a single P2MP/MP2MP LSP.

   o  Some leaves of a given tree may yield the enforcement of a
      different QoS policy, depending on the various access capabilities
      of the receivers.  Still, content will be delivered to these
      receivers by using the same (core) P2MP/MP2MP tree structure.

   o  Changing the parameters for the whole tree MAY be supported, but
      the change MUST apply to the whole tree from ingress LSR to all
      egress LSRs.


5.  In-Band Signalling

   TBD.


6.  Backwards Compatibility

   Any P2MP/MP2MP TE LSP solution SHOULD offer as much backward
   compatibility as possible.  Also, RD P2MP TE LSPs MUST be able to
   coexist with IP unicast and IP multicast networks.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define any protocol extensions and does not,
   therefore, make any changes to any security models.  It is a
   requirement that any RD P2MP/MP2MP solution developed to meet some or
   all of the requirements expressed in this document MUST include
   mechanisms to enable the secure establishment and management. of
   P2MP/MP2MP RSVP-TE LSPs.  This includes, but is not limited to:

   o  A receiver MUST be authenticated before it is allowed to trigger
      the establishment of an additional leaf of a RD P2MP LSP tree
      structure, in addition to hop-by-hop security issues identified in
      RFC 3209 and RFC 4206.

   o  mechanisms that provide some guarantees about the identity of an
      ingress LSR of a P2MP/MP2MP LSP;

   o  mechanisms to ensure that communicating signaling entities can
      verify each other's identities;

   o  mechanisms to ensure that control plane messages are protected
      against spoofing and tampering;

   o  mechanisms to ensure that unauthorized leaves or branches are not
      added to the P2MP/MP2MP LSP; and mechanisms to protect signaling
      messages from snooping.

   o  Note that RD P2MP/MP2MP signaling mechanisms built on P2P RSVP-TE
      signaling and RSVP-TE P2MP signalling are likely to inherit all
      the security techniques and problems associated with RSVP-TE.
      These problems may be exacerbated in P2MP/MP2MP situations where
      security relationships may need to be maintained between an
      ingress LSR and multiple egress LSRs.  Such issues are similar to
      security issues for IP multicast.
