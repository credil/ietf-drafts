Abstract

   PIM Sparse-Mode use a Rendezvous Point (RP) and shared trees to
   forward multicast packets to Last Hop Routers (LHR).  After the first
   packet is received by the LHR, the source of the multicast stream is
   learned and the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) can be joined.  This draft
   proposes a solution to support PIM Sparse Mode (SM) without the need
   for PIM registers, RPs or shared trees.  Multicast source information
   is distributed via Bootstrap Router [RFC5059] messages and flooded
   throughout the Multicast domain.  By removing the need for RPs and
   shared trees, the PIM-SM procedures are simplified, improving router
   operations, management and making the protocol more robust.

Internet-Draft        PIM source discovery via BSR          October 2011


1.  Introduction

   PIM Sparse-Mode uses a Rendezvous Point (RP) and shared trees to
   forward multicast packets to Last Hop Routers (LHR).  After the first
   packet is received by the LHR, the source of the multicast stream is
   learned and the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) can be joined.  This draft
   proposes a solution to support PIM Sparse Mode (SM) without the need
   for PIM registers, RPs or shared trees.  Multicast source information
   is distributed via Bootstrap Router [RFC5059] messages and flooded
   throughout the Multicast domain.  By removing the need for RPs and
   shared trees, the PIM-SM procedures are simplified, improving router
   operations, management and making the protocol more robust.

   BSR provides an infrastructure to advertise 'RP mappings' to all the
   routers in the Multicast network via Reverse Path Forwaring (RPF).
   This document proposes to use BSR to advertise Source Group (SG)
   mappings from the First Hop Router (FHR) to all the LHRs.  BSR seems
   like a good fit since its already designed to distribute 'mappings'
   through out the multicast network.  The requirements for distributing
   SG mappings seems very close to RP mappings, for that reason there
   seems no need to invent a new protocol.

2.  Source to Group Mappings via BSR

   A Candidate Bootstrap (C-BSR) router is typically a router which is
   configured to be a BSR.  Multiple C-BSR may be configured in the
   network and an election procedure is applied to select the Elected
   BSR (E-BSR) router.  The E-BSR router is the router that is
   responsible for distributing the Group to RP mappings.  See [RFC5059]
   section 3.1 for more details.  In order to distribute Source to Group
   (SG) mappings, there is no need to elect an E-BSR router.

2.1.  Originating SG BSR messages

   Each FHR that is directly connected to an active multicast source
   becomes the E-BSR for that SG mapping.  How a multicast router
   discovers the source of the multicast packet and when it considers it
   self the FHR follows the same procedures as the registering process
   described in [RFC4601].  After it is decided that a register needs to
   be sent, the SG is not registered via the PIM SM register procedures,
   but the SG mapping is distributed via a BSR message.  Note, only the
   SG mapping is distributed in the BSR message, not the entire packet
   as would have been done with a PIM register.  The router originating
   the BSR messages includes its own address in the BSR message.  The
   BSR messages are periodically sent for as long as the multicast
   source is active, similar to how PIM registers are periodically sent.
   The timer and timeout values described in [RFC5059] apply here as
   well.

2.2.  Forwarding SG BSR messages

   The forwarding of BSR messages follows the same procedures as
   documented in [RFC5059] section 3.4 and 3.5.

2.3.  Processing SG BSR messages

   A router that receives a SG BSR messages should parse the SG BSR
   message and store the SG mappings with a holdtimer started with the
   advertised holdtime for that group.  If there are directly connected
   receivers for that group this router should send PIM (S,G) joins for
   all the SG mappings advertised in the BSR message.  The SG BSR
   mappings is kept alive for as long as the holdtimer for the source is
   running.  Once the holdtimer expired a PIM (S,G) prune must be sent
   to remove itself from the tree.


3.  The first packets and bursty sources

   The PIM register procedure is designed to deliver Multicast packets
   to the RP in the absence of a native SPT tree from the RP to the



Wijnands, et al.         Expires April 22, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        PIM source discovery via BSR          October 2011


   source.  The register packets received on the RP are decapsulated and
   forwarded down the shared tree to the LHRs.  As soon as an SPT tree
   is built, multicast packets would flow natively over the SPT to the
   RP or LHR and the register process would stop.  The PIM register
   process bridges the gap between how long it takes to build the SPT
   tree to the FHR.  If the packets would not be unicast encapsulated to
   the RP they would be dropped by the FHR until the SPT is setup.  This
   functionality is important for applications where the first packet(s)
   must be received for the application to work correctly.  An other
   reason would be for bursty sources.  If the application sends out a
   multicast packet every 4 minutes (or longer), the SPT is torn down
   (typically after 3:30 minutes of inactivity) before the next packet
   is forwarded down the tree.  This will cause no multicast packet to
   ever be forwarded.  A well behaved application should really be able
   to deal with packet loss since IP is a best effort based packet
   delivery system.  But in reality this is not always the case.

   With the procedures proposed in this draft the packet(s) received by
   the FHR will be dropped until the LHR has learned about the source
   and the SPT tree is built.  That means for bursty sources or
   applications sensitive for the delivery of the first packet this
   proposal would not be very applicable.  This proposal is mostly
   useful for applications that don't have strong dependency on the
   first packet(s) and have a constant data rate, like video
   distribution for example.  For applications with strong dependency on
   the first packet(s) we recommend using PIM Bidir [RFC5015] or SSM
   [RFC4607].  The protocol operations are much simpler compared to PIM
   SM, it will cause less churn in the network and both guarantee best
   effort delivery for the first packet(s).

   An other solution to address the problems described above is
   documented in [I-D.ietf-magma-msnip].  This proposal allows for a
   host to tell the FHR its willingness to act as Source for a certain
   Group before sending the data packets.  LHRs have time to join the
   SPT tree before the host starts sending which would avoid packet
   loss.  The SG mappings announced by [I-D.ietf-magma-msnip] can be
   advertised directly into BSR, allowing a very nice integration of
   both proposals.  The life time of the SPT is not driven by the
   liveliness of Multicast data packets (which is the case with PIM SM),
   but by the announcements driven via [I-D.ietf-magma-msnip].  This
   will also prevent packet loss due to bursty sources.


4.  Resiliency to network partitioning

   In a PIM SM deployment where the network becomes partitioned, due to
   link or node failure, it is possible that the RP becomes unreachable
   to a certain part of the network.  New sources that become active in



Wijnands, et al.         Expires April 22, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        PIM source discovery via BSR          October 2011


   that partition will not be able to register to the RP and receivers
   within that partition are not able to receive the traffic.  Ideally
   you would want to have a candidate RP in each partition, but you
   never know in advance which routers will form a partitioned network.
   In order to be fully resilient, each router in the network may end up
   being a candidate RP.  This would increase the operational complexity
   of the network.

   The solution described in this document does not suffer from that
   problem.  If a network becomes partitioned and new sources become
   active, the receivers in that partitioned will receive the BSR SG
   Mappings and join the source tree.  Each partition works
   independently of the other partition(s) and will continue to have
   access to sources within that partition.  As soon as the network
   heals, the SG Mappings are re-flooded into the other partition(s) and
   other receives can join to the newly learned sources.


5.  Fragmentation of BSR messages

   [RFC5059] defines procedures to fragment BSR messages if the number
   of group to RP mappings is too large and the packet exceeds the MTU
   size.  Its important for PIM to have all the RP mappings before it
   applies the selection process.  Missing mappings may cause the wrong
   RP to be selected.  Using BSR to distribute SG mappings we don't have
   this problem.  There is no reason to have all the source before
   joining the tree.  There is no selection process applied to the SG
   mappings, all the known SG mappings should be joined by PIM.  For
   that reason there is no special fragmentation support defined for SG
   mappings.
