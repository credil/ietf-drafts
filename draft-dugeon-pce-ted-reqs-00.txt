   Path Computation Element (PCE) Traffic Engineering Database (TED)
                              Requirements
                      draft-dugeon-pce-ted-reqs-00

Abstract

   During the past 4 years, Path Computation Element (PCE) WG has
   produced a set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path
   Computation Element as a tool to help MPLS-TE LSP tunnels placement.
   In the PCE architecture, a main assumption has been done concerning
   the information that the PCE needs to perform its computation: the
   Traffic Engineering Database (TED) contains all pertinent and
   suitable information regarding the networks that is in the scope of a
   PCE.  Nevertheless, requirements and inventory of TED information
   have not been formalized.  In addition, some recent RFC (like BRPC
   RFC 5441) or WG draft (like draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy ...) suffer from
   a lack of information coming from the TED resulting to a non optimal
   result or some difficulties to deploy them.  This memo tries to
   identity all TED requirements for the PCE as well as provides some
   helps to operators to fulfill the PCE TED.

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


1.  Problem Statement

   Looking to the different RFCs that describe the PCE architecture and
   in particular RFC 4655 [RFC4655], RFC 5440 [RFC5440] and RFC 5441
   [RFC5441] as well as the draft H-PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-hierarchy-fwk],
   the Path Computation Element (PCE) need to acquire a set of
   information that are usually store in the Traffic Engineering
   Database (TED) in order to perform its path computation.  Even if
   intra-domain topology acquisition is well documented and known (e.g.
   by listen to the IGP-TE protocol that runs inside the network),
   inter-domain topology information, PCE peer address, neighbor AS ...
   that are necessary for the Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC)
   and the Hierarchical PCE are not documented and not well
   standardized.

   The purpose of this memo is to inventory the required information
   that should be part of the PCE TED and the different mechanism that
   allow an operator to fulfill it.

1.1.  PCE assumption and hypothesis

   In some cases both functions (path computation and TED management)
   are slightly coupled: border node identification, endpoint
   localization and topology aggregation for domain sequence
   selection,... to name a few in which an IGP-based TED may not be
   sufficient.  It is also important to differentiate several
   environments with different requirements for the multidomain problem.
   The PCE is scoped for any kind of network, from transport networks
   (TDM/WDM) with a rather limited number of domains, few
   interconnections, and few confidentiality issues, transport networks
   with a large number of domains, MPLS networks with several
   administrative domains, and big IP/MPLS networks with a large number
   of domains with peering agreements.  For each of them, a different
   solution for the multi-domain path computation may apply.  A solution
   may not be scalable for one, but perfect for another.

   Up to now, PCE WG has based its work and standard on the assumption
   and hypothesis that the TED contains all pertinent information
   suitable for the PCE to compute an optimal MPLS-TE LSP placement over
   the networks the PCE controls or a set of domains through BRPC
   algorithm.  We could identify two major sources of information for
   the TED:

   o  The intra-domain routing protocol like OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE

   o  The inter-domain routing protocol i.e.  BGP

   If the first source gives a precise and synchronize view of the

   controlled network, BGP just provides network reachability with only
   one AS path (unless using recent add path option).  Nevertheless, to
   optimize inter-domain path computation, like BRPC, route diversity
   and a minimum set of Traffic Engineering information about the
   foreign domains could be helpful.

1.2.  Terminology

   ABR: Area Border Routers.  Routers used to connect two IGP areas
   (areas in OSPF or levels in IS-IS).

   ASBR: Autonomous System Border Router.  Router used to connect
   together ASes of the same or different service providers via one or
   more inter-AS links.

   AS: Autonomous System

   Boundary Node (BN): a boundary node is either an ABR in the context
   of inter-area Traffic Engineering or an ASBR in the context of
   inter-AS Traffic Engineering.

   Domain: an Autonomous System

   Entry BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n-1) to domain(n) along
   a determined sequence of domains.

   Exit BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n) to domain(n+1) along
   a determined sequence of domains.

   Inter-area TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an IGP area boundary.

   Inter-AS TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an AS boundary.

   IGP-TE: Interior Gateway Protocol with Traffic Engineering support.
   Both OSPF-TE and IS-IS-TE are indentify in this category.

   PCE: Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application, or
   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

   PCE(i) is a PCE with the scope of domain(i).

   TED: Traffic Engineering Database.

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


   PCE TED in term of information that the database should contains

2.1.  MPLS Layer

   This section describes the IP layer information that are suitable for
   the PCE TED.

2.1.1.  Intra-domain

   This is the main part of the TED.  As the PCE controls the underlying
   networks, it MUST be aware of the precise details of the networks
   topology in order to compute the optimal Inter-area TE LSP path.  For
   that purpose, the TED MUST contains all information that allow the
   PCE to reconstitute the topology graph of the networks and at least:

   o  Border Nodes: This include both area and AS boundary nodes (ABR
      and ASBR),

   o  Internal Nodes: All nodes of the networks that are not border
      node,

   o  Internal Links that rely nodes (both internal and border nodes),

   o  External Links that rely the area or the AS to the other area or
      AS,

   o  Area number or Region level (depending of the IGP-TE),

   o  Traffic Engineering information of the different links (with e.g.
      recent metric extensions proposal OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE)
      Metric Extensions [I-D.ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions])

   All these information are exchange between the IGP-TE protocol
   (OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE).

2.1.2.  inter-domain

   Inter-domain information are mandatory when operator intend to use
   the PCE to compute Inter-AS TE LSP path that cross AS boundary.  For
   that purpose, the TED SHOULD contains all information that allow the
   PCE to determine the optimal AS path for the MPLS-TE LSP computation
   and at least:

   o  ASBR of the foreign domain,

   o  ASBR Links between ASBR i.e. links between Border Node (n) to
      Border node (n+1),

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


   o  Traffic Engineering of ASBR links as describe in RFC 5392
      [RFC5392] and in RFC 5316 [RFC5316],

   o  Traffic Engineering performance between Border Nodes (n) to give
      performance indication on foreign domain n,

   o  PCE (i) peer address associated with the AS number of the foreign
      domain (i),

   Unfortunately, only RFC 5316 and RFC 5392 could help to provide
   required TED information in the case of inter-domain.

2.2.  Optical Layer

   To be provided latter.

2.3.  Operational Information

   This part of the TED contains all others information pertinent for
   the PCE to compute TE LSP path but that are provided through the
   management system.


3.  TED Management

   This section aims to provide Best Current Practices when mechanisms
   are well-known and some hints when to standard solution exists to
   manage the PCE TED, and so give help to fulfill it.

3.1.  MPLS layer

3.1.1.  Intra-domain

   As the TED mainly contains the intra-domain topology graph, it is
   RECOMMENDED to link the PCE with the underlying IGP-TE (OSPF-TE or
   IS-IS-TE routing protocol).  By configuring the PCE as a source sink
   only, it is possible to listen to the routing protocol and then
   acquired the complete topology graph.  In addition, the TED will
   synchronize as fast as the routing protocol converges like any router
   in the domain.

   In addition, management tools like network vendors management system
   SHOULD be used to complement the topology graph provided by the
   routing protocol.

Internet-Draft                PCE TED Req.                    March 2012


3.1.2.  inter-domain

   First of all, RFC 5316 and RFC 5392 MUST be activated in the IGP-TE
   (respectively in IS-IS-TE and OSPF-TE) in order to collect TE
   information on the inter-domain links.  This give the advantage for
   the PCE to determine what could be feasible, during path computation,
   on the peering links.

   AS path and network reachability are of course obtain from the BGP
   and routing tables.  But, it is not possible to collect neither route
   diversity nor TE information on foreign domain.

   So, the main part of the inter-domain topology, like route diversity
   and TE information (i.e. transit delay, packet loss ratio, transit
   jitter ...) on a foreign domain could not be obtain easely.  Right
   now, we have identified several know methods to fulfill the TED with
   these kind of information:

   o  Use the north bound distribution of Link-State and TE Information
      using BGP [I-D.gredler-idr-ls-distribution] proposal to exchange
      TE information about the foreign domain,

   o  Use PCNtf message to convey, inside vendor attribute (but in a non
      standardize way), TE information of foreign domain between PCE,

   o  Use management system,

   As well as some potential new mechanisms that needs some
   standardization effort:

   o  A hierarchical IGP-TE that could help to convey at the AS level TE
      information on an abstract / aggregate view of the foreign AS
      topology,

   o  Extend PCEP, and in particular PCNtf message to convey such TE
      information on the foreign

3.2.  Optical layer

   To be provided latter.

3.3.  Operational information

   Most of the time operationals information are provided through the
   management system of the operator.  But some could be automatically
   discovered.  In particular, in intra-domain, PCE could discover
   automatically its peer through the deployment of RFC

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA for the moment.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


5.  Security Considerations

   Acquisition of information for the PCE TED is of course sensible from
   a security point of view, especially when acquiring information from
   others AS.  This section aims at providing best practices to prevent
   some security threat when the PCE try to acquire TED information.

5.1.  Intra-domain information

   Same security considerations must be applied to the PCE when it is
   connected to an IGP-TE protocol as the routing protocol itself.  Best
   practices observed and deployed by operators must also be taken into
   account when installing a PCE.  In fact, the PCE itself, when
   deployed as a standalone server, must be considered as a standard
   router regarding the IGP-TE.  So, disregarding OSPF or IS-IS, same
   security rules must be app lied e.g. login/passwd to protect the
   connectivity.

5.2.  Inter-domain information

   Inter-domain relation and so information exchange are subject to high
   potential hijack and so need attention from the security point of
   view.  To avoid disclosing or expose confidential information that
   two operators would exchange to fulfil the TED of their respective
   PCE, the relation SHOULD be protected by standard cryptography
   mechanism.  E.g. using IPsec tunnel is RECOMMENDED to protect the
   connectivity between PCE and TED exchange.

5.3.  Operational information

   All operational information like PCE peer addresses are generaly
   added manually to the TED and so don't need any particular protection
   nor subject to security.  But, as these based information are needed
   to let PCE connected to its peers, is could potentially contains
   sensitive parameters like login and password.  So, standard Best
   Practices are RECOMMENEDED to avoid basic security exposition.
