Internet-Draft     Hierarchical Join/Prune Attributes      February 2013


1.  Introduction

   PIM Join attributes as defined in [RFC5384] allow for specifying a
   set of attributes for each of the joined or pruned sources in a PIM
   Join/Prune message.  Attributes must be separately specified for each
   individual source in the message.  However, in some cases the same
   attributes and values need to be specified for some, or even all, the
   sources in the message.  The attributes and their values then need to
   be repeated for each of the sources where they apply.

   This document provides a hierarchical way of encoding attributes and
   their values in a Join/Prune message, so that if the same attribute
   and value is to apply for all the sources, it needs only be specified
   once in the message.  Similarly, if all the sources in a specific
   group set share a specific attribute and value, it needs only be
   specified once for the entire group set.

   This document updates [RFC5384] which defines an encoding to be used
   for Encoded-Source Addresses.  This document extends this by
   specifying the same encoding type also for Encoded-Unicast and
   Encoded-Group formats.  This document defines a new IANA registry for
   PIM encoding types which is to be used for all the fields in PIM
   messages where encoding types are used, replacing the old registry
   that is specific to Encoded-Source Addresses.  The encoding type used
   for Join attributes is however still limited to be used in Join/Prune
   messages.  Note that Join attributes, as they are referred to in
   [RFC5384], also apply to pruned sources in a Join/Prune message.
   Thus the more correct name Join/Prune attributes will be used
   throughout the rest of this document.

   This document allows Join/Prune attributes to be specified in the
   Upstream Neighbor Address field, and also in the Multicast Group
   Address field, of a Join/Prune message.  It defines how this is used
   to specify the same Join/Prune attribute and value for multiple
   sources.  This document also introduces a new Hello Option to
   indicate support for the hierarchical encoding specified.

   The message contains a single Upstream Neighbor Address, and one or
   more group sets.  Each group set contains a Group Address and two
   source lists, the Joined Sources and the Pruned Sources.  The
   Upstream Neighbor Address, the group addresses and the source
   addresses are all encoded in Encoded-Unicast format, Encoded-Group
   format and Encoded-Source format, respectively.  In this document we
   make use of this to allow Join/Prune attributes in each of these
   addresses, using the encoding in Section 4.

   For a Join/Prune message we define a hierarchy of Join/Prune
   attributes.  At the highest level, that is the least specific, we
   have attributes that apply to every source in the message.  These are
   encoded in the Upstream Neighbor Address.  At the next more specific
   level we have attributes that apply to every source in a group set.
   They are encoded in a Group Address.  And finally at the most
   specific level, we have attributes that just apply to a single
   source, encoded in the source address as defined in [RFC5384].

   The complete set of attributes that apply to a given source is
   obtained by combining the message wide attributes, the attributes of
   the group set that the source belongs to, and the source specific
   attributes.  However, if the same attribute is specified at multiple
   levels, then the one at the most specific level overrides the other
   instances of the attribute.

   Note that Join/Prune attributes are still applied to sources as
   specified in [RFC5384].  This document does not change the meaning of
   any attributes, it is simply a more compact way of encoding an
   attribute when the same attribute and value applies to multiple
   sources.

4.  PIM Address Encoding Types

   Addresses in PIM messages are specified together with an address
   family and an encoding type.  This applies to Encoded-Unicast,
   Encoded-Group and Encoded-Source addresses.  The encoding types allow
   the address to be encoded according to different schemes.  While it
   is possible to have the same encoding type value indicate different
   encodings depending on whether it is a Unicast, Group or Source
   address, it is simpler to have the same encoding type value indicate
   the same encoding independent of where it is used.  This means that
   as currently defined, 0 means a native encoding, and 1 means there
   are Join/Prune attributes, encoded according to [RFC5384].  Even if
   the encoding type space is shared between the different address types
   (Encoded-Unicast, Encoded-Group and Encoded-Source), one could have a
   specific encoding apply to a specific address type if needed.

   The current IANA PIM Encoded-Source Address Encoding Type Field
   registry should be changed into a PIM Address Encoding Type registry.

5.  Hierarchical Join/Prune Attribute Hello Option

   A PIM router indicates that it supports the mechanism specified in
   this document by including the Hierarchical Join/Prune Attribute
   Hello Option in its PIM Hello message.  Note that it also needs to
   include the Join-Attribute Hello option as specified in [RFC5384].
   The format of the Hierarchical Join/Prune Attribute Hello Option is
   defined to be:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |        OptionType = TBD       |       OptionLength = 0        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   OptionType = TBD, OptionLength = 0.  Note that there is no option
   value included.

   A PIM router MUST NOT send a Join/Prune message with Join/Prune
   attributes encoded in the Upstream Neighbor Address or any of the
   group addresses out any interface on which there is a PIM neighbor
   that has not included this option in its Hellos.  Even a router that
   is not the upstream neighbor must be able to parse the message in
   order to do Join suppression or Prune overriding.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a more compact encoding of Join/Prune
   attributes.  Use of the encoding has no impact on security.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The current PIM Encoded-Source Address Encoding Type Field registry
   should be changed into a PIM Address Encoding Type registry.  The
   only required change is the name of the registry.  The contents
   remain the same.

   A new PIM Hello Option type needs to be assigned.  The string TBD
   needs to be replaced with the permanently assigned value.
