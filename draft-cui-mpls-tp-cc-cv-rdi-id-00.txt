 Using ITU-T-based IDs for MPLS-TP Proactive Connectivity Verification
                   draft-cui-mpls-tp-cc-cv-rdi-id-00

Abstract

   This document defines how to use ICC-based Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Transport Profil(MPLS-TP) identifiers for proactive
   connectivity verification (CV) analogous to RFC 6428.  New TLVs are
   defined to support proactive CV based on identifiers following ITU-T
   conventions.

1.  Introduction

   Proactive Connectivity Verification, Continuity Check, and Remote
   Defect Indication (CV, CC and RDI) [RFC6428] is a proactive
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism for the
   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  [RFC6428], defines CV message
   which carry a Global_ID-based Source MEP-ID TLV to permit mis-
   connectivity detection to be performed by sink MEPs.  In transport
   networks however, the ITU Carrier Code (ICC) is traditionally used to
   identify a carrier/service provider.  Instead of using the Global_ID,
   which is derived from the AS number of the service provider, this
   document defines a set of Source MEP-ID TLVs based on the
   ICC_Operator_ID for sections, LSPs and PWs as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers] for use in CV.


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD","SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  ICC_Operator_ID-based Source MEP-ID TLV Definitions

   An MPLS-TP CV message [RFC6428] consists of a BFD control packet pre-
   pended by the Associated Channel Header (ACH) and appended by a
   Source MEP-ID TLV.  This section defines an ICC_Operator_ID-based
   Source MEP-ID TLV object.  It is used as a replacement for the
   Global_ID-based Source MEP-ID TLV as specified in [RFC6428].

   The format of ICC_Operator_ID-based Source MEP-ID TLV is shown below.

         Figure 1: ICC_Operator_ID-based Source MEP-ID TLV Format

   An ICC_Operator_ID-based Source MEP-ID TLV is encoded as a 2-octet
   field that specifies a type, followed by a 2-octet length field,
   followed by a value field.

   The value field is encoded by appending a 16-bit MEP index to the 15
   character long MEG_ID as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers].  Padding is used to align the
   field with a 4 octet boundary.  The length of the padding MUST be
   included in the length field.  The type will be 'X', with no
   distinction between sections, LSPs and Pseudowires [type value to be
   assigned by IANA].


4.  Security Considerations

   The security concerns expressed in the security considerations
   section of [RFC6428] apply.  No additional concerns stem from the use
   of the TLV defined in this document.


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
