		<section title="Introduction">

			<section title="Problem Statement">
				<t>
					<xref target="RFC4664"/> describes different types of
					Provider Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs).
					Some of them are widely deployed today, such as
					Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and
					Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).
					A VPWS is a VPN service that supplies a
					Layer 2 (L2) point-to-point service.
					A VPLS is an L2 service that emulates Ethernet LAN service across
					a Wide Area Network (WAN).  
				</t>

				<t>
					For some use cases described hereafter, there are
					P2MP (point-to-multipoint) type services for Layer 2 
					traffic.  However, there is no straightforward way to realize them
					based on the existing L2VPN specifications.
				</t>

				<t>
					In a VPWS, an SP can set up point-to-point connectivity
					per a pair of
					CEs but it is not possible to replicate traffic
					for point-to-multipoint
					services in the SP's network side.  A SP could build
					multiple Pseudowires (PWs) independently and have the CEs replicate traffic over
					them, but this is not only inconvenient for the customer, itâ€™s a
					waste of bandwidth resources.

				</t>

				<t>
					   In a VPLS, SPs can natively offer multipoint connectivity across
					   their backbone.  Although it is seemingly applicable for point-to-
					   multipoint service as well, there remains extra complexity for SPs to
					   filter unnecessary traffic between irrelevant sites (i.e., from a
					   receiver PE to another receiver PE) because VPLS provides
					   multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity between CEs.  Moreover, VPLS's
					   MAC-based learning/forwarding operation is unnecessary for
					   some scenarios particularly if customers only need simple
					   unidirectional point-to-multipoint service, or if they require non-
					   Ethernet Layer 2 connectivity.
				</t>

				<t>
					Consequently, there is a real need for a solution
					that natively provides point-to-multipoint service in L2VPN.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Scope of This Document">
				<t>
					  VPMS is defined as a Layer 2 service that provides point-to-
					   multipoint connectivity for a variety of Layer2 link layers across an
					   IP or MPLS-enabled PSN.  VPMS is categorized as a class of provider-
					   provisioned Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN).

				</t>

				<t>
					This document introduces a new service framework, reference
					model and functional requirements for
					VPMS by extending the existing
					framework <xref target="RFC4664"/> and requirements
					<xref target="RFC4665"/> for L2VPNs.
				</t>

				<t>
					The technical specifications are outside the scope of this
					document. There is no intent to specify
					solution-specific details.

					This document provides requirements from both the Service Provider's

		<section title="Use Cases">
			<section title="Ethernet Use Case">
				<section title="Ethernet-based multicast stream">
					<t>
						For multicast traffic delivery, there is a requirement to deliver a
						   unidirectional P2MP service in addition to the existing P2P service.
						   The demand is growing to provide private (P2MP native Ethernet) services, for various applications such as IP-
						   based delivery of TV broadcasting, content delivery networks, etc.
						   Moreover, many digital audio/video devices (e.g., MPEG-TS, HD-SDI)
						   that support Ethernet interfaces are becoming available, which will
						   make Ethernet P2MP service more common.  Also there are some
						   applications that naturally suited to static transport of VPMS.  For
						   example, MPEG-TS/IP/Ethernet in DVB-H is typically static broadcast
						   without any signaling in the upstream direction.  VPMS could be a
						   possible solution to provide these kinds of networking connectivity
						   over PSNs.
					</t>

					<t>
					   Currently VPLS <xref target="RFC4761"/><xref target="RFC4762"/>
						is able to give P2MP-type
					   replication for Ethernet traffic.  Native VPLS already supports this
					   capability via a full mesh of PWs, and an extension to optimize
					   replication is also proposed [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast] as an
					   additional feature.  However, VPLS by nature requires MAC-based
					   learning and forwarding, which might not be needed in some cases by
					   particular users.  Generally, video distribution applications use unidirectional P2MP traffic, but may not always require any added
					   complexity of MAC address management.  In addition, VPLS is a service
					   that essentially provides any-to-any connectivity between all CEs in
					   a L2VPN as it emulates a LAN service. 
					    However, if only P2MP connectivity is required, the traffic between leaf nodes
					    is not allowed. It might require extra efforts to guarantee this behavior
					    in VPLS.  And in some P2MP scenarios there no traffic from leafs to root.
					    In these cases, VPMS is a service that provides much simpler
					    operation.
					</t>
					<t>
						   Note that VPMS provides single coverage of receiver membership; that
						   is, there is no distinct differentiation for multiple multicast
						   groups in one VPN.  All traffic from a particular Attachment Circuit (AC) will
						   be forwarded toward the same remote receivers, even if the destination MAC
						   address is changed.  Basically in VPMS, destination MAC addresses are
						   not used for forwarding, which is significantly different from VPLS.
						   If MAC-based forwarding is preferred (i.e., multicast/unicast
						   differentiation by MAC address), VPLS should be chosen rather than
						   VPMS.
					</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Ethernet-based time/frequency synchronization">
					<t>
						Nowadays there exist several solutions to provide synchronization
						for time and/or frequency reference by the packet-based technology
						of Ethernet.
						For example, PTPv2 (Precision Time Protocol version 2) is a time-transfer protocol
						defined in the IEEE 1588-2008 standard.  It provides precise synchronization of
						packet-based networks (e.g., Ethernet).  
						It adopts two-way time transfer approach for synchronization.
						Time transfer protocol may be operated in multicast or unicast mode
						in both directions, and it is mapped over the Ethernet/IP/UDP protocol stack.
					</t>

					<t>
						Moreover, PTPv2 telecom profile is now discussed in ITU-T that defines a set of
						capabilities and extensions required to support telecommunication
						applications.  It aims at providing frequency distribution with higher
						level of accuracy.
						It allows unicast mode or the mix of
						unicast/multicast modes for the transmission of the PTP messages.
					</t>
					<t>
						In this aspect, VPMS might be considered as a potential packet-based
						infrastructure to deliver
						multicast messages in PTPv2 with efficient forwarding.  Note, however,
						in PTPv2 telecom profile, multicast transport may not always be supported
						in all the parts of a telecom network because multicast might sometimes
						generate additional PDV (packet delay variation) compared to unicast.
						Therefore, VPMS use case and the corresponding solution for this
						purpose will need more study in the future (e.g., PDV issue to be checked).   
					</t>
				</section>

			</section>


			<section title="ATM-based Use Case">
				<section title="ATM-based multicast stream">
					<t>
						A use case of ATM-based service in VPMS could be to offer the
						capability for 
						service providers to support IP multicast wholesale services over
						ATM
						in case the wholesale customer relies on ATM infrastructure. The 
						P2MP support alleviates the constraint in terms of replication for ATM to 
						support IP multicast services. 
					</t>
					<t>
						   Another use case of VPMS for ATM is for audio/video stream
						   applications.  Today many digital TV broadcasting networks adopt ATM-
						   based distribution systems with point-to-multipoint PVPs/PVCs.  The
						   transport network supports replicating ATM cells in transit nodes to
						   efficiently deliver programs to multiple terminals.  For migrating
						   such ATM-based networks onto IP/MPLS-based networks, VPMS is considered to be
						   a candidate solution.
					</t>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section title="TDM-based Use Case">
				<section title="TDM-based multicast stream">
					<t>
						   Today the existing VPWS already supports TDM emulation services
						   (SAToP, CESoPSN or TDMoIP).  It is a Layer 1 service, not Layer 2
						   service; however, a common architecture is being used since they are
						   all packet-based emulations over a SP's network.  VPMS is also considered to be a solution for such TDM applications that require
						   point-to-multipoint topology.
					</t>

					<t>
					   One use case is TDM-based multicast stream delivery, like video delivery.  That is, data
					   duplication is simply provided by Layer 1, without using upper
					   layer's multicast protocols.

			<t>
				A VPMS instance is defined as a service entity manageable
				in the VPMS architecture.  A single VPMS instance provides
				an isolated service reachability domain to each CE, so it
				corresponds to a so-called "VPN" as it allows communication among a specific set of
				sites.
				A single VPMS instance provides a unique
				point-to-multipoint L2VPN service.  
				In Figure 1, there are two VPMS instances shown,
				VPMS A and VPMS B.  In principle, there is no traffic exchange
				allowed between these different instances, so they are treated
				as different VPNs.
			</t>

			<t>
				In a VPMS, a single CE-PE link connection is used for transmitting frames
				for delivery to multiple remote CEs, with point-to-multipoint duplication.
				The SP's network (PE as well as P) has a role to replicate frames so that
				the sender's CE does not need to send multiple frames to individual receivers.
			</t>

			<t>
				Like VPWS, an Attachment Circuit (AC) is provided to accommodate CEs
				in a VPMS.  In a VPMS, an AC attached to a VPMS MUST be configured as
				"root" (sender) or "leaf" (receiver) not both.  
				Any AC is associated with
				the role of either sending side (Tx) or receiving side (Rx) from the
				view of the CE.  
				These will be named the root (sender) AC and leaf (receiver) AC respectively.
				Unless reverse traffic is optionally supported, a root AC does not
				transmit traffic
				back to a CE at upstream side, likewise a leaf AC does not
				receive traffic from a CE at downstream side.
				In Figure 1, AC1 and AC3 are configured as root ACs while AC2,
				AC4, AC5 and AC6 are configured as leaf ACs.  In VPMS A, CE1 could send traffic
				via AC1, and CE2 and CE5 could receive the traffic.
				
			</t>

			<t>
				A CE which is locally connected to a root AC
				is called a root (sender) CE.  Also a CE which is locally
				connected to a leaf AC is called a leaf (receiver) CE.
				However, such CEsâ€™s roles will not be 
				managed directly in VPMS because the configured ACâ€™s role
				(root or leaf)
				will automatically determine them.
			</t>

			<t>
				Similarly, a PE which locally accommodates a root AC is called a root (sender) PE.
				A PE which locally accommodates a leaf AC is called a leaf (receiver) PE.
			</t>

			<t> 
				Root AC and leaf ACs are typically located at separate PEs as shown in Figure 1,
				but it is also allowed that a single PE locally has both a root AC and one or more
				leaf ACs. 
			</t>

			<t>
				Basically there is a one-to-one mapping between an
				attachment circuit and a VPMS instance. 
				For example, all traffic from CE1 to
				PE1 (through AC1) is mapped to VPMS A (to CE2 and CE5).
			</t>

			<t> 
				In a VPMS, P2MP tree-shaped reachability is given from 
				a single root AC to several leaf ACs.  This will be named
				a "P2MP connection" in this VPMS framework.  P2MP connection is
				a logical entity between PE/ACs in a given VPMS instance
				that transfers unidirectional traffic 
				transparently from one local ingress AC to one or more remote
				egress ACs.  
			</t>

			<t>
				Similar to other L2VPN mechanisms, the VPMS architecture is based on 
				PWs which may be using
				through IP or MPLS-enabled PSN tunnels over a routed backbone.
				That is, every P2MP connection can be instantiated by 
				PW technology that supports P2MP traffic optimization
				(i.e., P2MP PW.  See section 7.2.).
				P2MP traffic optimization will
				provide the benefit of traffic replication for high bandwidth efficiency.
				That is, the sender CE has only to transmit one stream towards the PE and
				it does not have to replicate traffic.  
			</t>

			<t>
				Regarding end-to-end traffic topology between the ACs,
				a single VPMS instance (i.e., one VPN) may correspond
				to a single P2MP connection. 
				In Figure 1, VPMS A (one instance) has one P2MP connection
				(from AC1 to AC2 and AC5).  However, there
				is also a case that a single VPMS consists of two or more P2MP connections
				grouped, which is typically used for multi-source or redundancy.  The
				details are given in section 6.4 and 6.5.
			</t>

			<t>
				VPMS can support various Layer 2 protocol services
				such as Ethernet, ATM, etc.

						when a root AC and some of leaf ACs are co-located).
						If there is only one receiver in the instance, it is considered equivalent to
						unidirectional point-to-point traffic.
					</t>
				</section>


				<section title="Reverse Traffic Support">

					<t>
						There are cases where a reverse traffic flow is needed.  A root CE
						may need to receive traffic from leaf CEs.
						There are some usage scenarios for this, such as stream monitoring through a
						loopback mechanism, control channels which need feedback communication
						etc.  
						A possible way to accomplish this is to provide different
						VPMS instances for reverse traffic, i.e. a root CE is a receiver
						of another VPMS instance.  However, provisioning
						different VPNs for a particular customer would
						make its management task more complex.
						It is desired to have an alternative solution for supporting reverse traffic flow.
						This section provides additional requirements for this optional capability.
					</t>

					<t>
						Therefore, a VPMS solution 
						MAY support reverse traffic from a leaf AC to a root AC.
						Each reverse path is basically given in a P2P (unicast) manner.
						In other words, each leaf of the P2MP
						tree can individually send back traffic to the root.
						For this purpose a VPMS instance MAY have more than one 
						reverse P2P connections as network entity;
						However, such network entities MUST have a common indetifier that enables
						themselves to be managed
						together in the same VPN.  Thus any PWs used for such
						connections are expected to
						be assigned a common VPMS instance ID (i.e., VPN ID).
					</t>

					<t>
						Note, a VPMS does not assume any-to-any multipoint reachability.
						Therefore, in principle, every leaf AC
						does not need to exchange traffic directly with other leaf ACs
						even if reverse traffic is supported.
					</t>
						
						
					<t>
						Figure 3 illustrates this kind of scenario,
						where CE1 is configured as a sender 
						in VPMS A.  AC1 is a root AC, and AC2/AC3/AC4 are leaf ACs.
						P2MP connection is given for traffic in the forward direction.
						Unidirectional P2P connection is
						also provided for traffic in the reverse direction, from AC4 to AC1.    
						Other reverse P2P connections
						can be provided similarly. (from AC2 to AC1 / from AC3 to AC1).
					</t>

					<t>
						In this case, PEs need to deal with two types of traffic,
						locally-attached CE's sending (Tx) and receiving (Rx) flows.  In Figure 3, they are
						both passing through the same physical PE-CE link (AC1 and AC4 respectively). 
						But it is an implementation matter
						if Tx and Rx traffic are conveyed on the same physical link or separate links.
						It is also possible
						that a root PE multiplexes two ore more reverse traffic from different leaf ACs
						and transmits it to an upstream CE over the same local physical link.
					</t>

					<t>
						Note, in most implementations of VPWS today, every AC is always
						considered bidirectional.  In contrast, in VPMS, every AC can be chosen
						unidirectional (if it is a totally unidirectional service), or bidirectional
						(if reverse traffic is supported).

			<section title="Transparency">
				<t>
					A solution is intended to provide Layer-2 traffic transparency.
					Transparency SHOULD be supported per VPMS instance basis.
					In other words, Layer-2 traffic can be transparently transported
					from a local CE to remote CEs in a given instance.  Note, however,
					if service delimiting fields (VLAN Id in Ethernet, VPI/VCI in ATM,
					DLCI in FR etc.) are assigned and possibly can be changed by the SP, the Layer-2 traffic is not necessarily
					transparent.  It will
					depend on the SPâ€™s choice if they assign it to each AC.
					Hence, it could be that some of the leaf CEs are receiving
					traffic that has different delimiting fields than the
					traffic for the other leaf CEs.
				</t>

				<t>
					The VPMS solution SHOULD NOT require any special packet processing by the
					end users (CEs).
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Quality of Service (QoS)">
				<t>
					A customer may require that the VPMS service provide guaranteed QoS.
					In particular, for real time applications which are considered common
					in point-to-multipoint delivery, delay and loss sensitive traffic
					MUST be supported.  The solution SHOULD provide native QoS techniques
					for service class differentiation, 
					such as IEEE 802.1p CoS for Ethernet.
				</t>
				<t>
					For bandwidth committed services (e.g., ATM CBR (Constant Bit Rate)),
					a solution SHOULD guarantee end-to-end bandwidth.
					It MAY provide flow admission control mechanisms to achieve that.
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="Multi-Source Support">

					<t>
					A VPMS solution SHOULD support multiple sources in each VPN.
					That is, two or more sender CEs can exist in the same VPMS instance.
					Each sender CE SHOULD be able to be connected to physically separate root PEs,
					which will facilitate flexible topology design.
					</t>
					
					<t>
					Additionally, traffic from sender CEs MAY have a common single coverage to receiver CEs, i.e.,
					data from any sources can reach the same group of receivers.
					For example, in TV
					provisioning scenario, customers may need to receive two or more TV
					channels from different sources.  
					In figure 3, suppose there are 7 hosts, CE1 to CE7 which belong to a given VPMS instance A.
					CE1, CE2 and CE3 are common sources of this VPN, and are attached to different PEs respectively.
					Traffic from each source can reach the same group of receivers, CE4 to CE7.
					</t>

					<t>
					This kind of scenario will require multiple P2MP connections 
					in a single VPMS instance (i.e., VPN). 
					Each P2MP connection's root might be a completely different CE/AC, but
					leaf CE/ACs are overlapped.  Since this is basically the same requirement
					as dual-homed scenario, see section 6.5.1 for details.

						A solution SHOULD provide
						a protection mechanism between the redundant PEs to which a CE is dual-homed.
						This is because
						when an ingress root PE node fails whole traffic delivery will fail unless
						a backup root PE is provided, even in case of dual-homed access.
						Similarly, if an egress leaf PE node fails, traffic toward that CE is never
						received unless a backup leaf PE is provided.  
					</t>

					<t>
						In some cases, the data source is required to be highly reliable since
						it is often deployed as a centralized server that provides
						traffic to many receivers.
						Therefore, there is an additional requirement specifically
						about redundancy of root-side: each VPMS instance SHOULD be able to have
						multiple P2MP connections whose roots are 
						located at separate root ACs.  Those root ACs can be
						located at physically separate root PEs, whereas
						those trees will share common leaf ACs.
						This means that each P2MP connection has a single root AC, but
						several P2MP connections can be managed together
						inside a common VPMS (i.e, VPN).
					</t>

					<t>
						For example, in Figure 5, traffic from root AC1 and AC2
						both reach receivers CE3 and CE4 while AC1, AC2, AC3 and AC4
						all are associated with a single VPMS instance.  This topology is reliable
						since there are redundant root PE/ACs.
						At the egress side, PE3 and  PE4 select traffic from either root,
						PE1 or PE2.  In this figure, each leaf
						PE has one leaf AC only (AC3 attached to PE3, and AC4 attached to PE4).
						Therefore, PEs will need to support PW protection and restoration
						mechanism so that two redundant P2MP connections are given
						among common ACs.

				<section title="Single/Dual Traffic Support in Dual-homed Access">
					<t>
						When dual-homed access to root PEs is provided, a solution MAY allow a sender CE to 
						transmit just a single copy of the traffic to either one of the two root (ingress) PEs
						 or to
						transmit a copy of the traffic to both the PEs simultaneously.  The latter
						scenario consumes more resource of CE-PE link than
						the single traffic scenario, but it is usually applicable when a source device has only a simple
						forwarding capability without any switchover functionality.
						In such a dual traffic case, the backup root (ingress) PE SHOULD be able to
						filter the incoming unnecessary traffic while the other root PE is active if it is needed by SP.
						In either case,
						single traffic or dual traffic, the switchover mechanism between
						root (ingress) PEs will be necessary to handle
						traffic appropriately in case of failure.
					</t>
					<t>
						In the case of dual-homed access to leaf PEs, a solution MAY allow a receiver CE to
						receive a single copy of the traffic from either one of the two leaf (egress) PEs, or receive
						a copy of the traffic from both PEs simultaneously.
						The dual
						traffic approach is applicable if CE has fast switchover capability
						as a receiver by selecting either one of incoming traffic,
						but note that additional traffic resources are always
						consumed at PE-CE link of backup side.
						Specifically in the single traffic case, it might be needed to
						support switchover mechanism between egress PEs in case of failure.

			<section title="Pseudo Wire Signaling and PSN Tunneling">


				<t>
					As for data plane format and its processing procedures, VPMS solution MUST
					support encapsulation scheme that is based on the existing
					standard PW architecture <xref target="RFC3985"/>.
				</t>


				<t>
					A VPMS solution SHOULD provide an efficient replication that can
					contribute to optimizing the bandwidth usage required in a
					SP's network.  For supporting efficient replication, it is expected
					to take advantage of PW and PSN mechanisms that are capable of
					P2MP traffic.
				</t>

				<section title="Point-to-Multipoint Pseudo Wire">

				<t>
					Regarding PW mechanism, 
					<xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements"/>
					introduces P2MP PW concept and its requirements,
					showing two basic approaches of providing
					replication.  One is SS (Single Segment)-PW model that
					provides replication by PSN tunnel such as P2MP LSP (i.e., by outer
					label layer), and the other is MS (Multi Segment)-PW model
					that provides replication by multiple interconnected PWs
					(i.e., by inner label layer).  In either case, end-to-end P2MP
					topology (i.e., P2MP connection) in VPMS is common from the view of ACs.
					Requirements as a provider service specified in this document
					will be commonly applied regardless of P2MP PW's model.
				</t>

				<t>
					It is out of scope
					of this document how to extend and use PW mechanisms
					to realize P2MP connections as a solution.
					For example, it is under the scope of the solution work how to support
					forward/reverse traffic by a single PW signaling,
					coupling multiple PWs, or other ways.
				</t>
				</section>

				<section title="PSN Tunneling">
				<t>
					Today, there are several standardized PSN tunneling schemes and their
					control plane protocols that support efficient multicast data replication in MPLS, 
					such as  P2MP RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC4875"/> and MLDP <xref target="RFC6388"/>.
				</t>
				<t>					
					In general, this document does not restrict which control plane protocols
					should be mandatory.
					There is no mandatory limitation either, about a particular type of data
					replication topology in PSN tunneling
					(point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and
					multipoint-to-multipoint).
				</t>
				<t>
					In VPMS, the preferred type of PSN tunneling
					will depend on each deployment scenario. 
					(e.g., which control plane protocol is available in the core and how much
					of the network resources that operators will want to optimize).  The detailed
					mechanism needs to be specified by solution work.
				</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Static Solution">
				<t>
					VPMS solution MAY support static provisioning for PWs and/or PSN tunneling.
					Due to some operational reasons, there is a scenario where
					control plane protocol is not used between PSN nodes.
					In this case, operators will need to have
					a different method to set up PWs and/or PSN tunnels
					(e.g., by manual configuration or other
					outband interfaces).  
				</t>
				</section>

			</section>




			<section title="Auto-discovery">
				<t>
					A solution SHOULD support auto-discovery methods that dynamically
					allow VPMS related information to be discovered by the PEs to minimize the
					amount of configuration the SP must perform.
				</t>
				<t>
					All of the requirements on discovery described in 
					Section 7.3 of <xref target="RFC4665"/>
					SHOULD be satisfied in VPMS as well.
				</t>

				<t>
					Auto-discovery will help operators' initial configuration of
					adding a new VPN (i.e., VPMS instance),
					adding/deleting new sender/receiver, and so on.
				</t>

				<t>
					The candidate information treated in auto-discovery will be as follows:
				</t>
					<t>
						<list style='hanging'>
							<t hangText='-'>
							Information to indentify the location of each PE, e.g., PE router ID / IP address
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
							Information to identify the VPMS instance, that is, to identify a VPN 
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
							Information to identify the type of ACs (root AC or leaf AC)
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
							Information to identify the P2MP connection that binds ACs 
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
							Information to show if reverse traffic support is optionally desired 
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
							SP-related information (AS number, etc. for an inter-provider case)
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>

				<t>
				   Following is an example scenario about adding a new leaf PE:  suppose there are three PEs in an existing VPMS, PE1, PE2, PE3.  PE1 is a root PE and has a AC1.  PE2 and PE3 are leaf PEs and have AC2 and AC3.  every PE has the
				   association among the information described above.  Now a new PE4
				   having an AC4 is provisioned in the existing VPMS instance and this AC
				   is configured as leaf.  This information will be automatically
				   discovered by the other existing remote PEs (i.e., ingress and egress
				   PEs in the same VPMS instance).  Once the ingress PE1 discovers this
				   new PE/AC, it can automatically add AC4 as the new leaf of P2MP
				   connection topology according to P2MP PW signaling mechanism.
				   The ingress PE1 will graft a new leaf (PE4) to the already existing P2MP connection
				   which is now created from AC1 to AC2/AC3/AC4.  This operation does not
				   require any new configuration at the existing PEs.
				</t>

				<t>
				   Another example is about adding a new root PE: suppose there are one root
				PE (PE1/AC1) and three leaf PEs (PE2/AC2, PE3/AC3 and PE4/AC4). 
				There is an existing P2MP connection from AC1 to AC2/AC3/AC4.
				Now the operator adds a new root PE/AC (PE5/AC5) for some reasons (e.g., multiple source sites, dual-homed access, root PE redundancy etc.).  Then, auto-discovery mechanism advertises
				this information to all other members PE1/PE2/PE3/PE4, and a new P2MP connection from
				AC5 to AC2/AC3/AC4 is created by PW signaling.
				</t>

				<t>
				Note that VPMS instance is created when one root AC and at least one
				leaf AC are added.  In principle VPMS requires such minimum
				provisioning.  Hence in dual-homing case of sender, only backup root
				PE can be dynamically added/deleted to/from VPMS without destroying
				the VPN.
				</t>

			</section>




		
			<section title="Activation and Deactivation">
				<t>
					A solution SHOULD provide a way to 
					activate/deactivate the administrative status of each AC.
					After initial provisioning, 
					an SP might change connectivity configuration 
					between particular CEs inside a single VPMS instance
					for operational reasons.  This feature will be beneficial to
					help such a scenario.
				</t>
				<t>
					For example, in Figure 6,
					AC1, AC3, AC4 and AC5 are initially provisioned 
					for VPMS A.  AC2 is not provisioned for any VPMSes.  In VPMS A, CE1 is
					a sender and CE3, CE4 and CE5 are receivers.
					Traffic will usually flow from CE1 to all
					receivers, CE3, CE4 and CE5.  However, for maintenance operation,
					application's request (e.g., stream program has changed) or some other reasons,
					AC4 needs to
					be set as administratively deactivated.  Then it becomes necessary to
					turn off traffic from PE4 to CE4.  This operation
					must be appropriately distinguished from failure cases.
				</t>

				<t>
					When deactivating a particular site, backbone PSN/PW resources (e.g.,
					admission control of PSN tunnel) MAY be released for that particular
					direction in order to provide that bandwidth to other services.  In
					Figure 6, AC3 is now administratively activated and receiving traffic.
					However, if AC3 comes to be administratively deactivated, and if
					RSVP-TE (including P2P and/or P2MP) is used for backbone PSN, then TE
					reserved resources from PE1 to PE3 may be released.
				</t>

				<t>
					In addition, a solution SHOULD allow single-sided activation
					operation at a root (ingress) PE.  In some scenarios, operators prefer
					centralized operation.  This is often considered natural for one-way
					digital audio/video distribution applications: SPs often want to
					complete their service delivery by a single operation at one source
					PE, not by multiple operations at many leaf (egress) PEs.  Figure 6
					illustrates this scenario, where a SP only has to do single-sided
					operation at PE1 (source) to administratively activate/deactivate
					various connections from AC1 to AC3, AC4 and/or AC5.  It is not
					needed to perform operations on PE3 and PE4 directly.

					<section title="Fault Detection">
						<t>
							A solution MUST provide tools that detect reachability failure and traffic looping of data transport in a VPMS instance.  If multiple root ACs are supported (i.e., multiple P2MP connections are grouped together into a single VPMS instance), such tools MUST be able to perform distinguishing each P2MP connection. 
						</t>
					</section>
					<section title="Fault Notification">
						<t>
							A solution MUST provide fault notification and trouble tracking mechanisms. (e.g.  SNMP-trap and syslog that notify fault to remote NMS.)
						</t>
						<t>
							In VPMS one point of failure at upstream often affects a number of downstream PEs and ACs that might raise a notification message.  Hence notification messages MAY be summarized or compressed for operators' ease of management.
						</t>
						<t>
							In case of receiver-side failure (leaf PE or its AC), this fault status SHOULD be able to be monitored at root PE.  This will help an operator to monitor each leaf PE/AC in a centralized manner; that is, a root PE can collect leaf-side information.  How this status is transferred depends on a solution.
						</t>
						<t>
							In contrast, in case of sender-side failure (root PE or its AC), this fault status SHOULD also be able to be monitored at leaf PEs. This will help an operator to troubleshoot at leaf PEs (i.e., distinguish local ACâ€™s failure from remote root ACâ€™s failure easily). 
						</t>
						<t>
							In any case of failure at SPâ€™s network, fault information MAY be notified to the customer.  Specifically, such fault MAY trigger generating customer OAM message toward CEs (e.g., AIS) and/or shutting down leaf ACs.
						</t>

				<section title="Testing">
					<t>
						A solution MUST provide a mechanism for testing each data connectivity and verifying the associated information in a VPMS instance.  The connectivity is between a root and all leaf ACs (i.e., each P2MP connection can be tested).
					</t>
					<t>
						Operators will run testing before and after service activation.  Testing mechanism SHOULD support end-to-end testing of the data path used by customer's data.  End-to-end testing will have CE-to-CE path test and PE-to-PE path test.  A solution MUST support PE-to-PE path test and MAY support CE-to-CE path test.  In either case the minimum data path unit for each VPMS is unidirectional, hence if loopback testing is supported, additional consideration about reverse-path might also be needed (see section 6.1.2). 
					</t>

 					<t>
						If there are multiple P2MP connections for redundancy (active/backup tree) in  a common VPMS (like in Figure 4),
						testing mechanism MUST be able to check the connectivity over not only working P2MP connection but also protecting connection(s).  This testing MUST be able to be performed from 
						a root PE.  It MAY also be able to be performed from a sender CE.

							<t hangText='-'>
								Traffic statistics (total traffic forwarded, incoming, outgoing, dropped, etc., by period of time)

			<section title="Security">
				<t>
Section 7.6. of [RFC4665] describes common Layer-2 VPN security requirements from service provider aspect, which also applies to VPMS.   (For example, an SP network MUST be protected against malformed or maliciously constructed customer traffic, etc.)
				</t>

				<t>
This subsection adds VPMSâ€“specific consideration and requirements. 
				</t>
				<t>
In VPMS, all traffic is transported with multicast duplication in terms of end-to-end perspective, regardless of customerâ€™s individual protocol.  A PE never processes CEâ€™s multicast control protocol (e.g., PIM, IGMP, MLD as Layer-3).  Hence, in PE and P, basically the security threat from malicious customerâ€™s C-plane protocol is small.
				</t>
				<t>
In VPMS, there is security threat from malicious customersâ€™ D-plane traffic.  A PE might receive a high volume of data from a CE.  If there is no safeguard on PE, it will cause excessive replication in the SP network.  Therefore, a VPMS solution SHOULD support traffic policing to limit the unwanted data traffic.  Such a policing mechanism MUST be configurable per VPN basis, not the total of various VPNs to isolate malicious customer's traffic from others.  
				</t>
			</section>

		</section>




		<section title="Security Considerations">
				<t>
  The security requirements common to customers and service providers are raised in Section 5.5. of [RFC4665], which are fundamental for all Layer-2 VPN services.  VPMS is a variant of Layer-2 VPN, and that statement also applies to VPMS.
				</t>

				<t>
  Moreover, in this document, security requirements from the view of customers are shown in Section 6.5.  Security requirements from the view of providers are shown in Section 7.8.  They explain security considerations that are specific to VPMS.
