                draft-yevstifeyev-foobar-to-historic-00

Abstract

   RFC 1639 and its predecessor - RFC 1545 - specified the way to denote
   network addresses in the format other than that used with IPv4 when
   establishing File Transfer Protocol (FTP) data connection.  Because
   of some reasons, described in this document, these commands are now
   deprecated and their use is discouraged; in order to reflect this it
   moves RFC 1545 and RFC 1639 to Historic status and obsoletes these
   two RFCs.

1. Introduction and Background

   RFC 1639 [RFC1639] and its predecessor - RFC 1545 [RFC1545] -
   specified the way to denote network addresses in the format other
   than that used with IPv4 [RFC0791] when establishing File Transfer
   Protocol (FTP) [RFC0959] data connection.  This facility was provided
   by LPRT and LPSV commands, which stand for "long port" and "long
   passive" and were designed to provide the same functions as standard
   FTP PORT and PASV commands, but allowed specifying the "address
   family" parameter in addition to the address itself.   This technique
   was named FTP Operation Over Big Address Records, abbreviated FOOBAR.

   Because of some reasons, described in Section 2, FOOBAR commands are
   now deprecated; in order to reflect it this memo moves RFC 1545 and
   RFC 1639 to Historic status.  It also obsoletes these two RFCs.

2. FOOBAR is Obsolete

   This section explains why FOOBAR is currently obsolete.

   With publication of RFC 2428 [RFC2428], it became clear that EPRT and
   EPSV commands, which it defines, can fully cover the functionality of
   the aforementioned LPRT and LPSV commands.  The main difference
   between these two approaches is that LPRT and LPSV used a special
   FOOBAR-specific "address family" parameter for identifying the used
   address format (whereas the first 16 FOOBAR "address family"
   identifiers were the reused IP version numbers).   EPRT and EPSV, on
   the other hand, make use of common address family identifier, as
   primarily employed by RIPv2 [RFC2453].

   Even though both techniques were designed for the same reason, EPRT
   and EPSV are now considered to be a preferred way of establishing FTP
   data connection using non-IPv4 addresses; use of LPRT and LPSV is
   strongly discouraged in favor of EPRT and EPSV.  Moreover, RFC 1639
   is an Experimental RFC while RFC 2428 is a Standards Track one.

   Upon creation of IANA registry for FTP commands per RFC 5797
   [RFC5797], LPRT and LPSV commands were already designated as
   historical.  Section 2.5 of RFC 5797 says:

     The following commands were specified as part of the "FOOBAR" IPng
     effort in RFC 1545 [RFC1545] and, later, RFC 1639 [RFC1639] and are

     now obsolete.  They are listed in the registry with the immutable
     pseudo FEAT code "hist".

        LPRT, LPSV

   However, either RFC 2428 and RFC 5797 failed to reclassify RFC 1639
   and RFC 1545 as Historic, which this document does.

3. Action

   According to RFC 2026 [RFC2026] and [HISTORIC], RFC 1545 and RFC 1639
   are reclassified as Historic by this document.

4. Security Considerations

   This document is of administrative nature only and therefore there
   are no security relations related to it.

5. IANA Considerations

   LPRT and LPSV commands are already listed in FTP Commands and
   Extensions registry [RFC5797] as 'historical'.  The only action this
   document requests IANA to perform is to list this RFC as an
   additional reference for these two commands.
