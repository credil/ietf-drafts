Internet-Draft          NVO3 Use Case                       August 2012


1. Introduction

   Compute Virtualization has dramatically and quickly changed IT
   industry in terms of efficiency, cost, and the speed in providing a
   new applications and/or services. However, in a Data Center, the
   configuration on virtual machines is often tied to the physical
   network configuration, which forces multi-tenant applications to
   deal with physical network limitations in a virtual environment.
   This limitation hinders the flexibility in constructing cloud
   applications and virtual Data Centers.

   IETF NVO3 WG works on a solution for DC network virtualization
   overlays to relax this limitation. The solution will decouple the
   virtual machines (VM) and DC physical networks and make both VMs and
   its networking exist in a virtual environment. This will enable to
   build an IT application in a true virtual environment and isolate
   the traffic among different applications. The solution will allow
   constructing many tenant virtual networks on a common network
   infrastructure and provides: 1) traffic isolation among one another;
   2) independent address space in each virtual network and address
   isolation from the infrastructure's; 3) VM placement and move from
   one server to another without any physical network limitation. These
   characteristics will help speed up the configuration of multi-tenant
   cloud applications and virtual Data Center, and bring the potentials
   for a new DC application.

   Although NVO3 enables a true virtual environment where VMs and net
   service appliances communicate, NVO3 solution has to address how to
   communicate between a virtual network and physical network. This is
   because 1) many traditional DCs already exist and will not disappear
   any time soon; 2) a lot of DC applications serve to Internet and/or
   cooperation users; 3) some applications like Big Data analytics
   which are CPU bound may not want to the virtualization capability.

   This document provides three sets of generalized use cases for
   Network Virtualization Overlays. These use cases are intended to
   help validate the NVO3 framework and requirements as along with the
   development of the solutions.

   One set of use cases is to connect many tenant end systems in one
   Data Center and form one L2 or L3 communication domain. A virtual
   network segregates its traffic from others and allows the VMs in the
   network moving from one server to another. The case may be used for
   DC internal applications that constitute the DC East-West traffic.

Internet-Draft          NVO3 Use Case                       August 2012

   The second set of use cases is for a DC provider to offer a secure
   DC service to an enterprise customer and/or Internet users. In these
   cases, the enterprise customer may use a traditional VPN provided by
   a carrier or IPsec tunnel over Internet connecting to an overlay
   virtual network offered by a Data Center provider. This is mainly
   constitutes DC North-South traffic.

   The third set of use cases is to enable the designs of various DC
   applications using the net service appliance, virtual compute,
   storage, and networking. In this case, NVO3 provides the virtual
   networking functions for the applications.

   The document uses the architecture reference model and terminologies
   defined in [NVO3FRWK] to describe the use cases.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminologies defined in [NVO3FRWK],
   [RFC4364]. Some additional terms used in the document are listed
   here.

   VNIF: Internal Virtual Network Interconnection Interface

   L2 VNI: L2 Virtual Network Instance

   L3 VNI: L3 Virtual Network Instance

   CPE: Customer Premise Equipment

   DNS: Domain Name Service

   DMZ: DeMilitarized Zone

   NAT: Network Address Translation

   POD: Performance Optimized Data Center

3. Virtual Network in One Data Center

   A tenant virtual network may exist in one DC. The network
   interconnects many tenant end systems that communicate as a closed
   user group.

   Figure 1 depicts this case by using the framework model. [NVO3FRWK]
   NVE1 and NVE2 are two network virtual edges and each may exist on a

   server or ToR. Each NVE may be the members of multiple virtual
   networks that may have different topologies and run at L2 or L3
   individually. In this illustration, three virtual networks with VN
   context Ta, Tn, and Tm are shown. The VNIa terminates on both NVE1
   and NVE2; The VNIn terminates on NVE1 and the VNIm at NVE2 only.
   Each NVE has one overlay module to perform frame
   encapsulation/decapsulation and tunneling initiation/termination. In
   this scenario, a tunnel between NVE1 and NVE2 is necessary for the
   virtual network Ta. Note that it is possible that one TES
   participates in more than one virtual network via one VAP for each;
   further if individual virtual networks use different address spaces,
   the TES participating in them will be configured with multiple
   addresses as well. A TES as a gateway is an example.

  A VNI on an NVE is a forwarding table that caches and/or maintains
  the mapping of an end system and its attached NVE. The table entry
  may be updated by the control plane or data plane or the combination
  of both.  A TES associates to one VNI via a VAP. One tenant virtual
  network may terminate on many NVEs and interconnect several
  thousands of TESs, the capability of supporting a lot of TESs per
  tenant instance and TES mobility is critical for NVO3 solution no
  matter where an NVE resides.

Internet-Draft          NVO3 Use Case                       August 2012

   Individual virtual networks may use its own address space and the
   space is isolated from DC infrastructure. This eliminates the route
   changes in the DC underlying network when VMs move. Note that the
   NVO3 solutions still have to address VM move in the overlay network,
   i.e. the TES/NVE association change when a VM moves.

   It is worth mentioning two scenarios regarding to the NVE location.
   At first an NVE resides on a server, a server manager system such as
   vCenter [VMWARE] is responsible to create NVE/VNs and VMs, and also
   responsible to assign a VM to a VN that has unique identification,
   the server software just makes it works properly and securely.
   Second an NVE resides on physical switch such as ToR, when a server
   manger system creates a VM and add it to a VN, the server will send
   a notification of TES participating in a VN to the local NVE.
   [ESYS][VDP] Note that if non-virtualized server is used, local
   configuration on NVE is necessary to attach the TES (server) to a VN.
   In both cases, when a local NVE notices the new attached TES in a VN,
   it will announce the TES to remote NVEs or to a mapping server via a
   control plane protocol. In the case of using mapping server, the
   remote NVEs can query the server for any TES location and cache it
   in the VNI.

   If a tenant virtual network spans across multiple DC sites, one
   design is to allow the corresponding NVO3 instance seamlessly span
   across those sites without DC gateway routers' termination (see
   section 4.3). In this case, the tunnel between a pair of NVEs may in
   turn be tunneled over other intermediate tunnels over the Internet
   or other WANs, or the intra DC and inter DC tunnels are stitched
   together to form an end-to-end tunnel between two NVEs.

4. Interconnection between DC Virtual Network and External Users

   In this scenario, the customers (an enterprise or individuals)
   utilize the DC provider's compute and storage resources to run its
   applications, and the DC provider allows the customer to access his
   hosted end systems through a Carrier WAN or Internet. Three cases
   are described here.

4.1. DC Virtual Network Access via Internet

   A user or an enterprise customer may want to connect to a DC virtual
   network via Internet but securely. Figure 2 illustrates this case.
   An L3 virtual network is configured on NVE1 and NVE2 and two NVEs
   are connected via an L3 tunnel in the Data Center. A set of tenant
   end systems attach to NVE1. The NVE2 connects to one (may be more)
   TES that runs the VN gateway and NAT applications (known as net
   service appliance). A user or customer can access the VN via

   Internet by using IPsec tunnel.[RFC4301]  The encrypted tunnel is
   established between the VN GW and the user machine or CPE at
   enterprise location. The VN GW provides authentication scheme and
   encryption. Note that VN GW function may be performed by a net
   service appliance or on a DC GW.

4.2. One Virtual Network Method for DC Connectivity

   If both the DC Provider and Carrier use the same encapsulation and
   tunneling technology, it is possible to configure one overlay
   virtual network instance across DC networks and Carrier networks.
   For example, if both DC provider and Carrier use existing BGP/MPLS
   VPN solutions [RFC4364] and GRE Tunnel, the NVE in DC and the PE in
   WAN can be members of one VN instance. Figure 3 illustrates this
   scenario. The left side of the figure presents an NVE (NVE1) in DC
   Provider site connecting to tenant end-systems; the right side shows
   Provider Edge (PE1) in a WAN network connecting to Customer Edge (CE)
   at an Enterprise site. The CE is often a network site and contains
   routers and/or switches and terminal systems.

   In this case, an L3 VNI and L3VPN instance are configured on NVE1
   and PE1, respectively. If the MPLS label is used as VN context/VPN

   identifier and GRE tunnel (IPsec)[RFC4023] is established between
   NVE1 and PE1, the configuration will provide the L3 connectivity
   between a TES and CE. The MPLS label for the L3 VNI identifier (Ta)
   on NVE1 can be different from the MPLS label for the L3VPN
   identifier (VPNID) on PE1 since MPLS labels are locally significant.
   Although the figure shows Overlay Module on NVE1 and Encap/Decap
   (Encapsulation/Decapsulation) on PE1, both use the same
   encapsulation semantics; it is just a matter of different
   terminologies in NVO3 framework [NVO3FRWK] and L3VPN [RFC4364].

   The DC and WAN networks may belong to different ASs. Control plane
   or management plane protocols can facilitate the VN configuration.
   Routing and forwarding between NVE1 and TES are mentioned in section
   3; Routing and forwarding between NVE1 and PE1 and between PE1 and
   CE in Figure 3 are as specified in RFC4364 [RFC4364]. Note that the
   draft just uses BGP/MPLS L3VPN as an example for this case, not lead
   to this specific solution. Trade-off of this solution is described
   in [NVO3PRBM].

4.3. NVO3 and VPN Interconnection at DC Gateway

   The DC Provider and Carrier may build a tenant VN and VPN for an
   enterprise customer independently and interconnect the two together
   at the DC GW. Figure 4 depicts this case. The GW supports both NVE
   and PE capability. Here an L3 VN instance is built between NVE1 on a
   server and the NVE2 on DC GW and an L3VPN instance is configured on
   DC GW and PE1, respectively. The NVE2 on DC GW performs L3 VNI
   functions, NVO3 encapsulation, and tunneling toward the DC; it also
   performs L3VPN functions toward the WAN. Both L3 tunnel and LSP
   Tunnel terminate at the DC GW. The packets are processed at the L3
   VNI on DC GW. Operators may choose use of one routing table for both
   instances as shown in the figure or choose one for each.

   This implementation is more complex than the one in section 4.2.
   However it provides DC network and WAN network demarcation clearly
   and allows each network use of different VN implementations, which
   is necessary in many situations. Note that the nvo3 solution can be
   simpler than traditional VPNs. Furthermore, two VNs may use
   different address spaces and let DC GW to perform the address
   translation.

   The alternative of this case is to physically split the gateway
   function on to DC GW and WAN PE devices. In this case, the tenant
   instance is terminated on the DC GW and the L3VPN instance
   terminates at a PE in the WAN. An Ethernet interface is used to
   physically connect to the DC GW and PE devices and an Ethernet VLAN
   is configured on both devices for interconnecting two instances,
   which will be the same as VRF-Lite [VRF-LITE].

   If an enterprise only has a few locations, it may use P2P VPWS
   [RFC4664] or L2TP [RFC5641].

   Such interconnection may also apply to across multiple DC sites.
   During the migration process, it is possible that some portion of a
   DC site may be able to support NVE and the other may not. Such
   gateway function may be used to interconnect a tenant instance and a
   regular underlying VPN in DC to provide the connectivity to the VMs
   belonging to the same tenant.

5. DC Applications Using NVO3

   NVO3 brings DC operators the flexibility to design different
   applications in a virtual environment without worry about physical
   network configuration in the Data Center. DC operators may build
   several virtual networks and interconnect them directly to form a

   tenant virtual network; or may allocate some VMs to run tenant
   applications and some to run net service applications such as
   Firewall, DNS for the tenant. Several use cases are given in this
   section.

5.1. Supporting Multi Technologies in a Data Center

   Most likely servers deployed in a large data center are rolled in at
   different times and may have different capacities/features. Some
   servers may be virtualized, some may not; some may be equipped with
   virtual switches, some may not. For the ones equipped with
   hypervisor based virtual switches, some may support VxLAN [VXLAN]
   encapsulation, some may support NvGRE encapsulation [NVGRE], and
   some may not support any types of encapsulation.

   To enable the communications among these VMs or servers in a virtual
   environment, it is necessary to have an entity, either on Gateway or
   standalone one, to map the services and identifiers and change the
   packet encapsulation semantics among the Virtual Networks with
   different encapsulations.

5.2. Tenant Virtual Network with Bridging/Routing

   A tenant virtual network may span across multiple Data Centers. DC
   operator may want to use L2VN within a DC and L3VN outside DCs for a
   tenant. This is very similar to today's DC physical network
   configuration. L2 bridging has the simplicity and endpoint awareness
   while L3 routing has advantages in aggregation and scalability. For
   this configuration, the virtual gateway function is necessary to
   interconnect L2VN and L3VN in each DC. Figure 5 illustrates this
   configuration.

   Figure 5 depicts two DC sites. The site A constructs an L2VN that
   terminates on NVE1, NVE2, and GW1. An L3VN is configured between the
   GW1 at site A and the GW2 at site Z. An internal Virtual Network
   Interconnection Interface (VNIF) connects to L2VNI and L3VNI on GW1.
   Thus the GW1 is the members of the L2VN and L3VN. The L2VNI is the
   MAC/NVE mapping table and the L3VNI is IP prefix/NVE mapping table.
   Note that a VNI also has the mapping of TES and VAP at the local NVE.
   The site Z has the similar configuration. A packet coming to the GW1
   from L2VN will be descapulated and converted into an IP packet and
   then encapsulated and sent to the site Z. The Gateway uses ARP
   protocol to obtain MAC/IP mapping. Note that both the L2VN and L3VN
   in the figure are carried by the tunnels supported by the underlying
   networks which are not shown in the figure.

5.3. Virtual Data Center

   Enterprise DC's today may often use several routers, switches, and
   service devices to construct its internal network, DMZ, and external
   network access. A DC Provider may offer a virtual DC to an
   enterprise customer to run enterprise applications such as
   website/emails. Instead of using many hardware devices, with the
   overlay and virtualization technology of NVO3, DC operators can
   build them on top of a common network infrastructure for many
   customers and run service applications per customer basis. The
   service applications may include firewall, gateway, DNS, load
   balancer, NAT, etc.

   Figure 6 below illustrates this scenario. For the simple
   illustration, it only shows the L3VN or L2VN as virtual and overlay
   routers or switches. In this case, DC operators construct several L2
   VNs (L2VNx, L2VNy, L2VNz in figure 6) to group the end tenant
   systems together per application basis, create an L3VNa for the
   internal routing. A server or VM runs firewall/gateway applications
   and connects to the L3VNa and Internet. A VPN tunnel is also built
   between the gateway and enterprise router. The design runs

   Enterprise Web/Mail/VoIP applications at the provider DC site; lets
   the users at Enterprise site to access the applications via the VPN
   tunnel and Internet via a gateway at the Enterprise site; let
   Internet users access the applications via the gateway in the
   provider DC. The enterprise operators can also use the VPN tunnel or
   IPsec over Internet to access the vDC for the management purpose.
   The firewall/gateway provides application-level and packet-level
   gateway function and/or NAT function.

   The Enterprise customer decides which applications are accessed by
   intranet only and which by both intranet and extranet; DC operators
   then design and configure the proper security policy and gateway
   function. DC operators may further set different QoS levels for the
   different applications for a customer.

   This application requires the NVO3 solution to provide the DC
   operator an easy way to create NVEs and VNIs for any design and to
   quickly assign TESs to a VNI, and easily configure policies on an
   NVE.

                Figure 6 Virtual Data Center by Using NVO3

6. OAM Considerations

   NVO3 brings the ability for a DC provider to segregate tenant
   traffic. A DC provider needs to manage and maintain NVO3 instances.
   Similarly, the tenant needs to be informed about tunnel failures
   impacting tenant applications.

   Various OAM and SOAM tools and procedures are defined in [IEEE
   802.1ag, ITU-T Y.1731, RFC4378, RFC5880, ITU-T Y.1564] for L2 and L3
   networks, and for user, including continuity check, loopback, link
   trace, testing, alarms such as AIS/RDI, and on-demand and periodic
   measurements. These procedures may apply to tenant overlay networks
   and tenants not only for proactive maintenance, but also to ensure
   support of Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

   As the tunnel traverses different networks, OAM messages need to be
   translated at the edge of each network to ensure end-to-end OAM.

   It is important that failures at lower layers which do not affect
   NVo3 instance are to be suppressed.

7. Summary

   The document describes some basic potential use cases of NVO3. The
   combination of these cases should give operators flexibility and
   power to design more sophisticated cases for various purposes.

   The main differences between other overlay network technologies and
   NVO3 is that the client edges of the NVO3 network are individual and
   virtualized hosts,not network sites or LANs. NVO3 enables these
   virtual hosts communicating in a true virtual environment without
   considering physical network configuration.

   NVO3 allows individual tenant virtual networks to use their own
   address space and isolates the space from the network infrastructure.
   The approach not only segregates the traffic from multi tenants on a
   common infrastructure but also makes VM placement and move easier.

   DC applications are about providing virtual processing/storage,
   applications, and networking in a secured and virtualized manner, in
   which the NV03 is just a portion of an application. NVO3 decouples
   the applications and DC network infrastructure configuration.

Internet-Draft          NVO3 Use Case                       August 2012

   NVO3's underlying network provides the tunneling between NVEs so
   that two NVEs appear as one hop to each other. Many tunneling
   technologies can serve this function. The tunneling may in turn be
   tunneled over other intermediate tunnels over the Internet or other
   WANs.  It is also possible that intra DC and inter DC tunnels are
   stitched together to form an end-to-end tunnel between two NVEs.

   A DC virtual network may be accessed via an external network in a
   secure way. Many existing technologies can achieve this.

   The key requirements for NVO3 are 1) traffic segregation; 2)
   supporting a large scale number of virtual networks in a common
   infrastructure; 3) supporting highly distributed virtual network
   with sparse memberships 3) VM mobility 4) auto or easy to construct
   a NVE and its associated TES; 5) Security 6) NVO3 Management
   [NVO3PRBM].

8. Security Considerations

   Security is a concern. DC operators need to provide a tenant a
   secured virtual network, which means the tenant traffic isolated
   from other tenant's and non-tenant VMs not placed into the tenant
   virtual network; they also need to prevent DC underlying network
   from any tenant application attacking through the tenant virtual
   network or one tenant application attacking another tenant
   application via DC networks. For example, a tenant application
   attempts to generate a large volume of traffic to overload DC
   underlying network. The NVO3 solution has to address these issues.

9. IANA Considerations
