Internet-Draft          Lawful Intercept Support              March 2013


1.  Introduction

   Lawful Intercept stands for legally authorized capture & delivery of
   subscriber communications data by a communications provider to a law
   enforcement agency (LEA).  The communications data, which the LEA
   will intercept as part of the target subscriber surveillance, is
   classified into two types, Communication Content (CC) and Intercept
   Related Information (IRI).  CC is the bearer data exchanged to and
   from the subscriber.  IRI provides the relevant context information
   for the CC.  IRI is a loosely defined term and the scope varies for
   different end user applications.

   In most of the countries, there are legal obligations for Service
   Providers to facilitate the intercept of any subscriber's
   communication, if requested by law enforcement agencies.
   Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), the United
   States wiretapping law passed in 1994 is an example for such legal
   mandates.

   The objective of this document is to describe generic LI architecture
   models and implementation considerations for Service Provider Wi-Fi
   deployments.In this document two type of SP Wi-Fi deployment
   scenarios are covered from the LI implementation perspective.

   1.  SP Wi-Fi Deployment Models with Inter-Operator Roaming (Model-1)

   2.  SP Wi-Fi Deployment Models without Inter-Operator Roaming
       (Model-2)


2.  Terminology

   All the Lawful Intercept related terms used in this document are to
   be interpreted as defined in [RFC3924].  Additionally, this document
   uses the following terms:

   Lawful Intercept (LI)

      Lawful Intercept stands for legally authorized capture & delivery
      of a subscriber's communications data by a communications provider
      to a law enforcement agency.

   Law Enforcement Agency (LEA)

      Various government agencies at National, Regional and Local levels
      which are responsible for the enforcement of laws.

Internet-Draft          Lawful Intercept Support              March 2013


   Intercept Related Information (IRI)

      Information related to the subscriber data traffic of interest.
      IRI is a loosely defined term and the scope varies for different
      end user applications.

   Communications Content (CC)

      CC refers to the subscriber data traffic of interest.

   Intercept Access Point (IAP)

      An IAP is a device within the network that is used for
      intercepting lawfully authorized intercept information.  There are
      two types of IAPs, IAPs those provide communication content (CC
      IAP) & IAPs those provide intercept related information (IRI IAP).

   Mediation Device (MD)

      Mediation Devices is the entity which provisions and activates LI
      on the relevant network elements.  The Service Provider LI Admin
      Function (AF) is used to configure the Mediation Device based up
      on the Intercept request received from the LEA.

   Delivery Function (DF)

      Delivery function is responsible for the collection of IRI and CC
      data from the relevant IAPs, reformat those to match the
      appropriateLEA Handover Interface Standards and forward the same
      to LEA.  In some deployment models, MD and DF may be collocated on
      the same system.

   Collection Function (CF)

      The entity on the LEA side which receives the IRI and CC data over
      standard Handover Interfaces.

   Wireless Access Gateway (WAG)

      A network element in a Service Provider Wi-Fi deployment which is
      used to implement and enforce per subscriber policies.  WAG
      typically interacts with external policy provisioning and
      authorization systems to implement per subscriber policies and
      regulate the service access for the subscribers.

Internet-Draft          Lawful Intercept Support              March 2013


   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)

      A network based mobility management protocol standardized by IETF
      and is specified in RFC 5213

   Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)

      A tunneling protocol that can encapsulate a wide variety of
      Network Layer Protocols inside virtual point-to-point links over
      an Internet Protocol Internetwork.

   CAPWAP

      CAPWAP stands for Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access
      Points.  The protocol specification is described in RFC 5415 and
      an IEEE 802.11 binding is provided in RFC 5416.

   GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP)

      A group of IP based communications protocols used to carry general
      packet radio service (GPRS) with in GSM, UMTS and LTE networks.

   Home Gateway

      In an inter-operator roaming scenario, Home Gateway is the network
      layer topological anchor point for a roaming partner's subscriber.
      Example of a Home Gateway is an LMA in a PMIPv6 based deployment.


3.  Generic SP Wi-Fi Deployment Model with Inter-Operator Roaming
    (Model-1)

   Illustrated in Figure 1 below is a generic SP Wi-Fi deployment model
   with Inter-Operator Roaming.  In this model, Wi-Fi operator has
   roaming relationship with two partners A and B. Roaming architectures
   typically use standard protocols such as PMIPv6 or GTP for signaling
   and data offload between the home operator and the access provider.

     Figure 1: Generic SP Wi-Fi Deployment with Inter-Operator Roaming

   In SP Wi-FI Deployments with Inter-Operator roaming scenarios, LI
   will have to account for intercept corresponding to two types of
   subscribers.

   o  Native subscribers accessing the Wi-Fi Operator's Network

   o  Subscribers from Roaming Partners accessing the Wi-Fi Operator's
      Network.

   For the first type of subscribers, a typical LI deployment would be
   similar to the one described earlier for the scenario without
   roaming.

   For Inter-Operator roaming, there are three deployment scenarios for
   handling subscriber traffic:

Internet-Draft          Lawful Intercept Support              March 2013


   o  All the traffic will be tunnelled towards the Home Gateway in the
      Partner network

   o  Selective local breakout of subscriber traffic into the Wi-Fi
      Operators network

   o  Full local break out of subscriber traffic into the Wi-Fi
      Operators network

   Depending up on the country specific legal requirements, it is
   possible for both Roaming partner as well as Wi-Fi operator to be
   responsible for intercepting the subscribers traffic flow while
   connected to the Wi-Fi operator's network.  Even in cases where only
   the roaming partner is responsible, the LI implementation will need
   to account for the LBO which potentially happens in the Wi-Fi
   operator's network.  As such, a standardized LI implementation will
   be desirable for most of the Inter- Operator Roaming scenarios.  One
   approach would be to leverage the existing protocols such as PMIPv6
   and come up with the required extensions to support standards based
   LI solution for inter-operator roaming scenarios.

   A generic LI deployment model with Inter-Operator roaming is
   illustrated in Figure 2 below:

     Figure 2: Generic LI deployment model with Inter-Operator Roaming

   LI specific functional elements and the interfaces defined in the
   above architecture model is also based up on the reference model
   documented in RFC 3924.How ever there are additional components and
   protocol interfaces required to cover the Inter-Operator roaming.

   LI specific control plane interactions between various network
   elements are described in the following steps.

   o  Step-1: Law Enforcement Agency informs the roaming partner about
      the legally authorized intercept requirement for a target
      subscriber.  Roaming partner is the home operator for this
      subscriber.  Typically it will be a manual process of delivering



Pularikkal, et al.     Expires September 14, 2013               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Lawful Intercept Support              March 2013


      the court order to the Roaming Partner's side personel in charge
      of the LI admin function.  Some LI network element vendors may
      also allow interfaces to automate this delivery.  LEA is expected
      to provide a unique Target identifier along with other key
      variables such as duration of the Intercept, whether both IRI and
      CC needs to be forwarded to the LEA etc.  Interface (a) in Figure
      4 represents the administrative handover interface between LEA and
      the Wi-Fi Operator.

   o  Step-2:Roaming Partner side LI Admin network element uses
      interface (b) to provision the Roaming partner's MD with the
      details of the Intercept target.  Depending up on the type of the
      target unique identifier provided by the LEA, it may be required
      by the Roaming Partner's LI Admin function to lookup a
      corresponding subscriber identifier and forward the same to the
      MD.In this case it is assumed that the subscriber session was not
      active at the time of the Intercept.

   o  Step-3:At this point the MD is not aware on which Home Gateway the
      subscriber session may become active.  So MD uses the interface
      (c) to provision the IRI network element.  The IRI network element
      in the partner network typically will be an Authentication/
      Authorization & or Accounting (AAA) System such as a RADIUS or
      DIAMETER server.

   o  Step-4: Target subscriber of the Roaming Partner uses a client
      device to associate to the Wi-Fi Operator's wireless network.
      Depending up on the implementation, subscriber may be able to
      either automatically login using a pre-registered mac-address, or
      some EAP authentication method or he may have to go through a Web
      Portal based authentication.

   o  Step-5: WAG in the Wi-Fi Operator's network,up on detecting a new
      subscriber session will send an Authorization request to the
      Roaming Partner's AAA server which is the IRI IAP.In typical
      deployments there will be a Proxy AAA server on the Wi-Fi
      operators network which will act as the intermediary between the
      WAG and the Roaming Partner's AAA server.  But this is omitted for
      the sake of simplicity.  At this stage it is assumed that the
      subscriber is already authenticated and is authorized to access
      the network.AAA server on the Roaming partner's network sends an
      Authorization Accept back to the WAG so that WAG can install the
      relevant policies to allow network access for the subscriber.  The
      Policy will include the identity of the Home Gateway to which the
      subscriber session will be anchored on the Roaming Partners
      network.  Typically standards based protocol interfaces such as
      RADIUS or DIAMETER will be used for interaction between WAG and
      the AAA server.

   o  Step-6: WAG will establish a packet data session with the
      subscriber's Home Gateway.  As part of this session establishment
      process, Home Gateway will assign an IP address for the subscriber
      and provide it to WAG.  WAG in turn will complete the necessary
      control plane exchanges with Subscriber User Equipment (UE) to
      complete address assignment.  After the packet data session
      establishment is complete, WAG will typically send an Accounting
      Start Message to the AAA server and this message will include the
      IP address of the subscriber along with other relevant info.  If
      the subscriber policy does not allow any Local Breakout (LBO) then
      WAG will forward all data traffic from the subscriber to the Home
      Gateway. if LBO is allowed, the traffic matching the LBO criteria
      will be locally routed by WAG and all other traffic from the
      subscriber will be forwarded to the Home Gateway.

   o  Step-7: The authorization request from the WAG typically carries a
      subscriber identifier such as username or IMSI.  Since the
      subscriber identifier matched a target intercept provisioned on
      the Roaming Operator's AAA server (IRI IAP), IRI IAP will send a
      "Target Active"notification to the MD.  This notification will
      include the Home Gateway identity for the subscriber, the IP
      address of the subcriber and any other relevant IRI information.

   o  Step-8: Mediation device establishes a secured session over
      interface (g) with the LEA collection function and forwards the
      IRI information corresponding to the target subscriber.

   o  Step-9: Mediation Device uses interface (e) to activate the CC
      intercept on the Home Gateway in the Roaming Partner's network.
      MD will include all the required information to duplicate and
      forward the intercepted content such as, a) the destination
      address and port to which the intercepted packets need to be
      forwarded, the duration of the intercept, any applicable filters,
      encryption keys etc.

   o  Step-10: In this model, the WAG residing in the Wi-Fi Operator's
      network is the CC IAP.  This will make sure that that all the
      traffic to and from the subscriber, including any LBO traffic,
      will be duplicated and forwarded to the MD.  Home Gateway uses
      interface (i) to command the WAG to activate intercept for the
      target subscriber.The Home Gateway will forward all the relevant
      information it received from MD related to the Intercept.

   o  Step-11: WAG starts duplicating the target subscriber's
      communication content and forwards the same to the Mediation
      Device over interface (f)

   o  Step-12: MD re-packages the communication content in the required
      format for the LEA and forwards it over interface (h).


4.  Generic SP Wi-Fi Deployment Model without Inter-Operator Roaming
    (Model-2)

   Figure 3 below illustrates a generic SP Wi-Fi deployment without
   Inter-Operator Roaming support.In this architecture model, AP's may
   be deployed in autonomous mode or in a split-MAC using centralized
   wireless controllers.  Depending up on the implementation model in
   use, different tunnel technologies may be in use between AP/WAC and
   the Wireless Access Gateway.  Some of these tunnel technologies are
   CAPWAP, PMIPv6, Ethernet over GRE etc.  Typically all the traffic for
   the subscriber session gets aggregated on the Wireless Access
   Gateway.

   o  Step-1: Law Enforcement Agency informs the Wi-Fi Operator about
      the legally authorized intercept requirement for a target
      subscriber.  Typically it will be a manual process of delivering
      the court order to the Wi-Fi Operator side personnel in charge of
      the LI admin function.  Some LI network element vendors may also
      allow interfaces to automate this delivery.  LEA is expected to
      provide a unique Target identifier along with other key variables
      such as duration of the Intercept, whether both IRI and CC needs
      to be forwarded to the LEA etc.  Interface (a) in Figure 2
      represents the administrative handover interface between LEA and
      the Wi-Fi Operator.

   o  Step-2:Operator side LI Admin network element uses interface (b)
      to provision the Mediation Device with the details of the
      Intercept target.  Depending up on the type of the target unique
      identifier provided by the LEA, it may be required by the Provider
      LI Admin function to lookup a corresponding subscriber identifier
      and forward the same to the MD.In this case it is assumed that the
      subscriber session was not active at the time of the Intercept.

   o  Step-3:At this point the MD is not aware on which WAG, the
      subscriber session may become active.  So MD uses the interface
      (c) to provision the IRI network element.  The IRI network element
      in an SP Wi-Fi network typically will be an Authentication/
      Authorization & or Accounting System such as a RADIUS server.

   o  Step-4: Target subscriber uses a client device to associate to the
      wireless network.  Depending up on the implementation, subscriber
      may be able to either automatically login using a pre-registered
      mac-address, or some EAP authentication method or he may have to
      go through a Web Portal based authentication.

   o  Step-5: WAG up on detecting a new subscriber session will send an
      Authorization request to the IRI network element.  At this stage
      it is assumed that the subscriber is already authenticated and is
      authorized to access the network.IRI network element sends an
      Authorization Accept back to the WAG so that WAG can install the
      relevant policies to allow network access for the subscriber.
      Typically standards based protocol interfaces such as RADIUS or
      DIAMETER will be used for interaction between WAG and the IRI
      element.

   o  Step-6: The authorization request from the WAG typically carries a
      subscriber identifier such as username or IMSI.  Typical
      authorization request will also carry the source IP address of the
      subscriber.  Since the subscriber identifier matched a target
      intercept provisioned on the IRI, IRI will send a "Target Active"
      notification to the MD over interface (d).  This notification will

Internet-Draft          Lawful Intercept Support              March 2013


      include the IP address of the subscriber and any relevant IRI
      information.

   o  Step-7: IRI Network element sends an authorization response back
      to the WAG and WAG implements applicable subscriber policies and
      enables service access for the subscriber session.

   o  Step-8: Mediation device establishes a secured session over
      interface (g) with the LEA collection function and forwards the
      IRI information corresponding to the target subscriber.

   o  Step-9: Mediation Device uses interface (e) to activate the CC
      intercept on the WAG.  MD will include all the required
      information to duplicate and forward the intercepted content such
      as the destination address and port to which the packets need to
      be forwarded, the duration of the intercept, any applicable
      filters etc

   o  Step-10: WAG starts duplicating the target subscriber's
      communication content and forwards the same to the Mediation
      Device over interface (f)

   o  Step-11: MD re-packages the communication content in the required
      format for the LEA and forwards it over interface (h).


5.  Lawful Intercept Deployment Considerations for SP Wi-Fi

5.1.  Proprietary versus Standards based Implementation

   LI implementation is fairly straight forward for the deployments
   which do not support Inter-Operator roaming.  Most of the LI
   equipment vendors accommodate vendor specific protocol interfaces for
   interworking with IAP network elements from various network equipment
   vendors.  Standards based interfaces are primarily confined to the
   Interconnect between the LEA Collection Function Elements and the
   Mediation Device.

   However for the SP Wi-Fi deployment models which supports inter-
   operator roaming, there will be significant advantages in
   standardizing some of the protocol interfaces.  Typically standards
   based protocols such as PMIPv6 or GTP will be used for the control
   plane and data plane connectivity between the WAG in the Wi-Fi
   Operator network and the Home Gateway in the Roaming Partner's
   network.  By defining some protocol extensions, the same control
   plane interface can be leveraged for implementing standards based LI
   related signaling as well.

Internet-Draft          Lawful Intercept Support              March 2013


5.2.  Subscriber Location Tracking Requirements

   Unlike fixed broadband deployments where the location of the
   subscriber can be tracked easily from the source IP address assigned
   to the end user device, the basic nature of Wi-Fi networks makes it
   more complex to track the location of the subcriber under
   surveillance.  A sample IP lookup will not suffice due to the layer-2
   and layer-3 roaming supported by most of the deployments.  Additional
   intelligence can be implemented to collect the location specific
   information and it can be provided as the IRI data to the LEA if
   required by law.  In Inter- Operator roaming scenarios, it is
   possible to carry the location data also over the standards based
   protocols such as PMIPv6 or GTP by using some relevant protocol
   extensions.

5.3.  Handling SIPTO Traffic for Lawful Intercept

   For Inter-operator roaming deployments, local breakout of roaming
   subscriber in the visited WiFi network is a typical implementation
   scenario.  This Local Breakout is also known as Selective IP Traffic
   Offload (SIPTO).  When SIPTO is enabled in the Inter-operator roaming
   scenario, it typically happens at the WAG in the Wi-Fi Operators
   network.  There are two scenarios with handling SIPTO traffic.  SIPTO
   without NAT and SIPTO with NAT.  For the scenario without NAT,
   dealing with SIPTO for LI is fairly straight forward.  In the LI
   Architecture model covered for the Inter-Operator Roaming Scenario in
   this document, WAG acting as the CC IAP can forward both SIPTO and
   non-SIPTO traffic towards the MD in the Roaming Partner's network.
   For a scenario where IAP Intercept happens at the Home Gateway
   instead of at the WAG, some additional signaling can be done over the
   control plane between Home Gateway and WAG to temporarily disable
   SIPTO for the target subscriber when the target is under
   surveillance.

   SIPTO with NAT can make the implementation more complex.  If the NAT
   function for SIPTO traffic is done at the WAG itself, WAG has access
   to the NAT binding info per subscriber.  If WAG is the CC IAP in the
   Inter-Operator roaming scenario for the roaming partner's subscriber
   the WAG can forward the NAT binding info over the control plane to
   the Home Gateway in the roaming partner's network.  This can be
   included in the scope of the protocol extensions required on the
   tunneling technologies for LI related signaling between Home Gateway
   and WAG.  Since Home Gateway actively participates in the Intercept
   for the target in the Inter-Operator Roaming Scenario, Home Gateway
   can forward this info to the MD over the interface between Home
   Gateway and Mediation Device.  If the NAT function for SIPTO traffic
   runs on a separate box than the WAG , then alternative options will
   need to be considered.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not requires any IANA actions.


7.  Security Considerations

   In order to make sure that only authorized personal can enable the
   intercept for a target subscriber and an active intercept is
   undetectable by the intercept target and any individuals within or
   outside the Wi-Fi Operators and Roaming partners network LI
   implementation will need to make sure that all the LI specific
   protocol signaling is carried out over secured encrypted transport.
   For example if PMIPv6 is the tunnel technology used for an Inter-
   operator roaming scenario, any LI specific signaling carried over the
   PMIPv6 control plane must be encrypted.  Also proper privacy
   mechanisms should be implemented for the transport of IRI and CC data
   from the corresponding IAPs to the Mediation device.  And this is
   particularly important when IAP for CC is in the Wi-Fi operators
   network and the MD is in the roaming partners network.

   privacy must be enabled for the control plane messages by using ESP
   protection.

   MAG will receive all the necessary information to establish a secured
   communication channel to the Mediation Device and transport the
   intercepted packets.  Privacy and Confidentiality of the Intercept
   will be maintained by enabling data privacy for this communication
   channel.  LMA can collect the encription keys from the MD over
   interface (e) and forward them over the PMIPv6 signaling plane along
   with other LI specific parameters.  MAG can leverage these keys to
   encrypt the intercepted packets it forwards to the Mediation Device.

   If the Intercept Target roams from one MAG to another while the CC
   Intercept is active, the LMA will provide the LI specific parameters
   to the new MAG along with standard mobility related information via
   the PMIPv6 Control Plane.  Old MAG will cease the intercept operation
   since the target is no longer attached to it and the new MAG will
   start forwarding the Intercepted packets to the Mediation Device.
   LMA in the background will have informed MD about the Inter-MAG
   handover of the Intercept Target over interface (e).

   It is possible that the Intercept of a Target is conditional to the
   location in which the target is active.  In the case of an Inter-MAG
   handover, if the new MAG on which the target has become active is
   outside the location of "interest", MD will inform LMA to cease the
   intercept and LMA in this case will not provide any LI specific
   information to the new MAG.  As long as the LI provisioning of the
   Target is valid on the LMA, LMA will keep informing the MD about the
   location changes of the target, every time the inter-MAG hand over
   happens and MD can instruct LMA to re-activate the intercept if the
   target ends up getting back on a MAG which is with in the "location"
   of interest.
