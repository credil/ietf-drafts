  CDNI Logging Formats for HTTP and HTTP Adaptive Streaming Deliveries
               draft-lefaucheur-cdni-logging-delivery-00

Abstract

   The interconnection of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) is
   motivated by several use cases.  CDN Interconnection can be achieved
   through four CDNI interfaces, one of which is the CDNI Logging
   interface.  This document discusses CDNI logging formats for content
   deliveries performed using HTTP or HTTP adaptive streaming.

Internet-Draft       CDNI Logging for HTTP Delivery        February 2012


1.  Introduction

   The interconnection of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) is
   motivated by several use cases, such as those described in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases].  The overall problem space for CDN
   Interconnection (CDNI) is described in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-statement].  The CDN Interconnection framework
   is defined in [I-D.davie-cdni-framework] and the requirements for the
   CDN Interconnection solution are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements].

   One of the CDNI interfaces defined in these documents is the CDNI
   Logging interface whose description is quoted here:

   "o CDNI Logging interface: This interface allows the Logging system
   in interconnected CDNs to communicate the relevant activity logs in
   order to allow log consuming applications to operate in a multi-CDN
   environments.  For example, an upstream CDN may collect delivery logs
   from a downstream CDN in order to perform consolidated charging of
   the CSP or for settlement purposes across CDNs.  Similarly, an
   upstream CDN may collect delivery logs from a downstream CDN in order
   to provide consolidated reporting and monitoring to the CSP."

   The logging interface is also discussed in further details in
   [I-D.bertrand-cdni-logging].

   As discussed in the CDNI framework [I-D.davie-cdni-framework] logs
   associated with content delivery using HTTP adaptive streaming have
   specific requirements in terms of summarization:

   "Most schemes to deliver HTTP-based adaptive bit-rate video use a
   large number of relatively small HTTP requests (e.g., one request per
   3-second chunk of video.)  It may be desirable to aggregate Logging
   information so that a single log entry is provided for the entire
   video rather than for each chunk.  Note however that such aggregation
   requires a degree of application awareness in dCDN to recognize that
   the many HTTP requests correspond to a single video."

   The prime purpose of this document is to define CDNI Logging formats
   corresponding to content delivery that uses HTTP or HTTP adaptive
   streaming.

   Section 2 discusses the aspect of CDNI Logging that are specific to
   content delivery performed via regular HTTP.  Section 3 discusses the
   aspect of CDNI Logging that are specific to content delivery
   performed via HTTP adaptive streaming.  Section 5 discusses the
   aspect of CDNI Logging that are generic to all the CDNI Logs for
   delivery.

   CDNI Logging for other events than content delivery (e.g. failures,
   request routing, service monitoring,...) will be discussed in
   subsequent versions.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses all terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-statement].  In addition, we introduce the
   following terminology:

   o  HTTP Adaptive Streaming Segment (or Segment): piece of a content
      item that is accessible as a standalone HTTP resource, and thus is
      discreetly accessible via its own Unique Resource Identifier
      (URI).

   o  HTTP Adaptive Streaming Logging Session (or Session): state
      maintained by the delivering CDN allowing association, for logging
      purposes, of the actions (e.g. delivery of Segments) corresponding
      to a given content request by a given End User.  Note that actions
      associated with a given Session may all be performed by a single
      Surrogate of the delivering CDN, or may be performed by different
      Surrogates of the delivering CDN successively (e.g. in case of
      surrogate fail-over) or performed by different Surrogates in
      parallel (e.g. in case of load-balancing of Segments delivery).

   o  Adaptive Streaming Manifest File (or Manifest File): file that
      indicates to the End-User the information (e.g. content
      representations available, rules for mapping between a content
      Segment and its URI) necessary to request the appropriate Segment
      at the appropriate time based on the End-User adaptive logic (e.g.
      increase bitrate, decrease bitrate) and behavior (e.g. seek,
      pause, play).


2.  CDNI Logging for regular HTTP Delivery

   This section discusses the triggers on which a CDNI log is generated
   for delivery of content using regular HTTP delivery, as well as the
   fields contained in the corresponding log.

2.1.  Regular HTTP Log Triggers

   A CDNI Log is generated for a regular HTTP delivery on the following
   triggers:

3.  CDNI Logging for HTTP Adaptive Streaming

   This section discusses the CDNI logs for delivery of content using
   HTTP adaptive streaming.

3.1.  HTTP Adaptive Logging Session

   There are multiple methods by which the delivering CDN can create/
   maintain/delete an HTTP Adaptive Streaming Logging Session.

   As a first example method, the delivering CDN may create a Session on
   successful authorization of delivery of the Manifest File for a
   particular End-User content request, create a per-Session coookie and
   then validate the association of Segment requests with the Session
   through HTTP cookie mechanisms.  The delivering CDN may then maintain
   the Session as long as Segment requests are being received for that
   Session.  The delivering CDN may ultimately delete the Session once
   Segment requests for that Session are no longer received for some
   period of time.

   As another example, Session identification information included in
   the fragment URIs may be used by the delivering CDN to associate
   Segment requests with a Session and therefore for determining when a
   Session is to be created/maintained/deleted.

   Methods for tracking HTTP Adaptive Streaming Logging Sessions in a

   delivering CDN are implementation specific and thus outside the scope
   of the present document.

3.2.  CDNI Log formats for HTTP Adaptive Streaming

   Three CDNI Logging formats are defined for delivery using HTTP
   adaptive streaming:

   o  Segment-Based Logging, as specified in Section 3.2.1.

   o  Event-Based Logging, as specified in Section 3.2.2.

   o  Summary-based Logging, as specified in Section 3.2.3.

   An implementation of the CDNI Logging interface MUST support logging
   for delivery of content using HTTP adaptive streaming in the Segment-
   Based Logging format and the Event-Based Logging format, and MAY
   support logging in the Summary-Based Logging format.

   By default (i.e. unless it is explicitly requested that another
   format be used as discussed in Section 6), CDNI logs for delivery of
   content using HTTP adaptive streaming MUST be formatted as per the
   Event-Based format.

3.2.1.  Segment-Based Logging

3.2.1.1.  Segment-Based Log Triggers

   A Segment-Based Log is generated on the following triggers:

   +---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | Event               | Description                                 |

   | Segment/Manifest    | Reception of a request for a Segment (or    |
   | Request             | Manifest File)                              |
   +---------------------+---------------------------------------------+

3.2.1.2.  Segment-Based Log fields

   A Segment-based Log for HTTP adaptive streaming contains all the same
   fields as a CDNI Log for a regular HTTP request as well as the
   following additional fields:

3.2.2.  Event-Based Logging

3.2.2.1.  Event-Based Log Triggers

   An Event-Based Log is generated on the following triggers:

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | Event          | Description                                      |
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | Representation | Reception of a request for a Segment whose       |
   | Change/Bitrate | bitrate is higher than the bitrate of the        |
   | Upshift.       | previously requested Segment.                    |
   | Representation | Reception of a request for a Segment whose       |
   | Change/Bitrate | bitrate is lower than the bitrate of the         |
   | Downshift.     | previously requested Segment.                    |
   | Representation | TBD                                              |
   | Change/TBD.    |                                                  |
   | Session Seek.  | Reception of a request for a Segment whose       |
   |                | playtime is not sequentially following the       |
   |                | previously requested Segment.                    |
   | Session Stop.  | Determination by delivering CDN that the         |
   |                | End-User has temporarily stopped requesting      |
   |                | Segments associated with the Session.  This may  |
   |                | be determined using heuristics such as           |
   |                | expiration of a time-out (e.g. of 10 seconds)    |
   |                | after reception of the last Segment request.     |
   | Session Close. | Determination by delivering CDN that the         |
   |                | End-User has definitively stopped requesting     |
   |                | Segments associated with the Session.  This may  |
   |                | be determined using heuristics such as           |
   |                | expiration of a time-out after any End-USer      |
   |                | activity associated with the Session.            |
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

3.2.2.2.  Event-Based Log Fields

   An Event-Based Log for HTTP adaptive streaming contains all the same
   fields as a Segment-Based Log as well as the following additional
   fields:

   +------------+----------------------+-------------------------------+
   | Field      | Description          | Examples                      |
   +------------+----------------------+-------------------------------+
   | event-code | Event that triggered | Representation Change/Bitrate |
   |            | the generation of    | Upshift, Session Seek,        |
   |            | the log              | Session Stop, ...             |

3.2.3.  Summary-Based Logging

3.2.3.1.  Summary-Based Log Triggers

   A Summary-Based Log is generated on the following triggers:

   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Event        | Description                                        |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Session      | Determination by delivering CDN that the End-User  |
   | Close        | has definitively stopped requesting Segments       |
   |              | associated with the Session.  This may be          |
   |              | determined using heuristics such as expiration of  |
   |              | a time-out after any End-USer activity associated  |
   |              | with the Session.                                  |
   | Intermediate | Expiration of a Logging Period Time-out since a    |
   | Logging      | previous Summary-Based Log was generated for that  |
   | Period       | Session (or since the start of the Session).       |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+

3.2.3.2.  Summary-Based Log Fields

   An Event-Based Log for HTTP adaptive streaming contains all the same
   fields as a Segment-Based Log, minus the Representation field, plus
   the following additional fields:

   [This will be specified in subsequent versions.  The objective is to
   define fields that summarize succinctly -while retaining enough
   information- the fluctuations in content representation (e.g.
   bitrate/quality variations) as well as stop/start/seek patterns over
   the duration of the Session (or over the Intermediate Logging period)
   for the audio and video components. ]


4.  Performance Monitoring

   The CDNI Log fields listed in the previous sections allow monitoring
   of essential delivery performance indicators across the CDN Mesh.
   For example, for a regular HTTP delivery, these fields allow tracking
   of the time taken to serve the requested content, tracking of content
   delivery failures, tracking of partial deliveries and tracking of
   cache hit ratios.  As another example, for HTTP adaptive streaming,
   these fields allow tracking of the presentation (and its fluctuation
   over time) served to the End-User as well as the End-User random
   content access (e.g.  Play/Stop/Seek).

   Subsequent versions of this document will discuss potential
   additional log fields for enhanced performance monitoring.

5.  CDNI Log Encoding and Transport

   Details for CDNI Log encoding and transport will be specified in
   subsequent versions.  However, Section 5.1 identifies the information
   that is to be included in the header of CDNI Logs, Section 5.2
   identifies information that is to be attached to every CDNI Log
   record and Section 5.3 identifies the information that is to be
   included in the footer of CDNI Logs.

5.1.  CDNI Log Header Information

   The header of CDNI Logs contains the following fields:

   +----------------+-------------------+------------------------------+
   | Field          | Description       | Examples                     |

   +----------------+-------------------+------------------------------+

5.2.  CDNI per-Log-Record Information

   In addition to the log fields discussed in previous sections, each
   CDNI log record contains the following fields:

   +----------+---------------------------------------------+----------+
   | Field    | Description                                 | Examples |
   +----------+---------------------------------------------+----------+

5.3.  CDNI Log Footer Information

   The footer of CDNI Logs contains the following fields:

   +---------+----------------------------------------------+----------+
   | Field   | Description                                  | Examples |

   | Digest  | detection of Log corruption)                 |          |
   +---------+----------------------------------------------+----------+


6.  Impact on CDNI Metadata Requirements

   We request that the following requirement be added in section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements]:

   "

   META-X [HIGH] The CDNI Metadata Distribution interface shall support
   an optional mechanism allowing the Upstream CDN to indicate to the
   Downstream CDN which CDNI Log format is to be provided for all, for
   specific sets of, or for specific content items delivered using HTTP
   adaptive streaming.

   ".

   A CDNI implementation that does not support this optional CDNI
   Metadata Distribution Interface mechanism MUST ignore this log format
   indication and generate CDNI logging format for adaptive streaming
   using the default CDNI Logging format for such delivery.


7.  Generation of CDNI Logs

   Like other CDNI interfaces, the CDNI Logging interface specifies
   operations across CDNs and not inside a CDN.  Therefore, the log
   formats specified in this document apply to CDNI logging information
   exchanged across CDNs and does not constrain the process for
   generating such inter-CDN logs within a given CDN.  The format of the
   logs generated by a given CDN Surrogate is beyond the scope of the
   present document.  We observe that a given CDN could elect to have
   its Surrogates natively generate logs in the same format as the one
   to be used for exchange with another CDN, or that the CDN could elect
   to have its Surrogates generate logs in any other format (as long as
   they include the necessary information) and have these logs then
   reformatted prior to exchange with another CDN.

8.  IANA Considerations

   [This will be specified in subsequent versions].


9.  Security Considerations

   CDNI Logs exchanged over the CDNI Logging interface can be consumed
   by very sensitive applications including inter-CDN accounting and
   billing.  The associated security concerns are discussed in
   [I-D.davie-cdni-framework].  At this stage, we observe that the CDNI
   Logging interface can leverage the existing security mechanisms
   supported by the underlying transport protocol that will be selected
   for transport of CDNI Logs (e.g. to support authentication of the
   entities exchanging CDNI Logs through the CDNI Logging interface, to
   support privacy and protection against spoofing).  This will be
   further discussed in subsequent versions of this document.
