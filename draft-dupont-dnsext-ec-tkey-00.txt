Internet-Draft                  ECDH TKEY                  February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The TKEY resource record [RFC2930] was designed to enable the
   establishment of a shared secret between DNS client and server, using
   GSS-API or a Diffie-Hellman exchange.

   The purpose of this document is to modernize the cryptography used by
   the Diffie-Hellman variant of TKEY, i.e., to move to ECDH (Elliptic
   Curve Diffie-Hellman).  As a side effect, registries for the DH KEY
   [RFC2539] and SIG(0) [RFC2931] resource records are updated.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].


2.  ECDH groups

   This document specifies a new "well-known group" with a 1536 bit
   prime for the DH KEY resource record [RFC2539], taken from the
   expired revision [I-D.ietf-dnsext-rfc2539bis-dhk], in the Appendix A.
   (this group is supported by some implementations, the idea is to make
   it official)

   The NIST P-256 and P-384 curve groups are added as groups 13 and 14.
   These groups are already used in several IETF RFCs, including
   [RFC5114], or for DNSSEC [RFC6605].  A public key is the uncompressed
   form of a curve point, so on twice 256 or 384 bits.  The shared
   secret is the first coordinate of the Diffie-Hellman common value, so
   on 256 or 384 bits.


3.  ECDH TKEY

   The ECDH TKEY reuses the DH TKEY (RFC2930 [RFC2930] section 4.1)
   specification with some changes.

   The Diffie-Hellman exchange uses the Elliptic Curve P-256 group, the
   hash function is SHA-256.

   The "key data" lengths MUST be at least 128 bits / 16 octets, and
   SHOULD be at most 256 bits / 32 octets.

   The "keying material" is derived using the formula (taken from IKEv2
   [RFC4306]):

         keymat = HMAC-SHA-256(query data | server data, ECDH value)

4.  IANA Considerations

   The "DNS KEY Record Diffie-Hellman Well-Known Prime/Generator Pairs"
   registry is modified by the addition of entries for 3, 13 and 14,
   with "A 1536 bit prime", "EC P-256" and "EC P-384" for descriptions,
   and this document for the reference.

   The "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers" registry is modified by adding
   TKEY in the "transaction security mechanisms" and by making
   ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSAP384SHA384 eligible for transaction
   security.

   The "SIG (0) Algorithm Numbers" registry is either updated / aligned
   with the preceding one, or simply suppressed as its content was
   merged into the preceding one.


5.  Security Considerations

   The Elliptic Curve cryptography is considered as being as safe as the
   modular prime field one but with faster operations and far smaller
   payloads, so should be a vector for better security.

   In the same way, more support and use of TKEY should be encouraged.
   This is why it had to be re-based on modern cryptography tools.

   To share a private key for two different usages is recognized as a
   bad practice, so when an ECDH TKEY is authenticated by
   ECDSAP256SHA256, the private key SHOULD NOT be shared.
