Abstract

   Although access control for home servers is very important,
   managements and setups of access controls are difficult for most of
   users.  "Connecting a new node to the same link" is easiest way of
   access control.  One of solutions is to use link-local addresses for
   communications of clients and servers.

1.  Introduction

   The homenet architecture [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch] treats large,
   complex home networks.  There may not be network experts to manage
   home networks.  Considering simple and small home network is useful.

1.1.  Problem statement

   Homenet may have local networks and guest networks.  The access
   control to home network servers is very important because some
   servers should not be accessed from guest networks.

   Initial setups and operations of access controls are difficult for
   most of users.  WiFi and Bluetooth support easy configuration
   mechanism.  "Connecting a new node to the same link", or "connecting
   a new node and push a button/pin" are easiest way to configure the
   new node that can relate with a home server.

1.2.  Possible solution

   There are some solutions.  Using link-local address between clients
   and servers restricts access to servers.  "Connecting a new node to
   the same link" is usable as an access control.  It is described in
   Section 3.

   Using Unique Local Address (ULA) address between clients and servers
   limits access to servers.  It is described in Section 4.

   Otherwise, we need another solutions.

2.  Terminology

   A guest network is a network which can access the Internet and cannot
   access home servers.  A local network is a network which can access
   the Internet and home servers.

3.  Homenet using Link-Local address

   Suppose there is only a local network in a home and there may be a
   guest network.  Two types of networks are common because recent CPEs
   have multiple SSID function which separates internal network and
   guest network.  Link-Local addresses are able to point entities in
   the local network.  Link-local servers within the local network serve
   services to clients using link-local address only.  Link-local
   servers will accept requests from link-local addresses.  Link-local
   servers should reject requests from another addresses.  Link-local
   servers may act as a normal IPv6 client (for its internal use: They
   can get IPv6 prefixes from CPEs and can connect to the internet via

   CPEs).

   Name resolutions inside the local network may be performed by "ICMPv6
   Node Information Queries" [RFC4620] or another methods (mDNS
   [RFC4795]).  The problem is that [RFC4620] is an EXPERIMENTAL RFC.

   Pros:

      *  It does not need internet connectivity and can work without
         CPEs

      *  Other communications are not affected by this proposal.

      *  Easy to manage by users.

      *  mDNS or IPv6 Node Information Queries are usable for name
         resolutions.

      *  Easy to separate local networks and guest networks

      *  DNS is used for global name resolution only

   Cons:

      *  Existing client applications may not support link-local
         addresses

      *  Link-local client should cache link-local server information
         with symbolic name and link-local addresses.

      *  Existing server software may not support link-local addresses
         correctly.

      *  It does not support multiple links easily.  Link-local servers
         can have multiple network interfaces and they can support
         multiple links.

4.  Homenet using ULA

   ULAs are able to point entities in the network.  Connecting new nodes
   into a homenet gives access to home servers.

   Pros:

      *  It supports multiple links easily

      *  It does not need internet connectivity

      *  Easy to manage by users.

   Cons:

      *  Some filtering or access control method is required for
         protecting servers.

      *  CPEs and internal routers need to know ULAs. (need to develop
         ULA configuration methods)

      *  Requires new name resolution mechanism. (site mDNS?)

5.  Homenet using global addresses

   Global addresses are able to point entities in the network.  This
   case is the same as enterprise networks.

6.  Security Considerations

7.  IANA considerations

Appendix A.  Link-local Examples

A.1.  Example 1: 1 local net + 1 guest net

   Figure 1 shows 1 local network and 1 guest network example.  Guest1
   and Guest2 cannot access to Server1 and Server2.  Guest1 and Guest2
   can access the Internet.  Client1 can access Server1, Server2 and the
   Internet.
