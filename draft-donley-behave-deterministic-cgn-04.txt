  Deterministic Address Mapping to Reduce Logging in Carrier Grade NAT
                              Deployments
                draft-donley-behave-deterministic-cgn-04

Abstract

   Abuse response in a Carrier Grade NAT environment requires Service
   Providers to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the
   address used on the public Internet.  Unfortunately, many Carrier
   Grade NAT abuse-response solutions require per-connection logging.
   Research indicates that such logging is not scalable to many
   residential broadband services.  This document suggests a way to
   manage Carrier Grade NAT translations in such a way as to
   significantly reduce the amount of logging required while providing
   traceability for abuse response.  While the authors acknowledge that
   IPv6 is a preferred solution, Carrier Grade NAT is a reality in many
   networks, and is needed in situations where either customer equipment
   or Internet content only supports IPv4; this approach should in no
   way slow the deployment of IPv6.

1.  Introduction

   The world is rapidly running out of unallocated IPv4 addresses.  To
   ensure IPv4 service continuity under the growing demands from new
   subscribers, devices, and service types, some ISPs will be forced to
   share a single public IPv4 address among multiple subscribers using
   techniques such as Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGN)
   [RFC6264] (e.g., NAT444 [I-D.shirasaki-nat444], DS-Lite [RFC6333],
   NAT64 [RFC6146]etc.).  However, address sharing poses additional
   challenges to ISPs in responding to public safety requests or attack/
   abuse reports [RFC6269].  In order to respond to such requests to
   identify a specific user associated with an IP address, an ISP will
   need to map a subscriber's internal source IP address and source port
   with the global public IP address and source port provided by the CGN
   for every connection initiated by the user.

   CGN connection logging satisfies the need to identify attackers and
   respond to abuse/public safety requests, but it imposes significant
   operational challenges to ISPs.  In lab testing, we have observed CGN
   log messages to be approximately 150 bytes long for NAT444
   [I-D.shirasaki-nat444], and 175 bytes for DS-Lite [RFC6333]
   (individual log messages vary somewhat in size).  Although we are not
   aware of definitive studies of connection rates per subscriber,
   reports from several ISPs in the US sets the average number of
   connections per household at approximately 33,000 connections per
   day.  If each connection is individually logged, this translates to a
   data volume of approximately 5 MB per subscriber per day, or about
   150 MB per subscriber per month; however, specific data volumes may
   vary across different ISPs based on myriad factors.  Based on
   available data, a 1-million subscriber service provider will generate
   approximately 150 terabytes of log data per month, or 1.8 petabytes
   per year.

   The volume of log data poses a problem for both ISPs and the public
   safety community.  On the ISP side, it requires a significant
   infrastructure investment by ISPs implementing CGN.  It also requires
   updated operational practices to maintain the logging infrastructure,
   and requires approximately 23 Mbps of bandwidth between the CGN
   devices and the logging infrastructure.  On the public safety side,
   it increases the time required for an ISP to search the logs in
   response to an abuse report, and could delay investigations.
   Accordingly, an international group of ISPs and public safety
   officials approached the authors to identify a way to reduce this
   impact while improving abuse response.

   The volume of CGN logging can be reduced by assigning port ranges
   instead of individual ports.  Using this method, only the assignment
   of a new port range is logged.  This may massively reduce logging



Donley, et al.          Expires January 12, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              deterministic-cgn                  July 2012


   volume.  The log reduction may vary depending on the length of the
   assigned port range, whether the port range is static or dynamic,
   etc.  This has been acknowledged in [RFC6269]:

   "Address sharing solutions may mitigate these issues to some extent
   by pre-allocating groups of ports.  Then only the allocation of the
   group needs to be recorded, and not the creation of every session
   binding within that group.  There are trade-offs to be made between
   the sizes of these port groups, the ratio of public addresses to
   subscribers, whether or not these groups timeout, and the impact on
   logging requirements and port randomization security (RFC6056)
   [RFC6056]."

   However, the existing solution still poses an impact on ISPs and
   public safety officials for logging and searching.  Instead, CGNs
   could be designed and/or configured to deterministically map internal
   addresses to {external address + port range} in such a way as to be
   able to algorithmically calculate the mapping.  Only inputs and
   configuration of the algorithm need to be logged.  This approach
   reduces both logging volume and subscriber identification times.

   This document describes a method for such CGN address mapping,
   combined with block port reservations, that significantly reduces the
   burden on ISPs while offering the ability to map a subscriber's
   inside IP address with an outside address and external port number
   observed on the Internet.

   The activation of the proposed port range allocation scheme is
   compliant with BEHAVE requirements such as the support of APP.


2.  Deterministic Port Ranges

   While a subscriber uses thousands of connections per day, most
   subscribers use far fewer at any given time.  When the compression
   ratio (see Appendix B of RFC6269 [RFC6269]) is low (e.g., the ratio
   of the number of subscribers to the number of public IPv4 addresses
   allocated to a CGN is closer to 10:1 than 1000:1), each subscriber
   could expect to have access to thousands of TCP/UDP ports at any
   given time.  Thus, as an alternative to logging each connection, CGNs
   could deterministically map customer private addresses (received on
   the customer-facing interface of the CGN, a.k.a., internal side) to
   public addresses extended with port ranges (used on the Internet-
   facing interface of the CGN, a.k.a., external side).  This algorithm
   allows an operator to identify a subscriber internal IP address when
   provided the public side IP and port number without having to examine
   the CGN translation logs.  This prevents an operator from having to
   transport and store massive amounts of session data from the CGN and



Donley, et al.          Expires January 12, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              deterministic-cgn                  July 2012


   then process it to identify a subscriber.

   The algorithmic mapping can be expressed as:

   (External IP Address, Port Range) = function 1 (Internal IP Address)

   Internal IP Address = function 2 (External IP Address, Port Number)

   The CGN SHOULD provide a method for users to test both mapping
   functions (e.g., enter an External IP Address + Port Number and
   receive the corresponding Internal IP Address).

   Deterministic Port Range allocation requires configuration of the
   following variables:

   o  Inside IPv4/IPv6 address range (I);

   o  Outside IPv4 address range (O);

   o  Compression ratio (e.g. inside IP addresses I/outside IP addresses
      O) (C);

   o  Dynamic address pool factor (D), to be added to the compression
      ratio in order to create an overflow address pool;

   o  Maximum ports per user (M);

   o  Address assignment algorithm (A) (see below); and

   o  Reserved TCP/UDP port list (R)

   Note: The inside address range (I) will be an IPv4 range in NAT444
   operation (NAT444 [I-D.shirasaki-nat444]) and an IPv6 range in DS-
   Lite operation (DS-Lite [RFC6333]).

   A subscriber is identified by an internal IPv4 address (e.g., NAT44)
   or an IPv6 prefix (e.g., DS-Lite or NAT64).

   The algorithm may be generalized to L2-aware NAT
   [I-D.miles-behave-l2nat] but this requires the configuration of the
   Internal interface identifiers (e.g., MAC addresses).

   The algorithm is not designed to retrieve an internal host among
   those sharing the same internal IP address (e.g., in a DS-Lite
   context, only an IPv6 address/prefix can be retrieved using the
   algorithm while the internal IPv4 address used for the encapsulated
   IPv4 datagram is lost).

   Several address assignment algorithms are possible.  Using predefined
   algorithms, such as those that follow, simplifies the process of
   reversing the algorithm when needed.  However, additional algorithms
   can also be supported.  Subscribers could be restricted to ports from
   a single IPv4 address, or could be allocated ports across all
   addresses in a pool, for example.  The following algorithms and
   corresponding values of A are as follow:

      0: Sequential (e.g. the first block goes to address 1, the second
      block to address 2, etc.)

      1: Staggered (e.g. for every n between 0 and ((65536-R)/(C+D))-1 ,
      address 1 receives ports n*C+R, address 2 receives ports
      (1+n)*C+R, etc.)

      2: Spread horizontally (e.g. the subscriber receives the same port
      number across a pool of external IP addresses.  If the subscriber
      is to be assigned more ports than there are in the external IP
      pool, the subscriber receives the next highest port across the IP
      pool, and so on.  Thus, if there are 10 IP addresses in a pool and
      a subscriber is assigned 1000 ports, the subscriber would receive
      a range such as ports 2000-2099 across all 10 external IP
      addresses).

      3: Interlaced horizontally (e.g. each address receives every Cth
      port spread across a pool of external IP addresses).

      4: Cryptographically random port assignment (Section 2.2 of
      RFC6431 [RFC6431]).  If this algorithm is used, the Service
      Provider needs to retain the keying material and specific
      cryptographic function to support reversibility.

      5: Vendor-specific.  Other vendor-specific algorithms may also be
      supported.

   The assigned range of ports MAY also be used when translating ICMP
   requests (when re-writing the Identifier field).

   The CGN then reserves ports as follows:

   1.  The CGN removes reserved ports from the port candidate list
       (e.g., 0-1023 for TCP and UDP).  At a minimum, the CGN SHOULD
       remove system ports (RFC6335) [RFC6335] from the port candidate
       list reserved for deterministic assignment.

   2.  The CGN calculates the total compression ratio (C+D), and
       allocates 1/(C+D) of the available ports to each internal IP
       address.  Any remaining ports are allocated to the dynamic pool.



Donley, et al.          Expires January 12, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              deterministic-cgn                  July 2012


   3.  When a subscriber initiates a connection, the CGN creates a
       translation mapping between the subscriber's inside local IP
       address/port and the CGN outside global IP address/port.  The CGN
       MUST use one of the ports allocated in step 2 for the translation
       as long as such ports are available.  The CGN MUST use the
       preallocated port range from step 2 for Port Control Protocol
       (PCP, [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]) reservations as long as such ports are
       available.  While the CGN maintains its mapping table, it need
       not generate a log entry for translation mappings created in this
       step.

   4.  The CGN will have a pool of ports left for dynamic assignment.
       If a subscriber uses more than the range of ports allocated in
       step 2 (but fewer than the configured maximum ports M), the CGN
       uses a port from the dynamic assignment range for such a
       connection or for PCP reservations.  The CGN MUST log dynamically
       assigned ports to facilitate subscriber-to-address mapping.  The
       CGN SHOULD manage dynamic ports as described in
       [I-D.tsou-behave-natx4-log-reduction].

   5.  Configuration of reserved ports (e.g., system ports) is left to
       operator configuration.

   Thus, the CGN will maintain translation mapping information for all
   connections within its internal translation tables; however, it only
   needs to externally log translations for dynamically-assigned ports.

2.1.  Stability and Load-Balancing Considerations

   Using the procedure defined in this document assumes a deterministic
   distribution of customers among deployed CGN devices.  Balancing the
   traffic among several CGNs based on their actual load may not be
   supported because of the potential conflict of enforced algorithmic
   mapping rule.  When CGN redundancy group is used, the same mapping
   rule, including in particular the external IP address, MUST be used.
   Furthermore, traffic oscillation MUST be avoided (because, unless
   state synchronization is used, the actual NAT state may not be
   instantiated in the redundancy group).

2.2.  IPv4 Port Utilization Efficiency

   For Service Providers requiring an aggressive address sharing ration,
   the use of the algorithmic mapping may impact the efficiency of the
   address sharing.  Using a dynamic port range scheme, dynamic port
   assignment or a mix of static mapping and dynamic port assignment is
   more suitable for those SPs.

2.3.  Planning & Dimensioning

   Unlike dynamic approaches, the use of the algorithmic mapping
   requires more effort from operational teams to tweak the algorithm
   (e.g., size of the port range, address sharing ratio, etc.).
   Dedicated alarms SHOULD be configured when some port utilization
   thresholds are fired so that the configuration can be refined.

2.4.  Deterministic CGN Example

   To illustrate the use of deterministic NAT, let's consider a simple
   example.  The operator configures an inside address range (I) of
   100.64.0.0/28 and outside address (O) of 203.0.113.1.  The dynamic
   address pool factor (D) is set to '2'.  Thus, the total compression
   ratio is 1:(14+2) = 1:16.  Only the system ports (e.g. ports < 1024)
   are reserved.  This configuration causes the CGN to preallocate
   ((65536-1024)/16 =) 4032 TCP and 4032 UDP ports per inside IPv4
   address.  For the purposes of this example, let's assume that they
   are allocated sequentially, where 100.64.0.1 maps to 203.0.113.1
   ports 1024-5055, 100.64.0.2 maps to 203.0.113.1 ports 5056-9087, etc.
   The dynamic port range thus contains ports 57472-65535 (port
   allocation illustrated in the table below).  Finally, the maximum
   ports/subscriber is set to 5040.

            +-----------------------+-------------------------+
            | Inside Address / Pool | Outside Address & Port  |
            +-----------------------+-------------------------+

            | 100.64.0.11           | 203.0.113.1:41344-45375 |
            | 100.64.0.12           | 203.0.113.1:45376-49407 |
            | 100.64.0.13           | 203.0.113.1:49408-53439 |
            | 100.64.0.14           | 203.0.113.1:53440-57471 |
            | Dynamic               | 203.0.113.1:57472-65535 |
            +-----------------------+-------------------------+

   When subscriber 1 using 100.64.0.1 initiates a low volume of
   connections (e.g. < 4032 concurrent connections), the CGN maps the
   outgoing source address/port to the preallocated range.  These



Donley, et al.          Expires January 12, 2013                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              deterministic-cgn                  July 2012


   translation mappings are not logged.

   Subscriber 2 concurrently uses more than the allocated 4032 ports
   (e.g. for peer-to-peer, mapping, video streaming, or other
   connection-intensive traffic types), the CGN allocates up to an
   additional 1008 ports using bulk port reservations.  In this example,
   subscriber 2 uses outside ports 5056-9087, and then 100-port blocks
   between 58000-58999.  Connections using ports 5056-9087 are not
   logged, while 10 log entries are created for ports 58000-58099,
   58100-58199, 58200-58299, ..., 58900-58999.

   If a public safety agency reports abuse from 203.0.113.1, port 2001,
   the operator can reverse the mapping algorithm to determine that the
   internal IP address subscriber 1 has been assigned generated the
   traffic without consulting CGN logs (by correlating the internal IP
   address with DHCP/PPP lease connection records).  If a second abuse
   report comes in for 203.0.113.1, port 58204, the operator will
   determine that port 58204 is within the dynamic pool range, consult
   the log file, correlate with connection records, and determine that
   subscriber 2 generated the traffic (assuming that the public safety
   timestamp matches the operator timestamp.  As noted in RFC6292
   [RFC6292], accurate time-keeping (e.g., use of NTP or Simple NTP) is
   vital).

   In this example, there are no log entries for the majority of
   subscribers, who only use pre-allocated ports.  Only minimal logging
   would be needed for those few subscribers who exceed their pre-
   allocated ports and obtain extra bulk port assignments from the
   dynamic pool.  Logging data for those users will include inside
   address, outside address, outside port range, and timestamp.


3.  Additional Logging Considerations

   In order to be able to identify a subscriber based on observed
   external IPv4 address, port, and timestamp, an operator needs to know
   how the CGN was configured with regards to internal and external IP
   addresses, dynamic address pool factor, maximum ports per user, and
   reserved port range at any given time.  Therefore, the CGN MUST
   generate a log message any time such variables are changed.  Also,
   the CGN SHOULD generate such a log message once per day to facilitate
   quick identification of the relevant configuration in the event of an
   abuse notification.

   Such a log message MUST, at minimum, include the timestamp, inside
   prefix I, inside mask, outside prefix O, outside mask, D, M, A, and
   reserved port list; for example:

4.  Impact on the IPv6 Transition

   The solution described in this document is applicable to Carrier
   Grade NAT transition technologies (e.g.  NAT444, DS-Lite, and NAT64).
   As discussed in [I-D.donley-nat444-impacts], the authors acknowledge
   that native IPv6 will offer subscribers a better experience than CGN.
   However, many CPE devices only support IPv4.  Likewise, as of July
   2012, only approximately 4% of the top 1 million websites were
   available using IPv6.  Accordingly, deterministic CGN should in no
   way be understood as making CGN a replacement for IPv6 service.  The
   authors encourage device manufacturers to consider [RFC6540] and
   include IPv6 support.  In the interim, however, CGN has already been
   deployed in some ISP networks.  Deterministic CGN will provide ISPs
   with the ability to quickly respond to public safety requests without
   requiring excessive infrastructure, operations, and bandwidth to
   support per-connection logging.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations applicable to NAT operation for various
   protocols as documented in, for example, RFC 4787 [RFC4787] and RFC
   5382 [RFC5382] also apply to this document.
