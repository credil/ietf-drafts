Internet-Draft                One Way Delay                    July 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Packet One Way Delay Metrics Block

   [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-delay] defines the new block type
   supporting the reporting of the mean, minimum and maximum values of
   the network round-trip delay between media source(source) and media
   receiver(destination).  However none of these metrics allow a
   receiver to report one way delay from source to destination or the
   other way around.  As described in [RFC2679], the path from a source
   to a destination may be different than the path from the destination
   back to the source.  Even when the two paths are symmetric, they may
   have radically different performance characteristics.  Therefore the
   measurement of one-way delay can not be roughly estimated by the
   round-trip delay for many applications in the asymmetric network and
   even symmetric network.

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the mean, minimum, maximum values of one
   way network delay between RTP interfaces in peer RTP end systems, as
   measured, for example, using the method described in [RFC2679].

   This metrics belong to the class of transport metrics defined in
   [MONARCH].

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block.  The
   use of Extended Report blocks is defined by [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [MONARCH] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The Metrics Block described in this
   document are in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and
   [MONARCH].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to a range of delay-sensitive RTP
   applications in which this report block would be useful, such as some
   IDMS use cases (e.g., video wall, network games, networked
   loudspeakers, etc., see Draft IDMS [IDMS]).

3.2.  Definition of Fields in One Way Delay Metrics Report Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A One way Delay Report Block is identified by the constant OWD.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace OWD with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the One Way Metrics are
      Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics [MONARCH], that is,
      whether the reported values applies to the most recent measurement
      interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=10) (the
      Interval Duration), to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=11) (the Cumulative Duration) or is a
      sampled instantaneous value (I=01).

Internet-Draft                One Way Delay                    July 2012


   Reserved (resv): 6 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to zero by senders
      and MUST be ignored by receivers.


   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Delay block, the block length is equal to 4.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the media source shall be set to the value of the SSRC
      identifier carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of the RTP packet
      to which the XR relates.


   Median-One-way-Network-Delay: 32 bits

      The Mean One way Delay is the mean value of the RTP-to- RTP
      interface one way delay in units of 1/65536 seconds over the
      measurement period.  It can be calculated using RTCP SR/RR or RTP
      media packet according to section 3.6 of [RFC2679].  For details
      on one way delay calculation, see Section 5.


   Max-One-way-Network-Delay: 32 bits

      The Max One Way Delay is the maximum value of the RTP- to-RTP
      interface one way delay in units of 1/65536 seconds over the
      measurement period.  It can be calculated using RTCP SR/RR or RTP
      media packet according to section 3.6 of [RFC2679].  For details
      on one way delay calculation, see Section 5.


   Min-One-way-Network-Delay: 32 bits

      The Max One Way Delay is the minimum value of the RTP- to-RTP
      interface one way delay in units of 1/65536 seconds over the
      measurement period.  It can be calculated using RTCP SR/RR or RTP
      media packet according to section 3.6 of [RFC2679].  For details
      on one way delay calculation, see Section 5.

4.  Clock synchronization for one way delay metrics

   This subsection provides informative guidance on use of methodology
   for one way delay metrics measurement.

   As specified in the methodology of [RFC2679], it is important for
   media source (Src) and media receiver (Dst) to synchronize very
   closely since one way delay values will often be as low as the 100
   usec to 10 msec range.  In order to arrange Src and Des synchronized
   before measurement method is applied, a participant at the Dst can
   indicate which synchronization source is being used at the moment.  A
   participant can also indicate any other synchronization sources
   available to it.  This allows multiple participants in an RTP session
   to use the same or a similar clock synchronization source for their
   session.

6.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format =/ xr-one-way-delay-block

   xr-one-way-delay-block ="one way delay"

7.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

7.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value OWD in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "One Way Delay Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace OWD with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

7.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "one way delay" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

7.3.  Contact information for registrations


      The contact information for the registrations is:

8.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
