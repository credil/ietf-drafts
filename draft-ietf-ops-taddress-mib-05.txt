This document introduces a Management Information Base (MIB) module
that defines textual conventions to represent commonly used
transport-layer addressing information.  The definitions are
compatible with the concept of TAddress/TDomain pairs introduced by
the Structure of Management Information version 2 (SMIv2) and support
the Internet transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
