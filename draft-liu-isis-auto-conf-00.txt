Abstract

   This document describes mechanisms for IS-IS to be self-configuring.
   Such mechanisms could reduce the management burden to configure a
   network. One obvious environment that could benefit from these
   mechanisms is IPv6 home network where plug-and-play would be expected.
   Besides home network, some simple enterprise/ISP networks might also
   potentially benefit from the self-configuring mechanisms.

1. Introduction

   This memo describes mechanisms for IS-IS [RFC1195][RFC5308] to be
   auto-configuring. Such mechanisms could reduce the management burden
   to configure a network. One example is home network where plug-and-
   play would be expected. Besides home network, some simple
   enterprise/ISP networks might also potentially benefit from the auto-
   configuring mechanisms.

   The auto-configuring mechanisms are designed based on IPv6-only
   environment. Some IPv4 environments might also applicable, but they
   are not specifically considered.

   The following aspects of IS-IS auto-configuration are described:

   1. IS-IS Default Configuration

   2. IS-IS NET self-generation

   3. IS-IS Adjacency Formation

   However, this draft does not provide a completely configuration-free
   alternative to the IS-IS protocol, since some plan work by human so
   far is very difficult to be achieved through algorithm. The following
   features of IS-IS are not supported by this document:

   o Auto-configuring multiple IS-IS processes. The auto-configuration
   mechanisms only support configuring a single process.

   o Route between multiple IS-IS areas. The auto-configuration
   mechanisms only support routers that are within a single area.

   o Auto-configuring multiple operation levels. The auto-configuration
   mechanisms only support level-1 operation mode.

   o This document does not consider interoperability with other routing
   protocols.

2. IS-IS Default Configuration

   o IS-IS SHOULD be enabled on all interfaces in a router as default.
   For some specific situations, interface MAY be excluded if it is a
   clear that running IS-IS on the interface is not required.

   o IS-IS interfaces MUST be auto-configured to an interface type
   corresponding to their layer-2 capability. For example, Ethernet
   interfaces will be auto-configured as broadcast networks and Point-
   to-Point Protocol (PPP) interfaces will be auto-configured as Point-
   to-Point interfaces.

3. IS-IS NET Generation

   In IS-IS, a router (known as an IS) is identified by an Network
   Entity Title (NET) which is the address of a Network Service Access
   Point (NSAP) and represented with an IS-IS specific address format.
   The NSAP is a logical entity which represents an instance of the IS-
   IS protocol running on an IS.

   The NET consists of the following three parts:

   Area address: This field is 1 to 13 octets in length. In IS-IS auto-
   configuring, this field MUST be 0 in 13 octets length.

   System ID: This field follows the area address field, and is 6 octets
   in length. As specified in IS-IS protocol, this field must be unique
   among all level-1 routers in the same area when the IS operates at
   Level 1. In IS-IS auto-configuring, this field SHOULD be the MAC
   address of one IS-IS enabled interface.

   NSEL: This field is the N-selector, and is 1 octet in length. In IS-
   IS auto-configuring, tt must be set to "00".

4. IS-IS NET Duplication Detection and Resolution

   As described in Section 3, in IS-IS auto-configuring the NETs are
   distinguished by the System ID field in which it is a MAC address. So
   for IS-IS neighbors' NET duplication, it is equal to MAC address
   duplication in a LAN, which means a serious problem that devices
   would need to be changed. IS-IS auto-configuring does not consider
   this situation.

   For the non-neighbor NET duplication detection within an area, this
   document utilizes a TLV as following to do it.

4.1. Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV

   The Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV is defined in [OSPFv3AC]. This
   document re-uses it to achieve NET duplication detection.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

              Figure 1 Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV Format

   As defined in [OSPFv3AC], the contents of the hardware fingerprint
   should be some combination of CPU ID, or serial number(s) that
   provides an extremely high probability of uniqueness. It MUST be
   based on hardware attributes that will not change across hard and
   soft restarts. Note that, since the TLV is to detect MAC address
   based NET duplication, the TLV content MUST NOT use MAC address only
   again. Implementations SHOULD use other information exclude MAC
   address.

4.2. NET Duplication Detection and Resolution

   The Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV MUST be included in the first
   originated level-1 LSP by every auto-configuring routers. An IS-IS
   auto-configuring router MUST compare a received self-originated LSP's
   Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV against its own one. If the they are
   not equal, there is a NET duplication and the Router with the
   numerically smaller router hardware fingerprint MUST generate a new
   NET.

   After selecting a new NET, the LSP with the prior duplicate NET MUST
   be purged. And any IS-IS neighbor adjacencies MUST be reestablished.

5. Security Considerations

   TBD.

6. IANA Considerations

   The Router Hardware Fingerprint TLV type code needs an assignment.
