                      OAuth 2.0 Assertion Profile
                     draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-01

Abstract

   This specification provides a general framework for the use of
   assertions as client credentials and/or authorization grants with
   OAuth 2.0.  It includes a generic mechanism for transporting
   assertions during interactions with a token endpoint, as wells as
   rules for the content and processing of those assertions.  The intent
   is to provide an enhanced security profile by using derived values
   such as signatures or HMACs, as well as facilitate the use of OAuth
   2.0 in client-server integration scenarios where the end-user may not
   be present.

   This specification only defines abstract message flow and assertion
   content.  Actual use requires implementation of a companion protocol
   binding specification.  Additional profile documents provide standard
   representations in formats such as SAML and JWT.

2.  Overview

   The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2] provides a
   method for making authenticated HTTP requests to a resource using an
   access token.  Access tokens are issued to clients by an
   authorization server with the (sometimes implicit) approval of the
   resource owner.  These access tokens are typically obtained by
   exchanging an authorization grant representing authorization by the
   resource owner or privileged administrator.  Several authorization
   grant types are defined to support a wide range of client types and
   user experiences.  OAuth also allows for the definition of new
   extension grant types to support additional clients or to provide a
   bridge between OAuth and other trust frameworks.  Finally, OAuth
   allows the definition of additional authentication mechanisms to be
   used by clients when interacting with the authorization server.

   In scenarios where security is at a premium one wants to avoid
   sending secrets across the Internet, even on encrypted connections.
   Instead one wants to send values derived from the secret that prove
   to the receiver that the sender is in possession of the secret
   without actually sending the secret.  Typically the way derived
   values are created is by generating an assertion that is then either
   HMAC'ed or digitally signed using an agreed upon secret.  By
   validating the HMAC or digital signature on the assertion, the
   receiver can prove to themselves that the entity that generated the
   assertion was in possession of the secret without actually
   communicating the secret directly.

   This specification provides a general framework for the use of
   assertions as client credentials and/or authorization grants with
   OAuth 2.0.  It includes a generic mechanism for transporting
   assertions during interactions with a token endpoint, as wells as
   rules for the content and processing of those assertions.  The intent
   is to provide an enhanced security profile by using derived values
   such as signatures or HMACs, as well as facilitate the use of OAuth
   2.0 in client-server integration scenarios where the end-user may not
   be present.

   This specification only defines abstract message flow and assertion
   content.  Actual use requires implementation of a companion protocol
   binding specification.  Additional profile documents provide standard
   representations in formats such as SAML and JWT.


3.  Authentication vs. Authorization

   This specification provides a model for using assertions for
   authentication of an OAuth client during interactions with an
   Authorization Server, as well as the use of assertions as
   authorization grants.  It is important to note that the use of
   assertions for client authentication is orthogonal and separable from
   using assertions as an authorization grant and can be used either in
   combination or in isolation.  In addition, in scenarios when
   assertion based authentication and authorization are used in
   combination, the assertion format and processing may be redundant;
   under such circumstances, the protocol may be optimized to present a
   single assertion.


4.  Transporting Assertions

   This section defines generic HTTP parameters for transporting
   assertions during interactions with a token endpoint.

4.1.  Using Assertions for Client Authentication

   In scenarios where one wants to avoid sending secrets, one wants to
   send values derived from the secret that prove to the receiver that
   the sender is in possession of the secret without actually sending
   the secret.

   For example, a client can establish a secret using an out-of-band
   mechanism with a resource server.  As part of this out-of-band
   communication the client and resource server agree that the client
   will authenticate itself using an assertion with agreed upon
   parameters that will be signed by the provisioned secret.  Later on,
   the client might send an access token request to the token endpoint
   for the resource server that includes an authorization code, as well
   as a client_assertion that is signed with the previously agreed key
   and parameters.  The client_assertion proves to the token endpoint
   the identity of the client and the authorization code provides the
   link to the end-user authorization.

   The following section defines the use of assertions as client
   credentials as an extension of Section 3.2 of OAuth 2.0
   [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  When using assertions as client credentials,

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-01         October 2011


   the client MUST include the assertion using the following HTTP
   request parameters:

   client_id  OPTIONAL.  The client identifier as described in Section 3
      of OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

   client_assertion_type  REQUIRED.  The format of the assertion as
      defined by the authorization server.  The value MUST be an
      absolute URI.

   client_assertion  REQUIRED.  The assertion being used to authenticate
      the client.  Specific serialization of the assertion is defined by
      profile documents.  The serialization MUST be encoded for
      transport within HTTP forms.  It is RECOMMENDED that base64url be
      used.

   The following non-normative example demonstrates a client
   authenticating using an assertion during an Authorization Code Access
   Token Request as defined in Section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0
   [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2]. (line breaks are for display purposes only):
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
code=i1WsRn1uB1&
client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
client_assertion_type=urn%3Aoasis%3Anames%sAtc%3ASAML%3A2.0%3Aassertion&
client_assertion=PHNhbWxwOl...[omitted for brevity]...ZT

   The client MUST NOT include the client_credential using more than one
   mechanism.  Token endpoints can differentiate between client
   assertion credentials and other client credential types by looking
   for the presence of the client_assertion and client_assertion_type
   attributes which will only be present with client assertion
   credentials.  See section 7 for more details

4.2.  Using Assertions as Authorization Grants

   An assertion can be used to request an access token when a client
   wishes to utilize an existing trust relationship.  This may be done
   through the semantics of (and a digital signature/HMAC calculated
   over) the assertion, and expressed to the authorization server
   through an extension authorization grant type.  The processes by
   which authorization is previously granted, and by which the client
   obtains the assertion prior to exchanging it with the authorization
   server, are out of scope.

   The following defines the use of assertions as authorization grants
   as an extension of OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2], section 4.5.  When
   using assertions as authorization grants, the client MUST include the
   assertion using the following HTTP request parameters:

   client_id  OPTIONAL.  The client identifier as described in Section 3
      of OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

   grant_type  REQUIRED.  The format of the assertion as defined by the
      authorization server.  The value MUST be an absolute URI.

   assertion  REQUIRED.  The assertion being used as an authorization
      grant.  Specific serialization of the assertion is defined by
      profile documents.  The serialization MUST be encoded for
      transport within HTTP forms.  It is RECOMMENDED that base64url be
      used.

   scope  OPTIONAL.  The request MAY contain a "scope" parameter.  The
      scope of the access request is expressed as a list of space-
      delimited strings.  The value is defined by the authorization
      server.  If the value contains multiple space- delimited strings,
      their order does not matter, and each string adds an additional
      access range to the requested scope.  When exchanging assertions
      for access_tokens, the authorization for the token has been
      previously granted through some other mechanism.  As such, the
      requested scope SHOULD be equal or lesser than the scope
      originally granted to the authorized accessor.  If the scope
      parameter and/or value is omitted, the scope SHOULD be treated as
      equal to the scope originally granted to the authorized accessor.
      The Authorization Server SHOULD limit the scope of the issued
      access token to be equal or lesser than the scope originally
      granted to the authorized accessor.

   The following non-normative example demonstrates an assertion being
   used as an authorization grant. (line breaks are for display purposes
   only):
   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
   grant_type=urn%3Aoasis%3Anames%sAtc%3ASAML%3A2.0%3Aassertion&
   assertion=PHNhbWxwOl...[omitted for brevity]...ZT4


5.  Assertion Content and Processing

   This section provides a general content and processing model for the

   use of assertions in OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

5.1.  Assertion Metamodel

   The following are entities and metadata involved in the issuance,
   exchange and processing of assertions in OAuth 2.0.  These are
   general terms, abstract from any particular assertion format.
   Mappings of these terms into specific representations are provided by
   profiles of this specification.

   Issuer  The unique identifier for the entity that issued the
      assertion.  Generally this is the entity that holds the keying
      material used to generate the assertion.  In some use-cases
      Issuers may be either OAuth Clients (when assertions are self-
      asserted ) or a Security Token Service (an entity capable of
      issuing, renewing, transforming and validating of security
      tokens).

   Principal  A unique identifier for the subject of the assertion.
      When using assertions for client authentication, the Principal
      SHOULD be the client_id of the OAuth client.  When using
      assertions as an authorization grant, the Principal MUST identify
      an authorized accessor for whom the access token is being
      requested (typically the resource owner, or an authorized
      delegate).

   Audience  A URI that identifies the party intended to process the
      assertion.  The audience SHOULD be the URL of the Token Endpoint
      as defined in section 2.2 of OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

   Issued At   The time at which the assertion was issued.  While the
      serialization may differ by assertion format, this is always
      expressed in UTC with no time zone component.

   Expires At   The time at which the assertion expires.  While the
      serialization may differ by assertion format, this is always
      expressed in UTC with no time zone component.

   Assertion ID  A nonce or unique identifier for the assertion.  The
      Assertion ID may be used by implementations requiring message de-
      duplication for one-time use assertions.  Any entity that assigns
      an identifier MUST ensure that there is negligible probability
      that that entity or any other entity will accidentally assign the
      same identifier to a different data object.

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-01         October 2011


5.2.  General Assertion Format and Processing Rules

   The following are general format and processing rules for the use of
   assertions in OAuth:

   o  The assertion MUST contain an Issuer.  The Issuer MUST identify
      the entity that issued the assertion as recognized by the
      Authorization Server.  If an assertion is self-asserted, the
      Issuer SHOULD be the client_id.

   o  The assertion SHOULD contain a Principal.  The Principal MUST
      identify an authorized accessor for whom the access token is being
      requested ( typically the resource owner, or an authorized
      delegate ) When the client is acting on behalf of itself, the
      Principal SHOULD be the client_id.

   o  The assertion MUST contain an Audience that identifies the
      Authorization Server as the intended audience.  The Authorization
      Server MUST verify that it is an intended audience for the
      assertion.  The Audience SHOULD be the URL of the Authorization
      Server's Token Endpoint.

   o  The assertion MUST contain an Expires At entity that limits the
      time window during which the assertion can be used.  The
      authorization server MUST verify that the expiration time has not
      passed, subject to allowable clock skew between systems.  The
      authorization server SHOULD reject assertions with an Expires At
      attribute value that is unreasonably far in the future.

   o  The assertion MAY contain an Issued At entity containing the UTC
      time at which the assertion was issued.

   o  The assertion MAY contain an Assertion ID.  An Authorization
      Server MAY dictate that Assertion ID is mandatory.

   o  The Authorization Server MUST validate the assertion in order to
      establish a mapping between the Issuer and the secret used to
      generate the assertion.  The algorithm used to validate the
      assertion, and the mechanism for designating the secret used to
      generate the assertion is out-of-scope for this specification.


6.  Specific Assertion Format and Processing Rules

   The following clarifies the format and processing rules defined in
   section 4 and section 5 for a number of common use-cases:

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-01         October 2011


6.1.  Client authentication

   When a client authenticates to a token service using an assertion, it
   SHOULD do so according to section 4.1.  The following format and
   processing rules SHOULD be applied:

   o  The client_id HTTP parameter SHOULD identify the client to the
      authorization server.

   o  The client_assertion_type HTTP parameter MUST identify the
      assertion format being used for authentication.

   o  The client_assertion HTTP parameter MUST contain the serialized
      assertion in a format indicated by the client_assertion_type
      parameter.

   o  The Issuer of the assertion MUST identify the entity that issued
      the assertion as recognized by the Authorization Server.  If the
      assertion is self-asserted, the Issuer SHOULD be the client_id.

   o  The Principal MUST identify an authorized accessor.  If the
      assertion is self-issued, the Principal SHOULD be the client_id.

   o  The Audience of the assertion MUST identify the Authorization
      Server and SHOULD be the URL of the Token Endpoint.

   o  The Authorization Server MUST validate the assertion in order to
      establish a mapping between the Issuer and the secret used to
      generate the assertion.

   The following non-normative example demonstrates the use of a client
   authentication using an assertion during an Authorization Code Access
   Token Request as defined in Section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0
   [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2]. (line breaks are for display purposes only):
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
code=i1WsRn1uB1&
client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
client_assertion_type=urn%3Aoasis%3Anames%sAtc%3ASAML%3A2.0%3Aassertion&
client_assertion=PHNhbWxwOl...[omitted for brevity]...ZT4

6.2.  Client acting on behalf of itself

   When a client is accessing resources on behalf of itself, it SHOULD
   do so in a manner analogous to the Client Credentials flow defined in



Mortimore, et al.          Expires May 3, 2012                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-01         October 2011


   Section 4.4 of OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  This is a special case
   that combines both the authentication and authorization grant usage
   patterns.  In this case, the interactions with the authorization
   server SHOULD be treated as using an assertion for Client
   Authentication according to section 4.1, with the addition of a
   grant_type parameter.  The following format and processing rules
   SHOULD be applied.

   o  The client_id HTTP parameter SHOULD identify the client to the
      authorization server.

   o  The grant_type HTTP request parameter MUST be
      "client_credentials".

   o  The client_assertion_type HTTP parameter MUST identify the
      assertion format.

   o  The client_assertion HTTP parameter MUST contain the serialized
      assertion as in a format indicated by the client_assertion_type
      parameter.

   o  The Issuer of the assertion MUST identify the entity that issued
      the assertion as recognized by the Authorization Server.  If the
      assertion is self-asserted, the Issuer SHOULD be the client_id.
      If the assertion was issued by a Security Token Service, the
      Issuer SHOULD identify the STS as recognized by the Authorization
      Server.

   o  The Principal SHOULD be the client_id.

   o  The Audience of the assertion MUST identify the Authorization
      Server and SHOULD be the URL of the Token Endpoint.

   o  The Authorization Server MUST validate the assertion in order to
      establish a mapping between the Issuer and the secret used to
      generate the assertion.

   The following non-normative example demonstrates the use of a sample
   assertion being used for a Client Credentials Access Token Request as
   defined in Section 4.4.2 of OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2]. (line
   breaks are for display purposes only):

6.3.  Client acting on behalf of a user

   When a client is accessing resources on behalf of a user, it SHOULD
   be treated as using an assertion as an Authorization Grant according
   to section 4.2.  The following format and processing rules SHOULD be
   applied:

   o  The client_id HTTP parameter MUST identify the client to the
      authorization server.

   o  The grant_type HTTP request parameter MUST indicate the assertion
      format.

   o  The assertion HTTP parameter MUST contain the serialized assertion
      as in a format indicated by the grant_type parameter.

   o  The Issuer of the assertion MUST identify the entity that issued
      the assertion as recognized by the Authorization Server.  If the
      assertion is self-asserted, the Issuer SHOULD be the client_id.
      If the assertion was issued by a STS, the Issuer SHOULD identify
      the STS as recognized by the Authorization Server.

   o  The Principal MUST identify an authorized accessor for whom the
      access token is being requested (typically the resource owner, or
      an authorized delegate).

   o  The Audience of the assertion MUST identify the Authorization
      Server and MAY be the URL of the Token Endpoint.

   o  The Authorization Server MUST validate the assertion in order to
      establish a mapping between the Issuer and the secret used to
      generate the assertion.

   The following non-normative example demonstrates the use of a client
   authenticating using an assertion during an Authorization Code Access
   Token Request as defined in Section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0
   [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2]. (line breaks are for display purposes only):

   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&

6.4.  Client acting on behalf of an anonymous user

   When a client is accessing resources on behalf of an anonymous user,
   the following format and processing rules SHOULD be applied:

   o  The client_id HTTP parameter MUST identify the client to the
      authorization server.

   o  The grant_type HTTP request parameter MUST indicate the assertion
      format.

   o  The assertion HTTP parameter MUST contain the serialized assertion
      as in a format indicated by the grant_type parameter.

   o  The Issuer of the assertion MUST identify the entity that issued
      the assertion as recognized by the Authorization Server.  If the
      assertion is self-asserted, the Issuer SHOULD be the client_id.
      If the assertion was issued by a Security Token Service, the
      Issuer SHOULD identify the STS as recognized by the Authorization
      Server.

   o  The Principal SHOULD indicate to the Authorization Server that the
      client is acting on-behalf of an anonymous user as defined by the
      Authorization Server.  It is implied that authorization is based
      upon additional criteria, such as additional attributes or claims
      provided in the assertion.  For example, a client may present an
      assertion from a trusted issuer asserting that the bearer is over
      18 via an included claim.  In this case, no additional information
      about the user's identity is included yet all the data needed to
      issue an access token is present.

   o  The Audience of the assertion MUST identify the Authorization
      Server and MAY be the URL of the Token Endpoint.

   o  The Authorization Server MUST validate the assertion in order to
      establish a mapping between the Issuer and the secret used to
      generate the assertion.

7.  Error Responses

   If an assertion is not valid or has expired, the Authorization Server
   MUST construct an error response as defined in OAuth 2.0
   [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  The value of the error parameter MUST be the
   "invalid_grant" error code.  The authorization server MAY include
   additional information regarding the reasons the assertion was
   considered invalid using the "error_description" or "error_uri"
   parameters.

   For example:
   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
   "error":"invalid_grant",
   "error_description":"Audience validation failed"
   }

   A client MUST NOT include client credentials using more than one
   mechanism.  Token endpoints can differentiate between assertion based
   credentials and other client credential types by looking for the
   presence of the client_assertion and client_assertion_type attributes
   which will only be present when using assertions for client
   authentication.  If more than one mechanism is used, the
   Authorization Server MUST construct an error response as defined in
   OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  The value of the error parameter MUST
   be the "invalid_client" error code.  The authorization server MAY
   include additional information regarding the reasons the client was
   considered invalid using the "error_description" or "error_uri"
   parameters.

   For example:
   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
   "error":"invalid_client"
   "error_description":"Multiple Credentials Not Allowed"
   }


8.  Security Considerations

   Authorization Providers concerned with preventing replay attacks may
   choose to implement using replay detection using a combination of the

Internet-Draft       draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-01         October 2011


   AssertionID and IssuedAt/ExpiredAt attributes.  Previously processed
   assertions MAY be de-duped and rejected based on the AssertionID.
   The addition of the validity window relieves the authorization server
   from maintaining an infinite state table of processed assertion IDs.

   Authorization Servers SHOULD consider the amount of information
   exposed in error responses, and the risk associated with exposing
   details of specific processing errors.  In addition, Authorization
   Servers SHOULD prevent timing attacks related to cryptographic
   processing of the assertion.

   No additional considerations beyond those described within the OAuth
   2.0 Protocol Framework, Section 10 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].
