This memo specifies an Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) based
one-time password generation mechanism for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) Digest access authentication.  The HTTP Authentication
Framework includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both
schemes employ a shared secret based mechanism for access
authentication.  The AKA mechanism performs user authentication and
session key distribution in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS) networks.  AKA is a challenge-response based mechanism that
uses symmetric cryptography.

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.
