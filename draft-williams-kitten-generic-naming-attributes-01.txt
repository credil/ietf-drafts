Generic Naming Attributes for the Generic Security Services Application
                    Programming Interface (GSS-API)
           draft-williams-kitten-generic-naming-attributes-01

Abstract

   This document specifies several useful generic naming attributes for
   use with the Generic Security Services Application Programming
   Interface (GSS-API) Naming Extensions specified in RFC6680.

   These attributes allow applications to extract discrete components of
   a GSS-API "mechanism name" (MN) object: issuer (e.g., realm name,
   domain name, certification authority name), service and host names
   (for host-based service names), user names, and others.

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   The Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-
   API) [RFC2743] allows applications -and application protocol
   specifications- to use various security mechanisms in a generic way.
   There are some shortcomings of this API that preclude a fully-generic
   treatment of security mechanisms.  This document builds on the naming
   extensions to the GSS-API [RFC6680] to correct some of those
   shortcomings.

   In RFC6680 we introduced an interface by which to access "attributes"
   of names, but we did not specify any attributes.  This document
   specifies some such attributes.  Some of the new attributes are
   specifically intended to make it possible to use the GSS-API in a
   mechanism-generic way in common use cases where it is otherwise not
   possible to do so.

   For example, some applications need to be able to observe the
   discrete elements of a peer principal's host-based service name, but
   they generally could only do so by parsing mechanism-specific display
   syntaxes or exported name token formats.  Such applications are
   inherently not generic: they can only function correctly when used
   with security mechanism whose principal naming conventions/formats
   the applications understand.

   More generally, we use the the extended naming interface to introduce
   an attribute model of principal naming.

1.1.  Naming Constraints

   This document also introduces a notion of naming constraints, not
   unlike PKIX's [RFC5280].  Naming constraints apply to "issuers" of
   principal names and/or their attributes.  For example, to Kerberos
   [RFC4120] realms, to PKIX certification authorities, to identity
   providers (IdPs), and so on.  The goal is allow specification of
   policies which constrain the set of principal names that a given
   issuer can issue credentials for.

   For example, the Kerberos realm FOO.EXAMPLE would generally not be
   expected to issue credentials to host-based principals in domains
   other than "foo.example".

   For each concrete attribute specified below there are several ways to
   inquire a NAME's value for that attribute:

   1.  with naming constraint checking, providing no output if naming
       constraints are violated;

Internet-Draft                 Simple GSS                    August 2013


   2.  with naming constraint checking, providing an output indicator of
       naming constraint violations;

   3.  without naming constraint checking;

   4.  any of the above with "fast" (no slow I/O involved) naming
       constraint checking.

   (1) is the default behavior.  The others are obtained by adding an
   appropriate prefix to the attribute name.

   Existing security mechanisms may not have any formal notion of naming
   constraints, but it is common to have some naming constraint
   conventions nonetheless.  For example, Kerberos realm naming
   conventions are that realm names should mirror Domain Name System
   (DNS) [RFC1035] domain names, and that hostnames embedded in Kerberos
   principal names should a) be fully-qualified, b) within the domain
   corresponding to the DNS domain name derived from the realm's name.
   Or a Kerberos implementation might lookup a host's realm and check
   that it matches the principal's realm.  Naming constraints should be
   formalized for all GSS-API security mechanisms.

1.2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Generic Attributes

   We add a number of generic name attributes, to be used via the GSS-
   API extended naming facility [RFC6680].  Some of these attributes can
   be used as prefixes of other attributes, that is, they can be used to
   modify the semantics of other attributes (see section 6 of RFC6680).

   Note: in all cases the display form of each attribute SHALL consist
   of text using the character set, codeset, and encoding from the
   caller's locale.

2.1.  Concrete Attributes

   These attributes generally have a single value each.  Only one of
   these attributes can also be used a prefix: the issuer name
   attribute.

2.1.1.  Issuer Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain a name of an issuer of a
   mechanism name (MN) or of an attribute of an MN.  The API name for
   this attribute is GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_ISSUERNAME, and it's actual
   attribute name is "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-issuername".

   The display form of issuer names is mechanism-specific.

   The non-display form of issuer names SHALL be the exported name token
   form of the issuer's name.  Not all mechanisms will support issuer
   names as MNs, therefore implementations MAY output a null non-display
   value.

   For example, for the Kerberos mechanism [RFC4121] an issuer name
   would generally (but not always!) be a Kerberos realm name, probably
   displayed as just the realm name.  (But note that there is not yet a
   Kerberos realm name as MN specification.  We will specify one
   separately.)

   This attribute can be used as prefix of other attributes.  When used
   as a prefix, this attribute indicates that the application wishes to
   know the name of the issuer of the prefixed attribute of the given
   MN.

2.1.2.  User Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain the component of an MN naming
   a user.  The API name for this attribute is
   GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_USERNAME, and it's actual attribute name is
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-username".

Internet-Draft                 Simple GSS                    August 2013


   The display form of user names is mechanism-specific.

   The non-display form of user names is mechanism-specific.

2.1.3.  Service Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain the component of an MN naming
   a service as part of a host- or domain-based service name.  The API
   name for this attribute is GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_SERVICENAME, and it's
   actual attribute name is
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-servicename".

   The non-display form of the service name SHALL be the UTF-8 encoding
   of the service name.

2.1.4.  Host Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain the component of an MN naming
   a host as part of a host- or domain-based service name.  The API name
   for this attribute is GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_HOSTNAME, and it's actual
   attribute name is "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-hostname".

   The display form of a host name MAY be stylized and SHOULD NOT be
   A-labels.  [RFC5890].

   The non-display form of host names SHOULD be a character string as
   described in [RFC1123], and SHOULD NOT be U-labels [RFC5890].

2.1.5.  Domain Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain the component of an MN naming
   a domain as part of a domain-based service name.  The API name for
   this attribute is GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_DOMAINNAME, and it's actual
   attribute name is "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-domainname".

   The display form of a domain name MAY be stylized and SHOULD NOT be
   A-labels.  [RFC5890].

   The non-display form of domain names SHOULD be a character string as
   described in [RFC1123], and SHOULD NOT be U-labels [RFC5890].

2.2.  Prefix Attributes

   GSS_Get_name_attribute() using attributes described in the preceding
   section SHALL fail if there are any name constraints that can be
   applied to the issuers of those names and, in applying those
   constraints, it is discovered that the issuer was not permitted to
   issue credentials for the MN.

Internet-Draft                 Simple GSS                    August 2013


   For example, a Kerberos realm named "FOO.EXAMPLE" might not be
   expected to issue credentials (tickets, keys) to host-based service
   names for hosts not ending in ".foo.example" or which are not
   "foo.example".

   Several generic attribute prefixes are described below for overriding
   this behavior.

2.2.1.  GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_UNCONSTRAINED

   This attribute prefix, named GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_UNCONSTRAINED in the
   API, and with an actual name of
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-gen-unconstrained", indicates
   that the application wants the value of the prefixed attribute
   without any name constraint checking.

2.2.2.  GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_UNCONSTRAINED_OK

   This attribute prefix, named GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_UNCONSTRAINED_OK in
   the API, and with an actual name of
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-gen-unconstrained-ok",
   indicates that the application wants the value of the prefixed
   attribute regardless of any applicable naming constraints, but to
   indicate the name constraint status via the 'authenticated' output
   parameter of the GSS_Get_name_attribute() interface.

2.2.3.  GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_FAST

   This attribute prefix, named GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_FAST in the API, and
   with an actual name of
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-gen-fast", indicates that the
   application requires that the mechanism not perform any slow
   operations (e.g., connecting to a directory for the purposes of name
   constraint validation) in obtaining the prefixed attribute of the
   given MN.

3.  Local Name Attributes

   Normally an Internet specification would not be expected to specify
   any local name attributes of GSS names.  However, there is one common
   and very useful local name attribute, which we specify below.
   Implementations are free to use different names for this attribute or
   exclude it altogether -- it is a local name attribute, after all.

3.1.  GSS_C_ATTR_LOCAL_LOGIN_USER

   This attribute, with suggested API symbolic name
   GSS_C_ATTR_LOCAL_LOGIN_USER, and suggested actual name "local-login-
   user", requests a local user name corresponding to the given MN, if
   any.

   Obtaining the local user name corresponding to an MN may require
   complex name mapping or lookup operations that are completely
   implementation-defined.
