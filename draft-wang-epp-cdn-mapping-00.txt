1. Introduction

   Many Chinese characters in common use have variants in Simplified
   Chinese (SC) form, Traditional Chinese (TC) form or other variant
   forms.  For example, the Chinese character "U+5B81" has 5 variants:
   "U+5B81" (SC form), "U+5BE7" (TC form), "U+21A34", "U+5BDC" and
   "U+5BCD" (other variant forms).  For Chinese users, the variants of a
   Chinese character in SC form, TC form and other variant forms are
   regarded as the same.

   To simplify the EPP implementations with support for CDN, Chinese
   Domain Names (CDNs) containing different variant forms (SC form, TC
   form, and other variant forms) are regarded as separated ones in this
   extension, whereas the association between variant forms are ensured
   by registration management which is out of scope of this
   specification.

   In order to meet above requirements of the CDNs registration, this
   document describes an extension of the Extensible Provisioning
   Protocol (EPP) domain name mapping [RFC5731] for the provisioning and
   management of CDNs.  This document is specified using the Extensible
   Markup Language (XML) 1.0 as described in [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] and
   XML Schema notation as described in [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028]
   and [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].

   The EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730] provides a complete
   description of EPP command and response structures.  A thorough
   understanding of the base protocol specification is necessary to
   understand the extension of mapping described in this document.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "conac-cdn-1.0" in this document is used as an abbreviation for
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conac-cdn-1.0.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this specification.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

3. Object Attributes

   This extension defines one additional element to the EPP domain name
   mapping [RFC5731]. It can be got from <domain:info> command.

   The CDN Unicode domain name is a domain name in Unicode which is
   converted from the corresponding CDNpunycode. In this document, its
   corresponding element is <cdn:CDNUnicode>.

4. EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730]. The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in provisioning and
   managing CDNs via EPP.

4.1. EPP Query Commands

   EPP provides three commands to retrieve domain information: <check>
   to determine if a domain object can be provisioned within a
   repository, <info> to retrieve detailed information associated with a
   domain object, and <transfer> to retrieve domain-object transfer
   status information.

4.1.1. EPP<check> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <check> command or
   <check> response described in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731].
   When a domain name has not been registered, but the domain which the

   user submitted for check is in the CDN list of a registered domain
   name, <check> response must contain explanation in the reason field
   to tell the user that this domain name is a CDN of a registered
   domain name, and can be activitated by the registrant by <create>
   command.

4.1.2. EPP<info> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <info> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].  However, additional
   elements are defined for the <info> response.

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <info> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].  However, additional
   elements are defined for the <info> response. When an <info> command
   has been processed successfully, the EPP <resData> element MUST
   contain child elements as described in the EPP domain mapping
   [RFC5731].  In addition, the EPP <extension> element SHOULD contain a
   child <cdn:infData> element that identifies the extension namespace
   if the domain object has data associated with this extension and
   based on server policy.  The <cdn:infData> element contains one child
   element:

   o  An OPTIONAL <cdn:CDNUnicode> element that contains the Unicode of
   the CDN.

   Example <info> Response for an authorized client:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>
   S:    <result code="1000">
   S:      <msg>Command completed successfully</msg>
   S:    </result>
   S:    <resData>
   S:      <domain:infData

   <info> Response for the unauthorized client has not been changed,see
   [RFC5731] for detail.

   An EPP error response MUST be returned if an <info> command cannot be
   processed for any reason.

4.1.3. EPP<transfer> Query Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <transfer> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].

4.2. EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform domain objects: <create> to
   create an instance of a domain object, <delete> to delete an instance
   of a domain object, <renew> to extend the validity period of a domain
   object, <transfer> to manage domain object sponsorship changes, and
   <update> to change information associated with a domain object.

4.2.1. EPP<create> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <create>
   command described in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731] for CDN
   registration.

4.2.2. EPP<delete> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <delete> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].

4.2.3. EPP<renew> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <renew> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].

4.2.4. EPP<transfer> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <transfer> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].

4.2.5. EPP<update> Command

   This extension does not add any element to the EPP <update> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731].

5. Formal Syntax

   An EPP object name mapping extension for CDN is specified in XML
   schema notation.  The formal syntax presented here is a complete
   schema representation of the object mapping suitable for automated
   validation of EPP XML instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part
   of the schema; they are used to note the beginning and ending of the
   schema for URI registration purposes.

   BEGIN

6. Internationalization Considerations

   EPP is represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding
   information using the Unicode character set and its more compact
   representations including UTF-8.  Conformant XML processors recognize
   both UTF-8 and UTF-16.  Though XML includes provisions to identify
   and use other character encodings through use of an "encoding"
   attribute in an <?xml?> declaration, use of UTF-8 is RECOMMENDED.

   As an extension of the EPP domain name mapping, the elements, element
   content described in this document MUST inherit the
   internationalization conventions used to represent higher-layer
   domain and core protocol structures present in an XML instance that
   includes this extension.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].  IANA is
   requested to assignment the following two URI.

   Registration request for the CDN namespace:

   o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:conac-cdn-1.0

   o  Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
   document.

   o  XML: None.  Namespace URI does not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the CDN XML schema:

   o  URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema: conac-cdn-1.0

   o  Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
   document.

   o  XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

8. Security considerations

   The object mapping extension described in this document does not
   provide any other security services or introduce any additional
   considerations beyond those described by [RFC5730] or those caused by
   the protocol layers used by EPP.
