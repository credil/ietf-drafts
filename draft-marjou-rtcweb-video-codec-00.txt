Abstract

   In the context of WebRTC, there is currently no consensus on the
   video codec(s) that need to be mandatory to implement.  This draft
   gives some arguments in favor of H.264.

Internet-Draft           Video codec for WebRTC             October 2012


1.  Introduction

   In the context of WebRTC, there is currently no consensus on the
   video codec(s) that need to be mandatory to implement.

   In order to reach a consensus, the RTCWEB chairs have solicited
   internet-drafts naming proposed mandatory-to-implement video codecs
   (c.f. [rtcweb-mail]).

   This draft gives some arguments in favor of H.264.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Rationale and Position

   Many videoconferencing systems exist today (e.g. fact sheets of
   services at [h264-ftob]), mainly for professional services but also
   for individual consumers.

   We believe that WebRTC, when used as a mean to interconnect Web
   browsers to these existing services, can be a driver for enabling
   more users to access them.

   As an example, all Orange video conferencing systems operate using
   the H.264/AVC technology.  H.264/AVC benefits from many available
   implementations, tuned for different architectures, and has clear
   licensing conditions.  VP8 has no footprint in this market,
   independent implementations are rare, licensing conditions are not
   yet clarified (free license offered from one patent owner while MPEG
   LA operates a Patent Pool with at least 12 members (c.f.
   [press-article])).

   With this current status, it is believed that incorporating the
   mandatory to implement video codec having the bigger footprint will
   permit a better adoption and interconnection of WebRTC to existing
   services leading to a successful standard.

   Hence we strongly support H.264/AVC to be part of the mandatory to
   implement codecs.
