Internet-Draft              Signal 3D format                October 2012


1.  Introduction

   In stereoscopic 3D multimedia applications, two views are displayed,
   one for the left eye and one for the right eye.

   There are various ways of formatting the views of Stereoscopic 3D
   video.  Examples of 3D formats are frame packing (see [HDMIv1.4a] and
   [ISO/IEC 14496-10]) and the combination of 2D video and auxiliary
   data such as depth maps or parallax maps (for both, see [ISO/IEC
   23002-3]).  Stereoscopic 3D video may be carried over a single stream
   or over several streams, depending on its 3D format.

   In multimedia streaming applications, the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] can be used to provide to the receiver
   sufficient information about the media streams, and to enable the
   receiver to join and participate in the session.

   This document defines an extension to SDP that provides sufficient
   information about the format of stereoscopic 3D video carried in the
   media stream(s).  Before accessing the stream(s), the receiver can
   use the 3D format description from SDP to determine whether it has
   the capability to receive and render the stereoscopic 3D video
   content, and whether it can participate in the session.

   The mentioned SDP extension is a new SDP attribute "3dFormat", which
   provides the format description of stereoscopic 3D video.  The design
   of the attribute is based on the following requirements, which are
   listed only for informational purposes:

   o  It MUST be possible to signal that the left and right views are
      carried in a single stream, by the use of frame packing.

   o  It MUST be possible to signal that 2D video and auxiliary video
      (such as depth maps) are carried in a single stream.

   o  It MUST be possible to signal that the left and right views are
      carried in two separate streams.

   o  It MUST be possible to signal that 2D video and auxiliary video
      (such as depth maps) are carried in separate streams.

   To bind multiple video streams that carry a single stereoscopic 3D
   video, this document also extends the SDP grouping mechanism from
   [RFC5888].

3.  Definitions

   2D video
      Video that does not in itself contain depth or parallax
      information.

   auxiliary video
      A sequence of depth or parallax maps, which are used to add depth
      to 2D video.

   C-view
      The centre view: a visual entity as seen from a viewpoint between
      the left and right eyes.  The C-view can be used to calculate the
      L- and R-views.

   C-stream
      A 2D video stream consisting of a sequence of C-views.

   depth map
      A two dimensional map, each pixel of which defines the depth of
      one or more pixels in an associated 2D video frame.

   depth map stream
      An auxiliary stream, which contains a sequence of depth maps.  The
      depth map stream is synchronised with the associated 2D video
      stream.

   frame packing
      A format that packs the L- and R-views into a single 2D video
      stream.  The packing may be done spatially, where each video frame
      is divided into sub-frames, one containing the L-view and one
      containing the R-view.  The packing can also be done sequentially,
      where alternating video frames represent L- and R-views.

   legacy answerer
      An answerer (in the SDP offer/answer model [RFC3264]) that does
      not support the "3dFormat" attribute.  The legacy answerer can be
      the streaming server or the streaming client, but is not compliant
      to this document.

   L-view
      A visual entity that is to be projected to the left eye.

   L-stream
      A 2D video stream consisting of a sequence of L-views.

   parallax map
      A two dimensional map, each pixel of which defines the parallax of
      one or more pixels in an associated 2D video frame.

   parallax map stream
      An auxiliary stream, which contains a sequence of parallax maps.
      The parallax map stream is synchronised with the associated 2D
      video stream.

   R-view
      A visual entity that is to be projected to the right eye.

   R-stream
      A 2D video stream consisting of a sequence of R-views.

   stereoscopic 3D video
      The L- and R-streams, ready to be projected to the viewer's left
      and right eyes.

   sub-frame
      A part of a video frame.

4.  The "3dFormat" attribute

   The media-level SDP attribute "3dFormat" signals the format of
   stereoscopic 3D video.  The attribute transfers this information
   through two parameters: one indicating the format type of the
   stereoscopic 3D video carried in the media stream(s), and the other
   indicating the type of the video component, which is a constituent
   element of the stereoscopic 3D video.  The video component type
   depends on the format type of the stereoscopic 3D video.  The syntax
   of the attribute is defined as follows:

                 a=3dFormat:<Format Type> <Component Type>

   The <Format Type> can have the following values (as indicated between
   the quotes):

   "FP"  Frame Packing
      The L- and R-views are packed into a single stream.  The packing
      may use a side-by-side, top-and-bottom, interleaved, checkerboard
      or frame sequential format.

   "SC"  Simulcast
      The L- and R-streams are transmitted separately.

   "2DA"  2D + auxiliary
      2D video and auxiliary data (such as depth maps or parallax maps)
      are transmitted.  These can be transmitted in a single stream, as
      well as in two separate streams.

   The <Component Type> can have the following values (as indicated
   between the quotes):

   "C"  Centre view
      The associated stream is a C-stream.

   "CD"  centre view and depth map
      The associated stream contains both the C-view and depth map
      sequences.

   "ChB"  Checkerboard
      The video frame consists of alternating pixels from the
      corresponding L- and R-views, as illustrated by Figure 1.

   "CP"  Centre view and parallax map
      The associated stream contains both the C-view and parallax map
      sequences.

Internet-Draft              Signal 3D format                October 2012


   "D"  Depth map
      The associated stream is a sequence of depth maps.

   "L"  Left view
      The associated stream is the L-stream.

   "LD"  Left view and depth map
      The associated stream contains both the L-view and depth map
      sequences.

   "LIL"  Line Interleaved
      Each video frame consists of alternating scan lines from the L-
      and R-views.

   "LP"  Left view and parallax map
      The associated stream contains both the L-view and parallax map
      sequences.

   "P"  Parallax map
      The associated stream is a sequence of parallax maps.

   "R"  Right view
      The associated stream is the R-stream.

   "SbS"  Side by Side
      Each video frame is divided in two equally sized sub-frames,
      spatially positioned side by side of each other.  One sub-frame
      contains the L-view, whereas the other contains the R-view.

   "Seq"  Frame Sequential
      The single video stream consists of alternating frames from the L-
      and R-streams.  Additional signalling, e.g.  AVC SEI messages
      [ISO/IEC 14496-10], is needed to signal which frames contain L-
      and which contain R-views.

   "TaB"  Top and Bottom
      Each video frame is divided in two equally sized sub-frames,
      spatially positioned above each other.  One sub-frame contains the
      L-view, whereas the other contains the R-view.

5.  Grouping

   When multiple streams carry a single stereoscopic 3D video, (e.g.
   C-stream and parallax map, or separately transmitted L- and
   R-streams), the grouping mechanism from [RFC5888] MUST be used.

   However, to cater for the special requirements of 3D signalling, the
   semantics are expanded:

    group-attribute     = "a=group:" semantics *(SP identification-tag)
    semantics           = "LS" / "FID" / "3DS" / semantics-extension
    semantics-extension = token

   The grouping is needed when multiple streams carry a single
   stereoscopic 3D video.  This is the case when the <format type> is
   "SC", or the <format type> is "2DA" and the 2D video and auxiliary
   data are transmitted as multiple streams.  A group with the "3Ds"
   semantics is called a "3DS group".

   A 3DS group MUST NOT contain data that is (potentially) inconsistent
   with other data in the 3DS group:

   o  A 3DS group MUST NOT contain both a parallax map stream and a
      depth map stream.

   o  A 3DS group MUST NOT contain more than one parallax map stream.

   o  A 3DS group MUST NOT contain more than one depth map stream.

   o  A 3DS group MUST contain at least one 2D video stream.

   o  If a 3GS group contains an L- and an R-stream, it MUST NOT contain
      a depth map or a parallax map.

   o  If a 3DS group contains only one 2D video stream, it MUST also
      contain a parallax map stream or a depth map stream.

   o  If a 3DS group contains a parallax map stream or a depth map
      stream, it MUST also contain a 2D video stream.

7.  SDP offer/answer with 3D support

   This section describes how the SDP offer/answer model (see [RFC3264])
   can be used to negotiate the 3D format.  It is assumed that both
   offerer and answerer are compliant to this document.  The case where
   the answerer is a legacy answerer is described in Section 8.

   An example where the SDP offer/answer model can be used to negotiate
   the 3D format, is the case where the offerer offers two
   representations of the same stereoscopic 3D video: one frame packed
   and one as L/R simulcast.  In this case, the answerer can select the
   format of its preference, according to its capabilities or as a
   trade-off between bandwidth and video quality.

   There may also be cases where the answerer prefers to receive a 2D
   version, even when it supports stereoscopic 3D video and the
   "3dFormat" attribute.  For example, this might happen when the user
   prefers to watch without glasses this time.

   The following statements apply for the answerer:

   o  The answerer MUST NOT omit the "3dFormat" attribute for the
      accepted streams.  The answerer MAY omit the "3dFormat" attribute
      for the rejected streams.

   o  The answerer MUST NOT change the value of the "3dFormat"
      attribute.  This means, that the answerer can only choose between
      the 3D formats advertised in the offer.

   o  In case the offer contains simulcast of the L- and R-view, the
      answerer MAY choose just one view.  In this case, it MUST select
      only that view.  This means that the port number of the other view
      MUST be set to zero in the answer.

   o  In case the offer contains a 2D stream and an auxiliary stream as
      separate streams, the answerer MAY choose only the 2D stream.  In
      this case, it MUST select the 2D stream, and MUST NOT select the
      auxiliary stream.  This means that the port number of the
      auxiliary stream MUST be set to zero in the answer.

   o  In case the offer contains a 2D stream and an auxiliary stream as
      a single stream, the answerer MAY choose to reject the stream by
      setting the port number in the answer to zero.

   o  In case of frame packing, if the answerer prefers not to have
      frame packing, it MUST reject the stream by setting the port
      number in the answer to zero.

Internet-Draft              Signal 3D format                October 2012


   o  If the answerer selects multiple 3D formats, it MUST be prepared
      to send/receive (depending on whether it is a streaming server or
      client or both) associated streams simultaneously.

   The following statements apply for the offerer:

   o  The offerer MUST check if the "3dFormat" attribute is included in
      the answer.  If it is not, it SHOULD handle the answer as
      described in Section 8.

   o  The offerer SHOULD list the 3D formats in order of preference.

   o  When multiple 3D formats are selected, the offerer MAY initiate
      all associated streams.  Alternatively, it MAY update its offer
      with a reduced number of 3D formats.

   o  If all 3D formats have been rejected, the offerer MAY issue a new
      offer with 2D video instead.

   o  If only an auxiliary stream is selected in the answer, the offerer
      SHOULD update its offer with only the associated 2D video stream.
      Alternatively, it MAY update its offer advertising another 3D
      format.

8.  SDP offer/answer without 3D support

   Since a legacy answerer does not support the "3dFormat" attribute, it
   might reject the offer.  In this case the offerer MAY send a new
   offer with only a 2D video stream.

   On the other hand, it is also possible that the legacy answerer
   accepts the offer but omits the "3dFormat" attribute in the answer.
   In this case the offerer is able to deduct that the answerer is a
   legacy answerer without 3D support.  In the following subsections, we
   describe what the offerer still can do to provide a good user
   experience with a legacy answerer, for each of the 3D format styles.
   We assume that the offer was accepted, but a legacy answerer was
   detected.

8.1.  Frame packing

   In case the original offer contains frame packing, and the answer
   does not contain the "3dFormat" attribute, the offerer SHOULD treat
   that media stream as a 2D stream.

   Note: in some cases, the answerer may be a legacy device that is
   capable of rendering a frame packed 3D stream, but does not
   understand the "3dFormat" attribute.  For example, the user may be
   able to switch manually to 3D. Therefore, the server MAY stream the
   frame packed video as it is.

8.2.  2D and auxiliary as a single stream

   If the original offer contains a 2D video and an auxiliary video in a
   single stream, and the answer does not contain the "3dFormat"
   attribute, the offerer SHOULD treat that media stream as a 2D stream.

8.3.  2D and auxiliary as two separate streams

   When the offerer sends an offer to a legacy answerer, and the offer
   contains a 2D video and an auxiliary video in two separate streams,
   there are the following possibilities:

   o  If the answerer selects only the 2D video stream then 2D video
      streaming can be done as agreed.

   o  If the answerer selects only the auxiliary video, the offerer MAY
      treat that stream as a 2D video stream.  If it does not, the
      offerer SHOULD update its offer without the auxiliary video.

   o  If the answerer selects both video streams, but omits the
      "3dFormat" attribute, the offerer MAY update its offer without the

      auxiliary video.

   In case the offerer updates its offer by setting the port for
   auxiliary video to zero, it MUST NOT include the "3dFormat" attribute
   or use "3DS" grouping for the 2D stream.

8.4.  Simulcast of L- and R-views

   When the offerer sends an offer to simulcast the L- and R-view to the
   legacy answerer, we have the following possibilities:

   o  If the answerer selects only one video stream, the offerer MAY
      stream the 2D video as agreed.

   o  If the answerer selects both video streams, but omits the
      "3dFormat" attribute, the offerer MAY update its offer with only
      the L- or the R-stream.

   In case the offerer updates its offer with only the L- or R-stream by
   setting one of the ports to zero, it MUST NOT include the "3dFormat"
   attribute or use "3DS" grouping for the offered stream.

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  "3dFormat" attribute

   Following the guidelines in [RFC4566], the SDP attribute has to be
   registered at IANA:

   o  Contact name/email: authors of this RFC

   o  Attribute name: 3dFormat

   o  Long-form attribute name: Attribute for signalling the format of a
      stereoscopic 3D video carried in the media stream(s).

   o  Type of attribute: media level

   o  Subject to charset: no

   The "3dFormat" SDP media-level attribute is used to signal the format
   of stereoscopic 3D video, carried in one or more media stream(s).

   The attribute has the following syntax:

                 a=3dFormat:<Format Type> <Component Type>

   The <Format Type> indicates the format type of the stereoscopic 3D
   video carried in the media stream(s).  It indicates whether the
   stereoscopic 3D video is frame packed, simulcast or consists of a 2D
   video stream and an auxiliary stream.  The <Format Type> can have the
   following values (as indicated between the quotes):

      "FP"     frame packed
      "SC"     simulcast
      "2DA"    2D + auxiliary

   The <Component Type> indicates the type of the video component, which
   is a constituent element of the stereoscopic 3D video.  It can have
   the following values:
