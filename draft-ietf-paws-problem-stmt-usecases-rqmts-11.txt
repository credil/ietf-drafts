     Protocol to Access White Space (PAWS) Database: Use Cases and
                              Requirements

Abstract

   Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use
   but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are
   defined as "white space."  The concept of allowing additional
   transmissions (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is a
   technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use.  An obvious
   requirement is that these additional transmissions do not interfere
   with the assigned use of the spectrum.  One approach to using white
   space spectrum at a given time and location is to verify spectrum
   availability with a database that manages spectrum sharing and
   provides spectrum-availability information.  The IETF has undertaken
   to develop a Protocol to Access Spectrum Database [1] for such a
   management database.

   This document describes a number of possible use cases of white space
   spectrum and technology as well as a set of requirements for the
   database query protocol.  The concept of white spaces is described
   along with the problems that need to be addressed to enable white
   space spectrum for additional uses without causing interference to
   currently assigned use.  Use of white space is enabled by querying a
   database that stores information about spectrum availability at any
   given location and time.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Introduction to white space

   Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments.
   The spectrum is used for various purposes, which include, but are not
   limited to, entertainment (e.g., radio and television), communication
   (e.g., telephony and Internet access), military (e.g., radars etc.),
   and navigation (e.g., satellite communication, GPS).  Portions of the
   radio spectrum that are assigned to a licensed (primary) user but are
   unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as
   "white space."  The concept of allowing additional (secondary)
   transmissions (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is a
   technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use.  An obvious
   requirement is that these secondary transmissions do not interfere
   with the assigned use of the spectrum.  One interesting observation
   is that often, in a given physical location, the primary user(s) may
   not be using the entire band assigned to them.  The available
   spectrum for secondary transmissions would then depend on the
   location of the secondary user.  The fundamental issue is how to
   determine, for a specific location and specific time, if any of the
   assigned spectrum is available for secondary use.  Academia and
   Industry have studied multiple cognitive radio [2] mechanisms for use
   in such a scenario.  One simple mechanism is to use a geospatial
   database that contains the spatial and temporal profile of all
   primary licensees' spectrum usage, and require secondary users to
   query the database for available spectrum that they can use at their
   location.  Such databases can be accessible and queryable by
   secondary users on the Internet .

   Any entity that is assigned spectrum that is not densely used may be
   asked by a governmental regulatory agency to share it to allow for
   more intensive use of the spectrum.  Providing a mechanism by which
   secondary users share the spectrum with the primary user is
   attractive in many bands in many countries.

   This document includes the problem statement followed by use cases
   and requirements associated with the use of white space spectrum by
   secondary users via a database query protocol.

1.2.  Scope

1.2.1.  In Scope

   This document covers the requirements for a protocol to allow a
   device to access a database to obtain spectrum availability
   information.  Such a protocol should allow a device to perform the
   following actions:

   1.  Determine the relevant white space database to query.

   2.  Connect to and optionally register with the database using a
       well-defined protocol.

   3.  Provide its geolocation and perhaps other data to the database
       using a well-defined format for querying the database.

   4.  Receive in response to the query a list of available white space
       frequencies using a well-defined format for the information.

   5.  Send an acknowledgment to the database with information
       containing channels selected for use by the device.

1.2.2.  Out of Scope

   The following topics are out of scope for this specification:

   1.  Co-existence and interference avoidance of white space devices
       within the same spectrum.

   2.  Provisioning (releasing new spectrum for white space use).

3.  Protocol Services

3.1.  Protocol services

   A complete protocol solution must enable many different potential
   white space services.  This section describes the features required
   of the protocol.

3.1.1.  White space database discovery

   White space database discovery is preliminary to creating a radio
   network using white space; it is a prerequisite to the use cases
   below.  The radio network is created by a master device.  Before the
   master device can transmit in white space spectrum, it must contact a
   trusted database where the device can learn if any spectrum is
   available for its use.  The master device will need to discover a
   trusted database, using the following steps:

   1.  The master device is connected to the Internet.

   2.  The master device constructs and sends a service request over the
       Internet.

   3.  If no acceptable response is received within a pre-configured
       time limit, the master device concludes that no trusted database
       is available.  If at least one response is received, the master
       device evaluates the response(s) to determine if a trusted
       database can be identified where the master device is able to
       receive service from the database.

   Optionally the radio device is pre-programmed with the Internet
   address of at least one trusted database.  The device can establish
   contact with a trusted database using one of the pre-programmed

   Internet addresses and establish a white space network (as described
   in one of the following use cases).

3.1.2.  Device registration with trusted database

   In some regulatory domains, the master device must register with the
   trusted database before it queries the database for available
   spectrum.  Different regulatory domains may have different device
   registration requirements.

   Figure 1 (Figure 1) shows an example deployment of this scenario.

                                                       ----------

                                             (---)

    Figure 1: Example illustration of registration requirement in white
                              space use-case

   A simplified operational scenario showing registration consists of
   the following steps:

   1.  If required by the regulatory domain, the master device registers
       with its most current and up-to-date information.  If subject to
       registration, typically the master device will register after
       power up, after changing location by a predetermined distance,
       and after prescribed time intervals.

   2.  To register with the database, the master device sends
       registration information to the database.  This information may
       include the Device ID, serial number assigned by the
       manufacturer, device location, device antenna height above
       ground, name of the individual or business that owns the device,
       and the name, street and email address, and telephone number of a
       contact person responsible for the device's operation.

   3.  The database responds to the registration request with an
       acknowledgement to indicate the success of the registration
       request or with an error if the registration was unsuccessful.
       Additional information may be provided by the database in its
       response according to regulatory requirements.

4.  Use Cases

   There are many potential use cases for white space spectrum - for
   example, providing broadband Internet access in urban and densely-
   populated hotspots as well as rural and remote, underserved areas.
   Available white space spectrum may also be used to provide Internet
   'backhaul' for traditional Wi-Fi hotspots or for use by towns and
   cities to monitor/control traffic lights, read utility meters, and
   the like.  Still other use cases include the ability to offload data
   traffic from another Internet access network (e.g., 3G cellular
   network) or to deliver data, information, or a service to a user
   based on the user's location.  Some of these use cases are described
   in the following sections.

4.1.  Use cases

4.1.1.  Master-slave white space networks

   There are a number of common scenarios in which a master white space
   device will act as proxy or mediator for one or more slave devices
   using its connection to the Internet to query the database for
   available spectrum for itself and for one or more slave devices.
   These slave devices may be fixed or mobile, in close proximity with
   each other (indoor network or urban hotspot), or at a distance (rural
   or remote WAN).  Once slave devices switch to white space spectrum
   for their communications, they may connect through the master to the
   Internet or use white space spectrum for intra-network communications
   only.  The master device can continue to arbitrate and control white
   space communications by slave devices, and may notify them when they
   are required to change white space frequencies or cease white space
   communications.

   Figure 2 (Figure 2) depicts the general architecture such a simple
   master-slave network, in which the master device communicates on its
   own behalf and on behalf of slave devices with a white space
   database.

                Figure 2: Master-Slave White Space Network

   The protocol requirements for these master-slave device and other
   similar scenarios is essentially the same: the protocol must support
   the ability of a master device to make available-spectrum query
   requests on behalf of slave devices, passing device identification,
   geolocation, and other slave device parameters to the database as
   required to obtain a list of white space spectrum available for use
   by one or more slave devices.  Of course, different use cases will
   use this spectrum information in different ways, and the details of
   master/slave communications may be different for different use cases.

   Common steps may occur in master-slave networks include the
   following:

   1.  The master device powers up.

   2.  Slave devices power up and associate with the master device via
       Wi-Fi or some other over-the-air non-white space spectrum.  Until
       the slave device is allocated white space spectrum, any master-
       slave or slave-slave communications occurs over such non-white
       space spectrum.

   3.  The master has Internet connectivity, determines (or knows) its
       location, and establishes a connection to a trusted white space
       database (see Section 4.1.1).




Mancuso, et al.           Expires July 29, 2013                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          paws-use-cases-and-reqmts           January 2013


   4.  The master optionally registers with the trusted database (see
       Section 4.1.2).

   5.  The master sends a query to the trusted database requesting a
       list of available WS channels based upon its geolocation.  Query
       parameters may include the master's location, device identifier,
       and antenna height.

   6.  The database responds to the master's query with a list of
       available white space spectrum, associated maximum power levels,
       and a duration of time for its use.

   7.  The slave devices may query the master for a channel list.  The
       master may relay available-spectrum requests to the database on
       behalf of slave devices, then transmit the obtained available-
       spectrum lists to the slaves (or the master may allocate spectrum
       to slaves from the obtained spectrum lists).

   8.  Once a slave device has been allocated available white space
       spectrum frequencies for communication over the network, it may
       inform the master of the frequencies and power level it has
       chosen, and the master may, in turn, relay such usage to the
       database.

   9.  Further communication among masters and slaves over the network
       occurs via the selected/allocated white space spectrum
       frequencies.

4.1.2.  Offloading: moving traffic to a white space network

   This scenario is a variant of the master-slave network described in
   the previous use case.  In this scenario, an Internet connectivity
   service is provided over white space as a supplemental or alternative
   datapath to a more costly Internet connection (metered wire service,
   metered wireless service, metered satellite service).  In a typical
   deployment scenario, an end user has a primary Internet connection,
   but may prefer to use a connection to the Internet provided by a
   local white space master device that is connected to the Internet.

   Figure 3 (Figure 3) shows an example deployment of this scenario.

           Figure 3: Offloading Traffic to a White Space Network

   A simplified operation scenario of offloading content, such as video
   stream, from the a metered Internet connection to the a WS connection
   consists of the following steps:

   1.  The slave device connects to a metered Internet service, and
       selects a video for streaming.

   2.  The slave device switches mode and associates with a master white
       space device.*

   3.  The master queries the database for available white space
       spectrum and relays it to the slave device as described in
       Section 4.1.1.*

   4.  The slave uses available white space spectrum to communicate with
       the master and connect to the Internet to stream the selected
       video.

   * Note that the slave device may query the database directly for
   available white space spectrum through its metered connection to the
   Internet, thus eliminating steps 2 and 3.

   In this use case, an Internet connectivity service is provided to
   users over a common wireless standard, such as Wi-Fi, with a white

              Figure 4: White Space Network Used for Backhaul

   Once the bridged device (WS + Wi-Fi) is connected to a master and WS
   network, a simplified operation scenario of backhaul for Wi-Fi
   consists of the following steps:

   1.  A bridged slave device (WS + Wi-Fi) is connected to a master
       device operating in the WS spectrum (the master obtains available
       white space spectrum as described in Section 4.1.1).

   2.  Once the slave device is connected to the master, the Wi-Fi
       access point has Internet connectivity as well.

   3.  End users attach to the Wi-Fi network via their Wi-Fi enabled
       devices and receive Internet connectivity.

4.1.4.  Rapid network deployment during emergency scenario

   Organizations involved in handling emergency operations maintain an
   infrastructure that relies on dedicated spectrum for their
   operations.  However, such infrastructures are often affected by the
   disasters they handle.  To set up a replacement network, spectrum
   needs to be quickly cleared and reallocated to the crisis response
   organization.  Automation of the this allocation and assignment is
   often the best solution.  A preferred option is to make use of a
   robust protocol that has been adopted and implemented by radio
   manufacturers.  A typical network topology solution might include
   wireless access links to the public Internet or private network,

   wireless ad-hoc network radios working independent of a fixed
   infrastructure, and satellite links for backup where lack of
   coverage, overload, or outage of wireless access links can occur.

       Figure 5: Rapid-deployed Network with Partly-connected Nodes

   In the ad-hoc network, all nodes are master nodes that allocate RF
   channels from the white space database (as described in
   Section 4.1.1).  However, the backhaul link may not be available to
   all nodes, such as depicted for the left node in the above figure.
   To handle RF channel allocation for such nodes, a master node with a
   backhaul link relays or proxies the database query for them.  So
   master nodes without a backhaul link follow the procedure as defined
   for clients.  The ad-hoc network radios utilize the provided RF
   channels.  Details on forming and maintenance of the ad-hoc network,
   including repair of segmented networks caused by segments operating
   on different RF channels, is out of scope of spectrum allocation.

4.1.5.  White space used for local TV broadcaster

   Available white space spectrum can be deployed in novel ways to
   leverage the public use of hand-held and portable devices.  One such
   use is white space spectrum used for local TV transmission of audio-
   video content to portable devices used by individuals in attendance

   at an event.  In this use case, audience members at a seminar,
   entertainment event, or other venue plug a miniature TV receiver fob
   into their laptop, computer tablet, cell phone, or other portable
   device.  A master device obtains a list of available white space
   spectrum (as described in , (Section 4.1.1), then broadcasts audio-
   video content locally to the audience over one of the available
   frequencies.  Audience members receive the content through their
   miniature TV receivers tuned to the appropriate white space band for
   display on their portable device monitors.

   Figure 6 (Figure 6) shows an example deployment of this scenario.

5.  Problem Statement

   The use of white space spectrum is enabled via the capability of a
   device to query a database and obtain information about the
   availability of spectrum for use at a given location.  The databases
   are reachable via the Internet and the devices querying these
   databases are expected to have some form of Internet connectivity,
   directly or indirectly.  The databases may be regulatory specific
   since the available spectrum and regulations may vary, but the
   fundamental operation of the protocol should be regulatory
   independent.

   An example high-level architecture of the devices and white space
   databases is shown in Figure 7 (Figure 7).

      Figure 7: High-level View of White Space Database Architecture

   In Figure 11, note that there could be multiple databases serving
   white space devices.  The databases are locale specific since the
   regulations and available spectrum may vary.  In some countries, for
   example, the U.S., the regulator has determined that multiple
   databases may provide service to White Space Devices.

   A messaging interface between the white space devices and the
   database is required for operating a network using the white space
   spectrum.  The following sections discuss various aspects of such an
   interface and the need for a standard.

5.1.  Global applicability

   The use of white space spectrum is currently approved or being
   considered in multiple regulatory domains, whose rules may differ.
   However, the need for devices that intend to use the spectrum to
   communicate with a database remains a common feature.  The database
   implements rules that protect all primary users, independent of the
   characteristics of the white space devices.  It also provides a way
   to specify a schedule of use, since some primary users (for example,
   wireless microphones) only operate in limited time slots.

   Devices need to be able to query a database, directly or indirectly,
   over the public Internet and/or private IP networks prior to
   operating in available spectrum.  Information about available
   spectrum, schedule, power, etc., are provided by the database as a
   response to the query from a device.  The messaging interface needs
   to be:





Mancuso, et al.           Expires July 29, 2013                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          paws-use-cases-and-reqmts           January 2013


   1.  Radio/air interface agnostic - The radio/air interface technology
       used by the white space device in available spectrum can be IEEE
       802.11af, IEEE 802.15.4m, IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.22, LTE etc.
       However the messaging interface between the white space device
       and the database should be agnostic to the air interface while
       being cognizant of the characteristics of various air-interface
       technologies and the need to include relevant attributes in the
       query to the database.

   2.  Spectrum agnostic - the spectrum used by primary and secondary
       users varies by country.  Some spectrum has an explicit notion of
       a "channel": a defined swath of spectrum within a band that has
       some assigned identifier.  Other spectrum bands may be subject to
       white space sharing, but only have actual frequency low/high
       parameters to define primary and secondary use.  The protocol
       should be able to be used in any spectrum band where white space
       sharing is permitted.

   3.  Globally applicable - A common messaging interface between white
       space devices and databases will enable the use of such spectrum
       for various purposes on a global basis.  Devices can operate in
       any locale where such spectrum is available and a common
       interface ensures uniformity in implementations and deployment.
       Since the White Space Device must know its geospatial location to
       do a query, it is possible to determine which database, and which
       rules, are applicable, even though they are locale specific.
       Note that although a device may know its geolocation, it may not
       know the country or regulatory domain that it is in.  Further,
       even if the device knows this information, it may not be
       sufficient for the device to know its expected behaviour in its
       domain of operation since one domain may adopt a rule set for
       white space device operation from another regulatory domain
       (Brazil may adopt the "FccWhitespace2010" US rule set).  To allow
       the global use of white space devices in different countries
       (whatever the regulatory domain), the protocol should support the
       Database communicating applicable rule set information to the
       white space device.

   4.  Flexible and extensible data structures - Different databases are
       likely to have different requirements for the kinds of data
       required for registration (different rule sets that apply to the
       registration of devices) and other messages sent by the device to
       the database.  For instance, different regulators might require
       different device-characteristic information to be passed to the
       database.

Internet-Draft          paws-use-cases-and-reqmts           January 2013


5.2.  Database discovery

   Another aspect of the problem space is the need to discover the
   database.  A white space device needs to find the relevant database
   to query, based on its current location or for another location.
   Since the spectrum and databases are domain specific, the device will
   need to discover the relevant database.  The device needs to
   determine the location of the specific database to which it can send
   queries in addition to registering itself for operation and using the
   available spectrum.

5.3.  Protocol

   A protocol that enables a white space device to query a database to
   obtain information about available spectrum is needed.  A device may
   be required to register with the database with some credentials prior
   to being allowed to query.  The requirements for such a protocol are
   specified in this document.

5.4.  Data model definition

   The contents of the queries and response need to be specified.  A
   data model is required which enables the white space device to query
   the database while including all the relevant information such as
   geolocation, radio technology, power characteristics, etc., which may
   be country and spectrum and regulatory dependent.  All databases are
   able to interpret the data model and respond to the queries using the
   same data model that is understood by all devices.


6.  Requirements

         information for a single location and an area (e.g., a polygon
         defined by multiple location points or a geometric shape such
         as a circle).

         power levels selected for use by a device in the
         acknowledgement message.

6.2.  Protocol Requirements

   P.1  The address of a database (e.g., in form of a URI) can be
      preconfigured in a master device.  The master device MUST be able
      to contact a database using a pre-configured database address.
      The master device may validate the database against a list of
      approved databases maintained by a regulatory body.

   P.2  The protocol must support the database informing the master of
      the regulatory rules (rule set) that applies to the master device
      (or any slave devices on whose behalf the master is contacting the
      database) at the current location or the master (or slave)
      device(s).

   P.3  The protocol MUST provide the ability for the database to
      authenticate the master device.

   P.4  The protocol MUST provide the ability for the master device to
      verify the authenticity of the database with which it is
      interacting.

      messages sent by the database to the master device MUST support
      integrity protection.

   P.6  The protocol MUST provide the capability for messages sent by
      the master device and database to be encrypted.

   P.7  The protocol MUST support the master device registering with the

   P.8  The protocol MUST support a registration acknowledgement
      including appropriate result codes.

   P.9  The protocol MUST support an available spectrum request from the
      master device to the database.  These parameters MAY include any
      of the parameters and attributes required to be supported in the
      Data Model Requirements.

   P.10  The protocol MUST support an available spectrum response from
      the database to the master device.  These parameters MAY include
      any of the parameters and attributes required to be supported in
      the Data Model Requirements.

   P.11  The protocol MUST support a spectrum usage message from the
      master device to the database.  These parameters MAY include any
      of the parameters and attributes required to be supported in the
      Data Model Requirements.

   P.12  The protocol MUST support a spectrum usage message
      acknowledgement.

   P.13  The protocol MUST support a validation request from the master

      request MUST include the slave device ID.

   P.14  The protocol MUST support a validation response from the
      database to the master to indicate if the slave device is
      validated by the WSDB.  The validation response MUST include a
      response code.

   P.15  The protocol between the master device and the database MUST
      support the capability to change spectrum availability information
      on short notice.

   P.16  The protocol between the master device and the database MUST
      support a spectrum availability request which specifies a
      geographic location as an area as well as a point

6.3.  Operational Requirements

   This section contains operational requirements of a white space
   database-device system, independent of the requirements of the
   protocol for communication between the white space database and
   devices.

   O.1  The database and the master device MUST be connected to the
      Internet.

   O.2  A master device MUST be able to determine its location including
      uncertainty and confidence level.  A fixed master device MAY use a
      location programmed at installation or have the capability to
      determine its location to the required accuracy.  A mobile master
      device MUST have the capability to determine its location to the
      required accuracy.

   O.3  The master device MUST identify a database to which it will
      register, make spectrum availability requests, etc...  The master
      device MAY select a database for service by discovery at runtime
      or the master device MAY select a database for service by means of
      a pre-programmed URI address.

Internet-Draft          paws-use-cases-and-reqmts           January 2013


   O.4  The master device MUST implement at least one connection method
      to access the database.  The master device MAY contact a database
      directly for service or the master device MAY contact a database
      listing server first followed by contact to a database.

   O.5  The master device MUST obtain an information on the rule set of
      the regulatory body that applies to the master device at its
      current location (and/or the location of any slave devices on
      whose behalf the master device is operating).

   O.6  The master device MAY register with the database according to
      local regulatory policy.  Not all master devices will be required
      to register.  Specific events will initiate registration, these
      events are determined by regulator policy (e.g., at power up,
      after movement, etc...).  When local regulatory policy requires
      registration, the master device MUST register with its most
      current and up-to-date information, and MUST include all variables
      mandated by local regulator policy.

   O.7  A master device MUST query the database for the available
      spectrum based on its current location before starting radio
      transmission in white space.  Parameters provided to the database
      MAY include device location, accuracy of the location, antenna
      characteristic information, device identifier of any slave device
      requesting spectrum information, etc.

   O.8  The database MUST respond to an available spectrum list request
      from an authenticated and authorized device and MAY also provide
      time constraints, maximum output power, start and stop frequencies
      for each band in the list and any additional requirements for
      sensing.

   O.9  According to local regulator policy, a master device MAY inform
      the database of the actual frequency usage of the master and its
      slaves.  The master MUST include parameters required by local
      regulatory policy, e.g., device ID, manufacturer's serial number,
      spectrum usage and power level information of the master and its
      slaves.

   O.10  After connecting to a master device's radio network a slave
      device MUST query the master device for a list of available
      spectrum.  The slave MUST include parameters required by local
      regulatory policy, e.g., device ID, device location.

   O.11  According to local regulatory policy, the master device MAY
      query the database with parameters received from the slave device.

   O.12  The database MUST respond to a query from the master device
      containing parameters from a slave device.

   O.13  A master device MUST repeat the query to the database for the
      available spectrum as often as required by the regulation (e.g.,
      FCC requires once per day) to verify that the operating channels
      continue to remain available.

   O.14  A master device which changes its location more than a
      threshold distance (specified by local regulatory policy) during
      its operation, MUST query the database for available operating
      spectrum each time it moves more than the threshold distance
      (e.g., FCC specifies 100m) from the location it previously made
      the query.

   O.15  According to local regulator policy, a master device may
      contact a database via proxy service of another master device.

   O.16  A master device MUST be able to query the whitespace database
      for spectrum availability information for a specific expected
      coverage area around its current location.

   O.17  A Master device MUST include its unique identity in all message
      exchanges with the database.

6.4.  Guidelines

   The current scope of the working group is limited and is reflected in
   the requirements captured in Section 6.1.  However white space
   technology itself is expected to evolve and address other aspects
   such as co-existence and interference avoidance, spectrum brokering,
   alternative spectrum bands, etc.  The design of the data model and
   protocol should be cognizant of the evolving nature of white space
   technology and consider the following set of guidelines in the
   development of the data model and protocol:

   1.  The data model SHOULD provide a modular design separating out
       messaging specific, administrative specific, and spectrum
       specific parts into separate modules.

   2.  The protocol SHOULD support determination of which administrative
       specific and spectrum specific modules are used.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   PAWS is a protocol whereby a Master Device requests a schedule of
   available spectrum at its location (or location of its Slave Devices)
   before it (they) can operate using those frequencies.  Whereas the
   information provided by the Database must be accurate and conform to
   applicable regulatory rules, the Database cannot enforce, through the
   protocol, that a client device uses only the spectrum it provided.
   In other words, devices can put energy in the air and cause
   interference without asking the Database.  Hence, PAWS security
   considerations do not include protection against malicious use of the
   White Space spectrum.

   Threat model for the PAWS protocol:

      Assumptions:

         It is assumed that an attacker has full access to the network
         medium between the master device and the white space database.
         The attacker may be able to eavesdrop on any communications
         between these entities.  The link between the master device and
         the white space database can be wired or wireless and provides
         IP connectivity.

         It is assumed that both the master device and the white space
         database have NOT been compromised from a security standpoint.

      Threat 1: User modifies a device to masquerade as another valid
      certified device

         Regulatory environments require that devices be certified and
         register in ways that accurately reflect their certification.
         Without suitable protection mechanisms, devices could simply
         listen to registration exchanges, and later registering
         claiming to be those other devices.  Such replays would allow
         false registration, violating regulatory regimes.  A white
         space database may be operated by a commercial entity which
         restricts access only to authorized users.  A master device MAY
         need to identify itself to the database and be authorized to
         obtain information about available spectrum.

      Threat 2: Spoofed white space database

         A master device discovers a white space database(s) through
         which it can query for available spectrum information.  The
         master device needs to ensure that the white space database
         with which it communicates with is an authentic entity.  The
         white space database needs to provide its identity to the



Mancuso, et al.           Expires July 29, 2013                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft          paws-use-cases-and-reqmts           January 2013


         master device which can confirm the validity/authenticity of
         the database.  An attacker may attempt to spoof a white space
         database and provide responses to a master device which are
         malicious and result in the master device causing interference
         to the primary user of the spectrum.

      Threat 3: Modifying a query request

         An attacker may modify the query request sent by a master
         device to a white space database.  The attacker may change the
         location of the device or the capabilities in terms of its
         transmit power or antenna height etc., which could result in
         the database responding with incorrect information about
         available spectrum or max transmit power allowed.  The result
         of such an attack is that the master device would cause
         interference to the primary user of the spectrum.  It could
         also result in a denial of service to the master device by
         indicating that no channels are available.

      Threat 4: Modifying a query response

         An attacker could modify the query response sent by the white
         space database to a master device.  The available spectrum
         information or transmit power allowed type of parameters
         carried in the response could be modified by the attacker
         resulting in the master device using spectrum that is not
         available at a location or transmitting at a greater power
         level than allowed resulting in interference to the primary
         user of that spectrum.  Alternatively the attacker may indicate
         no spectrum availability at a location resulting in a denial of
         service to the master device.

      Threat 5: Third party tracking of white space device location and
      identity

         A white space database in a regulatory domain may require a
         master device to provide its identity in addition to its
         location in the query request.  Such location/identity
         information can be gleaned by an eavesdropper and used for
         tracking purposes.  A master device may prefer to keep the
         location/identity information hidden from eavesdroppers, hence
         the protocol should provide a means to protect the location and
         identity information of the master device and prevent tracking
         of locations associated with a white space database query.
         When the master device sends both its identity and location to
         the DB, the DB is able to track it.  If a regulatory domain
         does not require the master device to provide its identity to
         the white space database, the master device may decide not to

Internet-Draft          paws-use-cases-and-reqmts           January 2013


         send its identity, to prevent being tracked by the DB.

      Threat 6: Malicious individual acts as a PAWS entity (spoofing DB
      or as MiM) to terminate or unfairly limit spectrum access of
      devices for reasons other than incumbent protection

         A white space database MAY include a mechanism by which service
         and spectrum allocated to a master device can be revoked by
         sending an unsolicited message.  A malicious node can pretend
         to be the white space database with which a master device has
         registered or obtained spectrum information from and send a
         revoke message to that device.  This results in denial of
         service to the master device.

      Threat 7: Natural disaster resulting in inability to obtain
      authorization for white space spectrum use by emergency responders

         In the case of a sizable natural disaster a lot of Internet
         infrastructure ceases to function, emergency services users
         need to reconstitute quickly and will rely on establishing
         radio WANs.  In such cases, radio WAN gear that has been unused
         suddenly needs to be pressed into action.  And the radio WANs
         need frequency authorizations to function.  Regulatory entities
         may also authorize usage of additional spectrum in the affected
         areas.  The white space radio entities may need to establish
         communication with a database and obtain authorizations.  In
         cases where communication with the white space database fails,
         the white space devices cannot utilize white space spectrum.
         Emergency services, which require more spectrum precisely at
         locations where network infrastructure is malfunctioning or
         overloaded, backup communication spectrum and distributed white
         space databases are needed to overcome such circumstances.
         Alternatively there may be other mechanisms which allow the use
         of spectrum by emergency service equipment without strict
         authorization or with liberal interpretation of the regulatory
         policy for white space usage.

   The security requirements arising from the above threats are captured
   in the requirements of Section 6.1 (Section 6.1).


9.  Summary and Conclusion

   Wireless spectrum is a scarce resource.  As the demand for spectrum
   grows, there is a need to more efficiently utilize the available and
   allocated spectrum.  Cognitive radio technologies enable the
   efficient usage of spectrum via means such as sensing or by querying
   a database to determine available spectrum at a given location for

   opportunistic use.  "White space" is the general term used to refer
   to the bands within the spectrum which are available for secondary
   use at a given location.  In order to use this spectrum, a device
   needs to query a database that maintains information about the
   available spectrum within a band.  A protocol is necessary for
   communication between the devices and databases that is globally
   applicable.

   The document describes some examples of the role of the white space
   database in the operation of a radio network, and also provides
   examples of services provided to the user of a white space device.
   From these use cases, requirements are determined.  These
   requirements are to be used as input for the development of a
   Protocol to Access White Space database (PAWS).
