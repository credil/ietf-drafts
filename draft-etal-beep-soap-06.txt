This memo specifies a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) binding to
the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol core (BEEP).  A SOAP binding
describes how SOAP messages are transmitted in the
network.

The SOAP is an XML-based (extensible markup language) messaging
protocol used to implement a wide variety of distributed messaging
models.  It defines a message format and describes a variety of
message patterns, including, but not limited to, RPC, asynchronous
event notification, unacknowledged messages, and forwarding via SOAP
intermediaries.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
