                     Signalling the Presence of NAT
                   draft-bellis-behave-natpresent-00

Abstract

   End-to-end applications have difficulty distinguishing between
   packets that have been passed through a Network Address Translator
   (NAT) and packets that have been passed along a clear end-to-end
   path.  We propose mechanisms for IPv4 and IPv6 whereby NAT devices
   explicitly signal their operation as a means of allowing applications
   to distinguish the presence of otherwise undetected NATs in the end-
   to-end path.

Internet-Draft               NAT Signalling                 October 2011


1.  Introduction

   End-to-end applications have difficulty distinguishing between
   packets that have been passed through a Network Address Translator
   (NAT) [RFC3022] and packets that have been passed along a clear end-
   to-end path.

   The problem identified here is that detecting the presence of NATs in
   the path can be challenging for an application.  The UPnP Forum has
   defined the Internet Gateway Device (IGD) V2.0 protocol [IGDP] as a
   means of detecting the presence of a local NAT, and as a means of
   directing the NAT to perform certain actions regarding the NAT
   binding behaviour between internal addresses and ports and external
   addresses and ports.  However, this approach fails if the NAT is not
   local, or if there are one or more remote NATs in the end-to-end path
   in addition to a local NAT.

   For example, an application may believe that IGD has successfully
   detected the NAT, and the application can use the IGD protocol to
   learn the external IP address that is used by the NAT for this
   application's communications, to direct the NAT to perform certain
   port mappings and to assign a lease time to a NAT binding, but the
   presence of a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) further along the network path
   is then undetectable by the application using the IGD protocol, and
   the application behaves unpredictably.

   We note the directive in [RFC3514] concerning the setting of a bit
   flag in the IPv4 [RFC0791] packet header by NATs, and we redefine
   here the use of this bit flag as a means of distinguishing the
   presence of an otherwise undetected NAT in the end-to-end path.

   We also define an IPv6 [RFC2460] hop-by-hop option with similar
   semantics.

   To allow a distinction to be drawn between NATs that are detected by
   IGD-capable applications and all other otherwise IGD-undetected NATs
   in the path, we propose here (but do not specify) an extension to the
   IGD protocol to allow IGD to direct the NAT not to apply the
   mechanisms herein on a per-binding basis, in the same manner as IGD
   already allows for control of the binding time in the NAT.


2.  Terminology used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               NAT Signalling                 October 2011


3.  Specification

3.1.  IPv4

3.1.1.  Definition

   For IPv4 packets all NATs MUST set the NAT Present bit ("E", below)
   in the header of all IPv4 packets that have had their address and/or
   port fields altered by the NAT.

3.1.2.  Syntax

   The high-order bit of the IPv4 [RFC0791] fragment offset field has
   been defined for use by NATs in [RFC3514].

   The bit field is laid out as follows:


          0
         +-+
         |E|
         +-+


   In the context of detection of NATs, the currently-assigned values
   for this bit are defined as follows:

   0x0  If the bit is set to 0, the packet has not traversed a NAT, or
        the NAT has been directed not to set the bit in a manner
        supported by an IGD interaction.

   0x1  If the bit is set to 1, the packet has been altered by one or
        more NAT devices along the path.

3.2.  IPv6

3.2.1.  Definition

   For IPv6 [RFC2460] the presence of a NAT is conveyed in a hop-by-hop
   NAT Present option containing an 8 bit counter.

   All IPv6 NATs MUST increment this counter value in the NAT Present
   option in all packets that have had their address and/or port fields
   altered by the NAT.  If this option is not present in the packet, the
   NAT MUST add the option to the packet header with an initial value of
   1.

Internet-Draft               NAT Signalling                 October 2011


3.2.2.  Syntax

   The option is laid out as follows:


         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |  Type = TBC1  |   LEN = 0x01  |    VALUE      |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Note that the two highest order bits of the tag are both clear,
   indicating that the option should be skipped if it is not recognised,
   and that the third highest-order bit is set, indicating that the
   option's value may change en-route.

3.3.  Protocol Translation

   All protocol-translating NATs MUST apply the relevant NAT Present bit
   or option on outbound packets.


4.  Application Processing

   Applications that receive a packet with a non-zero NAT Present option
   MUST assume that the IP header's source and destination address, the
   transport level source and destination ports and even the IP version
   value may have been altered by a NAT in the end-to-end path.

   We anticipate (but do not define) that applications will access the
   NAT Present value using the UNIX "getsockopt()" system call or its
   equivalent in other operating systems.

   An application MAY use extensions to the IGD protocol to direct a NAT
   NOT to add the NAT Present option as part of the IGD-managed settings
   on individual NAT bindings.

   If the IPv4 bit or IPv6 option is already present in a packet and its
   value is non-zero, the IGD protocol extension MUST be ignored.  Hence
   for IPv4 the bit must remain set, and for IPv6 for value must be
   incremented, as specified above.


5.  Related Work

   RFC 3514 defines other forms of semantic intent that would set this
   bit field in the IPv4 header.  We are comfortable that these
   additional semantics are entirely consistent with this IPv4 NAT
   Present bit.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the value TBC1 in the IANA
   Hop-by-Hop Option Type registry, with required 'act' value of '00'
   and 'chg' value of '1'.
