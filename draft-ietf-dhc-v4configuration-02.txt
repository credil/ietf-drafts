        Provisioning IPv4 Configuration Over IPv6 Only Networks
                   draft-ietf-dhc-v4configuration-02

Abstract

   As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are
   taking the approach of deploying IPv6 only networks, without dual-
   stack functionality for IPv4.  However, access to IPv4 based services
   is still an ongoing requirement and approaches such as IPv4-in-IPv6
   softwire tunnels are being developed to meet this need.

   In order to provision end-user's hosts with the necessary IPv4
   configuration, a number of different mechanisms have been proposed.
   This memo discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each, with the aim
   of recommending a single approach as the basis for future work.

1.  Introduction

   A service provider with an IPv6-only network must also be able to
   provide customers with access to the Internet and other services over
   IPv4.  Softwire based IPv4-in-IPv6 tunneling mechanisms are an
   obvious example of this, such as the ones described in:

   o  [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6]

   o  [I-D.ietf-softwire-map]

   o  [I-D.ietf-softwire-unified-cpe]

   A general trend here is to relocate NAT44 functionality and IPv4
   address sharing from the centralized tunnel concentrator to the CPE
   in order to achieve better scalability.  This results in the need to
   provision a number of configuration parameters to the CPE, such as
   the external public IPv4 address and a restricted port-range to use
   for NAT.  These parameters are pre-requisites for successfully
   configuring the client for providing IPv4 based connectivity.

   In order to configure customer's devices for softwire functionality,
   a dynamic provisioning mechanism is necessary.  In IPv4 only
   networks, DHCPv4 has often been used to provide IPv4 configuration,
   but in an IPv6 only network, DHCPv4 messages cannot be transported
   natively.

   Although IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel clients are currently the only
   use-case for DHCP based configuration of IPv4 parameters in IPv6 only
   networks, a suitable approach must not be limited to only supporting
   the configuration of softwires or other specific underlying IPv4 over
   IPv6 architectures or mechanisms.  DHCPv4 options may also need to be
   conveyed to clients for configuring IPv4 based services, e.g. SIP
   server addresses.

   This document describes and compares five different methods which
   have been proposed as solutions to this problem.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6     September 2013


1.1.  Overview of IPv4 Parameter Configuration Approaches

   The following approaches for transporting IPv4 configuration
   parameters over IPv6 only networks have been suggested:

   1.  Adapt DHCPv4 format messages to be transported over IPv6 as
       described in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6].  For brevity, this
       is referred to as DHCPv4o6.

   2.  Extend DHCPv6 with new options for IPv4 configuration, such as
       [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp] describes.

   3.  Use DHCPv6 as above for external IPv4 address and source port
       configuration.  Use DHCPv4 over IPv4 messages within an IPv6
       softwire for configuring additional parameters.  This is referred
       to as DHCPv6+DHCPv4oSW.

   4.  Use DHCPv4 over IPv4 messages transported over a broadcast
       capable IPv4overIPv6 transport (e.g. a softwire) for all IPv4
       configuration including the external IPv4 address and source port
       configuration.  This is referred to as DHCPv4oSW.

   5.  Use DHCPv4 format messages, transporting them within a new DHCPv6
       message type as described in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].
       This is referred to as DHCPv4oDHCPv6.

   At the time of writing, working examples of the first two approaches
   have been developed and successfully tested in several different
   operators networks.  The fourth approach has been tested successfully
   in a lab environment.  The remaining two methods are still
   theoretical.

   The following sections provide describe each of the approaches in
   more detail.

1.2.  DHCPv4o6 Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   In order to receive IPv4 configuration parameters, IPv4-only clients
   initiate and exchange DHCPv4 messages with the DHCPv4 server.  In
   order adapt this to an IPv6-only network, an existing DHCPv4 client
   implements a 'Client Relay' (CRA) function, which takes DHCPv4
   messages and puts them into UDPv6 and IPv6.

   As the mechanism involves unicast based communications, the IPv6
   address of the server must be provisioned to the client.  This option
   is described in [I-D.mrugalski-softwire-dhcpv4-over-v6-option].

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6     September 2013


   The DHCPv4o6 server must provide an IPv6 interface to the client.
   This interface may be directly on the server and/or via an
   intermediary 'Transport Relay Agent' device can act as the gateway
   between the IPv4 and IPv6 domains.

   For the dynamic allocation of IPv4 addresses, the DHCPv4 server needs
   to be extended to support the new DHCPv4o6 functionality, such as the
   storing the IPv6 address of DHCPv4o6 clients and implementing the
   CRA6ADDR option.

   This approach currently uses functional elements for ingress and
   egress of the IPv6-only transport domain--the CRA on the host and the
   TRA or TSV on the server.  As a result, this approach has sometimes
   been referred to as a tunneling approach.  However, relay agent
   encapsulation is not a tunnel, since it carries only DHCP traffic; it
   would be more accurate to describe it as an encapsulation based
   transport.

   It is worth noting that there is no technical reason for using relay
   encapsulation for DHCPv4o6; this approach was taken because the
   authors of the draft originally imagined that it might be used to
   provide configuration information for an unmodified DHCPv4 client.
   However, this turns out not to be a viable approach: in order for
   this to work, there would have to be IPv4 routing on the local link
   to which the client is connected.  In that case, there's no need for
   DHCPv4o6.

   Given that this is the case, there is no technical reason why
   DHCPv4o6 can't simply use the IPv6 transport directly, without any
   relay encapsulation.  This would greatly simplify the specification
   and the implementation, and would still address the requirements
   stated in this document.

   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6] decribes this solution in detail.

   The protocol stack is as follows:

   DHCPv4/UDPv6/IPv6

1.3.  DHCPv6 Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   In this approach, DHCPv6 [RFC3315] would be extended with new DHCPv6
   options for configuring all IPv4 based services and functions, (i.e.
   IPv4 address assignment and any necessary DHCPv4 options).  DHCPv4
   options needed by IPv4 clients connected to the IPV6 network are
   updated as new DHCPv6 native options carrying IPv4 configuration
   parameters.  IPv4 address leasing would also need to be managed by
   the DHCPv6 server.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6     September 2013


   At the time of writing, it is not known how many such options would
   need to be ported from DHCPv4 to DHCPv6.

   An example of this approach is described in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp], where a DHCPv6 message is used to
   convey the parameters necessary for IPv4 in IPv6 softwire
   configuration.

   The protocol stack is as follows:

   DHCPv6/UDPv6/IPv6

1.4.  DHCPv6+DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   In this approach, the configuration of IPv4 address and source ports
   (if required) is carried out using DHCPv6 as described in section 1.3
   above.  Any additional IPv4 configuration parameters which are
   required are then provisioned using a DHCPv4 messages transported
   within IPv6 in the configured softwire in the same manner as any
   other IPv4 based traffic.  Broadcast based DHCPv4 DHCPDISCOVER
   messages (necessary for IPv4 address assignment) can not be
   transported as they are not compatible with the softwire
   architecture.

   On receipt at the tunnel concentrator (e.g. MAP Border Router or a
   Lightweight 4over6 lwAFTR), the DHCPv4 message removed from the
   softwire and forwarded to the DHCPv4 server in the same way as any
   other IPv4 packet is handled.

   As the client is already configured with its external IPv4 address
   and source ports (using DHCPv6 or a well-known IPv4 address for DS-
   Lite clients), the messages exchanged between the DHCPv4 client and
   server would be strictly DHCPINFORM/DHCPACK messages, for the
   configuration of additional IPv4 parameters.

   For this approach to function, a mechanism for the DHCPv4 client to
   learn the IPv4 address of the DHCPv4 server is needed.  This could be
   done by defining a well-known IPv4 address for the DHCPv4 server,
   implementing a DHCPv4 relay function within the tunnel concentrator
   or other configuration methods.

   From a transport perspective, the key difference between this method
   and DHCPv4o6 (described above) is that here, the DHCPv4 message is
   put into UDPv4 and IPv4 and then put into the IPv6 softwire, instead
   of directly placing the DHCPv4 message into UDPv6 and IPv6.

   Currently, this approach is only theoretical and does not have a
   corresponding Internet Draft providing more detail.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6     September 2013


   The protocol stack used for obtaining an IPv4 address and source
   ports (if required) is as follows:

   DHCPv6/UDPv6/IPv6

   The protocol stack used for obtaining additional IPv4 configuration
   is as follows:

   DHCPv4/UDPv4/IPv4/IPv6

1.5.  DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning - Functional Overview

   [I-D.troan-dhc-dhcpv4osw] describes a method for complete client
   configuration using DHCPv4 transported across a broadcast capable
   link layer transport, such as a softwire.  This differs from
   DHCPv6+DHCPv4oSW in that it could support all DHCPv4 message types
   and is not limited to just DHCPINFORM/DHCPACK messages.  This means
   that it can be used for the assignment of IPv4 addresses as well as
   other DHCPv4 options.

   This functions by running a DHCPv4 client on the link layer interface
   (e.g. the softwire tunnel interface).  As the link layer must support
   broadcasts, DHCPDISCOVER and other broadcast DHCPv4 messages can be
   supported.  The DHCPv4 message flow is then the same as described in
   section 3.1 of [RFC2131].

   In this approach, either the tunnel concentrator must also be the
   DHCPv4 server or it must act as a DHCPv4 relay so that the broadcast
   DHCPDISCOVER/DHCPREQUEST messages can be decapsulated and forwarded
   to the DHCPv4 server.  If it is functioning as a relay, then the
   DHCPv4 Relay Information Option (option 82) is used to convey the
   client's source IPv6 address.  This is also used by the relay for
   routing return DHCPv4 packets.

   The DHCPv4oSW client may be configured with a shared IPv4 address
   with restricted layer 4 source ports.  This will normally exclude the
   well-known TCP/UDP ports in the range 0-1023, so the DHCPv4oSW client
   must be updated to source BOOTP/DHCP requests from a port taken from
   the range allocated to the client instead of UDP port 67.  Likewise,
   the DHCPv4oSW server must use the L4 source port from a client's
   message as the destination port for the response.

   The protocol stack used for obtaining DHCPv4 based configuration is:

   DHCPv4/UDPv4/IPv4/IPv6

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6     September 2013


   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] describes the transport of DHCPv4
   messages within two new DHCPv6 messages types: BOOTREQUESTV6 and
   BOOTREPLYV6.  These messages types must be implemented in both the
   DHCPv4oDHCPv6 client and server.

   In this approach, the configuration of stateless IPv4 addresses and
   source ports (if required) is carried out using DHCPv6 as described
   in section 1.3 above.  Dynamic IPv4 addressing, and/or any additional
   IPv4 configuration, is provided using DHCPv4 messages carried
   (without IPv4/UDPv4 headers) within a new OPTION_BOOTP_MSG DHCPv6
   option.

   OPTION_BOOTP_MSG enables the client and server to send BOOTP/DHCPv4
   messages verbatim across the IPv6 network.  When a DHCPv4oDHCPv6
   server receives a DHCPv6 request containing OPTION_BOOT_MSG within a
   BOOTREQUESTV6 message, it passes it to the DHCPv4 server engine.
   Likewise, the DHCPv4 server place its DHCPv4 response in the payload
   of OPTION_BOOTP_MSG and puts this into a BOOTPRPLYV6 message.

   As the DHCPv4 messages are carried within DHCPv6 multicast messages,
   using the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers, they can be relayed in
   exactly the same way as any other DHCPv6 multicasted message.
   Optionally, DHCPv6 relays could be updated so that they forward the
   BOOTREQUESTV6 message to a different destination address, allowing
   for the separation of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 provisioning infrastructure.

   The protocol stack used for obtaining dynamic v4 addressing or
   additional IPv4 configuraion is as follows:

   DHCPv4/DHCPv6/UDPv6/IPv6

2.  Requirements for the Solution Evaluation

   The following requirements have been defined for the evalution of the
   different approaches:

   1.  Minimize the amount of work necessary to implement the solution
       through re-use of existing standards and implementations as much
       as possible.

   2.  Provide a method of supporting all DHCPv4 options so that they
       can be utilised without the need for further standardation.

   3.  Allow for the dynamic leasing of IPv4 addresses to clients.  This
       allows for more efficient use of limited IPv4 resources.

   4.  Enable the separation of IPv4 and IPv6 host configuration
       infrastructure, i.e. independent DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6     September 2013


3.1.  DHCPv6 Based Provisioning

3.1.1.  Pros

   1.  Simpler, in that no additional functional elements are required
       except the DHCPv6 client and server.

   2.  A single protocol is used to deliver configuration information
       for IPv4 and IPv6.

   3.  A single provisioning point for all configuration parameters.

   4.  Implementations already exist, proving that the approach works.

3.1.2.  Cons

   1.  Any required DHCPv4 options must be ported to DHCPv6, which will
       require re-development work for each option.  All functional
       elements in the DHCPv6 implementation (clients, servers, relays)
       would need to be updated for each change.

   2.  Means that DHCPv4 'legacy' options, which will be of decreasing
       relevance in the future will remain in DHCPv6 for the lifetime of
       the protocol.

   3.  Each time that a DHCPv4 option is ported to DHCPv6, all clients
       and servers would need to be updated to implement the new option.

   4.  Does not provide an architecture for keeping IPv4 and IPv6
       domains separated.

   5.  Does not provide a mechanism for dynamic IPv4 address leasing.  A
       DHCPv4 lease lifetime management mechanism would need to be added
       to DHCPv6 for this.

3.2.  DHCPv4o6 Based Provisioning

3.2.1.  Pros

   1.  Implemention makes all existing DHCPv4 options available with no
       further ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  IPv4 and IPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each other
       if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

   3.  Easy to implement through minor adaptation of existing DHCPv4
       client, relay and server code.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6     September 2013


   4.  Simple, in that no additional functional elements are necessary
       except the DHCPv4o6 client relay and server.  If a TSV is used,
       then the TRA is not required.

   5.  Suitable for the provisioning of dynamic IPv4 configuration as
       the existing DHCPv4 leasing mechanism can be used.

   6.  Implementations already exist, proving that the approach works.

3.2.2.  Cons

   1.  More complex, in that there are more new functional elements
       (CRA, DHCPv4o6 server and optionally TRA) within the architecture
       than are necessary in DHCPv6 based provisioning.

   2.  A new DHCPv6 option is necessary in order to provision the IPv6
       address of the DHCPv4 server to the end device.

   3.  The DHCPv4 client host needs to be updated to implement the IPv6
       encapsulation and decapsulation function (i.e An HCRA).
       Otherwise a separate On-Link CRA (LCRA) functional element must
       be deployed.

   4.  A DHCPv4 server must be deployed and maintained.

   5.  The DHCPv4 server needs to be updated to implement new DHCPv4o6
       functionality.

3.3.  DHCPv6+DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning

3.3.1.  Pros

   1.  Once implemented, all existing DHCPv4 options will be be
       available with no further ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  Uses the existing DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 architectures in order to
       provide IPv4 configuration in an IPv6 only environment.

   3.  DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each
       other if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

3.3.2.  Cons

   1.  More complex, in that there are more new functional elements
       within the architecture than are necessary in DHCPv6 based
       provisioning.

Internet-Draft     Provisioning IPv4 Config Over IPv6     September 2013


   2.  IPv4 over IPv6 softwire approaches that distribute NAT to the CPE
       and allow for IP address sharing (MAP-E & LW4o6) forbid the use
       of reserved TCP/UDP ports (e.g. 0-1024).  Every DHCPv4 client
       sharing the same address needs to have a UDP listener running on
       UDP port 68.  To resolve this would require significant rework to
       either the softwire mechanisms and/or the DHCPv4 client
       implementatioIn.

   3.  From the current specification, DHCPINFORM is not suitable for
       use over a softwire.  Additional work, such as the development of
       'shims' would be necessary

   4.  The current DHCPINFORM specification has a number of unclear
       points, such as those described in
       [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpinform-clarify].  Substantial work would be
       required to resolve this.

   5.  Links the deployment of IPv4 configuration over IPv6 to a
       softwire implementation (e.g. requiring a softwire concentrator
       to act as a DHCPv4 relay).  Whilst softwires are the only
       application for this functionality at the moment, this may not
       always be the case.

   6.  A new mechanism must be defined in order to provide the DHCPv4
       client with the IPv4 address of the DHCPv4 server so that unicast
       DHCPINFORM messages can be sent.

   7.  As only DHCPINFORM/DHCPACK DHCPv4 message types are supported,
       dynamic IPv4 address leasing (using DHCPDISCOVER messages) can
       not be used.

   8.  Restricted to underlying hub-and-spoke IPv4 over IPv6
       architectures.  The 'hub' is necessary for the location of the
       DHCPv4 relay, as all traffic.  An underlying mesh architecture
       does not have such a location to deploy the relay.

   9.  The approach is unproven as no existing implementations exist.

3.4.  DHCPv4oSW Based Provisioning

3.4.1.  Pros

   1.  Once implemented, all existing DHCPv4 options will be be
       available with no further ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  Uses the existing DHCPv4 architecture in order to provide IPv4
       configuration in an IPv6 only environment.

   3.  DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each
       other if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

3.4.2.  Cons

   1.  Requires the DHCPv4 client, DHCPv4 server and softwire
       concentrator (or other relaying device) to be modified.

   2.  Requires the DHCPv4 client and server to be updated to use
       dynamic ports taken from the restricted port set allocated to the
       client instead of the well-known DHCPv4 ports.

   3.  The DHCPv4 client must be modified to identify the properties of
       the interface it is configuring and request parameters
       accordingly (e.g. restricted port-sets cannot be used on Ethernet
       transport interfaces but are allowed for a softwire transport)

   4.  May not be suitable for configuring translation based approaches
       (e.g. MAP-T)

   5.  Restricted to underlying hub-and-spoke IPv4 over IPv6
       architectures.  The 'hub' is necessary for the location of the
       DHCPv4 relay, as all traffic, including DHCPDISCOVER messages
       will pass through it.  An underlying mesh architecture does not
       have such a location to deploy the relay.

3.5.  DHCPv4oDHCPv6 Based Provisioning

3.5.1.  Pros

   1.  Once implemented, all existing DHCPv4 options will be be
       available with no further ongoing development work necessary.

   2.  Uses the existing DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 architectures in order to
       provide IPv4 configuration in an IPv6 only environment.

   3.  DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 based provisioning can be separated from each
       other if required, allowing flexibility in network design.

   4.  Suitable for the provisioning of dynamic IPv4 configuration as
       the existing DHCPv4 leasing mechanism can be used.

3.5.2.  Cons

   1.  More complex, in that there are more new functional elements
       within the architecture than are necessary in DHCPv6 based
       provisioning.

   2.  DHCPv6 clients needs to be updated to implement the new DHCPv6
       message types (BOOTPREQUESTv6 and BOOTPREPLYv6).

   3.  The DHCPv6 server needs to be updated to implement new
       DHCPv4oDHCPv6 message types and functionality.

   4.  The approach is currently unproven as no existing implementations
       exist.

4.  Conclusion

   Whilst all of the approaches described here will require some
   development work in order to realize, it is clear from the above
   analysis that the most sustainable approach capitalizes on existing
   DHCPv4 implementations and include them as new DHCPv6 message types.
   The main rationale for this is that it enables all of DHCPv4's
   existing options to be migrated for use over IPv6 in a single step.

   Porting of all necessary DHCPv4 options to DHCPv6 would require
   ongoing development work, re-implementing existing DHCPv4
   functionality in DHCPv6.  This will result in having legacy DHCPv4
   options in DHCPv6, which will no longer be useful once IPv4 is
   completely abandoned.

   Therefore, the DHCPv6 approach is not suitable for delivering IPv4
   configuration parameters in an efficient, ongoing manner.

   The dynamic leasing of IPv4 addresses is fundamental to the efficient
   use of remaining IPv4 resources.  This will become increasingly
   important in the future, so a mechanism which supports this is
   necessary.  DHCPv4oSW does not provide this function and so is not
   recommended.

   The DHCPv4o6 approach requires a DHCPv4 server (with DHCPv4o6
   functionality) for all deployment scenarios, even when DHCPv4
   specific functionality (e.g. sending DHCPv4 options) is not required
   by the operator.

   Therefore, this memo recommends DHCPv4oDHCPv6
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] as the best underlying approach for
   provisioning IPv4 parameters over an IPv6 only network.

6.  Security Considerations

   The following sections provide pointers to the documented security
   considerations associated with each approach.

6.1.  DHCPv4oIPv6

   Security considerations associated with this approach are described
   in Section 8 of [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6].

6.2.  DHCPv6

   Security considerations associated with this approach are described
   in Section 23 of [RFC3315].

6.3.  DHCPv6+DHCPv4oSW

   There is currently no document describing this mechanism, so no
   security considerations have been documented.

6.4.  DHCPv4oSW

   At the time of writing,[I-D.troan-dhc-dhcpv4osw] does not list any
   security considerations.

6.5.  DHCPv4oDHCPv6

   Security considerations associated with this approach are described
   in Section 10 of [RFC3315].
