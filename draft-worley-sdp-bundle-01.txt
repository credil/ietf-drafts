Kumquat: A Generic Bundle Mechanism for the Session Description Protocol
                                 (SDP)
                       draft-worley-sdp-bundle-01

Abstract

   This document defines a generic bundle mechanism for the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) by which the media described by a number
   of media descriptions ("m= lines") are multiplexed and transmitted
   over a single transport association.  The transport association is
   described by an additional media description, allowing SDP attributes
   to be applied to the aggregate, independently of attributes applied
   to the constituents.  In offer/answer usage, the bundle mechanism is
   backward compatible with SDP processors that do not understand the
   mechanism.  The mechanism is designed to be compatible with the
   limitations of the existing Internet infrastructure.

Internet-Draft            Kumquat SDP Bundling             February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The central idea of bundling is to multiplex the media that would be
   several RTP sessions into one RTP session, with particular emphasis
   on allowing one transport association to carry media that are
   presented to the higher, application layer, as multiple RTP sessions.

   At the interface between the SDP-configured layer and the lower,
   transport layer, the media are organized into a single RTP session.
   The transport-related properties of the RTP session (e.g., transport
   5-tuple, encryption, ICE) are described by the transport-related
   attributes of a single media description.

   At the interface between the SDP-configured layer and the higher,
   application layer, the media are organized into several RTP sessions.
   The application-related properties of the RTP session (e.g., media
   type and label) are described by the application-related attributes
   of separate media descriptions.

   (There are some attributes (e.g., bandwidth limitation) that can
   apply separately to both the bundled RTP session and the constituent
   RTP sessions.)

   However, we do not include the payload type numbers as information
   available to the application; only the encoding name and its
   parameters are accessible to the application.  This gives the bundle
   mechanism freedom to place constraints on the use of payload types.

   The bundle is signaled in the session description by a "group"
   attribute with semantics "KUMQUAT".  The first media description
   listed in the group is the "fusion" media description (MD), whose
   transport information describes the transport association via which
   the RTP packets will be sent.  The remaining (zero or more) media
   descriptions listed in the group are the "constituent" MDs.  RTP
   packets received from the applications for these MDs are encapsulated
   and sent on the transport association for the fusion MD.  RTP packets
   received from the transport association for the fusion MD are
   deencapsulated and sent to the applications for the constituent MDs.

   A new payload type (codec) named "kumquat" is defined to be used for
   this encapsulation.  Section 5.4.1

   In offer/answer usage, we must arrange that the bundle mechanism is
   backward compatible with entities that do not understand the bundle
   mechanism.  This requirement drives many features of this solution.
   Section 6.1

   In addition, many devices in current usage (especially SBCs) apply

   more restrictions on the usage of SDP than one would expect from
   abstract consideration of their roles in the network.  Some features
   of this solution are constructed to avoid these restrictions.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [rfc2119].

   The important RFCs in this area use inconsistent terminology.  Here,
   we use:

   - "transport association" and "5-tuple"

   A 5-tuple is the description of a particular transport association,
   such as a TCP connection.  The components of the 5-tuple are the
   identity of the protocol being used and the addresses and transport
   ports of the two endpoints.

   - "media"

   We use this term for (1) media content, considered in an abstract
   way, that is, without consideration of its particular encoding or the
   framing information around it, and (2) the particular bits and bytes
   used to encode and transmit the abstract media content.

   - "multimedia session"

   We use this term for the totality of the media that is transmitted/
   received as described by a particular session description (i.e., SDP
   instance).  This is taken from RFC 4566 section 2.

   - "RTP session"

   We use this term for the totality of the media that is transmitted/
   received as described by a particular media description (i.e., m=
   line) in a particular session description.  Since each media
   description specifies one 5-tuple, RTP sessions correspond to
   transport associations.  This is taken from RFC 3550 section 2.2.
   (In SIP usage (RFC 3264), this is called a "media stream", which term
   is used in RTP usage to refer to the RTP with a single SSRC.)

   It is understood that the RTP session can be dissected into "media
   streams" that have separate SSRCs, but that is not relevant in this
   analysis.  E.g., in SIP telephony, various activities of the far
   endpoint can cause the ultimate source of the audio (and hence the
   SSRC) to change dynamically, but each new source stands in for the
   previous one seamlessly in the user interface.

   (However, there is a way (RFC 4566 section 5.14) for an m= line to
   specify a set of ports and thus a set of related RTP sessions.  We do

   not address that.)

   In general, further agreed terminology is needed to describe the
   aggregate of media possessing a particular SSRC, etc., but that is
   not needed for this discussion.

3.  Desiderata

   This section lists desiderata for the bundle mechanism in SDP.  (I
   use the term "desiderata" -- "things that are desired" -- rather than
   "requirements", because we may discover that we can't optimally
   satisfy all of these criteria at the same time.)  The first section
   lists desiderata that are arise from considering the ways
   applications may wish to bundling.  The second section lists
   desiderata that arise from compatibility with existing Internet
   infrastructure.

3.1.  Feature Desiderata

   DES F1: For each bundle, there is a group of media descriptions which
   describe the application-level RTP sessions.

   DES F2: For each bundle, there is a media description that describes
   the transport-level RTP session.

   F1 and F2 do not specify whether the transport-level media
   description may or may not also be one of the application-level media
   descriptions.

   DES F3: There must be a uniform way to deal with new SDP parameters,
   so that new SDP parameters do not require a specific updating of the
   bundling procedures.

   (This desideratum is taken from slides-interim-2013-rtcweb-1-10.pdf.)

   DES F4: Bundles may contain other bundles as constituents.

   Of course, no bundle may directly or indirectly contain itself.  (I
   don't expect any current implementation to implement bundles within
   bundles, but we should design the mechanism to allow this, as some
   day we will likely need it.)

   DES F5: A bundle may contain zero constituents.

   A bundle with no constituents serves no purpose for the transport of
   media, but we are likely to someday need to describe such a bundle.
   (Compare that an SDP m= line is syntactically constrained to specify
   at least one payload type.  When SDP was used only to specify
   multicast sessions, this constraint was common sense.  But once SDP
   offer/answer was invented, when a media description was rejected, the
   natural representation would be an m= line with a zero port and no
   payload types.  But a payload type was syntactically required, so we
   now have to provide at least one token payload type in rejected m=
   lines.)

Internet-Draft            Kumquat SDP Bundling             February 2013


   DES F6: If an answerer that does understand the bundle mechanism
   processes an offer that contains a bundle, it must be able to (1)
   accept the bundle and selectively accept or reject each constituent
   RTP session within it, (2) reject the bundle as a whole, or (3)
   reject the bundling and selectively accept or reject each constituent
   RTP session as separate RTP sessions.

   Presumably answer (3) is like that which would be produced by an
   answerer that does not understand the bundle mechanism.  It is a
   lower priority that the answerer can distinguish between accepting
   the bundle while rejecting all of its constituents, and rejecting the
   bundle as a whole.  But those two conditions differ conceptually
   regarding whether any "framing" actions of the bundle are performed.

   DES F7: There must be a reliable way to demultiplex incoming RTP into
   the separate application-level RTP sessions.  Similarly, there must
   be a reliable way to demultiplex the associated RTCP information.

   The RTCP information for each media stream is tagged with the SSRC
   about which it reports, and the SSRC is used to correlate the RTCP
   reports with the RTP sessions containing media with the same SSRC.
   So this desideratum appears to be straightforward to satisfy.

   DES F8: The specification must specify any needed additional
   procedures for handling SSRC collisions between media sources within
   different application-level RTP sessions, as those can now collide.

   In the terminology of RFC 3550, the constituent media descriptions
   are now part of one RTP session.

   DES F9: When bundling is used, the number of TURN relays needed is
   reduced.  When an offer is constructed, the offerer must not need to
   pre-allocate TURN relays for constituent media descriptions.  When
   both endpoints support bundling, the mechanism must not require the
   offerer to allocate TURN relays for constituent media descriptions.

   (This desideratum was suggested by Andrew Hutton.)

   DES F10: It must be possible to add and remove one way video flows
   within the bundle without requiring an additional offer/answer cycle.

   (This desideratum is taken from slides-interim-2013-rtcweb-1-10.pdf.)
   Presumably this can be accomplished as it is now, with a single media
   description carrying multiple video flows that are distinguished only
   by their SSRCs.

3.2.  Compatibility Desiderata

   DES C1: In offer/answer usage, an endpoint using the bundle mechanism
   must interwork correctly with an endpoint that does not understand
   the bundle mechanism.  Interworking must continue when endpoints are
   replaced with other endpoints during a sequence of offer/answer
   exchanges (such as happens in 3PCC or call transfers "behind an
   SBC").

   DES C2: Avoid using media types in m= lines other than audio and
   video, as some SBCs reject SDP that uses other media types.

   (This desideratum was suggested by Hadriel Kaplan.)

   DES C3: Any additional m= lines prescribed by the bundle mechanism
   should be physically after the constituent m= lines.

   Many devices that have only one audio or video channel accept the
   first m= line with that media type and reject any further ones

   non-DES C4: SBCs generally pass through attributes that they do not
   understand.  SBCs generally pass through codec specifications that
   they do not understand, even if they are configured to transcode
   certain specific codecs.

   (This desideratum was suggested by Hadriel Kaplan.)

   DES C5: After offer/answer processing is finished, if the exchanged
   SDP is examined by a non-supporting SBC, the set of transport
   associations that it sees being specified for media exchange should
   be the set that are actually used for media transfer.

   (This desideratum was suggested by Hadriel Kaplan.)  This is needed
   because SBCs monitor the packet traffic on the transport associations
   and if no media is seen on one of the associations for a significant
   period of time, the SBC will tear down the call.

   DES C6: In a session description, no endpoint of a transport
   association (i.e., address/port) may be used multiple times.

   (This desideratum was suggested by Cullen Jennings.)  Such
   duplication is not defined by [sdp].  Some SBCs do not support such
   duplication (ultimately, because it was not supported by [RFC 2327]),
   and they reject SDP specifying duplicated transport association
   endpoints.

   DES C7: Offer/answer processing between supporting processors must be
   completed in one exchange.  When interworking between supporting and

   non-supporting processors, it is less desirable but admissible that a
   second offer/answer exchange may be needed to complete configuring
   the multimedia session.

4.  Tutorial Examples

   This section is non-normative.  (This section was suggested by
   Charles Eckel.)

   This is an introduction to SDP bundling via a series of examples of
   offer/answer processing.  Some mandatory SDP lines have been omitted
   from the examples for brevity.  Long SDP lines have been folded by
   using trailing backslashes.  Blank lines have been inserted for
   clarity.

4.1.  One Audio Stream and One Video Stream

4.1.1.  Offer without Bundling

   Here is a typical, non-bundled SDP example with both audio and video
   media:

          o=- 2890844526 2890844526 IN IP4 host.example.com
          c=IN IP4 10.0.1.1

  This SDP media description ("MD") provides the transport information
  about the audio and also identifies the role of the audio from the
  application's point of view.  In this case, the fact that it is the
  first audio m= line suffices to tell the application how to treat it.
  In more complex cases, label or content attributes might be used to
  communicate the proper handling to the application.

          m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 0 8 97
          a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000

              raddr 10.0.1.1 rport 10001

  This MD provides the transport information about the video and also
  identifies the role of the video from the application's point of view.

          m=video 10002 RTP/AVP 31 32
          a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000

              raddr 10.0.1.1 rport 10003

   We call the RTP that is described by each media description (MD) the
   media describee (MDee).  The audio and video are carried in separate
   MDees, which each have a separate transport association.

4.1.2.  Offer with Bundling

   With SDP bundling, we add an additional MD to describe a single
   "fusion" MDee to carry both the audio and video information, and a
   group attribute to show the association of the fusion MD with the
   constituent MDs:

          o=- 2890844526 2890844526 IN IP4 host.example.com
          c=IN IP4 10.0.1.1

  Declare which MDs are included in the multiplexed MD:  mid:con1 and
  mid:con2 are the constituent MDs whose MDees (from the application
  point of view) will be carried by the MDee of the first-designed MD,
  mid:fuse, which is the fusion MD.

          a=group:KUMQUAT fuse con1 con2

  This MD provides the application-level description of the audio MDee.
  As in the previous example, it is the first audio m= line.  It
  includes any attributes which apply to the audio media from the
  application point of view, including the payload type definitions.
  When interpreted by a supporting processor, the transport information
  is ignored.  When interpreted by a non-supporting processor, the
  transport information specifies that the MDee exists but is currently
  "on hold":  the association address is null, and the association port
  is 9, the discard port.

          m=audio 9 RTP/AVP 0 8 97
          c=IN IP4 0.0.0.0
          a=mid:con1
          a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
          a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000
          a=rtpmap:97 iLBC/8000

  This MD provides the application-level description of the video MDee.
  As in the previous example, it is the first video m= line.  It
  includes any attributes which apply to the video media from the

  This MD provides the transport information for the fusion MDee,
  including any attributes which apply to the transport.  In this case,
  ICE candidates are provided for both the RTP and RTCP streams.  The MD
  is artificially given the media type "audio" (which is ugly, but
  avoids rejection by SBCs) and it is placed after all of the
  constituent MDs so as to not affect their positions as "first audio
  MD", etc.  The MD lists a single payload type for the "kumquat"
  payload format, which is used to encapsulate the RTP of the
  constituent MDees.

   If this SDP bundle is accepted, RTP provided by the application for
   the audio MDee will be encapsulated into a kumquat payload and then
   be sent from port 10000.  The encapsulation also contains the ordinal
   index (i.e., 0) of the audio MDee and the payload type of the
   original audio RTP.  RTP provided by the application for the video
   MDee will be encapsulated into a kumquat payload and then be sent
   from port 10000.  The encapsulation also contains the ordinal index
   (i.e., 1) of the video MDee and the payload type of the original
   video RTP.

   RTP that is received on port 10000 is interpreted according to the
   kumquat payload format: The constituent MD ordinal index is
   extracted.  The encapsulated RTP and its payload type are then
   interpreted according to the constituent MD.

4.1.3.  Answer from an Answerer that Supports Bundling

   If the answerer supports SDP bundling, and desires to accept the
   offered bundle and its constituent MDs, the answerer signals that it
   accepts the SDP bundling by providing a matching group:KUMQUAT
   attribute in the answer.  As always in offer/answer, the MDs in the
   answer correspond to the MDs in the offer by ordinal position.

   The answerer provides the necessary transport information for the
   fusion MD.  The answerer understands that MDs mid:con1 and mid:con2
   are incorporated into MD mid:fuse, and ignores their transport
   information.  It accepts each constituent MD by providing an answer
   MD for each of them that specifies a null address and port 9 (the
   discard port).

   SDP bundling allows for backward compatibility in case the answerer
   does not understand bundling.  If the answerer does not understand

  The fusion MD is rejected by the answerer because the only offered
  codec was kumquat, and the answerer does not implement it.

          m=audio 0 RTP/AVP 127

   Because the group attribute is not present in the response, the
   offerer knows that the answerer does not support bundling (or does
   not want to consider the offered bundle).  The offerer knows that the
   answerer wants to establish one audio MDee and one video MDee, and
   formally, that has been done.  But the offerer has not set up its
   transport for separate audio and video MDees and has not signaled its
   transport information for those MDees to the answerer.

   In order to enable media flow, the offerer sends an updated offer

4.2.  Two Audio Streams and Two Video Streams

   In this example, a presentation involves four media roles: the
   speaker's audio, the floor microphone, the video of the speaker, and
   the video of the speaker's slides.  We use separate MDs for each
   media stream because each MDee has a different role; the application
   will handle each of them in distinctly different ways.

4.3.  Virtual Classroom with One Audio Stream, Two Video Streams, and a
      Group of Video Streams

   This example is the teacher's connection to a virtual classroom
   server.  The media descriptions are tagged using the "content"
   attribute.  [RFC 4796] The media comprises:

   1. one audio channel, for sending the teacher's voice and receiving
   the voice of a selected student

   2. one video channel, for sending the teacher's presentation

   3. one video channel, for sending the teacher's face

   4. one video channel, for receiving a dynamically varying set of
   students' faces

   The fourth MDee (for students' faces) contains a large and variable
   set of video captures.  These can be handled by a single MDee because
   they all have essentially similar roles -- the application will
   process them as a set.  As Adam Roach would say, "no control surfaces
   are necessary to talk about and/or manipulate the individual
   streams".  In particular, this allows a large number of captures to
   be handled without mentioning them in the SDP, at the expense of not
   allowing the SDP to describe any of them individually.  Similarly,
   the number of captures can vary without having to renegotiate the
   SDP.

   (In contrast, the third MDee (the teacher's face) is a separate MDee
   because it is processed in a different role than that of the
   students' faces.)

   In unbundled usage, there would be one transport association for the
   fourth MDee.  Incoming RTP from that association would be
   demultiplexed by the application based on the SSRC values, which
   would be unique for each student.  With bundling, once the single
   transport MDee is demultiplexed based on the ordinal index in the
   kumquat encapsulation, deencapsulated RTP packets destined for the

5.4.  Multiplexing and Demultiplexing Media Streams

   SDP bundling uses a payload type named "kumquat" to encapsulate the
   RTP packets of several constituent MDees into RTP packets of one
   MDee.  Each constituent MDee has a distinct index value in the range
   0 to 254 (inclusive).  When kumquat is used within SDP bundling, the
   index value is the ordinal index of the MD within the session
   description.  (The indexes start with 0 for the first MD.)

   When the application delivers a payload (and associated descriptive
   information such as SSRC) in the context of a constituent MD to be
   transmitted, it is encapsulated into a kumquat payload and the
   kumquat payload is transmitted using the transport association of the
   fusion MD.

   When a kumquat payload arrives on the transport association of the
   fusion MD, the kumquat payload is interpreted to construct a payload
   (and associated descriptive information).  That payload is delivered
   to the application in the context of the constituent MD identified by
   the index value.

5.4.1.  The "kumquat" Payload Format

   The format of a kumquat protocol payload contains a four-octet fixed
   part followed by zero or more CSRC identifiers, header extension, and
   the encapsulated payload.  Note that this diagram is of the kumquat
   payload only, and does not include the RTP header before the payload.

   V: This field contains the value 2.

   0 (bit 2): This field contains the value 0.

   X: If this field is 1, the extension field is present.

   CC: This field contains the count of the number of CSRC identifiers
   that follow the fixed part.

   M: This field contains the "marker" bit associated with the
   encapsulated payload.

   PT: This field contains the payload type number associated with the
   encapsulated payload.  The meaning of PT is defined by the MDee
   identified by the index field.

   index: This field contains the index value identifying the
   constituent MDee that the encapsulated payload is associated with.
   The range of index values is 0 to 254 (inclusive).  The value 255 is
   reserved for further standardization and MUST NOT be used.

   0 (bits 24 to 31): This field is reserved for further
   standardization.  It MUST be set to 0 when the payload is created and
   MUST be ignored when the payload is interpreted.

   contributing source (CSRC) identifiers: This variable-length field
   contains the four-octet CSRC identifiers associated with the
   encapsulated payload.  The number of CSRC identifiers is given by the
   CC field.

   extension: This variable-length field is present only if the X field
   is 1.  If it is present, its format is the same as the extension
   field of the RTP header.  In particular, its length is always a

   multiple of four octets.

   encapsulated payload: This variable-length field contains the payload
   of the payload type specified by the PT field (interpreted in the
   context of the constituent MD identified by the index field).

   There is no defined meaning for the RTP marker bit in association
   with a kumquat payload.  (Note that this is the marker bit in the RTP
   header that precedes the kumquat payload, not the M field of the
   kumquat payload itself.)  Its value MUST be 0.

   The kumquat payload represents an RTP packet containing the following
   data:

      V: The V field is 2.

      P: The pad field is unspecified, because the need for padding is
      determined only when the RTP packet is considered in the context
      of the transport protocol.

      X, CC, M, PT: These fields are taken from the corresponding fields
      of the kumquat payload data.

      sequence number, timestamp, SSRC identifier: These fields are
      taken from the corresponding fields of RTP header before the
      kumquat payload.

      extension, CSRC identifiers: These fields are taken from the
      corresponding fields of the kumquat payload data.

      payload: This field is taken from the encapsulated payload field
      of the kumquat payload data.

   Graphically, the kumquat encoding sets up the following equivalence
   between an RTP packet of the constituent MDee and an RTP packet of
   the fusion MDee:

   RTP packet in the context of the fusion media description (with PT1
   specifying kumquat encoding):
