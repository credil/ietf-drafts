       464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation
                      draft-ietf-v6ops-464xlat-06

Abstract

   This document describes an architecture (464XLAT) for providing
   limited IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only network by combining
   existing and well-known stateful protocol translation RFC 6146 in the
   core and stateless protocol translation RFC 6145 at the edge. 464XLAT
   is a simple and scalable technique to quickly deploy limited IPv4
   access service to IPv6-only edge networks without encapsulation.

Internet-Draft                   464XLAT                     August 2012


1.  Introduction

   The IANA unallocated IPv4 address pool was exhausted on February 3,
   2011.  Each RIR's unallocated IPv4 address pool will exhaust in the
   near future.  It will be difficult for many networks to assign IPv4
   addresses to end users, despite substantial IP connectivity growth
   required for fast growing edge networks.

   This document describes an IPv4 over IPv6 solution as one of the
   techniques for IPv4 service extension and encouragement of IPv6
   deployment. 464XLAT is not a one for one replacement of full IPv4
   functionality.  The 464XLAT architecture only supports IPv4 in the
   client server model, where the server has global IPv4 address.  This
   means it is not fit for IPv4 peer-to-peer communication or inbound
   IPv4 connections. 464XLAT builds on IPv6 transport and includes full
   any to any IPv6 communication.

   The 464XLAT architecture described in this document uses IPv4/IPv6
   translation standardized in [RFC6145] and [RFC6146].  It does not
   require DNS64 [RFC6147] since an IPv4 host may simply send IPv4
   packets, including packets to an IPv4 DNS server, which will be
   translated on the CLAT to IPv6 and back to IPv4 on the PLAT. 464XLAT
   networks may use DNS64 [RFC6147] to enable single stateful
   translation [RFC6146] instead of 464XLAT double translation where
   possible.  The 464XLAT architecture encourages IPv6 transition by
   making IPv4 services reachable across IPv6-only networks and
   providing IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity to single-stack IPv4 or IPv6
   servers and peers.

   By combining 464XLAT with BIH [RFC6535], it is also possible to
   provide single IPv4 to IPv6 translation service, which will be needed
   in the future case of IPv6-only servers and peers to be reached from
   legacy IPv4-only hosts across IPv6-only networks.


2.  BCP Scenario

   This BCP only applies when the following two criteria are present:

   1.  There is an IPv6-only access network that uses stateful
       translation [RFC6146]

   2.  There are IPv4-only applications or hosts that must communicate
       across the IPv6-only access network to reach the IPv4 Internet

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  Terminology

   PLAT:   PLAT is Provider side translator(XLAT) that complies with
           [RFC6146].  It translates N:1 global IPv6 packets to global
           IPv4 packets, and vice versa.

   CLAT:   CLAT is Customer side translator(XLAT) that complies with
           [RFC6145].  It algorithmically translates 1:1 private IPv4
           packets to global IPv6 packets, and vice versa.  The CLAT
           function is applicable to a router or an end-node such as a
           mobile phone.  CLAT SHOULD perform router function to
           facilitate packets forwarding through the stateless
           translation even if it is an end-node.  In the case where the
           access network does not allow for a dedicated IPv6 prefix for
           translation, a NAT44 SHOULD be used between the router
           function and the stateless translator function.  The CLAT as
           a common home router or 3G router is expected to perform
           gateway functions such as DHCP server and DNS proxy for local
           clients.  The CLAT does not comply with the sentence "Both
           IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses and IPv4-converted IPv6
           addresses SHOULD use the same prefix." that is described on
           Section 3.3 in [RFC6052] due to using different IPv6 prefixes
           for CLAT-side and PLAT-side IPv4 addresses.


5.  Motivation and Uniqueness of 464XLAT

   1.  Minimal IPv4 resource requirements, maximum IPv4 efficiency
       through statistical multiplexing

   2.  No new protocols required, quick deployment

   3.  IPv6-only networks are simpler and therefore less expensive to
       operate


6.  Network Architecture

   464XLAT architecture is shown in the following figure.

6.1.  Wireline Network Architecture

   The private IPv4 host on this diagram can reach global IPv4 hosts via
   translation on both CLAT and PLAT.  On the other hand, the IPv6 host
   can reach other IPv6 hosts on the Internet directly without
   translation.  This means that the CPE can not only have the function
   of CLAT but also the function of IPv6 native router for IPv6 native
   traffic.

6.2.  Wireless 3GPP Network Architecture

   The CLAT function on the UE provides an [RFC1918] address and IPv4
   default route.  The applications on the UE can use the private IPv4
   address for reaching global IPv4 hosts via translation on both CLAT
   and PLAT.  On the other hand, reaching IPv6 hosts (including host
   presented via DNS64 [RFC6147]) does not require the CLAT function on
   the UE.

7.  Applicability

7.1.  Wireline Network Applicability

   When an ISP has IPv6 464XLAT, the ISP can provide outgoing IPv4
   service to end users across an IPv6 access network.  The result is
   that edge network growth is no longer tightly coupled to the
   availability of scarce IPv4 addresses.

   If the IXP or another provider operates the PLAT, the edge ISP is
   only required to deploy an IPv6 access network.  All ISPs do not need
   IPv4 access networks.  They can migrate their access network to a
   simple and highly scalable IPv6-only environment.

   Incidentally, the effectiveness of 464XLAT was confirmed in the WIDE
   camp Spring 2012.  The result is described in

Internet-Draft                   464XLAT                     August 2012


   [I-D.hazeyama-widecamp-ipv6-only-experience].

7.2.  Wireless 3GPP Network Applicability

   The vast majority of mobile networks are compliant to Pre-Release 9
   3GPP standards.  In Pre-Release 9 3GPP networks, GSM and UMTS
   networks must signal and support both IPv4 and IPv6 Packet Data
   Protocol (PDP) attachments to access IPv4 and IPv6 network
   destinations [RFC6459].  Since there are 2 PDPs required to support 2
   address families, this is double the number of PDPs required to
   support the status quo of 1 address family, which is IPv4.

   464XLAT in combination with stateful translation [RFC6146] and DNS64
   [RFC6147] allows 85% of the Android applications to continue to work
   with single translation or native IPv6 access.  For the remaining 15%
   of applications that require IPv4 connectivity, the CLAT function on
   the UE provides a private IPv4 address and IPv4 default-route on the
   host for the applications to reference and bind to.  Connections
   sourced from the IPv4 interface are immediately routed to the CLAT
   function and passed to the IPv6-only mobile network, destine to the
   PLAT.  In summary, the UE has the CLAT function that does a stateless
   translation [RFC6145], but only when required.  The mobile network
   has a PLAT that does stateful translation [RFC6146].

   464XLAT works with today's existing systems as much as possible.
   464XLAT is compatible with existing network based deep packet
   inspection solutions like 3GPP standardized Policy and Charging
   Control (PCC) [TS.23203].


8.  Implementation Considerations

8.1.  IPv6 Address Format

   IPv6 address format in 464XLAT is defined in Section 2.2 of
   [RFC6052].

8.2.  IPv4/IPv6 Address Translation Chart

8.2.1.  Case of enabling only stateless XLATE on CLAT

   This case should be used when a prefix delegation mechanism such as
   DHCPv6-PD [RFC3633] is available to assign a dedicated translation
   prefix to the CLAT.

8.2.2.  Case of enabling NAT44 and stateless XLATE on CLAT

   This case should be used when a prefix delegation mechanism is not
   available to assign a dedicated translation prefix to the CLAT.  In
   this case, NAT44 SHOULD be used so that all IPv4 source addresses are
   mapped to a single IPv6 address.

8.3.  IPv6 Prefix Handling

8.3.1.  Case of enabling only stateless XLATE on CLAT

   From the delegated DHCPv6 [RFC3633] prefix, a /64 is dedicated to
   source and receive IPv6 packets associated with the stateless
   translation [RFC6145].

   The CLAT MAY discover the Pref64::/n of the PLAT via some method such
   as DHCPv6 option, TR-069, DNS APL RR [RFC3123] or
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic].

8.3.2.  Case of enabling NAT44 and stateless XLATE on CLAT

   In the case that DHCPv6-PD [RFC3633] is not available, the CLAT does
   not have dedicated IPv6 prefix for translation.  If the CLAT does not
   have a dedicated IPv6 prefix for translation, the CLAT can perform
   with NAT44 and stateless translation [RFC6145].

   Incoming source IPv4 packets from the LAN of [RFC1918] addresses are
   NAT44 to the CLAT IPv4 host address.  Then, the CLAT will do a
   stateless translation [RFC6145] so that the IPv4 packets from the
   CLAT IPv4 host address are translated to the CLAT WAN IPv6 address as
   described in [RFC6052].

   Its subnet prefix is made of the delegated prefix, completed if
   needed to a /64 by a subnet ID = 0.  Its interface ID is the 464XLAT
   interface ID (Section 10).

   The CLAT MAY discover the Pref64::/n of the PLAT via some method such
   as TR-069, DNS APL RR [RFC3123] or
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic].

8.4.  Traffic Treatment Scenarios

        |  IPv6  |    IPv4     | Stateless Translation |    CLAT     |
        +--------+-------------+-----------------------+-------------+

                        Traffic Treatment Scenarios

   The above chart shows most common traffic types and traffic
   treatment.

8.5.  DNS Proxy Implementation

   The CLAT SHOULD implement a DNS proxy as defined in [RFC5625].  The
   case of an IPv4-only node behind CLAT querying an IPv4 DNS server is
   undesirable since it requires both stateful and stateless translation
   for each DNS lookup.  The CLAT SHOULD set itself as the DNS server
   via DHCP or other means and proxy DNS queries for IPv4 and IPv6
   clients.  Using the CLAT enabled home router or UE as a DNS proxy is
   a normal consume gateway function and simplifies the traffic flow so
   that only IPv6 native queries are made across the access network.
   The CLAT SHOULD allow for a client to query any DNS server of its
   choice and bypass the proxy.

8.6.  CLAT in a Gateway

   The CLAT is a stateless translation feature which can be implemented
   in a common home router or mobile phone that has a mobile router
   feature.  The router with CLAT function SHOULD provide common router
   services such as DHCP of [RFC1918] addresses, DHCPv6, and DNS
   service.  The router SHOULD set itself as the DNS server advertised
   via DHCP or other means to the clients so that it may implement the
   DNS proxy function to avoid double translation of DNS request.

8.7.  CLAT to CLAT communications

   While CLAT to CLAT IPv4 communication may work when the client IPv4
   subnets do not overlap, this traffic flow is out of scope. 464XLAT is

   a hub and spoke architecture focused on enabling IPv4-only services
   over IPv6-only access networks.


9.  Deployment Considerations

   Even if the Internet access provider for consumers is different from
   the PLAT provider (e.g. another internet access provider), it can
   implement traffic engineering independently from the PLAT provider.
   Detailed reasons are below:

   1.  The Internet access provider for consumers can figure out IPv4
       destination address from translated IPv6 packet header, so it can
       implement traffic engineering based on IPv4 destination address
       (e.g. traffic monitoring for each IPv4 destination address,
       packet filtering for each IPv4 destination address, etc.).  The
       tunneling methods do not have such a advantage, without any deep
       packet inspection for processing the inner IPv4 packet of the
       tunnel packet.

   2.  If the Internet access provider for consumers can assign IPv6
       prefix greater than /64 for each subscriber, this 464XLAT
       architecture can separate IPv6 prefix for native IPv6 packets and
       XLAT prefix for IPv4/IPv6 translation packets.  Accordingly, it
       can identify the type of packets ("native IPv6 packets" and
       "IPv4/IPv6 translation packets"), and implement traffic
       engineering based on IPv6 prefix.

   This 464XLAT architecture has two capabilities.  One is a IPv4 ->
   IPv6 -> IPv4 translation for sharing global IPv4 addresses, another,
   if combined with BIH [RFC6535], is a IPv4 -> IPv6 translation for
   reaching IPv6-only servers from IPv4-only clients that can not
   support IPv6.  IPv4-only clients must be support through the long
   period of global transition to IPv6.


10.  Security Considerations

   To implement a PLAT, see security considerations presented in Section
   5 of [RFC6146].

   To implement a CLAT, see security considerations presented in Section
   7 of [RFC6145].  The CLAT MAY comply with [RFC6092].


11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to reserve a Modified EUI-64 identifier for 464XLAT

   according to section 2.2.2 of [RFC5342].  Its suggested value is 02-
   00-5E-00-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-0F-FF-FF-FF-FF or 02-00-5E-10-00-00-
   00-00 to 02-00-5E-EF-FF-FF-FF-FF, depending on whether it should be
   taken in reserved or available values.

Appendix A.  Examples of IPv4/IPv6 Address Translation

   The following are examples of IPv4/IPv6 Address Translation on the
   464XLAT architecture.

   Example 1.  (Case of enabling only stateless XLATE on CLAT)

   In the case that IPv6 prefix greater than /64 is assigned to end
   users by such as DHCPv6-PD [RFC3633], only the function of Stateless
   XLATE should be enabled on CLAT.  Because the CLAT can use dedicated
   a /64 from the assigned IPv6 prefix for Stateless XLATE.

   Example 2.  (Case of enabling NAT44 and stateless XLATE on CLAT)

   In the case that IPv6 prefix /64 is assigned to end users, the
   function of NAT44 and Stateless XLATE should be enabled on CLAT.
   Because the CLAT does not have dedicated IPv6 prefix for translation.
