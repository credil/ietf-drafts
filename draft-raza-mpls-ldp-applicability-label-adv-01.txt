Abstract 

   An LDP speaker negotiates the label advertisement mode with its LDP 
   peer at the time of session establishment. Although different 
   applications sharing the same LDP session may need different modes 
   of label distribution and advertisement, there is only one type of 
   label advertisement mode that is negotiated and used per LDP 
   session. This document clarifies the use and the applicability of 
   session's negotiated label advertisement mode, and categorizes LDP 
   applications into two broad categories of negotiated mode-bound and 
   mode-independent applications. This document proposal and 
   clarification thus updates [RFC5036] and [RFC4447].

Internet-Draft  Applicability of LDP Label Advertisement Mode July 2011 
 
    

1. Introduction 

   The MPLS architecture [RFC3031] defines two modes of label 
   advertisement for an LSR: 

     1. Downstream-on-Demand 

     2. Unsolicited Downstream 

   The "Downstream-on-Demand" mode requires an LSR to explicitly 
   request the label binding for FECs from its peer, whereas 
   "Unsolicited Downstream" mode allows an LSR to distribute the label 
   binding for FECs unsolicitedly to LSR peers that have not explicitly 
   requested them. The MPLS architecture [RFC3031] also specifies that 
   on any given label distribution adjacency, the upstream LSR and the 
   downstream LSR must agree to using a single label advertisement 
   mode.  

   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] allows label 
   advertisement mode negotiation at the session establishment time 
   (section 3.5.3 [RFC5036]). To comply with MPLS architecture, LDP 
   specification also dictates that only one label advertisement mode 
   is agreed and used on a given LDP session between two LSRs.  

   With the advent of new applications, such as L2VPN [RFC4447], mLDP 
   [MLDP], ICCP [ICCP], running on top of LDP, there are situations 
   when an LDP session is shared across more than one application to 
   exchange label bindings for different type of FECs. Although 
   different applications sharing the same LDP session may need 
   different type of label advertisement mode negotiated, there is only 
   one type of label advertisement mode that is negotiated and agreed 
   at the time of establishment of LDP session.  

   This document clarifies the use and the applicability of session's 
   label advertisement mode for each application using the session. It 
   also categorizes LDP applications into two broad categories of 
   negotiated mode-bound and mode-independent applications. This 
   document proposal and clarification thus updates [RFC5036] and 
   [RFC4447]. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft  Applicability of LDP Label Advertisement Mode July 2011 
 
   The unqualified term "mode" used in document refers to "label 
   advertisement mode".  

   Please also note that LDP specification [RFC5036] uses the term 
   "Downstream Unsolicited" to refer to "Unsolicited Downstream", as 
   well as uses the terms "label distribution" and "label 
   advertisement" interchangeably. This document also uses these 
   terms interchangeably.  

3. Label Advertisement Mode Applicability 

3.1. Label Advertisement Mode Negotiation 

   Label advertisement mode is negotiated between participating LSR 
   peers at the time of session establishment. The label advertisement 
   mode is specified in LDP Initialization message's "Common Session 
   Parameter" TLV by setting A-bit (Label Advertisement Discipline bit) 
   to 1 or 0 for Downstream-on-Demand or Downstream-Unsolicited modes 
   respectively [RFC5036]. The negotiation of the A-bit is specified in 
   section 3.5.3 of [RFC5036] as follows: 

     "If one LSR proposes Downstream Unsolicited and the other proposes 
     Downstream on Demand, the rules for resolving this difference is: 

       -  If the session is for a label-controlled ATM link or a label- 
     controlled Frame Relay link, then Downstream on Demand MUST be 
     used. 

       -  Otherwise, Downstream Unsolicited MUST be used." 

   Once label advertisement mode has been negotiated and agreed, both 
   LSRs must use the same mode for label binding exchange. 

3.2. LDP Applications Categorization 

   At the time of standardization of LDP base specification RFC-3036, 
   the earlier applications using LDP to exchange their FEC bindings 
   were: 

     .  Dynamic Label Switching for IP Prefixes 

     .  Label-controlled ATM/FR  

   Since then, several new applications have emerged that use LDP to 
   signal their FEC bindings and/or application data: 

     .  L2VPN P2P PW   ([RFC4447]) 

 
 
Raza, et. al             Expires January 2012                  [Page 4] 
    
Internet-Draft  Applicability of LDP Label Advertisement Mode July 2011 
 
     .  L2VPN P2MP PW  ([P2MP-PW]) 

     .  mLDP           ([MLDP]) 

     .  ICCP           ([ICCP]) 

   We divide these LDP applications into two broad categories from 
   label advertisement mode usage point of view: 

   1. Session mode-bound Applications (i.e. use the negotiated label 
     advertisement mode) 

   2. Session mode-independent Applications (i.e. do not care about the 
     negotiated label advertisement mode) 

3.2.1. Session mode-bound Applications 

  The FEC label binding exchange for such LDP applications MUST use the 
  negotiated label advertisement mode.  

   The early LDP applications "Dynamic Label Switching for IP Prefixes" 
   and "Label-controlled ATM/FR" fall into this category. 

3.2.2. Session mode-independent Applications 

   The FEC label binding, or any other application data, exchange for 
   such LDP applications does not care about, nor tied to the 
   negotiated label advertisement mode of the session; rather, the 
   information exchange is driven by the application need and 
   procedures as described by their respective specifications. For 
   example, [MLDP] specifies procedures to advertise P2MP FEC label 
   binding in an unsolicited manner, irrespective of the negotiated 
   label advertisement mode of the session. 

   The applications, PW (P2P and P2MP), MLDP, and ICCP, fall into this 
   category of LDP application. 

3.2.2.1. Upstream Label Assignment 

  As opposed to downstream assigned label advertisement defined by 
  [RFC3031], [LDP-UPSTREAM] specification defines new mode of label 
  advertisement where label advertisement and distribution occurs for 
  upstream assigned labels.  

  As stated in earlier section 3.1 of this document, [RFC5036] only 
  allows specifying Downstream-Unsolicited or Downstream-on-Demand 
  mode. This means that any LDP application that requires upstream

Internet-Draft  Applicability of LDP Label Advertisement Mode July 2011 
 
  assigned label advertisement also falls under the category of Session 
  mode-independent application. 

3.3. Update to RFC-5036 

   For clarification reasons, section 3.5.3 of [RFC5036] is updated to 
   add following two statements under the description of "A, Label 
   Advertisement Discipline": 

   -  The negotiated label advertisement discipline only applies to FEC 
     label binding advertisement of "Address Prefix" FECs;  

   -  Any document specifying a new FEC SHOULD state the applicability 
     of the negotiated label advertisement discipline for that FEC. 

3.4. Update to RFC-4447 

   [RFC4447] specifies LDP extensions and procedures to exchange label 
   bindings for P2P PW FECs. The section 3 of [RFC4447] states: 

     "LDP MUST be used in its downstream unsolicited mode."

   Since PW application falls under session mode-independent 
   application category, the above statement in [RFC4447] should be 
   read to mean as follows: 

   "LDP MUST exchange PW FEC label bindings in downstream unsolicited 
   manner, independent of the negotiated label advertisement mode of 
   the LDP session." 

4. Future Work 

   This document only clarifies the existing behavior for LDP label 
   advertisement mode for different applications without defining any 
   protocol extensions. In future, a new LDP capability [RFC5561] based 
   mechanism can be defined to signal/negotiate label advertisement 
   mode per FEC/application. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document specification only clarifies the applicability of LDP 
   session's label advertisement mode, and hence does not add any LDP 
   security mechanics and considerations to those already defined in 
   LDP specification [RFC5036].
