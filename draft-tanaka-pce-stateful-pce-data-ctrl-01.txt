    Stateful PCE Extensions for Data Plane Switchover and Balancing
               draft-tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-data-ctrl-01

Abstract

   Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding
   protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do
   stateful control of MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
   LSP).  One application that stateful PCE can realize is data traffic
   reoptimization.  Data traffic traversed in a LSP can be switched to
   another PCE-initiated LSP.  Moreover, data traffic can also be
   balanced to multiple PCE-initiated LSPs using stateful PCE.

   This document specifies the extensions to Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to do switchover and
   balancing of data traffic with PCE-initiated LSPs.  This document
   also specifies the usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE
   Communication Protocol) messages and the expected behavior of PCC as
   the RSVP-TE headend.

Internet-Draft       Data Control using Stateful PCE            Oct 2013


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes the stateful Path Computation
   Elements(PCE).  Stateful PCE defines the extensions to PCEP to enable
   stateful control of LSPs between and across PCEP sessions, and it
   also describes mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between
   PCCs and PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of path
   computations within and across PCEP sessions.  A PCE can update LSP
   settings (such as bandwidth, priority) using update messages calle
   PCUpd.

   [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] defines the exensions to PCEP to
   allow a PCE to create new LSPs (PCE-Initiated LSP).  Before these
   extensions, the LSP egress point had to be preconfigured at the head
   end Label Edge Router (LER), the LSP would be set up with default
   parameters and then its settings (e.g., initial bandwidth, priority)
   could be modified via PCUpd messages.  The extensions for PCE-
   initated LSPs eliminate the need for preconfiguration, and allow more
   flexible operation.  Stateful-PCE with LSP instantiation is
   attracting attention as an enabler for Software Defined Networking
   (SDN) operation of MPLS networks.

   In SDN, it is highly expected to support intelligent and interactive
   control of the traffic amount of the network by means of a logically-
   centralized controller.  Optimizing the path and bandwidth of MPLS-TE
   LSP by using stateful PCE is a leading use case of SDN applications.
   A PCE is able to calculate an optimized route from the topology and
   bandwidth information in the TED and the LSP state database and it
   can integrate with a controller that takes into account additional
   information such as historical trending and service orders in order
   to trigger PCE action.  For example, when data traffic on a LSP
   counts plenty of bandwidth utilization and if there is no capacity
   left in the currently signaled path (i.e., no remaining bandwidth of
   links), a PCE is able to update the existing LSP's parameters (PCE-
   updated LSP) or create a totally new LSP (PCE-initiated LSP).

   The former method is oriented for keeping the existing instance of
   LSP tunnel.  Meanwhile, the latter method is oriented for adding a
   new instance of LSP tunnel.

   Specifically regarding the latter method, PCE-initiated LSP, there
   are some operational scenarios in the network: one is that PCE
   creates a new LSP that have alternate route with increased-bandwidth
   LSP and performs switchover from old LSP.  Another is that PCE
   creates one or more additional LSPs and performs load balancing of
   data traffic.  Today, however, there is no detailed procedure
   specified as to how to control data traffic switching from an old LSP
   to new PCE-Initiated LSP(s).

   This document specifies the procedures that stateful PCE controls
   data traffic switchover and load balancing with multiple PCE-
   Initiated LSPs.  This document also specifies the usage and handling
   of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol) messages and the
   expected behavior of PCC as an RSVP-TE headend.

   The message formats in this document are specified using Backus-Naur
   Format (BNF) encoding as specified in [RBNF].


4.  PCEP Operation for Data Switchover and Balancing

   There are two typical operations for explaining the functionality of
   data switchover and balancing.  One is whole data switchover, where a
   PCC switches all data traffic from one LSP tunnel to another.  The
   other is load balancing of multi-pathing LSP tunnels, where a PCC
   (headend) balances data traffic among two tunnels equally (fifty
   percent each, for instance).  Both operational cases are completed by
   the messaging over a single protocol, PCEP, so this is a simple and
   straightforward solution for MPLS networks.

   Support of the procedures listed in this document is negotiated at
   session init time.  The capability negotiation will be speleld out in
   a future version of this document.

   Data switchover and balancing for an MPLS-TE LSP is available once a
   PCEP session is established and then a PCC delegates its LSPs to a
   PCE.



Tanaka, et al.           Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Data Control using Stateful PCE            Oct 2013


   First step is LSP creation.  In this step, a PCE sends as many
   PCInitiate messages as PCE-Initiated LSP as it demands.  Once the PCC
   receives them and successfully establishes PCE-Initiated LSPs, it
   sends PCRpt messages in reply to the PCInitiate messages and
   delegates the newly established LSP to the PCE.  Message formats and
   behaviors of the PCC and the PCE are described in detail in
   [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].

   Second step is LSP association.  After the PCE-Initiated LSP
   sucessfully established and delegated the PCE sends a PCUpd message
   that contains the ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV in the LSP Object in order to
   assemble the members of an association group of LSPs to take over the
   traffic.  Once a PCC receives the PCUpd message with ASSOCIATION-
   GROUP TLV, the PCC sends back a PCRpt message that contains the
   ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV with current operational status.

   The option of specifying the association at LSP instantiation time
   (as part of the PCInitiate message) will be evaluated in a future
   version of this document.

   Third step is executing the data switchover and/or load balancing.
   In this step, the PCE sends a single PCUpd message which updates the
   operational status of the LSP from "up and carrying traffic" to just
   "up".  This Update request message for data plane switchover/
   balancing execution MUST contain DATA-CONTROL TLV in LSP Object.  The
   associated group of traffic origin and that of target to take over
   the traffic are listed in the DATA-CONTROL TLV.  The PCC (LSP
   headend) load-balances between LSPs in the same association group
   based on their respective bandwidths.  The switchover case is
   supported since there will be an association of a single LSP, so that
   LSP will get hundred percent of data traffic.

   The PCC MUST send a PCRpt message to the PCE in order to notify of
   the result of the data switchover/balancing.  The PCRpt message MUST
   have the DATA-CONTROL TLV that indicates the actual assigned
   percentages of each member of association group after the execution
   of the data switchover/balancing operation.  The LSP object in the
   PCRpt will have the reserved PLSP-ID of 0.

   The final step is the deletion of old LSP.  It is OPTIONAL to carry
   out this step.  The PCE sends PCInitiate message requesting deletion
   of the LSP that does not carry data traffic anymore after data
   switchover/balancing execution.  Once the PCC tears down the LSP, a
   PCRpt message MUST be sent from the PCC to the PCE in order to notify
   that the LSP is no longer used and return delegation.

   Note that, both RSVP-TE [RFC3209] Tunnel-ID and LSP-ID for PCE-
   Initiated LSP signaling is not allocated by a PCE.  A PCC locally

Internet-Draft       Data Control using Stateful PCE            Oct 2013


   assigns those IDs that are related to RSVP-TE parameters.  Therefore,
   the operations of data switchover and balancing specified in this
   document is the traffic control procedure across multiple RSVP-te
   Tunnels (i.e., different Tunnel instances).  Data switchover method
   across LSPs within a single RSVP-TE Tunnel, which is the switchover
   in the middle of make-before-break reoptimization, is covered by
   [I-D.tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-mbb].


5.  TLVs in LSP Objects

5.1.  ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV in LSP Objects

   This section defines ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV in LSP Objects.
   ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV is used in the LSP Object in PCUpd messages
   when a PCE creates an association group of LSPs on a PCC.

                  Figure 1: ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV format

   Flags and fields

      Association Group ID - 16 bits:   This field specifies a
         identifier of association group of LSPs.  The IDs are assigned
         by a PCE, however a PCC (RSVP headend) owns the association
         group. 0x0000 and 0xFFFF is reserved for special use.
      Flags - 16 bit:   None defined.  MUST be set to zero.

   An association group is a group of LSPs that is referenced by a
   single identifier, by both the PCE and PCC.  This number is
   significant in the context of a single PCEP session.  An association
   group may have one or more LSPs.  Association groups with zero
   members are removed and the id can be reused.  The PCE is the entity
   managing association, and this is considered PCE state that will be
   cleaned up when the State Timeout Interval expires.

   The status of the association group is active when the group is up



Tanaka, et al.           Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 6]

   and carrying data traffic.  Meanwhile, That is inactive while the
   group does not carry data traffic.  An LSP is able to associate with
   up to two association groups, unless both association groups are
   active at any given point in time.

   To create a new association group on a PCC, a PCE sends a PCUpd
   message which contains the LSP Object(e.g.  PLSP-ID=100) and
   ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV (Association Group ID=10) in the LSP object.
   Next, a PCE sends the another PCUpd message with another LSP
   Object(e.g.  PLSP-ID=200) and ASSOIATION-GROUP TLV(Association Group
   ID=10).  As a result, the PCC and PCE both recognize that Association
   Group ID 10 represents PLSP-ID=100 and 200.

   To remove a specific PLSP-ID from the association group, a PCE sends
   PCUpd message which contains the LSP Object(PLSP-ID=100) and
   ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV (Association Group ID=0x0000).  Then a PCC
   removes the PLSP-ID 100 from any inactive association group on the
   PCC.

   To flush all association groups on a PCC, a PCE sends a PCUpd message
   which contains the LSP Object(PLSP-ID=0x0000) and ASSOCIATION-GROUP
   TLV(Association Group ID=0x0000).  Then a PCC flushes all association
   groups.  A traffic handling behavior of a PCC when it flushes the
   active association group is left for a future version of this
   document.

   To associate a PLSP-ID with the existing inactive association group,
   A PCE sends a PCUpd message which contains the PLSP-ID and the
   existing Association Group ID.  A PCE is not allowed to add any
   PLSP-ID to the active association group in order to avoid rebalancing
   traffic without data-ctrl requests.  If the PCUpd message contains a
   PLSP-ID and the active Association Group ID, the PCC MUST send out a
   PCErr with error value TBD to indicate an invalid operation.

   When the LSP of the active association group is torn down by a reason
   of either network failure or administrative down-request from the
   PCE, a PCC MUST remove the PLSP-ID from the group and rebalance the
   traffic based on the respective bandwidths of the rest of LSPs.
   After rebalancing, The PCC MUST report the actual percentage to the
   PCE using PCRpt with DATA-REPORT TLV.

   Note that a PCE is able to associate not only PCE-Initiated LSP but
   also existing LSP(i.e., PCE-updated LSP) with any association group
   on a PCC.

   The definition of PCRpt messages when a PCC creates/removes/flushes
   an association group will be clarified in the future version of this
   draft.  Redundant stateful PCE section needs the PCRpt in order to

      Origin Association Group ID:   data traffic origin
      Target Association Group ID:   for taking over whole data traffic
         from origin.
      O (Operational - 3 bits):   This bit represents the requested
         operational status by a PCE.  The meanings of the values are
         defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].
      Member in DATA-REPORT TLV:  This TLV is used in a PCRpt message
         and represents actual percentages of load balancing per
         respective PLSP-ID after load balancing execution.  Member
         field fills PLSP-ID that is member of target association group.
      Percentage in DATA-REPORT TLV - 8 bits:   This field specifies
         actual percentage of load balancing as an unsigned char.

   An LSP Object in a PCCUpd message MUST have DATA-CONTROL TLV when a
   PCE operates data switchover and balancing on a PCC.  DATA-CONTROL
   TLV is sub-TLV of an LSP Object and is used in both a PCUpd and a
   PCRpt message.

   An operation of data switchover/balancing is the action of
   transferring traffic from an origin association group to a target
   association group.  A PCUpd message with reserved LSP Object (PLSP-
   ID=0x0000) and DATA-CONTROL TLV (a set of an origin and a target
   association group) MUST triggers data switchover/balancing execution.

   A PCC replies to a PCE a PCRpt message as a notification of data
   switchover/balancing result.  The PCRpt message MUST have reserved
   LSP Object(PLSP-ID=0x0000) and DATA-CONTROL TLV with DATA-REPORT
   inside.

   The PCC load-balances between LSPs in the same association group
   based on their respective bandwidths.  If one of the LSPs goes down
   by network failure, the traffic would load-balance correctly over the
   others.  If a PCE updates the bandwidth of the LSP, the traffic would
   rebalance after a PCC completes the signaling.  If one of the LSPs is
   signaled with zero bandwidth, no traffic would be transfered to the
   LSP.  If all LSPs of the association group are signaled with zero
   bandwidth, the traffic would load-balance equally.  In switchover
   case, the hundred percent traffic will be transfered to the LSP even
   if the LSP is zero bandwidth.

   The traffic on the existing LSP is able to load-balance over both the
   existing LSP itself and new PCE-Initiated LSPs, by means of that the
   existing LSP belongs to both the origin association group and that of
   target.

6.  Operation Examples

   For easy understanding this section introduces typical operation
   examples of data switchover/balancing.

6.1.  Data switchover operation (100:0 => 0:100)

   A PCE instructs a PCC to switchover 100% traffic from association
   group ID 1 to association group ID 2.  A PCE sends single PCUpd
   message containing the reserved LSP Objects with DATA-CONTROL TLV.

   Expected PCUpd,PCRpt messages to create association group and to
   trigger data switchover follow.

6.2.  Load balancing operation (100:0 => 50:50)

   The scenario is one where the starting state is a single LSP (of
   bandwidth 100 M) is carrying the traffic.  To enable better bin-
   packing, the PCE may want to create two smaller LSPs instead, each of
   50M, and load balance the traffic over them.  To accomplish this, two
   association groups are used, the first (say association group ID 10)
   contains the LSP carrying the traffic, and the second (say
   association group ID 30) contains the two new smaller LSPs.  Expected
   PCUpd,PCRpt messages to create association group and to trigger load-
   balance follow (The instantiation of the original LSP of bandwidth
   100M and its association into group ID 10 is not shown)

7.  Redundant stateful PCEs

   Association group IDs are unique within a PCEP session across the
   primary PCE and the PCC.  A backup PCE has to synchronize the
   association group IDs and balancing percentages in advance of the
   failure on the primary PCE.  One practical method to synchronize is a
   PCC replicates each PCRpt message for the backup PCEP session.  A
   backup PCE is able to receive the association group IDs from
   ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV and the result of balancing percentages from
   DATA-REPORT TLV.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document defines extensions to PCEP to control load balancing of
   traffic across multiple LSPs or to completely switch traffic from one
   LSP to another.  The nature of these extensions results in more
   information being available for a hypothetical adversary and a number
   of additional attack surfaces which must be protected.  As a general
   precaution, it is RECOMMENDED that these PCEP extensions only be
   activated on authenticated and encrypted sessions across PCEs and
   PCCs belonging to the same administrative authority

   In addition to the security considerations and recommendations
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], the following also apply.

8.1.  Malicious PCE

   A malicious PCE may flap the traffic between several LSPs, creating
   shifting patterns in the network and excessive load on the PCC.  A
   PCC may protect itself from such an attack by enforcing a limit on
   the number of data-control requests per unit of time and MAY take
   additional steps ranging from delegation revocation to closing the
   PCEP session.

8.2.  Malicious PCC

   Because the PCE keeps state regarding LSP associations for all the
   PCCs, it is RECOMMENDED that the PCE have a bound on the amount of
   state each PCC can occupy, and in the context of this draft, the
   number of associations on a PCC and the number of associations each
   LSP may be part of.  Otherwise, a malicious PCC may create an
   unbounded number of associations.  Additionally, a malicious PCC may
   purposely fail data-control messages in order to force the PCE to
   continuously resend them and create artificial load on the PCE.  The
   PCE may protect itself from these situations by placing a limit on
   the number of failures and closing the PCEP session.


9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  PCEP TLV Indicators

   This document defines the following new PCEP TLVs:

     Value     Meaning              Reference
       TBD     DATA-CONTROL         This document
       TBD     DATA-REPORT          This document


9.2.  PCEP Error Objects

   This document defines new Error-Type and Error-Value for the
   following new error conditions:

                 Error-value=TBD:  No association group specified.
                 Error-value=TBD:  No PLSP can be added to
                                   the active association group.
