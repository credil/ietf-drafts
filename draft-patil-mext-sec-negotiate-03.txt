       Negotiation of security protocol for Mobile IPv6 operation
                   draft-patil-mext-sec-negotiate-03

Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 has relied on IPsec and IKEv2 for securing the signaling
   and user traffic.  A single security mechanism for Mobile IPv6 does
   not adequately address various deployment scenarios.  The one-size-
   fits-all security approach is ill suited for Mobile IPv6, as
   different deployments have different security requirements.  Multiple
   alternatives to securing signaling and user traffic have been
   proposed and are being considered for standardization.  When multiple
   security protocols coexist for providing security for mobile IPv6
   nodes, there is a need to negotiate the choice of security protocol
   between a mobile node and home agent a priori.  This document
   proposes a method for negotiating the security protocol to be used
   between mobile IPv6 nodes.

Internet-Draft        Security protocol negotiation         October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 has relied on IPsec and IKEv2 for securing the signaling
   and user traffic.  A single security mechanism for Mobile IPv6 does
   not adequately address various deployment scenarios.  The one-size-
   fits-all security approach is ill suited for Mobile IPv6, as
   different deployments need different security requirements.  Multiple
   alternatives to securing signaling and user traffic have been
   proposed and are being considered for standardization.  When multiple
   security protocols coexist for providing security for mobile IPv6
   nodes, there is a need to negotiate the choice of security protocol
   between a mobile node and home agent a priori.  This document
   proposes a method for negotiating the security protocol to be used
   between mobile IPv6 nodes based on the home agent controller (HAC)
   entity defined in [I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls].

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] security using IPsec and IKE is specified in
   [RFC3776] and [RFC4877].  A number of alternate security protocols
   for use by mobile IPv6 nodes have been proposed.  Authentication
   protocol for Mobile IPv6 [RFC4285] is an example of one such.  The
   use of such a mechanism is however restricted to networks with
   certain characteristics that are documented in the RFC.

   More recently, other security mechanisms for use in Mobile IPv6
   deployments have been proposed.  Transport Layer Security-based
   Mobile IPv6 Security Framework for Mobile Node to Home Agent
   Communication [I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls] proposes a security solution
   that uses TLS between the mobile node (MN) and a home agent
   controller (HAC) to bootstrap Mobile IPv6 and the security protocol
   parameters between the MN and home agent (HA).  Authorizing Mobile
   IPv6 Binding Update with Cryptographically Generated Addresses
   [I-D.laganier-mext-cga] proposes the use of CGA for securing the
   signaling between an MN and HA.

   Home Agent Controller (HAC)

      The home agent controller is a node responsible for bootstrapping
      Mobile IPv6 security associations between a mobile node and one or
      more home agents.  The home agent controller also provides key
      distribution to both mobile nodes and home agents.  Optionally,
      Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping can be done in addition to the security
      association bootstrapping between the mobile node and home agent
      controller.


3.  Problem Statement

   Security for Mobile IPv6 signaling and user traffic can be achieved
   via the use of different mechanisms.  At the present time the use of
   IPsec and IKEv2 is mandated and choice of any other security protocol
   does not exist.  However the use of IPsec and IKE for providing
   security does not fit all deployments.  Alternate security solutions
   have been proposed and could be used.  The use of a security protocol
   by mobile IPv6 nodes should be driven by the needs and requirements
   of a specific deployment.  An enterprise deployment of Mobile IPv6
   will have a different set of security requirements as compared to a
   cellular operator offering mobile IPv6 service.

   When Mobile IPv6 hosts have the option of choosing from multiple
   security protocols, there is a need to negotiate the use of a
   specific protocol between a mobile node and home agent prior to
   operation.  This problem is dealt with in the scope of this draft and
   solutions proposed.


4.  Using the Home agent controller

   The home agent controller (HAC) is an entity that is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls].  The HAC provides the MN with bootstrapping
   information of Mobile IPv6 such as assigned HA address, Home Network
   Prefix and MN IPv6 and/or IPv4 HoA.  In addition, it assigns security
   parameters information to constitute the MN-HA security association.
   The HAC can generate IPSec SA information such as keys and SPI and
   provide it to the MN through the secure TLS secure connection without
   the use of IKEv2 for this purpose.  The security association
   information is distributed by the HAC to the HA assigned to be used
   by the MN.

   In the proposed solution, the HAC is the central entity which plays
   the role of negotiating the security protocol to be used between a
   mobile node and the home agent.  The HAC is aware of the capabilities
   and security protocols of various home agents that it is associated

   with.  An MN MUST contact the HAC to obtain the home agent and home
   address to use.  The MN can also inform the HAC about the security
   protocols that it supports and can use for securing signaling and
   user traffic.  Based on the security protocols the MN informed, the
   HAC will then assign the MN a valid home agent in addition to
   informing it of the security protocol to be used.  Optionally, if the
   communication between the MN and the HA is to be protected by IPSec,
   the HAC may provide the MN and the assigned HA the relevant security
   parameters such as keys, SPI, ciphers etc. that constitutes an IPsec
   SA.  The MN may be configured with the address of HACs or
   alternatively it may discover a HAC via DNS.  This is dealt with in
   the [I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls] document.


5.  Negotiation of security protocol

   The mobile node establishes a TLS connection with the home agent
   controller (HAC) and exchanges a set of messages via this secure TLS
   tunnel to bootstrap mobile IPv6 as well as negotiate the choice of
   security protocol.  The security protocol information is exchanged
   using the Request-Response messaging within the TLS secure tunnel.
   The signaling flow diagram below illustrates this negotiation
   mechanism:

       MN and HAC is within the secure TLS connection.

   2.  The MN signals the security protocols that it supports including
       ciphersuite and capabilities.

   3.  The HAC obtains the MNs profile and allowed security methods for
       the MN from the AAA server.  The Home agent to be assigned to the
       MN is also informed by the AAA.  The HAC chooses the security
       protocol to be used based on the capabilities of the MN as well
       as policy information from the AAA.

   4.  The HAC indicates the security protocol to be used by the MN.  It
       also provides the MN with the security parameters such as
       encryption and integrity keys, SPI, and ciphers to be used for
       establishing the SA with the allocated HA.

   5.  The HAC also indicates to the assigned HA information about the
       MN and selected security protocol.  Additionally security
       parameters required for establishing the SA are delivered to the
       HA.

   6.  The MN establishes the security association of the type indicated
       by the HAC.  This could be an IPsec SA, or it could be the use of
       the SA defined in [I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls], the use of CGA or the
       use of Mobility Security Association as defined in [RFC4285].

   7.  The MN performs registration with the HA.  The BU/BAck are
       secured using the security protocol that has been chosen.

5.1.  Security Negotiation of Authentication Protocol for MIPv6

   This section describes the use of the proposed security negotiation
   protocol to negotiate the use of Authentication Protocol for MIPv6 as
   specified in [RFC4285].  That method can be applicable in network
   deployments where the home agent and home address is dynamically
   assigned to the mobile node and the security association is created
   via an out-of-band mechanism.  That information is distribuited by
   the home agent controller via the TLS session established with the
   mobile node.  The HAC fetches the security parameters that forms a
   mobility based security association from the AAA server and
   distribuite them to the mobile node and assigned home agent like
   security keys.

   The mobile node establishes a TLS connection with the home agent
   controller and exchange a set of messages via this secure TLS tunnel
   to bootstrap mobile IPv6.  The MN indicates the Authentication
   Protocol for MIPv6 as a supported security protocol.  The diagram
   below illustrates the negotiation of Authentication Protocol for

   MIPv6 as the security protocol to be used:

    Figure 2: Negotiation of Authentication Protocol for MIPv6  as the
                security protocol for use between MN and HA

   1.  The MN establishes a TLS session with the HAC and authenticates
       itself as described in [I-D.ietf-mext-mip6-tls].  All subsequent
       messaging between the MN and HAC is within the secure TLS
       connection

   2.  The MN indicates that it wants to use the Authentication Protocol
       for MIPv6 as the security protocol.  It should also inform its
       capabilities based on the type of access network and the security
       services that it provides.

   3.  The HAC obtains the MNs profile along with its allowed security
       methods from the AAA server.  The Home Agent to be assigned to
       the MN is also informed by the AAA.  Based on the MN capabilities
       and policy information from the AAA, the HAC chooses the RFC4285
       as the security protocol to be used.

   4.  The HAC indicates the security protocol to be used by the MN.
       The HAC also provides the information that composes a mobility
       security association between the MN and the HA like mobility SPI,
       keys, authentication algorithm and replay protection mechanism.

   5.  The HAC provides the assigned HA with information about the
       Authentication Protocol for MIPv6.  It also provides security

       parameters required for establishing the mobility security
       association.

   6.  The MN and HA establish the mobility security association just
       provided by the HAC.

   7.  The MN performs registration with the HA including the MN-HA
       mobility message authentication option with in the BU message.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any IANA requests at the present time.


7.  Security Considerations

   The signaling between the mobile node and home agent controller is
   secured by TLS.  All the messages between the MN and HAC are tunneled
   within the TLS connection and hence secured.  The MN and Home agent
   (HA) are either colocated or have a secure messaging interface
   between them.  There exists the potential to downgrade the choice of
   the security protocol between an MN and HA.  However the HAC chooses
   the security protocol to be used based on the capabilities of the MN
   as well as policy information from an entity such as AAA.  In case
   the MN is incapable of more robust secure mechanisms, the HAC may
   assign such a home agent with limited capabilities and connectivity.


8.  Summary and Conclusion

   The choice of security protocols to be used in mobile IPv6
   deployments increases the flexibility of the protocol and makes it
   viable for use in different deployment scenarios.  This however does
   result in the need for negotiation of a security protocol to be used
   between the MN and HA.  The capabilities of the MN and home agents
   available for use to an MN determine the security protocol that can
   be used.  Use of a home agent controller provides Mobile IPv6 with a
   robust mechanism for bootstrapping as well negotiation the security
   protocol.
