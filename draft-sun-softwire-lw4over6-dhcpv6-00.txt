Abstract

   Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an extension to
   DS-Lite which moves the Network Address Translation function from the
   DS-Lite AFTR to the B4.  It can be deployed in a DS-Lite network to
   gradually reduce the load of Carrier Grade NAT in the AFTR.  However,
   when DS-Lite and lw4over6 co-exist in the same network, B4 elemtns
   and lwB4 elements may want to signal the DHCPv6 server the type of
   AFTR (i.e.  AFTR or lwAFTR) they request.  In this memo, a new DHCPv6
   option is proposed for lwB4 element to request the IPv6 address of
   its corresponding lwAFTR.

Internet-Draft         DHCPv6 Option for lw4over6              July 2013


1.  Introduction

   Lightweight 4over6 (lw4o6) [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] defines a
   model for providing IPv4 access over an IPv6 network in which the
   Network Address Translation (NAT) function is performed by the
   Customer-Premises Equipment (CPE) instead of being centralized on a
   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN).  It removes the requirement for a Carrier
   Grade NAT function in the AFTR, and reduces the amount of centralized
   state in the AFTR.

   The DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Transport [I.D-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6]
   and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Option for Port Set
   [I.D-sun-dhc-port-set-option] can be used for lwB4 to be provisoned
   with the public IPv4 address and port set.  To discover the lwAFTR's
   FQDN, [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] re-uses the DS-Lite DHCPv6 option
   defined in [RFC6334].  However, for operators who have deployed DS-
   Lite and will deploy lw4over6 in the same network using the same
   DHCPv6 option, the DHCPv6 server will not be able to distinguish
   between DS-Lite subscriber and lw4over6 subscriber.

   In this memo, we define a new DHCPv6 option for lwB4
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] to request the DHCPv6 server its
   corresponding lwAFTR.  This new DHCPv6 option enables the DHCPv6
   server to distinguish between DS-Lite subscriber and lw4over6
   subscriber and offer the requested resources to the subscribers.
   This removes the requirement to pre-provision the subscriber type
   (i.e., DS-Lite or lw4over6) in the provision system.  This option is
   particularly helpful in a scenario where operators offer both DS-Lite
   and lw4over6 in the same network.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is used
   extensively in this document.


3.  Application Scenario

   There are several possible deployment scenarios in which DS-Lite and
   lw4over6 co-exist in the same network.

   In scenario 1, DS-Lite and lw4over6 are deployed in the same AFTR
   (depicted in Figure1).

        Figure 1: DS-Lite Coexistence scenario with Integrated AFTR

   The AFTR needs to distinguish the traffic from two transition
   mechanisms.  The first option is to distinguish using the client's
   source IPv4 address.  Two transition mechanisms can share the same
   tunnel endpoint address.  However, this requires the network element
   to examine every packet and may introduce significant overhead to the
   AFTR element.  The second option is to use separate tunnel endpoint
   addresses for DS-Lite and lw4over6.  This can be easily supported in
   the network element.  The second option is more practical and
   recommended.  This option requires the B4 element to discover the
   AFTR's FQDN and lwB4 element to discover lwAFTR's FQDN.

   In scenario 2, DS-Lite AFTR and lw4over6 lwAFTR do not co-locate in
   the same network element (as depicted in Figure2) and are usually
   configured with different tunnel endpoint address.  Similar to
   scenario 1 option 2, lwB4 also needs to discover a the lwAFTR's FQDN
   rather than the AFTR's FQDN.

Internet-Draft         DHCPv6 Option for lw4over6              July 2013


   There are two possible solutions for an lw4over6 lwB4 to discover its
   the lwAFTR's IPv6 address.

   1.  Subscriber Type Pre-configuration

   In this approach, the operator must pre-provision the subscriber type
   (e.g.  Alice is lw4over6 subscriber and Bob is DS-Lite subscriber) in
   the provisioning system, this information will be used to instruct
   the DHCPv6 server to offer AFTR or lwAFTR to the subscriber in the
   DHCPv6 reply.

     |<-----------------------------------|                      |

          Figure 3: Workflow of Subscriber Type Pre-configuration

   This approach requires operators to pre-provision static subscriber
   information in the provisioning system.  This requires modification
   in the provisioning system to include this new subscriber
   information.  Besides, when a subscriber migrates from DS-Lite to
   lw4over6, this will require update in the provisioning system.

   2. lw4over6 DHCPv6 option

   This approach is to use a new DHCPv6 option for lw4over6 lwB4.

   The DHCPv6 server can identify a lw4over6 subscriber by the lw4over6
   DHCPv6 request and offer lwAFTR's FQDN (depicted in the Figure4) to
   the lwB4 element.

        |<--------------------------------------|

               Figure 4: Workflow of lw4over6 DHCPv6 option

   The new DHCPv6 option enables the DHCPv6 server to offer the lwAFTR's
   FQDN to lwB4, the provisioning system does not need to be upgraded to
   identify the subscriber's type.  At migration, operators simply
   configure the B4 element to support NAT and this new DHCPv6 option,
   and this will be done.

   Therefore, a new lw4over6 DHCPv6 option is recommended.


4.  The lwAFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option

   The format of lwAFTR-Name option is the same as DS-Lite AFTR-Name
   option with a new option-code.  It is shown in Figure5.
