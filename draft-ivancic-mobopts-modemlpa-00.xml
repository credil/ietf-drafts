    <abstract>

<t> Nework devices and applications are increasingly connected to a 
variety of smart modems whose incoming and outgoing link rates can 
be varied over time to suit the channel characteristics.  Such rate 
changes can result from use of adaptive coding and modulation. The 
link rate and conditions offered by the modem to connected devices 
therefore vary. In order for connected devices and applications to 
get the most out of the modem's link capacity, it is necessary for 
the applications and connected devices to condition traffic. Thus, 
they need some knowledge of the modem's link conditions. This 
document describes one simple method for a modem to advertise link 
rate and other characteristics, via UDP messages, and discusses 
alternative approaches to communicating this information.

While the mechanism in this document is described in the context of 
a modem, it can also be broadly applied to other scenarios 
such as cryptographic devices.

Figure 1 illustrates the configuration of a space-based sensor 
onboard a satellite.  The host is co-located with the radio and 
connected via a serial link.  Since all clocking is derived from the 
modem and its serial link, a rate-based application on the host can run at line rate 
without overwhelming the modem. Furthermore, congestion control is 
not of concern if the space/ground link is a dedicated, private link.

Figure 2 illustrates  a wireless modem directly connected to a 
router.  Because Ethernet interfaces are plentiful and cheap, the 
modem and router are connected via high-speed Ethernet.  The router 
needs to know the actual link rate offered by the modem in order to 
properly set QoS and traffic shaping for that link; simply sending 
10/100 Mbps traffic to the modem and having the modem drop most of 
that traffic, because its outgoing link is slower, is not acceptable.
Traffic flows using TCP will 
autonomously adapt to rate changes by way of the TCP congestion 
control algorithms.  Rate-based protocols may not autonomously adapt 
- particularly if there is no effective way to implement congestion 
control such as on a unidirectional link.

<t>
It is possible to configure QoS and shaping on the 
router's Ethernet interface to match the modem's link rate, 
effectively extending the modem's link an extra hop to the router.  
However, such a static configuration is only useful if the modem's 
link rate is also static. Many modern modems are able to vary their 
communications according to the channel characteristics they 
experience, or due to negotiation with the modem at the other end of 
the link.  Examples include the Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) 
and Variable Coding and Modulation (VCM) used in DVB-S2, and ADSL2's 
Seamless Rate Adaptation (SRA).  Link characteristics may also vary 
due to layer-2 handovers, e.g.  IEEE 802.21 media-independent 
handoffs.  
</t>

<t>
The router needs to learn about changes in modem link 
characteristics in order to vary its QoS and shaping configurations 
to match the current characteristics and get the most from the 
modem's link.  The aim is to make the link between router and modem 
behave as an extension of the modem's own link.  
</t>

<t>
Consider the topology in Figure 3.  Here, an application is running 
on a host that is behind the router.  The application needs to know 
the downlink status of the modem in order to properly shape the 
data. For example, the application may be a video camera capable of 
setting the frame rate relative to the available bandwidth. By 
having the modem advertise its link properties, the application can 
autonoumously adapt to the offered rate. Note, in this instance, the
host and application are one hop removed from the router. Thus, 
advertisements of modem properties have to be able to pass beyond the
link-local network attachment of the modem.

Figure 4 depicts a multi-hop system with one router attached to 
multiple radios. This configuration shows the need for modem 
identification, as there may be more than one downstream link that 
needs to be considered by the router and applications. In addition, 
the applications that need to shape their traffic are multiple hops 
from the modems.  Knowing the current data rates and whether or not 
either link is available can enable the applications to make 
intelligent decisions regarding traffic shaping and when to send. 
For example: one such application may be to implement reactive 
fragmentation as soon as the link is down in Disconnection/Delay 
Tolerant Networking (DTN)  <xref target="RFC5050" />.

<t> One can replace the modem in Figures 1 through 4 with a 
cryptographic device and have the same basic problem.  For example, 
Figure 5 is the same basic scenario as Figure 3. Figure 5 
illustrates a cryptographic device directly connected to a router. 
Here, both interfaces may be bandwidth with a cryptographic device 
in between. The cryptographic devices normally operate at line rate. 
However, during rekeying the offered rate to the normal traffic may 
be reduced for a period of time or the tunnels may drop resulting in 
performance hits or momentary loss of communications. </t>

<t> In other traditional IP cryptos it is hard to sense the real 
rates offered through “the system”. It is feasible for such devices 
to work this out on their black side – and the red side  and simply 
advertise the “offered rate”. The black side can obtain knowledge of 
its downstream link state via modem advertisements, router 
advertisements or probes and pass this on to the red side via 
approved methods. The red side can then advertise its rate via the 
link property advertisment protocol. </t>

<t>
The simplest approach to this problem, taken by this draft, is to 
have the modem advertise its link conditions on its other local 
interfaces using UDP packets <xref target="RFC0768" /> sent to 
link-local multicast addresses. This approach requires no explicit 
configuration setup to provide information to connected devices.  
UDP is well-understood and widely available, making deployment 
relatively easy for all types of modems, routers and other connected 
devices.  
</t>

<t>
To handle advertisements beyond the local interface, Internet 
Protocol version 4 (IPv4) organizational-scoped multicast and 
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) site-local multicast MAY be 
used with no explicit configuration in the modem. Use of IPv4 
administratively-scoped  multicast and IPv6 site-local multicast 
could handle both devices that are directly connected to 
the modem as well as hosts and applications that are multiple hops 
away <xref target="RFC2365" /> <xref target="RFC2373" />. However, 
administratively scoped multicast can have some unusual deployments 
that may result in unforeseen global traffic. For example, in some 
implementations, site-local is the global corporation. This results 
in modem adverts suddenly flooding a planet-wide 
multi-protocol-label-switched net.  
</t>

<t>
Conversly, to handle advertisements beyond the local interface, 
unicast packets MAY be sent to known hosts.  This does require 
explicit configuration within the modem, but is simple and straight 
forward.  The end systems where such configurations apply are not 
expected to be large or complex and likely to consists of only a 
handful of hosts/applications.
</t>

<t>
Link property advertisements SHOULD be sent periodically or as 
notifications of link-layer events when they happen.  This falls 
into the scope of DNA [Detecting Network Attachment] processes <xref 
target="RFC4957" />.  

</t>


    </section>

	<section anchor="messageblocks" title="UDP messages providing 
	link notification">

<t>
The modem sends UDP updates about changing link and interface 
conditions (i.e. a link rate changes due to a coding change, or the 
link and its interface go up or down) to connected devices using 
link-local multicast packets and to upstream hosts and applications 
using IPv4 administratively-scoped  multicast and IPv6 site-local 
multicast packets and OPTIONALLY unicast packets.
</t>

<t>
As well as sending on event-triggered updates, the modem SHOULD send 
periodic advertisements about link conditions, in case new 
devices have been connected on e.g. a broadcast Ethernet LAN.  These 
updates are sent over both IPv4 and IPv6.  
</t>

<t>
This packet can include multiple Blocks containing different 
information, where each Block is structured as a Type/Length/Data 
field.  This document defines a single Rate Block which has multiple 
Link Instance sub-block sections for each input or output interface, 
each identifying the input or output link interface, and describing 
the link capacity available (current/maximum/minimum rates in bps). 
The diagram below shows an example Rate Block with a single 
(Incoming) Link Instance. If a modem is both IPv4- and IPv6-capable 
over its link to the router, this information SHOULD be repeated in 
IPv4 and IPv6 packets received by the attached device.

<t>
A bidirectional link on the modem will have incoming and outgoing 
interfaces that MUST share the same local identifier, and SHOULD 
share the same local IP address.  These interfaces are identified in 
separate sub-blocks with the I/O flag set appropriately, so that any 
asymmetry can be described properly.  This means that the unique 
modem interface identifier would be repeated for each sub-block, 
where one sub-block describes describes Incoming information, and 
the other Outgoing information.  The exception to this is if the 
link is symmetric, as only one sub-block is required with the 
Bidirectional Flag (B) set to 1. If a link is down, the D flag is 
taken as 'zero bit rate' and the 'current' rate indicates the last 
rate before the modem took the link down.  If the minimum and 
maximum rates are set to zero, this indicates a fixed-speed link 
whose rate is never altered.  An interface does not have to have any 
IP address.
</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="otherblocks" title="Other Possible Blocks">
<t>
Other possible blocks, not yet defined here, could express measured 
error rate, current forward error-coding rate, latency (propagation 
delay, serialization delay), link MTU size, indicate link-level 
security mechanisms in use, or provide authentication.
</t>

<t>
The resource and relative link quality metrics defined in <xref 
target="RFC5578" /> may also be of use.  Unlike [RFC5578], we 
deliberately define link capacity in exact bps rather than degraded 
approximate kbps, knowing that for very-low-rate modems, the exact 
bit rate matters for e.g. call admission control.  The lowest link 
rate that we have encountered is 75bps for submarine applications.
</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="uses" title="Uses of these notifications">
<t>
An attached device MUST be able to receive link property 
advertisements via UDP/IP packets sent to the "all routers" 
multicast address.  Information from this message is used to 
construct or update the QoS and shape policies applied on the 
interface for traffic directed through the modem's link.
</t>

<t>
An attached router MAY use this information to update its routing 
table so that the routing information associated with a route 
through the modem is either deleted or added or updated with a new 
metric. Changes in the routing table information are then propagated 
further.
</t>

<t>
The modem MAY damp changes to Link Instance information, to prevent 
advertising transient changes, in line with <xref target="RFC4907" />.
A router MAY also damp responses to frequent changes in Link 
Instance information received, so that related QoS policies and 
routing information are not updated until a certain time period has 
elapsed. This hysteresis would be useful in the case of a
rapidly-varying link  rate, where the router would stick to the minimum rate seen.
</t>

<t>
A router may also use this information as input to e.g. Call 
Admission Control (CAC) functionality to reserve capacity for calls. 
This can deny registered applications such as telephony call setup 
etc. in the event of less-than-desired available link capacity 
through the modem's interface.
</t>

<t>
To ensure stable operation, upstream hosts and applications MAY use 
link property advertisements to damp responses to frequent changes in 
link instance information, e.g. via some form of hysteresis algorithm.
</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="alternatives" title="Alternative approaches to the problem">
<t>
The simplest approach to this problem is to have a fixed serial 
interface between modem and router, with the modem altering the 
serial rate clock to match the speed of its link, and the router 
measuring the rate of the received clock.  However, fast serial 
interfaces are unfashionable, and Ethernet now dominates the world.
</t>

<t>
We considered using ICMP <xref target="RFC0792" /> <xref target=
"RFC4443" /> to provide this rate information, using the framework 
for carrying extended information in ICMP messages [RFC4884].  
However, this extended information can only be carried in 
Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded ICMP messages (for both 
IPv4 and IPv6) and Parameter Problem (for IPv4 only) ICMP messages.  
These messages are responses to specific problems, and should not be 
overloaded for general advertisements. The appropriate ICMP message 
type would be the obsolete Information Request messge (type 15), 
though requests are also sent unsolicited for this use. Another 
factor in preferring UDP over ICMP is that sockets programming for 
UDP is easier than for ICMP, easing implementation.
</t>

<!--
<t>
Use of IPv4 administratively-scoped  multicast and IPv6 site-local 
multicast was considered to handle both the devices that are 
directly connected to the modem as well as host and applications 
that are multiple hops away <xref target="RFC2365" /> <xref target=
"RFC2373" />.  However, administratively-scoped multicast can have 
some unusual deployments that may result in unforeseen global 
traffic. For example, in some implementations, site-local is the 
global corporation; your modem adverts are suddenly flooding a 
planet-wide multi-protocol-label-switched net.
</t>
-->

<t>
Other approaches to this problem have been proposed. None of these 
approaches addresses the need to extend the modem advertisement beyond 
the locally attached device.
</t>  
   
<t>
The authors have outlined an approach leveraging the Access Node 
Control Protocol, used in the head-ends of DSL networks, within 
DSLAMs <xref target="I-D.floreani-ancp-wireless"/>.  However, ANCP 
is not lightweight and depends on GSMP, which depends on TCP.  The 
ANCP workgroup is currently focused on the DSL headend, and has yet 
to extend beyond that environment, while the this link property 
advertisement proposal is useful at the tail-end in customer networks.
</t>

<t>
Another approach aimed at improving communication between modems and 
routers is outlined in <xref target="RFC5578" />.  That approach 
assumes a PPPoE infrastructure.  PPPoE is not always architecturally 
suitable to network needs, and requiring PPPoE infrastructure and 
introducing authentication dependencies for what was just a simple 
local modem-router (or other attached device) problem is overkill.  
That approach may be suitable as an upgrade to existing PPPoE 
environments.  Adoption of the metrics described in <xref target= 
"RFC5578" /> but with communication separate from PPPoE could be 
very useful for a wider market, and would provide more information 
than the link rate information outlined in this draft.  
</t>
  
<t>               
The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) <xref target=
"I-D.ietf-manet-dlep"/> also addresses changes in link 
characteristics such as fluctuations in speed and quality of links  
due to configuration (in the case of cable/DSL modems), or on a 
moment-to-moment basis, due to physical phenomena like multipath 
interference, obstructions, rain fade, etc. DLEP runs between a 
router and its attached modem devices, allowing the modem to 
communicate link characteristics as they change, and convergence 
events (acquisition and loss of potential routing neighbors).  
However, DLEP is differs from LPA in the following ways: 
	
	<list style="format %d)">
		<t>DLEP 
		utilizes a session paradigm between the modem device and its 
		associated router. 
		</t> 

		<t> DLEP assumes that participating modem devices appear to 
		the router as a transparent bridge - specifically, the 
		assumption is that the destination MAC address for data 
		traffic in any frame emitted by the router should be the MAC 
		address of the next-hop router or end- device, and not the 
		MAC address of any of the intervening modem devices. 
		</t>  
		
		<t>
		DLEP is designed to operate only over the local-link and 
		does not accommodate systems that are multiple hops away 
		from the modem.
		</t>
	</list>	
		
</t>


<t>
Ethernet pause frames have also been suggested as one way of slowing 
the Ethernet link to match the modem's link a hop further along <xref
target="GePause2004"/>.  This approach has the disadvantage of 
being tied to a particular layer-2 technology, while fine-tuning the 
pause frames to match the modem's offered link rate has the 
potential to introduce complex control loops and problems as the 
paused Ethernet rate approximates the modem link rate and interacts 
with QoS and shaping delay mechanisms on the router.
</t>


<t>
DHCP is intended for address configuration of hosts, so is not 
considered suitable as a way of piggybacking this information.
</t>
    </section>


    <section anchor="sec-con" title="Security Considerations">
<t> 
Link instance advertisements should only be local to connecting 
devices, and should not be propagated further unless specifically 
configured to do so using IPv4 administratively-scoped multicast type and and 
IPv6 site-local multicast or unicast packets. It is assumed that  
unicast would be site local and under the control of the network 
administrator.  Furthermore, IPsec authentication could be deployed 
if deemed necessary.
</t>

<t>
As multicast packets are sent only to link-local multicast 
addresses, TTL safeguards such as GTSM <xref target="RFC5082" />, 
which sets TTL to a hard-to-spoof 255, should be unnecessary.  
Deliberately setting a large TTL on any multicast packet would be 
unwise if it were to be propagated further.
</t>

<t>
The decision to use this information more broadly feeds into routing 
metric updates and policy decisions there; taking the information 
beyond immediately-connected links becomes a routing problem, and 
has not been described here.
</t>

<t>
Some form of authentication of the modem sender is required to 
prevent spoofing from other local devices.  It should be possible to 
configure the UDP port number used by the router and modem, to avoid 
attacks on a well-known port assigned by IANA.
</t>

<t>
Separation of secure and insecure networks, with the modem on the insecure
side, wil prevent applications from trusting any information received
from the modem.
</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>
IANA must allocate a UDP port for use.
</t>

<t>
IANA must allocate a new IPv4 administratively-scoped multicast 
address and IPv6 site-local multicast address for LPA advertisements. 
</t>

<t>
Multicast packets are sent to the well-known link-local "all 
routers" multicast addresses (224.0.0.2 and ff02::2).  No further 
addresses are needed. Unicast link property advertisement are 
deployment-specific.
