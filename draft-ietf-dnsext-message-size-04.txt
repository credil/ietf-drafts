This document mandates support for EDNS0 (Extension Mechanisms for
DNS) in DNS entities claiming to support either DNS Security
Extensions or A6 records.  This requirement is necessary because these
new features increase the size of DNS messages.  If EDNS0 is not
supported fall back to TCP will happen, having a detrimental impact on
query latency and DNS server load.  This document updates RFC 2535
and RFC 2874, by adding new requirements.


This document is a product of the DNS Extensions Working Group of the
IETF.
