1 Overview 
    
   This document describes the Remote APDU Call Protocol Secure (RACS) 
   protocol, dedicated to Grid of Secure Elements (GoSE). These servers 
   host Secure Elements (SE), i.e. tamper resistant chips offering 
   secure storage and cryptographic resources. 
    
   Secure Elements are microcontrollers whose chip area is about 25mm2; 
   they deliver trusted computing services in constrained environments. 
    
   RACS supports commands for GoSE inventory and data exchange with 
   secure elements. 
    
   RACS is designed according to the representational State Transfer 
   (REST) architecture [REST], which encompasses the following 
   features: 
   - Client-Server architecture. 
   - Stateless interaction. 
   - Cache operation on the client side. 
   - Uniform interface. 
   - Layered system. 
   - Code On Demand. 
    
1.1 What is a Secure Element 
    
   A Secure Element (SE) is a tamper resistant microcontroller equipped 
   with host interfaces such as [ISO7816], SPI (Serial Peripheral 
   Interface) or I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit). 
    
   The typical area size of these electronic chips is about 25mm2. They 
   comprise CPU (8, 16, 32 bits), ROM (a few hundred KB), nonvolatile 
   memory (EEPROM, FLASH, a few hundred KB) and RAM (a few ten KB). 
   Security is enforced by multiple hardware and logical 
   countermeasures. 
    
   According to the [EUROSMART] association height billion of such 
   secure devices were shipped in 2013. Secure elements are widely 
   deployed for electronic payment (EMV cards), telecommunication (SIM 
   modules), identity (electronic passports), ticketing, and access 
   control. 
    
   Most of secure elements include a Java Virtual Machine and therefore 
   are able to execute embedded program written in the JAVACARD 
   language. Because these devices are dedicated to security purposes 
   they support numerous cryptographic resources such as digest 
   functions (MD5, SHA1, SHA2...), symmetric cipher (3xDES, AES) or 
   asymmetric procedures (RSA, ECC). 
    
   A set of Global Platform [GP] standards control the lifecycle of 
   embedded software, i.e. application downloading, activation and 
   deletion.

   As an illustration a typical Secure Element has the following 
   characteristics: 
    
   - JAVACARD operating system; 
   - Compliant with the GP (Global Platform) standards;  
   - 160 KB of ROM; 
   - 72 KB of EEPROM; 
   - 4KB of RAM; 
   - Embedded crypto-processor; 
   - 3xDES, AES, RSA, ECC; 
   - Certification according to Common Criteria (CC) EAL5+ level; 
   - Security Certificates from payment operators.

   Figure 1. Architecture of a Grid of Secure Elements 
    
   A grid of Secure Elements (GoSE) is a server hosting a set of secure 
   elements. 
    
   The goal of these platforms is to deliver trusted services over the 
   Internet. These services are available in two functional planes, 
   - The user plane, which provides trusted computing and secure 
   storage. 
   - The management plane, which manages the lifecycle (downloading, 
   activation, deletion) of applications hosted by the Secure Element. 
    
   A grid of Secure Elements offers services similar to HSM (Hardware 
   Secure Module), but may be managed by a plurality of administrators, 
   dealing with specific secure microcontrollers. 
    
   According to this draft all accesses to a GoSE require the TCP 
   transport and are secured by the TLS [TLS 1.0] [TLS 1.1] [TLS 2.0] 
   protocol. 

   Urien                   Expires February 2014            [Page 5] 
 
                                  RACS                    August 2013 
 
    
   The RACS protocol provides all the features needed for the remote 
   use of secure elements, i.e. 
   - Inventory of secure elements 
   - Information exchange with the secure elements 
    
    
1.3 Secure Element Identifier (SEID) 
    
   Every secure element needs a physical slot that provides power 
   feeding and communication resources. This electrical interface is 
   for example realized by a socket soldered on an electronic board, or 
   a CAD (Card Acceptance Device, i.e. a reader) supporting host buses 
   such as USB. 
    
   Within a GoSE each slot is identified by a SlotID (slot identifier) 
   attribute, which may be a socket number or a CAD name. 
    
   The SEID (Secure Element Identifier) is a unique identifier 
   indicating that a given SE is hosted by a GoSE. It also implicitly 
   refers the physical slot (SlotID) to which the SE is plugged. 
    
   The GoSE manages an internal table that establishes the relationship 
   between SlotIDs and SEIDs. 
    
   Therefore three parameters are needed for remote communication with 
   secure element, the IP address of the GoSE, the associated TCP port, 
   and the SEID. 
    
    
1.4 APDUs 
    
   According to the [ISO7816] standards secure element process ISO7816 
   request messages and return ISO7816 response messages, named APDUs 
   (application protocol data unit). 
    
  1.4.1 ISO7816 APDU request 
    
   An APDU request comprises two parts: a header and an optional body. 
    
   The header is a set of four or five bytes noted CLA INS P1 P2 P3 
    
   - CLA indicates the class of the request, and is usually bound to 
   standardization committee (00 for example means ISO request). 
   -INS indicates the type of request, for example B0 for reading or D0 
   for writing. 
   - P1 P2 gives additional information for the request (such index in 
   a file or identifier of cryptographic procedures) 
   - P3 indicates the length of the request body (from P3=01 to P3=FF), 
   or the size of the expected response body (a null value meaning 256 
   bytes). Short ISO7816 requests may comprise only 4 bytes

                                  RACS                    August 2013 
 
   - The body may be empty. Its maximum size is 255 bytes 
    
  1.4.2 ISO7816 APDU response 
    
   An APDU response comprises two parts an optional body and a 
   mandatory status word. 
    
   - The optional body is made of 256 bytes at the most. 
    
   - The response ends by a two byte status noted SW. SW1 refers the 
   most significant byte and SW2 the less significant byte. 
    
   An error free operation is usually associated to the 9000 status 
   word. Following are some interpretations of the tuple SW1, SW2 
   according to various standards: 
    
   - '9F' 'xx', indicates that xx bytes (modulus 256) are ready for 
                reading. Operation result MUST be fetched by the ISO 
                Get Response APDU (CLA = 'C0', P1=P2= '0', P3= 'XX') 
   - '67' 'XX', incorrect parameter P3 
   - '6B' 'XX', incorrect parameter P1 or P2 
   - '6D' 'XX', unknown instruction code (INS) given in the request 
   - '6E' 'XX', wrong instruction class (CLA) given in the request 
   - '6F' 'XX', technical problem, not implemented... 
   - '61 ''XX', operation result MUST be fetched by the ISO  
                Get Response APDU (CLA = 'C0', P1=P2= '0', P3= 'XX') 
   - '6C ''XX', operation must be performed again,  
                with the LE parameter value sets to 'XX'.

   Figure 2. The RACS stack 
    
   The RACS protocol works over the TCP transport layer and is secured 
   by the TLS protocol. The TLS client (i.e. the RACS client) MUST be 
   authenticated by a certificate. 
    
   One of the main targets of the RACS protocol is to efficiently push 
   a set of ISO7816 requests towards a secure element in order to 
   perform cryptographic operations in the user's plane. In that case a

                                  RACS                    August 2013 
 
   RACS request typically comprises a prefix made with multiple ISO7816 
   requests and a suffix that collects the result of a cryptographic 
   procedure. 
    
   The use of TLS with mutual authentication based on certificate 
   provides a simple and elegant way to establish the credentials of a 
   RACS client over the GoSE. It also enables an easy splitting between 
   users' and administrators' privileges. 
    
    
2.1 Structure of RACS request 
    
   A RACS request is a set of command lines, encoded according to the 
   ASCII format. Each line ends by the CR (carriage Return) and line 
   feed (LF) characters. 
    
   Each command is a set of tokens (i.e. words) separated by the space 
   (0x20) character(s). 
    
   The first token of each line is the command to be executed. 
    
   A command line MAY comprise other tokens, which are called the 
   command parameters. 
    
   A RACS request always starts by a BEGIN command and ends by an END 
   command. 
    
   The processing of a RACS request is halted after the first error. In 
   that case the returned response contained the error status induced 
   by the last executed command. 
    
2.2 Structure of a RACS response 
    
   A RACS response is a line, encoded according to the ASCII format, 
   which ends by the CR (carriage Return) and line feed (LF) 
   characters. 
    
    
   The first token is the response status. The first character of the 
   status is either '+' in case of success or '-' if an error occurred 
   during the RACS request execution. It is followed by an ASCII 
   encoded integer, which is the value of the status. 
    
   A response line MAY comprise other tokens, which are called the 
   response parameters. 
    
   Examples of RACS responses: 
    
   +000 Success 
   -300 Error at line 2 
   -400 Unknown command at line 2

   -500 Conditions not satisfied at line 2 
   -600 Timeout occurred at line 2 
    
    
2.3 RACS commands 
    
  2.3.1 BEGIN 
    
   This command starts a request message. A response message is 
   returned if an error is detected. 
    
  2.3.2 END 
    
   This command ends a request message. It returns the response message 
   triggered by the last command. 
    
   Example1 
   ======== 
   Request: 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   END CR LF 
   Response: 
   +000 Success CR LF 
    
   Example2 
   ======== 
   Request: 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   APDU ASTERIX-CRYPTO-MODULE [ISO7816-Request] CR LF 
   END 
    
   Response: 
   +000 [ISO7816-Response] CR LF 
    
  2.3.3 GET-VERSION 
    
   This command requests the current version of the RACS protocol. 
   The returned response is the current version encoded by two integer 
   separated by the '.' character. The first integer indicates the 
   major version and the second integer gives the minor version. 
    
   Example 
   ======= 
   Request: 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   GET-VERSION CR LF 
   END 
    
   Response: 
   +000 1.0 CR LF

  2.3.4 SET-VERSION 
    
   This command sets the version to be used for the RACS request. An 
   error status is returned by the response if an error occurred. 
    
   Example 1 
   ========= 
   Request: 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   SET-VERSION 2.0 CR LF 
   END CR LF 
    
   Response: 
   -400 Error line 2 RACS 2.0 is not supported 
    
    
   Example 2 
   ========= 
   Request: 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   SET-VERSION 1.0 CR LF 
   END CR LF 
    
   Response: 
   +000 RACS 1.0 has been activated CR LF 
    
    
  2.3.5 LIST 
    
   This command requests the list of SEID plugged in the GoSE. 
    
   It returns a list of SEIDs separated by space (0x20) character(s) 
    
   Some SEID attributes could be built from a prefix and an integer 
   suffix (such as SE#100 in which SE# is the suffix and 100 is the 
   integer suffix. A list of non-consecutive SEID could be encoded as 
   prefix[i1;i2;..;ip] where i1,i2,ip indicates the integer suffix. A 
   list of consecutive SEID could be encoded as prefix[i1-ip] where 
   i1,i2,ip indicates the integer suffix. 
    
   Example 1 
   ========= 
   Request: 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   LIST CR LF 
   END CR LF 
    
   Response: 
   +000 SEID1 SEID2 CR LF

  2.3.6 RESET 
    
   This command resets a secure element. The first parameter gives the 
   secure element identifier (SEID). An optional second parameter 
   specifies a warm reset. The default behavior is a cold reset. 
   The response status indicates the success or the failure of the 
   operation.

  2.3.7 APDU 
    
   This command sends an ISO7816 request to a secure element or a set 
   of ISO7816 commands. 
    
   The first parameter specified the SEID 
    
   The second parameter is an ISO7816 request

                                  RACS                    August 2013 
 
   Three optional parameters are available; they MUST be located after 
   the second parameter. 
    
   - CONTINUE=value, indicates that the next RACS command will be 
   executed only if the ISO7816 status word (SW) is equal to a given 
   value. Otherwise an error status is returned. 
   - MORE=value, indicates that a FETCH ISO7816 request will be 
   performed (i.e. a new ISO7816 request will be sent) if the first 
   byte of the ISO7816 status word (SW1) is equal to a given value. 
   - FETCH=value fixes the four bytes of the ISO7816 FETCH request 
   (i.e. CLA INS P1 P2). The default value is 00C00000 (CLA=00, INS=C0, 
   P1=00, P2=00) 
    
   When the options CONTINUE and MORE are simultaneously set the SW1 
   byte is first checked. If there is no match then the SW word is 
   afterwards checked. 
    
   SYNTAX 
   APDU SEID ISO7816-REQUEST [CONTINUE=SW] [MORE=SW1] [FETCH=CMD] 
    
   The returned response is the ISO7816 response. If multiple ISO7816 
   requests are executed (due to the MORE option), the bodies are 
   concatenated in the response, which ends by the last ISO7816 status 
   word. 
    
   Example 1 
   ========= 
   Request: 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   APDU SEID ISO7816-REQUEST CR LF 
   END CR LF 
    
   Response: 
   +000 ISO7816-RESPONSE CR LF 
    
   Example 2 
   ========= 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   APDU SEID ISO7816-REQUEST-1 CONTINUE=9000 CR LF 
   APDU SEID ISO7816-REQUEST-2 CR LF 
   END CR LF 
    
   Response: 
   +000 ISO7816-RESPONSE-2 CR LF 
    
   Example 2 
   ========= 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   APDU SEID ISO7816-REQUEST-1 CONTINUE=9000 CR LF 
   APDU SEID ISO7816-REQUEST-2 CR LF 
   END CR LF

   Response: 
   -300 Request Error line 1 wrong SW CR LF 
    
    
   Example 3 
   ========= 
   BEGIN CR LF 
   APDU SEID ISO7816-REQ-1 CONTINUE=9000 CR LF 
   APDU SEID ISO7816-REQ-2 CONTINUE=9000 CR LF 
   APDU SEID ISO7816-REQ-3 CONTINUE=9000 MORE=61 FETCH=00C00000 CR LF 
   END CR LF 
    
   Response: 
   +000 ISO7816-RESP-3 CR LF 
    
   Multiple ISO7816 requests have been performed by the third APDU 
   command according to the following scenario 
   - the ISO7816-REQ-3 request has been forwarded to the secure element 
   (SEID) 
   - the ISO 7816 response comprises a body (body0) and a status word 
   (SW0) whose first byte is 0x61 
   - the FETCH command CLA=00, INS=00, P1=00, P2=00, P3=SW2 is sent to 
   the secure element 
   - the ISO 7816 response comprises a body (body1) and a status word 
   (SW1) set to 9000 
   -  
   The RACS response is set to 
   +000 body0 || body1 || SW1 CR LF 
   where ||indicates a concatenation operation. 
    
3 URI for the GoSE 
    
    
   The URI addressing the resources hosted by the GoSE is represented 
   by the string: 
    
   RACS://GoSE-Name:port/?request 
    
   where request is the RACS request to be forwarded to a the GoSE 
    
   RACS command lines are encoded in a way similar to the INPUT field 
   of an HTML form. Each command is associated to an INPUT name, the 
   remaining of the command line i.e. a set of ASCII characters, is 
   written according to the URL encoding rules. The BEGIN and END 
   commands are omitted; end of line characters, i.e. carriage return 
   (CR) and line feed (LF) are also omitted. 
    
   As a consequence request is written to the following syntax 
   cmd1=cmd1-parameters&cmd2=cmd2-parameters

4 HTTP interface 
    
   A GoSE SHOULD support an HTTP interface. RACS requests/responses are 
   transported by HTTP messages. The use of TLS is mandatory. 
    
4.1 HTTPS Request 
    
   https://GoSE-Name/RACS?request 
    
   where request is the RACS request to be forwarded to a secure 
   element (SEID) 
    
   The RACS request is associated to an HTML form whose name is "RACS". 
   The request command lines are encoded as the INPUT field of an HTML 
   form. Each command is associated to an INPUT name, the remaining of 
   the command line i.e. a set of ASCII characters is written according 
   to the URL encoding rules. The BEGIN and END commands are omitted; 
   end of line characters, i.e. carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) 
   are also omitted. 
    
   As a consequence a RACS request is written as 
   https://GoSE-Name/RACS?cmd1=cmd1-parameters&cmd2=cmd2-parameters 
    
4.2 HTTPS response 
    
   The RACS response is returned in an XML document 
    
   The root element of the document is <RACS-Response> 
    
   The status of the response is content of the <status> element 
    
   The parameters of the response are the content of the <parameters> 
   element 
    
   End of line, i.e. carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters 
   are omitted. 
    
   As a consequence a RACS response is written as 
   <RACS-Response> 
   <status>+000</status> 
   <parameters>parameters of the RACS response</parameters> 
   </RACS-Response
