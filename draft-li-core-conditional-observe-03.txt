                      Conditional observe in CoAP
                  draft-li-core-conditional-observe-03

Abstract

   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and
   networks.  Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in
   the state of resources and obtain a current representation of the
   last resource state.  This document defines a new mechanism in CoAP
   Observe so that a CoAP client can conditionally observe a resource on
   a CoAP server, only being informed about state changes meeting a
   specific condition or set of conditions.  This offers possibilities
   to extend network intelligence, enhance scalability, and optimize the
   lifetime and performance in order to address the requirements from
   the Constrained Nodes and Networks.

Note

   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
   be sent to core@ietf.org.

Internet-Draft         Conditional observe in CoAP          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-coap] is an Application Protocol for Constrained
   Nodes/Networks.  The observe [I-D.ietf-core-observe] specification
   describes a protocol design so that a CoAP client and server can use
   the subject/observer design pattern to establish an observation
   relationship.  When observe is used, the CoAP client will get a
   notification response whenever the state of the observed resource
   changed.  However, in some scenarios, the CoAP client may only care
   parts of the state change of the resource, other state changes might
   be meaningless.  This inability to suppress additional notification
   results in superfluous traffic.  This memo defines a new CoAP option
   "Condition" that can be used to allow the CoAP client to condition
   the observe request, and only when such condition is met, the CoAP
   server shall send the notification response with the latest state
   change.  When such a condition fails, the CoAP server does not need
   to send the notification response.

1.1.  Justification

   A GET request that includes an Observe Option creates an observation
   relationship.  When a server receives such a request, it first
   services the request like a GET request without this option and, if
   the resulting response indicates success, establishes an observation
   relationship between the client and the target resource.  The client
   is notified of resource state changes by additional responses sent in
   reply to the GET request to the client.

   CoAP is used for Constrained Networks, especially used for
   transporting sensor data.  Different sensor equipments have different
   properties, e.g. different change rates, data unit, different
   response time, etc. resulting in varying clients' interests that
   differ from mere state changes.  As such, when a client wants to
   collect information from a sensor, it does not want to receive
   useless information.  In addition, this would cause the transmission
   of irrelevant information in an already constrained network.

   Consider the following example.

                         Figure 1: GET request with observe

   In this example, the sensor acts as a server, and it collects the
   resource data every 5 seconds.  When the client observes a resource
   on the server, it will receive a response whenever the server updates
   the resource, that is to say, mostly every 5 seconds the client will
   receive a notification response.  However, the client might be a
   quite simple equipment not too sensitive to the resource state
   change, so it may not want to receive the notification that often.
   One possible solution could be to change the sensor's parameter,
   shorten the collecting frequency.  However, the sensor should be able
   to provide services to many other clients, making it hard to find the
   best configuration that fits all clients' requirements.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Motivation

   The CoAP Observe Option gives clients the ability to observe changes
   in the state of resources.  A notification relationship is
   established and whenever the state of the resource changes, the new
   representation is pushed to the observer.  In many cases, an observer
   will typically be interested in state changes that satisfy a specific
   condition.  In addition, similar conditional observations will prove
   useful for many different resources.  For example, being informed
   when the state of a resource exceeds a specific value.

   Defining an agreed set of commonly used conditional observations has

   a number of advantages.  In a well-defined way, clients can observe
   different resources conditionally.  At the same time, these resources
   can clearly announce how they can be observed, facilitating machine
   processing of this information.  Also, intermediaries can process
   multiple conditional observations, having as goal to alleviate the
   load on the constrained network and devices.  In the absence of such
   a set of commonly used conditional observations, where every
   application developer can specify its own mechanisms, these
   advantages are lost.

   In [I-D.shelby-core-interfaces] a mechanism is described to provide
   additional information to the Observe Option through the use of query
   parameters.  It is possible to define a fixed set of query parameters
   to enable conditional observations.  However, many more query
   parameters can be offered by a resource for different purposes.  This
   complicates the automatic processing of conditional observations.  To
   alleviate this problem, this draft proposes to implement frequently
   occurring conditional observations through the use of a new CoAP
   Condition Option, having a compact representation and well-defined
   meaning.  For other specific conditional observations, another
   mechanism such as query parameters can be used to complement the
   Condition Option.


3.  The Condition Option


         +------+-----+-----------+-----------+--------+---------------+
         | Type | C/E | Name      | Data type | Length | Default       |
         +------+-----+-----------+-----------+--------+---------------+
         |  18  |  E  | Condition | uint      | 1-5 B  | (none)        |
         +------+-----+-----------+-----------+--------+---------------+

                       Table 1: Condition Option number


   The Condition Option has the option number 18.  The last bit
   indicates it is an elective option and the second to last bit
   indicates that this is a Proxy Unsafe option (similar to the Observe
   Option).  The delta between the Condition Option and the Observe
   Option is 12.

   The Condition Option can be present in both request and response
   messages.  In both cases, it must be used together with the Observe
   Option, since it extends the meaning of the Observe Option.

   In a GET request message, the Condition Option represents the
   condition the client wants to apply to the observation relationship.

   It is used to describe the resource states the client is interested
   in.

   In the response to the initial GET request message, the Condition
   Option, together with the Observe Option, indicates that the client
   has been added to the list of observers and that notifications will
   be sent only when the resource state meets the condition specified in
   the Condition Option.  In all further notifications, the Condition
   Option identifies the condition to which the notification applies.

   Basically, a similar procedure as described in the observe draft
   [I-D.ietf-core-observe] is followed, but extended with additional
   behavior by taking the Condition Option into account.  The exact
   semantics are defined in the sections below.

   The size of the Condition Option value is not fixed and can range
   from 1 to 5 bytes.  The value carried is in a specific format that
   consist of two parts: a mandatory condition header and an optional
   condition value.  The condition header has a fixed length of 1 byte
   and the condition value, when present, can range from 1 to 4 bytes.
   The condition header consists of 3 fields: the condition type (TYPE),
   reliability flag (R) and value type (V).

   The Condition Option may occur more than once.  If multiple Condition
   Options are present in a request, their relationship is "AND",
   meaning that the server will only send a notification when both
   conditions are fulfilled.  In the notifications to such a request,
   the same Condition Options are present.  The Figure 10 presents an
   example of a multiple condition with "AND" conjunction.

   Note that in order to establish an "OR" relationship between
   conditions, a client simply needs to send separate requests using a
   different source transport address.  The Figure 11 presents an
   example of OR condition with multiple requests, which are sent in two
   messages via different ports.

   Since this solution could be considered as non-optimal, an
   alternative solution is proposed for discussion in the Annex "Logic
   flag", where multiple OR relationships with multiple conditional
   options can be defined, similar as has been presented for the "AND"
   conjunction.

   The main reason of the current "OR" conjunction mechanism is
   motivated by making the parsing process as simple as possible.

                  Figure 2: Condition Option value

   TYPE: The condition type is a 5 bit integer indicating the type of
   the condition in the observe request or in a notification.  Every
   value of TYPE represents the type ID of a specific condition type.
   Every condition type can be complemented by a condition value in the
   VAL field, further specifying the condition in more detail.  Below is
   the definition of identified condition types.

   R: In an observe request, the reliability flag indicates whether
   notifications for that condition need to be send non-confirmable (0)
   or confirmable (1).  In the initial response, this flag indicates the
   server's willingness or ability to send the notifications confirmable
   or non-confirmable, as requested by the client.  In all further
   notifications, this flag can be changed depending on the server's
   decision.  In case of a request containing multiple Condition
   Options, the client must use the same value of the R flag in all
   Condition Options.  If the server receives a request with multiple

   Condition Options, which do not all share the same value of the R
   flag, the server MUST respond with a 4.00 "Bad Request" response
   code.

   V: The value type is a 2 bit field in a request or response that
   gives the data type of the condition value, when present in the
   Condition Option.  If no condition value is present, this field has
   no meaning and must be 0.  Table 2 gives an overview of all available
   value types.  The Duration data type is defined in Appendix C.2 of
   [I-D.bormann-coap-misc].  The representation of floating point
   numbers in a common format that is understandable by constrained
   devices is outside the scope of this document.

             +-----------------------+------+
             | Value type (2 bit)    | Id.  |
             +-----------------------+------+
             | Integer               |  0   |
             +-----------------------+------+
             | Duration (s)          |  1   |
             +-----------------------+------+
             | Float                 |  2   |
             +-----------------------+------+

                   Table 2: Value types

   VAL: The condition value is 1 to 4 byte value of the type indicated
   by the V flag.  The condition value is used to indicate the value
   that further specifies the condition type (e.g. a threshold).
   Condition types can require the presence of a condition value.  When
   a condition value is present in an observe request, the same value
   must be used in the initial response.  In all further notifications,
   the condition value can be left out to reduce the size of the option.


4.  Condition Types

   Table 3 gives an overview of all currently identified condition
   types.  If supported by the server, different condition types can be
   combined in a request to express a logical AND relationship.  By
   default, logical OR of condition types is always supported through
   sending separate requests using a different source transport address.

                                            Table 3: Condition types

   Time series: This condition indicates that a client wants to receive
   all state changes of a resource, but that it does not want to receive
   a notification in case the time since the last notification was sent
   became greater than the max-age of the resource and the resource did
   not change during this period.  This is a variant of the observe
   draft [I-D.ietf-core-observe] that deals with eventual consistency,
   which results in notifications even if the resource did not change in
   order to ensure the observer has a fresh representation of the
   resource.

   Minimum response time: For this condition, the value specified in the
   condition value field gives the minimum time in seconds the server
   should leave between subsequent notifications.

   Maximum response time: For this condition, the value specified in the
   condition value field gives the maximum time in seconds the server is
   allowed to leave between subsequent notifications.

   Step: For this condition, the value specified in the condition value
   field gives the minimum state change of a resource (since the last
   notification) before the server should send a new notification.

   AllValues<: This condition indicates that a client is only interested
   in receiving notifications whenever the state of the resource changes
   and the value is less than the value specified in the condition value
   field.

   AllValues>: This condition indicates that a client is only interested
   in receiving notifications whenever the state of the resource changes
   and the value is greater than the value specified in the condition
   value field.

   Value=: This condition indicates that a client is only interested in
   receiving notifications whenever the state of the resource changes
   and the value is equal to the value specified in the condition value
   field.

   Value<>: This condition indicates that a client is only interested in
   receiving a single notification whenever the state becomes higher or
   lower than the value specified in the condition value field.  Once
   the notification has been sent, no new notifications are sent for
   subsequent state changes where the value remains higher or lower.  As
   such, a single notifications is sent whenever a threshold is passed
   in either direction.

   Periodic: This condition indicates the periodic interval in seconds
   with which new notifications should be sent.


5.  Using the Condition Option

   Whenever a client wants to initiate a Conditional Observation
   relationship, it sends a GET request with both an Observe and at
   least one Condition Option.  The Condition Option extends the meaning
   of the Observe Option by including a condition that describes the
   resource states the client is interested in.  It represents the
   condition the client wants to apply to the observation relationship.

   When a server receives such a request, it first services the request
   the same way as described in [I-D.ietf-core-observe].  Next, if the
   server supports the Condition Option, it analyzes the Condition
   Option to find the condition requested by the client.  If the
   condition is supported, the relationship is stored and the client is
   informed about the successful establishment of the conditional
   relationship.  This is done by sending a response containing both the
   Observe and Condition Option, which implies that the client has now
   been added to the list of observers and will only be informed about
   state changes or resource states satisfying the condition described
   in the Condition Option.

Internet-Draft         Conditional observe in CoAP          October 2012


   Since the Condition Option is elective, an observe request that
   includes the Condition Option will automatically fall back to a basic
   observe request if the server does not support the Condition Option.
   There is no default value for the Condition Option.  Also, if the
   Condition Option is supported, but the requested condition is not
   supported by the resource, the request will also fall back to a basic
   observe request, resulting in a response only containing the Observe
   Option.  This implies that the client will now receive notifications
   as described in [I-D.ietf-core-observe] and that the client itself is
   responsible for processing the resource state in the notifications in
   order to identify whether the condition of interest is fulfilled.

   Whenever the state of a resource that supports conditional
   observations changes on the server, the server needs to check the
   established conditional relationships.  Whenever the condition is
   met, the server sends the notification response to the client that
   has established the relationship.  The response contains both the
   Observe Option and the Condition Option, where the latter option
   describes the condition that has been fulfilled.  If not met, the
   server does not send any response to the client.

   A client is allowed to use multiple Condition Options in an observe
   request in order to express a logical AND relationship between
   different condition types.  When a server receives such a request and
   it does not support composed conditions, the request will also fall
   back to a basic observe request, resulting in a response only
   containing the Observe Option.  If the server supports this, it will
   store the relationship and send back a response containing the same
   multiple Condition Options.

   In case a client wants to establish multiple different conditional
   relationships with the same server, it needs to use a different
   source transport address for every conditional relationship.


6.  Cancellation, updating and existence of conditional relationships

6.1.  Cancellation and updating

   In case a client wants to cancel an existing conditional
   relationship, it has to perform a GET request without Observe and
   Condition Option using the same source transport address used to
   establish the conditional relationship (i.e. source transport address
   of the original request).  Upon reception of such a GET request, the
   server will remove the client from the list of conditional observers
   for that resource.

   Alternatively the client can also send a confirmable request



Li, et al.               Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         Conditional observe in CoAP          October 2012


   containing a Condition Option with condition type _Cancellation_.
   The source transport address used by the client uniquely identifies
   the conditional relationship the client has with the server.  Upon
   reception of such a message, the server knows that the client wants
   to terminate the relationship it has established.

   This cancellation mechanism implies that whenever a client wants to
   establish multiple different conditional relationships with the same
   server, it needs to use a different source transport address for
   every conditional relationship.

   When a client has established a conditional relationship and it sends
   a new conditional observe request using the same source transport
   address, the existing relationship is removed and the new
   relationship established.  This way, a client is able to update
   existing relationships.

   Apart from the cancellation through sending a GET request without
   Observe and Condition Option, a conditional relationship can also be
   cancelled by sending a RST message in response of a confirmable
   notification.  When a client rejects a non-confirmable notification
   with a RST, the server can remove the client from the list of
   observers interested in the specific condition of the resource in
   case the server maintains state information about non-confirmable
   notifications.

   Next to this, if the server is for whatever reason not able to
   further fulfill the conditional relationship of a client, the server
   can also send a confirmable notification containing a Condition
   Option with condition type 'Cancellation'.  The source transport
   address used by the client uniquely identifies a conditional
   relationship with a server.  As such, upon reception of such a
   message, the client knows that the relationship it has established
   with that server is terminated.

   Finally, when a server sends confirmable notifications that are not
   acknowledged by the observer, the server may terminate the
   relationship after X unsuccessful notifications (X implementation
   dependent).

   Note: The possibilities to establish a Cancellation flag have also
   been evaluated, see Annex "Cancellation flag".  This has been
   discarded since, as it is too complex for processing, when multiple
   conditions are defined.

6.2.  Existence

   A client has the possibility to establish and remove conditional
   relationships.  A server can also inform a client about the removal
   of a conditional relationship.  Next to this, there is the issue of
   how long the relationship is guaranteed to exist in the absence of
   any explicit removal from either the client or server side (e.g. a
   client that wants to maintain the relationship for a very long time)
   or in the absence of frequent notifications.  To this end, a
   mechanism is needed for a client to know whether it is still on the
   list of observers and for a server to know whether a client is still
   an observer.

   In order for a client to know whether it is still on the list of
   observers after a long period without notifications or without
   confirmable notifications, the server can use the Pledge Option, as
   defined in [I-D.bormann-coap-misc].  By adding this option to its
   notifications, the server indicates how long it minimally promises to
   maintain that specific conditional relationship.  In case no new
   notifications or non-confirmable notifications are sent and the
   duration indicated in the Pledge Option is to expire, the client must
   renew the relationship by resending the same request, preferable as a
   confirmable message.

   In case the duration indicated in the Pledge Option expires at the
   server side and the client did not renew the relationship, the server
   must remove the relationship by sending an explicit cancellation
   message (a confirmable notification to the client's source transport
   address containing a Condition Option with condition type
   'Cancellation'.).  As such, the use of the Pledge Option extends the
   establishment and removal mechanism with a server-initiated mechanism
   to realize intermediate refreshments of the relationship.

   The second mechanism, a server to know whether a client is still an
   observer, is realized by adding a Keep-Alive Option to the observe
   request.  The size of the Keep-Alive Option value is 1 byte and
   represents a duration in seconds, using the Duration data type as
   defined in Appendix C.2 of [I-D.bormann-coap-misc].


         +------+-----+------------+----------------+--------+---------+
         | Type | C/E | Name       | Format         | Length | Default |
         +------+-----+------------+----------------+--------+---------+
         |  30  |  E  | Keep-alive | Duration in s  |  1 B   | (none)  |
         +------+-----+------------+----------------+--------+---------+

                     Table 4: Keep-alive Option number

Internet-Draft         Conditional observe in CoAP          October 2012


   The Keep-Alive Option has the option number 30, meaning that it is an
   elective, Proxy Safe option, but not a cache key.

   When the client adds the Keep-Alive option to its conditional observe
   request, it requests the server to confirm that the relationship is
   still alive every time the duration expires and no notifications or
   only non-confirmable notifications have been sent during that period.
   If the option is supported by the server, the option is added to the
   response.  Every time the duration expires and no notifications or
   only non-confirmable notifications have been sent, the server sends a
   confirmable notification to the client with an empty payload (since
   the condition is not fulfilled).  As such, the use of the Keep-alive
   Option extends the establishment and removal mechanism with a client-
   initiated mechanism to realize intermediate refreshments of the
   relationship.

   The Pledge Option allows a server to request a client to confirm its
   interest and the Keep-Alive option allows a client to request a
   server to confirm whether it is still an observer.  In case neither
   of the two options are supported, the only way for the client to
   ensure the relationship is still existing in the absence of incoming
   notifications is to periodically reestablish the relationship and the
   only way for the server to ensure the client is still interested is
   to send a confirmable notification from time to time.


7.  Discovery

   The Condition Option enables the establishment of well-defined set of
   conditional observations.  It is equally important for a resource to
   be able to announce in a well-defined way which conditional
   observations it supports.  Clients can then discover these
   capabilities and process them automatically.

   In [I-D.ietf-core-observe], the "obs" attribute is introduced as a
   target attribute.  It is used as a flag without any value, indicating
   that the resource is observable.  In order to describe the
   conditional observe capabilities of a resource, a value is added to
   the obs attribute.  To describe which of the 2^5 possible condition
   types a resource supports, a 32-bit value is used where a bit-value
   of 1 at position X (starting from 0 and from right to left) indicates
   that the condition type X is supported.  As such, by a client can
   discover the supported observe capabilities by parsing the value of
   the "obs" attribute.  In case no value is present, the "obs"
   attribute preserves its original meaning.

8.  Examples

   This section gives a number of short examples with message flows to
   illustrate the use of Condition Option in a observe GET request.
   Note that, in order to keep the figures readable, the Condition
   Option that is included in every notification is not shown.

   The first example (Figure 3) shows that the client sets the Condition
   Option to Type: 1 - No Value (1/-).  The condition is Time Series,
   meaning that the client wants to receive all state changes.  In case
   the state of the resource does not change, no notifications are sent,
   also not in case max-age expires.  We assume a max-age value of 60
   seconds.

           Figure 3: Condition Option with value 1/- (Time Series)

   The following example (Figure 4) shows that the client sets the
   Condition Option to Type: 2 - Value: 10 (2/10), This means that the
   server shall wait at least 10s between sending notification
   responses, indicating changes in the state of the resource, to the
   client.

   Figure 6 shows a client setting the Condition Option to Type: 4 -
   Value: 1 (4/1).  The server will now send notifications every time
   the change in state of the resource is at least 1.

   notifications to the client only if the resource value is bigger than
   23.

             Figure 9: Condition Option with value 9/30 (Periodic)

   In the following examples, we illustrate the combination of different
   conditions.  The example in Figure 10 shows the client adds two range
   Condition Options in the request, one set to 6/5, another one set to
   5/15.  It means that the range is within 5 and 15, i.e. value > 5 AND
   value < 15.  Since it is an AND condition, the two conditions can be
   specified in the same observe with multiple options.

       Figure 10: Two Condition Options to define in-side a range option
                 6/5 AND 5/15 (AllValues> AND AllValues<)

   The last example (Figure 11) shows the client adds two Observe
   request messages to build a range, one sets to 6/22, another one sets
   to 5/16.  It means that the range is out of range between 16 and 22,
   i.e. value > 22 OR value < 16.  This requires two messages, since it
   is the OR option, which is defined with multiple observe messages.
   An example of the application for this option can be found in the
   implementation of the conditional observer [SENSORS].

   Further, in [CPSCOM], an evaluation can be found regarding the
   feasibility of implementing conditional observations on real
   constrained devices, together with a basic performance comparison
   between conditional observe (server-filtering) and normal observe in
   combination with client-side filtering.

11.2.  Condition type registry

   The Condition types defined in this draft are identified by a string,
   such as "Step".  In order to minimize the overhead of using these
   condition types, this document defines a registry for the condition
   types to be used in CoAP and assigns each a numeric identifier.

   Each entry in the registry must include the condition type registered
   with IANA, the numeric identifier in the range 0-31 to be used for
   that condition type in CoAP, and a reference to a document defining
   the usage of that condition type.

   Initial entries in this registry are as follows:

Appendix A.  Alternative approaches

   In this appendix, we include some alternative solutions the authors
   have discussed regarding cancellation of relationships and the
   logical combination of different relationships.  The mechanisms
   described here allow more flexibility, but introduce additional
   (undesired?) complexity.  We put their description in this appendix
   to trigger further discussion and provide more background.

A.1.  Annex: Cancellation flag

   An alternative way to allow the explicit establishment and removal of
   conditional relationships and to allow the establishment of multiple
   conditional relationships to the same server using the same source
   transport address, is through the introduction of a 1 bit
   cancellation flag (C) as part of the 1 byte condition header.  The
   following paragraphs describe how this flag would change this

   behavior.

   C: The cancellation flag, when used in an observe request, indicates
   whether the client wants to establish a conditional observation
   relationship (0) or cancel an existing conditional relationship (1).
   In the initial response, the server uses the same value as in the
   request.  In all further notifications, this flag has no meaning and
   must be 0.  In case of a request containing multiple Condition
   Options, the client must use the same value of the C flag in all
   Condition Options.  The cancellation flag allows a client to
   establish multiple conditional observation relationships and remove
   individual relationships from the same address and port.

   When using this cancellation flag, a client is able to establish
   multiple conditional relationships using the same source transport
   address.  Different from [I-D.ietf-core-observe] a GET without
   observe issued by a client, will not result in the the removal of
   established conditional relationships.  Instead the client has the
   possibility to explicitly terminate any established conditional
   relationship by sending the same observe request, but with the
   Condition Option having the C flag set in order to trigger the
   cancellation of the request.  This way, the same end point can manage
   multiple conditional observation relationships without the risk of
   accidentally removing them.

   When a server receives a cancellation request, it removes the
   relationship indicated by the Condition Option and sends back a
   response containing both the Observe and the Condition Option with
   the cancellation flag set to 1.

   In case a client wants to terminate all existing conditional
   observation relationships with a server, it should send a request
   with Condition Option, where the Condition Type is set to the
   reserved value 0 and the cancellation flag to 1.  Upon reception of
   this message, the server removes all existing relationships and sends
   back a response containing the same Condition Type.

   In case a client has established a conditional relationship that is
   the result of a request with multiple Condition Options, the client
   can cancel this relationship by sending the same request, but now
   with all cancellation flags set to 1.

   If the server is for whatever reason not able to further fulfill the
   conditional relationship of a client, the server can also send a
   confirmable notification containing the Condition Option with the C
   flag set to 1 in order to terminate the observation relationship.

A.2.  Annex: Logic flag

   Different condition types can be combined in a request to express a
   logical AND relationship.  By default, logical OR of condition types
   is always supported through sending separate requests.  In order to
   express an out-of-range condition (notification when value is lower
   than X OR higher than Y), two separate conditional observe requests
   have to be sent.  Through the introduction of a 1 bit logic flag (L)
   as part of the 1 byte condition header, this can be avoided.

   L: The logic flag in a Condition Option indicates how the condition
   should be combined logically with the condition in the next Condition
   Option.  A value of 0 means AND and a value of 1 means OR.  The flag
   has no meaning if the Condition Option is the only or last Condition
   Option in the request.  Through the use of the L flag it is possible
   to logically combine different conditions in a single request (e.g.
   C1 AND C2 OR C3 AND C4).  As a drawback, when used, it complicates
   processing at the server side.

   This example (Figure 12) shows the same example from the (Figure 11)
   but with this alternative.  This example presents as the client adds
   two Observe options to build a range, one set to 6/22, another one
   set to 5/16.  It means that the range is out of range between 16 and
   22, i.e. value > 22 OR value < 16.  The first option is defined by
   default with the Logic flag equal to 0.  The second option is defined
   with the the Logic flag equal to 1, since it is the OR option.  Note
   as it has been simplified from two messages to only one message with
   two options, and the most important, it has avoided the management of
   multiple ports.
