Internet-Draft        Turning off IPv4 Using DHCPv6            July 2012


1.  Introduction

   When a dual-stack host makes a DHCPv4 request, it typically
   interprets the absence of a response as a failure condition.  This
   makes it difficult to deploy such nodes in an IPv6-only network.

   Take for example a home router that is dual-stack capable but
   provisioned with an IPv6-only WAN connection.  When the router boots,
   it typically assigns an IPv4 address to its LAN interface, starts
   services on that interface, and starts handing out IPv4 addresses to
   clients on the LAN by answering DHCPv4 requests.  This is done
   unconditionally, without taking the status of the IPv4 connectivity
   on the WAN interface into account.  Hosts on the LAN, in turn,
   install a default route pointing to the router and start behaving as
   if IPv4 connectivity was available.  IPv4 packets destined to the
   Internet get dropped at the router and timeouts happen.  The end
   result is that IPv4 remains fully active on the LAN and on the router
   itself even when it is desired that it be turned off.

   A new mechanism is needed to indicate the absence of IPv4
   connectivity.  Given that the goal is turning off IPv4, this new
   signaling mechanism shall be transported over IPv6.  Therefore, we
   introduce a new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] option for the purpose of explicitly
   indicating to the DHCPv6 client that IPv4 connectivity is
   unavailable.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are also used in this document:

   Upstream Interface:  An interface on which the No-IPv4 DHCPv6 option
      is received by a DHCPv6 client.


3.  The No-IPv4 Option

3.1.  Wire Format

   The No-IPv4 DHCPv6 option is used to signal the unavailability of
   IPv4 connectivity.  The format of the No-IPv4 option is:

     option-code     OPTION_NO_IPV4 (TBD).

     option-len      1.

     v4-level        Level of IPv4 functionality.

   The DHCPv6 client MUST place the OPTION_NO_IPV4 option code in the
   Option Request Option ([RFC3315] section 22.7).  Servers MAY include
   the option in responses (if they have been so configured).  Servers
   MAY also place the OPTION_NO_IPV4 option code in an Option Request
   Option contained in a Reconfigure message.

3.2.  Semantics

   The option applies to the link on which it is received by the DHCPv6
   client.  It is used to indicate to the client that it should disable
   some or all of its IPv4 functionality.  What should be disabled
   depends on the value of v4-level.

   v4-level can take the following values:

   0 - IPv4 fully enabled:  This is equivalent to the absence of the No-
      IPv4 option.  It is included here so that a DHCPv6 server can
      explicitly re-enable IPv4 access by including it in a Reply
      message following a Reconfigure.

   1 - No IPv4 upstream, local IPv4 permitted:  Any kind of IPv4
      connectivity is unavailable on the link on which the option is
      received.  Therefore, any attempts to provision IPv4 by the host
      or to use IPv4 in any fashion, on that link, will be useless.
      IPv4 MAY be dropped, blocked, or otherwise ignored on that link.

      Upon reception of the No-IPv4 option with value 1, the following
      IPv4 functionality MUST be disabled on the Upstream Interface:

      A.  IPv4 addresses MUST NOT be assigned.

      B.  Currently-assigned IPv4 addresses MUST be unassigned.

      C.  Dynamic configuration of link-local IPv4 addresses [RFC3927]
          MUST be disabled.

      D.  IPv4, ICMPv4, or ARP packets MUST NOT be sent.

      E.  IPv4, ICMPv4, or ARP packets received MUST be ignored.

      F.  DNS A queries MUST NOT be sent, even transported over IPv6.

      If all DHCPv6-configured interfaces receive the No-IPv4 option
      with value 1 or 2, and no other interface provides IPv4
      connectivity to the Internet, IPv4 is partially shut down, leaving
      only local connectivity active.  On the Upstream Interface, IPv4
      MUST be shut down as listed above.  On other interfaces, IPv4
      addresses MUST NOT be assigned except for the following:

      *  Loopback (127.0.0.0/8)

      *  Link Local (169.254.0.0/16) [RFC3927]

      *  Private-Use (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)
         [RFC1918]

   2 - No IPv4 at all:  This is intended to be a stricter version of the
      above.

      The host or router running the DHCPv6 client that receives this
      option MUST disable IPv4 functionality on the Upstream Interface
      in the same way as for value 1.

      If all DHCPv6-configured interfaces received the No-IPv4 option
      with exclusively value 2, and no other interface provides IPv4
      connectivity to the Internet, IPv4 is completely shut down.  In
      particular:

      A.  IPv4 address MUST NOT be assigned to any interface.

      B.  Currently-assigned IPv4 addresses MUST be unassigned.

      C.  Dynamic configuration of link-local IPv4 addresses [RFC3927]
          MUST be disabled.

      D.  IPv4, ICMPv4, or ARP packets MUST NOT be sent on any
          interface.

      E.  IPv4, ICMPv4, or ARP packets received on any interface MUST be
          ignored.

      F.  In the above, "any interface" includes loopback interfaces.
          In particular, the 127.0.0.1 special address MUST be removed.

      G.  Server programs listening on IPv4 addresses (e.g., a DHCPv4
          server) MAY be shut down.

      H.  DNS A queries MUST NOT be sent, even transported over IPv6.

      I.  If the host or router also runs a DHCPv6 server, it SHOULD
          include the No-IPv4 option with value 2 in DHCPv6 responses it
          sends to clients that request it, unless prohibited by local
          policy.  If it currently has active clients, it SHOULD send a
          Reconfigure to each of them with the OPTION_NO_IPV4 included
          in the Option Request Option.

      The intent is to remove all traces of IPv4 activity.  Once the No-
      IPv4 option with value 2 is activated, the network stack should
      behave as if IPv4 functionality had never been present.  For
      example, a modular kernel implementation could accomplish the
      above by unloading the IPv4 kernel module at run time.

3.3.  Example

   A dual-stack home gateway is set up with a single WAN uplink and is
   configured to use DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 to automatically obtain IPv4 and
   IPv6 connectivity.  On the LAN side, it has one link with multiple
   hosts.

   When it boots, the router assigns 192.168.1.1/24 to its LAN
   interfaces and starts a DHCPv4 server listening on it.  It hands out
   addresses 191.168.1.100-199 to clients.  It also starts an IPv6
   Router Advertisement daemon as well as a stateless DHCPv6 server,
   also listening on the LAN interfaces.

   On the WAN side, it starts two provisioning procedures in parallel:
   one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.

   At this point, the ISP does not know if the router supports IPv6-only
   operation.  Therefore, by default, the ISP responds to DHCPv4
   requests as usual.

   As part of the IPv6 provisioning procedure, the router sends a DHCPv6
   request containing OPTION_NO_IPV4 in an Option Request Option.  The
   ISP's DHCPv6 server's reply includes the No-IPv4 option with value 2.
   When this procedure finishes, the ISP has determined that this
   customer will run in IPv6-only mode and starts dropping all IPv4
   packets at the first hop.  If an IPv4 address was assigned, it is
   reclaimed, and possibly reassigned to another subscriber.

Internet-Draft        Turning off IPv4 Using DHCPv6            July 2012


   The home router aborts the IPv4 provisioning procedure (if it is
   still running) and deactivates all IPv4 functionality.  It shuts down
   its DHCPv4 server.  It also configures its own stateless DHCPv6
   server to send the No-IPv4 option to clients that request it.

   As an optimization, the router could delay setting up IPv4 by a few
   seconds (10 seconds seems reasonable).  If the IPv6 procedure
   completes with the No-IPv4 option during that time, IPv4 will never
   have been set up and the router will operate in pure IPv6-only mode
   from the start.


4.  Open Issues

   o  A legacy IPv4-only device connected to a network running in mode 2
      (no IPv4 at all) will presumably keep retrying forever, e.g.
      sending DHCPDISCOVER messages endlessly.  Do we want a way to
      signal to that host that IPv4 will never be available?  But since
      that device was not updated for IPv6, it is doubtful that it would
      be updated to understand this new signaling.  Could we reuse/
      overload some existing signaling that would have the same effect?


5.  Security Considerations

   One security concern is that an attacker could use the No-IPv4 option
   to deny IPv4 access to a victim.  However, unprotected vanilla DHCP
   can already be exploited to cause such a denial of service ([RFC2131]
   section 7).

   TO BE COMPLETED


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD with description OPTION_NO_IPV4
   in the "DHCP Option Codes" table which is part of the dhcpv6-
   parameters registry [1].
