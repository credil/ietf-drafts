Internet-Draft              URN EES Namespace               October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The European Emergency Number Association (EENA) is currently in the
   process of setting standards, processes, and procedures for the use
   of an IP-based Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) for all public
   safety entities in Europe.  Some of the solutions being developed by
   EENA require namespaces that are managed so that they are unique and
   persistent.  To assure that the uniqueness is absolute, the
   registration of a specific Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141]
   Namespace ID (NID) for use by EENA is required.  This document
   defines and registers such a namespace in accordance with the
   procedures in [RFC3406].

2.  URN Specification for 'ees' NID

      Namespace ID: ees

      Registration information:


         Registration version number: 1

         Registration date: 2012-09-26

      Declared registrant of the namespace:


         Registering organization

         Name: European Emergency Number Association (EENA)

         Address:


            Avenue de la Toison d'Or 79,

            1060 Brussels

            Belgium

      Designated contact:


         Role: European Emergency Services Registry Administrator

         Email: eesr-admin@eena.org

      Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
      "eena" NID will have the following structure: {EESclass}:
      {ClassSpecificString}

      The "EESclass" conforms to the URN syntax requirements [RFC2141]
      and defines a specific class of resource type.  Each class will
      have a specific labeling scheme that is covered by
      "ClassSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming
      requirements of [RFC2141].

      EENA maintains a naming authority, the European Emergency Service
      Registry (EESR), that will manage the assignment of "EESclass" and

Internet-Draft              URN EES Namespace               October 2012


      the specific registration values assigned for each class.  Other
      EENA standards documents will define the "ClassSpecificStrings"
      for a given "EESclass".

      Relevant ancillary documentation:

      The European Emergency Service Registry (EESR) provides
      information on the registered resources and the registrations for
      each.  More information about the EESR and the registration
      activities and procedures to be followed are defined in the "EENA
      Registry System Standard" [EENA-RSS].

      Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The EESR will manage resources using the "ees" NID and will be the
      authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings
      associated.  The EESR shall ensure the uniqueness of all ees URNs
      by checking such names against the list of existing namespace
      names, as documented in [EENA-RSS].

      Identifier persistence considerations:

      The EESR will provide clear documentation of the registered uses
      of the "ees" NID.  The EESR will establish a registry for
      "EESclass", as defined in [EENA-RSS].  Each "EESclass" will have a
      separate description in the registry and may have its own sub-
      registry.  In particular, new "EESclass" registry entries will
      require a full EENA Technical Standard document.

      The EESR will maintain a website at a stable address that provides
      XML and text renderings of the urn:ees registry.

      Process of identifier assignment:

      The EESR processes and procedures for identifier assignment are
      documented in [EENA-RSS].  The registry that will control the
      urn:ees namespace is defined in [EENA-RSS].  In particular,
      assignments to the "EESclass" registry will require a EENA
      Technical Standard document.  Subregistries for particular
      "EENAclasses" may be established by such technical standards.
      Subregistries may be defined to have more liberal management
      policies as defined in [EENA-RSS], but must be EESR managed and
      will not be permitted to be delegated to any other organization or
      registry.  Thus, the EESR will manage the entire urn:ees tree.

      Process for identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery

      System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace prohibits the future
      definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing with an
      RDS.

      Rules for lexical equivalence:

      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
      [RFC2141] apply.

      Conformance with URN syntax:

      No special considerations.

      Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of EENA activities.

      Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following examples are representative URNs that could be assigned
   by the ERS.  They may not be the actual strings that would be
   assigned.

   Resource "psaproute"

   Syntax: "urn:ees:emergencyresponders:<responder name>"

   ResourceSpecificString: simple string with name of responder, defined
   in a subregistry

   Use: Defines the URN to be used for queries to an NG112 Emergency
   Call Routing Function that provides URIs for responding agencies.

   Examples:

   urn:ees:emergencyresponders:ambulance

   urn:ees:emergencyresponders:fire

   urn:ees:emergencyresponders:police

   urn:ees:emergencyresponders:poison

   urn:ees:emergencyresponders:coastguard

   urn:ees:emergencyresponders:marine

4.  Namespace Considerations

   The European Emergency Number Association is a Brussels-based NGO set
   up in 1999 dedicated to promoting high-quality emergency services
   reached by the number 112 throughout the EU.  EENA serves as a
   discussion platform for emergency services, public authorities,
   decision makers, associations and solution providers in view of
   improving emergency response in accordance with citizens'
   requirements.  EENA is also promoting the establishment of an
   efficient system for alerting citizens about imminent or developing
   emergencies.

   The EENA memberships include about 655 emergency services
   representatives from 43 European countries, 56 solution providers, 9
   international associations/organisations as well as 26 Members of the
   European Parliament.

   EENA members do their work in committees, which also includes a
   technical committee that develops a variety of applications and
   services using Internet protocols built upon IETF standards.  Some of
   these services require that supporting information (e.g., data
   descriptions, attributes, etc.) be fully specified.  For proper
   operation, descriptions of the needed supporting information must
   exist and be available in a unique, reliable, and persistent manner.
   These dependencies provide the basis of the need for namespaces, in
   one form or another, and will enable EENA to define URNs that are to
   assign cleaner, more general, more permanent, more reliable, and more
   controllable namespace names related to EENA standards, while keeping
   URNs defined by EENA properly separate from the IETF-defined URNs.

   As the European Emergency Number Association work is ongoing and
   covers many technical areas, the possibility of binding to various
   other namespace repositories has been deemed impractical.  Each
   object or description, as defined in EENA, could possibly be related
   to multiple different namespaces, so further conflicts of association
   could occur.  Thus, the intent is to utilize the European Emergency
   Services Registry, operated by EENA, as the naming authority for
   EENA-defined objects and descriptions.

5.  Community Considerations

   The European public safety organizations will benefit from
   publication of this namespace by having permanent and reliable URNs
   to be used with protocols defined by EENA.  The objects and
   descriptions required for services defined by EENA are generally
   available for use by other organizations.  The European Emergency
   Number Association will provide access and support for name requests
   by these organizations within the constraints of the defined ERS
   processes and the specific urn:eena registry and subregistries.  This
   support can be enabled in a timely and responsive fashion as new
   objects and descriptions are produced.  These will be enabled in a
   fashion similar to current IANA processes, as documented in
   [EENA-RSS].

   The EESR establishes registries when called for in a EENA Technical
   Standard.  Such standards must provide clear and concise instructions
   on creating and maintaining such registries.  Defined management
   policies include "EENA Technical Standard Required", "EENA Document
   Required", "Expert Review", and "First Come First Served", which
   correspond to similar IANA management policies.  EENA is establishing
   a website that provides controlled entry of new registries and
   entries in registries, and automatically produces HTML and XML
   descriptions of registry contents that are used by vendors and other
   consumers of the content.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new entry in the URN Namespaces registry.  The
   namespace is "eena".  The defining document is this RFC.  The entry
   can be found in the Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces registry
   available from http://www.iana.org and any associated mirrors.

   We would like to thank Brian Rosen for his work on RFC 6061.  We have
   re-used his writeup since it aims to accomplish the same goal.  His
   work was focused on the National Emergency Number Association, a
   partner organization of EENA.
