Generic Naming Attributes for the Generic Security Services Application
                    Programming Interface (GSS-API)
           draft-williams-kitten-generic-naming-attributes-00

Abstract

   This document specifies several useful generic naming attributes for
   use with the Generic Security Services Application Programming
   Interface (GSS-API) Naming Extensions specified in RFC6680.

   These attributes allow applications to extract discrete components of
   a GSS-API "mechanism name" (MN) object: issuer (e.g., realm name,
   domain name, certification authority name), service and host names
   (for host-based service names), user names, and others.

1.  Introduction

   In RFC6680 [RFC6680] we introduced an interface by which to access
   "attributes" of names.  This document specifies some such attributes.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Generic Attributes

   We add a number of generic attributes.  Some of these attributes can
   be used as prefixes of other attributes.

2.1.  Concrete Attributes

   These attributes generally have a single value.  Only one of these
   attributes can also be used a prefix: the issuer name attribute.

2.1.1.  Issuer Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain a name of an issuer of a
   mechanism name (MN) or of an attribute of an MN.  The API name for
   this attribute is GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_ISSUERNAME, and it's actual
   attribute name is "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-issuername".

   The display form of issuer names is mechanism-specific.

   The [non-display] form of issuer names SHALL be the exported name
   token form of the issuer's name.  Not all mechanisms will support
   issuer names as MNs, therefore implementations MAY output a null non-
   display value.

   For example, for the Kerberos mechanism [RFC4121] an issuer name
   would generally (but not always!) be a Kerberos realm name, probably
   display as just the realm name.  (But note that there is not yet a
   Kerberos realm name as MN specification.)

   This attribute can be used as prefix of other attributes.  When used
   as a prefix, this attribute indicates that the application wishes to
   know the name of the issuer of the prefixed attribute of the given
   MN.

2.1.2.  User Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain the component of an MN naming
   a user.  The API name for this attribute is
   GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_USERNAME, and it's actual attribute name is
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-username".

   The display form of user names is mechanism-specific.

   The non-display form of user names is mechanism-specific.

2.1.3.  Service Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain the component of an MN naming
   a service as part of a host- or domain-based service name.  The API
   name for this attribute is GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_SERVICENAME, and it's
   actual attribute name is
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-servicename".

   The display and non-display forms of service names are the same: a
   character string corresponding to the service names used, for
   example, in calls to GSS_Import_name() with the
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE name-type.

2.1.4.  Host Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain the component of an MN naming
   a host as part of a host- or domain-based service name.  The API name
   for this attribute is GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_HOSTNAME, and it's actual
   attribute name is "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-hostname".

   The display form of a host name MAY be stylized and SHOULD use
   U-labels [RFC5890].

   The non-display form of host names SHOULD be a character string as
   described in [RFC1123], and SHOULD use A-labels [RFC5890].

2.1.5.  Domain Name

   We add an attribute by which to obtain the component of an MN naming
   a domain as part of a domain-based service name.  The API name for
   this attribute is GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_DOMAINNAME, and it's actual
   attribute name is "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-domainname".

   The display form of a domain name MAY be stylized and SHOULD use
   U-labels [RFC5890].

   The non-display form of domain names SHOULD be a character string as
   described in [RFC1035], and SHOULD use A-labels [RFC5890].

2.2.  Prefix Attributes

   GSS_Get_name_attribute() using attributes described in the preceding
   section SHALL fail if there are any name constraints that can be
   applied to the issuers of those names and, in applying those
   constraints, it is discovered that the issuer was not permitted to
   issue credentials for the MN.

   For example, a Kerberos realm named "FOO.EXAMPLE" might not be

   expected to issue credentials (tickets, keys) to host-based service
   names for hosts not ending in ".foo.example" or which are not
   "foo.example".

   Several generic attribute prefixes are described below for overriding
   this behavior.

2.2.1.  GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_UNCONSTRAINED

   This attribute prefix, named GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_UNCONSTRAINED in the
   API, and with an actual name of
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-gen-unconstrained", indicates
   that the application wants the value of the prefixed attribute
   without any name constraint checking.

2.2.2.  GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_UNCONSTRAINED_OK

   This attribute prefix, named GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_UNCONSTRAINED_OK in
   the API, and with an actual name of
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-gen-unconstrained-ok",
   indicates that the application wants the value of the prefixed
   attribute regardless of any applicable naming constraints, but to
   indicate the name constraint status via the 'authenticated' output
   parameter of the GSS_Get_name_attribute() interface.

2.2.3.  GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_FAST

   This attribute prefix, named GSS_C_ATTR_GENERIC_FAST in the API, and
   with an actual name of
   "urn:ietf:id:ietf-kitten-name-attrs-00-gen-fast", indicates that the
   application requires that the mechanism not perform any slow
   operations (e.g., connecting to a directory for the purposes of name
   constraint validation) in obtaining the prefixed attribute of the
   given MN.

3.  Local Name Attributes

   Normally an Internet specification would not be expected to specify
   any local name attributes of GSS names.  However, there is one common
   and very useful local name attribute, which we specify below.
   Implementations are free to use different names for this attribute or
   exclude it altogether -- it is a local name attribute, after all.

3.1.  GSS_C_ATTR_LOCAL_LOGIN_USER

   This attribute, with suggested API name GSS_C_ATTR_LOCAL_LOGIN_USER,
   and suggested actual name "local-login-user", requests a local user
   name corresponding to the given MN, if any.

   Obtaining the local user name corresponding to an MN may require
   complex name mapping or lookup operations that are completely
   implementation-defined.

4.  Suggested Mechanism-Specific Name Attributes (INFORMATIONAL)

   [[anchor1: This section should really be split out into separate

   o  components (ordered set of components of a principal name)

   o  transit path (ordered set of realm and CA names)

   o  specific authorization data elements

   o  PKINIT client certificate

   o  session key enctype
