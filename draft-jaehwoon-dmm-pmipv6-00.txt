Abstract

   This draft proposes a PMIPv6-based distributed mobility management
   by distributing the Localized Mobility Anchor (LMA) function to
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAGs). Here, the MAG that an MN firstly 
   connects to the PMIPv6 domain becomes the MN's LMA, and other MAGs 
   can find the address of the LMA of MN by using the address assigned 
   to the MN.

1.  Introduction


   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is considered as the network-based 
   mobility management mechanism that the access network within the 
   PMIPv6 domain supports the mobility of the mobile node (MN) on behalf
   of the MN itself [1]. In PMIPv6, the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) is 
   defined to support the mobility of an MN. The MAG acts as the default
   gateway of the access link to which an MN is connected. Also, the 
   Localized Mobility Anchor (LMA) is defined as the Home Agent within 
   the PMIPv6 domain.

   In PMIPv6, traffic exchanged between all MNs and their corresponding 
   nodes (CNs) goes through the LMA and therefore the PMIPv6 protocol 
   has several potential problems such as a single node failure and 
   congestion due to traffic concentration [2].

   In this draft, we propose the PMIPv6 based distributed mobility 
   management by distributing LMA function to MAGs. Here, the MAG that 
   an MN firstly connects to the PMIPv6 domain becomes the MN's LMA, and 
   other MAGs can find the address of the LMA of MN by using the address 
   assigned to the MN.

                  Figure 1: Message exchange scenario


   Figure 1 shows the message exchange scenario considered in this 
   draft. It is assumed that a network prefix "PREF" is allocated to the 
   PMIPv6 domain and a different sub-network prefix belonging to "PREF" 
   is allocated to a different MAG. In figure 1, it is assumed that 
   a sub-network prefix "PREF1" is allocated to the MAG1 and another 
   sub-network prefix "PREF2" is allocated to the MAG2. Even though a 
   different sub-network prefix is allocated to a different MAG, all the 
   MAGs advertise the same network prefix "PREF" through their 
   interfaces providing PMIPv6 service.

   When an MN enters an PMIPv6 domain and firstly connects to a MAG 
   (say, MAG1), MAG1 transmits Router Advertisement (RA) message by 
   setting "M" flag in order for the MN to configure the address 
   statefully [4]. The RA message contains the prefix information option 
   with "PREF". MN transmits a DHCP request message to the MAG1 for 
   configuring an address to its interface. MAG1 receiving the DHCP 
   request message considers that the MN firstly connects to the PMIPv6 
   domain, assigns an address belonging to "PREF1" and transmits a DHCP 
   response message to the MN. MN receiving the DHCP response message

   sets the IPv6 address contained in the DHCP response message to its 
   interface, and from now on, MN can communicate with a node within the 
   Internet.

   If MN moves from MAG1 to MAG2, MAG1 can know that the MN is 
   disconnected to the MAG1 by using the layer-2 information. MAG2 
   transmit the RA message containing "PREF" network prefix information 
   to MN. The MN receiving the RA message considers that it still 
   resides in the same network and continues to use the assigned 
   address. The MAG2 checks the first packet sent by the MN. If the 
   first packet contains DHCP request message, then the MAG2 considers 
   that the MN firstly connects to the PMIPv6 domain. Otherwise, MAG2 
   considers that the MN moves from another MAG domain and transmits a 
   DPBU (Distributed Proxy Binding Update) message. The source address 
   of the DPBU message is set to the address of MAG2 and the destination 
   address is set to the MN's address. MAG2 can know the address of the 
   MN by using source address of the packet transmitted by the MN. 
   The DPBU message is transmitted to the MAG1 by using the normal 
   routing procedure within PMIPv6 infrastructure. MAG2 receiving the 
   DPBU message checks whether the MN is currently conncted to it 
   (say, 1-hop neighbor). If not, MAG1 creates the Binding Cache Entry 
   (BCE) for the MN, establishes the tunnel with the MAG2 and transmits 
   a DPBA (Distributed Proxy Binding Acknowledgement) message. The 
   source address of the DPBA message is set to the address of MAG1 and 
   the destination address is set to the address of MAG2. Moreover, the
   DPBA message contains the address of the MN. MAG2 receiving the DPBA 
   message establishes the tunnel with the MAG1. From now on, MN can 
   continue to exchange the traffic with any host within the Internet.
