    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a summary of the IAB/IRTF Workshop on 'Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Communication', which took place in Vancouver, Canada, on July 28, 2012. The main goal of the workshop was to foster a discussion on congestion control mechanisms for interactive real-time communication. This report summarizes the discussions and lists the conclusions and recommendations to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community. The views and positions in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect the views and positions of the authors, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) or the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Any application that sends significant amounts of data over the Internet is expected to implement reasonable congestion control behavior. Although the specific mechanisms depend on the application or protocol, the motivations for congestion control are well understood and documented in RFC 2914 <xref target="RFC2914"/> and RFC 5405  <xref target="RFC5405"/>. The goals are:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Preventing congestion collapse.</t>
<t>Allowing multiple flows to share the network fairly.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The Internet has been used for interactive real-time communication for decades, most of which is being transmitted using RTP over UDP, often over provisioned capacity and/or using only rudimentary congestion control mechanisms.</t>

<t>The development and upcoming widespread deployment of web-based real-time media communication - where RTP is used to and from web browsers to transmit audio, video and data - will likely result in substantial new Internet traffic. Due to the projected volume of this traffic, as well as the fact that it is more likely to use unprovisioned capacity, it is essential that it is transmitted with robust and effective congestion control mechanisms.</t>

<t>Designing congestion control mechanisms that perform well under a wide variety of traffic mixes and over network paths with widely varying characteristics is not easy. Prevention of congestion collapse can be achieved through "circuit breaker" mechanisms, but for media flows that are supposed to coexist with a user's other ongoing communication sessions, a congestion control mechanism that shares capacity fairly in the presence of a mix of TCP, UDP and other protocol flows is needed.</t>

<t>Many additional complications arise. Here are some examples:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Real-time interactive media sessions require low latencies, whereas streaming media can use large play-out buffers.</t>
<t>RTCP feedback about an RTP session typically arrives much less frequently than, for example, TCP ACKs for a given TCP connection. The RTP/RTCP control loop can lead to a longer reaction time.</t>
<t>Media codecs can usually only adjust their output rates in a much more coarse-grained fashion than, for example, TCP, and user experience suffers if encoding rates are switched too frequently. Codecs typically have a minimum sending rate as well.</t>
<t>Some bits of an encoded media stream are more important than others. For example, losing or dropping an I-frame of a video stream is more problematic than dropping a P-frame.</t>
<t>Ramping up the transmission rate can be problematic. Simply increasing the output rate of the codec without knowledge whether the network path can sustain transmission at the increased rate runs the danger of incurring a significant amount of packet loss that can cause playback artifacts.</t>
<t>A congestion control scheme for interactive media needs to handle bundles of interrelated flows (audio, video, data), in a way that accommodates the preferences of the application in the event of congestion.</t>
<t>The desire to provide a congestion control mechanism that can be efficiently implemented inside an application (e.g., a web server and a browser) imposes additional restrictions.</t>
<t>There are explicit congestion signals (such as ECN), and there are indirect indications of congestion (such as packet delay and loss). However, congestion is not the only source of these indirect signals. Care must be taken to account for each of these signals, particularly if various applications react on the same signals.</t>
<t>Network elements and end device operating systems often create buffers to better support TCP-based applications. These buffers introduce additional communication delay, which harms the small delay budget available for real-time applications.</t>
</list> 
</t>

      <t>Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.
        The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop
        participants and do not necessarily reflect the views of the
        authors.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="History and Current Status">
<t>The currently deployed RTP-based RTC systems use congestion control schemes that are ad hoc at best. As the Internet moves towards an RTCWeb standard for interoperable audio/video conferencing, it needs a standardized and most importantly effective mechanism for congestion control.</t>

<t>The most immediate need is for a control mechanism that balances a real-time flow
fairly among other competing traffic. For instance, under congested conditions, it
would be inappropriate to use far more bandwidth than flows from other applications
are using, particularly lasting gross over-utilization of
the network.  Simple "circuit breaker" -style control mechanisms can prevent congestion collapse by
disabling a circuit that far exceeds a fair share and making the circuit remain disabled for some time.
But does not in any way enable concurrent flows to share available network capacity sensibly.</t>

<!-- 
<t>The most immediate need is for a circuit breaker mechanism that stops a flow when serious anomalies are detected, i.e., when it is using an order of magnitude more bandwidth than a TCP flow would use over the given path <xref target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers"/>. This prevents the RTCWeb flows from causing long lasting gross over-utilization of the network. Circuit breakers can prevent congestion collapse if used correctly, i.e., if the circuit remains disabled for some time after the breaker triggers, but does not in any way enable concurrent flows to share available network capacity sensibly.</t>
--> 

<t>Therefore, in addition to circuit breakers, more complete methods for media congestion control are needed. The focus of the workshop was on discussing ideas for these more complete congestion control methods.Note that the primary focus of the workshop is RTCWeb-style audio/video flows. The assumed underlying flows (in most attendees minds) were digital audio/video data encapsulated in RTP over UDP over IP. Most of the concepts presented at the workshop could be used with different media types over different transports, but this was the generally assumed baseline for discussions.</t>
    </section>
	
	<section title="Recommendations">
	<t>The participants suggested to explore two complementary solution tracks, as described in the two sub-sections below.</t>
	
	<section title="Changes to Network Infrastructure"> 

	<t>Like for all other traffic on the network, better data plane infrastructure improves the perceived quality of the best-effort service the Internet provides for RTCWeb flows. The IETF has already developed several technologies that would be of immediate usefulness, if they were deployed. The workshop participants expressed the hope that due to the volume and importance of RTCWeb traffic, some of these technologies might finally see widespread use.</t>
	
	<t>The first and by far most important improvement is traffic segregation, i.e., the ability to use different queues for different traffic types. Specifically jitter/delay sensitive and throughput maximizing protocols need to be in different queues. It is not possible for a single queue/AQM to be optimal for both.</t>

<t>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) allows routers along the end-to-end path to signal the onset of congestion and allows applications to respond early, avoiding losses and keep queue sizes short and therefore end-to-end delay low. ECN is implemented on some end system stacks and routers, but frequently not enabled.</t>

<t>Different mechanisms have been developed to facilitate traffic segregation. Differentiated services are one possibility in this space if applications start to mark outgoing traffic appropriately and routers would segregate traffic accordingly, browsers could more directly control the relative importance of their various flows, and avoid self-competition. Compared to ECN, however, DiffServ is far more difficult to deploy meaningfully end-to-end, especially given that DSCPs have no defined end-to-end meaning and packets can be re-marked. Quality-of-service (QoS) signaling together with resource reservation facilities would enable a fine-grained and flexible way to indicate resource needs to network elements but it is also by far the most heavyweight proposal, and unlikely to be viable in the global Internet.</t>

<t>However, any change to network infrastructure will take time particularly if the interest of the involved stakeholders is not aligned (as it is the case for network operators and over-the-top application providers). It is therefore imperative that RTCWeb congestion control provides adequate improvement in the absence of any of the aforementioned schemes.
</t>
	</section> 
	
	
	<section title="Avoiding Self-Inflicted Queuing"> 
	<t>This approach tries to ensure that the network does not get congested by focusing on the traffic sent by a single host independent of any changes to networks, as mentioned in the earlier chapter. A single congestion manager within the end host or the browser could already help to coordinate various congestion control activities and to ensure a more coordinated approach between different applications, and different flows.</t>
	
	<t>The following activities were suggested during the workshop.</t>
	
	<t>	<list style="hanging">
	
	<t hangText="Reacting to all Congestion Signals:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
   To initiate the congestion control process it is important to detect
   congestion in the communication path.  Congestion in the
   comminication can be detected using either an explicit mechanism or
   an implicit mechanism.  The explicit mechanism involves direct
   congestion signaling usually from the congested network node, such as
   ECN. The ECN bits are set in the IP header by the network node
   before it starts to drop the packets and gives end hosts to react to
   the congestion.  In case of implicite mechanism, a particular
   characteristics or event in the network traffic can be inferred as a
   congestion signal.  For example, packet loss events or observed
   delay increase or jitter in the communication path can be taken as an
   implicit congestion signals. These measurements can also be made available 
   in a variety of different protocols, such as RTCP reports or transport 
   protocols. Communication endpoints can trigger congestion
   control on the event of these phenomena.  It is also possible to
   correlate these events to detect congestion in the communication
   path.  The implicit and explicit signals can come in any sequence and
   at any time during the ongoing media session. It is recommended to
   react to all the possible implicit congestion signals, ideally from all 
   applications at the end host,  to avoid self-
   inflicted queues.</t>
   
   <t hangText="Delay- and Loss-based Algorithms:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
   The main goal of designing a congestion control algorithm for
   real-time conversational media is to achieve low latency.  An
   explicit signaling based congestion control algorithm perhaps is the
   best fit for this purpose as the network nodes are directly involved
   in the process.  However, in case of absence of ECN support in the
   end-to-end communication path delay based algorithms are needed where
   the increased delay in the communication path is taken into account
   as implicit congestion signal. While it is difficult to design
   algorithms based on delay since many wireless networks show a wide delay
   variation even in a non-congested network. The workshop participants 
   recommended that more research should be done to better understand 
   non-congestion related delay variation in the network. General consensus 
   among the workshop participants was that when latency-based techniques 
   were competing against loss-based techniques, the loss-based techniques 
   got all the bandwidth.</t>
 
   <t hangText="Algorithm Evaluation:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
   The Internet consists of heterogeneous networks, which also includes 
   misconfigured, and unmanaged network nodes. Bandwidth and latency varies 
   a lot. Not only this, different services deployed using RTP/UDP have 
   different requirements in terms of media quality. A congestion control 
   algorithm needs to perform well not only in simulators but also in 
   today's Internet.  To achieve this it is recommended to test the 
   algorithms with real-world loss and delay figures to be sure that the 
   desired audio/video rates are attainable using the proposed algorithms 
   for the desired services.</t>
   
   <t hangText="Media Characteristics in Focus:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
   Interactive real-time voice and video data is inherently variable.  
   Usually the content of the media and service requirements dictate the 
   media coding.  The codec may be bursty and not all frames are equally 
   important (e.g., I-frames are more important than P-frames). Thus, 
   codecs have limited room for adaptation. Congestion control for audio 
   and video codecs is therefore different to congestion control applied 
   for bulk transfers. The latter are allows buffering of media irrespective 
   to their content and more fine-grained control for a congestion control 
   algorithm.  In the workshop these limitations were brought up and 
   the workshop participants recommended that a congestion controller needs
   to be aware of these constraints. However, further investigation is 
   needed to decide what information needs to be exchanged between a codec 
   and the congestion manager.</t>
  
  <t hangText="Startup Behaviour:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
   The startup media quality is very important for real-time interactive
   application and for user-perceived application performance. The startup
   behavior of these is also different to other traffic. By nature the 
   real-time interactive communication applications want to provide a 
   smooth user experience and maintain best media quality to ease the 
   interaction. While it may be desirable from a user experience point of 
   view to immediately start streaming video with high-definition quality 
   and audio of a wideband codec this will have impacts on the bandwidth of 
   the already ongoing flows. As such, it would be ideal to start slow enough 
   to avoid excessive congestion to other flows but fast enough to offer a 
   good user experience. The sweetspot, however, yet has to be found.</t>
 </list> 
 </t>
	<t>In addition, there were some discussions on how to make RTCWeb-style 
	flows fair to other RTCWeb-style flows, other TCP based flows, LEDBAT 
	flows, and other flows. This is a much more difficult problem than simply 
	making RTCWeb flows avoid congestion. Changing the way TCP is used in browsers 
	or other HTTP-based applications would already help, for example, by avoid 
    opening too many concurrent TCP connections, and improved interworking 
    with video streaming and file sharing software. The work on HTTP 2.0 
    with SPDY is already the step in the right direction since SPDY makes 
	makes use of a more aggressive form of multiplexing instead of opening 
	a larger number of TCP connections.</t>
