               Use of KCipher-2 in Transport Layer Security
                    draft-kiyomoto-kcipher2-tls-01.txt


Abstract

   This document offers a set of new cipher suit specifications to
   support KCipher-2 encryption in the Transport Layer Security protocol.
   KCipher-2 is a stream cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit
   initialization vector, which provides fast, efficient encryption and
   decryption.

Internet-Draft          Use of KCipher-2 in TLS          September 2011


   carefully, as they describe your rights and restrictions with respect
   to this document.

1. Introduction

   Cryptographic operations used in TLS can be categorized in five ways:
   digital signing, stream cipher encryption, block cipher encryption,
   authenticated encryption with additional data encryption, and public
   key encryption [TLS]. This document defines the cipher suites to use
   KCipher-2 for stream cipher encryption in TLS. KCipher-2 is a fast,
   secure stream cipher algorithm [KCipher2].

1.1. KCipher2

   KCipher-2 is a stream cipher algorithm with a 128-bit key and a 128-
   bit initialization vector (IV). The algorithm and other properties
   are described in [SECRYPT]. KCipher-2 has been evaluated by the
   cryptographic technique evaluation project for the Japanese e-
   Government [CRYPTEC]. KCipher-2 also has been submitted to another
   international standardization body [ISO18033].

1.2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

2. Cipher Suites Values

   The following are proposed identifiers and values for the cipher
   suites of TLS.

   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };


3. Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1. Key Exchange

   The RSA, DH_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA, and DH_anon key exchanges
   are executed as defined in [TLS].

3.2. Cipher

   The KCIPHER2_128 cipher suites use KCipher-2 with a 128-bit key and a
   128-bit initialization vector.

3.3. Hash and Pseudorandom Function

   For the cipher suites in this document, HMAC [HMAC] based on SHA-256
   is used for message integrity, and TLS PRF [TLS] with SHA-256 is used
   as the pseudorandom function.

4. Security Considerations

   As of the time this document was written, we are not aware of any
   attack on KCipher-2. No security vulnerabilities have been identified
   in the security evaluations by the KCipher-2 developers and other
   independent institutions [SECRYPT], [CRYPTEC10], [KDDI].

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the following numbers in the TLS Cipher
   Suite Registry:

   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
   CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_KCIPHER2_128_SHA_256 = { TBD, TBD };
