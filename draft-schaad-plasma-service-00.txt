2.  Components

2.1.  WS-Trust 1.3

   We use WS-Trust as the basis for the protocol presented in this
   document.  WS-Trust is a secure messaging protocol used for security
   token exchange to enable the issuance and dissemination of
   credentials within different trust domains.  WS-Trust 1.3 is
   specified by OASIS in [WS-TRUST].  WS-Trust is built on SOAP (see
   [SOAP12]) to provide a messaging structure.

2.2.  XACML 3.0

   The XACML specification (eXtensible Access Control Markup
   Language)[XACML] provides a framework for writing both access control
   policies and access control queries and responses.

                  Figure 1: Message Access Control Actors

   List the boxes above and give some info about them.

   Email Policy Service  is the gateway controller for accessing a
      message.  Although it is represented as a single box in the
      diagram, there is no reason for it to be in practice.  Each of the
      three protocols could be talking to different instances of a
      common system.  This would allow for a server to operated by
      Company A, but be placed in Company B's network thus reducing the
      traffic sent between the two networks.

   Mail Transfer Agent  is the entity or set of entities that is used to
      move the message from the sender to the receiver.  Although this
      document describes the process in terms of mail, any method can be
      used to transfer the message.

   Receiving Agent  is the entity that consumes the message.

   Sending Agent  is the entity that originates the message.

3.1.  Sender Processing

   We layout the general steps that need to be taken by the sender of an
   EPS message.  The numbers in the steps below refer to the numbers in
   the upper half of Figure 1.  A more detailed description of the
   processing is found in Section 7 for obtaining the security policies
   that can be applied to a messages and Section 8 for sending a

   message.

   1.  The Sending Agent sends a message to one or more Email Policy
       Services in order to obtain the set of policies that it can apply
       to a message along with a security token to be used in proving
       the authorization.  Details of the message send can be found in
       Section 7.1.

   2.  The Email Policy Service examines the set of policies that it
       understands and checks to see if the requester is authorized to
       send messages with the policy.

   3.  The Email Policy Service returns the set of policies and an
       security token to the Sending Agent.  Details of the message sent
       can be found in Section 7.2.

   4.  The Sending Agent selects the Email Policy(s) to be applied to
       the message, along with the set of recipients for the message.

   5.  The Sending Agent relays the selected information to the Email
       Policy Service along with the security token.  Details of this
       message can be found in Section 8.1.

   6.  The Email Policy Service creates the recipient info attribute as
       defined in [EPS-CMS].

   7.  The Email Policy Service returns the created attribute to the
       Sending Agent.  Details of this message can be found in
       Section 8.2.

   8.  The Sending Agent composes the CMS EnvelopedData content type
       placing the returned attribute into a KEKRecipientInfo structure
       and then send the message to the Mail Transport Agent.

3.2.  Recieving Agent Processing

   We layout the general steps that need to be taken by the sender of an
   EPS message.  The numbers in the steps below refer to the numbers in
   the lower half of Figure 1.  A more detailed description of the
   processing is found in Section 9.

   1.  The Receiving Agent obtains the message from the Mail Transport
       Agent.

   2.  The Receiving Agent starts to decode the message and in that
       process locates an EvelopedData content type which has a
       KEKRecipientInfo structure with a XXXX attribute.

   3.  The Receiving Agent processes the SignedData content of the XXXX
       attribute to determine that communicating with it falls within
       accepted policy.

   4.  The Receiving Agent transmits the content of the XXXX attribute
       to the referenced Email Policy Service.  The details of this
       message can be found in Section 9.1.

   5.  The Email Policy Service decrypts the content of the message and
       applies the policy to the credentials provided by the Receiving
       Agent.

   6.  If the policy passes, the Email Policy Service returns the
       appropriate key or RecipientInfo structure to the Receiving
       Agent.  Details of this message can be found in Section 9.2.

   7.  The Receiving Agent proceeds to decrypt the message and perform
       normal processing.

4.  Plasma Request

   There is a single top level structure that is used by a client to
   send a request to the server.

   The XML Schema used to describe the top level request is as follows:

     <xs:element name="PlasmaRequest" type="RequestType"/>
     <xs:complexType name="RequestType">
       <xs:sequence>
         <xs:element ref="Authentication" minOccurs="0"/>
         <xs:element ref="xacml:Request" minOccurs="0"/>
       </xs:sequence>
     </xs:complexType>

   A Plasma Request will have two elements in it:

   Authentication  is an optional element that contains the various
      methods of authentication that are available for use.

   xacml:Request  is an optional element that contains the control
      information for a what is happening.  This element is taken from
      the XACML specification.

4.1.  Authentication Element

   The authentication type is used to carry information about the
   different ways that the Plasma server will allow for authentication
   to occur.  More than one authentication field can be filled in when
   sending message to the server.  If more than one authentication field
   is set, then the server can select which fields are to be used.  More
   than one field can be used.

   The fields of this element are:

   SAML_Collection  holds a sequence of one or more SAML assertions.
      These assertions can contain statements about attributes or keys
      for the requester.

   GSS_API  holds a GSS-API message object.  This message object will
      normally be using the GSS-API/EAP method defined by [ABFAB].

   WS_Token  holds a WS-Token obtained from some source.  The most
      common source for a WS-Token to be obtained from will be from a
      previous conversation with a Plasma server.  For example, one or
      more WS-Tokens will be returned from a Get Roles dialog.

4.2.  xacml:Request Element

   We use the xacml:Request element for creating the access control
   request of the Plasma Server.  When the request element is present,
   one will normally have an attribute from the
   urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category.  This document
   defines a set of actions to be used with the server.

   Additional attributes can be added to the request as well.  These
   attributes can help control what is happening to the message and
   provide additional data to the request.  When attributes are to be
   provided in an authenticated manner, then they must be provided in a
   different manner than being placed here.  Unless self-assertion is
   considered sufficient.

   For convenience the schema for the xacml:Request element is
   reproduced here:

<xs:element name="Request" type="xacml:RequestType"/>
<xs:complexType name="RequestType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:RequestDefaults" minOccurs="0"/>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:Attributes" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:MultiRequests" minOccurs="0"/>
  </xs:sequence>
  <xs:attribute name="ReturnPolicyIdList" type="xs:boolean" use="required"/>
  <xs:attribute name="CombinedDecision" type="xs:boolean" use="required"/>
</xs:complexType>

   The use of the RequestDefaults and MultiRequest elements is possible,
   but will generally not be supported.

5.  Plasma Response Element

   There is a single top level structure that is used by the server to
   respond to a client request.

   The XML Schema used to describe the top level response is as follows:

  <xs:element name="PlasmaResponse" type="ResponseType"/>
  <xs:complexType name="ResponseType">
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element ref="xacml:Response"/>
      <xs:element name="PlasmaTokens" minOccurs="0">
        <xs:complexType>
          <xs:sequence>
            <xs:element ref="PlasmaToken" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          </xs:sequence>
        </xs:complexType>
      </xs:element>
      <xs:element name="CMSToken" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
        <xs:complexType>
          <xs:simpleContent>
            <xs:extension base="xs:hexBinary">
              <xs:attribute name="TokenId" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
            </xs:extension>
          </xs:simpleContent>
        </xs:complexType>
      </xs:element>
      <xs:element ref="CMSKey" minOccurs="0"/>
      <xs:element ref="Authentication" minOccurs="0"/>
    </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>

   A Plasma Response has three elements used:

   xacml:Response  is a mandatory element that returns the status of the
      access request.

   PlasmaTokens  is an optional element that will return one or more
      PlasmaToken elements.

   CMSToken  is an optional element that contains the CMS Token that is
      included in a CMS message as part of a recipient info element.

   CMSKey  is an optional element that contains the key to be used in
      decrypting a CMS message.

   Authentication  return a GSS-API element as part of a GSS-API
      authentication process.  Also return a challenge.  A full
      discussion of the Authentication element can be found in
      Section 6.

5.1.  xacml:Response Element

   The xacml:Response element has the ability to return both a decision,
   but additionally information about why a decision was not made.

   The schema for the xacml:Response element is reproduced here for
   convenience:

<xs:element name="Response" type="xacml:ResponseType"/>
<xs:complexType name="ResponseType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:Result" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

<xs:element name="Result" type="xacml:ResultType"/>
<xs:complexType name="ResultType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:Decision"/>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:Status" minOccurs="0"/>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:Obligations" minOccurs="0"/>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:AssociatedAdvice" minOccurs="0"/>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:Attributes" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
    <xs:element ref="xacml:PolicyIdentifierList" minOccurs="0"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

   The xacml:Response element consists of one child the Result.  While
   the schema allows for multiple results to be returned, it is
   constrained to be a single Result returned in this specification as
   only a single request will ever be made at one time.

   The xacml:Response element consists of the following elements:

   xacml:Decision  is a mandatory element that returns the possible
      decisions of the access control decision.  The set of permitted
      values are Permit, Deny, Indeterminate and No Policy.

   xacml:Status  is an optional element returned for the Indeterminate
      status which provides for the reason that a decision was not able
      to be reached.  Additionally it can contain hints for remedying
      the situation.  This document defines a new set of status values
      to be returned.  Formal declaration may be found in Section 11.

      *  gss-api indicates that a gss-api message has been returned as
         part of the authentication process.

   xacml:Obligations  is designed to force the PEP to perform specific
      actions prior to allowing access to the resource.  This element is
      not used by Plasma and SHOULD be absent.  If a response is
      returned with this element present, the processing MUST fail
      unless the PEP can perform the required action.[anchor15]

   xacml:AssocatedAdvice  is designed to give suggestions to the PEP
      about performing specific actions prior to allowing access to the
      resource.  This element is not used by Plasma and SHOULD be
      absent.  If the response is returned with this element present,
      processing will succeed even if the PEP does not know how to
      perform the required action.

   xacml:Attributes  provides a location for the server to return
      attributes used in the access control evaluation process.  Only
      those attributes requested in the Attributes section of the
      request are to be returned.  Since Plasma does not generally
      supply attributes for the evaluation process, this field will
      normally be absent.

   xacml:PolicyIdentifierList  provides a location to return the set of
      policies used to grant access to the resource.  This element is
      expected to be absent for Plasma.

6.  Authentication Element

   One of the core issues that the Plasma specification needs to address
   is how the client is authenticated to the server.  This is important
   because many of the use cases envisioned are not the simple ones
   where Plasma server is going to know the authentication credentials
   for the client, but rather will need to get the authentication from a
   third part in some way.  The authentication element therefore is
   somewhat complicated as it needs to allow for a variety of different
   authentication methods.

   The schema for the Authentication element is:

     <xs:element name="Authentication" type="AuthenticationType"/>
     <xs:complexType name="AuthenticationType">
       <xs:sequence>
         <xs:element name="SAML_Collection" minOccurs="0">
           <xs:complexType>
             <xs:sequence>
               <xs:element ref="saml:Assertion" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
             </xs:sequence>
           </xs:complexType>
         </xs:element>
         <xs:element name="GSS_API" type="xs:hexBinary" minOccurs="0"/>
         <xs:element name="WS_Token" type="xs:hexBinary" minOccurs="0"/>
         <xs:element ref="ds:Signature" minOccurs="0"/>
       </xs:sequence>
     </xs:complexType>

   More than one authentication element may be present in any single
   message.  This is because a client may need to provide more than one
   piece of data to a server in order to authenticate, for example a
   holder of key SAML Assertion along with a signature created with that
   key.  Additionally a client may want to provide the server an option
   of different ways of doing the authentication.  In a federated
   scenario, an X.509 certificate with a signature can be presented and
   the server may not be able to build a trust path to it's set of trust
   anchors.  In this case the server may opt to use the GSS-API/EAP
   protocol for doing the authentication.  Finally, the client may want
   to provide the server with a SAML Assertion that binds a number of
   attributes to it's identities so that the server does not need to ask
   for those attributes at a later time.

6.1.  WS Trust Tokens

   WS Trust tokens are used in two different ways by this specification.
   They can be used as the primary introduction method of a client to
   the server, or they can be used by the server to allow the client to



Schaad                    Expires July 13, 2012                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                  EPS TRUST                   January 2012


   be re-introduced to the server in such a way that the server can use
   cached information.

   WS Trust tokens come in two basic flavors: Bearer tokens and Holder
   of Key tokens.  With the first flavor, presentation of the token is
   considered to be sufficient to allow the server to validate the
   identity of the presenter and know the appropriate attributes to make
   a policy decision.  In the second flavor some type of cryptographic
   operation is needed in addition to just presenting the token.  The
   Signature element Section 6.2 provides necessary infrastructure to
   permit the cryptographic result to be passed to the server.

   This document does not define the content or structure of any tokens
   to be used.  This is strictly an implementation issue for the servers
   in question.  This is because the client can treat the WS Token value
   presented to it as an opaque blob.  Only the servers need to
   understand how to process the blob.  However there are some
   additional fields which can be returned in addition to the token that
   need to be discussed:

   wst:TokenType  SHOULD be returned if more than one type of token is
      used by the set of servers.  If a token type is returned to the
      client, the client MUST include the element when the token is
      returned to the server.

   wst:BinarySecret  SHOULD be returned for moderate duration tokens.
      If a binary secret is returned then the client MUST provide
      protection for the secret value.  When a binary secret has been
      returned, then the client MUST create either a signature or MAC
      value and place it into the Signature element Section 6.2.
      [anchor17].

   wst:Lifetime  MUST be returned with the wsu:Expires element set.  The
      wsu:Created element MAY be included.  The element provides the
      client a way to know when a token is going to expire and obtain a
      new one as needed.

6.2.  XML Signature Element

   The XML signature standard [XML-Signature] is used to provide for
   holder of key assertions and binary secrets to be used to create
   proofs that the respective secrets are held by the client.  When
   creating either a signature or a MAC, the following statements hold:

   o  The canonicalization algorithm Canonical XML 1.1 [XML-C14N11]
      without comments will be used in preparing the XML node set for
      hashing.

Internet-Draft                  EPS TRUST                   January 2012


   o  The Signature element SHOULD include an Enveloped Signature
      Transformation (Section 6.6.4 of [XML-Signature] but MAY be the
      root of the Plasm request.  Both methods MUST be supported by
      Plasma servers.

   o  The signature algorithm RSAwithSHA256 MUST be supported by both
      clients and servers.  The MAC algorithm HMAC-SHA256 MUST be
      supported by both clients and servers.

6.3.  SAML Collection Element

   The SAML collection element provides a holder to place one or more
   SAML Assertions.  Three types of SAML assertions may be place in this
   location: Bearer assertions, Holder of Key assertions and Attribute
   assertions.  The first two types are used for the purposes of
   authenticating the client to the server.  The last type is used to
   carry a binding of attributes and identity.  The first two types may
   also carry attributes other than just an identity statement.

6.4.  GSS-API Element

   TBD - rules for using GSS-API in general and the EAP version from
   ABFAB particularly.

   o  How to build the name.

   o  Must use a secure tunnel for the outer EAP method and an
      appropriate inner EAP method(s) to accomplish the required level
      of authentication.

   o  Server query of attributes and specification of LOA to the EAP
      IdP.

   o  Any additional Trust model items.

   o  How round trips are accomplished - the only case that a server
      will send back an Authentication element is on return processing
      of GSS-API messages.

7.  Role Token and Policy Acquisition

   In order to send a message using a Plasma server, the first step is
   to obtain a role token that provides the description of the lables
   that can be applied and the authorization to send a message using one
   or more of the labels.  The process of obtaining the role token is
   designed to be a query/response round trip to the Plasma server.  In
   practice a number of round trips may be necessary in order to provide
   all of the identity and attributes to the Plasma server that are
   needed to evaluate the policies for the labels.  An example of a
   request token can be found in Appendix B.

   When a Plasma server receives a role token request from a client, it
   needs to perform a policy evaluation for all of the policies that it
   arbitrates along with all of the options for those policies.  In
   general, the first time that a client requests a role token from the
   server, it will not know the level of authentication that is needed
   or the set of attributes that needs to be presented in order to get
   the set of tokens.  A server MUST NOT issue a role token without
   first attempting to retrieve from an attribute source (either the
   client or a back end server) all of the attributes required to check
   all policies.  Since the work load required on the server is expected
   to be potentially extensive for creating the role token, it is
   expected that the token returned will be valid for a period of time.
   This will allow for the frequency of the operation to be reduced.
   While the use of an extant role token can be used for identity proof,
   it is not generally suggested that a new token be issued without
   doing a full evaluation of the attributes of the client as either the
   policy or the set of client attributes may have changed in the mean
   time.

7.1.  Role Token Request

   The process starts by a client sending a server a role token request.
   Generally, but not always, the request will include some type of
   identity proof information and a set of generic attributes.  It is
   suggested that, after the first successful conversation, the client
   cache hints about the identity and attributes needed for a server.
   This allows for fewer round trips in later conversations.

   The role token request, as with all requests, is always built using
   the eps:PlasmaRequest XML structure.  The xacml:Request element MUST
   be included on the first message, but is omitted on subsequent
   authentication round trips.  The eps:Authentication MAY be included
   on the first message (depending on how authentication is going to be
   done) and MUST be included on subsequent authentication round trips.

   When sending the role token there are a number of things that can be

Internet-Draft                  EPS TRUST                   January 2012


   done.  These include:

   o  The client can optionally include an attribute to specify the name
      to be used for policy evaluation purposes.  If this attribute is
      absent, then the name is extracted from the identity proof
      provided externally.  This attribute allows for a client to get
      delegated permissions for a third party.  One case where this
      would be used is for an executive assistant to be able to act as
      the executive for reading certain types of messages.  When this
      behavior is desired, the following attribute is used:

      Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject-category:access-
      subject"
      AttributeId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:data-type:rfc822Name"

      Plasma servers MUST implement the rfc822Name attribute id, other
      name forms MAY be implemented as well.

   o  The client MUST include an action attribute.  This document
      defines the action attribute to be used for requesting role
      tokens:

      Category="urn:oasis:name:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action"
      AttributeId="urn:ietf:plasma:action-id"
      Attribute Value: GetRoleTokens

   o  The client can optionally include a SAML assertion in the
      Authentication section of the message.  See section Section 6.3
      for more information on how to deal with SAML assertions carrying
      attribute statements.

   An example of a message requesting the set of policy information is:

   <esp:PlasmaRequest>
     <eps:Authentication>...</eps:Authentication>
     <xacml:Request>
       <xacml:Attributes Category="...:action">
         <xacml:Attribute AttributeId="urn:plasma:action-id">
           <xacml:AttributeValue
              DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
             GetRoleToken</xacml:AttributeValue>
         </xacml:Attribute>
       </xacml:Attributes>
     </xacml:Request>
   </esp:PlasmaRequest>

   In this example the identity information of the requester is implicit
   from the transport protocol used.

7.2.  Request Role Token Response

   In response to a role token request message, the Plasma server
   returns a role token request message.  The response message uses the
   eps:PlasmaResponse XML structure.  When a response message is create
   the following should be noted:

   o  An xacml:Decision is always included in a response message.  The
      values permitted are:

      Permit  is used to signal success.  In this case the response
         message MUST include an eps:PlasmaTokens element.

      Deny  is used to signal failure.  In this case the xacml:Status
         element MUST be present an contain a failure reason.

      Indeterminate  is used to signal that a result cannot yet be
         reached.  In this case there must be a request for additional
         attributes in the xacml:Result/Attributes element or additional
         authentication information to be carried in TBD.

      NotApplicable  is returned if the Plasma server does not have the
         capability to issue role tokens.

   An example of a message returning the set of policy information is:

  <eps:PlasmaResponse>
    <xacml:Response>
      <xacml:Result>
        <xacml:Decision>Permit</xacml:Decision>
      </xacml:Result>
    </xacml:Response>
    <eps:PlasmaTokens>
      <eps:PlasmaToken>
        <eps:PolicyList>

            Details of a policy
          </eps:Policy>
          ... More policies ...
          <wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse>
            <wst:TokenType>urn:...:plasma:roleToken</wst:TokenType>
            <wst:RequestedSecurityToken>...</wst:RequestedSecurityToken>
          </wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse>
        </eps:PolicyList>
      </eps:PlasmaToken>

   In this example, the Email Policy Service is returning three
   different policies that can be used along with a security token and a
   key to be used with the token when sending a message.

7.2.1.  PlasmaTokens XML element

   The eps:PlasmaTokens element is used to return one or more tokens to
   the client.  Each token returned will contain one or more policies
   that can be asserted with the token and the token itself.
   Additionally the name of a Plasma server to be used with the token
   can be included as well as cryptographic information to be used with
   the token.

   The schema used for the PlasmaTokens element is:

  <xs:element name="PlasmaToken" type="PlasmaTokenType"/>
  <xs:complexType name="PlasmaTokenType">
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element name="PDP" type="xs:anyURI" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>

   The eps:PlasmaTokens field will contain one or more eps:PlasmaToken
   elements.

   The eps:PlasmaToken element contains the following items:

   PDP  is an optional element.  If the element is present, it provides
      one or more URLs to be used for containing a Plasma server for the
      purpose of sending a message.  This element allows for the use of
      different Plasma servers for issuing role tokens and message
      tokens.  No ranking of the servers is implied by the order of the
      URLs returned.

   PolicyList  contains the description of one or more policies that can
      be asserted using the issued token.  Any of the policies contained
      in the list may be combined together using the policy logic in
      constructing a label during the send message process.

   Label  contains a single specific label.  This element is returned as
      part of a read message token to allow for replies to be formulated
      by an entity that cannot generally originate a message using the
      policy.

   wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse  contains the actual token itself.

   The eps:PolicyType type is used to represent the elements of a policy
   to the client.  The elements in this type are:

   Name  contains a display string that represents the policy.  This
      element is localized in response to the TBD attribute in the TBD
      field.

   Identifier  contains a "unique" identifier for the policy.  This is
      the value that identifies the policy to the software.  The type
      for the value is defined as a string and is expected to be either
      a URN, and Object Identifier or some equally unique identifier.

   Options  allows for a set of options to be specified for the policy.
      The set of options is dependent on the policy and only those
      clients which have pre-knowledge of a policy are expected to be
      able to deal with them.  The options can range from a simple
      yes/no selection to a list of strings.  An example of using
      options is provided by the basic policies defined in [TBD] where a
      set of RFC 822 names is provided.[anchor20]

   When building the wst:RequestSecurityTokenResponse element, the
   following should be noted:

      A wst:RequestedSecruityToken element containing the security token
      MUST be included.  The format of the security token is not
      specified and is implementation specific, it is not expected that
      .  Examples of items that could be used as security tokens are
      SAML statements, encrypted record numbers in a server database.

      A wst:Lifetime giving the life time of the token SHOULD be
      included.  It is not expected that this should be determinable
      from the token itself and thus must be independently provided.
      There is no guarantee that the token will be good during the
      lifetime as it make get revoked due to changes in credentials,
      however the client is permitted to act as if it were.  The token
      provided may be used for duration.  If this element is absent, it
      should be assumed that the token is either a one time token or of
      limited duration.

8.  Sending A Message

   After having obtained a role token from a Plasma server, the client
   can then prepare to send a message by requesting a message token from
   the Plasma server.  As part of the preparatory process, the client
   will construct the label to be applied to the message from the set of
   policies that it can assert, determine the optional elements for
   those policies which have options, generate the random key encryption
   key and possible create the key recipient structures for the message.
   Although this section is written in terms of a CMS Encrypted message,
   there is nothing to prevent the specification of different formats
   and still use this same basic protocol.  An example of a request
   token exchange can be found in Appendix D.

8.1.  Send Message Request

   The send message request is built using the eps:PlasmaRequest XML
   structure.  When building the request, the following aplies:

   o  The eps:Authentication element MAY be included in the initial
      message.  The authorization is supplied by the role token which is
      included in the data structure, however authentication may be
      required as well.  The authentication data is placed here.

   o  The xacml:Request element MUST be included in the initial message.

   o  The client MUST include an action attribute.  This document
      defines the action attribute to be used for purpose:

      Category = "urn:oasis:name:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action"
      AttributeId="urn:ietf:plasma:action-id"
      Attribute Value= GetSendCMSToken

   o  The client MUST include a data attribute.  This attribute contains
      the information that is used to build the CMS Message token to be
      returned.  There MAY be more than one data attribute, but this
      will not be a normal case.  More details on this attribute are in
      Section 8.1.1.

   An example of a message returning the set of policy information is:

8.1.1.  CMS Message Token Data Structure

   The message token data structure is used as an attribute to carry the
   necessary information to issue a CMS message token.  The schema that

   AttributeId = "urn:ietf:plasma:data-id"
   DataType = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyType"

   The elements of the structure are used as:

   RoleToken  contains the previously issued role token which provides
      the authorization to use the policies in the label.

   Label  contains the label to be applied to the message.

   Recipients  is an optional element that contains one or more
      recipient info structures.

   KEK  is an optional element that contains the KEK to decrypt the CMS
      lock box.

   One or both of KEK and Recipients MUST be present.

   The elements of the RecipientInfoType structure are:

Internet-Draft                  EPS TRUST                   January 2012


   Subject  contains a subject identifier.  Since a CMS recipient info
      structure does not contain a great deal of information about the
      recipient, this element contains a string which can be used to
      identify the subject.  This will normally be an RFC 822 name.
      Multiple subject names can be provided for a single lock box.
      This allows for the use a KEK value that is shared among the set
      of recipients but not the Plasma server.

   LockBox  contains a hex encoded CMS Recipient Info structure.  If the
      recipient info structure is placed here, it MUST NOT be placed in
      the CMS EnvelopedData structure as well.

8.2.  Send Message Response

   In response to a send message request, the Plasma server returns a
   send message response message.  The response messages uses the eps:
   PlasmaResponse XML structure.  When the response message is created,
   the following should be noted:

   o  The xacml:Decisions is always included in the response.  If the
      'Permit' value is returned then the eps:CMSToken element MUST be
      present.

   o  The eps:CMSToken element is included in a success message.  It
      contains value of the keyatt-eps-kek attribute defined in
      [EPS-CMS].

   An example of a message returning the set of policy information is:

   <eps:PlasmaResponse>
     <xacml:Response>
       <xacml:Result>
         <xacml:Decision>Permit</xacml:Decision>

9.  Decoding A Message

   When the receiving agent is ready to decrypt the message, it
   identifies that there is a KEKRecipientInfo object which contains a
   key attribute identified by id-keyatt-eps-token.  It validates that
   communicating with the Email Policy Service is within local policy
   and then sends a request to the service to obtain the encryption key
   for the message.

   In some cases the recipient of a message is not authorized to use the
   same set of labels for sending a message.  For this purpose a token
   can be returned in the message along with the key so that recipient
   of the can reply to the message using the same set of security
   labels.

9.1.  Requesting Message Key

   The client sends a request to the Plasma server that is identified in
   the token.  For the CMS base tokens, the address of the Plasma server
   to use is defined in [EPS-CMS] this is located in the aa-eps-url
   attribute.

   The request uses the eps:PlasmaRequest XML structure.  When building
   the request, the following should be noted:

   o  The xacml:Request MUST be present in the first message of the
      exchange.

   o  The action used to denote that a CMS token should be decrypted is:

      Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xaml:3.0:attribute-category:action"
      AttributeId="urn:ietf:plasma:action-id"
      Attribute Value: ParseCMSToken

   o  The CMS token to be cracked is identified by:[anchor21]

      Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-cateogry:data"
      AttributeId="urn:ietf:plasma:data-id"
      Attribute Value: CMSToken

   o  In the event that a reply to role token is wanted as well, then
      that is supplied as a separate action:

      Category="urn:oasis:names:tc:xaml:3.0:attribute-category:action"
      AttributeId="urn:ietf:plasma:action-id"
      Attribute Value: GetReplyToken

9.2.  Requesting Message Key Response

   In response to a message key request, the Plasma server returns a
   decrypted key.  The response message uses the eps:Plasma XML
   structure.  When a response message is create the following should be
   noted:

   o  If the value of xacml:Decision is Permit, then response MUST
      include an eps:CMSKey element.

   o  If a reply token was requested and granted, then the response MUST
      include an eps:PlasmaToken element.  The eps:PlasmaToken element
      MUST use the Label option

   An example of a message returning the set of policy information is:

   <eps:PlasmaResponse>
     <xacml:Response>
       <xacml:Result>
         <xacml:Decision>Permit</xacml:Decision>

Editorial Comments

   [anchor7]   Brian: Should one be able to create a policy on the fly
               for specific item where a set of attributes can be
               defined by the sender of the message.

   [anchor15]  jls: My initial thought was that we would not defined any
               obligations or advice, but I am no longer sure that is
               true.  Things like specifiying a mandatory encryption
               algorithm or time limit on keeping the decrypted KEK
               value would be reasonable to be placed here and give a
               standard way for the policy to communicate that to the
               client.

   [anchor17]  JLS: I don't know of any way to say use the asymmetric
               key that you authenticated with originally - can this be
               done?

   [anchor20]  JLS: I keep wondering if we need to define a set of
               minimal structures that can be used for options so that
               the entirety is not pushed off onto the client and server
               to parse and understand the structures.

   [anchor21]  jls: I need to think this case out a bit more - I want to
               be able to supply multiple CMS tokens at one time,
               however I am not sure if that is do able because if you
               get a success for one token and a deny for another token
               there is no way to handle that in the xacml:Response.

Appendix D.  Example: Get CMS Token Request

   This section contains an example of a request from a client to a
   server for a CMS message token to be issued.  The authentication for
   the request is provided by using a WS-Trust token previously issued
   as part of a role request/response dialog.  The request contains the
   following elements:

   o  A complex rule set is requested where permission to is to be
      granted to anyone who meets either of the two policies given.

   o  A specific recipient info structure is provided for a subject
      who's name is 'lisa@simpsons.com'.  The details of the recipient
      info structure are skipped but it would be any encoding of a
      RecipientInfo structure from CMS.

   o  A generic key encryption key is provided for any other subject who
      meets the policies specified.
