   Interoperability Problems of StateLess Address Auto-Configuration
          (SLAAC) Arising from Duplicate Link-layer Addresses
          draft-gont-v6ops-slaac-issues-with-duplicate-macs-00

Abstract

   Traditional Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC) typically
   involves producing a Modified-EU64 format identifier to be employed
   as the Interface-ID of the resulting address.  In the case of
   Ethernet network interface cards, such identifier derived from the
   corresponding IEEE 802 address.  IEEE 802 addresses are generally
   expected to be globally unique, thus resulting in non-duplicate
   addresses.  However, in many real-world scenarios, these identifiers
   fail to be unique, thus resulting in duplicate IPv6 addresses.  This
   document discusses the interoperability problems arising from
   duplicate IEEE 802 addresses with IPv6 Stateless Address Auto-
   Configuration (SLAAC), and how some popular implementations react
   when the such problems arise.  Finally, it discusses possible
   mitigations for the aforementioned issue.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] for
   Ethernet network interface cards typically involves generating a
   Modified EUI64 format identifier derived from the IEEE 802 address of
   the underlying in network interface card.  Such Modified EUI-64
   format identifier is then employed as the Interface-ID part of the
   resulting IPv6 address.  Since the IEEE 802 addresses are generally
   expected to be globally-unique, the aforementioned algorithm is
   expected to result in unique addresses.

   In any case, in order to prevent two systems from configuring the
   same address on the same network segment, [RFC4862] specifies a
   mechanism called "Duplicate Address Detection" (DAD), which employs
   Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages to detect
   whether a candidate IPv6 address is already in use on the local
   network.  DAD is meant only to *detect* an address conflict: it is up
   to the implementation what to do if/once such a conflict is detected
   -- and the current SLAAC specification [RFC4862] essentially leaves
   possible algorithms to resolve the aforementioned DAD failure
   unspecified.

   In practice, virtually all implementation do not employ any algorithm
   for resolving duplicate address conflicts, and therefore such event
   leads to a failure of IPv6 stateless address configuration.

   Section 2 discusses the occurrence of duplicate IEEE 802 addresses in
   some detail.  Section 3 analyzes the pros and cons of generating
   Modified EUI-64 format identifiers by essentially embedding a IEEE
   802 address in the aforementioned identifier.  Section 4 provides
   some details regarding how different implementations behave in the
   presence of DAD failures.  Finally, Section 5 discusses possible
   mitigations for the aforementioned issue.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Duplicate IEEE 802 addresses in the real world

   IEEE 802 addresses are, in principle, not necessarily unique: the U/L
   bit the in the IEEE Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) implies,
   when clear, a globally-unique IEEE 802 address, but indicates a non-
   unique ("local") address when set.  However, most products ship with
   IEEE 802 addresses that have the U/L bit set, thus implying globally-
   unique IEEE 802 addresses.

   However, in practice, even if when the U/L bit is clear, the
   corresponding IEEE 802 address might be non-unique.  There are a
   number of reasons for which duplicate IEEE 802 addresses might exist
   in a given network:

   o  Some vendors have been found to simply "reuse" IEEE 802 addreses

   o  Virtualization technologies, such as VirtualBox, essentially
      select IEEE 802 addresses randomly, from a specific IEEE OUI
      [VirtualBox].  This means that it is possible for two virtual
      machines to end up employing the same IEEE 802 address for their
      respective virtual interfaces.

   Besides any assessment of whether duplicate IEEE 802 addresses are
   the product of poor engineering choices or not, truth is that
   deployed systems might already be employing duplicate addresses, and
   hence it is desirable that such scenarios are gracefully handled.

3.  IEEE-derived Modified EUI-64 format identifiers

   One might argue that the only motivation for producing Modified
   EUI-64 format identifiers as specified in [RFC2464] are:

   o  In theory, it is a simple algorithm to produce globally-unique
      Modified EUI-64 format identifiers.

   o  Until recently, it was the only algorithm to produce stable
      Interface-IDs that had so far been standardized.

         The privacy extensions specified in [RFC4941] are meant to be
         employed *in addition* to traditional SLAAC addresses, while
         [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] is a recent
         standardization effort.

   Given that IEEE 802 addresses have been found to fail the uniqueness
   criteria assumed above, IEEE-derived Modified EUI-64 format
   identifiers will also fail the same uniqueness criteria.
   Additionally, IEEE-derived identifiers have been found to result in
   addresses that are trivial to scan
   [I-D.gont-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning], and that negatively affect the
   privacy of users [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] [RFC4941].
   While it is true producing modified EUI64 format identifiers is the
   only scheme that has so far been fully standardized, there is ongoing
   work at the 6man wg to standardize an alternative scheme for
   producing stable modified EUI-64 format identifiers, which does not
   suffer from any of the drawbacks of modified EUI-64 format
   identifiers based on IEEE-identifiers.

   At lest discussions in IETF circles seem to indicate that the
   drawbacks of modified EUI-64 format identifiers based on IEEE-
   identifiers are well-understood, and that there seems to be agreement
   that "they should be replaced with some alternative scheme".

4.  Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) implementations

   Different IPv6 stacks differ in some DAD implementations details,
   and, most importantly, on how they handle DAD failures.  For example,
   different IPv6 stacks may send a different number of DAD probes
   before DAD is considered to have succeeded.  Additionally, they
   typically differ on how they handle DAD failures.  For example, in
   the Linux IPv6 stack, if DAD fails for a link-local address, it
   results in a "permanent" SLAAC failure that requires the admin to
   reboot the system in order for SLAAC to be re-attempted.  On the
   other hand, DAD failure for non-link-local addresses is more of a
   "soft failure", and hence SLAAC might succeed some time later when a
   new Router Advertisement message that triggers SLAAC is received.

5.  Mitigations to the problem of SLAAC failures due to duplicate IEEE
    802 addresses

5.1.  Implementing some DAD-failure recovery algorithm

   One simple algorithm to resolve DAD failures could be such that, in
   the event of such failures, simply generates a new IPv6 tentative
   address by incrementing the Interface-ID of the tentative IPv6
   address that previously failed DAD.

5.2.  Replacing Modified EUI-64 format identifiers based on IEEE 802
      addresses

   A different approach to solve the problems arising from DAD failures
   would be to realize that there are a number of factors that make
   modified EUI64 format identifiers based on IEEE 802 addresses
   undesirable, and hence recommend the implementation of
   [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] in replacement of the IEEE-
   derived modified EUI-64 format identifiers.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses an interoperability problem that may arise as
   a result of employing duplicate IEEE 802 addresses in the same
   network segment.  Failure to gracefully handle DAD failures may allow
   an attacker to perform a Denial of Service attack against the victim
   implementation.

      Such attacks could be readily performed with packet-crafting tools
      such as [SI6-Toolkit] and [THC-IPv6].

   A more resilient approach might be to perform DAD for some maximum
   number of tentative IPv6 addresses, and to not perform DAD at all for
   the last of those address.

      Obviously, this might lead to undesirable results if such "last"
      address was a real duplicate of an address currently in use at the
      local network.

   In any case, as noted earlier in this document, IEEE-derived modified
   EUI64 format identifiers have undesirable properties in the areas of
   host tracking and host privacy, and hence the interoperability
   problem discussed in this document could be considered as yet another
   reason to replace such identifiers with some alternative scheme, such
   as that specified in [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses]
