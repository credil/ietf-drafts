                 p2mp pw protection for MPLS-TP network
              draft-liu-pwe3-mpls-tp-p2mp-pw-protection-03

Abstract

   The requirements of MPLS-TP in RFC 5654 include a requirement(R63)
   that requires MPLS-TP MUST be possible to provide protection for
   MPLS-TP data plane without any IP forwarding capability and control
   plane.If applying 1:1 protection mechanism for the p2mp traffic in
   rfc6718 , it must have a return path to coordinate switch state to
   select the same path to receive and send traffic packet.For the above
   problem,this document describes a kind of protection solution to
   recovery and protect the p2mp traffic under the failure condition.




   This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) /
   International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
   defined by the ITU-T.

1.  Problem statement

   According to MPLS-TP requirement(RFC 5654), It requires that MPLS-TP
   data plane is independent of control plane and IP forwarding
   capability.  So it means that MPLS-TP data plane can still work
   without control plane and any IP forwarding capability.It must be
   essential for unidiretional path including p2p or p2mp path to set up
   a return path between any two end nodes . So it costs more
   configuration and maintenece . While this document provides a
   protection mechanism for p2mp traffic without return path, IP
   forwarding capability and control plane.

3.  Protection Mechanism

   This section will describe a protection mechanism for p2mp pw
   path,which regards a leaf node as protector node of another leaf node
   on the p2mp pw path.The two leaf nodes protect each other.in addtion,
   In order to be easy to access to CE node, It should select LER as
   backup node which will connect protector node and CE node.  If the
   backup node is still a leaf node of the p2mp pw path ,in a result,
   the protector node and the backup node are the same node. in addtion,
   A bidirectional p2p pw should be configurated between the protected
   node and the backup node or the protector node , and between the
   protector node and the backup node .Just as the following figure 1:

        Figure 1: p2mp pw protection configuration topology figure

   LER0 is root node of a p2mp pw, LER1 and LER3 are leaf nodes of the
   p2mp pw.  LER2 is a backup node for LER1 and LER3.  When the
   protected node LER1 or LER3 has a failure, its backup node LER2 will
   replace of the protected node LER1 or LER3 to transmit the protected
   p2mp traffic to CE1 or CE2.

   If LER1 has a failure, LER2 MUST detect the failure by PW OAM.  Then
   LER2 will notify its protector node LER3 of the failure by pw status
   message[1].  When LER3 receives the failure status message, it will
   begin to duplicate the p2mp traffic to send to LER2 by pre-configured
   p2p protection pw.  Then LER2 sends the p2mp traffic to CE1 by its
   access link(LER2-CE1) ,Just as the following figure 2.

                          Figure 2: node failure

   When a leaf node detects a failure on its working pw , it will notify
   the failure of its backup node or protector node by pw status
   message[1].  So its backup node or protector node will transmit the
   protected p2mp traffic to the protected node.Just as the following
   figure 3.

   When a failure happens on the branch working pw path(LER0-LSRA-LER1),
   the protected node LER1 will detect the failure and inform the
   failure of its backup node LER2 and protector node LER3.  Then LER2
   and LER3 receive the failure message from LER1 ,LER3 will duplicate
   the protected p2mp traffic to send to the backup node LER2 firstly by
   its protection pw between LER2 and LER3.  Then LER2 sends the traffic
   to the protected node LER1 by the protection pw between LER1 and
   LER2.  At last CE1 will receive the traffic by its access
   link(LER1-CE1)
