PCE-Initiated Traffic Engineering Path Setup in Segment Routed Networks
               draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing-00.txt

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) enables any head-end node to select any path
   without relying on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g., LDP or
   RSVP-TE).  It depends only on "segments" that are advertised by Link-
   State Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs).  A Segment Routed Path can
   be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest
   Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a stateful Path
   Computation Element (PCE).  This document specifies extensions to the
   Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to
   signal and instantiate Traffic Engineering paths in SR networks.

1.  Introduction

   In SR networks, a chosen without relying on hop-by-hop signaling
   protocols such as LDP or RSVP-TE.  Each path is specified as a set of
   "segments" advertised by link-state routing protocols (IS-IS or
   OSPF).  [SR-ARCH] provides an introduction to SR technology.  The
   corresponding IS-IS extension and OSPF extension are specified
   repectively in [SR-ISIS] and a document to be published soon.  Two
   types of segments have been defined; nodal and adjacency segments.  A
   nodal segment represents a path to a node, whereas an adjacency
   segment represents a specific adjacency to a node.  A Segment
   Identifier (SID) is a 32-bit value and can be applied to both IP and
   MPLS data planes.  In the case of the MPLS data plane, an SR path
   corresponds to an MPLS Label Switching Path (LSP)

   A Segment Routed path (SR path) can be derived from an IGP Shortest
   Path Tree (SPT).  Segment Routed Traffic Engineering paths (SR-TE
   paths) may not follow IGP SPT.  Such paths may be chosen by a
   suitable network planning tool and provisioned on the source node of
   the SR-TE path.

   [RFC5440] describes Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) for
   communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path
   Control Element (PCE) or between one a pair of PCEs.  A PCE computes
   paths for MPLS Traffic Engineering LSPs (MPLS-TE LSPs) based on
   various constraints and optimization criteria.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies extensions to PCEP that allow a
   stateful PCE to compute and recommend network paths in compliance
   with [RFC4657].  Stateful PCEP extensions provide synchronization of
   LSP state between a PCC and a PCE or between a pair of PCEs,
   delegation of LSP control, reporting of LSP state from a PCC to a
   PCE, controlling the setup and path routing of an LSP from a PCE to a
   PCC.  Stateful PCEP extensions are intended for an operational model
   in which LSPs are configured on the PCC, and control over them is
   delegated to the PCE.  [I-D.crabbe-pce-stateful-pce-mpls-te] builds
   on [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] to specify objects and TLVs for
   MPLS-TE LSPs.  Moreover, a mechanism to dynamically instantiate LSPs
   on a PCC based on the requests from a stateful PCE or a controller
   using stateful PCE is specified in
   [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].  Such mechanism is useful in
   Software Driven Networks (SDN) applications, such as demand
   engineering, or bandwidth calendaring.

   It is possible to use a stateful PCE for computing one or more SR-TE
   paths taking into account various constraints and objective
   functions.  Once a path is chosen, the stateful PCE can instantiate
   an SR-TE path on the PCC using PCEP extensions specified in
   [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] along with the SR specific PCEP

3.  Overview of PCEP Operation in SR Networks

   In SR networks, an ingress node of an SR path appends all outgoing
   packets with an SR header consisting of a list of Segment IDs (SIDs).
   The header has all necessary information to guide the packets from
   the ingress node to the egress node of the path, and hence there is
   no need for any signaling protocol.  A SID can represent a nodal
   segment representing a path to a node or adjacency segment
   representing path over a specific adjacency.

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing         June 2013


   In a PCEP session, path information is carried in the Explicit Route
   Object (ERO), which consists of a sequence of subobjects.  Various
   types of ERO subobjects have been specified in [RFC3209], [RFC3473],
   and [RFC3477].  In SR networks, a PCE needs to specify ERO containing
   SIDs, and a PCC should be capable of processing such ERO.  An ERO
   containing SIDs can be included in the PCEP Create message (PCCreate)
   defined in [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp], as well as in the PCEP
   Update (PCUpd) and PCEP Report (PCRpt) messages defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

   When a PCEP session between a PCC and a PCE is established, both PCEP
   Speakers exchange information to indicate their ability to support
   SR-specific functionality.  A PCEP session can carry EROs of
   different types.  However, an ERO carrying SIDs MUST NOT include any
   other form of EROs, i.e., all subobjects within an ERO MUST represent
   SID.  Furthermore, if an SR path is established using SR-ERO,
   subsequent PCEP Update and Report messages for that path MUST NOT
   contain other ERO types.  This document specifies new error codes to
   handle these errors.  Should the need to change the ERO type arise,
   the SR path must be deleted and re-created using a new ERO type.

   A PCC can include an RRO object in a PCRpt message.  In SR networks,
   a PCC MAY learn the SR actual path actually taken by data packets and
   report that path to a PCE.  For this purpose, we introduce a new RRO
   subobject type.  However, methods used by a PCC to learn SR-TE paths
   are outside the scope of this document.

   In summary, this document specifies a new PCEP capability, a new ERO
   subobject, a new RRO subobject, and new PCEP error codes.


4.  SR Capability Negotiation

   The format of the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is shown in the
   following figure:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   The value comprises a single field - Flags (32 bits).  The U and S
   flags are defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].  The I flag is
   defined in [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].

   A new flag - the "R bit" - is used to negotiate the SR capability
   between a PCE and a PCC.

4.1.  Negotiating SR Capability

   By setting the R-bit to 1, a PCEP Speaker indicates that it is SR-
   capable, i.e., it is able to perform SR related PCEP functions
   specified in this document.  An SR-capable PCEP Speaker must be able
   to handle EROs containing SIDs (referred to as "SR-EROs" in this
   document).  A PCEP Speaker MAY originate SR-ERO only if both PCEP
   Speakers in a PCEP session are SR-capable.  A pair of SR-capable PCEP
   Speakers can exchange SR-EROs in PCCreate and PCUpd messages.
   Similarly, an SR-capable PCEP Speaker must be able to handle RROs
   containing SIDs (referred to as "SR-RRO" in this document).  A pair
   of PCEP Speakers can exchange SR-RROs in PCRpt message.


5.  SR-ERO objects

   An SR-TE path consists of one or more SID(s) where each SID is
   associated with the identifier that represents the node or adjacency
   corresponding to the SID.  This identifier is referred to as the
   'Node or Adjacency Identifie'r (NAI).  As described later, a NAI can
   be represented in various formats (e.g., IPv4 address, IPv6 address,
   etc).  Furthermore, a NAI is used only for troubleshooting purposes,
   and MUST not be used to replace or modify any fields in a data packet
   header.  An SR-ERO object consists of one or more ERO subobjects
   described in the following section.

5.1.  The SR-ERO Subobject

   An SR-ERO subobject consists of a 32-bit header followed by the SID
   and the NAI associated with the SID.  The SID is a 32-bit number.
   The size of the NAI depends on its respective type, as described in
   the following sections.

                     Figure 2: SR-ERO Subobject format

   The fields in the ERO Subobject are as follows:

   The 'L' Flag  indicates whether the subobject represents a loose-hop
      in the explicit route [RFC3209].  If this flag is unset, a PCC
      MUST not overwrite the SID value present in the SR-ERO subobject.
      Otherwise, a PCC MAY expand or replace one or more SID value(s) in
      the received SR-ERO based on its local policy.


   Type  is the type of the SR-ERO Subobject.  This document defines the
      SR-ERO Subobject type.  A new code point will be requested for the
      SR-ERO Subobject from IANA.


   Length  contains the total length of the subobject in octets,
      including the L, Type and Length fields.  Length MUST be at least
      4, and MUST be a multiple of 4.


   SID Type (ST)  indicates the type of information associated with the
      SID contained in the object body.  The SID-Type values are
      described later in this document.


   Flags  is used to carry any additional information pertaining to SID.
      Currently, the following flag bits are defined:



      *  M: When this bit is set, the SID value represents an MPLS label
         stack entry as specified in [RFC5462] where only the label
         value is specified by the PCE.  Other fields (TC, S, and TTL)
         fields MUST be considered invalid, and PCC MUST set these
         fields according to its local policy and MPLS forwarding rules.

      *  C: When this bit as well as the M bit are set, then the SID
         value represents an MPLS label stack entry as specified in
         [RFC5462], where all the entry's fields (Label, TC, S, and TTL)
         are specified by the PCE.  However, a PCC MAY choose to
         override TC, S, and TTL values according its local policy and
         MPLS forwarding rules.


      *  S: When this bit is set, the SID value in the subobject body is
         null.  In this case, the PCC is responsible for choosing the
         SID value, e.g., by looking up its Traffic Engineering Database
         (TED) using node/adjacency identifier in the subobject body.


      *  F: When this bit is set, the NAI value in the subobject body is
         null.


   SID  is the Segment Identifier.


   NAI  contains the NAI associated with the SID.  Depending on the
      value of ST, the NAI can have different format as described in the
      following section.

5.2.  NAI Associated with SID

   This document defines the following NAIs:

   'IPv4 Node ID'  is specified as an IPv4 address.  In this case, ST
      and Length are 1 and 12 respectively.


   'IPv6 Node ID'  is specified as an IPv6 address.  In this case, ST
      and Length are 2 and 20 respectively.


   'IPv4 Adjacency'  is specified as a pair of IPv4 addresses.  In this
      case, ST and Length are 3 and 16 repectively, and the format of
      the NAI is shown in the following figure:

5.3.  SR-ERO Processing

   A PCEP Speaker that does not recognize the new ERO subobject in the
   PCCreate, PCUpd or PCRpt message MUST reject the entire PCEP message
   and MUST send a PCE error message with Error-Type="Unknown Object" or
   "Not supported object", defined in [RFC5440].

   When the SID represents an MPLS label (i.e. the M bit is set), its
   value (20 most significant bits) MUST be larger than 15, unless it is
   special purpose label, such as an Entropy Label Indicator (ELI) or an
   Entropy Label (EL).  If a PCEP Speaker receives a label ERO subobject
   with an invalid value, it MUST send the PCE error message with Error-
   Type = "Reception of an invalid object" and Error-Value = "Bad label
   value".  If both M and C bits of an ERO subobject are set, and if a
   PCEP Speaker finds erroneous setting in one or more of TC, S, and TTL
   fields, it MUST send a PCE error with Error-Type = "Reception of an
   invalid object" and Error-Value = "Bad label format".

   If a PCC receives a stack of SR-ERO subobjects, and the number of
   stack exceeds the maximum number of SIDs that the PCC can impose on
   the packet, it MAY send a PCE error with Error-Type = "Reception of
   an invalid object" and Error-Value = "Unsupported number of Segment
   ERO subobjects".


6.  The SR-RRO Object

   An SR-RRO objects consists of one or more subobject(s), each carrying
   a SID and the associated NAI.  The format of the SR-RRO subobject is
   the same as the ERO subobject, except for L-flag which does not
   exists in the SR-RRO Subobject.  Also, there are no flags defined for
   the SR-RRO subobject.

      0                   1                   2                   3

7.  SR Specific PCEP Descriptors

   As defined in [RFC5440], a PCEP message consists of a common header
   followed by a variable length body made up of mandatory and/or
   optional objects.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and
   [I-D.crabbe-pce-stateful-pce-mpls-te] respectively describe the
   stateful PCEP descriptors for general state control and MPLS-TE
   specific state control.  Finally, [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
   specifies the PCEP descriptors for PCE-based LSP instantiation.  This
   document specifies the SR specific PCEP descriptors.

7.1.  PCEP Descriptor for PCCreate Message

   The format of the PCCreate message is as follows:

      <PCCreate Message> ::= <Common Header>
                          <sr-path-instantiation-list>
   Where:

      <sr-path-instantiation-list> ::=
           <sr-path-instantiation-request>[<sr-path-instantiation-list>]

      <sr-path-instantiation-request> ::= <LSP>
                                         <SID-ERO> <----- New subobject

   The LSP object in the Common Header MUST include the SYMBOLIC-PATH-
   NAME TLV.

7.2.  PCEP Descriptor for PCRpt Message

   The format of the PCRpt message is as follows:

      <PCRpt Message> ::= <Common Header>
                          <state-report-list>
   Where:

      <state-report-list> ::= <state-report>[<state-report-list>]

      <state-report> ::= <LSP>
                         <SID-RRO> <------- New RRO subobject
                         [<prog-sr-path-list>]

   Where:
      <prog-sr-path-list>::=<prog-sr-path>[<prog-sr-path-list>]

   For SR-TE paths, the path descriptor is defined as follows:

      <prog-sr-path>::=<ERO> <----- New ERO subobject

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing         June 2013


   In the PCRpt message, only the LSP object is considered mandatory.
   All other objects are optional, and may be included for synchronizing
   SR-TE path when PCEP session is re-established.

7.3.  PCEP Descriptor for PCUpd Message

   The format of a PCUpd message is as follows:

     <PCUpd Message> ::= <Common Header>
                          <update-request-list>
   Where:

      <update-request-list> ::=
                            <update-request>[<update-request-list>]

      <update-request> ::= <LSP>
                          [<sr-path-list>]

   Where:
      <sr-path-list>::=<sr-path>[<sr-path-list>]

   For SR-TE paths, the path descriptor is defined as follows:

      <sr-path>::=<SID-ERO> <----- New ERO subobject


   In the PCUpd message, only the LSP object is considered mandatory.
   All other objects are optional, and may be included for synchronizing
   SR-TE paths when PCEP session is re-established.


8.  Backward Compatibility

   An LSR that does not support the SR PCEP capability negotiation
   cannot recognize the SR-ERO subobjects.  As such, it shall send a
   PCEP error with Error-Type = 4 (Not supported object) and Error-Value
   = 2 (Not supported object Type) as per [RFC5440].


9.  Management Considerations

9.1.  Policy

   PCEP implementation:

   o  Can enable SR-PCEP capability either by default or via explicit
      configuration.

Internet-Draft     PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing         June 2013


   o  May generate PCEP error due to unsupported number of SR-ERO
      subobjects either by default or via explicit configuration.

9.2.  The PCEP Data Model

   A PCEP MIB module is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-mib] needs be
   extended to cover additional functionality provided by [RFC5440] and
   [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].  Such extension will cover the
   new functionality specified in this document.


10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC5440] and
   [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] are applicable to this
   specification.  No additional security measure is required.


11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a ERO subobject type (recommended value
   = 5) for the SR-ERO subobject.

   This document also defines new Error-Values for the following new
   error conditions:

    Error-Type  Meaning
       10       Reception of an invalid object
                 Error-value=2:  Bad label value
                 Error-value=3:  Unsupported number of Segment ERO
                                 subobjects
