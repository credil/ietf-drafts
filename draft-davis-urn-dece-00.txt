    A URN Namespace for the Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem
                        draft-davis-urn-dece-00

Abstract

   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace that
   is to be employed by the Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem
   (DECE), LLC. for naming persistent resources published by DECE,
   including XMLSchemas, resource definitions, terms, and other
   structures.  Management activities for these and other resource
   types, as well as their identifiers are provided by the DECE, LLC.

Internet-Draft                  DECE URN                        Sep 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem (DECE) produces
   specifications, working drafts, technical resolutions, schemas,
   stylesheets, etc.

   DECE wishes to provide global, distributed, persistent, location-
   independent names for these resources.

   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) requires that all resources
   provide a system identifier, which must be a URI, in addition to an
   optional public identifier (which provides an alternate mechanism for
   constructing identifiers) and many evolving specifications require
   authors to identify documents by URI alone (XML Namespaces, XML
   Schema, XSLT, etc.).

   DECE would like to assign URNs to some resources in order to retain
   unique, permanent location-independent names for them.

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.


2.  URN Namespace Definition Template

   The following template is provided in accordance with [RFC3406].

   NamespaceID:  dece

   Registration Information:

      Registration Version Number:  1

      Registration Date:  YYYY-MM-DD [RFC Editor, please replace with
         the date of approval of this document for publication as an
         RFC]

   Declared Registrant of the Namespace:

      Registering Organization Name:  Digital Entertainment Content
         Ecosystem, LLC (DECE)

      Address:
         1807 Santa Rita Road
         Suite D235
         Pleasanton, CA 94566

   The Namespace Specific Strings (NSS) of all URNs assigned by DECE
   will conform to the syntax defined in section 2.2 of [RFC2141].  In
   addition, all DECE URN NSSs will consist of a left-to-right series of
   tokens delimited by colons.  The left-to- right sequence of colon-
   delimited tokens corresponds to descending nodes in a tree.  To the
   right of the lowest naming authority node there may be zero, one or
   more levels of hierarchical (although not in the [RFC2396] sense of
   'hierarchy') naming nodes terminating in a rightmost leaf node.  See
   the section entitled "Identifier assignment" below for more on the
   semantics of NSSs.  This syntax convention is captured in the
   following normative Backus-Naur Form (BNF) rules for DECE NSSs:

   <DECEID> ::= "urn:dece:"<DECE-NSS>

   For example:

      urn:dece:apid:isan:000000018947000000000000:a203

      urn:dece:type:policy:TermsOfUse

2.2.  Identifier Uniqueness Considerations

   Identifiers are assigned by the DECE Technical Working Group.  In the
   process of identifier assignment, the registration authority confirms
   assignment against the record of previously assigned names.

2.3.  Identifier Persistence Considerations

   The assignment process guarantees that names are not reassigned and
   that the binding between the name and its resource is permanent,
   regardless of any standards or organizational changes.

2.4.  Process of identifier assignment

   Names are assigned by the DECE Technical Working Group.

2.5.  Process of identifier resolution

   At this time no resolution mechanism is specified.

2.6.  Rules for Lexical Equivalence

   Lexical equivalence of two DECE namespace specific strings (NSSs) is
   defined as an exact, case-insensitive string match.

2.7.  Conformance with URN Syntax

   No special considerations.  The syntax is fully conformant with
   [RFC2141].

2.8.  Validation mechanism

   None.

2.9.  Scope

   The scope shall be global.


3.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) and elements defined in the URN Syntax [RFC2141].  This
   syntax here is derived from the syntax definition in [DSystem].


   <DECE-NSS>  ::= "urn:dece:"<type>":"<scheme>":"<SSID>
   (* Types are explicitly defined in [DSystem],
      omitted here for brevity *)
   <type> ::= 1*<URN chars>
   <scheme> ::= 1*<URN chars>
   <SSID> ::= <organization>":"<UID>
   <organization> ::= 1*<URN chars>
   <UID> ::= 1*<URN chars>

4.  Security Considerations

   Since there is no defined resolution mechanism for DECE URNs it is
   difficult to authenticate the fact that a given namespace actually
   adheres to the standard, thus applications should be careful to not
   take some unverified sources assertion that what it is sending
   adheres to what the actual URN is assigned to.


5.  Namespace Considerations

   DECE-NSS identifiers are reserved for use in identifying system
   entities, resources, namespaces and works, among others, for the
   incorporation in DECE client processing and protocol messages


6.  Community Considerations

   While there is no resolution mechanism for this namespace, the names
   themselves are exposed to consumers of DECE defined resource within
   this namespace.  There are circumstances where objects from the DECE
   ecosystem will become exposed to the general Internet.  In these
   cases, the use of the DECE namespace will provide general
   interoperability benefits to the Internet at large.  Additionally,
   there may be subcomponents of the DECE specifications that may be
   adopted by other standards, in which case the URNs used to identify
   those components and specifications can be easily used to enhance
   other, non-DECE based, systems.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes a URN Namespace registration that is to be
   entered into the IANA registry for URN NIDs.
