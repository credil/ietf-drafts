Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP            April 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This EPP mapping
   specifies a flexible schema that can be used to implement several
   common use cases related to the provisioning and management of domain
   name registrations and applications during the launch of a domain
   name registry.

   It is typical for domain registries to operate in special modes
   during their initial launch to facilitate allocation of domain names,
   often according to special rules.  This document uses the term
   "launch phase" and the shorter form "launch" to refer to such a
   period.

   The EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731] is designed for the steady-
   state operation of a registry.  During a launch period, the model in
   place may be different from what is defined in the EPP domain name
   mapping [RFC5731].  For example, registries often accept multiple
   applications for the same domain name during the "Sunrise" launch
   phase, referred to as a Launch Application.  A Launch Registration
   refers to a registration made during a launch phase when the server
   uses a "first-come, first-served" model.  Even in a "first-come,
   first-served" model, additional steps and information might be
   required, such as trademark information.  In addition, the TMCH
   Functional Specification [1] defines a registry interface for the
   Trademark Claims or "claims" launch phase that includes support for
   presenting a Trademark Claims Notice to the Registrant.  This
   document proposes an extension to the domain name extension in order
   to unambiguously manage the various launch phases known.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   "launch-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0".  The XML namespace prefix
   "launch" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.

   "signedMark-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:signedMark-1.0" that is defined in
   [draft-lozano-smd].  The XML namespace prefix "smd" is used, but
   implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ a proper
   namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and output the
   XML documents.

   "mark-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:mark-1.0" that is defined in
   [draft-lozano-smd].  The XML namespace prefix "mark" is used, but
   implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ a proper
   namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and output the
   XML documents.


2.  Object Attributes

   This extension adds additional elements to the EPP domain name
   mapping [RFC5731].  Only those new elements are described here.

2.1.  Application Identifier

   Servers MAY allow multiple applications, referred to as a Launch
   Application, of the same domain name during its launch phase
   operations.  Upon receiving a valid request to create a Launch
   Application, the server MUST create an application object
   corresponding to the request, assign an application identifier for
   the Launch Application, set the [RFC5731] pendingCreate status, and
   return the application identifier to the client with the <launch:
   applicationID> element.  In order to facilitate correlation, all
   subsequent launch operations on the Launch Application MUST be
   qualified by the previously assigned application identifier using the
   <launch:applicationID> element.

2.2.  Launch Phases

   The server MAY support multiple launch phases sequentially or
   simultaneously.  The <launch:phase> element MUST be included by the
   client to define the target launch phase of the command.  The server
   SHOULD validate the <launch:phase> element against the active phase
   of the server for a create command, and return an EPP error result
   code of 2004 if there is a mismatch.

   The following launch phase values are defined:

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP            April 2013


   sunrise  The phase during which trademark holders can submit
      registrations or applications with trademark information that can
      be validated by the server.
   landrush  A post-Sunrise phase when non-trademark holders are allowed
      to register domain names with steps taken to address a large
      volume of initial registrations.
   claims  The Trademark Claims phase, as defined in the TMCH Functional
      Specification [1], in which a Claims Notice must be displayed to a
      prospective registrant of a domain name that matches trademarks.
   open  A post-launch phase that is also referred to as "steady state".
      Servers MAY require additional trademark protection during this
      phase.
   custom  A custom server launch phase that is defined using the "name"
      attribute.

   For extensibility, the <launch:phase> element includes an OPTIONAL
   "name" attribute that can define a sub-phase or the full name of the
   phase when the <launch:phase> element has the "custom" value.  For
   example, the "claims" launch phase could have two sub-phases that
   include "landrush" and "open".

   Launch phases MAY overlap to support the "claims" launch phase,
   defined in the TMCH Functional Specification [1], and to support a
   traditional "landrush" launch phase.  The overlap of the "claims" and
   "landrush" launch phases SHOULD be handled by setting "claims" as the
   <launch:phase> value and setting "landrush" as the sub-phase with the
   "name" attribute.  For example, the <launch:phase> element SHOULD be
   <launch:phase name="landrush">claims</launch:phase>.

2.3.  Status Values

   A Launch Application or Launch Registration object MAY have a launch
   status value.  The <launch:status> element is used to convey the
   launch status pertaining to the object, beyond what is specified in
   the object mapping.  A Launch Application or Launch Registration MUST
   set the [RFC5731] pendingCreate status if a launch status is
   supported and the launch status is not one of the final statuses,
   including the "allocated" and "rejected" statuses.

   The following status values are defined using the required "s"
   attribute:
   pendingValidation:  The initial state of a newly-created application
      or registration object.  The application or registration requires
      validation, but the validation process has not yet completed.

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP            April 2013


   validated:  The application or registration meets relevant registry
      rules.
   invalid:  The application or registration does not validate according
      to registry rules.
   pendingAllocation:  The allocation of the application or registration
      is pending based on the results of some out-of-band process (for
      example, an auction).
   allocated:  One of two possible end states of an application or
      registration object; the object corresponding to the application
      or registration has been provisioned.
   rejected:  The other possible end state; the application or
      registration object was not provisioned.
   custom:  A custom status that is defined using the "name" attribute.

   Each status value MAY be accompanied by a string of human-readable
   text that describes the rationale for the status applied to the
   object.  The OPTIONAL "lang" attribute MAY be present to identify the
   language if the negotiated value is something other than the default
   value of "en" (English).

   For extensibility the <launch:status> element includes an OPTIONAL
   "name" attribute that can define a sub-status or the full name of the
   status when the status value is "custom".  The server SHOULD NOT use
   the "custom" status value.

   Certain status values MAY be combined.  For example, an application
   or registration may be both "invalid" and "rejected".  Additionally,
   certain statuses MAY be skipped.  For example, an application or
   registration MAY immediately start at the "allocated" status or an
   application or registration MAY skip the "pendingAllocation" status.
   If the launch phase does not require validation of a request, an
   application or registration MAY immediately skip to
   "pendingAllocation".  If the <domain:create> command processes a
   request synchronously without the use of an intermediate application,
   then an Application Identifier (Section 2.1) MAY not be needed along
   with the application status.

2.4.  Poll Messaging

   A Launch Application MUST and a Launch Registration MAY be handled as
   a domain name of [RFC5731] in "pendingCreate" status, with the launch
   status values defined in Section 2.3.  As a Launch Application or
   Launch Registration transitions between the status values defined in
   Section 2.3, the server SHOULD insert poll messages, per [RFC5730],
   for the applicable intermediate statuses, including the
   "pendingValidation", "validated", "pendingAllocation, and "invalid"
   statuses, using the <domain:infData> element with the <launch:
   infData> extension.  The <domain:infData> element MAY contain non-
   mandatory information, like contact and name server information.
   Also, further extensions that would normally be included in the
   response of a <domain:info> command, per [RFC5731], MAY be included.
   For the final statuses, including the "allocated" and "rejected"
   statuses, the server MUST insert a <domain:panData> poll message, per
   [RFC5731], with the <launch:infData> extension.

2.5.  Mark Validation Models

   A server MUST support at least one of the following models for
   validating trademark information:

   code  Use of a mark code by itself to validate that the mark matches
      the domain name.  This model is supported using the <launch:
      codeMark> element with just the <launch:code> element.





Tan, et al.             Expires October 19, 2013               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP            April 2013


   mark  The mark information is passed without any other validation
      element.  The server will use some custom form of validation to
      validate that the mark information is authentic.  This model is
      supported using the <launch:codeMark> element with just the <mark:
      mark> (Section 2.6) element.
   code with mark:  A code is used along with the mark information by
      the server to validate the mark utilizing an external party.  The
      code represents some form of secret that matches the mark
      information passed.  This model is supported using the <launch:
      codeMark> element that contains both the <launch:code> and the
      <mark:mark> (Section 2.6) elements.
   signed mark:  The mark information is digitally signed as described
      in the Digital Signature (Section 2.7) section.  The digital
      signature can be directly validated by the server using the public
      key of the external party that created the signed mark using its
      private key.  This model is supported using the <smd:signedMark>
      (Section 2.7.1) and <smd:encodedSignedMark> (Section 2.7.2)
      elements.

   More than one <launch:codeMark>, <smd:signedMark> (Section 2.7.1), or
   <smd:encodedSignedMark> (Section 2.7.2) element MAY be specified.
   The maximum number of marks per domain name is up to server policy.

2.5.1.  <launch:codeMark> element

   The <launch:codeMark> element that is used by the "code", "mark", and
   "code with mark" validation models, has the following child elements:

   <launch:code>:  OPTIONAL mark code used to validate the <mark:mark>
      (Section 2.6) information.  The mark code is be a mark-specific
      secret that the server can verify against a third party.
   <mark:mark>:  OPTIONAL mark information with child elements defined
      in the Mark (Section 2.6) section.

   The following is an example <launch:codeMark> element with both a
   <launch:code> and <mark:mark> (Section 2.6) element.

   <launch:codeMark>
     <launch:code>49FD46E6C4B45C55D4AC</launch:code>
     <mark:mark xmlns:mark="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:mark-1.0">
       ...
     </mark:mark>
   </launch:codeMark>

2.6.  Mark

   A <mark:mark> element describes an applicant's prior right to a given
   domain name that is used with the "mark", "mark with code", and the

   "signed mark" validation models.  The <mark:mark> element is defined
   in [draft-lozano-smd].  A new mark format can be supported by
   creating a new XML schema for the mark that has an element that
   substitutes for the <mark:abstractMark> element from
   [draft-lozano-smd].

2.7.  Digital Signature

   Digital signatures MAY be used by the server to validate either the
   mark information, when using the "signed mark" validation model with
   the <smd:signedMark> (Section 2.7.1) element or the <smd:
   encodedSignedMark> (Section 2.7.2) element.

2.7.1.  <smd:signedMark> element

   The <smd:signedMark> element contains the digitally signed mark
   information.  The <smd:signedMark> element is defined in
   [draft-lozano-smd].  A new signed mark format can be supported by
   creating a new XML schema for the signed mark that has an element
   that substitutes for the <smd:abstractSignedMark> element from
   [draft-lozano-smd].

2.7.2.  <smd:encodedSignedMark> element

   The <smd:encodedSignedMark> element contains an encoded form of the
   digitally signed <smd:signedMark> (Section 2.7.1) element.  The <smd:
   encodedSignedMark> element is defined in [draft-lozano-smd].  A new
   encoded signed mark format can be supported by creating a new XML
   schema for the encoded signed mark that has an element that
   substitutes for the <smd:encodedSignedMark> element from
   [draft-lozano-smd].


3.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in the Launch Phase
   Extension.

   This mapping is designed to be flexible, requiring only a minimum set
   of required elements.

   While it is meant to serve several use cases, it does not prescribe
   any interpretation by the client or server.  Such processing is
   typically highly policy-dependent and therefore specific to
   implementations.

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP            April 2013


   Operations on application objects are done via one or more of the
   existing EPP verbs defined in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731].
   Registries may choose to support a subset of the operations.

3.1.  EPP <check> Command

   There are two forms of the extension to the EPP <check> command that
   include the Claims Check Form (Section 3.1.1) and the Availability
   Check Form (Section 3.1.2).  The <launch:check> element "type"
   attribute defines the form, with the value of "claims" for the Claims
   Check Form (Section 3.1.1) and with the value of "avail" for the
   Availability Check Form (Section 3.1.2).  The default value of the
   "type" attribute is "claims".  The check forms supported is up to
   server policy.  The server MUST return an EPP error result code of
   2307 if it receives a check form that is not supported.

3.1.1.  Claims Check Form

   The Claims Check Form defines additional elements to extend the EPP
   <check> command and response to be used in conjunction with the EPP
   domain name mapping [RFC5731].  This form is the default form and MAY
   be explicitly identified by setting the <launch:check> "type"
   attribute to "claims".

   The Claims Check Form defines a new command called the Claims Check
   Command that is used to determine whether or not there are any
   matching trademarks, in the specified launch phase, for each domain
   name passed in the command.  The availability check information
   defined in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731] MUST NOT be returned
   for the Claims Check Command.

   Instead of returning whether the domain name is available, the Claims
   Check Command will return whether or not at least one matching
   trademark exists for the domain name.  If there is at least one
   matching trademark that exists for the domain name, a <launch:
   claimKey> element is returned.  The client may then use the value of
   the <launch:claimKey> element to obtain information needed to
   generate the trademark Claims Notice from a third-party trademark
   validator such as the Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH).  The third
   party trademark validator should also return a unique notice
   identifier that can be passed in the <launch:noticeID> element of the
   extension to the Create Command (Section 3.3).

   The <domain:name> elements in the EPP <check> command of EPP domain
   name mapping [RFC5731] define the domain names to check for matching
   trademarks.  The <launch:check> element contains the following child
   elements:




Tan, et al.             Expires October 19, 2013               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP            April 2013


   <launch:phase>  The launch phase that SHOULD be "claims".

   Example Claims Check command using the <check> domain command and the
   <launch:check> extension with the "type" explicitly set to "claims",
   to determine if "example1.tld" and "example2.tld" have any matching
   trademarks during the "claims" launch phase:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
     <command>
      <check>
       <domain:check
        xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
         <domain:name>example1.tld</domain:name>
         <domain:name>example2.tld</domain:name>
       </domain:check>
      </check>
      <extension>
       <launch:check
        xmlns:launch="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0"
        type="claims">
         <launch:phase>claims</launch:phase>
       </launch:check>
      </extension>
      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
     </command>
   </epp>

   If the <check> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain a child <launch:chkData> element that
   identifies the launch namespace.  The <launch:chkData> element
   contains the following child elements:

   <launch:phase>  The launch phase that SHOULD be "claims".
   <launch:cd>  One or more <launch:cd> elements that contain the
       following child elements:

       <launch:name>  Contains the fully qualified name of the queried
           domain name.  This element MUST contain an "exists" attribute
           whose value indicates if a matching trademark exists for the
           domain name.  A value of "1" (or "true") means that a
           matching trademark does exist for the claims launch phase.  A
           value of "0" (or "false") means that a matching trademark
           does not exist.

       <launch:claimKey>  An OPTIONAL claim key that MAY be passed to a
           third-party trademark validator such as the Trademark
           Clearinghouse (TMCH) for querying the information needed to
           generate a Trademark Claims Notice.  The <launch:claimKey> is
           used as the key for the query in place of the domain name to
           securely query the service without using a well-known value
           like a domain name.

   Example Claims Check response when no matching trademarks are found
   for the domain name example1.tld and matching trademarks are found
   for the domain name example2.tld for the "claims" launch phase:

3.1.2.  Availability Check Form

   The Availability Check Form defines additional elements to extend the
   EPP <check> command described in the EPP domain name mapping
   [RFC5731].  No additional elements are defined for the EPP <check>
   response.  This form MUST be identified by setting the <launch:check>
   "type" attribute to "avail".

   The EPP <check> command is used to determine if an object can be
   provisioned within a repository.  Domain names may be made available

   only in unique launch phases, whilst remaining unavailable for
   concurrent launch phases.  In addition to the elements expressed in
   the <domain:check>, the command is extensed with the <launch:check>
   element that contains the following child elements:

   <launch:phase>  The launch phase to which domain name availability
       should be determined.

   Example Availability Check Form command using the <check> domain
   command and the <launch:check> extension with the "type" set to
   "avail", to determine the availability of two domain names in the
   "idn-release" custom launch phase:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
     <command>
      <check>
       <domain:check
        xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
         <domain:name>example1.tld</domain:name>
         <domain:name>example2.tld</domain:name>
       </domain:check>
      </check>
      <extension>
       <launch:check
        xmlns:launch="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0"
        type="avail">
         <launch:phase name="idn-release">custom</launch:phase>
       </launch:check>
      </extension>
      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
     </command>
   </epp>

   The Availability Check Form does not define any extension to the
   response of an <check> domain command.  After processing the command,
   the server replies with a standard EPP response as defined in the EPP
   domain name mapping [RFC5731].

3.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <info>
   command and response to be used in conjunction with the EPP domain
   name mapping [RFC5731].

   The EPP <info> command is used to retrieve information for a launch
   phase registration or application.  The Application Identifier
   (Section 2.1) returned in the <launch:creData> element of the create

   response (Section 3.3) is used for retrieving information for a
   Launch Application.  A <launch:info> element is sent along with the
   regular <info> domain command.  The <launch:info> element includes an
   OPTIONAL "includeMark" boolean attribute, with a default value of
   "false", to indicate whether or not to include the mark in the
   response.  The <launch:info> element contains the following child
   elements:

   <launch:phase>  The phase during which the application or
       registration was submitted or is associated with.  Server policy
       defines the phases that are supported.
   <launch:applicationID>  OPTIONAL application identifier of the Launch
       Application.

   Example <info> domain command with the <launch:info> extension to
   retrieve information for the sunrise application for example.tld and
   application identifier "abc123":

   infData> contains the following child elements:

   <launch:phase>  The phase during which the application was submitted,
       or is associated with, that matches the associated <info> command
       <launch:phase>.
   <launch:applicationID>  OPTIONAL Application Identifier of the Launch
       Application.
   <launch:status>  OPTIONAL status of the Launch Application using one

3.3.  EPP <create> Command

   There are three forms of the extension to the EPP <create> command
   that include the Sunrise Create Form (Section 3.3.1), the Claims
   Create Form (Section 3.3.2), and the General Create Form
   (Section 3.3.3).  The form is dependent on the supported launch
   phases (Section 2.2) as defined below.

   sunrise  The EPP <create> command with the "sunrise" launch phase is
      used to submit a registration with trademark information that can
      be verified by the server with the <domain:name> value.  The
      Sunrise Create Form (Section 3.3.1) is used for the "sunrise"
      launch phase.
   landrush  The EPP <create> command with the "landrush" launch phase
      MAY use the General Create Form (Section 3.3.3) to explictly
      specify the phase and optionally define the expected type of
      object to create.
   claims  The EPP <create> command with the "claims" launch phase is
      used to pass the information associated with the presentation and
      acceptance of the Claims Notice.  The Claims Create Form
      (Section 3.3.2) is used and the General Create Form
      (Section 3.3.3) MAY be used for the "claims" launch phase.
   open  The EPP <create> command with the "open" launch phase is
      undefined but the form supported is up to server policy.
   custom  The EPP <create> command with the "custom" launch phase is
      undefined but the form supported is up to server policy.

   A server MAY support a mix of the create forms, where for example the
   Sunrise Create Form (Section 3.3.1) and the Claims Create Form
   (Section 3.3.2) MAY be supported in a single command by including
   both the verified trademark information and the information related
   to the registrant's acceptance of the Claims Notice.  The "custom"
   launch phase SHOULD be used when using a mix of the create forms.

   the server uses to match against the domain name to authorize the
   domain create.  A server MUST support one of four models in Claim
   Validation Models (Section 2.5) to verify the trademark information
   passed by the client.

   A <launch:create> element is sent along with the regular <create>
   domain command.  The <launch:create> element has an OPTIONAL "type"
   attribute that defines the expected type of object ("application" or
   "registration") to create.  The server SHOULD validate the "type"
   attribute, when passed, against the type of object that will be
   created.  The <launch:create> element contains the following child
   elements:

   <launch:phase>  The identifier for the launch phase.
   <launch:codeMark> or <smd:signedMark> or <smd:encodedSignedMark>
       <launch:codeMark>  Zero or more <launch:codeMark> elements.  The
           <launch:codeMark> child elements are defined in the <launch:
           codeMark> element (Section 2.5.1) section.
       <smd:signedMark>  Zero or more <smd:signedMark> elements.  The

3.3.3.  General Create Form

   The General Create Form of the extension to the EPP domain name
   mapping [RFC5731] includes the launch phase and optionally the object
   type to create.  The OPTIONAL "type" attribute defines the expected
   type of object ("application" or "registration") to create.  The
   server SHOULD validate the "type" attribute, when passed, against the
   type of object that will be created.

   A <launch:create> element is sent along with the regular <create>
   domain command.  The <launch:create> element contains the following
   child elements:

   <launch:phase>  Contains the value of the active launch phase of the
       server.  The server SHOULD validate the value against the active
       server launch phase.

   The following is an example <create> domain command using the
   <launch:create> extension for a "landrush" launch phase application:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
     <command>
       <create>
         <domain:create
          xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
           <domain:name>example.tld</domain:name>
           <domain:registrant>jd1234</domain:registrant>

3.3.4.  Create Response

   If the create was successful, the server MAY reply with the <launch:
   creData> element along with the regular EPP <resData> to indicate the
   server generated Application Identifier (Section 2.1), when multiple
   applications of a given domain name is supported; otherwise no
   extension is included with the regular EPP <resData>.  The <launch:
   creData> element contains the following child elements:

   <launch:phase>  The phase of the application that mirrors the
       <launch:phase> element included in the <launch:create>.
   <launch:applicationID>  The application identifier of the
       application.

   An example response when multiple overlapping applications are
   supported by the server:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
     <response>

3.4.  EPP <update> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <update>
   command to be used in conjunction with the domain name mapping.

   A server that does not support multiple applications of a given
   domain name with an Application Identifier (Section 2.1) during its
   launch phase operations MUST return an EPP error result code of 2102.

   Registry policies permitting, clients may update an application
   object by submitting an EPP <update> command along with a <launch:
   update> element to indicate the application object to be updated.
   The <launch:update> element contains the following child elements:

   <launch:phase>  The phase during which the application was submitted
       or is associated with.
   <launch:applicationID>  The application identifier for which the
       client wishes to update.

   This extension does not define any extension to the response of an
   <update> domain command.  After processing the command, the server
   replies with a standard EPP response as defined in the EPP domain
   name mapping [RFC5731].

3.5.  EPP <delete> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <delete>
   command to be used in conjunction with the domain name mapping.

   A server that does not support multiple applications of a given
   domain name with an Application Identifier (Section 2.1) during its

   6.  Split the "claims" launch phase to the "claims1" and "claims2"
       launch phases.

       addr> element.
   5.  Updated note on replication of the EPP contact mapping elements
       in the Mark Contact section.

6.6.  Change from 05 to 06

   1.  Removed the definition of the mark-1.0 and signedMark-1.0 and
       replaced with reference to draft-lozano-smd, that contains the
       definition for the mark, signed marked, and encoded signed mark.
   2.  Split the <launch:timestamp> into <launch:generatedDate> and
       <launch:acceptedDate> based on feedback from Trung Tran.
   3.  Added the "includeMark" optional attribute to the <launch:info>
       element to enable the client to request whether or not to include
       the mark in the info response.
   4.  Fixed state diagram to remove redundant transition from "invalid"
       to "rejected"; thanks Klaus Malorny.

6.7.  Change from 06 to 07

   1.  Proof-read grammar and spelling.
   2.  Changed "pendingAuction" status to "pendingAllocation", changed
       "pending" to "pendingValidation" status, per proposal from Trung
       Tran and seconded by Rubens Kuhl.
   3.  Added text related to the use of RFC 5731 pendingCreate to the
       Application Identifier section.
   4.  Added the Poll Messaging section to define the use of poll
       messaging for intermediate state transitions and pending action
       poll messaging for final state transitions.

6.8.  Change from 07 to 08

   1.  Added support for use of the launch statuses and poll messaging
       for Launch Registrations based on feedback from Sharon Wodjenski
       and Trung Tran.
   2.  Incorporated changes based on updates or clarifications in
       draft-lozano-tmch-func-spec-01, which include:
       1.  Removed the unused <launch:generatedDate> element.
       2.  Removed the <launch:source> element.
       3.  Added the <launch:notAfter> element based on the required
           <tmNotice:notAfter> element.

6.9.  Change from 08 to 09

   1.  Made <choice> element optional in <launch:create> to allow
       passing just the <launch:phase> in <launch:create> per request
       from Ben Levac.
   2.  Added optional "type" attribute in <launch:create> to enable the
       client to explicitly define the desired type of object
       (application or registration) to create to all forms of the
       create extension.
   3.  Added text that the server SHOULD validate the <launch:phase>
       element in the Launch Phases section.
   4.  Add the "General Create Form" to the create command extension to
       support the request from Ben Levac.
   5.  Updated the text for the Poll Messaging section based on feedback
       from Klaus Malorny.
   6.  Replaced the "claims1" and "claims2" phases with the "claims"
       phase based on discussion on the provreg list.
   7.  Added support for a mixed create model (Sunrise Create Model and
       Claims Create Model), where a trademark (encoded signed mark,
       etc.) and notice can be passed, based on a request from James
       Mitchell.
   8.  Added text for the handling of the overlapping "claims" and
       "landrush" launch phases.
   9.  Added support for two check forms (claims check form and
       availability check form) based on a request from James Mitchell.
       The availability check form was based on the text in
       draft-rbp-application-epp-mapping.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].  Three URI
   assignments have been registered by the IANA.

   Registration request for the Launch namespace:

Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP            April 2013


      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0
      Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
      document.
      XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.


8.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [RFC5730], the EPP
   domain name mapping [RFC5731], and protocol layers used by EPP.  The
   security considerations described in these other specifications apply
   to this specification as well.

   Updates to, and deletion of an application object must be restricted
   to clients authorized to perform the said operation on the object.

   As information contained within an application, or even the mere fact
   that an application exists may be confidential.  Any attempt to
   operate on an application object by an unauthorized client MUST be
   rejected with an EPP 2303 (object does not exist) or an appropriate
   auhorization error.  Server policy may allow <info> operation with
   filtered output by clients other than the sponsoring client, in which
   case the <domain:infData> and <launch:infData> response SHOULD be
   filtered to include only fields that are publicly accessible.
