    <abstract>
      <t>Source Description (SDES) items are normally transported in RTP
      control protocol (RTCP). In some cases it can be beneficial to speed up
      the delivery of these items. Mainly when a new source (SSRC) joins an
      RTP session and the receivers needs this source's relation to other
      sources and its synchronization context, which are fully or partially
      identified using SDES items. To enable this optimization, this document
      specifies a new RTP header extension that can carry any type of SDES
      items.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification defines an <xref target="RFC3550">RTP header
      extension</xref><xref target="RFC5285"/> that can carry RTCP source
      description (SDES) items. By including selected SDES items in an header
      extension the determination of relationship and synchronization context
      for new RTP packet streams (SSRCs) in an RTP session can be speeded up.
      Which relationship and what information depends on the SDES items
      carried. This becomes a complement to using only RTCP for SDES Item
      delivery.</t>

      <t>First, some requirements language is defined. The following section
      motivates why this header extension is sometimes required or at least
      provides a significant improvement compared to waiting for regular RTCP
      packet transmissions of the information. This is followed by a
      specification of the header extension. Next, a sub-space of the
      header-extension URN is defined to be used for existing and future SDES
      items, and the existing SDES items are registered.</t>

        Grouping Semantics and Mechanisms for Real-Time Transport Protocol
        (RTP) Sources"</xref> . In particular the following definitions:<list

    <section title="Motivation">
      <t>Source Description (SDES) items are being associated with a
      particular SSRC and thus RTP packet stream. The source description items
      provide various meta data associated with the SSRC. How important it is
      to have this data no later than when receiving the first RTP packets
      depends on the item itself. The CNAME item is one item that is commonly
      needed if not at reception of the first RTP packet for this SSRC, so at
      least by the time the first media can be played out. If not, the
      synchronization context cannot be determined and thus any related
      streams cannot be correctly synchronized. Thus, this is a great example
      for the need to have this information early when a new packet stream is
      received.</t>

      <t>The main reason for new SSRCs in an RTP session is that a media
      sources are added. This either because an end-point is adding a new
      actual media source, or additional participants in a multi-party session
      being added to the session. Another reason for a new SSRC can be an SSRC
      collision that forces the colliding parties to select a new SSRC.</t>

      <t>Returning to the case of rapid media synchronization, there exist an
      RTP header extension for <xref target="RFC6051">Rapid Synchronisation of
      RTP Flows</xref>. That header extension carries the clock information
      present in the RTCP sender report (SR) packets. It however assumes that
      the CNAME binding is known, which can be provided via signalling in some
      cases, but not all. Thus an RTP header extension for carrying SDES items
      like CNAME is a powerful combination to enable rapid synchronization in
      all cases.</t>

      <t>The Rapid Synchronisation of RTP Flows specification does provide an
      analysis of the initial synchronization delay for different sessions
      depending on number of receivers as well as on session bandwidth
      (Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC6051"/>). These results are applicable
      also for other SDES items that have a similar time dependency until the
      information can be sent using RTCP. Thus the benefit for reduction of
      initial delay before information is available can be determined for some
      use cases from these figures.</t>

      <t>That document also discusses the case of late joiners, and defines an
      RTCP Feedback format to request synchronization information, which is
      another potential use case for SDES items in RTP header extension. It
      would for example be natural to include CNAME SDES item with the header
      extension containing the NTP formatted reference clock to ensure
      synchronization.</t>

      <t>Some new SDES items are currently proposed, which can all benefit
      from timely delivery:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="SRCNAME:">This is a media source and encoding
          identifier to enable support for simulcast and improve some scalable
          encoding usages <xref
          target="I-D.westerlund-avtext-rtcp-sdes-srcname"/>. This SDES item
          could be used both for new sources and late joiners.</t>

          <t hangText="APPID:">This SDES item provides an application specific
          identifier dynamically assigned to a particular packet stream. The
          intention is to provide a receiver with information about the
          current role of the received packet stream or its usage in an
          application <xref target="I-D.even-mmusic-application-token"/>. Thus
          a particular ID can be reassigned many times during the lifetime of
          an RTP session. This puts additional timing requirements, not only
          for new sources and late joiners, but also whenever the Application
          token is reassigned to another stream.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Based on the above, there appear to be good reasons why an RTP header
      extension for SDES items is worthwhile to pursue.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Specification">
      <t>This section first specifies the SDES item RTP header extension
      format, followed by some usage considerations.</t>

      <section title="SDES Item Header Extension">
        <t>The RTP header extension scheme that allows for multiple extensions
        to be included is defined in <xref target="RFC5285">"A General
        Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions"</xref>. That specification
        defines both short and long item headers. The short headers (One-byte)
        are restricted to 1 to 16 bytes of data, while the long format
        (Two-byte) supports a data length of 0 to 255 bytes. Thus that RTP
        header extension format is capable of supporting any SDES item from a
        data length perspective.</t>

        <t>The ID field, independent of short or long format, identifies both
        the type of RTP header extension and, in the case of the SDES item
        header extension, the type of SDES item. The mapping is done in
        signalling by identifying the header extension and SDES item type
        using a URN, which is defined in the <xref target="IANA">IANA
        consideration</xref> for all existing SDES items.</t>

        <section title="One-Byte Format">
          <t>The one-byte header format for an SDES item extension element
          consists of the One-Byte header (defined in Section 4.2 of <xref
          target="RFC5285"/>), which consists of a 4-bit ID followed by a
          4-bit length field (len) that identifies how many bytes (len value
          +1) of data that follows the header. The data part consists of len+1
          bytes of UTF-8 text. The type of text is determined by the ID field
          value and its mapping to the type of SDES item.</t>

      <section title="Usage of the SDES Item Header Extension">
        <t>This section discusses various usage considerations; which form of
        header extension to use, the packet expansion, and when to send SDES
        items in header extension.</t>

        <section title="One or Two Byte Headers">
          <t>The RTP header extensions for SDES items MAY use either the
          one-byte or two-byte header formats, depending on the text value
          size for the used SDES items. The one-byte header SHOULD be used
          when all non SDES item header extensions supports the one-byte
          format and all SDES item text values contain at most 16 bytes. Note
          that the RTP header extension specification does not allow mixing
          one-byte and two-byte headers for the same RTP packet stream (SSRC),
          so if the value size of any of the SDES items value requires the
          two-byte header, the all other header extensions MUST also use the
          two-byte header format.</t>

          <t>For example using CNAMEs that are generated according to <xref
          target="RFC7022">"Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol
          (RTCP) Canonical Names (CNAMEs)"</xref>, using short term persistent
          values, and if 96-bit random values prior to base64 encoding are
          sufficient, then they will fit into the One-Byte header format.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="MTU and Packet Expansion">
          <t>The RTP packet size will clearly increase when they include the
          header extension. How much depends on which header extensions and
          their data parts. The SDES items can vary in size. There are also
          some use-cases which require transmitting multiple SDES items in the
          same packet to ensure that all relevant data reaches the receiver.
          An example of that is when you need both the CNAME, a SRCNAME and an
          APPID plus the rapid time synchronization extension from RFC 6051.
          Such a combination is quite likely to result in at least 16+3+1+8
          bytes of data plus the headers, which will be another 8 bytes for
          one-byte headers, thus in total 36 bytes.</t>

          <t>The packet expansion can cause an issue when it cannot be taken
          into account when producing the RTP payload. Thus an RTP payload
          that is created to meet a particular IP level Maximum Transmission
          Unit (MTU), taking the addition of IP/UDP/RTP headers into account
          but excluding RTP header extensions suddenly exceeds the MTU,
          resulting in IP fragmentation. IP fragmentation is known to
          negatively impact the loss rate due to middleboxes unwilling or not
          capable of dealing with IP fragments.</t>

          <t>As this is a real issue, the media encoder and payload packetizer
          should be flexible and be capable of handling dynamically varying
          payload size restrictions to counter the packet expansion caused by
          header extensions. If that is not possible, some reasonable worst
          case packet expansion should be calculated and used to reduce the
          RTP payload size of all RTP packets the sender transmits.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Transmission Considerations">
          <t>The general recommendation is to only send header extensions when
          needed. This is especially true for SDES items that can be sent in
          periodic repetitions of RTCP throughout the whole session. Thus, the
          <xref target="sec-different-usages">different usages</xref> have
          different recommendations. First some general considerations for
          getting the header extensions delivered to the receiver:<list
              style="numbers">
              <t>The probability for packet loss and burst loss determine how
              many repetitions of the header extensions will be required to
              reach a targeted delivery probability, and if bust loss is
              likely what dispersion would be needed to avoid getting multiple
              header extensions lost in a single burst.</t>

              <t>How early the SDES item information is needed, from the first
              received RTP data or only after some set of packets are
              received, can guide if the header extension(s) should be in all
              of the first N packets or be included only once per set of
              packets, for example once per video frame.</t>

              <t>The use of RTP level robustness mechanisms, such as <xref
              target="RFC4588">RTP retransmission</xref>, or Forward Error
              Correction, e.g., <xref target="RFC5109"> </xref> may treat
              packets differently from a robustness perspective, and SDES
              header extensions should be added to packets that get a
              treatment corresponding to the relative importance of receiving
              the information.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In summary, the number of header extension transmissions should
          be tailored to a desired probability of delivery taking the receiver
          population size into account. For the very basic case, N repetitions
          of the header extensions should be sufficient, but may not be
          optimal. N is selected so that probability of delivery of at least
          one out of the N reaches the target value when calculating 1-P^N,
          where P is the probability of packet loss. For point to point or
          small receiver populations, it might also be possible to use
          feedback, such as RTCP, to determine when the information in the
          header extensions has likely reached all receivers.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="sec-different-usages" title="Different Usages">
          <t/>

          <section anchor="sec-new-ssrc" title="New SSRC">
            <t>A new SSRC joins an RTP session. As this SSRC is completely new
            for everyone, the goal is to ensure that all receivers with high
            probability receives the information in the header extension. Thus
            header extension transmission strategies that allow some margins
            in the delivery probability should be considered.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Late Joiner">
            <t>In a multi-party RTP session where one or a small number of
            receivers join a session where the majority of receivers already
            have all necessary information, the use of header extensions to
            deliver relevant information should be tailored to reach the new
            receivers. The trigger to send header extensions can for example
            either be RTCP from new receiver(s) or an explicit request like
            the Rapid Resynchronisation Request defined in <xref
            target="RFC6051"/>.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Information Change">
            <t>In cases when the SDES item text value is changed and the new
            SDES information is tightly coupled to and thus needs to be
            synchronized with a related change in the RTP stream, use of a
            header extension is far superior to RTCP SDES. In this case it is
            equal or even more important with timely SDES information than in
            the case of <xref target="sec-new-ssrc">new SSRCs</xref>.
            Continued use of the old SDES information can lead to really
            undesired effects in the application. <xref
            target="I-D.even-mmusic-application-token">Application
            Token</xref> would be one such case. Thus, header extension
            transmission strategies with high probability of delivery should
            be chosen.</t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section title="SDES Items in RTCP">
          <t>As this RTP header extensions information, i.e. SDES Items can
          and will be sent also in RTCP it is worth some reflections on this
          interaction. There also exist the possibility to schedule a
          non-regular RTCP packet transmission containing important SDES items
          if one uses a RTP/AVPF based RTP profile. Depending on which mode
          ones RTCP feedback transmitter is working on extra RTCP packets may
          be sent as immediate or early packets, enabling more timely deliver
          of SDES information.</t>

          <t>There is however two aspects that differ between using RTP header
          extension and any non-regular transmission of RTCP packets. First,
          as the RTCP packet is a separate packet, there is no direct relation
          and also no fate sharing between the relevant media data and the
          SDES information. The order of arrival for the packets will matter.
          With a header-extension the SDES items can be ensured to arrive if
          the media data to played out arrives. Secondly, it is difficult to
          determine if an RTCP packet is actually delivered. This, as the RTCP
          packets lack both sequence number or a mechanism providing feedback
          on the RTCP packets themselves.</t>

      <t>The reason to require registering a URN within that sub-space is that
      the name represent an RTCP Source Description item, where a
      specification is strongly recommended. The formal policy is maintained
      from the main space, i.e. Expert Review.</t>

      <t>Secondly, it is proposed that all the current existing SDES items are
      registered for usage in the RTP Compact Header Extensions registry :</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Source Description items may contain data that are sensitive from a
      security perspective. There exist SDES items that are or may be
      sensitive from a user privacy perspective, like CNAME, NAME, EMAIL,
      PHONE, LOC and H323-CADDR. Others may contain sensitive information like
      NOTE and PRIV, while others may be sensitive from profiling
      implementations for vulnerability or other reasons, like TOOL. The CNAME
      sensitivity can vary depending on how it is generated and what
      persistence it has. A short term CNAME identifier generated using a
      random number generator may have minimal security implications, while
      one of the form user@host has privacy concerns and one generated from a
      MAC address has long term tracking potentials.</t>

      <t>The above security concerns may have to be put in relation to needs
      of third party monitoring. In RTP sessions where any type of
      confidentiality protection is enabled, the SDES item header extensions
      SHOULD also be protected per default. This implies that to provide
      confidentiality, users of SRTP need to implement encrypted header
      extensions per <xref target="RFC6904"/>. Commonly, it is expected that
      the same security level is applied both RTCP packets carrying SDES
      items, as a RTP header extension containing a SDES item. If the security
      level is different it is important to consider the security properties
      as the worst in each aspect for the different configurations.</t>

      <t>As the SDES items are used by the RTP based application to establish
      relationships between packet streams or between a packet stream and
      information about the originating Participant, there SHOULD be strong
      requirements on integrity and source authentication of the header
      extensions. If not, an attacker can modify the SDES item value to create
      erroneous relationship bindings in the receiving application.</t>
