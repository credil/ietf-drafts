This document defines the Service Location Protocol Version 2's
(SLPv2) use over IPv6 networks.  Since this protocol relies on UDP and
TCP, the changes to support its use over IPv6 are minor.
 
This document does not describe how to use SLPv1 over IPv6 networks.
There is at the time of this publication no implementation or
deployment of SLPv1 over IPv6.  It is RECOMMENDED that SLPv2 be used
in general, and specifically on networks which support IPv6.

This document is a product of the Service Location Protocol
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
