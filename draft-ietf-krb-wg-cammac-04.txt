Internet-Draft  Container Authenticated by Multiple MACs        Feb 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a new Authorization Data container for
   Kerberos, called AD-CAMMAC (Container Authenticated by Multiple
   MACs), that supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED.  The container allows both the
   receiving application service and the Key Distribution Center (KDC)
   itself to verify the authenticity of the contained authorization
   data.  The AD-CAMMAC container can also include additional verifiers
   that "trusted services" can use to verify the contained authorization
   data.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Validation

   Kerberos ticket authorization data are highly sensitive and must be
   validated to insure that no tampering has occurred.  Although
   authorization data are in the encrypted part of a Kerberos ticket and
   therefore have their integrity protected by the ticket encryption,
   clients can request that KDCs insert potentially arbitrary
   authorization data into tickets on their behalf.  The Kerberos
   protocol specifications allow this client behavior because the
   originally envisioned usage of authorization data was to serve as
   restrictions on the client's privileges.  Services that need to
   interpret specific authorization data as granting increased
   privileges need some way to ensure that the KDC originated those
   authorization data.

   In order to validate any information, the receiving application
   service needs to be able to cryptographically verify the data.  This
   is done by introducing a new AuthorizationData element called AD-
   CAMMAC that contains enough information to bind the contents to a
   principal in a way that a receiving application service can verify
   autonomously without further contact with the KDC.

   The following information is needed:

   o  The KDC MAC

   o  The Service MAC

Internet-Draft  Container Authenticated by Multiple MACs        Feb 2013


   o  Optional Trusted Service MAC

   The KDC MAC is required to allow the KDC to validate the data without
   needing to recompute the contents at every Ticket Granting Service
   (TGS) request.

   The Service MAC is required so that the Service can verify that the
   authorization data has been validated by the KDC.

   The Trusted Service MAC is useful to verify the authenticity of the
   contents on the same host, when the data is received by a less
   trusted service and passed to a more trusted service on the same host
   without the need for additional round trips to the KDC.

   The ad-type for AD-CAMMAC is (TBD).


4.  Encoding

   The Kerberos protocol is defined in [RFC4120] using Abstract Syntax
   Notation One (ASN.1) [X.680][X.690].  As such, this specification
   also uses the ASN.1 syntax for specifying both the abstract layout of
   the AD-CAMMAC attributes, as well as its encoding.

4.1.  AD-CAMMAC


      KerberosV5CAMMAC DEFINITIONS EXPLICIT TAGS ::= BEGIN

      AD-CAMMAC                   ::= SEQUENCE {
            elements              [0] AuthorizationData,
            kdc-verifier          [1] Verifier-MAC,
            svc-verifier          [2] Verifier-MAC OPTIONAL,
            other-verifiers       [3] SEQUENCE OF Verifier
      }

      Verifier             ::= CHOICE {
            mac            Verifier-MAC,
            ...
      }

   elements:
      A sequence of authorization data elements issued by the KDC.
      These elements are the authorization data that the verifier fields
      authenticate.

   Verifier:
      A CHOICE type that currently contains only one alternative:
      Verifier-MAC.  Future extensions might add support for public-key
      signatures.

   Verifier-MAC:
      Contains a MAC computed over the encoding of the AuthorizationData
      value in the elements field of the AD-CAMMAC.  The identifier,
      kvno, and enctype fields help the recipient locate the key

      required for verifying the MAC.

   AD-CAMMAC-BINDING:
      An AuthorizationData element that binds the CAMMAC contents to the
      enclosing ticket.  This AuthorizationData element has ad-type
      number TBD, and MUST be absent from the transmitted elements field
      of the AD-CAMMAC.  It MUST be included in the computation of the
      Verifiers as if it were the first element.

   kdc-verifier:
      A Verifier-MAC where the key is the TGS key.  The checksum type is
      the mandatory checksum type for the TGS key.

   svc-verifier:
      A Verifier-MAC where the key is the long-term key of the service
      for which the ticket is issued.  The checksum type is the
      mandatory checksum type for the long-term key of the service.
      This field MUST be present if the service principal of the ticket
      is not the local TGS, including when the ticket is a cross-realm
      TGT.

   other-verifiers:
      A sequence of additional verifiers.  In each additional Verifier-
      MAC, the key is the long-term key of the principal name specified
      in the identifier field.  The PrincipalName MUST be present and be
      a valid principal in the realm.  KDCs MAY add one or more 'trusted
      service' verifiers.  Unless otherwise administratively configured,
      the 'trusted service' SHOULD be found by replacing the service
      identifier component of the principal name of the svc-verifier
      with 'host'.  The checksum type is the mandatory checksum type for
      the long-term key (which one?) of the principal.  The key usage is
      TBD.


5.  Assigned numbers

   TBD


6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.


7.  Security Considerations

   Although authorization data are generally conveyed within the
   encrypted part of a ticket and are thereby protected by the existing



Sorce, et al.            Expires August 5, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Container Authenticated by Multiple MACs        Feb 2013


   encryption methods on the ticket, some authorization data requires
   the additional protection provided by the CAMMAC.

   Extracting a CAMMAC from a ticket for use as a credential removes it
   from the context of the ticket.  In the general case, this could turn
   it into a bearer token, with all of the associated security
   implications.  Also, the CAMMAC does not itself necessarily contain
   sufficient information to identify the client principal (if the
   encoding of AD-CAMMAC-BINDING is omitted from the transmitted
   CAMMAC).  Therefore, application protocols that rely on extracted
   CAMMACs might need to duplicate a substantial portion of the ticket
   contents and include that duplicated information in the authorization
   data contained within the CAMMAC.

   A KDC that needs to verify the contents of a CAMMAC in a non-TGS
   service ticket MUST ensure that the CAMMAC in the ticket is the same
   one that it inserted into the ticket.  A malicious service could
   substitute legitimate CAMMACs from other tickets that it has received
   (but not fabricate completely new CAMMACs) into a service ticket.  A
   CAMMAC by itself does not contain sufficient information to
   accomplish this.
