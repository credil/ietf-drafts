1. Introduction 

   The Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) [RFC6740] is an 
   evolutionary protocol which addresses a wide range of issues 
   including site/host multi-homing, site/host mobility, end-to-end 
   security, etc. ILNP adopts an "Identifier/Locator Split" way to 
   decouple end-to-end transport-layer session state from interfaces and 
   addresses of a node.  

   ILNPv6 is a specific engineering instance of ILNP that is based on 
   IPv6. [RFC6741], [RFC6743] and [RFC6744] describe engineering 
   considerations about ILNPv6 implementation which needs modifications 
   to the protocol stack of hosts. This document describes issues that 
   arise in implementing ILNPv6 according to existing specifications

   together with possible solutions. This document only provides an 
   alternative way to develop ILNPv6 based on Linux, and the goal is to 
   offer experiences which may help the readers to make their own 
   implementations of the protocol.  

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

   Some terms used in this document are defined in [RFC6740]. This 
   document assumes that the reader has read the related RFC: 
   Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) Architectural Description 
   [RFC6740]. 

2. An Alternative Way to Implement ILNPv6  

   This section discusses the implementation challenges and alternative 
   ways to overcome these challenges. The implementation described in 
   this section is based on modifying GNU/Linux kernel 3.2.12. 

2.1. Transport-layer Session State Modification  

   One of the biggest challenges in implementing ILNPv6 is how to 
   maintain transport-layer session state. As is specified in [RFC6740], 
   transport layer on an ILNP node uses only the Identifier value (64 
   bits suffix of IPv6 address) for the transport-layer session state, 
   while current TCP and UDP use the entire IPv6 address as the session 
   state.  

2.1.1. Locator Erasion/Refilling 

   There exist different ways to realize the modification, and the 
   choice proposed in this document is to hide locator values (64 bits 
   prefix of IPv6 address) from the transport layer by adopting locator 
   erasion/refilling. The benefit of this method is that the transport 
   layer will stay untouched while modifications are almost only 
   required in the network layer.  

   Locator erasion requires the network layer to erase the locator part 
   of received ILNP packets (zero the 64 bits prefix) before sending 
   them to the transport layer. The transport layer still regards the 
   packets with zero prefixes as ordinary IPv6 packets and processes 
   them normally. Since the IPv6 address within ILNP packet headers in 
   transport layer contains only Identifier information, Locator changes

   in the network layer will never affect the session states of 
   transport layer protocols.  

   Locator refilling requires the network layer to refill the locator 
   part of outgoing ILNP packets from the transport layer. The locator 
   information is obtained from ILCC introduced in [RFC6740]. After the 
   refilling process, ILNP packets will be forwarded normally as 
   ordinary IPv6 packets. 

   In order to make the implementation compatible with existing Linux 
   IPv6 socket API, Locator erasion/refilling also requires the socket 
   layer to erase the locator part of ILNP packets before sending them 
   to the transport layer and refill the locator part of ILNP packets 
   received from the transport layer.  

   The procedures of Locator erasion/refilling in both packet sending 
   and receiving are shown in Figure 2.1 and described separately in the 
   next two sub-sections.

     Figure 2.1: Locator Erasion/refilling Procedure in protocol stack 

2.1.2. Packet Sending 

   The socket API stays unchanged in this implementation, but the IP 
   addresses maintained in socket are processed by Locator erasion 
   function and are equivalent to Identifiers. Thus data packets 
   delivered to the transport layer do not contain Locator information. 
   Then packets get through the unmodified transport layer and reach the 
   network layer.  

   To handle ILNP packets from the transport layer, modifications are 
   made in the network layer. For each ILNP packet, the network layer

   looks up in the ILCC to get available Locator set and fills the 64 
   bits prefix of the IPv6 address in the packet header. Locator 
   refilling is achieved using Netfilter Hook in this implementation. 
   Specifically, the Locator part is refilled in NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT. After 
   the refilling, ILNP packets will be forwarded as normal IPv6 packets. 

2.1.3. Packet Receiving 

   For each incoming ILNP packet, the network layer needs to judge 
   whether it should be delivered to upper layer protocols for further 
   processing. According to the implementation of Linux IPv6 protocol 
   stack, this is achieved by adding related entries in the routing 
   table. Thus all possible IL-Vectors MUST be added into the table and 
   set as local entries to ensure that all ILNP packets can be correctly 
   received.  

   For each packet whose destination is a local socket, the network 
   layer sets the 64 bits prefix of the IPv6 address in the header to 
   zero and transmit it to the transport layer. Locator erasion is also 
   achieved using Netfilter Hook NF_IP_LOCAL_IN. The packet will be 
   handled normally by the transport layer and then go to the 
   corresponding socket and finally reach the destined application.  

2.2. Identical Identifiers Management 

   If an ILNP node simultaneously has two or more correspondents nodes 
   with identical Identifiers, additional information is required in the 
   transport layer to lookup sockets. [RFC6740] suggests using Locator 
   values to distinguish between correspondent nodes that have identical 
   Identifier value when delivering ILNP packets to applications.  

   In current Linux IP/TCP implementation, the sockets are hashed 
   globally with IP addresses and ports of both the local and remote 
   nodes. Thus, if we simply use the combination of both Identifiers and 
   Locators to lookup sockets, a large space may be required as all 
   possible local-remote Locator pairs must be taken into consideration. 
   Besides, since the lookup is performed in the transport layer, 
   Locator values are no longer transparent which violates the intention 
   of hiding Locator information from transport layer in this 
   implementation.  

   This document provides an alternative way for socket lookup in the 
   transport layer. Since using Identifier value alone is not able to 
   uniquely identify correspondent of an ILNP node, a local number 
   called Peer Index (PI) for an ILNP peer is introduced. Different from 
   Identifier, the local uniqueness of PI can be ensured. Thus the 
   transport layer is able to use the tuple

Internet-Draft    ILNPv6 Implementation Experience       November 2013 
	

   <PI_local, PI_remote, Port_local, Port_remote> 

   to uniquely identify a local socket. There are different ways to 
   generate PI and one simplest method is to use a counter which 
   increases along with the number of ILNP correspondents.  

   The bindings between PIs and other information of the correspondent 
   node (including its Identifier, Locator set, nonce, etc.) is stored 
   in a hash table in the network layer. There are two ways to get the 
   PI value of a correspondent node: use its Identifier-Locator pair and 
   Identifier-Nonce pair to lookup in the hash table. Thus the 
   disadvantage of this method is that we may have to make three lookups 
   instead of one.  

3. Handling Special Cases 

   This section discusses some special cases in implementing ILNPv6. The 
   ways to handle these cases are not described in the existing ILNP 
   specifications and in this document we propose possible methods to 
   deal with them. We believe that the issues discussed in this section 
   need to be solved not only in Linux-based ILNP implementation, but 
   also in other ways to implement the protocol.  

3.1. Having Multiple Identifiers 

   As specified in [RFC6740], one ILNP node may have multiple Identifier 
   values that are associated with it and used concurrently. One 
   scenario is that multiple virtual nodes are located on one physical 
   device.  

   This specification has impact on the implementation of the ILCC on an 
   ILNP node. [RFC6741] suggests that ILCC should contain both 
   information (Identifier values, Locator values, IL-Vectors and Nonce 
   values) of the local node and correspondent nodes but does not 
   specify the ways to organize the information. We discuss the 
   following to methods separately.  

3.1.1. A Global ILCC Table 

   A straight forward method is to maintain a global ILCC table on each 
   ILNP node. This method may work well if each ILNP node uses only one 
   Identifier value at the same time. However, having multiple 
   Identifiers but one ILCC table may lead to inconsistency and 
   conflicts.  

   Considering the scenario shown in Figure 3.1, an ILNP host H uses 
   both Identifier IH1 and IH2 to communicate with correspondent node C 
 
 
Bi, et al.               Expires May 6, 2014                  [Page 6] 
	
Internet-Draft    ILNPv6 Implementation Experience       November 2013 
	

   simultaneously. Since each Identifier represents a logical end point 
   in the network, there is no way node C can be aware that the two 
   identifiers resides in one node. Thus node C is likely to have 
   different Nonce values for each Identifier for security reasons, and 
   there is a high chance that C appears as two different nodes in node 
   H's ILCC.  

   [RFC6741] suggest using <Locator_remote, Identifier_remote> tuple as 
   the lookup key in ILCC lookups, but in this situation, the 'two 
   nodes' in H's ILCC will share exactly the same locator set. Thus H is 
   not able to distinguish the correct correspondent node for packets 
   without NONCE as they share the same <LC, IC> tuple.

          Figure 3.1: Having Multiple Identifiers on One ILNP Node

3.1.2. Independent ILCC Tables  

   Since one ILNP node could be equipped with several Identifiers, it is 
   natural to set up an ILCC table for each one of them. Independent 
   ILCC tables avoid the potential conflicts by using local information 
   (Identifier_local and Locator_local) in ILNP packets when performing 
   ILCC lookups. Another reason to choose Independent ILCC tables is 
   that a global ILCC would cost as much memory as independent ones when 
   processing the same number of possible Locator Update messages.  

   One possible implementation of independent ILCC tables is shown in 
   Figure 3.2. First we introduce Association as a data structure that 
   stores information of an ILNP-based network-layer session (PI, 
   Identifiers, Locators and Nonces of both local and remote nodes). We 
   call each independent ILCC table a Cache which stores the 
   Associations of all remote nodes that correspondent to a local 
   Identifier. Finally all Caches constitute the local ILCC table.

   When looking up in the ILCC, the local Identifier is firstly used as 
   the key to find a corresponding Cache. Then both Identifier_remote-
   Locator_remote pair and Identifier_remote-Nonce_remote pair can be 
   used as key to find an Association.

3.2. Missing Nonce Values 

   In the initial phase of a session between two ILNP nodes, it is 
   possible that one side does not know the Nonce value generated by the 
   other side for the session (for example, when no packet is sent from 
   the other side).  

   This case has impact on the ILCC lookup rules. [RFC6741] specifies 
   that when looking up into the ILCC, <Identifier_remote, Nonce_remote> 
   tuple MUST be used as the lookup key if Nonce Option in contained in 
   the packet. Otherwise, <Identifier_remote, Locator_remote> tuple MUST 
   be used as the lookup key. However, for the packet from a remote node 
   whose Nonce value is unknown to the local node, the lookup rule MUST 
   be changed to:  

   1. Drop any received packet without Nonce Option, since [RFC6744] 
   specifies that initial packet(s) to correspondent ILNP nodes MUST 
   include Nonce Option. 

   2. For received packet with a Nonce Option, store the Nonce value in 
   local ILCC and deliver the packet normally.  

   After the Nonce value is acquired from the remote node, follow-up 
   packets from the remote node MUST be processed using the normal 
   lookup rule.

3.2.1. Avoid Both Identical Identifiers and Nonces 

   A special case in handling missing Nonce values is shown in Figure 
   3.3 where Host H is communicating with two correspondent nodes C1 and 
   C2 with identical Identifiers. In this case, H has an on-going 
   session with C1 while is initiating another session with C2 and has 
   not yet get Nonce from it.  

                             ...... 
                            .      .      +------------------+ 
                           .        .     | Correspondent C1 | 
                          .          .----| ID IC            | 
          +--------+      .          .    | Locator LC1      | 
          |        |      .          .    +------------------+ 
          | Host H |------. Internet .                         
          |        |      .          .    +------------------+ 
          +--------+      .          .    | Correspondent C2 | 
                           .        .-----| ID IC            | 
                            .      .      | Locator LC2      | 
                             ......       +------------------+ 

      Figure 3.3: A Special Case in Dealing with Missing Nonce Values 

   If the Nonce value generated by C2 happens to be the same to the 
   Nonce of C1 which is stored in H's ILCC, C1 and C2 will share both 
   the same Identifier and Nonce. This situation MUST be avoided because 
   it makes C1 and C2 undistinguishable when their Locators change.  

   One way to handle the special case is to send an ICMP error message 
   to C2 if it generates the same Nonce as C1. After receiving the ICMP 
   error message, C2 should re-generate another Nonce value. 
   Consequently, the lookup rule in this case is changed to:  

   1. Drop any received packet without Nonce Option. 

   2. For received packet with a Nonce Option, lookup into the ILCC 
   using <Identifier_remote, Nonce_remote> as the key. If no entry is 
   found, store the Nonce value in local ILCC and deliver the packet 
   normally. Otherwise send an ICMP error message to the remote node 
   indicated by <Identifier_remote, Locator_remote>.  

   Considering the scenario in Figure 3.3, there is another method to 
   prevent C2 from generating the same Nonce value as C1: when 
   initiating a session with C2, H informs C2 of the Nonce generated by 
   C1, thus C2 can avoid generating the same value. However,

   modifications to session establishment process is required using this 
   method.

   We suggest introducing a path selection subsystem into ILNP for 
   better performance, especially for a multi-homing node. This 
   subsystem maintains the best Locator pairs of the local node and its 
   correspondent node based on user-defined policy or other criteria 
   such as longest matching prefixes. These maintained Locator pairs can 
   be used to accelerate the process of selecting Locators when 
   transmitting ILNP packets.  

   This subsystem MUST respond to basic ICMP messages that have an 
   impact on the status of Locators, like Locator Update or Router 
   Advertisement. Also, it COULD gather information from 
   incoming/outgoing packets to enable features like load balancing. 

4.2. SBR Extension 

   We also suggest an extension based on ILNP-capable Site Border Router 
   (SBR) to reduce the overhead due to propagation and processing of 
   Locator Update messages. Since [RFC6748] has already described to 
   realize localized numbering using ILNP-capable SBR, we further 
   utilize it to localize Locator Update in some scenarios.  

   Considering the scenario in Figure 4.1, a site network with SBR and 
   Locator value L_1 is divided into two sub networks, e.g. sub network 
   1 with local Locator value L_La and sub network 2 with local Locator 
   value L_Lb. When a Mobile Node (MN) moves from sub network 1 to sub 
   network 2, according to the specifications in [RFC6748], the MN needs 
   to change both its Global Locator L_1 and local Locator L_L. 
   Therefore, even if the MN is roaming within a site network using 
   localized numbering, correspondent nodes (CN) need to be aware of 
   Locator changes of the MN.  

   We propose an alternative way to handle intra-site network mobility 
   by keeping Global Locator of the MN unchanged when it moves among 
   different sub networks within the same site network. In scenario 
   shown in Figure 4.1, CN always learns the IL-Vector of MN as [I_H, 
   L_1]. When packets destined to the MN arrive at the SBR, it rewrites 
   the Locator part of each packet to a local Locator value (L_La or 
   L_Lb in this example). During this process, SBR functions similarly 
   to the Locator Rewriting Relay (LRR) proposed in [RFC6748], but LRR 
   is introduced only for Location privacy issues.

     Figure 4.1: Utilize ILNP-capable SBR to localize Locator Update 

   To decide which local Locator should be used, SBR needs to maintain a 
   mapping table locally which stores mappings from Identifier and 
   global Locator values of the MN to its current local Locator value. 
   An example of the mapping table for SBR in Figure 4.1 has the 
   following form:  

     src=[I_H, L_La], L_1                                       ---4(a) 
     dst=[I_H, L_1],  L_La                                      ---4(b) 

   Expression 4(a) says that for packets with src IL-V [I_H, L_La], its 
   source Locator should be rewritten to L_1. Similarly, expression 4(b) 
   says for packets with dst IL-V [I_H, L_1], its destination Locator 
   should be rewritten to L_La. After the MN moves to another sub 
   network within the same site network and changes its local Locator 
   value, the MN is responsible to inform the SBR of its new local

   Locator value using Locator Update message. Therefore, instead of 
   sending a Locator Update message to each CN, the MN only needs to 
   send one Locator Update message to the SBR in this scenario, which 
   reduces propagation and processing cost of Locator Update messages.
