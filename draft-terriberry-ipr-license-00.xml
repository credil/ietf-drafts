<abstract>
<t>
This draft gives provides an example set of licensing terms for use in IPR
 disclosures that are compatible with the goals of the proposed video-codec
 working group for further discussion and refinement by participants at the
 IETF.
Although usage of such a license is strictly voluntary, the hope is that
 getting agreement on a set of terms before the bulk of the work begins will
 allow contributors to use a common license and minimize the amount of legal
 analysis that must be performed in order to deploy the codec.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
The goal of this license, using the words of the
 <eref target="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/video-codec/current/msg00128.html">current
 video-codec charter</eref>, is to allow the contribution of IPR to a standard
 which "can be widely implemented and easily distributed among application
 developers, service operators, and end users.
The objective is to produce a codec that can be implemented, distributed, and
 deployed by open source and closed source software and hardware vendors,
 without the need to request a license, enter into a business agreement, pay
 licensing fees or royalties, or attempt to adhere to other onerous conditions
 or restrictions."
</t>
<t>
This goal, particularly the compatibility with open-source licenses, precludes
 many forms of normal IPR licensing, including the requirement for each
 licensor to explicitly request a license or perform some overt act to activate
 a license.
The terms here also attempt to provide some amount of safety to those
 implementing standard from others also implementing the same standard, through
 the use of a defensive termination clause.
</t>
<t>
Although this license is designed specifically for use with the video-codec
 effort, the terms have been kept generic enough to allow it to be used
 elsewhere.

<section anchor="license-grant" title="License Grant">
<t>
___________ ("Licensor") hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in the "Termination"
section below) license to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
otherwise transfer any Implementation or portion thereof, under all Necessary
Claims of Licensor (the "License").
</t>

<section anchor="definitions" title="Definitions">
<t>
"Original Specification" means draft-ietf-_______________.
</t>
<t>
"Reference Implementation" means the implementation of the Original
Specification made publicly available at ______________.
</t>
<t>
"Specification" means the Original Specification or, at your option, any future
update or new version of that specification issued as an RFC (Request for
Comments) by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).
</t>
<t>
"Implementation" means any implementation (including the Reference
 Implementation) that complies fully with all non-optional portions of the
 Specification.
</t>
<t>
"Licensee" means any party that has received the License, provided the License
 to such party has not been terminated under the "Termination" section below.
</t>
<t>
"Necessary Claims" of a party means all claims of patents or patent applications
 that, (a) currently or at any time in the future, (i) are owned or controlled
 by such party or its Affiliates, or (ii) for which such party or its
 Affiliates has the authority to grant the License without the requirement to
 pay a royalty to any party other than an Affiliate, and (b) (i) for which
 there is no commercially viable means of implementing the Original
 Specification, including any optional portion thereof, without infringing such
 claims; or (ii) are infringed by the use of the Reference Implementation.
</t>
<t>
"Affiliate" is any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with a party.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="termination" title="Termination">
<t>
If you, directly or indirectly, including via an Affiliate, subsidiary, agent,
or exclusive licensee, (a) file an action for infringement of a Necessary
Claim, or (b) make any other written claim of infringement of a Necessary
Claim, against any Licensee alleging that any Implementation, in whole or in
part, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of
patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you and your Affiliates
under this License shall automatically terminate retroactively as of the date
you first received the License.

<section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion">
<section anchor="scope" title="Scope of the Grant">
<t>
The scope of the grant is defined by two pieces: a specific draft (the
 "Original Specification") and a specific implementation (the "Reference
 Implementation").
The idea is to cover both the algorithms and methods that are required for
 interoperability (e.g., for a video codec, the decoder specification), plus at
 least one set of algorithms and methods which can produce a useful
 implementation (such as an encoder, packet loss concealment (PLC) in the
 decoder, etc.).
Although people may still compete on making more optimized decoders, better
 encoders or better PLC, they are guaranteed that use of the reference
 implementation, at least, is safe.
</t>
<t>
The "Original Specification" and "Reference Implementation" which define the
 scope of the grant are also kept separate from the "Specification" and
 "Implementation" which define how the licensed claims may be used.
This allows change control over what the standard says to remain with the IETF,
 while ensuring that the scope of the grant is not open-ended, so parties
 contributing their IPR know what they are giving.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="discus-termination" title="Termination">
<t>
The termination clause protects a Licensee from infringement claims by other
 Licensees.
Any Licensee that tries to assert patent claims against another Licensee will
 lose their own license, and find themselves exposed to potential lawsuits from
 all other Licensees.
This is designed to minimize defections after the standard is deployed.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="open-issues" title="Open Issues">
<section anchor="a-reciprocity-clause" title="A Reciprocity Clause">
<t>
The license currently does not define a "reciprocity clause", wherein Licensees
 give other Licensees an explicit license back to any IPR they might own.
Instead it relies on the termination clause to achieve a similar, though not
 identical effect.
Reciprocity clauses have become more normal in recent patent licenses, and it
 may be worth adding one here.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="defensive-suspension" title="Defensive Suspension">
<t>
We have received some early feedback that our defensive termination clause may
 be too strong to qualify as RAND.
Another alternative is defensive suspension, wherein parties simply agree not
 to enforce their patents unless they themselves are sued.
We are still studying this issue.
