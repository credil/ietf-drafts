        Registration of Second-Level URI Namespaces Under "ietf"
                  draft-leiba-urnbis-ietf-namespace-00

Abstract

   RFC 2648 defines the "ietf" URN namespace, and defines a number of
   sub-namespaces.  RFC 3553 defines an additional sub-namespace,
   "params", and creates a registry to document allocations under that.
   But there is no registry that lists, in one place, all sub-namespaces
   of "ietf".  This document creates and populates such a registry.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

1.  Introduction

   "A URN Namespace for IETF Documents" [RFC2648] defines the "ietf" URN
   namespace, and defines a number of sub-namespaces.  "An IETF URN Sub-
   namespace for Registered Protocol Parameters" [RFC3553] defines an
   additional sub-namespace, "params", and creates a registry to
   document allocations under that.  But there is no registry that
   lists, in one place, all sub-namespaces of "ietf".  This document
   creates and populates such a registry, and updates RFC 2648 and RFC
   3553 to refer readers of those documents to this registry.


2.  IANA Considerations

   There is currently a top-level registry group called "IETF Protocol
   Parameter Identifiers", which contains one registry, "IETF URN Sub-
   namespace for Registered Protocol Parameters".  IANA is asked to take
   the following three actions:

   Action 1: Rename the group "IETF Protocol Parameter Identifiers",
   giving it the new name "Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for
   IETF Use".  The existing registry in that group will remain, and its
   name will be unchanged.

   Action 2: Add a new registry to the renamed group.  The new registry
   will be called "IETF URN Sub-namespaces", and new registrations will
   use the IETF Review policy [RFC5226], which provides for IETF
   consensus in order to add a new URN namespace under "ietf".

   Action 3: Populate the new registry as follows:
