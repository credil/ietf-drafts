INTERNET DRAFT   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-segment-route    June 17, 2011


1  Introduction

   [E-VPN] defines a solution and architecture for BGP MPLS-based
   Ethernet L2VPN services with advanced multi-homing capabilities. To
   that end, [E-VPN] defines a new BGP NLRI with 5 route types:

        1. Ethernet Auto-Discovery (A-D) route
        2. MAC advertisement route
        3. Inclusive Multicast Route
        5. Selective Multicast Auto-Discovery (A-D) Route
        6. Leaf Auto-Discovery (A-D) Route

   In this draft, we define one additional route type:

        4. Ethernet Segment Route

   This route primarily enhances the multi-homing capabilities of the E-
   VPN solution in the following areas:

       - Preventing transient loops and packet duplication
       - Support of multi-chassis Ethernet bundles
       - Designated Forwarder election with VLAN carving
       - Avoiding relearning of subscriber/session state 

   In addition to the above route, 3 new BGP route attributes are
   defined: the ESI Import Extended Community attribute, the DF Election
   attribute and the Inter-chassis Communication attribute.

   Section 2 discusses the motivation and usage of the new route and
   attributes. Section 3 describes the BGP encoding.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Motivation and Usage

   This section focuses on the reasons for defining the Ethernet Segment
   route and its associated 3 BGP attributes, and describes its usage in
   E-VPN.

2.1  Preventing Transient Loops and Packet Duplication

   The Designated Forwarder (DF) election procedures defined in [E-VPN]
   require that each MES constructs a candidate list of DFs from the
   received Ethernet A-D routes. By default, each MES then independently

   chooses the MES with the highest IP address as the elected DF. There
   is no handshake mechanism between the MESes that are connected to the
   same Ethernet Segment. As a result of that, during routing
   transients, different MESes may end up electing different DFs for the
   same Ethernet Segment due to inconsistent views of the network. If
   the Ethernet Segment is a multi-homed device, this may lead to
   transient packet duplication. If the Ethernet Segment is a multi-
   homed network, the presence of multiple DFs may lead to transient
   forwarding loops in addition to potential packet duplication.

   To eliminate these issues, a handshake mechanism is required between
   the MES nodes connected to the same Ethernet Segment, to ensure a
   common view of the network among them. This handshake is performed
   using the DF Election attribute carried in the Ethernet Segment
   route, as discussed in the 'DF Election with Paxos Algorithm'
   section.

2.2  Support of Multi-Chassis Ethernet Bundles

   When a CE is multi-homed to a set of MES nodes using the [802.1AX]
   Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), the MESes must act as if
   they were a single LACP speaker for the Ethernet links to form a
   bundle, and operate correctly as a Link Aggregation Group (LAG). To
   achieve this, the MESes connected to the same multi-homed CE must
   synchronize LACP configuration and operational data among them. The
   synchronization is required for the following reasons:

   - to determine if the links in the Ethernet bundle are to operate in
   all-active or hot-standby resiliency mode

   - to detect and handle CE mis-configuration when LACP Port Key is
   configured on the MES

   - to detect and handle mis-wiring between CE and MES when LACP Port
   Key is configured on the MES

   - to deterministically agree on which link(s) should join a bundle
   based on port and system priorities, especially when the number of
   links exceeds the aggregation capacity of the MESes, and the MES LACP
   System Priority is higher than the CE's

   - to detect and react to actor/partner churn where the LACP speakers
   are not able to converge 

   Synchronization of LACP state between MESes is performed using the
   Inter-chassis Communication attribute carried in the Ethernet Segment
   route, as described in the 'LACP State Synchronization' section
   below.

2.3  Designated Forwarder (DF) Election with VLAN Carving

   In the case where multiple MES nodes offer redundant connectivity for
   an Ethernet Segment, it is preferred to elect multiple DFs (one DF
   per VLAN) in order to distribute the traffic among the redundancy
   group members. This process of electing different DFs for different
   VLANs on an Ethernet Segment, for purpose of load-balancing, is
   referred to as 'VLAN Carving'. 

   The VLAN carving algorithm must ensure even distribution of VLANs
   among the MES nodes servicing the same Ethernet Segment. As new MES
   devices get commissioned or decommissioned, the VLANs must be
   redistributed over the available devices for even load-balancing.
   However, in the case of link, port or node failure, the VLAN carving
   algorithm should ensure that only the affected VLANs are reassigned
   to different MES(es), and none of the other active VLANs are
   shuffled. Otherwise, the fault decoupling capability of the
   redundancy group would be compromised. 

   VLAN carving requires exchange of information among the MES nodes
   connected to an Ethernet Segment in order to agree upon how the VLANs
   will be distributed. Since this information is only relevant to the
   MES nodes that are directly connected to a specific Ethernet Segment,
   the exchanges and associated processing should be localized to the
   redundancy group members. 

   DF Election with VLAN carving is performed using the DF Election
   attribute carried in the Ethernet Segment route, as described in the
   "VLAN Carving" section below.

2.4 Route Scalability with Granular DF Election

   [E-VPN] allows for DF election to be performed at the granularity of
   either an Ethernet Segment or combination of Ethernet Segment and
   VLAN on that segment. In the latter case, an Ethernet A-D route per
   (ESI, VLAN) must be advertised by the MES regardless of whether the
   service interface is port-based, VLAN-based, VLAN bundling-based or
   VLAN aware bundling-based. In case of port-based and VLAN bundling-
   based services, these routes are only required for DF election and
   not for advertising forwarding labels. By using the Ethernet Segment
   route instead of the Ethernet A-D route for DF election, it is still
   possible to have per-VLAN DF granularity while significantly reducing
   the number of BGP routes advertised. For e.g., consider an Ethernet
   Segment ESI1 used for a port-based service. By using the Ethernet A-D
   route for per (ESI, VLAN) DF election, 4095 routes are needed.
   Whereas, using the Ethernet Segment route, only a single route is
   required.

2.5 Avoiding Relearning of Subscriber/Session State

   For certain applications, the MES builds and maintains per subscriber
   or per session 'soft' state that is used for either optimizing the
   traffic forwarding or enforcing security. Examples of such per
   subscriber/session state includes:

   - multicast state derived from IGMP or PIM snooping

   - IP address to MAC address bindings gleaned from snooping ARP and/or
   DHCP packets, and used to prevent address spoofing or masquerading

   When a set of MES nodes provides multi-homed connectivity for an
   Ethernet Segment, this 'soft' state is built on the active MES node
   that forwards and snoops the relevant protocol packets. In case of a
   link or node failure, the state must be reconstructed on the backup
   MES (e.g. by waiting for the next IGMP query or ARP message or by
   issuing unsolicited queries). This may cause traffic disruption and
   affect the availability of the service. Alternatively, the state can
   be synchronized among the MES nodes via BGP, and that would enhance
   the convergence of the service after failure.

   Synchronization of subscriber/session state between MES nodes is
   performed using the Inter-chassis Communication attribute carried in
   the Ethernet Segment route, as described in the 'Subscriber/Session
   State Synchronization' section below.


3  BGP Encoding

   This section defines the encoding of the BGP route and attributes.

3.1 Ethernet Segment Route

   The Ethernet Segment Route is encoded in the E-VPN NLRI defined in
   [E-VPN] using the Route Type value of 4. The Route Type Specific
   field of the NLRI is formatted as follows:

3.2 ES-Import Extended Community

   This is a new transitive extended community carried with the Ethernet
   Segment route. When used, it enables all the MESes connected to the

4  DF Election with Paxos Algorithm

   The procedures in this section guarantee that all MES nodes in a
   given redundancy group agree on a unique DF for a given Ethernet
   Segment. This eliminates the problem of transient forwarding loops
   and transient packet duplicates described above. The procedures can
   be broken down to the following steps:

   1. When a MES discovers the ESI of the attached Ethernet Segment, it
   advertises an Ethernet Segment route with the associated ES-Import
   extended community attribute and with the 'Initializing' code in the
   State field of the DF Election attribute. 

   2. The MES then starts a timer to allow the reception of Ethernet
   Segment routes from other MES nodes in the same redundancy group.

   3. When the timer expires, each MES builds an ordered list of the IP
   addresses of all the MES nodes connected to the Ethernet Segment
   (including itself), in increasing numeric value. 

   4. The first MES in the ordered list then elects itself as the
   Arbiter Node (AN). It initiates the handshake by sending an Ethernet
   Segment route with 'Proposal Pending' code in the State field of the
   DF Election attribute. 

   5. When a MES node receives an Ethernet Segment route with the
   'Proposal Pending' code, it takes one of the following options:

      a. If the receiving MES ranks the transmitting MES's IP address as
      the top entry in its local ordered list, it acknowledges the
      handshake by responding with an Ethernet Segment route with the
      'Promise Pending' code in the State field of the DF Election
      attribute. This includes the scenario where the receiving MES
      forfeits the AN role to another advertising MES with a numerically
      lower IP address.

      b. If the receiving MES does not rank the transmitting MES's IP
      address as the top entry in its local ordered list, and the
      receiving MES had advertised an Ethernet Segment route with the
      'Initializing' code or with the 'Proposal Pending' code, then the
      MES takes no further action.

INTERNET DRAFT   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-segment-route    June 17, 2011


   6. When the AN receives 'Promise Pending' from all of the MES nodes
   in the ordered list, it sends an updated Ethernet Segment route with
   the 'Active' code in the DF Election attribute. 

   7. When the other MES nodes in the redundancy group receive the
   'Active' code from the AN, they respond with an updated Ethernet
   Segment route with the 'Active' code in the DF Election attribute.
   This concludes the handshake.

   In the case where the DF election is performed at the granularity of
   an Ethernet Segment, i.e. there is a single DF for all VLANs on the
   segment, the Arbiter Node is effectively the Designated Forwarder for
   the segment. All the MES nodes start off with their ports, that are
   connected to the segment, blocked in Step 1 (for multi-destination
   traffic from core). And in Step 6, the MES confirmed as the AN (i.e.
   DF) unblocks its port towards the Ethernet Segment. DF election at
   the granularity of (Ethernet Segment, VLAN) is discussed in the "VLAN
   Carving" section below.

5  LACP State Synchronization

   To support CE multi-homing with multi-chassis Ethernet bundles, the
   MES nodes connected to a given CE should synchronize [802.1AX] LACP
   state amongst each other. This includes the following LACP specific
   configuration parameters:

   - System Identifier (MAC Address): uniquely identifies a LACP
   speaker.
   - System Priority: determines which LACP speaker's port priorities
   are used in the Selection logic.
   - Aggregator Identifier: uniquely identifies a bundle within a LACP
   speaker.
   - Aggregator MAC Address: identifies the MAC address of the bundle.
   - Aggregator Key: used to determine which ports can join an
   Aggregator.
   - Port Number: uniquely identifies an interface within a LACP
   speaker.
   - Port Key: determines the set of ports that can be bundled.
   - Port Priority: determines a port's precedence level to join a
   bundle in case the number of eligible ports exceeds the maximum
   number of links allowed in a bundle.

   The above information must be synchronized between the MES nodes
   wishing to form a multi-chassis bundle with a given CE, in order for
   the former to convey a single LACP peer to that CE. This is required
   for initial system bring-up and upon any configuration change.
   Furthermore, the MESes must also synchronize operational (run-time)
   data, in order for the LACP Selection logic state-machines to
 


Sajassi et al.         Expires December 19, 2011                [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT   draft-sajassi-l2vpn-evpn-segment-route    June 17, 2011


   execute. This operational data includes the following LACP
   operational parameters, on a per port basis:

   - Partner System Identifier: this is the CE System MAC address.
   - Partner System Priority: the CE LACP System Priority
   - Partner Port Number: CE's AC port number.
   - Partner Port Priority: CE's AC Port Priority.
   - Partner Key: CE's key for this AC.
   - Partner State: CE's LACP State for the AC.
   - Actor State: PE's LACP State for the AC.
   - Port State: PE's AC port status.

   The above state needs to be communicated between MESes forming a
   multi-chassis bundle during LACP initial bring-up, upon any
   configuration change and upon the occurrence of a failure.

   It should be noted that the above configuration and operational state
   is localized in scope and is only relevant to PEs within a given
   Redundancy Group, i.e. which connect to the same Ethernet Segment
   over a given Ethernet bundle. Furthermore, the communication of state
   changes, upon failures, must occur with minimal latency, in order to
   minimize the switchover time and consequent service disruption.

   Without synchronization of the above parameters, the system is
   subject to the issues outlined in section 2.2 above.

6  VLAN Carving

   It is possible to elect multiple DFs per Ethernet Segment (one per
   VLAN) by using a slightly modified version of the procedures
   described in the "DF Election with Paxos Algorithm" section above.

   In step 3, each of the MES nodes assigns an ordinal for itself based
   on the order of its IP address in the list. The first MES in the list
   (the one with the numerically lowest IP address) is given an ordinal
   of 0. The ordinals are used to determine which MES node will be the
   DF for a given VLAN on the Ethernet Segment using the following
   rule:

   Assuming a redundancy group of N MES nodes, the MES with ordinal i is
   the DF for VLAN V when (V MOD N) = i.

   In step 6, the AN unblocks only the VLANs for which it is a DF for
   the Ethernet Segment. 

   In step 7, each MES node unblocks only the VLANs for which it is a DF
   for the Ethernet Segment.

   In the case of a port, link or node failure, the AN takes over the
   forwarding for the affected VLANs on the segment and advertises an
   updated Ethernet Segment route with the 'Active' code and
   'Protecting' flag set in the DF Election attribute. Therefore, when
   VLAN carving is used, the AN acts as the Backup DF (BDF) for the
   Ethernet Segment. This ensures that only the affected VLANs are
   failed over, and none of the other VLANs are shuffled. 

   When the fault clears, the following procedure is followed to revert
   the VLANs to the recovering MES:

   1. The recovering MES advertises an Ethernet Segment route with the
   'Initializing' code in the State field of the DF Election attribute. 

   2. The recovering MES receives from the other MES nodes Ethernet
   Segment routes with the 'Active' code in the DF Election attribute.
   The MES can, then, build its ordered list.

   3. The recovering MES advertises an Ethernet Segment route with the
   'Proposal-Pending' code in the DF Election attribute. This is meant
   to indicate to the AN that the recovering MES is ready to take over
   its VLANs.

   4. Upon receiving the route with the 'Proposal Pending' code, the AN
   blocks all the VLANs that belong to the recovering MES. The AN then
   advertises an updated Ethernet Segment route with the 'Protecting'
   flag cleared.

   5. Upon receiving the above route from the AN, the recovering MES
   unblocks the VLANs for which it is the DF. The recovering MES then
   transmits an Ethernet Segment route with the 'Active' code. This
   completes the reversion.

   If the failed MES is the AN, then the MES node with the second best
   claim to be AN (i.e. whose IP address is the second in the ordered
   list) takes over the failed VLANs and advertises an updated Ethernet
   Segment route with the 'Active' code and 'Protecting' flag set in the
   DF Election attribute. The procedures for reversion, in this case,
   are as follows: 

   1. The recovering AN advertises an Ethernet Segment route with the
   'Initializing' code in the State field of the DF Election attribute. 

   2. The recovering AN receives from the other MES nodes Ethernet
   Segment routes with the 'Active' code in the DF Election attribute.

   3. The recovering AN advertises an Ethernet Segment route with the
   'Proposal-Pending' code in the DF Election attribute.

   4. The other MES nodes respond to that advertisement with Ethernet
   Segment routes with the 'Promise-Pending' code in the DF Election
   attribute. At this point, the BDF blocks all the VLANs that belong to
   the recovering AN before advertising its Ethernet Segment route, with
   the 'Promise-Pending' code and 'Protecting' flag cleared. 

   5. The recovering AN unblocks the VLANs for which it is the DF upon
   receiving the 'Promise-Pending' advertisements from the BDF. The AN
   then advertises an Ethernet Segment route with the 'Active' code once
   it receives the Ethernet Segment route with 'Promise-Pending' code
   from all of the MES nodes in the redundancy group.

   6. The other MES nodes respond with Ethernet Segment routes with the
   'Active' code. This marks the end of the reversion.

7  Subscriber/Session State Synchronization

   Synchronization of subscriber/session state between MES nodes is
   performed using the Inter-chassis Communication attribute carried in
   the Ethernet Segment route. The various applications are responsible
   for the encoding and decoding of the relevant data, and this is
   outside the scope of this draft. BGP provides a reliable transport
   service in this case.

8  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security aspects beyond those of VPLS/H-VPLS
   that need to be considered.


9  IANA Considerations

   To be added in a later revision.
