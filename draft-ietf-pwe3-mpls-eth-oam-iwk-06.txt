     2. Introduction 

      
     This document specifies the mapping of defect states between 
     Ethernet Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet 
     Pseudowires (PWs) connected in accordance to the PWE3 architecture 
     [RFC3985] to realize an end-to-end emulated Ethernet service. This 
     document augments the mapping of defect states between a PW and 
     associated AC of the end-to-end emulated service in [RFC6310]. It 
     covers the following Ethernet OAM (Opertaions, Administration and 
     Maintenance) mechanisms and their interworking with PW OAM 
     mechanisms:  
               
          - Ethernet Continuity Check (CC) [802.1ag][Y.1731]  
          - Ethernet Alarm Indication Signaling (AIS) and Remote Defect  
            Indication (RDI) [Y.1731]  
          - Ethernet Link OAM [802.3]  
          - Ethernet Local Management Interface {E-LMI} [MEF16]  
               
     Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] allows some Link defect states to be 
     detected and communicated across an Ethernet Link. When an Ethernet

     Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-eth-oam-iwk-06   July 2012 
         

     AC is an Ethernet physical port, there may be some application of 
     Ethernet Link OAM [802.3]. Further, E-LMI [MEF16] also allows for 
     some Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC) defect states to be 
     communicated across an Ethernet UNI where Ethernet UNI constitutes 
     a single hop Ethernet Link (i.e. without any 802.1Q/.1ad compliant 
     bridges in between). There may be some application of E-LMI [MEF16] 
     for failure notification across single hop Ethernet AC in certain 
     deployments that specifically do not support [802.1ag] and/or 
     [Y.1731]. [Y.1731] and [802.1ag] based mechanisms are applicable in 
     all types of Ethernet ACs. Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] and E-LMI 
     [MEF16] are optional and their applicability is called out, where 
     applicable. 
      
     Native Service (NS) OAM may be transported transparently over the 
     corresponding PW as user data. This is referred to as "the single 
     emulated OAM loop" mode per [RFC6310]. For Ethernet, as an example, 
     802.1ag continuity check messages (CCMs) between two Maintenance 
     End Points (MEPs) can be transported transparently as user data 
     over the corresponding PW. At MEP locations, service failure is 
     detected when CCMs are not received over an interval that is 3.5 
     times the local CCM transmission interval. This is one of the 
     failure conditions detected via CC. MEP peers can exist between 
     Customer Equipment (CE) pairs (MEPs of a given Maintenance Entity 
     Group (MEG) reside on the CEs), PE pairs (the MEPs of a given MEG 
     reside on the PEs), or between the CE and PE (the MEPs of a given 
     MEG reside on the PE and CE), as long as the MEG domain nesting 
     rules are maintained. It should be noted that Ethernet allows the 
     definition of up to 8 MEG domains, each compromising of MEPs (down 
     MEPs and UP MEPs) and Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs). These 
     domains can be nested or touching. MEPs and MIPs generate and 
     process messages in the same domain level. Thus, whenever in this 
     document we refer to messages sent by a MEP or a MIP to a peer MEP 
     or MIP, these MEPs and MIPs are in the same MEG domain level. 
      
     When interworking two networking domains, such as native Ethernet 
     and PWs to provide an end-to-end emulated service, there is need to 
     identify the failure domain and location even when a PE supports 
     both the NS OAM mechanisms and the PW OAM mechanisms. In addition, 
     scalability constraints may not allow running proactive monitoring, 
     such as CCMs with transmission enabled, at a PE to detect the 
     failure of an EVC across the PW domain. Thus, network-driven alarms 
     generated upon failure detection in the NS or PW domain and their 
     mappings to the other domain are needed. There are also cases where 
     a PE may not be able to process NS OAM messages received on the PW 
     even when such messages are defined, as in Ethernet case, 
     necessitating the need for fault notification message mapping 
     between the PW domain and the NS domain.

     For Multi-Segment PWs (MS-PWs) [RFC5659], Switching PEs (S-PEs) are 
     not aware of the NS. Thus, failure detection and notification at S-
     PEs will be based on PW OAM mechanisms. Mapping between PW OAM and 
     NS OAM will be required at the Terminating PEs (T-PEs) to propagate 
     the failure notification to the EVC endpoints. 
      
     Similar to [RFC6310], the intent of this document is to standardize 
     the behavior of PEs with respect to failures on Ethernet ACs and 
     PWs, so that there is no ambiguity about the alarms generated and 
     consequent actions undertaken by PEs in response to specific 
     failure conditions. 
      
     2.1. Reference Model and Defect Locations 

      

     Figure 1 is the same as used in [RFC6310] and is reproduced in this 
     document as a reference to highlight defect locations.

     2.2.  Abstract Defect States 

      

     Abstract Defect States are also introduced in [RFC6310]. This 
     document uses the same conventions, as shown in Figure 2, from 
     [RFC6310]. It may be noted however that CE devices, shown in Figure 
     2, do not necessarily have to be end customer devices. These are 
     essentially devices in client network segments that are connecting 
     to the Packet Switched Network (PSN) for the emulated services.

         Figure 2: Transmit and Receive Defect States and Notifications  
      

     PE1 may detect a receive defect in a local Ethernet AC via one of 
     the following mechanisms: 

      

         - An AIS alarm generated at an upstream node in the client 
     domain (CE1 in Figure 2) and received by a local MEP.  

      

         - Failure of the local link on which the AC is configured. Link 
     failure may be detected via physical failures (e.g., loss of signal 
     (LoS)), via Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] critical link event 
     notifications generated at an upstream node CE1 with "Dying Gasp" 
     or "Critical Event" indication, or via a client Signal Fail message 
     [Y.1731].  

      

        - Failure to receive CCMs on the AC if a local MEP is configured 
     for the AC with CCM transmission enabled.  

      

        - A CCM from CE1 with interface status TLV indicating interface 
     down. Other CCM interface status TLVs will not be used to indicate 
     failure or recovery from failure.   

      

     It should be noted when a MEP at a PE or a CE receives a CCM with 
     the wrong MEG ID, MEP ID, or MEP level, the receiving PE or CE

     SHOULD treat such an event as an AC receive defect. In any case, if 
     such events persist for 3.5 times the MEP local CCM transmission 
     time, loss of continuity will be declared at the receiving end.    

     An AC receive defect at PE1 impacts the ability of PE1 to receive 
     user traffic from the Client domain attached to PE1 via that AC.  

      

     PE1 may detect a receive defect in the PW via one of the following 
     mechanisms:  

         

       - A Forward Defect notification received from PE2. This defect 
     notification could point to problems associated with PE2's 
     inability to transmit traffic on the PW or PE2's inability to 
     receive traffic on its local AC from CE2.  

       - Unavailability of a PSN path in the PW domain to PE2. 

       

     A PW forward defect indication received on PE1 impacts the ability 
     of PE1 to receive traffic on the PW. 

      

     PE1 may be notified of an AC transmit defect via one of the 
     following mechanisms:  

      

           - CCMs with RDI (Remote Defect Indication) bit set.  

      

           - In case when the AC is associated with a physical port, 
     failure of the local link on which the AC is configured (e.g., LOS 
     or via Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] critical link event notifications 
     generated at an upstream node CE1 with "Link Fault" indication).  

      

     An AC transmit defect impacts the ability of PE1 to send user 
     traffic on the local AC.

     Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-eth-oam-iwk-06   July 2012 
         

      

     Similarly, PE1 may be notified of a PW transmit defect via Reverse 
     Defect indication from PE2, which could point to problems 
     associated with PE2's inability to receive traffic on the PW or 
     PE2's inability to transmit traffic on its local AC.  

      

     PW transmit defect impacts PE1 ability to send user traffic toward 
     CE2. The procedures outlined in this document define the entry and 
     exit criteria for each of the four defect states with respect to 
     Ethernet ACs and corresponding PWs, and the consequent actions that 
     PE1 must support to properly interwork these defect states and 
     corresponding notification messages between the PW domain and the 
     Native Service (NS) domain. Receive Defect state SHOULD have 
     precedence over Transmit Defect state in terms of handling, when 
     both transmit and receive defect states are identified 
     simultaneously. 

      

     3. Terminology 

     This document uses the following terms:  

        - AIS:       Alarm Indication Signal 

          

        - MD Level:  Maintenance Domain (MD) Level which identifies a 
        value in the range of 0-7 associated with Ethernet OAM frame. 
        MD Level identifies the span of the Ethernet OAM frame. 

         

         - MEP:     Maintenance End Point is responsible for 
        origination and termination of OAM frames for a given MEG.  

         

         - MIP:     Maintenance Intermediate Point is located between 
        peer MEPs and can process OAM frames but does not initiate or 
        terminate them.

         - RDI:      Remote Defect Indication.  

         

     Further, this document also uses the terminology and conventions 
     used in [RFC6310]. 

      
     4. PW Status and Defects  

      
     [RFC6310] introduces a range of defects that impact PW status. All 
     these defect conditions are applicable for Ethernet PWs.  
                
     Similarly, there are different mechanisms described in [RFC6310] to 
     detect PW defects, depending on the PSN type (e.g. MPLS PSN, MPLS-
     IP PSN). Any of these mechanisms can be used when monitoring the 
     state of Ethernet PWs. [RFC6310] also discusses the applicability 
     of these failure detection mechanisms. 
           
     4.1. Use of Native Service (NS) Notification  

      
     When a MEP is defined on the PE and associated with an Ethernet 
     PW, the PE can use native service OAM capabilities for failure 
     notifications. Options include:  
               
         - Sending of AIS frames from the local MEP to the MEP on the 
     remote PE when the MEP needs to convey PE receive defects, and when 
     CCM transmission is disabled.  
      
         - Suspension of CCM frames transmission from the local MEP to 
     the peer MEP on the remote PE to convey PE receive defects, when 
     CCM transmission is enabled.  
      
         - Setting the RDI bit in transmitted CCM frames, when loss of 
     CCMs from the peer MEP is detected or the PE needs to convey PW 
     reverse defects.  
               
     These NS OAM notifications are inserted into the corresponding PW.  
               
     Similarly, when the defect conditions are cleared, a PE can take 
     one of the following actions, depending on the mechanism that was 
     used for failure notification, to clear the defect sate on the peer 
     PE:  
               
          - Stopping AIS frame transmission from the local MEP to the 
     MEP on the remote PE to clear PW receive defects.

          - Resuming CCM frames transmission from the local MEP to the 
     peer MEP on the remote PE to clear PW forward defects notification, 
     when CCM transmission is enabled.  
      
          - Clearing the RDI bit in transmitted CCM frames, to clear PW 
     transmit defects notification, when CCM transmission is enabled.  
            

     4.2. Use of PW Status notification for MPLS PSNs 

      

     When PWs are established using LDP, LDP status notification 
     signaling MUST be used as the default mechanism to signal AC and PW 
     status and defects [RFC4447]. That is known as the "coupled loop 
     mode". For PWs established over an MPLS or MPLS-IP PSN using other 
     mechanisms (e.g. static configuration), inband signaling using 
     VCCV-BFD [RFC5885] SHOULD be used to convey AC and PW status and 
     defects.  

      

     [RFC6310] identifies the following PW defect status codepoints:  

         

        - Forward defect: corresponds to a logical OR of local AC 
        (ingress) Receive fault, local PSN-facing PW (egress) transmit 
        fault, and PW not forwarding fault.  

         

        - Reverse defect: corresponds to a logical OR of local AC 
        (egress) transmit fault and local PW PSN-facing (ingress) 
        receive fault.  

      

     There are also scenarios where a PE carries out PW label withdrawal 
     instead of PW status notification. These include administrative 
     disablement of the PW or loss of Target LDP session with the peer 
     PE.

     4.3. Use of BFD Diagnostic Codes 

      

     When using VCCV, the control channel (CC) type and Connectivity 
     Verification (CV) Type are agreed on between the peer PEs using the 
     OAM capability sub-TLV signaled as part of the interface parameter 
     TLV when using FEC 129 and the interface parameter sub-TLV when 
     using FEC 128.  

      

     As defined in [RFC6310], when CV type of 0x04 0r 0x10 is used to 
     indicate that BFD is used for PW fault detection only, PW defect is 
     detected via the BFD session while other defects, such as AC defect 
     or PE internal defects preventing it from forwarding traffic, are 
     communicated via LDP Status notification message in MPLS and MPLS-
     IP PSNs or other mechanisms in L2TP-IP PSN.  

      

     Similarly, when CV type of 0x08 or 0x20 is used to indicate that 
     BFD is used for both PW fault detection and AC/PW Fault 
     Notification, all defects are signaled via BFD. 

      

     5. Ethernet AC Defect States Entry or Exit Criteria 

         

     5.1. AC Receive Defect State Entry or Exit 

      

     PE1 enters the AC Receive Defect state if any of the following 
     conditions is met:  

      

     - It detects or is notified of a physical layer fault on the 
     Ethernet interface. Ethernet link failure can be detected based on 
     loss of signal (LoS) or via Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] critical link 
     event notifications generated at an upstream node CE1 with "Dying 
     Gasp" or "Critical Event" indication.

     - A MEP associated with the local AC receives an Ethernet AIS 
     frame.  

      

     - A MEP associated with the local AC does not receive CCM frames 
     from the peer MEP in the client domain (e.g. CE1) within an 
     interval equal to 3.5 times the CCM transmission period configured 
     for the MEP. This is the case when CCM transmission is enabled.  

      

     - A CCM with interface status TLV indicating interface down. Other 
     CCM interface status TLVs will not be used to indicate failure or 
     recovery from failure.   

      

     PE1 exits the AC Receive Defect state if all of the conditions that 
     resulted in entering the defect state are cleared. This includes 
     all of the following conditions:  

      

     - Any physical layer fault on the Ethernet interface, if detected 
     or notified previously is removed (e.g., loss of signal(LoS) 
     cleared, or Ethernet Link OAM [802.3] critical link event 
     notifications with "Dying Gasp" or "Critical Event" indication 
     cleared at an upstream node CE1).  

      

     - A MEP associated with the local AC does not receive any Ethernet 
     AIS frame within a period indicated by previously received AIS, if 
     AIS resulted in entering the defect state.   

      

     - A MEP associated with the local AC and configured with CCM 
     enabled receives a configured number (e.g., 3 or more) of 
     consecutive CCM frames from the peer MEP on CE1 within an interval 
     equal to a multiple (3.5) of the CCM transmission period configured 
     for the MEP.

     5.2. AC Transmit Defect State Entry or Exit 

      
     PE1 enters the AC Transmit Defect state if any of the following 
     conditions is met:  
               
     - It detects or is notified of a physical layer fault on the 
     Ethernet interface (e.g., via loss of signal (LoS) or Ethernet Link 
     OAM [802.3] critical link event notifications generated at an 
     upstream node CE1 with "Link Fault" indication).  
      
     - A MEP configured with CCM transmission enabled and associated 
     with the local AC receives a CCM frame, with its RDI bit set, from 
     the peer MEP in the client domain (e.g., CE1).   
               
     PE1 exits the AC Transmit Defect state if all of the conditions 
     that resulted in entering the defect state are cleared. This 
     includes all of the following conditions:  
      
     - Any physical layer fault on the Ethernet interface, if detected 
     or notified previously is removed (e.g., LOS cleared, Ethernet Link 
     OAM [802.3] critical link event notifications with "Link Fault" 
     indication cleared at an upstream node CE1).  
            
     - A MEP configured with CCM transmission enabled and associated  
     with the local AC does not receive a CCM frame with RDI bit set, 
     having received a previous CCM frame with RDI bit set from the peer 
     MEP in the client domain (e.g. CE1). 
      
     6. Ethernet AC and PW Defect States Interworking 

         

     6.1. PW Receive Defect Entry Procedures 

      

     When the PW status on PE1 transitions from working to PW Receive 
     Defect state, PE1's ability to receive user traffic from CE2 is 
     impacted. As a result, PE1 needs to notify CE1 about this problem.

     Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-eth-oam-iwk-06   July 2012 
         

     Upon entry to the PW Receive Defect state, the following must be 
     done:  

      

     - If PE1 is configured with a down MEP associated with the local AC 
     and CCM transmission is not enabled, the MEP associated with the AC 
     must transmit AIS frames periodically to the peer MEP in the client 
     domain (e.g., on CE1) based on configured AIS transmission period.  

      

     - If PE1 is configured with a down MEP associated with the local AC 
     and CCM transmission is enabled, and the MEP associated with the AC 
     is configured to support Interface Status TLV in CCM messages, the 
     MEP associated with the AC must transmit CCM frames with Interface 
     Status TLV as being down to the peer MEP in the client domain 
     (e.g., on CE1).  

      

     - If PE1 is configured with a down MEP associated with the local AC 
     and CCM transmission is enabled, and the MEP associated with the AC 
     is configured to not support Interface Status TLV in CCM messages, 
     the MEP associated with the AC must stop transmitting CCM frames to 
     the peer MEP in the client domain (e.g., on CE1).  

      

     - If PE1 is configured to run E-LMI [MEF16] with CE1 and if E-LMI 
     is used for failure notification, PE1 must transmit E-LMI 
     asynchronous STATUS message with report type Single EVC 
     Asynchronous Status indicating that PW is Not Active.  

      

     Further, when PE1 enters the Receive Defect state, it must assume 
     that PE2 has no knowledge of the defect and must send reverse 
     defect failure notification to PE2. For MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP PSN, 
     this is done via either a PW Status notification message indicating 
     a reverse defect; or via VCCV-BFD diagnostic code of reverse defect 
     if VCCV CV type of 0x08 had been negotiated. When Native Service 
     OAM mechanism is supported on PE1, it can also use the NS OAM 
     notification as specified in Section 4.1.

     If PW receive defect is entered as a result of a forward defect 
     notification from PE2 or via loss of control adjacency, no 
     additional action is needed since PE2 is expected to be aware of 
     the defect. 

      

     6.2. PW Receive Defect Exit Procedures 

      

     When the PW status transitions from PW Receive Defect state to 
     working, PE1's ability to receive user traffic from CE2 is 
     restored. As a result, PE1 needs to cease defect notification to 
     CE1 by performing the following:  

      

     - If PE1 is configured with a down MEP associated with the local AC 
     and CCM transmission is not enabled, the MEP associated with the AC 
     must stop transmitting AIS frames towards the peer MEP in the 
     client domain (e.g., on CE1).  

      

     - If PE1 is configured with a down MEP associated with the local AC 
     and CCM transmission is enabled, and the MEP associated with the AC 
     is configured to support Interface Status TLV in CCM messages, the 
     MEP associated with the AC must transmit CCM frames with Interface 
     Status TLV as being Up to the peer MEP in the client domain (e.g., 
     on CE1). 

      

     - If PE1 is configured with a down MEP associated with the local AC 
     and CCM transmission is enabled, and the MEP associated with the AC 
     is configured to not support Interface Status TLV in CCM messages, 
     the MEP associated with the AC must resume transmitting  CCM frames 
     to the peer MEP in the client domain (e.g., on CE1).  

      

     - If PE1 is configured to run E-LMI [MEF16] with CE1 and E-LMI is 
     used for fault notification, PE1 must transmit E-LMI asynchronous 
     STATUS message with report type Single EVC Asynchronous Status 
     indicating that PW is Active.

     Further, if the PW receive defect was explicitly detected by PE1, 
     it must now notify PE2 about clearing of Receive Defect state by 
     clearing reverse defect notification. For PWs over MPLS PSN or 
     MPLS-IP PSN, this is either done via PW Status message indicating 
     working; or via VCCV-BFD diagnostic code if VCCV CV type of 
     0x08/0x20 had been negotiated. When Native Service OAM mechanism is 
     supported on PE, it can also clear the NS OAM notification 
     specified in Section 4.1. 

      

     If PW receive defect was established via notification from PE2 or 
     via loss of control adjacency, no additional action is needed, 
     since PE2 is expected to be aware of the defect clearing. 

      

     6.3. PW Transmit Defect Entry Procedures 

      

     When the PW status transitions from working to PW Transmit Defect 
     state, PE1's ability to transmit user traffic to CE2 is impacted. 
     As a result, PE1 needs to notify CE1 about this problem which has 
     been detected by PE1. 

      

     Upon entry to the PW Transmit Defect state, the following must be 
     done:  

      

     - If PE1 is configured with a down MEP associated with the local AC 
     and CCM transmission is enabled, the MEP associated with the AC 
     MUST set the RDI bit in transmitted CCM frames or send status TLV 
     with interface down to the peer MEP in the client domain (e.g., on 
     CE1). 

      

     - If PE1 is configured to run E-LMI [MEF16] with CE1 and E-LMI is 
     used for fault notification, PE1 must transmit E-LMI asynchronous 
     STATUS message with report type Single EVC Asynchronous Status 
     indicating that PW is Not Active.

     When the PW status transitions from PW Transmit Defect state to 
     working, PE1's ability to transmit user traffic to CE2 is restored. 
     As a result, PE1 needs to cease defect notifications to CE1 and 
     perform the following: 

      

     - If PE1 is configured with a down MEP associated with the local AC

     If the AC receive defect is detected by PE1, it must notify PE2 in 
     the form of a forward defect notification.  

      

     When NS OAM is not supported on PE1, and for PW over MPLS PSN or 
     MPLS-IP PSN, forward defect notification is done via either PW 
     Status message indicating a forward defect or via VCCV-BFD 
     diagnostic code of forward defect if VCCV CV type of 0x08/0x20 had 
     been negotiated.

     When Native Service OAM mechanism is supported on PE1, it can also 
     use the NS OAM notification as specified in Section 4.1.  

      

     In addition to the above actions, PE1 must perform the following: 

      

     - If PE1 is configured with a down MEP associated with the local AC 
     and CCM transmission is enabled, the MEP associated with the AC 
     must set the RDI bit in transmitted CCM frames.

     If the AC transmit defect is detected by PE1, it must notify PE2 in

     When NS OAM is not supported on PE1, in PW over MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP 
     PSN, reverse defect notification is either done via PW Status 
     message indicating a reverse defect; or via VCCV-BFD diagnostic

     7. Security Considerations 

         

     The OAM interworking mechanisms described in this document do not 
     change the security functions inherent in the actual messages.  All 
     generic security considerations applicable to PW traffic specified 
     in Section 10 of [RFC3985] are applicable to NS OAM messages 
     transferred inside the PW. 

      

     Security considerations in Section 10 of [RFC5085] for VCCV apply 
     to the OAM messages thus transferred.  Security considerations 
     applicable to the PWE3 control protocol of [RFC4447] Section 8.2 
     apply to OAM indications transferred using the LDP status message. 

      

     Since the mechanisms of this document enable propagation of OAM 
     messages and fault conditions between native service networks and 
     PSNs, continuity of the end-to-end service depends on a trust 
     relationship between the operators of these networks.  Security 
     considerations for such scenarios are discussed in Section 7 of 
     [RFC5254]. 

      

     8. IANA Considerations 

      

     This document has no actions for IANA.

     11. Appendix A: Ethernet Native Service Management 

      

     Ethernet OAM mechanisms are broadly classified into two categories:  
     Fault Management (FM) and Performance Monitoring (PM). ITU-T Y.1731 
     provides coverage for both FM and PM while IEEE 802.1ag provides 
     coverage for a sub-set of FM functions. 

     
     Ethernet OAM also introduces the concept of Maintenance Entity (ME) 
     which is used to identify the entity that needs to be managed. An 
     ME is inherently a point-to-point association. However, in case of 
     a multipoint association, Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) consisting 
     of different MEs is used. IEEE 802.1 uses the concept of 
     Maintenance Association (MA) which is used to identify both point-
     to-point and multipoint associations. Each MA consists of 
     Maintenance End Points (MEPs) which are responsible for originating 
     OAM frames. In between the MEPs, there can also be Maintenance 
     Intermediate Points (MIPs) which do not originate OAM frames 
     however do respond to OAM frames from MEPs.

     Ethernet OAM allows for hierarchical maintenance entities to allow 
     for simultaneous end-to-end and segment monitoring. This is 
     achieved by having a provision of up to 8 Maintenance Domain Levels 
     (MD Levels) where each MEP or MIP is associated with a specific MD 
     Level. 

      

     It is important to note that the common set of FM mechanisms 
     between IEEE 802.1ag and ITU-T Y.1731 are completely compatible. 

      

     The common FM mechanisms include: 

        1) Continuity Check Messages (CCM) 

        2) Loopback Message (LBM) and Loopback Reply (LBR) 

        3) Linktrace Message (LTM) and Linktrace Reply (LTR) 

      

     CCM messages are used for fault detection including misconnections 
     and mis-configurations. Typically CCM messages are sent as 
     multicast frames or Unicast frames and also allow RDI 
     notifications. LBM/LBR are used to perform fault verification, 
     while also allow for MTU verification and CIR/EIR measurements. 
     LTM/LTR can be used for discovering the path traversed between a 
     MEP and another target MIP/MEP in the same MA. LTM/LTR also allow 
     for fault localization. 

      

     In addition, ITU-T Y.1731 also specifies the following FM 
     functions: 

        4) Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) 

      

     AIS allows for fault notification to downstream and upstream nodes. 

     Further, ITU-T Y.1731 also specifies the following PM functions: 

        5) Loss Measurement Message (LMM) and Reply (LMR)

        6) Delay Measurement Message (DMR) and Reply (DMR) 

        7) 1-way Delay Message (1DM) 

      

     While LMM/LMR is used to measure Frame Loss Ratio (FLR), DMM/DMR is 
     used to measure single-ended (aka two-way) Frame Delay (FD) and 
     Frame Delay Variation (FDV, also known as Jitter). 1DM can be used 
     for dual-ended (aka one-way) FD and FDV measurements.
