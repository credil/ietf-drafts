1.  Introduction

   [RFC3023] created the +xml suffix convention that may be used by
   media types whose representation uses XML underneath, that is, they
   could have been successfully parsed as if the media type had been
   application/xml in addition to their being parsed as their media type
   that is using the +xml suffix.  [I-D.ietf-appsawg-media-type-regs]
   defines a registry to be used for future Structured Syntax Suffixes.

   A variety of Structured Syntax Suffixes have already been used in
   some Media Type registration, in particular "+json", "+der",
   "+fastinfoset" and "+wbxml".  This document defines and registers
   these Structured Syntax Suffixes in the Structured Syntax Suffix
   registry, along with "+ber" and "+zip".

   Discussion of this document should occur in the Apps Area Working
   Group (apps-discuss@ietf.org).  [RFC Editor note: remove this
   paragraph.]

2.  When to Use these Structured Syntax Suffixes

   Each of the Structured Syntax Suffixes defined in this document are
   appropriate for use when the media type identifies the semantics of
   the protocol payload.  That is, knowing the semantics of the specific
   media type provides for more specific processing of the content than
   that afforded by generic processing of the underlying representation.

   At the same time, using the suffix provides receivers of the media
   types to do generic processing of the underlying representation in
   cases where 1) they do not need to handle specially the particular
   semantics of the exact media type, and, 2) there is no special
   knowledge needed by such a generic processor in order to parse that
   underlying representation other than what would be needed to parse
   any example of that underlying representation.

3.  The +json Structured Syntax Suffix

   [RFC4627] defines the "application/json" media type.  The suffix
   "+json" may be used with any media type whose representation follows
   that established for "application/json".  The Message Type Structured
   Syntax Suffix registration form follows:

   Name                JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

   +suffix             +json

   Encoding considerations Per [RFC4627], JSON may be represented using
                       UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.  When JSON is written
                       in UTF-8, JSON is 8bit compatible.  When JSON is
                       written in UTF-16 or UTF-32, JSON is binary.

4.  The +ber and +der Structured Syntax Suffixes

   The ITU defined the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and Distinguished
   Encoding Rules (DER) message transfer syntaxes in [ITU.X690.2008].
   The suffix "+ber" may be used with any media type whose
   representation follows the BER message transfer syntax.  The suffix
   "+der" may be used with any media type whose representation follows
   the DER message transfer syntax.  The Message Type Structured Syntax
   Suffix registration forms follows:

   Name                Basic Encoding Rules (BER) message transfer
                       syntax

   +suffix             +ber

   References          [ITU.X690.2008]

   Encoding considerations BER is a binary encoding.

   Interoperability considerations n/a

   Security considerations There are no security considerations inherent
                       in BER.  Each individual media type registered
                       with a +ber suffix may have additional security
                       considerations.

5.  The +fastinfoset Structured Syntax Suffix

   The ITU defined the Fast Infoset document format as a binary
   representation of the XML Information Set in [ITU.X891.2005].  These
   documents further define the "application/fastinfoset" media type.
   The suffix "+fastinfoset" may be used with any media type whose
   representation follows that established for "application/
   fastinfoset".  The Message Type Structured Syntax Suffix registration
   form follows:

   Name                Fast Infoset document format

   +suffix             +fastinfoset

   References          [ITU.X891.2005]

   Encoding considerations Fast Infoset is a binary encoding.  The
                       binary, quoted-printable and base64 content-
                       transfer-encodings are suitable for use with Fast
                       Infoset.

   Interoperability considerations n/a

   Security considerations There are no security considerations inherent
                       in Fast Infoset.  Each individual media type
                       registered with a +fastinfoset suffix may have
                       additional security considerations.

Internet-Draft       Additional Media Type Suffixes           April 2012


   The WAP Forum has defined the WAP Binary XML (WBXML) document format
   as a binary representation of XML in [WBXML].  This document further
   defines the "application/vnd.wap.wbxml" media type.  The suffix
   "+wbxml" may be used with any media type whose representation follows
   that established for "application/vnd.wap.wbxml".  The Message Type
   Structured Syntax Suffix registration form follows:

   Name                WAP Binary XML (WBXML) document format

   +suffix             +wbxml

   References          [WBXML]

   Encoding considerations WBXML is a binary encoding.

   Interoperability considerations n/a

   Security considerations There are no security considerations inherent
                       in WBXML.  Each individual media type registered
                       with a +wbxml suffix may have additional security
                       considerations.

7.  The +zip Structured Syntax Suffix

   The ZIP format is a public domain, cross-platform, interoperable file
   storage and transfer format, originally defined by PKWARE, Inc.; it
   supports compression and encryption and is used as the underlying
   representation by a variety of file formats.  The media type
   "application/zip" has been registered for such files.  The suffix
   "+zip" may be used with any media type whose representation follows
   that established for "application/zip".  The Message Type Structured
   Syntax Suffix registration form follows:

   Name                ZIP file storage and transfer format

   +suffix             +zip

   References          [ZIP]

   Encoding considerations ZIP is a binary encoding.

   Security considerations ZIP files support two forms of encryption:
                       Strong Encryption and AES 128-bit, 192-bit and
                       256-bit encryption; see the specification for
                       further details.  Each individual media type
                       registered with a +zip suffix may have additional
                       security considerations.
