 Abstract 

    The GMPLS RSVP-TE setup procedure for transport LSPs outlined in 
    [RFC3473] involves a single iteration signaling sequence. However 
    there are certain scenarios, where it is not feasible to make an LSP 
    fully operational and ready for use via the existing single-step 
    setup procedure. This document proposes a 2-iteration setup 
    procedure for gracefully bringing up transport LSPs in such cases.

 1. Introduction 

    The GMPLS RSVP-TE extensions required for setting up transport LSPs 
    are discussed in [RFC3473]. As per the existing setup procedure, the 
    signaling sequence commences with the ingress sending a PATH message 
    downstream. The PATH message traverses through all the intermediate 
    nodes and reaches the egress. The egress responds to the setup 
    request by sending a RESV message upstream. The setup iteration is 
    completed when the RESV reaches the ingress. At the end of this 
    iteration, the LSP is deemed operational and ready for use at the 
    ingress. Optionally, if the egress desires a confirmation, the 
    ingress would send a RESV-CONFIRM message downstream. The LSP is 
    deemed operational at the egress as soon as it receives the RESV-
    CONFIRM.

 Internet-Draft      RSVP Graceful Setup Procedure          October 2013 
         

    However, in certain cases (Section 3) there is no guarantee that the 
    LSP is operational and ready for use at the end of this first 
    iteration. This document proposes the use of a 2-iteration setup 
    procedure to cater to those cases. By the end of this Graceful Setup 
    Procedure, the end-points are guaranteed that the LSP is operational 
    and ready for immediate use.                   

 2. Graceful Setup Procedure 

    The RSVP graceful setup procedure (illustrated in Figure 1) proposed 
    by this document involves two distinct steps. This setup procedure 
    is similar in spirit to the 2-step RSVP graceful deletion procedure 
    outlined in [RFC3473]. 

    In the first step, the LSP is signaled as "non-operational" - the 
    PATH is sent out with the "A" (Administratively Down) bit set in the 
    ADMIN_STATUS object. All the resources along the path of the LSP are 
    allocated and bound during this iteration.  

    The LSP is made "operational" only in the second step - the PATH is 
    sent out with the "A" bit cleared in the ADMIN_STATUS. The LSP is 
    deemed fully operational by the egress when it receives the PATH 
    with the "A" bit cleared in the ADMIN_STATUS. Similarly, the LSP is 
    deemed ready for immediate use by the ingress when it receives the 
    RESV with the "A" bit cleared in the ADMIN_STATUS.

 3.   Use Case 

 3.1. Lambda LSP setup 

    After all the cross-connects are set up in both directions at each 
    node along the path of the LSP and the lasers are turned on at both 
    the ends, the Lambda LSP may still not be ready for immediate use. 
    Certain provisioning operations would need to be performed at each 
    node along the path of the LSP before it is deemed operational. By 
    adopting the Graceful Setup Procedure for Lambda LSPs, operations 
    like "enabling alarm monitoring" and "equalizing power-levels" can 
    get executed in the second step.  

 4. Security Considerations 

    TBD 

 5. IANA Considerations 

    None.
