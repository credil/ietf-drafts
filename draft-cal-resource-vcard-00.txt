                      draft-cal-resource-vcard-00

Abstract

   This specification describes the vCard representation of resources
   for calendaring and scheduling.  A resource in the scheduling context
   is any shared entity that can be scheduled by a calendar user, but
   does not control its own attendance status.

Internet-Draft        vCard for Calendar Resources            April 2012


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines the vCard representation of calendaring
   resources to ease the discovery and scheduling of resources between
   any calendar client and server.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  General Considerations

   Data values must have valid representation for the specified value
   type with respect to escape characters, line folding, and so on.

4.  ABNF Format and Cardinality Definitions

   Format and cardinality of new vCard properties are defined as
   described in Section 3.3 of [RFC6350].

   object.  Additional proprietary properties may be defined as well,
   but must begin with "X-".  Clients encountering properties they don't
   know about must ignore them.

   Properties required to contact the resource are not included in this
   specification. vCard properties defined in vCard Format Specification
   [RFC6350] can be used to include contact information for the
   resource.

   Special Notes:
      The value of this property is used to calculate the earliest date
      and time when a resource can be reserved for an event starting on
      a specific date and time.
      If this property value is defined, the resource may be booked for
      an event at a certain time, only if the current time is equal to
      or after the date and time calculated by subtracting this value
      from the event's proposed start time.  If this property is absent,
      then the resource may be booked at any time before the end of the
      booking window.

   Purpose:
      Defines how much time in advance the resource booking is closed.

   ValueType:
      Duration value.
      The format is based on the [ISO.8601.2004] duration representation
      basic format with designators for the duration of time.  The
      format can represent nominal durations (weeks and days) and
      accurate durations (hours, minutes, and seconds).  The syntax is

   ABNF:
      BOOKINGWINDOWEND-param = "VALUE=text" / any-param
      BOOKINGWINDOWEND-value = text

   Special Notes:
      The value of this property is used to calculate the latest date
      and time when a resource can be reserved for an event starting on
      a specific date and time.
      If the current time is equal to or before the value obtained by
      subtracting BookingWindowEnd from the start date and time of the
      event, then the resource may be booked.  If this property is
      absent, then the resource may be booked anytime from booking
      window start to the start of the event.
      BookingWindow Start and End together provide the window of time a
      resource can be booked, relative to the start time of the event.

               If BookingWindowStart = BwS,
               BookingWindowEnd = BwE,
               Current Time = CT and
               Event Start Time = ST,
               a resource can be booked at a certain time only if
               CT is equal to or after (ST - BwS)
               and CT is equal to or before (ST - BwE)

8.  Security Considerations

   As this document only defines schema for representing resource
   information for calendaring and scheduling and does not refer to the
   actual storage mechanism itself, or the calendaring and scheduling
   protocol, no special security considerations are required as part of
   this document.

10.  Recommendations for Calendaring Systems

   While this document does not mandate how each of the defined property
   values must be used by calendaring systems, here are some
   recommendations:

   1.  BookingWindow Start (Section 6.23), Booking Window End
       (Section 6.24), and Multiple Bookings (Section 6.21) information
       should be used in freebusy calculations.  A query for a time slot
       that falls outside the booking window or one that already has the
       maximum allowed number of simultaneous bookings, must be returned
       as BUSY_UNAVAILABLE.

Internet-Draft        vCard for Calendar Resources            April 2012


   2.  Calendaring systems that support the auto schedule (Section 6.25)
       property, should automatically mark the attendee PARTSTAT for a
       resource as ACCEPTED, if its auto schedule value is TRUE and the
       scheduling is successful.  If owner approval is required, the
       PARTSTAT could be automatically marked as TENTATIVE.

   3.  Information like Capacity (Section 6.12) can be used by
       calendaring systems to warn end users if the number of attendees
       exceed the capacity value.

   Individual calendar servers may regard the values of these properties
   set in a directory server or a different database as advisory and
   could further limit what it allows.

11.  Acknowledgments

   This specification is a result of discussions that took place within
   the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium's Resource Technical
   Committee.  The authors thank the participants of that group, and
   specifically the following individuals for contributing their ideas
