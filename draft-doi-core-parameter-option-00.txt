Internet-Draft        CoAP Option Parameter Option           August 2012


1.  Introduction

   Content-Type field[RFC2045] and some HTTP headers[RFC2616] have
   'parameter' to make fine-grained description of contents and options.
   The document proposes the CoAP Option Parameter Option that enables
   wide range of parameter description over CoAP options.


2.  Use Cases of Option Parameter in CoAP

2.1.  Additional Content Negotiation

   [RFC2616] describes several use cases of parameters.  An example is
   use of Accept: headers defined in section 14.1.  If a node has
   preference of encodings, use of 'q=' parameter with other content
   type parameters is recommended to declare content type preference in
   Accept headers.

   A constrained data collector may have its preference in its
   acceptance data format.  A case is (SenML)[#I-D.jennings-senml-09]
   data receiver that supports both JSON and EXI.  With preference for
   EXI format, the accept line of the node in HTTP GET request may be as
   the followings.

      Accept: senml-exi, senml+json;q=0.8

2.2.  Parameter Coordination

   If a content-type have wide variety of parameters, a node need to
   know which parameter is acceptable or not via Accept: header. audio/
   rtp-midi[RFC6295] is an example of a content-type with various
   parameters.

   A constrained client is able to create payloads with specific
   rate=32500.  A server accepts any rate of audio/rtp-midi and it can
   receive 'audio/rtp-midi;rate=*'.  The client posts a payload Content-
   Type with 'audio/rtp-midi;rate=32500'.  The server may need to check
   if the content type of posted payload matches the expected content-
   type.

   The audio use case seems not to be widely used in CoAP so far.
   However, the same use case is applicable for sensor data.  Sensor
   data is time series data and it is possible to define a content type
   with preferred sensing interval to avoid over/underquality of
   sampling.

2.3.  Schema Negotiation of Schema-Informed EXI Communication

   In some use case of Schema-Informed (EXI)[#W3C.REC-exi-20110310], a
   server and a client need to coordinate a XML schema to encode a
   message.  If there are some versions of XML schemas in an
   application, a sender (may be server or client) needs to know schemas
   a receiver has.

   There are two choices.  First choice is to define a content-type for
   each version of XML schema.  But this is not widely acceptable.
   Content-type is a global space and not suitable to describe every
   minor revision.

   Second choice is make use of content-type parameters.  It seems to be
   more acceptable because parameter is local to its options or content-
   types.


3.  Option Parameter Option

3.1.  Requirements

   In general, an option parameter has following notations.

   parameter := ";" attribute "=" value
   attribute := token  ; case insensitive
   value := token / quoted-string

   In CoAP, an option parameter should have similar ability of
   expression with regards to some use cases.  At the same time, CoAP
   option should be compact enough to fit in constrained environments.

   As CoAP options do not have room for parameters, the option parameter
   option is designed to be an independent option that gives additional
   description on another option in a CoAP message.

   An attribute of CoAP option parameter should be fit in relatively
   smaller set.  The author considers the attribute part could be
   described in short integer (16 bits).  On the other hand, the value
   part should have higher degree of freedom for applications including
   wildcards and range description.  The author believes it is simple
   and safe to have a string value in option parameter option.

3.2.1.  Option-Parameter1, 2, 3

   The Option-Parameter options are used to attach a parameter on an
   option on the same CoAP message.  The option-parameter options are
   proxy unsafe, elective.  An Option-Parameter option has three fields:
   option index(oidx), attribute ID(aid), and value.

   |<---- option length -------->|

   +----+---------+---------....-+
   |oidx|   aid   | value        |
   +----+---------+---------....-+

   |<1B>|<2 Bytes>|<- optlen-3 ->|

   Figure 1: Structure of Option Parameter Options

   An option index is a 1-byte integer.  If an Option-Parameter has
   option index 3, the parameter is for 4th option in the header
   (0-origin).  Option index 255 is reserved.  Parameter assignment for
   255th or further in option index is not defined in this document.  A
   parameter option SHOULD NOT be attached to another parameter option.
   If proxy or other intermediate nodes add/remove options of an
   existing message, the node SHALL update option index of option
   parameter options accordingly, or parameter options SHALL be dropped
   from the message.

   Attribute ID is a 2-byte integer.  An attribute is described in
   2-byte integer as shown in the following table.

   Table 2: List of Attribute IDs

   Other attribute ID may be managed and added by IANA, based on first-
   come-first-serve basis for parameters defined in RFCs.  Parameters
   described in an internet draft or in proprietary extensions may be
   added upon approval of core WG experts.

   A value is opaque octets (Unicode string in most cases) with the
   length of the option length minus three (3) octets.  A value may be
   empty.  Meanings of the values are up to the option or the content-
   type.

   Since the option parameter option use index of option order, adding
   parameter option after building up other options may cause
   unnecessary implementation complexity.  To avoid it, there are three
   options per option number regions.  The Option-Parameter1 is for
   option number 0-(TBD1-1).  The Option Parameter2 is for option number
   (TBD1+1)-(TBD2-1).  The Option Parameter3 is for option number (TBD2+
   1)-65535.

   Note that options with option number (TBD3+1) to 65535 needs careful
   calculation of option index, because option parameter options should
   be inserted before the options with the option numbers.

   Proposed option numbers for TBD1, TBD2, TBD3 are 253, 2045, and
   65533.


4.  Security Considerations

   Applications on the CoAP should check the validity of parameters
   before use.  It may contain arbitrary string value.

   Attribute ID registry policy should be lined up with IANA
   considerations of [#I-D.ietf-core-coap].
