1.  Introduction

   This document describe Stateless Automatic IPv4 over IPv6
   Encapsulation / Decapsulation Technology (SA46T) multicast support.

   SA46T [I-D.draft-matsuhira-sa46t-spec] makes backbone network to IPv6
   only.  And also, SA46T can stack many IPv4 networks, i.e. the
   networks using same IPv4 (private) address, without interdependence.

   IPv4 multicast is supported by SA46T with same manner with IPv4
   unicast.


2.  Architecture of SA46T Multicast

   IPv4 multicast address is knows as Class D IPv4 address, 224.0.0.0/4.
   The range is from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.

   Mapping IPv4 multicast address to IPv6 addressing space, the IPv6
   address which mapped to IPv4 mapped address is also IPv6 multicast
   address space, because copy of the packet for multicasting may occuer
   not only in IPv4 subnet but also in IPv6 backbone.  So, SA46T
   multicast support require special IPv6 address prefix, SA46T
   multicast address prefix.

   Figure 1 show address architecutire of SA46T and SA46T multicast
   support.  Both unicast case and multicast case, mapping IPv4 address
   is the same, and usage of IPv4 network plane ID is the same, however,
   SA46T address prefix (unicast) and SA46T multicast address prefix is
   not the same.  If value of IPv4 network plane ID is the same, IPv4
   unicast address and IPv4 multicast address belong the same network
   plane.

   In this document, SA46T unicast address which contain IPv4 unicast
   address, and SA46T multicast address which contain IPv4 multicast
   address are used.

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 2 show the format of SA46T multicast address prefix.  IPv6
   multicast address has a prefix of FF00::/8.  SA46T multicast address
   prefix should be the same with IPv6 multicast address prefix.

   A group ID part of IPv6 multicast address is mapped with reserve
   space, IPv4 network plane ID, and IPv4 (multicast) address.

                                 Figure 2

   The information which indicate SA46T multicast address is needed,
   because there is a possibility the value of group ID for IPv6
   multicast and the value of "rsv+IPv4 network plane ID + IPv4
   multicast addres" is the same.

   This information is TBD.

   However, this version of this document supporse using flag space.
   The flag space consists four flags (bits), and high-order 3 flags are
   reserced, and 4th flag is T, which indicate the address is
   permanently-assinged (well-known) or non-parmanently-assinged
   (transient).

   There is a idea, which allocate SA46T multicast address flag in flag
   space, and using scop space also other idea, too


3.  Format of SA46T Multicast address

   This example is based on IPv6 Global Unicast Address Format
   [RFC3587].

   Figure 3 shows IPv6 Global Unicast Address Format.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document may make request of IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   SA46T use automatic encapsulation technologies.  Security
   consideration related tunneling technologies are discussed in
