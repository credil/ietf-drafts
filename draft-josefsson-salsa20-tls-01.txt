1.  Introduction

   This document describe how the Salsa20 stream cipher can be used in
   the Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.0 [RFC2246], TLS version
   1.1 [RFC4346], and TLS version 1.2 [RFC5246] protocols, as well as in
   the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) versions 1.0 [RFC4347]
   and 1.2 [RFC6347].  It can also be used with Secure Sockets Layer
   (SSL) version 3.0 [RFC6101].

   Salsa20 [SALSA20SPEC] is a stream cipher that has been designed for
   high performance in software implementations.  The cipher has compact
   implementation and uses few resources and inexpensive operations that
   makes it suitable for implementation on a wide range of
   architectures.  The cipher has been designed to minimize risk due to
   side channel attacks.  The cipher has trivial initialization sequence
   and provides good key agility and good performance over a range of
   data sizes.  Salsa20 is one of the ciphers selected as part of the
   eSTREAM portolio of stream ciphers [ESTREAM].

   Recent attacks [CBC-ATTACK] have indicated problems with CBC-mode
   cipher suites in TLS and DTLS as well as issues with the only
   supported stream cipher (RC4) [RC4-ATTACK].  While AEAD ciphersuites
   address these issues, concerns about their performance, on general
   purpose CPUs, are sometimes raised.

   Moreover, the RC4 cipher could not be used in DTLS because it did not
   provide random access in the key stream.  That allowed no choice of a
   fast stream cipher in the context of DTLS.

   The purpose of this document is to provide an alternative stream
   cipher for both TLS and DTLS that is comparable to RC4 in speed on a
   wide range of platforms.

2.  Salsa20 Cipher Suites

   The following variants of Salsa20 are specified.  The variants
   provide a range of performance and security that can be selected as
   appropriate.

   SALSA20R12: Salsa20 with 12 rounds and a 256 bit key.  This cipher
   corresponds to the eSTREAM Salsa20 with 256 bit key.

   SALSA20R20: Salsa20 with 20 rounds and a 256 bit key.  This is a
   higher security variant of Salsa20.

   The following ciphersuites are defined:

   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1           = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1           = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1   = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1   = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}

   CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1           = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1           = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}

   Note that Salsa20 requires a 64-bit nonce.  That nonce is updated on
   the encryption of every TLS record, and is set to be the 64-bit TLS
   record sequence number.

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, ECDHE_RSA, ECDHE_ECDSA, PSK, DHE_PSK, RSA_PSK,
   ECDHE_PSK key exchanges are performed as defined in RFC 5246, RFC
   4492 and RFC 5489.

   The MAC algorithm to use is HMAC-SHA1 [RFC6234].  [[[XXX: For better
   performance, we consider the use of UMAC-AES-96, UMAC-AES-128
   [RFC4418] or Poly1305 instead of HMAC-SHA1.]]]

   The pseudorandom function (PRF) for TLS 1.2 is the TLS PRF with SHA-
   256 as the hash function.  When used with TLS versions prior to 1.2,
   the PRF is calculated as specified in the appropriate version of the
   TLS specification.

   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1       = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R12_SHA1     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_SALSA20R20_SHA1     = {0xTBD, 0xTBD}

5.  Security Considerations

   The security of Salsa20 is discussed in the Salsa20 security
   [SALSA20-SECURITY] paper.  The reader must consult cryptographic
   research to find out the current security status of Salsa20.  At the
   time of writing this document, there are no known significant
   security problems with Salsa20/12 or Salsa20/20.  As of early 2013,
   the best cryptanalysis breaks 8 out of 20 rounds to recover the 256-
   bit secret key in 2^251 operations, using 2^31 keystream pairs (see
   [SALSA20-ATTACK]).  For more background, see the eSTREAM report
   [ESTREAM].

   There are no ciphersuites defined in this document that utilize the
   variant of Salsa20 with 128-bit key material, because (due to the
   design of Salsa20) they provide no performance advantage over the
   256-bit variant.

   This document should not introduce any other security considerations
   than those that directly follow from any use of the stream cipher
   Salsa20 and those that directly follow from introducing any set of
   stream cipher suites into TLS and DTLS.
