    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines an extensible metadata member that may be
      inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to process
      those responses. It is expressed as a member called "_links" that is
      inserted as the top level member in the responses. It will allow the
      client to learn where the members in the response could be used and how,
      etc. Since it is just a member, any client that does not understand this
      extension should not break and work normally while supporting clients
      can utilize the metadata to its advantage.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Although <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref> has been known for
      its REST friendliness, OAuth itself is not RESTful, as it heavily relies
      on out-of-band information to drive the interactions. This situation can
      be eased by hypertext-enabling the JSON responses through the
      introduction of a member that represents such hypertext and other
      metadata. To achieve this, this specification introduces a top level
      member <spanx style="verb">_links</spanx> that represents various link
      relationships and other metadata.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="metaobjects" title="JSON Meta Object">
      <t>A JSON Meta Object uses the format described in <xref
      target="RFC4627"/> and is intended to be inserted into a JSON document
      to express some of the metadata associated with it as <spanx
      style="verb">_links</spanx> member.</t>

      <t>The value of the <spanx style="verb">_links</spanx> member is a JSON
      object that expresses link relations (<spanx style="verb">rel</spanx>),
      which in turn holds an object with <spanx style="verb">href</spanx> and
      other members or an array of such objects.</t>

      <t>Following non-normative schematic example should help envisage what
      it would look like. (Note: line-wraps are for display purpose only.)</t>

      <t/>

      <t>Here, we have <spanx style="verb">_links</spanx> member that
      expresses various "relations" such as <spanx style="verb">self</spanx>
      and <spanx style="verb">userinfo</spanx>, which is a resource type of
      OpenID Connect's Userinfo endpoint. Each relationships has either a link
      relations object or an array of link relations objects as its value. The
      link relations objects holds various members such as <spanx
      style="verb">href</spanx>. They are explained in the next section.</t>

      <t/>

      <section anchor="_links" title="_links Member">
        <t><spanx style="verb">_links</spanx> member holds exactly one object

        <spanx style="verb">string</spanx> SHOULD be a link relation type that
        is either defined in the IANA registry defined in <xref format="title"
        target="RFC5988">Web Linking</xref> or a URI that describes the
        relation.</t>

        <t>Each relation member holds exactly one object or one array, whose
        elements are objects. Each object has following members, which are all
        optional.</t>

        <section anchor="href" title="href">
          <t>The value of the <spanx style="verb">href</spanx> member is a

          to. The values for template parameters SHOULD be taken from the
          value of the top-level members in the including JSON object whose
          <spanx style="verb">string</spanx> matches the template variable
          name.</t>

          templated in exactly the same syntax as in <xref
