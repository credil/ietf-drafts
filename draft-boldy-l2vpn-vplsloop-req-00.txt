Abstract

    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) implementations, as defined in 
    [RFC4761] and [RFC4762], are highly susceptible to layer-2 loops 
    external to the PE customer-facing interface. Such loops impact 
    performance and can have a detrimental affect on all VPLS traffic 
    throughout the entire instance under certain conditions.

    Current Layer-2 loop detection and protection mechanisms do not
    function effectively here.

    This document describes the requirements for a protocol function  
    to offer VPLS service providers a mechanism for detecting such 
    layer-2 loops and facilitating configurable actions without the 
    need for inter-operation with customer network protocols, other 
    VPLS PEs or customer sourced frames.

1. Introduction

    Regardless of how physically or logically a VPLS external connection
    is made into an MPLS Perimeter Edge Router (PE), the VPLS instance 
    within each PE builds a per-instance MAC-address table much like a 
    physical ethernet switch.

    Unlike a physical ethernet switch, or a collection of them, the 
    layer-2 broadcast domain of a VPLS instance straddles operational 
    boundaries between the customer and the service-provider. This makes
    the deployment and ongoing operational aspects of well-known layer-2
    loop protection mechanisms difficult and provides the need for a 
    solution that is solely owned and operated by the service-provider 
    at the PE, on a per-connection basis.

2. Terminology

    Herein this document uses the following terminology:

    External Interface:          Any connection into a VPLS instance on
                                 a MPLS Perimeter Edge (PE) router.

    External layer-2 segment:    The per-customer-site layer-2
                                 broadcast domain that is connected to,
                                 but external of the service provider
                                 controlled VPLS instance.

    External Loop:               A loop that is a layer-2 loop itself
                                 or creates a layer-2 loop within the
                                 external layer-2 segment.

    Loop-Connected-PE:           A PE that has an interface from which
                                 an external loop is present.

3. Problem Definition and Scope

    When an external-loop is created within the VPLS broadcast domain,
    there are serious negative data-plane impacts. The scope and 
    severity of these issues varies due to several related factors. The 
    following identifies the three main contributing factors:

3.1. Type of Loop

    Including but not limited to:

    1. Layer-1 loop at the PE interface or within the same ethernet
            collision domain.
    2. Layer-2 loop external to the PE within a broadcast domain that
            includes only one PE interface.
    3. Layer-2 loop external to the PE within a broadcast domain that
            includes more than one PE interface.

    An example of each of these is shown in Figure 1 below using the
    following abbreviations:

    PE:  MPLS Perimeter Edge Router
    CS:  Customer Switch
    CR:  Customer Router

    Loops are shown by number referencing the above list. All layer-2
    links are assumed to be in the same VLAN.

3.2. Instance Specific Traffic Flow

    The extent to which traffic flows over the Loop-Connected-PE, either
    by specific instance learning restrictions or by a higher layer
    communication topology.
    At layer-2 this simply is the number of connections from the same or
    other PEs that send frames to connections on the Loop-Connected-PE.

3.3. Size of the VPLS layer-2 broadcast domain

    Determined by:

    1. Number of individual interfaces from all PEs participating in 
            the specific VPLS instance.
    2. Number of PEs containing interfaces participating in the 
            specific VPLS instance.
    3. Number of MAC-Addresses being learnt from all PE interfaces
            participating in the specific VPLS instance.
    4. OSI functional level of the device externally connected to each
            interface.

3.4. Scenario

    To understand the scope and severity of any external loop on a VPLS 
    instance, this section walks through a simplified and linear process    
    for a very basic three-site VPLS instance sending very occasional 
    frames based on the topology in Figure 2 below.

                      .......|PE 2|........

                      (Loop)
                      +----+
                      |PC C|
                      +----+

Example.

    1. PC-B sends a frame to PC-C
    2. PE-1 adds PC-Bs MAC-Address to its MAC-Table for this VPLS
           instance.
    3. Due to a previous MAC-Table entry on PE-1 (created by a frame 
           from PC-C sent when the loop was not present) the frame is 
           unicast out the interface connecting to PC-C.
    4. The frame loops back at the external loop to PE-1.
    5. PE-1 now learns that the MAC-Address of PC-B is out the interface
            towards PC-C.
    6. Now PC-A sends a frame to PC-B
    7. PE-3 has a previous entry in its MAC-Table to send it to PE-1
    8. PE-1 sends the frame incorrectly to the interface towards PC-C
    9. The frame now loops back into PE-1 with the source-address of PC-A
    10. PC-B now sends a frame to PC-A which is now sent to the    
            interface towards PC-C and may never get to PC-A.

    As is clear, this example is highly simplified. Due to traffic 
    streams MAC-learning would be flapping for all unicast frames sent 
    towards the loop on PE-1. At a certain rate this will cause flooding 
    of what should be known-unicast-frames, which then propagates looped 
    frames to other PEs in the VPLS instance. This in-turn populates 
    their MAC-Address tables with incorrect information.

    This has the affect of sending more traffic towards the loop thus
    creating more and more MAC-Table instability and thus more flooding
    which, without interruption, will eventually prevent higher layer
    protocols from functioning.

    The affect of the above in a real-world network with 1000s of 
    traffic flows and expected legitimate broadcast traffic can result 
    in total loss of service for the entire VPLS instance within a very 
    short timeframe.

4. Requirements

    Ethernet loop detection and protection is nothing new. There are
    several clearly defined and adopted protocols for this function and
    it is not the intent of this document to discuss any one or all or
    these except to identify requirement that are not addressed as a whole 
    or individually by such protocols.

    These requirements are detailed here:

    1. The protection mechanism MUST be configurable solely on the    
            service provider PE router, independent of customer device 
            capability and configuration within the scope of industry 
            standard default behavior of such devices.
    2. The protection mechanism MUST be able to be deployed on a per-
            interface basis as well as globally per-PE, per-VPLS 
            instance.
    3. The protection mechanism MUST have no dependencies to the extent 
            to which it may or may not be deployed on other interfaces,
            other PEs, or other VPLS instances, except for necessary 
            hardware limitations on the number of interfaces 
            consecutively supported per device.
    4. The protection mechanism MUST NOT require a topographical view 
            of the network. i.e. Any protocol solution MUST NOT have any
            stateful dependancies.
    5. The protection mechanism MUST NOT alter or be dependent upon 
            other frames transmitted within the layer-2 broadcast 
            domain.
    6. The protection mechanism MUST NOT restrict or in any way   
            interfere with the operation of other protocols deployed 
            within the layer-2 broadcast domain, including other layer-2 
            loop protection mechanisms except for when a loop-
            condition is detected and the configured action has indirect 
            affects.
    7. The protection mechanism MUST provide per-VPLS instance and per-
            interface level configurable parameters for protection 
            options and loop-condition actions.
    8. The protection mechanism MUST provide the following 
            loop-condition actions related to the layer-2 segment where 
            the loop is detected: 
                   isolate it from the VPLS instance; 
                   prevent broadcast traffic entering the VPLS instance; 
                   stop MAC-Learning;
                   send an SNMP trap message;
                   create a syslog message.
            These actions should be configurable in isolation and/or in 
            conjunction with each other where logic permits.
    9.  The protection mechanism must allow for clear identification of 
            any specific protocol frames for network forensic 
            accountability.
   10.  The protection mechanism MUST have no dependancies on other
            protocols.

5. Existing Vendor Functions

    At the time of writing there is one proprietary vendor 
    implementation that attempts to address this issue. This feature 
    works by recognizing the learning of a MAC-Address on an interface 
    that is different to an interface on which it was previously learnt. 
    Although useful this feature addresses the issue from a MAC-Learning 
    of customer traffic and is susceptible to false-positives. It also 
    is reliant upon customer traffic and MAC-Learning of all customer 
    frames. This is in violation of requirement 5 in Section 4.

    There is also a non-vendor written script for another vendor 
    Operating Software that functions in a similar way and thus has 
    the same drawbacks.

6. Security Considerations

    The security considerations are as follows:

6.1 False Positives

    The solution MUST account for and protect against action due to a
    false loop-condition to an extent that is reasonable to expect 
    within the scope and expected normal operation of the service.

6.2 Malicious Trigger

    The solution MUST account for and protect against action due to the
    malicious attempt to trigger a false loop-condition to an extent 
    that is reasonable to expect within the scope of expected security 
    best-practice for the service.

7. IANA Considerations

    None.
