                 UDP Checksum Trailer in Timing Protocols
               draft-mizrahi-tictoc-checksum-trailer-00.txt


Abstract

   Various time synchronization and delay measurement protocols are
   transported over UDP, e.g., PTP, NTP, and OWAMP/TWAMP. These
   protocols use timestamped packets that often have to be modified by
   intermediate nodes in the network. In such cases the UDP checksum
   field must be updated to reflect these modifications. The IEEE 1588
   standard suggests to append 2 octets to every protocol message,
   allowing intermediate nodes to reflect the checksum modification in
   the last 2 octets rather than in the UDP checksum field. This
   document generalizes this concept, and defines a UDP Checksum Trailer
   for NTP and for OWAMP/TWAMP.

1. Introduction

   Various timing protocols are used for time synchronization and delay
   measurement. Some of these protocols are transported over the User
   Datagram Protocol ([UDP]).

Internet-Draft          UDP Checksum Trailer                 July 2011


   Specifically, this document discusses the following timing protocols:

   o The Network Time Protocol (NTP), as defined in [NTPv4] and in
      previous versions of this protocol.

   o The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol ([OWAMP]) and the Two-Way
      Active Measurement Protocol ([TWAMP]).

   o The Precision Time Protocol (PTP), as defined in [IEEE 1588].

   Timing protocols sometimes require an intermediate node to assign or
   to change a timestamp in the packet payload. An intermediate node in
   the context of this document is one of two possible entities:

   o Transparent Clocks (TC) in PTP are intermediate nodes in the
      network that update a "Correction Field" in the PTP packet by
      adding the latency caused by the current TC. There is no
      equivalent entity in NTP and OWAMP/TWAMP.

   o A transmitting node in a timing protocol may consist of several
      modules or blocks. For example, it may consist of a CPU and an
      ASIC, where protocol packets are typically generated by the CPU,
      and timestamps are added by the ASIC. In such cases, the ASIC is
      referred to as an intermediate node in the context of this
      document.

   When the UDP payload is changed by an intermediate node, the UDP
   Checksum field must be updated to maintain its correctness. When
   using UDP over IPv4 ([UDP]), an intermediate node that cannot update
   the value of the UDP checksum can assign a value of zero to the
   checksum field, causing the receiver to ignore the checksum field.
   UDP over IPv6, as defined in [IPv6], does not allow a zero checksum,
   and requires the UDP checksum field to contain a correct checksum of
   the UDP payload.

   Since an intermediate node only modifies a specific field in the
   packet, i.e. the timestamp field, the UDP checksum update can be
   performed incrementally, using the concepts presented in [Checksum].

   Annex E of [IEEE 1588] defines that in PTP over IPv6 packets two
   octets are appended to the end of the PTP payload for UDP checksum
   updates. The value of these two octets can be updated by an
   intermediate node, causing the value of the UDP checksum field to
   remain correct.

Internet-Draft          UDP Checksum Trailer                 July 2011


   The term Checksum Trailer is used throughout this document and refers
   to the 2 octets at the end of the UDP payload, used for updating the
   UDP checksum by intermediate nodes.

   The usage of the Checksum Trailer may in some cases simplify the
   implementation, since if the packet data is processed in a serial
   order, it is simpler to first update the timestamp field, and then
   update the Checksum Trailer rather than to update the timestamp and
   then update the UDP checksum, residing at the UDP header.

   This document generalizes the concept presented in Annex E of [IEEE
   1588] defines the Checksum Trailer for NTP and for OWAMP / TWAMP.

4. UDP Checksum Trailer

4.1. Overview

   The UDP Checksum Trailer is a two-octet trailer that is appended to
   the end of the UDP payload. The Length field in the UDP header counts
   the number of octets in the UDP header and payload, including the
   Checksum Trailer.

4.2. NTP

   NTP is transported over UDP, either over IPv4 or over IPv6. This
   section applies to both NTP over IPv4, and NTP over IPv6.

   NTP packets may include one or more extension fields, as defined in
   [NTPv4]. The Checksum Trailer in NTP packets resides in a dedicated
   NTP extension field, as shown in Figure 2.

   If the NTP packet includes more than one extension field, the
   Checksum Trailer extension is always the last extension field. Thus,
   when NTP authentication is disabled, the Checksum Trailer is the last
   2 octets in the UDP payload, and thus the trailer is located at UDP
   Length - 2 octets after the beginning of the UDP header. When NTP
   authentication is enabled, the Checksum Trailer is the last 2 octets
   before the Key Identifier.

   Field Type

     A dedicated Field Type value is used to identify the Checksum
      Trailer extension. See Section 6 for further details.

   Length

     The Checksum Trailer extension field length is the minimal
      extension field length defined in [NTPv4], which is 16 octets.

   Padding

     The extension field includes 6 octets of padding. This field
      SHOULD be set to 0, and SHOULD be ignored by the recipient.

   Checksum Trailer

     Includes the UDP Checksum Trailer field.

4.2.1. Transmission of NTP with Checksum Trailer

   The transmitter of an NTP packet MAY include a Checksum Trailer
   extension field.

4.2.2. Intermediate Updates of NTP with Checksum Trailer

   An intermediate node that receives and alters an NTP packet
   containing a Checksum Trailer extension MAY alter the Checksum
   Trailer in order to maintain a correct UDP checksum value.

4.2.3. Reception of NTP with Checksum Trailer

   This document does not impose new requirements on the receiving end
   of an NTP packet.

   The UDP layer at the receiving end verifies the UDP Checksum of
   received NTP packets, and the NTP layer SHOULD ignore the Checksum
   Trailer extension field.

4.3. OWAMP / TWAMP

   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol ([OWAMP]), and the Two-Way
   Active Measurement Protocol ([TWAMP]) both make use of timestamped
   test packets. The test packet format is defined in [OWAMP].

   This document refers to OWAMP and TWAMP alike, but the rest of this
   section refers only to OWAMP for short.

   OWAMP is transported over UDP, either over IPv4 or over IPv6. This
   section applies to both OWAMP over IPv4, and OWAMP over IPv6.

   OWAMP test packets contain a Packet Padding field. The Checksum
   Trailer in OWAMP packets resides in the last 2 octets of the Packet
   Padding field. Therefore, the Checksum Trailer is always the last 2
   octets in the UDP payload, and thus the trailer is located at UDP
   Length - 2 octets after the beginning of the UDP header.

              Figure 3 Checksum Trailer in OWAMP Test Packets

   In OWAMP, the length of the Packet Padding field is announced during
   the session initiation through the "Padding Length" field in the
   Request-Session message. When a Checksum Trailer is included, the
   "Padding Length" is the length of the padding including the Checksum
   Trailer.

4.3.1. Transmission of OWAMP with Checksum Trailer

   The transmitter of an OWAMP test packet MAY include a Checksum
   Trailer field, incorporated in the last 2 octets of the Packet
   Padding.

   A transmitter that includes a Checksum Trailer in its outgoing OWAMP
   test packets MUST include a Packet Padding in OWAMP test packets,
   whose length is at least 2 octets.

Internet-Draft          UDP Checksum Trailer                 July 2011


4.3.2. Intermediate Updates of OWAMP with Checksum Trailer

   An intermediate node that receives and alters an OWAMP test packet
   MAY alter the Checksum Trailer in order to maintain a correct UDP
   checksum value.

4.3.3. Reception of OWAMP with Checksum Trailer

   This document does not impose new requirements on the receiving end
   of an OWAMP packet.

   The UDP layer at the receiving end verifies the UDP Checksum of
   received OWAMP packets, and the OWAMP layer SHOULD treat the Checksum
   Trailer as part of the Packet Padding.

4.4. PTP

   The behavior of PTP over UDP is defined in [IEEE 1588], and is
   described here as an informational section, for the sake of
   completeness.

4.4.1. PTP over IPv6

   Annex E of [IEEE 1588] defines the transport of PTP messages over
   UDP-over-IPv6. The transmitter of PTP over IPv6 extends the payload
   of the PTP messages by two octets. These two octets can be used by
   intermediate nodes as a Checksum Trailer.

   The Checksum Trailer is always the last 2 octets in the UDP payload,
   and thus the trailer is located at UDP Length - 2 octets after the
   beginning of the UDP header.

4.4.2. PTP over IPv4

   When PTP is transported over UDP-over-IPv4, intermediate nodes that
   alter the packet can either update the UDP checksum or clear its
   value to 0, causing subsequent nodes to ignore the checksum field.

   A Checksum Trailer is currently not defined for PTP over IPv4.

4.5. Interoperability with Existing Implementations

   The behavior defined in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 for NTP and OWAMP does
   not impose new requirements on receiving nodes. Thus, transmitters
   and intermediate nodes that support the Checksum Trailer can
   transparently interoperate with existing implementations.

5. Security Considerations

   This document discusses timing protocol packets that are altered by
   intermediate nodes in the network. When message Authentication is
   used, intermediate nodes that alter the packet must also re-compute
   the MAC accordingly. If the protocol packets are encrypted,
   intermediate nodes must decrypt, modify, and then re-encrypt the
   packets.

   Otherwise, the concepts in this document are applicable to secure
   timing packets.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate an NTP extension Field Type value for
   the Checksum Trailer extension.
