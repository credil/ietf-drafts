        <t>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol almost exclusively used in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains. Due to this central nature, it's important to understand the security measures that can and should be deployed to prevent accidental or intentional routing disturbances.</t>
        <t>This document describes measures to protect the BGP sessions itself (like TTL, MD5, control plane filtering) and to better control the flow of routing information, using prefix filtering and automatization of prefix filters, max-prefix filtering, AS path filtering, route flap dampening and BGP community scrubbing.</t>

This protocol does not directly include mechanisms that control that routes exchanged conform to the various rules defined by the Internet community. This document intends to both summarize common existing rules and help network administrators apply coherent BGP policies.</t>

    <section anchor="RouterProtection" title="Protection of the BGP router">
        <t>The BGP router needs to be protected from stray packets. This protection should be achieved by an access-list (ACL) which would discard all packets directed to TCP port 179 on the local device and sourced from an address not known or permitted to become a BGP neighbor. If supported, an ACL specific to the control-plane of the router should be used (receive-ACL, control-plane policing, etc.), to avoid filtering transit traffic if not needed. If the hardware can not do that, interface ACLs can be used to block packets to the local router.</t>
        <t>Some routers automatically program such an ACL upon BGP configuration. On other devices this ACL should be configured and maintained manually or using scripts.</t>
        <t>The filtering of packets destined to the local router is a wider topic than "just for BGP" (if you bring down a router by overloading one of the other protocols from remote, BGP is harmed as well). For a more detailed recommendation, see <xref target="RFC6192">RFC6192</xref>.</t>
    </section>


    <section anchor="SessionProtection" title="Protection of BGP sessions">

      <section anchor="SessionProtectionMD5" title="Protection of TCP sessions used by BGP">
        <t>Attacks on TCP sessions used by BGP (ex: sending spoofed TCP RST packets) could bring down the TCP session. Following a successful ARP spoofing attack (or other similar Man-in-the-Middle attack), the attacker might even be able to inject packets into the TCP stream (routing attacks).</t>
        <t>TCP sessions used by BGP can be secured with a variety of mechanisms. MD5 protection of TCP session header <xref target="RFC2385" /> is the most common one, but one could also use IPsec or TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO, <xref target="RFC5925" />).</t>
        <t>The drawback of TCP session protection is additional configuration and management overhead for authentication information (ex: MD5 password) maintenance. Protection of TCP sessions used by BGP is thus recommended when peerings are established over shared networks where spoofing can be done (like IXPs).</t>
        <t>You SHOULD block spoofed packets (packets with a source IP address belonging to your IP address space) at all edges of your network, making the protection of TCP sessions used by BGP unnecessary on iBGP or eBGP sessions run over point-to-point links.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="SessionProtectionTTL" title="BGP TTL security">
        <t>BGP sessions can be made harder to spoof with the TTL security <xref target="RFC5082" />. Instead of sending TCP packets with TTL value = 1, the routers send the TCP packets with TTL value = 255 and the receiver checks that the TTL value equals 255. Since it's impossible to send an IP packet with TTL = 255 to a non-directly-connected IP host, BGP TTL security effectively prevents all spoofing attacks coming from third parties not directly connected to the same subnet as the BGP-speaking routers. Network administrators SHOULD implement TTL security on directly connected BGP peerings.</t>
        <t>Note: Like MD5 protection, TTL security has to be configured on both ends of a BGP session.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="PrefixFiltering" title="Prefix filtering">
      <t>The main aspect of securing BGP resides in controlling the prefixes that are received/advertised on the BGP peerings. Prefixes exchanged between BGP peers are controlled with inbound and outbound filters that can match on IP prefixes (prefix filters, <xref target="PrefixFiltering" />), AS paths (as-path filters, <xref target="ASpathFilters" />) or any other attributes of a BGP prefix (for example, BGP communities, <xref target="CommunityFilters" />).</t>

      <section anchor="PrefixFilteringDefinition" title="Definition of prefix filters">
        <t>This section list the most commonly used prefix filters. Following sections will clarify where these filters should be applied.</t>

        <section anchor="PrefixFilteringNoRoute" title="Prefixes that MUST not be routed by definition">

          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringNoRouteIPv4" title="IPv4">
            <t>At the time of the writing of this document, there is no dynamic IPv4 registry listing special prefixes and their status on the internet. On the other hand static document <xref target="RFC5735">RFC5735</xref> clarifies "special" IPv4 prefixes and their status in the Internet. One should note that <xref target="RFC5735">RFC5735</xref> has been updated by <xref target="RFC6598">RFC6598</xref> which adds a new prefix to the ones that MUST NOT be routed across network boundaries.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringNoRouteIPv6" title="IPv6">
            <t>IPv6 registry <xref target="IANAipv6SpecialPurposeRegistry" /> maintains the list of IPv6 special purpose prefixes and their routing scope. Reader will refer to this registry in order to configure prefix filters.</t>
            <t>At the time of the writing of this document, the list of IPv6 prefixes that MUST not cross network boundaries can be simplified as IANA allocates at the time being prefixes to RIR's only in 2000::/3 prefix <xref target="IANAipv6AddressSpace" />. All other prefixes (ULA's, link-local, multicast… are outside of that prefix) and therefore the simplified list becomes:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>2001:DB8::/32 and more specifics - documentation <xref target="RFC3849" /></t>
              <t>Prefixes more specifics than 2002::/16 - 6to4 <xref target="RFC3056" /></t>
              <t>3FFE::/16 and more specifics - was initially used for the 6Bone (worldwide IPv6 test network) and returned to IANA</t>
              <t>All prefixes that are outside 2000::/3 prefix</t>
            </list></t>
          </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="PrefixFilteringNotAllocated" title="Prefixes not allocated">
          <t>IANA allocates prefixes to RIRs which in turn allocate prefixes to LIRs. It is wise not to accept in the routing table prefixes that are not allocated. This could mean allocation made by IANA and/or allocations done by RIRs. This section details the options for building a list of allocated prefixes at every level. It is important to understand that filtering prefixes not allocated requires constant updates as prefixes are continually allocated. Therefore automation of such prefix filters is key for the success of this approach. One should probably not consider solutions described in this section if it is not capable of maintaining updated prefix filters: the damage would probably be worse than the intended security policy.</t>

          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringNotAllocatedIANA" title="IANA allocated prefix filters">
            <t>IANA has allocated all the IPv4 available space. Therefore there is no reason why one would keep checking prefixes are in the <xref target="IANAipv4AllocatedPrefixes">IANA allocated address space</xref>. No specific filters need to be put in place by administrators who want to make sure that IPv4 prefixes they receive have been allocated by IANA.</t>
            <t>For IPv6, given the size of the address space, it can be seen as wise accepting only prefixes derived from those allocated by IANA. Administrators can dynamically build this list from the <xref target="IANAipv6AllocatedPrefixes">IANA allocated IPv6 space</xref>. As IANA keeps allocating prefixes to RIRs, the aforementioned list should be checked regularly against changes and if they occur, prefix filters should be computed and pushed on network devices. As there is delay between the time a RIR receives a new prefix and the moment it starts allocating portions of it to its LIRs, there is no need doing this step quickly and frequently. Based on past experience, authors recommend that the process in place makes sure there is no more than one month between the time the IANA IPv6 allocated prefix list changes and the moment all IPv6 prefix filters are updated.</t>
            <t>If process in place (manual or automatic) cannot guarantee that the list is updated regularly then it's better not to configure any filters based on allocated networks. The IPv4 experience has shown that many network operators implemented filters for prefixes not allocated by IANA but did not update them on a regular basis. This created problems for latest allocations and required a extra work for RIRs that had to "de-bogonize" the newly allocated prefixes.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringNotAllocatedRIR" title="RIR allocated prefix filters">
            <t>A more precise check can be performed as one would like to make sure that prefixes they receive are being originated or transited by autonomous systems entitled to do so. It has been observed in the past that one could easily advertise someone else's prefix (or more specific prefixes) and create black holes or security threats. To overcome that risk, administrators would need to make sure BGP advertisements correspond to information located in the existing registries. At this stage 2 options can be considered (short and long term options). They are described in the following subsections.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringNotAllocatedIRR" title="Prefix filters creation from Internet Routing Registries (IRR)">
            <t>An Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is a database containing internet routing information, described using Routing Policy Specification Language objects <xref target="RFC4012" />. Network administrators are given privileges to describe routing policies of their own networks in the IRR and information is published, usually publicly. Most of Regional Internet Registries do also operate an IRR and can control that registered routes conform to prefixes allocated or directly assigned.</t>
            <t>It is possible to use the IRR information to build, for a given neighbor autonomous system, a list of prefixes originated or transited which one may accept. This can be done relatively easily using scripts and existing tools capable of retrieving this information in the registries. This approach is exactly the same for both IPv4 and IPv6.</t>
            <t>The macro-algorithm for the script is described as follows. For the peer that is considered, the distant network administrator has provided the autonomous system and may be able to provide an AS-SET object (aka AS-MACRO). An AS-SET is an object which contains AS numbers or other AS-SETs. An operator may create an AS-SET defining all the AS numbers of its customers. A tier 1 transit provider might create an AS-SET describing the AS-SET of connected operators, which in turn describe the AS numbers of their customers. Using recursion, it is possible to retrieve from an AS-SET the complete list of AS numbers that the peer is likely to announce. For each of these AS numbers, it is also easy to check in the corresponding IRR for all associated prefixes. With these two mechanisms a script can build for a given peer the list of allowed prefixes and the AS number from which they should be originated. One could decide not use the origin information and only build monolithic prefix filters from fetched data.</t>
            <t>As prefixes, AS numbers and AS-SETs may not all be under the same RIR authority, a difficulty resides choosing for each object the appropriate IRR to poll. Some IRRs have been created and are not restricted to a given region or authoritative RIR. They allow RIRs to publish information contained in their IRR in a common place. They also make it possible for any subscriber (probably under contract) to publish information too. When doing requests inside such an IRR, it is possible to specify the source of information in order to have the most reliable data. One could check a popular IRR containing many sources (such as <xref target="RADB">RADB</xref>, the Routing Assets Database) and only use information from sources representing the five current RIRs.</t>
            <t>As objects in IRRs may quickly vary over time, it is important that prefix filters computed using this mechanism are refreshed regularly. A daily basis could even been considered as some routing changes must be done sometimes in a certain emergency and registries may be updated at the very last moment. It has to be noted that this approach significantly increases the complexity of the router configurations as it can quickly add tens of thousands configuration lines for some important peers.</t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="PrefixFilteringNotAllocatedRIRsidr" title="SIDR - Secure Inter Domain Routing">
              <t>IETF has created a working group called SIDR (Secure Inter-Domain Routing) in order to create an architecture to secure internet advertisements. At the time this document is written, many documents have been published and a framework is proposed so that advertisements can be checked against signed routing objects in RIR routing registries. Implementing mechanisms proposed by this working group is expected to solve many of these BGP routing security problems in the long term. But as it may take time for deployments to be made and objects to become signed, such a solution will need to be combined with the other mechanisms detailed in this document. The rest of this section assumes the reader is familiar with SIDR technologies.</t>
              <t>Each received route on a router SHOULD be checked against the RPKI data set: if a corresponding ROA is found and is valid then the prefix SHOULD be accepted. It the ROA is found and is INVALID then the prefix SHOULD be discarded. If an ROA is not found then the prefix SHOULD be accepted but corresponding route SHOULD be given a low preference.</t>
            </section>

        </section>

        <section anchor="PrefixFilteringTooSpecific" title="Prefixes too specific">
          <t>Most ISPs will not accept advertisements beyond a certain level of specificity (and in return do not announce prefixes they consider as too specific). That acceptable specificity is decided for each peering between the 2 BGP peers. Some ISP communities have tried to document acceptable specificity. This document does not make any judgement on what the best approach is, it just recalls that there are existing practices on the internet and recommends the reader to refer to what those are. As an example the RIPE community has documented that IPv4 prefixes longer than /24 and IPv6 prefixes longer than /48 are generally not announced/accepted in the internet <xref target="RIPE-399" /> <xref target="RIPE-532" />.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="PrefixFilteringSelfPrefixes" title="Filtering prefixes belonging to the local AS">
          <t>A network SHOULD filter its own prefixes on peerings with all its peers (inbound direction). This prevents local traffic (from a local source to a local destination) from leaking over an external peering in case someone else is announcing the prefix over the Internet. This also protects the infrastructure which may directly suffer in case backbone's prefix is suddenly preferred over the Internet. To an extent, such filters can also be configured on a network for the prefixes of its downstreams in order to protect them too. Such filters must be defined with caution as they can break existing redundancy mechanisms. For example in case an operator has a multihomed customer, it should keep accepting the customer prefix from its peers and upstreams. This will make it possible for the customer to keep accessing its operator network (and other customers) via the internet in case the BGP peering between the customer and the operator is down.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="PrefixFilteringExchangePoint" title="IXP LAN prefixes">
          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringExchangePointNetworkSecurity" title="Network security">
            <t>When a network is present on an IXP and peers with other IXP members over a common subnet (IXP LAN prefix), it MUST NOT accept more specific prefixes for the IXP LAN prefix from any of its external BGP peers. Accepting these routes may create a black hole for connectivity to the IXP LAN.</t>
            <t>If the IXP LAN prefix is accepted as an "exact match", care needs to be taken to avoid other routers in the network sending IXP traffic towards the externally-learned IXP LAN prefix (recursive route lookup pointing into the wrong direction).  This can be achieved by preferring IGP routes before eBGP, or by using "BGP next-hop-self" on all routes learned on that IXP.</t>
            <t>If the IXP LAN prefix is accepted at all, it MUST only be accepted from the ASes that the IXP authorizes to announce it - which will usually be automatically achieved by filtering announcements by IRR DB.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringExchangePointPMTUD" title="pMTUd and the loose uRPF problem"> 
            <t>In order to have pMTUd working in the presence of loose uRPF, it is necessary that all the networks that may source traffic that could flow through the IXP (ie. IXP members and their downstreams) have a route for the IXP LAN prefix. This is necessary as "packet too big" ICMP messages sent by IXP members' routers may be sourced using an address of the IXP LAN prefix. In the presence of loose uRPF, this ICMP packet is dropped if there is no route for the IXP LAN prefix or a less specific route covering IXP LAN prefix.</t>
            <t>In that case, any IXP member SHOULD make sure it has a route for the IXP LAN prefix or a less specific prefix on all its routers and that it announces the IXP LAN prefix or less specific (up to a default route) to its downstreams. The announcements done for this purpose SHOULD pass IRR-generated filters described in <xref target="PrefixFilteringNotAllocatedIRR" /> as well as "prefixes too specific" filters described in <xref target="PrefixFilteringTooSpecific" />. The easiest way to implement this is that the IXP itself takes care of the origination of its prefix and advertises it to all IXP members through a BGP peering. Most likely the BGP route servers would be used for this. The IXP would most likely send its entire prefix which would be equal or less specific than the IXP LAN prefix.</t>
          </section>
 
          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringExchangePointExample" title="Example">   
             <t>Let's take as an example an IXP in the RIPE region for IPv4. It would be allocated a /22 by RIPE NCC (X.Y.0.0/22 in our example) and use a /23 of this /22 for the IXP LAN (let say X.Y.0.0/23).

             <t>Any IXP member MUST make sure it filters prefixes more specific than X.Y.0.0/23 from all its eBGP peers. If it received X.Y.0.0/24 or X.Y.1.0/24 this could seriously impact its routing.</t>
             <t>The IXP SHOULD originate X.Y.0.0/22 and advertise it to its members through an eBGP peering (most likely from its BGP route servers, configured with AS64496).</t>
             <t>The IXP members SHOULD accept the IXP prefix only if it passes the IRR generated filters (see <xref target="PrefixFilteringNotAllocatedIRR" />)</t>
             <t>IXP members SHOULD then advertise X.Y.0.0/22 prefix to their downstreams. This announce would pass IRR based filters as it is originated by the IXP.</t>

        <t>For networks that have the full internet BGP table, some policies should be applied on each BGP peer for received and advertised routes.

          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringCustomersInbound" title="Inbound filtering">
            <t>The inbound policy with end customers is pretty straightforward: only customers prefixes must be accepted, all others MUST be discarded. The list of accepted prefixes can be manually specified, after having verified that they are valid. This validation can be done with the appropriate IP address management authorities.</t>
            <t>The same rules apply in case the customer is also a network connecting other customers (for example a tier 1 transit provider connecting service providers). An exception can be envisaged in case it is known that the customer network applies strict inbound/outbound prefix filtering, and the number of prefixes announced by that network is too large to list them in the router configuration. In that case filters as in <xref target="PrefixFilteringInternetPeersInbound" /> can be applied.</t>
          </section>

          <section anchor="PrefixFilteringCustomersOutbound" title="Outbound filtering">
            <t>The outbound policy with customers may vary according to the routes customer wants to receive. In the simplest possible scenario, the customer may only want to receive only the default route, which can be done easily by applying a filter with the default route only.</t>
            <t>In case the customer wants to receive the full routing (in case it is multihomed or if wants to have a view of the internet table), the following filters can be simply applied on the BGP peering:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t><xref target="PrefixFilteringNoRoute">Prefixes not routable</xref></t>

            <t>There can be a difference for the default route that can be announced to the customer in addition to the full BGP table. This can be done simply by removing the filter for the default route. As the default route may not be present in the routing table, one may decide to originate it only for peerings where it has to be advertised.</t>

    <section anchor="RouteFlapDampening" title="BGP route flap dampening">
      <t>The BGP route flap dampening mechanism makes it possible to give penalties to routes each time they change in the BGP routing table. Initially this mechanism was created to protect the entire internet from multiple events impacting a single network. Studies have shown that implementations of BGP route flap dampening could cause more harm than they solve problems and therefore RIPE community has in the past recommended not using BGP route flap dampening <xref target="RIPE-378" />. Works have then been conducted to propose new route flap dampening thresholds in order to make the solution "usable" <xref target="RFDusable" /> and RIPE has reviewed its recommendations in <xref target="RIPE-580" />. New thresholds have been proposed to make BGP route flap dampening usable. Authors of this document propose to follow RIPE recommendations and only use BGP route flap dampening with adjusted configured thresholds.</t>

    <section anchor="MaximumPrefixes" title="Maximum prefixes on a peering">
      <t>It is recommended to configure a limit on the number of routes to be accepted from a peer. Following rules are generally recommended:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>From peers, it is recommended to have a limit lower than the number of routes in the internet. This will shut down the BGP peering if the peer suddenly advertises the full table. One can also configure different limits for each peer, according to the number of routes they are supposed to advertise plus some headroom to permit growth.</t>
        <t>From upstreams which provide full routing, it is recommended to have a limit higher than the number of routes in the internet. A limit is still useful in order to protect the network (and in particular the routers' memory) if too many routes are sent by the upstream. The limit should be chosen according to the number of routes that can actually be handled by routers.</t>
      </list>
      It is important to regularly review the limits that are configured as the internet can quickly change over time. Some vendors propose mechanisms to have two thresholds: while the higher number specified will shutdown the peering, the first threshold will only trigger a log and can be used to passively adjust limits based on observations made on the network.</t>

    <section anchor="ASpathFilters" title="AS-path filtering">
      <t>The following rules SHOULD be applied on BGP AS-paths (for both 16 and 32 bits Autonomous System Numbers):
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>From customers, try to accept only AS(4)-Paths containing ASNs belonging to (or authorized to transit through) the customer. If you can not build and generate filtering expressions to implement this, consider accepting only path lengths relevant to the type of customer you have (as in, if they are a leaf or have customers of their own), try to discourage excessive prepending in such paths.</t>
        <t>Do not advertise prefixes with non-empty AS-path if you do not intend to be transit for these prefixes.</t>
        <t>Do not advertise prefixes with upstream AS numbers in the AS-path to your peering AS if you do not intend to be transit for these prefixes.</t>
        <t>Do not accept prefixes with private AS numbers in the AS-path except from customers. Exception: an upstream offering some particular service like black-hole origination based on a private AS number. Customers should be informed by their upstream in order to put in place ad-hoc policy to use such services.</t>
        <t>Do not advertise prefixes with private AS numbers in the AS-path. Exception: customers using BGP without having their own AS number must use private AS numbers to advertise their prefixes to their upstream. The private AS number is usually provided by the upstream.</t>
        <t>Do not accept prefixes when the first AS number in the AS-path is not the one of the peer. In case the peering is done toward a BGP route-server <xref target="RouteServer" /> (connection on an IXP) with transparent AS path handling, this verification needs to be de-activated as the first AS number will be the one of an IXP member whereas the peer AS number will be the one of the BGP route-server.</t>
        <t>Don't override BGP's default behavior accepting your own AS number in the AS-path. In case an exception to this is required, impacts should be studied carefully as this can create severe impact on routing.</t>

    <section anchor="NextHopFilters" title="Next-Hop Filtering">
        <t>If peering on a shared network, like an IXP, BGP can advertise prefixes with a 3rd-party next-hop, thus directing packets not to the peer announcing the prefix but somewhere else.</t>
        <t>This is a desirable property for BGP route-server setups <xref target="RouteServer" />, where the route-server will relay routing information, but has neither capacity nor desire to receive the actual data packets. So the BGP route-server will announce prefixes with a next-hop setting pointing to the router that originally announced the prefix to the route-server.</t>
        <t>In direct peerings between ISPs, this is undesirable, as one of the peers could trick the other one to send packets into a black hole (unreachable next-hop) or to an unsuspecting 3rd party who would then have to carry the traffic. Especially for black-holing, the root cause of the problem is hard to see without inspecting BGP prefixes at the receiving router at the IXP.</t>
        <t>Therefore, an inbound route policy SHOULD be applied on IXP peerings in order to set the next-hop for accepted prefixes to the BGP peer IP address (belonging to the IXP LAN) that sent the prefix (which is what "next-hop-self" would enforce on the sending side).</t>
        <t>This policy MUST NOT be used on route-server peerings, or on peerings where you intentionally permit the other side to send 3rd-party next-hops.</t>
        <t>This policy also MUST be adjusted if Remote Triggered Black Holing best practice (aka RTBH <xref target="RFC6666" />) is implemented. In that case one would apply a well-known BGP next-hop for routes it wants to filter (if an internet threat is observed from/to this route for example). This well known next-hop will be statically routed to a null interface. In combination with unicast RPF check, this will discard traffic from and toward this prefix. Peers can exchange information about black-holes using for example particular BGP communities. One could propagate black-holes information to its peers using agreed BGP community: when receiving a route with that community one could change the next-hop in order to create the black hole.</t>

        <t>Do not remove other communities: your customers might need them to communicate with upstream providers. In particular do not (generally) remove the no-export community as it is usually announced by your peer for a certain purpose.</t>
