This document limits the Domain Name System (DNS) KEY Resource Record
(RR) to only keys used by the Domain Name System Security Extensions
(DNSSEC).  The original KEY RR used sub-typing to store both DNSSEC
keys and arbitrary application keys.  Storing both DNSSEC and
application keys with the same record type is a mistake.  This
document removes application keys from the KEY record by redefining
the Protocol Octet field in the KEY RR Data.  As a result of removing
application keys, all but one of the flags in the KEY record become
unnecessary and are redefined.  Three existing application key
sub-types are changed to reserved, but the format of the KEY record is
not changed.  This document updates RFC 2535.

This document is a product of the DNS Extensions Working Group of the
IETF. 

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
