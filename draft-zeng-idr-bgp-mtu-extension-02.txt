         Maximum Transmission Unit Extended Community for BGP-4
                  draft-zeng-idr-bgp-mtu-extension-02

Abstract

   Proper functioning of path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) discovery
   [RFC1191] requires that IP routers have knowledge of the MTU for each
   link to which they are connected.  As MPLS progresses, [RFC3988]
   specifies extensions to LDP in support of LDP LSP MTU discovery.  For
   the LSP created using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC3107], it
   does not have the ability to signal the path MTU to the ingress Label
   Switching Router (LSR).  In the absence of this functionality, the
   MTU for the BGP LSP must be statically configured by network
   operators or by equivalent off-line mechanisms.

   This document defines the MTU Extended Community for BGP in support
   of BGP LSP MTU discovery.

Internet-Draft      MTU Extended Community for BGP-4          March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Proper functioning of [RFC1191] path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
   discovery requires that IP routers have knowledge of the MTU for each
   link to which they are connected.  As MPLS progresses, [RFC3988]
   specifies some extensions to LDP in support of LDP LSP MTU discovery.
   For the LSP created using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC3107], it
   does not have the ability to signal the path MTU to the ingress Label
   Switching Router (LSR).  Without knowledge of the path MTU of the
   whole BGP LSP, ingress BGP LSRs may transmit packets along that LSP
   which are either too big or too small, thus these packets may either
   be silently discarded by LSRs or be transmitted inefficiently.  In
   the absence of MTU discovery functionality, the MTU for each BGP LSP
   must be statically configured by network operators or by equivalent
   off-line mechanisms.

   This document defines the MTU Extended Community for BGP in support
   of BGP LSP MTU discovery.


2.  Problem Statement

   For some inter-AS services and also for network scalability, the LSPs
   need to be established using Labeled BGP [RFC3107].  Typical
   scenarios include inter-AS VPN Option C, Carrier's Carrier [RFC4364]
   and Seamless MPLS [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls].

   Taking "Inter-AS IP VPN Option C" as an example.  An ASBR must
   maintain labeled IPv4 /32 routes to the PE routers within its AS.
   And it uses EBGP to distribute these labeled /32 routes to other ASes
   using mechanism in [RFC3107].  ASBRs in transit ASes will also use
   BGP to pass along the labeled /32 routes.  In the AS of ingress PEs
   (from data plane perspective), the labeled /32 routes can be
   distributed to the PE routers using IBGP.  The /32 routes may also be
   redistributed into IGP of the Ingress AS (from data plane
   perspective).  Intra-AS LSPs between the PE nodes and ASBRs can be
   established using LDP [RFC5036] or RSVP-TE [RFC3209].

   For intra-AS LSPs established using LDP or RSVP-TE, Path MTU of the
   LSP could be discovered using mechanisms defined in [RFC3988] and
   [RFC3209] respectively.  But for the inter-AS LSP which is
   established using BGP, some mechanism is needed to discover the Path
   MTU.

Internet-Draft      MTU Extended Community for BGP-4          March 2012


3.1.  Definitions

   BGP LSP Path MTU: The Path MTU of the LSP from a given BGP LSR to a
   specific prefix.  It is carried as a Extended Community with the BGP
   labeled IPv4 (or IPv6) route.  This size includes the IP header and
   data (or other payload) and the part of the label stack that is
   considered payload of this BGP LSP.

   BGP LSR Link MTU: If the two BGP LSRs are directly adjacent, the BGP
   LSR Link MTU is the interface MTU; If the two BGP LSRs are not
   directly adjacent, the BGP LSR Link MTU is the Path MTU of the
   underlying tunnel.  If there are multiple links between the two BGP
   LSRs, the BGP LSR Link MTU is the minimum of those link MTUs.

3.2.  MTU Extended Community

   BGP LSP Path MTU is carried in the MTU extended community for BGP-4.
   The MTU extended community is an optional transitive attribute.

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | MTU extended community Type   |        Reserved               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Reserved              |        MTU Value              |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   The MTU extended community type is to be assigned by IANA.  The first
   four octets of the value field should be reserved, and the MTU value
   is carried in the following two octets of the value field.

3.3.  Signaling

   The MTU is advertised hop-by-hop from BGP egress LSR to BGP ingress
   LSR along an BGP LSP.  The steps are as follows:

   A. If BGP speaker A is the originator of the labeled BGP route, and
   there is a intra-AS LSP to the prefix, A SHOULD set its BGP LSP Path
   MTU to the path MTU value it has discovered to this prefix, and
   advertise the labeled BGP route with the MTU Extended Community to
   its BGP Peer (its upstream BGP LSR).  If the prefix belongs to BGP
   speaker A, the BGP LSP Path MTU SHOULD be set to 65535.

   B. BGP speaker B receives the labeled BGP route with BGP LSP Path MTU
   from its BGP peer.

   a) B SHOULD compute the BGP LSR Link MTU to the Next Hop of the
   received message, then sets its BGP LSP Path MTU to the minimum of
   the received BGP LSP Path MTU and (the BGP LSR Link MTU - 4 octets).

   b).  If B distributes the route with the Next Hop attribute
   unchanged, it MUST keep the MTU Extended Community unchanged when
   advertising the message to its upstream BGP LSRs.

   c).  If B would change the Next Hop attribute to itself in the
   subsequent advertisement, it SHOULD set the MTU Extended Community in
   the message with its BGP LSP Path MTU obtained through step a).

3.4.  Considerations on Route Flapping

   Normally change of BGP path attributes would result in advertising a
   BGP update for the route.  In order to throttle the route updates
   caused by changes of BGP path MTU , this section specifies rules of
   route update when BGP LSP Path MTU changes:

   1.  If the BGP LSP Path MTU decreases, a new update SHOULD be
   advertised immediately;

   2.  If the BGP LSP Path MTU increases, the BGP speaker MAY hold down
   the update until there are changes of some other BGP attributes.

3.5.  BGP LSP and LDP LSP Stitching

   In scenarios where the labeled BGP routes are redistributed into IGP
   on a border router and an LDP LSP is established and stitched to the
   BGP LSP, the border router SHOULD use its BGP path MTU as the LDP LSP
   MTU, and the path MTU discovery of the LDP LSP will be performed
   according to [RFC3988].


4.  Applicability Considerations

   The BGP MTU Extended Community is applicable to labeled BGP defined
   in [RFC3107].  The application of BGP MTU Discovery may also be used
   for other inter-AS/inter-area routing scenarios.  Such use cases are
   for further study.

   In order to correctly calculate the path MTU for internal BGP routes,
   an implementation needs to track MTU changes for its underlying
   transport LSPs egressing to the BGP nexthops.

   In order to make full use of this MTU signaling mechanism, data plane
   implementation needs to support route-specific fragmentation based on
   the discovered Path MTU.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a type and sub-type value for BGP MTU
   extended community.


6.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   in [RFC4271].
