     Analysis on Load Balancing Requirement in IPv4/IPv6 Transition
              draft-li-v6ops-load-balancing-requirement-02

Abstract

   This document first analyzes the critical issues of bottlenecks in
   existing tunneling and translation technologies, which can be solved
   by proper load balancing mechanisms(e,g., scalability, availability,
   and single point of failure).  Then, several key factors in designing
   a valid load balancing mechanism are described.  Solutions to
   specific load balancing requirements can be drawn out by considering
   these factors.  At last, current efforts about load balancing are
   introduced.

Internet-Draft   Load Balancing in IPv4/IPv6 Transition     October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Since the depletion of IPv4 address, IPv6 is being introduced into
   existing networks and IPv4 will be gradually replaced by IPv6.

   The Current Internet is almost fully built on IPv4.  IPv6 is
   fundamentally incompatible with IPv4.  The smooth and incremental
   transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is vital to IPv6's success.  IPv6
   transition technologies are generally classified into three
   catigories: dual stack, tunneling (e.g., 6RD[RFC5969], DS-
   Lite[I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite]) and translation (e.g. ,
   NAT64[RFC6146], IVI[RFC6219], BIH[I-D.ietf-behave-v4v6-bih]).

   Dual stack technology can gradually steer traffic from IPv4 network
   to IPv6 network by using the address selection policy that generally
   "IPv6 prior to IPv4", as specified in [RFC3484].

   Both tunneling and translation technologies introduce traffic
   concentration points, the tunnel end-point in tunneling technology
   and the translation gateway in translation technology.  When the
   scope of IPv6 deployment continuously expands and the traffic of IPv6
   business gradually grows, traffic concentration points usually bare
   very heavy work load.  These concentration points will become
   bottlenecks and the sources of the single point of failure.  To
   address such issues,load balancing mechanism should be considered.

   This document firstly analyzes these problems caused by the
   centralized points imposed in the current tunneling and translation
   solutions.  These problems are expected to be solved by proper load
   balancing mechanisms.  Secondly, several key factors in designing
   such load balancing mechanisms are analyzed.  Finally, current
   efforts about load balancing are analyzed and concluded.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is consistent with
   6rd[RFC5969], NAT64[RFC6146], IVI[RFC6219], DS-
   Lite[I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].  Besides, the following
   terminology is defined.

   Load-balancer: A system which distributes users' workload across
   multiple devices providing identical services.

   Target Device: The device to which a load-balancer distributes
   workload.  That is the concentration points of the tunneling and
   translation technologies.

   Selection policy: The Policy by which the load-balancer selects
   target device.

   Transport protocol: The protocol the load balancer uses to delivery
   information of selected target device to user.


4.  Problems of Bottlenecks

   During the coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6, more and more IPv6 traffic
   will be carried on IPv4 network or IPv4 Internet in the form of 6in4
   tunnel such as 6RD[RFC5969].  Similarly, more and more IPv4 traffic
   will be guided to IPv6 network or IPv6 Internet in the form of 4in6
   tunnel such as DS-Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].  Both DS-
   Lite and 6RD concentrate all the tunnel traffic at the tunnel end-
   points in the service provider network.  These tunnel end-points are
   traffic concentration points which are potential bottlenecks.

   During the evolution from IPv4 to IPv6, IPv6 users will communicate
   with IPv4 network or IPv4 Internet in the form of 6->4 translation
   such as NAT64[RFC6146].  Similarly, some IPv4 users will visit IPv6
   network or IPv6 Internet in the form of 4->6 translation such as
   IVI[RFC6219].  Both NAT64 and IVI convert all the translation traffic
   at the translation gateways in service provider network.  These
   translation gateways are traffic concentration points or potential
   bottlenecks.

   There are many problems about bottlenecks.

   1.  The performance of a single concentration point cannot satisfy
       the increasing workload.

   2.  Drive traffic through roundabout path.

   3.  Involve a single point of failure.

   In order to avoid becoming bottleneck, traffic concentration point
   should be distributed to multiple parallel points.  Each parallel
   point performs the same operations.  There must be some load-
   balancing mechanisms to make parallel points collaborate with one
   another stably, smartly and efficiently.

5.  Keys To the Load-balancing Solutions

   In order to keep transition technology always available when traffic
   growing from small to large scale, some load balancing approaches
   should be applied at IPv4/IPv6 conjunction points.  There are four
   categories requirements for load balancing scheme.  Different
   solutions or mechanisms may be concluded when necessary to meet the
   requirements of each.  The four categories requirements are: Target
   Device, Selection policy, Transport protocol and Load-balancer
   location.

5.1.  Target Device

   As mentioned above, the target device can be tunnel end-point or
   translation gateway in service provider network.

5.1.1.  Tunnel End-Point

   Tunnel End-Point can be stateful (like DS-Lite) or stateless (like
   6RD).  In DS-Lite, such device is AFTR (Address Family Transition
   Router element) which is 4in6 tunnel concentration point and NAPT44
   address port translator.  In 6RD, such device is BR (Border Relay)
   which is only a 6in4 tunnel concentration point.

5.1.2.  Translation Gateway

   Translation Gateway can be stateful (like NAT64) or stateless (like
   IVI).  Either MAY introduce Application Layer Gateway (ALG) into it.
   In NAT64, such device is stateful NAT64 device which is IPv6 to IPv4
   protocol address translator.  In IVI, such device is stateless IVI
   translator which is the mapping and translation gateway.

5.2.  Selection Policy

   [I-D.zhang-behave-nat64-load-balancing] has proposed some kinds of
   prefix64 selection policies for NAT64 load balancing.  Those policies
   can also be applied to general load balancing selection policy in
   addition to Subscriber-Based Policy.

5.2.1.  Anycast-Based Selection Policy

   It requires a load-balancer to select target device according to
   whether target device and involved routers support anycast[RFC4291].

5.2.2.  Source-Based Selection Policy

   It requires a load-balancer to select target device according to the
   IPv6 address of user device.

Internet-Draft   Load Balancing in IPv4/IPv6 Transition     October 2011


5.2.3.  Destination-Based Selection Policy

   It requires a load-balancer to choose target device according to
   e.g., the FQDN, the IPv4/IPv6 address, or other identifiers of
   destination servers.

5.2.4.  Round-Robin Selection Policy

   It requires a load-balancer to select target device and destination
   servers circularly according to the arrival request.

5.2.5.  Subscriber-Based Policy

   It requires a load-balancer to choose target device according to the
   subscriber's information, which can be stored in AAA servers, for
   example.

5.2.6.  Dynamic Selection Policy

   It requires a load-balancer to select target device according to the
   real-time status of target device.

5.3.  Transport Protocol

   According to the selection policy, one or more target devices may be
   chosen by load-balancer.  There are different protocols can be used
   to transport the results to user device.

5.3.1.  DNS

   DNS protocol carries response results to DNS queries.  If result is
   IPv6 address with network specific IPv6 prefix, traffic can be lead
   to relevant translation gateway.  If result is IPv6 address of tunnel
   end-point in service provider network, traffic can be lead to
   relevant tunnel concentration point.

5.3.2.  DHCP

   DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 protocol sends network configuration parameters to
   user device.  The parameters may contain network specific IPv6 prefix
   or tunnel end-point address.

5.3.3.  ICMPv6

   ICMPv6 protocol can broadcast RA (Router Advertisement) message and
   options to user device.  The options may contain network specific
   IPv6 prefix or tunnel end-point address.

Internet-Draft   Load Balancing in IPv4/IPv6 Transition     October 2011


5.3.4.  RADIUS

   RADIUS protocol[RFC2865]] can transport subscriber's information to
   network servers such as DHCP or DNS server.  The subscriber's
   information may contain selected network specific IPv6 prefix or
   tunnel end-point address.  The network servers then can distribute
   the prefix or address to user device.

5.4.  Load-balancer Location

   The load-balancer can be implemented in different locations or
   different devices.

5.4.1.  Terminal/Host

   Terminal/Host can be modified to balance the load to target devices.
   The terminal/host should use the selection policy in 5.2 to choose a
   target device and make its traffic go through it.

5.4.2.  Access Gateway

   Access gateway can be modified to balance the load on target devices.
   The access gateway should use the selection policy in 5.2 to choose a
   target device and make user traffic go through it.

5.4.3.  Network Servers

   Network servers include DHCP server, DNS server, RADIUS server and so
   on.  They should use the selection policy in 5.2 to choose a target
   device.  Then, they delivery the results to user device and user
   device will make its traffic go through the target device.


6.  Where Are We Now

   At present, some transition technologies have specified their own
   load balancing solutions, some transition technologies' load
   balancing solutions are in discussion and the others' are still
   waiting to be focused on.

6.1.  Work Done

6.1.1.  6RD

   Target Device is BR, the tunnel end-point.

   Selection Policy is Anycast.

Internet-Draft   Load Balancing in IPv4/IPv6 Transition     October 2011


   Transport Protocol can be DNS, DHCPv4, PPP, or manual configuration
   etc.  DHCPv4 is recommended in [RFC5969].

   Load-balancer Location is in network server.  DHCPv4 server is
   recommended in [RFC5969].

6.1.2.  BIH

   BIH is described in [I-D.ietf-behave-v4v6-bih].Since BIH is NOT
   REOMMENDED to use together with a NAT64, there is no traffic
   concentration point for the BIH per se.  So BIH does not need any
   load-balancing mechanism.

6.2.  Work In Progress

6.2.1.  NAT64

   Target Device is the NAT64 translator.

   [I-D.xu-behave-stateful-nat-standby] defines a framework for ensuring
   redundancy for stateful Network Address Translators (NAT),including
   NAT44, NAT64 and NAT46, which mainly tries to solve the single point
   of failure problem.  Three redundancy modes are described in the
   document: the cold standby, the hot standby and the partial hot
   standby modes.

   [I-D.zhang-behave-nat64-load-balancing] is considering NAT64 load-
   balancing mechanism.  But no solution is recommended at present.

6.3.  Work To Be Done

6.3.1.  IVI

   Target Device is the IVI translator.

   The load-balancing mechanism is not mentioned in the specification of
   IVI[RFC6219].

6.3.2.  DS-Lite

   Target Device is AFTR, the tunnel end-point.

   Although the load-balancing of AFTR can be done by using the FQDN
   option defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option] and DNS,
   this point is not explicitly described in the specification of DS-
   lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

6.3.3.  4RD

   Target Device is BR, the tunnel end-point.

   The load-balancing mechanism is not mentioned in the specification of
   4RD [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd].


7.  Security Considerations

   The potential security problem should be considered in the specific
   load balancing mechanism designed for the specific transition
   technology.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
