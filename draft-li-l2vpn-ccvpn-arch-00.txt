Abstract

   With the emergence of Software Defined Networks (SDN), the
   architecture of forwarding and control element separation will
   develop faster.  In the central controlled framework, control
   functionality of L2VPN can be done only by the Controllers.
   Consequently it can reduce control functionality in network nodes.
   This document defines the architecture of central controlled L2VPN
   and corresponding protocol extension requirement.

1.  Introduction

   With the development of network technologies, carrier's networks
   become increasingly complex.  New technologies are required to
   integrate traditional switching networks such as ATM and FR networks
   through IP/MPLS networks.  Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) is therefore
   introduced.  MPLS L2VPN transmits Layer 2 VPN services over an MPLS
   network.  MPLS L2VPN enables operators to provide L2VPN services over
   different media, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame
   Relay (FR), virtual local area network (VLAN), Ethernet, and Point-
   to-Point Protocol (PPP) in a unified MPLS network.  Simply, the MPLS
   L2VPN indicates that Layer 2 data is transmitted transparently over
   an MPLS network.  For the users, the MPLS network functions as a
   Layer 2 switched network through which Layer 2 connections can be set
   up between nodes.  Layer 2 connections can be set up in virtual
   leased line (VLL) mode and virtual private LAN service (VPLS) mode.

Internet-Draft         An Architecture of CC L2VPN          October 2013


   With the emergence of Software Defined Networks (SDN), various
   services (e.g. L2VPN, L3VPN, MVPN) have been considered to deploy in
   a central controlled mode.  The architecture of central controlled
   BGP is defined in [I-D.li-idr-cc-bgp-arch].  In the central
   controlled framework, control functionality of L2VPN can be done only
   by the Controllers.  Consequently it can reduce control functionality
   in network nodes.

   This document defines an architecture of Central Controlled L2VPN and
   corresponding protocol extension requirement.

           Figure 1: An Architecture of Central Controlled L2VPN


   The figure above shows the architecture of central controlled L2VPN,
   which consists of two essential network elements: L2VPN Controller
   and Forward Node.  In the architecture, there is no L2VPN related
   control functionality in Forward Nodes.  L2VPN Controller controls
   all the Forward Nodes by download forwarding entries to control the
   forwarding behavior of the node.  L2VPN Controllers need to
   communicate with each other via extension of existing protocols, e.g.
   BGP, LDP, etc.  In this architecture, the L2VPN service set up
   between the forward nodes is proxied by the BGP Controllers.

   The architecture defined in this document applies to VPLS, VPWS.
   Extension to EVPN will be described in a future version.

3.1.  Application Scenarios

   There are three application scenarios for deployment of Central
   Controlled L2VPN service.

   Scenario 1: Partial Deployment

   Some network nodes are upgrading to support Central Controlled L2VPN,
   the other nodes are retained as legacy network nodes.  The new
   network nodes are controlled by L2VPN Controller.  In this scenarios,
   the protocol extensions are applied between the legacy node and the
   controller.

Internet-Draft         An Architecture of CC L2VPN          October 2013


   Scenario 2: Multiple Controller within a Single AS

   In this scenario, there are multiple controllers in a single AS to be
   responsible for setup of Central Controlled L2VPN service.  The
   network will be partitioned into multiple domains in which one
   Central Controller controls a set of nodes.  The protocol extensions
   are applied between the controllers.

   Scenario 3: Multiple Controller within Multiple ASes

   In this scenario, there are multiple controllers in different ASes to
   be responsible for setup of Central Controlled L2VPN service.  Each
   AS has at least one Central Controller.  The protocol extensions
   SHOULD support inter-AS application.

4.  Solutions and Protocol Extensions

4.1.  Overview

   There are two options to implement the architecture of Central
   Controlled L2VPN.

   Option 1:

   Using BGP to distribute label and fulfill the other control
   functionality for central controlled L2VPN service.

   This option can be applied to multiple scenarios.

   Option 2:

   Using LDP to distribute label and fulfill the other control
   functionality for central controlled L2VPN service.

   This option is a transitional manner, mainly being used for
   communicating between legacy network node and L2VPN Controller.

4.2.  PW Establishment

   There are following procedures to set up PW in the Central Controlled
   L2VPN service:

   1.  Auto Discovery: The controller SHOULD advertise the address list
   of Forward Nodes participating in a specific VPLS or VLL to other
   controllers.  After the communication between the controllers, the
   controller can discover the PW that should be set up between the
   Forwarding Nodes controlled by this controller and the Forwarding
   Nodes controlled by other controllers.

Internet-Draft         An Architecture of CC L2VPN          October 2013


   2.  PW Label Allocation: After the process of auto discovery, the
   controller will advertise the label mapping message to the other
   controller for the PW which should be set up between a pair of
   Forward Nodes.  The addresses of the local Forward Node and the
   remote Forward Node SHOULD be carried in the message to differentiate
   the PWs.

   3.  PW Forwarding Entry Creation: When receive the label mapping, the
   controller will find the tunnel to the Forward Node identified by the
   address information of the Local Forwarding Node in the message.
   Then the controller will create PW forwarding entry with PW label and
   the tunnel information and download the forwarding entry to the
   specified Forward Node identified by the address information of the
   remote Forward Node in the message .

4.3.  PW Redundancy

   [RFC4447] defines the PW redundancy mechanism and specifies the PW
   Status TLV to transmit the PW forwarding status.  In the Central
   Controlled L2VPN, when advertise the status for the PW between the
   controllers, the addresses of the Local Forward Node and the Remote
   Forward Node should be carried to specify the specific PW.  The
   similar TLV like PW Status TLV SHOULD also be defined to carry the
   status of the specific PW.

   When the controller receives the message carried the PW status
   information, it will set the PW on the specified Forwarding Node as
   the state specified by the message.

4.4.  MAC Withdraw

   [RFC4762] describes a mechanism to remove MAC addresses that have
   been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster convergence on
   topology change.  The procedure also removes MAC addresses in the
   VPLS that does not require relearning due to such topology change.

   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt] defines an enhancement to the MAC
   Address Withdrawal procedure with empty MAC List [RFC4762], which
   enables a Provider Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses
   that need to be relearned.  Additional extensions to [RFC4762] MAC
   Withdrawal procedures are specified to provide optimized MAC flushing
   for the PBB-VPLS specified in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-vpls-pe-model] .

   For Central Controlled L2VPN, L2VPN Controller needs to develop an
   ability to remove the MAC of the specific Forward Node.  When a
   Forward Node within a L2VPN Controller wants to remove MAC Addresses
   that has been sent to the remote endpoint, the Controller needs to
   send MAC Withdraw Messages on behalf of the Forward Node.  In the

   message, the address of the remote forward node should be carried.
   When the other controller receive the message, it will remove the
   specified MAC addresses on the Forward Node identified by the address
   of the remote forward node in the message.

4.5.  Capability Negotiation

   To ensure backward compatibility with existing implementations, the
   capability for Central Controlled L2VPN SHOULD be negotiated between
   the controllers.  The capability is advertised to each other by the
   controllers.  After the successful negotiation of the capability, the
   other control functionalities for the central controlled L2VPN can be
   done by the controller.
