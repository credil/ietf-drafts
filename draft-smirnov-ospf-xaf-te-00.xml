    <abstract>
      <t>When using Traffic Engineering (TE) in a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
      network the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) TE Label
      Switched Paths (LSP) infrastructure may be duplicated, even if
      the destination IPv4 and IPv6 addresses belong to the same
      remote router. In order to achieve an integrated MPLS TE LSP
      infrastructure, OSPF routes must be computed over MPLS TE
      tunnels created using information propagated in another OSPF
      instance. This is solved by advertising cross-address family
      (X-AF) OSPF TE information.</t>

      <t>This document describes an update to RFC5786 that allows for
      the easy identification of a router's local X-AF IP
      addresses.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>TE Extensions to <xref target="RFC3630">OSPFv2</xref> and to
      <xref target="RFC5329">OSPFv3</xref> have been described to
      support intra-area TE in IPv4 and IPv6 networks,
      respectively. In both cases the TE database provides a tight
      coupling between the routed protocol and TE signaling
      information in it. In other words, any use of the TE link state
      database is limited to IPv4 for <xref target="RFC2328">
      OSPFv2</xref> and IPv6 for <xref target="RFC5340">OSPFv3
      </xref>.</t>

      <t>In a dual stack network it may be desirable to set up common
      MPLS TE LSPs to carry traffic destined to addresses from
      different address families on a router. The use of common LSPs
      eases potential scalability and management concerns by halving
      the number of LSPs in the network. Besides, it allows operators
      to group traffic based on business characteristics and/or
      applications or class of service, not constrained by the network
      protocol which carries it.</t>
      
      <t>For example, an LSP created based on MPLS TE information
      propagated by OSPFv2 instance can be defined to carry both IPv4
      and IPv6 traffic, instead of having multiple LSPs one for each
      address family. Even if in some cases the address
      family-specific traffic is to be separated, the calculation from
      a common database may prove operationally beneficial.</t>
      
      <t>A requirement when creating a common MPLS TE infrastructure
      is the ability to reliably map the X-AF family addresses to the
      corresponding advertising tail-end router. This mapping is a
      challenge because the LSAs containing the routing information
      are carried in one OSPF instance while the TE calculation may be
      done using a TE database from a different instance.</t>
      
      <t>A simple solution to this problem is to rely on the Router ID
      to identify a node in the corresponding OSPFv2 and OSPFv3
      databases. This solution would mandate both instances on the
      same router to be configured with the same Router ID. However,
      relying on the correctness of the configuration puts additional
      burden on network management and adds cost to the operation of
      the network. The network becomes even more difficult to manage
      if OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 topologies do not match exactly, for
      example if area borders are drawn differently in the two
      protocols. Also, if the routing processes do fall out of sync
      (having different Router IDs, even if for local administrative
      reasons), there is no defined way for other routers to discover
      such misalignment and to take any corrective measures (such as
      to avoid routing through affected TE tunnels or issuing warning
      to network management). The use of misaligned router IDs may
      result in delivering the traffic to the wrong tail-end router,
      which could lead to suboptimal routing or even traffic
      loops.</t>
      
      <t>This document describes an update to <xref target="RFC5786"/>
      that allows for the easy identification of a router's local X-AF
      IP addresses. Routers using the <xref target="RFC5786">Node
      Attribute TLV</xref> can include non-TE enabled interface
      addresses in their OSPF TE advertisements, and also use the same
      sub-TLVs to carry X-AF information, facilitating the mapping
      mentioned above.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operation" toc="default">
      <t><xref target="RFC5786"/> defined the Node IPv4 Local Address
      and Node IPv6 Local Address sub-TLVs of the Node Attribute TLV
      for a router to advertise additional local IPv4 and IPv6
      addresses. To solve the problem outlined in <xref
      target="RFC5786"/> OSPFv2 would advertise and use only IPv4
      addresses and OSPFv3 would advertise and use only IPv6
      addresses.</t>
      
      <t>This document updates <xref target="RFC5786"/> so that a
      router can also announce one or more local X-AF addresses using
      the corresponding Local Address sub-TLV. In other words, to
      implement the X-AF routing technique proposed in this document,
      OSPFv2 will advertise the Node IPv6 Local Address sub-TLV and
      OSPFv3 will advertise the Node IPv4 Local Address sub-TLV,
      possibly in addition to advertising other IP addresses as
      documented by <xref target="RFC5786"/>.</t>

      <t>A node that implements X-AF routing SHOULD advertise in the
      corresponding Node Local Address sub-TLV all X-AF IP addresses
      local to the router that can be used by Constrained SPF (CSPF)
      to calculate MPLS TE LSPs. In general, OSPF SHOULD advertise the
      IP address listed in the Router Address TLV of the X-AF instance
      maintaining MPLS TE database plus any additional local addresses
      advertised by the X-AF OSPF instance in its Node Local Address
      sub-TLV. Implementation MAY advertise other local X-AF
      addresses.</t>
      
      <t>If the Node Attribute TLV carries both the Node IPv4 Local
      Address sub-TLV and the Node IPv6 Local Address sub-TLV, then
      the X-AF component must be considered for the consolidated
      calculation of MPLS TE LSPs. Both instances may carry the
      required information, it is left to local configuration to
      determine which database is used.</t>
      
      <t>On Area Border Routers (ABR), each advertised X-AF IP address
      MUST be advertised into at most one area. If OSPFv2 and OSPFv3
      area borders match (i.e. for each interface area number for
      OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 instances is numerically equal), then the X-AF
      addresses MUST be advertised into the same area in both
      instances. This allows other ABRs connected to the same set of
      areas to know with which area to associate MPLS TE tunnels.</t>
      
      <t>For example, suppose the OSPFv2 instance on a router is used
      for MPLS TE calculation and the OSPFv3 instance will use those
      LSPs for X-AF routing. Further suppose that OSPFv2 advertises
      IPv4 address 1.1.1.1 in Router Address TLV (plus other Traffic
      Engineering TLVs as required by <xref target="RFC3630"/>), and
      additional local IPv4 addresses 1.1.1.2 and 1.1.1.3 in the Node
      IPv4 Local Address sub-TLV as described in <xref
      target="RFC5786"/>. For X-AF routing, the OSPFv3 instance will
      advertise the Node IPv4 Local Address sub-TLV listing the local
      IPv4 addresses 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2 and 1.1.1.3.</t>
      
      <t>During the X-AF routing calculation, X-AF IP addresses are
      used to map locally created LSPs to tail-end routers in the
      LSDB. The mapping algorithm can be described as:
      
	<list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
	  <t>Walk the list of all MPLS TE tunnels for which the
	  computing router is a head-end. For each MPLS TE tunnel
	  T:</t>
	</list>
	<list style="numbers">

	<t>If T's destination IP address is from the same address
	family as the computing OSPF instance, then the tunnel must
	have been signaled based on MPLS TE information propagated in
	the same OSPF instance. Process the tunnel as per <xref
	target="RFC3630"/> or <xref target="RFC5329"/>.</t>
      
	<t>Otherwise it is a X-AF MPLS TE tunnel. Note tunnel's
	destination IP address.</t>
      
	<t>Walk the X-AF IP addresses in the LSDBs of all connected
	areas. If a matching IP address is found, advertised by router
	R in area A, then mark the tunnel T as belonging to area A and
	terminating on tail-end router R. Assign an intra-area SPF
	cost to reach router R within area A as the IGP cost of tunnel
	T.</t>

	</list>
      </t>

      <t>After completing this calculation, each TE tunnel is
      associated with an area and tail-end router in terms of the
      routing LSDB of the computing OSPF instance and has a
      metric.</t>

      <t>Note that for clarity of description the mapping algorithm is
      specified as a single calculation. Actual implementations for
      the efficiency may choose to support equivalent mapping
      functionality without implementing the algorithm exactly as it
      is described.</t>
