Abstract 
    
   With advent of server virtualization technologies, a host is able to 
   support multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) in a single physical 
   machine. Data Centers can leverage these capabilities to instantiate 
   on the order of 10s to 100s of VMs in a single server with current 
   technology.  It is conceivable that this number can be much higher 
   in the future. Each VM operates as an independent IP host with a set 
   of Virtual Network Interface Cards (vNICs), each having its own MAC 
   address and mapping to a physical Ethernet interface. These physical 
   servers are typically installed in a rack with their Ethernet 
   interfaces connected to a top-of-the-rack (ToR) switch. The ToR 
   switches are interconnected through End-of-the-Row (EoR) or 
   aggregation switches which are in turn connected to core switches.  
    
   As discussed in [ARP-Problem] the host VMs use ARP broadcasts to 
   find other host VMs and use periodic (broadcast) Gratuitous ARPs to 
   refresh their IP to MAC address binding in other VM hosts. Such 
   broadcasts in a large data center with potentially thousands of VM 
   hosts in a Layer 2 based topology can overwhelm the network. 
    
   This memo proposes mechanisms to reduce the number of broadcasts 
   that are sent throughout the network. This is done by having the 
   ToRs intelligently process ARP and frames, rather than simply 
   broadcasting them throughout the broadcast domain.  
    
   While this document addresses ARP, the Neighbor Discovery mechanisms 
   used by the IPv6 hosts that make use of multicast rather than 
   broadcast also pose similar issues in the Data Center. The solutions 
   defined herein should be equally applicable to hosts running IPv6.  
   The details will be specified in a subsequent revision.

1.0 Overview 
    
   The traditional topology in a data center consists of racks of 
   servers connected to top-of-rack (ToR) switches, which connect to 
   aggregation switches, which in turn connect to core switches.  The 
   network architecture typically combines Layer 2 and Layer 3.  In 
   some architectures, Layer 2 is terminated at the ToR, with Layer 3 
   being run in the aggregation and core devices.  In other 
   architectures, Layer 2 may be extended all the way to the 
   aggregation switch.  The primary concerns that have influenced 
   network architectures in the data center have been keeping broadcast 
   domains manageable and spanning tree domains contained. 
    
   Moving forward, these traditional network architectures are being 
   challenged due to emerging technologies such as server 
   virtualization.   
    
     
   Shah, et al.           Expires April 2012                         3

   The effect of server virtualization in the data center brings some 
   challenges.  Because of virtualization, the number of hosts that the 
   network sees increases dramatically - 10 to 100 times the number of 
   physical servers.  These virtual hosts are referred to as Virtual 
   machines (VMs).  VMs offer server mobility wherein a VM can be 
   relocated to run on a different physical server.  In order for the 
   mobility to be non-disruptive to other hosts that have communication 
   in progress with the VM being moved, the VM must retain its MAC 
   address and IP address.  Because of the requirement to retain the 
   MAC and IP address, it is desirable to develop network architectures 
   that would offer the least restrictions in terms of server mobility.   
    
   As an example, in a network architecture where TOR switches 
   terminate the L2 domain, the range of mobility would be restricted 
   to a single ToR switch.  It would be more preferable to allow the 
   flexibility of moving the VM anywhere within the data center, or 
   perhaps even a different data center. 
    
   Technologies such as TRILL [TRILL] overcome some of the issues of 
   spanning trees because which traditional Layer 2 topologies have 
   been constrained.  However, because of virtualization there are 2 
   specific problems that are introduced with respect to broadcast 
   traffic. 
     1. A larger number of hosts.  A single physical server now hosts 
        multiple virtual machines taking the scale factor to a 
        different level.  If each VM has the same number of broadcasts 
        as a physical server, the amount of broadcast traffic has 
        increased 10 to greater than 100 times. 
     2. If the Layer 2 domains are extended to go across data centers, 
        then broadcast traffic will now go across the backbone.  If 
        Layer 2 was terminated at the ToR switch, the increase in 
        broadcast traffic would be been restricted to a single ToR 
        switch, but as discussed earlier, this restriction is not 
        desirable. 
    
    
   The broadcast as such in Layer 2 networks has far reaching impacts; 
   i.e. wastage in network bandwidth as well as CPU resources used by 
   all the VMs while processing superfluous ARP broadcasts (IPv6 gets 
   rid of the latter by running ND as a multicast service rather than a 
   broadcast service). 
    
   The solution presented here attempts to minimize negative effects of 
   ARP broadcasts. The solution requires the first hop Ethernet 
   switches, typically ToR, to maintain an ARP table learned from the 
   ARP PDUs received by the switch and selectively propagates the ARP 
   to, or proxy-responds on behalf of, the remote peer. These types of 
   ARP processing principles are well known and used/described in L2VPN 
   Working Group documents such as [ARP-Mediation] and [IPLS]. The ARP 
   proxy response differs from that described in [RFC1027] as the ARP 
   response contains MAC address of the destination and not that of the 
   switch as is suggested in [RFC 1027].

   The following sections describe the details of ARP snooping, 
   learning and maintaining ARP tables, using the learned information 
   to limit broadcast propagation and proxy (the response) on behalf of 
   the remote peers. 
    
    
     
    
1.1 Terminology 
    
    
        ToR switch     Top-of-Rack switch. An Ethernet switch installed 
                       at the top of a rack of servers which provides 
                       network connectivity to those servers.   
    
        Downlink       The Ethernet link between the ToR switch and a 
                        directly connected host/server in the rack. 
          
 
        Uplink         The network-facing Ethernet connection in the 
                        ToR switch. Typically, the uplinks from ToRs 
                        connect to end-of-row or aggregation switches.  
         
        EoR switch     End-of-Row switch.  An Ethernet switch which 
                        aggregates traffic from multiple racks.  Also 
                        commonly referred to as an aggregation switch. 
                        Uplinks from the ToR connects to EoR switches 
                        and uplinks from EoR switches in turn connect 
                        to core switches. 
         
        Host/Server    A host or server running the IP protocol.  This 
                        could be a physical entity or a logical entity 
                        (such as a Virtual Machine) in a physical host. 
                        The term server refers to its role in data 
                        center.  Both terms are used interchangeably 
                        and refer to an IP end station. 
         
        Local hosts    Used in the context of a ToR switch to denote 
                        the VM hosts connected to a ToR switch on the 
                        downlink, i.e. directly connected hosts.  
         
        Remote hosts    Used in the context of a ToR switch to denote 
                        the hosts that are accessible via the uplink of 
                        the ToR switch.  
         
        VM             Virtual Machine. This is a logical instance of 
                        a host that operates independently in a 
                        physical host and has its own IP and MAC 
                        addresses. The VM architecture allows efficient 
                        use of physical host resources (such as 
                        multiple CPU cores).

2.0 Configuration 
    
   It is assumed that ARP reduction methodologies that are defined in 
   this document will be limited to ToR switches.   The maximum benefit 
   of restraining ARP broadcasts in the network is achieved by the 
   first hop switches (the ones directly connected to the hosts) 
   without placing additional burden on second or third tier switches.  
    
   First, the ToR switches would need to be configured in order to 
   enable the ARP reduction feature. Every Ethernet interface needs to 
   be identified as either a downlink or uplink within the context of 
   this feature. The ARP reduction feature treats ARP frames received 
   from downlink or uplink differently as described in the following 
   sections. 
     
   In additional the operator may optionally configure various ARP 
   reduction related parameters such as: 
     . ARP aging timer, 
     . size of the ARP table, 
     . static entries of IP to MAC address, etc. 
    
    
3.0 Building the ARP tables 
 
   When ARP reduction is enabled, the ToR switch will monitor all ARP 
   traffic transiting the switch (regardless of uplink port or downlink 
   port) and will process any ARP PDUs in the following manner:  
     . ARP Request PDUs must be redirected to control plane CPU. 
     . Gratuitous ARP PDUs (ARP Reply PDU with a broadcast MAC DA) 
        must be redirected to control plane CPU. 
     . Other ARP Reply PDUs (ARP Reply PDU with a unicast MAC DA) 
        should be bi-casted; one copy sent to control plane CPU and 
        other copy forwarded out normally. 
    
    
    
3.1 ARP Requests 
    
   The ToR examines the source IP and the source hardware address (MAC 
   address) in the ARP Request . The source IP and MAC address 
   association is learned, or is updated/refreshed if already learned. 
   The destination IP address is searched in the ARP table. If an entry 
   exists, the associated MAC address from the table is used to prepare 
   a unicast ARP Reply PDU. The same MAC address is used as the source 
   MAC address in the MAC header, as well as for the target hardware 
   address,in the unicast ARP Reply PDU. 
    
   If the destination IP address in the request is not present in the 
   ARP table, then the original ARP request PDU is broadcast to all the 
   switch ports that are member of the same VLAN except the source port 
   that the Request was received from. However, if the requested 
     
   Shah, et al.           Expires April 2012                         6 
   Internet Draft   draft-shah-arp-reduction-02.txt 
                                    
    
   (destination) IP address is present in the ARP table, a unicast ARP 
   Reply PDU is prepared as described above and sent to the switch port 
   from which the ARP Request was received and original ARP request PDU 
   is dropped. 
    
   The intent is to prevent propagation of ARP Request PDU broadcasts 
   as much as possible using the information present in the ARP table. 
   The following observations can be made from such behavior. 
      . Most of the ARP requests from the local hosts of a ToR switch 
         for the local hosts of the ToR switch can be prevented. 
      . Most of the ARP requests from the remote hosts of a ToR switch 
         for the local hosts of the ToR switch can be prevented from 
         getting forwarded on downlinks or other uplinks of the ToR 
         switch. 
      . Many of the ARP requests from the local hosts of a ToR switch 
         for the remote hosts of the ToR switch can be prevented from 
         being forwarded on uplinks if the remote host IP to MAC 
         association is known to the ToR switch. 
    
3.2 ARP Reply 
    
   The unicast ARP Reply is examined to learn/update the ARP table for 
   source and destination IP/MAC address association, but is also 
   forwarded out as a normal frame. 
    
3.3 Gratuitous ARP 
    
   Gratuitous ARP is a broadcast ARP Reply PDU with destination IP 
   address set to the IP address of the sender and target hardware 
   address set to the MAC address of the sender. It is typically used 
   by the IP hosts (including VMs) to keep its association fresh in 
   peer's ARP cache.  
    
   The ToR switch should process Gratuitous ARP in the following 
   manner. 
      . Learn/update/refresh the ARP table entry. 
      . If the IP address is new, or exists but with a different 
         hardware address, then the Gratuitous ARP PDU is forwarded 
         out; otherwise the PDU is discarded. 
    
   The goal for handling of the Gratuitous ARP PDU received from the 
   downlinks (i.e. local hosts) is to avoid propagating it into the 
   'network' (i.e. to uplinks), unless there is a new association.  
    
   By suppressing the propagation of Gratuitous ARP PDUs, the peer IP 
   hosts will end up aging out the corresponding ARP table entries.  
   This will result in generation of the broadcast ARP Requests by 
   those IP hosts if they need to continue to communicate with the IP 
   host whose Gratuitous ARPs were obstructed. The handling of the ARP 
   Request, as described above, by the first hop ToR switch will be 
   able to respond to this request based on the ARP cache maintained in 
   the ToR switch. In essence, presence of large ARP tables with longer 
   age out times compensates for the smaller ARP table present in the 
     
   Shah, et al.           Expires April 2012                         7 
   Internet Draft   draft-shah-arp-reduction-02.txt 
                                    
    
   IP hosts and eliminates the need for periodic use of Gratuitous ARPs 
   in order to refresh the ARP table in the IP hosts. 
      
 
3.4 Host movement 
    
   As mentioned earlier, server virtualization technology allows 
   movement of VMs to different physical servers. The flexibility to 
   move VMs is one of the key benefits of server virtualization. The 
   VM movement could be manual (operator initiated) or may be done 
   automatically in reaction to demands placed by the application 
   users. The important point is that in either case, VM movement is 
   not transparent and is made known to the network.  
    
   There is ongoing work in IEEE 802.1 standards organization (IEEE 
   802.1Qbg) to coordinate/communicate the presence and capabilities of 
   the VMs to the directly connected network switch. 
    
   VMs typically retain their MAC and IP address, and as such, there 
   would be little impact to the ARP table maintained by the ARP 
   reduction mechanism described herein.  However, the ARP reduction 
   mechanism would benefit from knowing if a VM is completely 
   decommissioned so that the ToR can removed the ARP entry it has for 
   that VM in a timely fashion, rather than waiting for it to timeout. 
 
3.5 Applicability to environments with overlay transport 
    
   Recently, there have been multiple proposals for using overlay 
   transport technologies such as VXLAN [VXLAN] and NVGRE [NVGRE].  
   These proposals allow the network operator to build the network 
   using L2 or L3 technologies while building an L2-overlay on top of 
   that.  As such, while they address the issue of network design, they 
   do not eliminate the need for a mechanism to reduce the amount of 
   broadcast traffic that may have to traverse the core, if there are 
   VMs of the same tenant on servers attached to different ToR 
   switches. 
    
   One of the ways for the overlay transport proposals to address this 
   issue would be to implement the mechanism discussed in this document 
   at the point where the overlay encapsulation and decapsulation is 
   performed (i.e. in the virtual switch). 
    
    
3.6 Scaling Considerations 
    
   Depending on the number of hosts in the networks, the ARP table can 
   be quite large. Although it is possible to implement some of the 
   mechanisms for ARP reduction as described in this document in 
   hardware in the forwarding plane, the number of ARP entries may 
   favor maintaining the ARP table in the control plane memory.

3.7 Miscellaneous Issues 
    
   Because of the distributed nature of the mechanisms described 
   herein, there are a few additional issues that warrant consideration 
   from the network operator. 
    
   Earlier in the document, we had mentioned the configuration of a 
   timer for ARP entries.  A longer timer for holding on to ARP entries 
   helps with reduction of broadcasts.  However, the risk of having a 
   "too large timer" can cause problems in certain situations. 
   Consider the following scenario.  Host A is attached to ToR switch 
   #1, and host B is attached to ToR switch #2.  If host B issues an 
   ARP request for host A, if the entry is available at switch #2, then 
   switch #2 would send the ARP Reply on behalf of host A.  It is 
   possible that host A is no longer available, but there is no way for 
   switch #2 to know this, and it would continue to respond on behalf 
   of host A, until its entry for host A has timed out.  In this case, 
   it is easy to see that a smaller timer would be beneficial.  
   Additionally, since host B has an ARP age timer, it means that host 
   B would find out about host A's unavailability only after its entry 
   has aged, which would be after it has aged out of switch #2. 
    
   Another issue that can be somewhat problematic could be the 
   inconsistency of tables in switches.  Once again, consider a 
   scenario similar to the one described above with 2 hosts each 
   connected to its respect ToR switch.  Let the ARP entries at both A 
   and B be learned by both switches.  Now assume that the IP address 
   on host A changes.  This change is signaled to switch #1 which in 
   turn broadcasts the message on its uplink.  Now, if this message is 
   discarded due to network congestion or signal integrity issues, then 
   switch #2 will not learn about the change and will continue to 
   respond to host B's ARP Requests for host A's old IP address with 
   stale information.  This lasts until the ARP entry for A times out 
   at Switch #2. 
    
    
 
    
4.0 Conclusion 
    
   Based on the procedures described in this document, it is possible 
   for ToR switches in the data center to contain ARP broadcasts 
   significantly. The solution is based on well known, non-intrusive 
   procedures and strives to curtail broadcasts that are increasingly 
   becoming a cause for concern in the data centers. In essence, ToR 
   switches facilitate the offloading of the extended ARP table 
   management from the IP hosts to itself. The ARP table timeout can be 
   tuned higher by the operator based on the available switch resources 
   and network traffic behavior. The larger capacity of the ARP table 
   directly translates to more effective subduing of the ARP 
   broadcasts.
