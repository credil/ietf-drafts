    <abstract>
      <t>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been one of the major buzz
      words of the networking industry for the past couple of years. And yet,
      no clear definition of what SDN actually covers has been broadly
      admitted so far. This document aims at contributing to the clarification
      of the SDN landscape by discussing a service provider's perspective on
      requirements, issues and other considerations about SDN.</t>

      <t>It is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN truly means, but rather
      to suggest a functional taxonomy of the techniques that can be used
      under a SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the various pending issues the
      combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises. As such, a
      definition of SDN is only mentioned for the sake of clarification.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Internet has become the federative network that supports a wide
      range of service offerings. The delivery of network services such as IP
      VPNs assumes the combined activation of various capabilities that
      include (but are not necessarily limited to) forwarding and routing
      capabilities (e.g., customer-specific addressing scheme management,
      dynamic path computation to reach a set of destination prefixes, dynamic
      establishment of tunnels, etc.), quality of service capabilities (e.g.,
      traffic classification and marking, traffic conditioning and
      scheduling), security capabilities (e.g., filters to protect customer
      premises from network-originated attacks, to avoid malformed route
      announcements, etc.) and management capabilities (e.g., fault detection
      and processing).</t>

      <t>As these services not only grow in variety but also in complexity,
      their design, delivery and operation have become a complex alchemy that
      often requires various levels of expertise. This situation is further
      aggravated by the wide variety of (network) protocols and tools, as well
      as recent Any Time Any-Where Any Device (ATAWAD)-driven convergence
      trends that are meant to make sure an end-user can access the whole
      range of services he/she has subscribed to, whatever the access and
      device technologies, wherever the end-user is connected to the network,
      and whether this end-user is in motion or not.</t>

      <t>Yet, most of these services have been deployed for the past decade,
      primarily based upon often static service production procedures that are
      more and more exposed to the risk of erroneous configuration commands.
      In addition, most of these services do not assume any specific
      negotiation between the customer and the service provider or between
      service providers besides the typical financial terms.</t>

      <t>At best, five-year master plans are referred to as the network
      planning policy that will be enforced by the service provider, given the
      foreseen business development perspectives, manually-computed traffic
      forecasts and the market coverage (fixed/mobile, residential/corporate).
      This so-called network planning policy may very well affect the way
      resources are allocated in a network, but clearly fails to be adequately
      responsive to highly dynamic customer requirements in an
      &ldquo;always-on&rdquo; fashion. The need for improved service delivery
      procedures (including the time it takes to deliver the service once
      possible negotiation phase is completed) is even more critical for
      corporate customers.</t>

      <t>In addition, various tools are used for different, sometimes
      service-centric, management purposes but their usage is not necessarily
      coordinated for the sake of event aggregation, correlation and
      processing. At the cost of extra complexity and possible customer's
      Quality of Experience degradation.</t>

      <t>Multi-service, multi-protocol, multi-technology convergent and
      dynamically-adaptive networking environments of the near future have
      therefore become one of the major challenges faced by service
      providers.</t>

      <t>This document aims at clarifying the SDN landscape.</t>

    <section anchor="sdn" title="Introducing Software-Defined Networking">
      <t></t>

      <section title="A Tautology?">
        <t>The separation of the forwarding and control planes (beyond
        implementation considerations) have almost become a gimmick to promote
        flexibility as a key feature of the SDN approach. Technically, most of
        current router implementations have been assuming this separation for
        decades. Routing processes (such as IGP and BGP route computation)
        have often been software-based, while forwarding capabilities are
        hardware-encoded.</t>

        <t>As such, the current state-of-the-art tends to confirm the said
        separation, which rather falls under a tautology.</t>

        <t>But a somewhat centralized, "controller-embedded", control plane
        for the sake of optimized route computation before FIB population is
        certainly another story.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="On Flexibility">
        <t>This "flexibility argument" that has been put forward by SDN
        promoters is undoubtedly one of the key objectives that must be
        achieved by service providers. This is because the ability to
        dynamically adapt to a wide range of customer's requests for the sake
        of flexible network service delivery is an important competitive
        advantage. But flexibility is much, much more than separating the
        control and forwarding planes to facilitate forwarding decision-making
        processes.</t>

        <t>For example, the ability to accommodate short duration extra
        bandwidth requirements so that end users can stream a video file to
        their 4G terminal device is an example of that flexibility that
        several mobile operators are currently investigating.</t>

        <t>From this perspective, the ability to predict the network behavior
        as a function of the network services to be delivered is of paramount
        importance for service providers, so that they can assess the impact
        of introducing new services or activating additional network features
        or enforcing a given set of (new) policies from both a financial and
        technical standpoints. This argues in favor of investigating advanced
        network emulation engines, which can be fed with information that can
        be derived from <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution"></xref>,
        for example.</t>

        <t>Given the rather broad scope that the flexibility wording suggests:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>The exact characterization of what flexibility actually means
            is still required.</t>

            <t>The exposure of programmable interfaces is not a goal per se,
            rather a means to facilitate configuration procedures for the sake
            of improved flexibility.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="def" title="A Tentative Definition">
        <t>We define Software-Defined Networking as the set of techniques used
        to facilitate the design, the delivery and the operation of network
        services in a deterministic, dynamic, and scalable manner.</t>

        <t>Such a definition assumes the introduction of a high level of
        automation in the overall service delivery and operation
        procedures.</t>

        <t>Because networking is software-driven by nature, the above
        definition does not emphasize the claimed "Software-Defined"
        properties of SDN-labeled solutions.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Functional Meta-Domains">
        <t>SDN techniques can be classified into the following functional
        meta-domains:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Techniques for the dynamic discovery of network topology,
            devices and capabilities, along with relevant information models
            that are meant to precisely document such topology, devices and
            capabilities.</t>

            <t>Techniques for exposing network services (and their
            characteristics; e.g., <xref
            target="I-D.boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-profile"></xref>)
            and for dynamically negotiating the set of service parameters that
            will be used to measure the level of quality associated to the
            delivery of a given service or a combination thereof.</t>

            <t>Techniques used by service requirements-derived dynamic
            resource allocation and policy enforcement schemes, so that
            networks can be programmed accordingly. Decisions made to
            dynamically allocate resources and enforce policies are typically
            the result of the correlation of various inputs, such as the
            status of available resources in the network at any given time,
            the number of customer service subscription requests that need to
            be processed over a given period of time, the traffic forecasts
            and the possible need to trigger additional resource provisioning
            cycles according to a typical multi-year master plan, etc.</t>

            <t>Dynamic feedback mechanisms that are meant to assess how
            efficiently a given policy (or a set thereof) is enforced from a
            service fulfillment and assurance perspective.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Scope" title="A Few Considerations">
      <t>The networking ecosystem has become awfully complex and highly
      demanding in terms of robustness, performance, scalability, flexibility,
      agility, etc. This means in particular that service providers and
      network operators must deal with such complexity and operate networking
      infrastructures that can evolve easily, remain scalable, guarantee
      robustness and availability, and are resilient against denial-of-service
      attacks.</t>

      <t>The introduction of new SDN-based networking features should
      obviously take into account this context, especially from a cost impact
      assessment perspective.</t>

      <section title="Remember The Past">
        <t>SDN techniques are not the next big thing per se, but rather a kind
        of rebranding of proposals that have been investigated for several
        years, like Active or Programmable Networks. As a matter of fact, some
        of the claimed "new" SDN features have been already implemented (e.g.,
        NMS (Network Management System), PCE (Path Computation Element, <xref
        target="RFC4655"></xref>)), and supported by vendors for quite some
        time (references can be added if needed).</t>

        <t>Some of these features have also been standardized (e.g., DNS-based
        routing <xref target="RFC1383"></xref> that can be seen as an
        illustration of separated control and forwarding planes or ForCES
        (<xref target="RFC5810"></xref><xref target="RFC5812"></xref>)).</t>

        <t>Also, the Policy-Based Management framework<xref
        target="RFC2753"></xref> introduced in the early 2000's was designed
        to orchestrate available resources, by means of a typical Policy
        Decision Point (PDP) which masters advanced offline traffic
        engineering capabilities. As such, this framework has the ability to
        interact with in-band software modules embedded in controlled devices
        (or not).</t>

        <t>The Policy Decision Point (PDP) is where policy decisions are made.
        PDPs use a directory service for policy repository purposes. The
        policy repository stores the policy information that can be retrieved
        and updated by the PDP. The PDP delivers policy rules to the Policy
        Enforcement Point (PEP) in the form of policy-provisioning information
        that includes configuration information.</t>

        <t>The Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is where policy decisions are
        applied. PEPs are embedded in (network) devices, which are dynamically
        configured based upon the policy-formatted information that has been
        processed by the PEP. PEPs request configuration from the PDP, store
        the configuration information in the Policy Information Base (PIB),
        and delegate any policy decision to the PDP.</t>

        <t>SDN techniques as a whole are an instantiation of the policy-based
        network management framework. Within this context, SDN techniques can
        be used to activate capabilities on demand, to dynamically invoke
        network and storage resources and to operate dynamically-adaptive
        networks according to events (e.g., alteration of the network
        topology) and triggers (e.g., dynamic notification of a link failure),
        etc.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Be Pragmatic">
        <t>SDN approaches should be holistic, i.e., global, network-wise. It
        is not a matter of configuring devices one by one to enforce a
        specific forwarding policy. SDN techniques are about configuring and
        operating a whole range of devices at the scale of the network for the
        sake of automated service delivery (<xref
        target="I-D.boucadair-network-automation-requirements"></xref>), from
        service negotiation and creation (e.g., <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-idr-sla-exchange"></xref>) to assurance and
        fulfillment.</t>

        <t>Because the complexity of activating SDN capabilities is largely
        hidden to the end-user and software-handled, a clear understanding of
        the overall ecosystem is needed to figure out how to manage this
        complexity and to what extent this hidden complexity does not have
        side effects on network operation.</t>

        <t>As an example, SDN designs that assume a central decision-making
        entity must avoid single points of failure. They must not affect
        packet forwarding performances either (e.g., transit delays must not
        be impacted).</t>

        <t>SDN techniques are not necessary to develop new network services
        per se. The basic service remains (IP) connectivity that solicits
        resources located in the network. SDN techniques can thus be seen as
        another means to interact with network service modules and invoke both
        connectivity and storage resources accordingly in order to meet
        service-specific requirements.</t>

        <t>By definition, SDN technique activation and operation remain
        limited to what is supported by embedded software and hardware. One
        cannot expect SDN techniques to support unlimited customizable
        features.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Measure Experience Against Expectations">
        <t>Because several software modules may be controlled by external
        entities, means to ensure that what has been delivered complies with
        what has been negotiated belong to the set of SDN techniques.</t>

        <t>These typical policy-based techniques should interact with both
        Service Structuring engines (that are meant to expose the service
        characteristics and to possibly negotiate those characteristics) and
        the network to continuously assess whether the experienced network
        behavior is compliant with the objectives set by the Service
        Structuring engine, and which may have been dynamically negotiated
        with the customer (e.g., as captured in a CPP <xref
        target="I-D.boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-profile"></xref>,
        <xref
        target="I-D.boucadair-connectivity-provisioning-protocol"></xref>).
        This requirement applies to several regions of a network, including:
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>At the interface between two adjacent IP network providers.</t>

            <t>At the access interface between a service provider and an IP
            network provider.</t>

            <t>At the interface between a customer and the IP network
            provider.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Ideally, a fully automated service delivery procedure from
        negotiation and ordering, through order processing, to delivery,
        assurance and fulfillment, should be supported. This approach assumes
        widely adopted standard data and information models, let alone
        interfaces.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Design Carefully">
        <t>Exposing open and programmable interfaces has a cost, from both a
        scalability and performance standpoints.</t>

        <t>Maintaining hard-coded performance optimization techniques is
        encouraged. So is the use of interfaces that allow the direct control
        of some engines (e.g., routing, forwarding) without requiring any
        in-between adaptation layer (generic objects to vendor-specific CLI
        commands for instance).</t>

        <t>SDN techniques will have to accommodate vendor-specific components
        anyway. Indeed, these vendor-specific features will not cease to exist
        mainly because of the harsh competition.</t>

        <t>The introduction of new functions or devices that may jeopardize
        network flexibility should be avoided, or at least carefully
        considered in light of possible performance and scalability impacts.
        SDN-enabled devices will have to coexist with legacy systems.</t>

        <t>One single SDN, network-wise deployment is therefore very unlikely.
        Instead, multiple instantiations of SDN techniques will be
        progressively deployed and adapted to various network and service
        segments.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="There Is Life Beyond OpenFlow">
        <t>Empowering networking with in-band controllable modules does not
        necessarily mean the use of the OpenFlow protocol, which is just
        another protocol that helps devices populate their forwarding tables
        according to a set of instructions.</t>

        <t>OpenFlow is clearly not the "next big thing": there are many, many
        other candidate protocols that can be used for the same or even
        broader purposes (e.g., resource reservation purposes). The forwarding
        of the configuration information can indeed rely upon a variety of
        protocols that include (but is not necessarily limited to) PCEP <xref
        target="RFC5440"></xref>, NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"></xref>,
        COPS-PR <xref target="RFC3084"></xref>, Routing Policy Specification
        Language (RPSL, <xref target="RFC2622"></xref>), etc.</t>

        <t>There is therefore no 1:1 relationship between OpenFlow and SDN.
        Rather, OpenFlow is one of the candidate protocols to convey specific
        configuration information towards devices. As such, OpenFlow is one
        possible component of the global SDN toolkit.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Non Goals">
        <t>There are inevitable trade-offs to be found between operating the
        current networking ecosystem and introducing some SDN techniques,
        possibly at the cost of introducing new technologies. Operators do not
        have to choose between the two as both environments will have to
        coexist.</t>

        <t>In particular, the following considerations cannot justify the
        deployment of SDN techniques: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Fully flexible software implementations, because the claimed
            flexibility will be limited by respective software and hardware
            limitations, anyway.</t>

            <t>Fully modular implementations are difficult to achieve (because
            of the implicit complexity) and may introduce extra effort for
            testing, validation and troubleshooting.</t>

            <t>Fully centralized control systems that are likely to raise some
            scalability issues. Distributed protocols and their ability to
            react to some events (e.g., link failure) in a timely manner
            remains a cornerstone of scalable networks. This means that SDN
            designs can rely upon a logical representation of centralized
            features (an abstraction layer that would support inter-PDP
            communications, for example).</t>

    <section anchor="issues" title="Discussion">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Implications Of Full Automation">
        <t>The path towards full automation is paved with numerous challenges
        and requirements, including:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Make sure automation is well implemented so as to facilitate
            testing (including validation checks) and troubleshooting. <list
                style="symbols">
                <t>This suggests the need for simulation tools that accurately
                assess the impact of introducing a high level of automation in
                the overall service delivery procedure, so as to avoid a
                typical "mad robot" syndrome whose consequences can be
                serious, from a control and QoS standpoints among others.</t>

                <t>This also suggests careful management of human expertise,
                so that network operators can use robust, flexible means to
                automate repetitive or error-prone tasks, and then build on
                automation or stringing together multiple actions to create
                increasingly complex tasks that require less human interaction
                (guidance, input) to complete.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Simplify and foster service delivery, assurance and
            fulfillment, as well as network failure detection, diagnosis and
            root cause analysis, for the sake of cost optimization: <list

                <t>Such cost optimization relates to improved service delivery
                times as well as optimized human expertise (see above) and
                global, technology-agnostic, service structuring and delivery
                procedures. In particular, the ability to inject new functions
                in existing devices should not assume a replacement of the
                said devices, but rather allow smart investment
                capitalization.</t>

                <t>This can be achieved thanks to automation, possibly based
                upon a logically centralized view of the network
                infrastructure (or a portion thereof), yielding the need for
                highly automated topology, device and capabilities discovery
                means as well as operational procedures.</t>

                <t>The main intelligence resides in the PDP, which suggests
                that an important part of the SDN-related development effort
                should focus on a detailed specification of the PDP function,
                including algorithms and behavioral state machineries, based

      <section anchor="pdp" title="The Intelligence Resides In The PDP">
        <t>The proposed SDN definition in <xref target="def"></xref> assumes
        an intelligence that may reside in the control or the management
        planes (or both). This intelligence is typically represented by a
        Policy Decision Point (PDP), which is one of the key functional
        components of the Policy-Based Management framework <xref
        target="RFC2753"></xref>.</t>

        <t>SDN networking therefore relies upon PDP functions that are capable
        of processing various input data (traffic forecasts, outcomes of
        negotiation between customers and service providers, resource status
        (as depicted in appropriate information models instantiated in the
        PIB, etc.) to make appropriate decisions.</t>

        <t>The design and the operation of such PDP-based intelligence in a
        scalable manner remains of the major areas that needs to be
        investigated.</t>

        <t>To avoid centralized design schemes, inter-PDP communication is
        likely to be required, and corresponding issues and solutions should
        be considered. Several PDP instances may thus be activated in a given
        domain. Because each of these PDP instances may be responsible for
        making decisions about the enforcement of a specific policy (e.g., one
        PDP for QoS policy enforcement purposes, another one for security
        policy enforcement purposes, etc.), an inter-PDP communication scheme
        is required for the sake of global PDP coordination and
        correlation.</t>

        <t>Inter-domain PDP exchanges may also be needed for specific usages.
        Examples of such exchanges are: (1) During the network attachment
        phase of a node to a visited network, the PDP operated by the visited
        network can contact the home PDP to retrieve the policies to be
        enforced for that node. (2) Various PDPs can collaborate together in
        order to compute inter-domain paths which satisfy a set of traffic
        performance guarantees.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Simplicity And Adaptability Vs. Complexity">
        <t>The meta functional domains introduced in Section 2.4 assume the
        introduction of a high level of automation, from service negotiation
        to delivery and operation. Automation is the key to simplicity, but
        must not be seen as a magic button that would be hit by a network
        administrator whenever a customer request has to be processed or
        additional resources need to be allocated.</t>

        <t>The need for simplicity and adaptability thanks to automated
        procedures generally assumes some complexity that lies beneath
        automation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Performance And Scalability">
        <t>The combination of flexibility with software inevitably raises
        performance and scalability issues as a function of the number and the
        nature of the services to be delivered and their associated
        dynamics.</t>

        <t>For example: while the deployment of a network solely composed of
        OpenFlow switches within a data center environment is unlikely to
        raise FIB scalability issues given the current state-of-the-art, data
        center networking that relies upon complex, possibly IP-based,
        QoS-inferred, interconnect design schemes meant to dynamically manage
        the mobility of Virtual Machines between sites is certainly of another
        scale.</t>

        <t>The claimed flexibility of SDN networking in the latter context
        will have to be carefully investigated by operators.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Risk Assessement">
        <t>Various risks are to be assessed such as:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Evaluating the risk of depending on a controller technology
            rather than a device technology.</t>

            <t>Evaluating the risk of operating frozen architectures because
            of potential interoperability issues between a controller and a
            controlled device.</t>

            <t>Assessing whether SDN-labeled solutions are likely to obsolete
            existing technologies because of hardware limitations.</t>

            <t>Etc.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="On Security">
        <t>Security has to be a first-class part of any SDN design, thus
        giving both network and applications people the control to ensure that
        the other has access to the info and controls that they need (but no
        more), and to ensure that they are properly safeguarded against taking
        actions that will adversely affect the network or application as a
        whole <xref target="I-D.hartman-sdnsec-requirements"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Likewise, PEP-PDP interactions suggest the need to make sure that
        (1) A PDP is entitled to solicit PEPs so that they can apply the
        decisions made by the said PDP, (2) A PEP is entitled to solicit a PDP
        for whatever reason (request for additional configuration information,
        notification about the results of a set of configuration tasks, etc.),
        and (3) communication between PDPs within a domain or between domains
        is properly secured (e.g., make sure a pair of PDPs are entitled to
        communicate with each other, make sure the confidentiality of the
        information exchanged between two PDPs can be preserved, etc.).</t>
