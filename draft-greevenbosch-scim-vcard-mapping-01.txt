Abstract

   This document defines a mapping between Simple Cloud Identity
   Management (SCIM) and vCard.  It can be used for conversion between
   the different schemes, or as guidance to select one of them.

Internet-Draft             SCIM/vCard mapping              November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) core schema
   [I-D.scim-core-schema] defines a platform neutral data and extension
   model for representing users of cloud services.  SCIM core also
   defines XML and JSON serialisations of the abstract schema.

   This document defines a mapping between SCIM and vCard [RFC6350].
   The mapping may serve several purposes:

   o  To provide a unified conversion mechanism between SCIM and vCard.

   o  To identify properties that are defined in vCard, but are missing
      in SCIM.

   o  To identify SCIM attributes that may be useful in vCard too.

   o  To serve as guidance to consider whether vCard can be used as a
      basis for SCIM.

   o  To provide discussion material on whether vCard could replace the
      SCIM schema completely.

   The SCIM WG is recommended to consider these issues.

3.  Mapping from SCIM attributes to vCard properties

   Table 1 describes a mapping from SCIM attributes to the vCard
   properties.

   The reverse mapping from vCard to SCIM is defined in Section 4.  The
   reason for having two tables is that some mappings are not
   invertible.

5.  Mapping between SCIM and vCard IDs

   A SCIM specific prefix could be used to indicate the conversion from
   SCIM IDs to vCard UIDs.  A "Service Provider" specific part would
   need to be included in the vCard UID, as the SCIM ID is unique within
   the Service Provider's space only.  The following format is proposed:

                   UID:scim:[serviceProviderID]:123456789

   Conversion from vCard to SCIM may be done similarly, i.e. by adding a
   prefix to the vCard UID.  The SCIM schema document mentions for the
   SCIM ID: "This identifier MUST be unique across the Service
   Provider's entire set of Resources", so as long as the vCard UID
   indeed is globally unique, and the service provider uses the prefix
   for vCard acquired resources only, the rule should hold.

   Notice that the above mechanism allows looping.  For example,
   converting SCIM -> vCard -> SCIM would lead to another SCIM ID in the
   second representation as in the first.  This indeed reflects the
   possible loss of information in the conversion process.  Of course
   this kind of tandem conversion should be avoided as much as possible.

   Because of the format of the vCard UID after conversion from SCIM,
   the SCIM service provider can detect above mentioned tandem coding,
   as well as the original vCard ID.  The actions the service provider
   may take upon such detection may for example include using the
   original SCIM data instead, or using smarter mapping by analysing the
   original and the new import.  This kind of mechanisms is left out of
   scope of this document.

6.  Open issues

   The following is a list of open issues:

   o  Exact mapping from vCard UIDs to SCIM IDs.

   o  Text in [I-D.scim-core-schema] defines only plural "emails",
      "phoneNumbers", "ims", "photos", "addresses", "groups",
      "entitlements" and "roles" elements.  However, the XML examples
      show that these plural element contain the associated singular
      elements.  This is not the case for the JSON representation.

   o  It is unclear on whether the SCIM ID can include alphanumeric
      characters or is restricted to numeric characters only.  The
      examples in [I-D.scim-core-schema] seem to indicate that they
      consist of hexadecimal numbers, with dashes at appropriate places.
      If this is the case, then during the conversion from vCard UIDs to
      SCIM IDs would include conversion of alphanumeric characters to
      hexadecimal values.

7.  IANA Considerations

   A "manager" TYPE for the RELATED vCard property may need
   registration.

8.  Security Considerations

   The mapping between vCard and SCIM may be useful for easily
   transferring data for one system towards another.  However, it also
   has privacy implications.  Therefore, it is important that user
   consensus is acquired where applicable.

   For this document, some decisions were made concerning mapping
   between attributes and properties with similar, but not equal,
   semantics.  This was done in a best effort manner.  However one
   should realise that during the mapping process some accuracy from the
   original data may be lost.

   Tandem conversion between SCIM and vCard SHOULD be avoided as much as
   possible.
