Internet-Draft         Certified Electronic Mail       February 24, 2012


1  Introduction

   Except in some particular situations, no party involved in a
   traditional email communication can prove to have sent or received a
   certain message. The user cannot be sure of obtaining proof of the
   message exchange in terms of authenticity and integrity.

   During the past few years, many certified email systems have been
   theorized, implemented and deployed on the Internet to meet the needs
   of submission and delivery warranty when sending messages. Some of
   these were developed by private companies or consortiums, such as
   PostX, Goodmail, Tumbleweed. Others were designed by European
   governments, after the European Community created the EU Directives
   which invite governments to facilitate the provision of services,
   including reliable and good-quality digital communication [EU99-
   93][EU06-123][EU08-6].

   However, this resulted in each country realizing its own system, in
   some cases even more than one; some built up on standard email
   systems (e.g. Italian PEC [RFC6109], German DeMail) with ad-hoc
   extensions, others developed up on other web technologies (e.g.
   Austrian DDS, Slovenian Moja.posta.si). Each system currently has
   different characteristics and offers different guarantees, and is
   incapable of communicating with others. A very good analysis of these
   solutions has been made by Arne Tauber [TAUBER].

   The increasing need for standardization thus becomes evident. Some
   standardization authorities are trying to close this loophole. For
   example, ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) has
   defined the REM standard (Registered Electronic Mail), upon which UPU
   (Universal Postal Union) bases its PReM standard (Postal Registered
   eMail). The latter seems currently the only way to communicate
   worldwide in a "certified" way using digital messages.

   Some private solutions failed because they didn't become a "de facto
   standard," while governmental solutions are alive thanks to law
   constraints that require companies to have a certified mailbox, but
   many of them struggle to take off. The reasons for this could be
   found in the following:
      - Providers: lacking of a standard or de facto standard, each
      company realizes its own solution and tries to penetrate it on the
      market.
      - Users: most developed solutions have different paradigms of use
      compared to what users are used to.
      - Interoperability: Users are required to have as many accounts as
      many are the systems required by law and used by their partners.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Features and requirements

   Analyzing existing systems and the state of the art, we can summarize
   the required features of the solution.

2.1 Required features

   Integrity:
      The message MUST be delivered without modification.

   Authenticity:
      The message can only be generated by the person who asserts
      sending the message.

   Evidence Generation:
      The system MUST generate the evidence of the following:

      End-User <--> Provider

         -  Non-Repudiation:
            Provides protection against false denial of involvement in
            an association (especially a communication association that
            transfers data) [RFC4949].

            In  particular different kinds of Non-Repudiation can be
            analyzed:
            - Non-Repudiation of Origin (NRO)
               Provides the recipient of data with evidence that proves
               the origin of the data, and thus protects the recipient
               against an attempt by the originator to falsely deny
               sending the data [RFC4949].

            - Non-Repudiation of Receipt (NRR)
               Provides the originator of data with evidence that proves
               the data was received as addressed, and thus protects the
               originator against an attempt by the recipient to falsely
               deny receiving the data [RFC4949].

            - Non-Repudiation of Submission (NRS)
               A protocol provides non-repudiation of submission if and
               only if it gives evidence against the false denial of
               having submitted the message.

Internet-Draft         Certified Electronic Mail       February 24, 2012


            - User Non-Repudiation of Delivery (U-NRD)
               A protocol provides non-repudiation of delivery if and
               only if it gives evidence against the false denial of
               having delivered the message.

            The system MUST support the possibility to obtain all types
            of Non-Repudiation (and their negative equivalent) evidence.
            U-NRD and NRS MUST be always guaranteed to the users in a
            certified communication, while NRO and NRR can be OPTIONAL
            depending on users configurations.

         - Timeout Notification:
            If the sender does not receive a notification about the
            success or failure of delivery of his message, the system
            send to the user a Timeout Notification.

      Provider <--> Provider

         - Provider Non-Repudiation of Delivery (P-NRD)
            A protocol provides provider non-repudiation of delivery if
            and only if it gives evidence against the false denial of
            provider of having received the message and taken it in
            charge.


2.2  Desiderata

   Confidentiality:
      Ensure that a message is read by the receiver only. The system
      could use encryption to accomplish this.

2.3  Involved parties requirements

   Users:
      - Use already known programs and avoid having to learn another
      method of operating.
      - Possibility to communicate with Internet standard email users.
      - Use the same email address (mailbox) for certified and standard
      use.

   Providers:
      - Avoid implementing new solutions from scratch.
      - Operate with well-known technologies where they have a good
      know-how background, especially to face deployment and security
      issues.
      - Enrich their offers to customers.

3.  The CEM System

3.1  General description of the system

   The system SHOULD be mainly based on the standard Internet Mail
   Architecture [RFC5598]. In particular the system SHOULD allow to send
   certified email using a standard email client.

   We will use CEM-P to indicate a provider of Certified Mail.

   A CEM User (CEM-U) who wants to have a CEM Mailbox (CEM-M) MUST
   register it with one of these providers.

   The CEM-M can communicate both with other CEM-Ms worldwide and with
   Internet standard mailboxes.

   The communication between CEM-Ms MUST guarantee all the required
   features listed above.

   The communication between a CEM-M and a standard mailbox can
   guarantee some of the required features listed above.

                 |            |          |            |
                 +------------+          +------------+
                      CEM                     CEM
                     sender                 receiver
                    provider                provider


3.2  Possible scenario

   A user creates and sends a message with his email client using the
   SMTP server of the CEM-P with which he has registered his CEM-M. 

   The CEM-P MUST use a secure way to authenticate the author of the
   message. The author can sign the message personally with his own
   certificate (which MUST be compliant with S/MIME [RFC1847] [RFC5750]
   [RFC5751]) to generate the NRO evidence. If he doesn't do so, the
   CEM-P can do it on his behalf, depending on account configuration. 

   Once received, the sending CEM-P makes some checks on the message. If
   one of them fails, the system MUST reject the message and inform the
   sender about the reason of rejection. Otherwise, it will try to

Internet-Draft         Certified Electronic Mail       February 24, 2012


   forward the message to the final destination's CEM-P. In this case,
   the sending CEM-P releases an NRS evidence to the user.

   If the final destination is a CEM-M, the message will be sent to the
   receiver's CEM-P. After some checks to validate the CEM message, the
   receiving CEM-P releases a P-NRD evidence to the sending CEM-P,
   giving proof of the integrity of what it has received. If the checks
   fail, a negative P-NRD evidence is released. 

   The receiving CEM-P tries to deposit the message into the addressee's
   CEM-M. If this task is accomplished successfully, the receiving CEM-P
   releases an U-NRD evidence. Otherwise, a negative U-NRD evidence is
   released.

   The sending CEM-P monitors the transaction for the receipt of P-NRD
   and/or an U-NRD evidence (or their negative equivalents). If they're
   not received, the sending CEM-P releases a Timeout evidence. 

   If the sender requests an NRR evidence, the receiver MUST be able to
   provide it. The receiver SHOULD be able to provide this kind of
   evidence even if the sender doesn't request it explicitly.

3.3  Observations

   Analyzing the state of the art, it seems that most the necessary
   technologies are already available and standardized.

   Evidences in the CEM scenario could be generated by extending
   Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) [RFC3461][RFC3464] and Message
   Disposition Notifications (MDNs) [RFC3798].

   The registration of new MIME types and new mail header fields seems
   to be a good approach to define email messages in such a system.

   Both these techniques should be done in a way that maintains backward
   compatibility with older versions of email clients and supports
   interoperability with Internet standard mailboxes.

   As further step investigating if DKIM technologies [RFC5617][RFC6376]
   could be useful for Non-Repudiation needs.
