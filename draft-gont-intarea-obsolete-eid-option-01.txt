            Obsoleting the Endpoint Identifier (EID) Option
               draft-gont-intarea-obsolete-eid-option-01

Abstract

   This document formally deprecates the IPv6 Endpoint Identification
   (EID) option (hex value 0x8a), thus cleaning up the corresponding
   IANA registry, and possibly serving as a basis for providing advice
   about the filtering of packets containing this option.

Internet-Draft          Obsoleting the EID Option           October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Endpoint Identification option (hex value 0x8a) [EID-OPTION] was
   meant to be used with the Nimrod routing architecture [NIMROD-DOC],
   but has never seen widespread deployment.  Therefore, this document
   instructs IANA to change the "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop
   Options" registry [IANA-IPV6-PARAMETERS] accordingly (marking option
   0x8a as "Obsolete"), thus cleaning up the corresponding registry.

2.  Security Considerations

   This document does not modify the security properties of the IPv6
   option being deprecated.  However, formally deprecating this option
   may serve as a basis for e.g. providing advice about filtering
   packets containing such option (in a similar way to
   [I-D.ietf-opsec-ip-options-filtering] for the IPv4 case).

3.  IANA Considerations

   The "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options" registry
   [IANA-IPV6-PARAMETERS] contains the list of the currently assigned
   IPv6 option numbers.  This document formally deprecates the Endpoint
   Identification option, and requests IANA to mark it as such in the
   corresponding registry [IANA-IPV6-PARAMETERS].
