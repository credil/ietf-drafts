This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in TCP/IP-based
internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing Optical
Interfaces associated with WavelengthDivision Multiplexing systems or
characterized by the Optical Transport Network (OTN) in accordance
with the OTN architecture defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.872.

The MIB module defined in this memo can be used for performance
monitoring and/or configuration of such optical interface.

This document is a product of the AToM MIB Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
