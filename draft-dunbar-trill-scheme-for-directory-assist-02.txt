Internet-Draft  Scheme for Directory assisted RBridge


1. Introduction

   [TRILL-Directory-Framework] describes the framework for using
   directory servers to assist TRILL edge nodes to reduce multi-
   destination ARP/ND and unknow unicast flooding traffic, thus
   improving TRILL network scalability in data center environment. This
   draft describes the detailed mechanisms of using directory servers
   to assist RBridge edge nodes.

   Although this document describes directory servers as being part of
   RBridges, they may be separate end-stations devices (i.e. standalone
   directory servers), or servers connected to an RBridge that are
   advertising their ability of providing directory services.

2. Terminology

   AF      Appointed Forwarder RBridge port

   Bridge:  IEEE 802.1Q compliant device. In this draft, Bridge is used
             interchangeably with Layer 2 switch.

   DA:     Destination Address

   DC:      Data Center

   DDS:    Designated Directory Server for a specific VLAN or a group

             access switches in some data centers.

   VM:     Virtual Machines

3. Push Model of Directory Assisted RBridge Edge in DC Environment

   Under this model, Directory Server(s) push down the IP&MAC&VLAN <->
   RBridgeEdge mapping for all the hosts which might communicate with
   hosts attached to an RBridge edge node. With this environment, it is
   recommended that RBridge edge simply drop a data packet (instead of
   flooding to RBridge domain) if the packet's destination address
   can't be found in the IP&MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table.

   The mapping entry to be pushed down could leverage the gratuitous
   ARP reply or (Unsolicited) Neighbor Advertisement with extended
   fields showing the edge RBridge's name, as shown in Table 2.

   The push scheme can be accomplished by using the [ESADI] protocol
   with some simplification or a similar protocol. It has to be VLAN
   scoped.

   3.1. Minimize the mapping entries maintained by RBridge Edge

     One major drawback of the ''Push Model'' is that RBridge edge's
     MAC&VLAN<->RBridgeEdge mapping table will have more entries than
     it really needs.

     One simple step for an RBridge to reduce the number of mapping
     entries pushed down from directory is to prune out entries
     belonging to VIDs which are not enabled on its bridged LANs ports.
     For example, if only {vid#1, vid#2, vid#3} are enabled on bridged
     LANs connected to an RBridge edge ports, only MAC&VLAN<-
     >RBridgeEdge entries for those three VIDs need to be pushed down
     to the RBridge edge.

     To achieve this goal, RBridges need to subscribe directory
     services for the VLANs which they are interested in. Directory
     servers only send the directory information to an RBridge for the
     VLANs subscribed by the RBridge. This process eliminates
     unnecessary entries to be pushed down to RBridges.

     RBridges uses the same mechanism as ESADI protocol to announce all
     the VLANs which they are interested in.

Internet-Draft  Scheme for Directory assisted RBridge


   3.2.  Messages to trigger pushing from directory

     In push down model, it is necessary to have a message for RBridge
     node to request directory server(s) to start pushing down the
     mapping entries.

     RBridges uses the same mechanism as ESADI protocol to announce all
     the VLANs which they are interested in. The difference from ESADI
     is that ''Request for Directory'' message is sent to a well known
     multicast address for all the Push Directory Servers. All other
     RBridges who are not attached to any directory servers are not the
     members of this multicast group.

   3.3. Actions by Push Directory Servers

     A Push Directory Server could be directly attached to an RBridge
     or embedded in an RBridge through which VLAN scoped directory
     contents are pushed to other RBridges.

     A Push Directory Server could also be a standalone server which is
     capable of sending required LSPs to announce its ability and push
     the content to the subscribed RBridges. A standalone Push
     Directory is almost like a dummy RBridge node which participates
     in TRILL link state flooding, but doesn't perform RBridge's
     forwarding, encapsulating, or decapsulation of native Ethernet
     data frames.

     Push Directory servers advertise their availability by turning on
     a flag bit in the Interested VLANs sub-TLV [rfc6326bis] in their
     LSP for the VLAN or VLANs for which they offer Push Directory
     services. If more than one Directory Server is advertising that it
     can provide Push Directory Service for a particular VLAN, only the
     Directory Server associated with the RBridge with the highest
     System ID on the ESADI pseudo-link [EASDI] should push the
     information for that VLAN. Other Push Directory servers for that
     VLAN (presumably present for backup) SHOULD NOT push their
     directory information to avoid unnecessary duplication.

     The Directory Server with the highest System ID is called
     Designated Directory Server - DDS. Different ESADI pseudo-links
     [EASDI] could have different DDSs.

     There is a reserved Multicast Address for all Push Directory
     Servers.

   3.4. Applicable Components of ESADI used in Push Scheme

     RBridges that are not associated with any Push Directory Servers
     should only participate in ESADI for getting the mapping
     information for the interested VLAN, but SHOULD NOT advertise any
     locally learned MAC attachment information into ESADI.

     When a non-directory server RBridge detects that the information
     appears to be missing from the directory information, they can
     advertise the information only to the Push Directory Servers by
     using the well-known multicast address for the Push Directory
     Servers.  This behavior is different from ESADI protocol where the
     locally learned MAC attachment information is advertised to all
     RBridges who are interested in the VLANs.

     ESADI only advertises the locally learned MAC address. But the
     directory needs to push down IP/MAC/VLAN and their directly
     attached RBridges.

     [draft-eastlake-isis-ia-tlv] describes the TLVs to carry the VLAN
     scoped IP/MAC/VLAN information for all the hosts.

   3.5. Aggregated entries to push down

     Using Table 2 requires one entry per host/VM. When directory
     pushes down the entire mapping to an edge RBridge for the very
     first time, there usually are many entries. To minimize the amount
     of data pushed down, summarization should be considered, e.g. with
     one edge RBridge Nickname being associated with all attached
     hosts' MAC addresses and VLANs as shown below:

              Table 1: Summarized table pushed down from directory

       Whenever there is any change in MAC&VLAN <-> RBridgeEdge
       mapping, which can be triggered by hosts being added, moved, or
       de-commissioned, an incremental update can be sent to the
       RBridge edges which are impacted by the change.

4. Pull model of Directory Assisted RBridge Edge in DC Environment

   Under this model, ''RBridge'' pulls the VLAN scoped MAC<->IP<-
   >RBridgeEdge mapping entry from the directory server when needed.

   Pull Directory Servers for a particular VLAN are located by looking
   in the link state database for RBridges that advertise themselves by
   having the Pull Directory Server flag on in their Interested VLANs
   sub-TLV [rfc6326bis] for that VLAN. If multiple RBridges indicate
   that they are Pull Directory Servers for a particular VLAN, then
   pull requests can be sent to any of them.

   Pull Directory requests are sent to the RBridge, or a dummy RBridge,
   whose LSP contains the Interested VLANs sub-TLV advertising that it
   is a Pull Directory server for the relevant VLAN. These requests are
   sent by enclosing them in an RBridge Channel [Channel] message using
   the Pull Directory channel protocol number (see Section 8).
   Responses are returned in an RBridge Channel message using the same
   protocol number.

   The requests to Pull Directory Servers are derived from normal ARP
   [RFC826], ND [RFC4861], RARP [RFC903] messages intercepted by the
   RBridge, or data frame with unknown DA.

Internet-Draft  Scheme for Directory assisted RBridge


   However, additional information is desired from the directory server
   response in this case, such as the nickname to which an end station
   (probably identified by IP address) is attached. For this purpose,
   extended ARP op codes are specified in Table 2.

   For a Pull Request derived from an unknown data frame, the RBridge
   edge node can drop the data frame if there is no response from the
   directory server after X number of tries.

   The requesting RBridge node can cache the mapping and age out
   MAC&IP&VLAN entries if the entries haven't been used for a certain
   period of time. Therefore, each RBridge edge will only keep the
   entries which are frequently used, i.e. mapping table size can be
   smaller.

   The following table shows how target RBridge nickname can be
   attached to a standard ARP Reply when replying to an ARP request
   forwarded by ingress RBridge edge.

   attached. More bits are reserved for RBridge nicknames in case
   multiple levels of nicknames are needed in the future for large data
   centers.

   There are 16 bits for Operation type field in ARP message. IANA has
   assigned 0~25 for various purposes and leave 26~65534 unassigned
   [http://www.iana.org/assignments/arp-parameters/arp-parameters.xml].
   If this approach is taken, a new ARP Operation code has to be
   assigned by IANA.

5. Push-Pull Hybrid Model

   For some edge nodes which have great number of VIDs enabled,
   managing the MAC&VLAN <-> RBridgeEdge mapping for hosts under all
   those VIDs can be challenge. This is especially true for Data Center
   gateway nodes, which need to maintain majority of VIDs if not all.

   For those RBridge Edge nodes, hybrid model should be considered.
   I.e. Push model are used for some VIDs, and pull model are used for
   other VIDs. It can be operator's decision (i.e. by configuration) on
   which VIDs' mapping entries are pushed down from directory and which
   VIDs' mapping entries are pulled.

   For example, in a data center when hosts in specific VIDs (vid#1,
   vid#2, ? vid#100)communicate regularly with external peers, the
   mapping entries for those 100 VIDs should be pushed down to the data
   center gateway routers. For hosts in other VIDs which only
   communicate with external peers once a day (or once a few days) for
   management interface, the mapping entries for those VIDs should be
   pulled down from directory whenever the needs come up.

   The mechanisms described above for Push and Pull Directory services
   make it easy to use Push for some VIDs and Pull for others. In fact,
   different RBridges can even be configured so that some use Push
   Directory services and some use Pull Directory services for the same
   VID if both Push and Pull Directory services are available for that
   VID. And there can be VIDs for which directory services are not
   used.



6. Manageability Considerations

8. IANA Considerations

   There are 16 bits for ARP Operation type field [RFC826]. IANA has
   assigned 0~25 for various purposes and leave 26~65534 unassigned
   [http://www.iana.org/assignments/arp-parameters/arp-parameters.xml].
   If this approach is taken, IANA is requested to assign a new ARP
   Operation code for TRILL Directory Pull services.

   IANA is request to allocate a new RBridge Channel protocol number
   for Pull Directory Services.

   IANA is requested to allocate two currently reserved bits in the
   Interested VLANs field of the Interested VLANs and Spanning Tree
   Roots sub-TLV [rfc6326bis] to indicate directory servers and to
   create a sub-registry in the TRILL Parameters Registry, as follows:
