    <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">

	    <t>At IETF-87 (Berlin), it was suggested to review/summarize the CORE WG
		    interest on the topic of Sleepy Node support.  Specifically whether the WG feels that support
		    of sleepy endpoints is required for the CoAP protocol, 
		    CORE Link Format, CORE Resource Directory, etc.  Alternatively,
		    whether the WG feels that Sleepy Node support can be completely
		    done outside CORE such as in the lower Layer 2 (MAC) scheduling and/or
		    in Layer 7 (application) logic.

      </t>

  
    </section>




    <section anchor="Drafts" title="Drafts Related to Sleepy Nodes">

	    <t>There have been multiple drafts in the CORE WG related to the subject of Sleepy Nodes including:
	    
	    
	       <list style="symbols">

		   <t><xref target="I-D.rahman-core-sleepy-problem-statement"/> summarizes the overall problem space of Sleepy Nodes.</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.cao-core-aol-req"/> defines requirements for Sleepy Nodes to behave as if they are "always on".</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.dijk-core-sleepy-reqs"/> defines requirements for Sleepy Nodes based on home and building control use cases.</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.rahman-core-sleeping"/> defines general requirements for Sleepy Nodes.</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.bormann-core-roadmap"/> provides a classification and overview of CORE drafts (and features)
			   including a section on Sleepy Nodes.</t>		   

		   <t><xref target="I-D.arkko-core-sleepy-sensors"/> describes a sensor network implementation and shows how different communication
			   models affect implementation complexity and energy consumption (including Sleepy Node support).</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.giacomin-core-sleepy-option"/> defines a proxy that acts as a store-and-forward agent for a Sleepy Node.</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.castellani-core-alive"/> defines a new CoAP message type which the Sleepy Node 
			   multicasts to all interested devices when it wakes up.</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.fossati-core-publish-option"/> allows an endpoint to temporarily delegate authority of its
			  resources (when it is sleeping) to a proxy server that is always on.</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.fossati-core-monitor-option"/> extends the Observe functionality to handle the
			   scenario when both the server and clients are Sleepy Nodes.</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.dijk-core-sleepy-solutions"/> defines an architectural approach to support Sleepy Nodes.</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.rahman-core-sleepy"/> defines new parameters that describe an endpoint's sleepy characteristics and stores them
			   in the Resource Directory.</t>

		   <t><xref target="I-D.vial-core-mirror-server"/> defines a special type of Resource Directory from which
			   endpoints can fetch the resource regardless of the (sleep) state of the server.</t>

    <section anchor="Email" title="WG Email List Poll for Sleepy Node Deliverable">

	    <t>A poll was taken on the WG Email list asking the following question: "Should we have a CORE deliverable
		    for CoAP support of Sleepy Nodes?" <xref target="IETF87-Poll"/>.</t>

	    <t>The results of the poll were as follows:
	    
	    	<list style="symbols">
                   <t>Votes FOR a new CORE Sleepy Node support deliverable: 9</t>

                   <t>Votes AGAINST a new CORE Sleepy Node support deliverable: 3</t>
                </list>
	    
	    
	    </t>

    </section>


     <section anchor="Summary" title="Summary">

	     <t>There have been over ten drafts related to the concept of CORE support of Sleepy Nodes.  The WG Email list
		     poll on the topic had a large majority of responders supporting creation of a CORE charter item for support of Sleepy Nodes.
		     However there were some important and high profile dissenters that argued against such a charter item.  
		     Another point to consider is that during WG discussions, the CORE Mirror Server
		     <xref target="I-D.vial-core-mirror-server"/>  is sometimes referred to as the 
		     "existing" solution for CORE Sleepy Node support.  However, this draft was never adopted as a WG draft.</t>

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
