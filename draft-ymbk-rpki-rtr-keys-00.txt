                Router Key PDU for RPKI-Router Protocol
                      draft-ymbk-rpki-rtr-keys-00

Abstract

   The RPKI/Router Protocol v0 is specified to carry the PDUs necessary
   for RPKI-based Origin Validation.  For BGPsec Path Validation, the
   routers also need data extracted from BGPsec Router Certificates.
   This document adds a PDU to the RPKI/Router Protocol to carry those
   data.

Internet-Draft  Router Key PDU for RPKI-Router Protocol     October 2012


   This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not
   be created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-Draft.

1.  Introduction

   The RPKI/Router Protocol v0, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr], defines
   the PDUs necessary for RPKI-based Origin Validation.  For BGPsec Path
   Validation ([I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol]), the routers also need
   data extracted from BGPsec Router Certificates which are described in
   Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles].  This document
   adds a PDU to the RPKI/Router Protocol to carry those data.

   This is a temporary design document intended to work out the design
   of the PDU.  How the RPKI/Router protocol specification is enhanced
   to include this PDU will be dealt with later.

2.  The Data Needed by the Router

   As in the RPKI/Router protocol, very little of the data in the RPKI
   is actually needed by the router.  Only those data required by the
   router are carried in this PDU.  In addition to the normal
   boilerplate fields of an RPKI/Router PDU (Protocol Version, Serial
   Number, and Flags), the Router Key PDU has the following fields:

   PDU Type: An eight-bit unsigned integer with the value 9.

   AS Number: The 4-byte Autonomous System Number (AS or ASN) of the
      router extracted from [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles] Section
      3.1.1.1 (sic).

   Subject Key Identifier: The 20 octet subjectKeyIdentifier (SKI) as
      described in Section 4.8.2 of [RFC6487].

   Subject Public Key Info: The router's subjectPublicKeyInfo (SPKI) as
      described in section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-algs].  The
      first two octets of the SPKI are the Tag (currently 0x30) and the
      Length (currently 0x59) of the SPKI.  They are followed by an
      algorithmIdentifier and a subjectPublicKey.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the IANA to modify the registry for tuples of
   Protocol Version / PDU Type, to add the PDU Type 9 as follows:

      Protocol
      Version    PDU Type
      --------   -------------------
          0        9 - Router Key
