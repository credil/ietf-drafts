		<abstract>
			<t>This document updates RFC 2026 to no longer use STD 1 as
			a summary of "Internet Official Protocol Standards". It
			obsoletes RFC 5000 and requests the IESG to move RFC 5000
			(and therefore STD 1) to Historic status.</t>

		<section title="Retiring STD 1">
			<t><xref target="RFC2026">RFC 2026</xref> and its
			predecessors call for the publication of an RFC describing
			the status of IETF protocols:
				<list><t>The RFC Editor shall publish periodically an
				"Internet Official Protocol Standards" RFC [1], summarizing
				the status of all Internet protocol and service
				specifications.</t></list>
			The "Internet Official Protocol Standards" document, now as
			<xref target="RFC5000">RFC 5000</xref>, has always been
			listed in the Internet Standard series as STD 1. However,
			the document has not been kept up to date in recent years,
			and it has fallen out of use in favor of the online list
			produced by the RFC Editor <xref target="STDS-TRK" />. The
			IETF no longer sees the need for the document to be
			maintained. Therefore, this document updates <xref
			target="RFC2026">RFC 2026</xref>, effectively removing the
			above mentioned paragraph from section 6.1.3, along with the
			paragraph from section 2.1 that states:
				<list><t>The status of Internet protocol and service
				specifications is summarized periodically in an RFC entitled
				"Internet Official Protocol Standards" [1].  This RFC shows
				the level of maturity and other helpful information for each
				Internet protocol or service specification (see section 3).
				</t></list>
			and the paragraph from section 3.3 that states:
				<list><t>The "Official Protocol Standards" RFC (STD1) lists
				a general requirement level for each TS, using the
				nomenclature defined in this section. This RFC is updated
				periodically.  In many cases, more detailed descriptions of
				the requirement levels of particular protocols and of
				individual features of the protocols will be found in
				appropriate ASs. </t></list>
			Additionally, this document obsoletes <xref
			target="RFC5000">RFC 5000</xref>, the current incarnation of
			that document, and requests that the IESG move that document
			(and therefore STD 1) to Historic status. </t>
			<t>Finally, <xref target="RFC2026">RFC 2026</xref> section
			6.1.3 also calls for the publication of an "official summary
			of standards actions completed and pending" in the Internet
			Society's newsletter. This has also not been done in recent
			years, and the "publication of record" for standards actions
			has for some time been the minutes of the IESG. <xref
			target="IESG-MINUTES" /> Therefore, that paragraph is also
			effectively removed from section 6.1.3.</t>
