Abstract 

   Segment Routing (SR) [SR-ARCH] is a new MPLS paradigm in which each 
   SR-capable router is required to independently advertise global MPLS 
   labels for its attached prefixes using IGP [SR-ISIS-EXT][SR-OSPF-EXT]. 
   One major challenge associated with such label advertisement 
   mechanism is how to avoid a given global MPLS label from being 
   allocated by different routers to different prefixes. Although manual 
   allocation can address such label allocation collision problem, it is 
   error-prone and therefore may not be suitable for large SR network 
   environments. This document proposes an alternative approach for 
   advertising global labels without any risk of label allocation 
   collision.

Internet-Draft        Advertising Global Labels Using IGP     July 2013 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   Segment Routing (SR) [SR-ARCH] is a new MPLS paradigm in which each 
   SR-capable router is required to independently advertise global MPLS 
   labels for its attached prefixes using IGP [SR-ISIS-EXT][SR-OSPF-EXT]. 
   One major challenge associated with such label advertisement 
   mechanism is how to avoid a given global MPLS label from being 
   allocated by different routers to different prefixes. Although manual 
   allocation can address such label allocation collision problem, it is 
   error-prone therefore may not be suitable for large SR network 
   environments.  

   This document proposes an alternative approach for advertising global 
   labels without any risk of label allocation collision. The basic idea 
   of this approach is that a single mapping server would, on behalf of 
   all SR-capable routers within an IGP domain, allocate global labels 
   for prefixes attached to those SR-capable routers and then advertise 
   the label bindings in the IGP domain scope. Those prefixes which need 
   to be allocated with global labels can be manually configured on the 
   mapping servers or be advertised by the corresponding SR-capable 
   routers to which those prefixes are attached. In the multi-area/level 
   scenario where route summary between areas/levels is required, the IP 
   longest-match algorithm SHOULD be used by SR-capable routers when 
   processing label bindings advertised by the mapping server.  

   As for the scenario where the scope of label advertisement is set to 
   area/level-scoped, it will be discussed in a future version of this 
   document. 

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC1195] [RFC2328] [SR-
   ARCH].  

3. Advertising Label Bindings for Prefixes 

3.1. Extension to ISIS 

   A mapping server could uses one or more of the following TLVs to 
   advertise global labels for those prefixes which need to be allocated 
   with global labels: 

       TLV-135 (IPv4) [RFC5305] 

       TLV-235 (MT-IPv4) [RFC5120]

Internet-Draft        Advertising Global Labels Using IGP     July 2013 
 
       TLV-236 (IPv6) [RFC5308] 

       TLV-237 (MT-IPv6) [RFC5120] 

   A Label Binding Sub-TLV (TBD) as shown below is associated with a 
   prefix which is contained in one of the above TLVs:  

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

       Type: TBD 

       Length: 4 

       P-Flag: if set, the penultimate hop router MUST perform PHP 
       action on the allocated MPLS label. For a given prefix, the P-
       Flag in the Label Binding Sub-TLV MUST be set to the same value 
       as that of the P-Flag in the Label Request Sub-TLV if a label 
       request message (see section 4 of this document) for that prefix 
       is received by the mapping server. 

       MPLS Label: a global label for the prefix which is carried in the 
       TLV containing this sub-TLV. 

   Since the mapping server uses these TLVs for label binding 
   advertisement purpose other than building the normal IP routing table, 
   the Metric field MUST be set to a value larger than MAX_PATH_METRIC 
   (i.e., 0xFE000000). 

3.2. Extension to OSPFv2 

   A new Opaque LSA [RFC5250] of type 11 (with domain-wide flooding 
   scope), referred to as Prefix Opaque LSA, is defined. The opaque type 
   of this Prefix Opaque LSA is TBD. A mapping server could use one or 
   more Prefix Opaque LSAs to advertise label bindings for those 
   prefixes which need to be allocated with global labels.  

   One or more Prefix TLV (type code=TBD) as shown below could be 
   contained in a Prefix Opaque LSA.  

       0                   1                   2                   3

4. Requesting Label Bindings for Prefixes 

4.1. Extension to ISIS  

   When advertising IP reachability information by using one of the 
   Extended IP Reachability TLVs (i.e., TLV-135, TLV-235, TLV-236 and 
   TLV-237), SR-capable ISIS routers SHOULD mark those among their 
   attached prefixes which need to be allocated with a global label by 
   associating each of these prefixes with a Label Request sub-TLV (type 
   code=TBD) as shown below. 

       0                   1                   2                   3

       Type: TBD 

       Length: 4 

       P-Flag: if set, the penultimate hop router MUST perform PHP 
       action on the required label. 

   In the multi-level scenario where route summary between levels is 
   required, separate Extended IP Reachability TLVs other than those for 
   IP reachability advertisement purpose SHOULD be used for label 
   binding advertisement purpose. Since these separate TLVs are not used 
   for the purpose of building the normal IP routing table, the Metric 
   field MUST be set to a value larger than MAX_PATH_METRIC (i.e., 
   0xFE000000).

4.2. Extension to OSPFv2 

   SR-capable OSPF routers could use one or more Prefix Opaque LSAs as 
   defined in section 3.2 of this document to advertise those among 
   their attached prefixes which need to be allocated with global labels.  

   A new Sub-TLV of the Prefix TLV, referred to as Label Request Sub-TLV 
   (type code=TBD) as shown below is associated with a prefix which is 
   contained in a Prefix TLV.

       action. 

4.3. Extension to OSPFv3 

   TBD. 

5. Mapping Server Redundancy and Election 

   For redundancy purpose, more than one router could be configured as 
   candidates for mapping servers. Each candidate for mapping servers 
   SHOULD advertise its capability of being a mapping servers by using 
   IS-IS or OSPF Router Capability TLV. The one with the highest 
   priority SHOULD be elected as the primary mapping server which is 
   eligible to allocate and advertise global labels for prefixes on 
   behalf of SR-capable routers. The comparison of Router ID of ISIS or 
   OSPF routers breaks the tie between two or more candidates with the 
   same highest priority. Meanwhile, the one with the second highest 
   priority SHOULD be elected as a backup mapping server. This backup 
   mapping server is responsible for advertising the same label bindings 
   as those advertised by the primary mapping server. In this way, it's 
   possible to avoid unnecessary changes to the data plane (i.e., MPLS 
   forwarding table) of SR-capable routers in the event of mapping 
   server failover.

5.1. Extension to ISIS 

   Each candidate mapping server SHOULD advertise its capability of 
   being a mapping server and the corresponding priority for mapping 
   server election by attaching a Mapping Server Capability Sub-TLV 
   (type code=TBD) shown as below to an IS-IS Router Capability TLV 
   [RFC4971] with the S flag set (with domain-wide flooding scope).

       Priority: the priority for mapping server election. 

5.2. Extension to OSPFv2 

   Each candidate mapping server SHOULD advertise its capability of 
   being mapping servers by using an OSPF Router Informational 
   Capabilities TLV [RFC4970] contained in an Opaque LSA of type 11 
   (with domain-wide flooding scope). One of the unreserved OSPF Router 
   Informational Capabilities Bits is reserved for this purpose. 
   Furthermore, a sub-TLV (type code=TBD) as shown below is used to 
   convey the priority value for mapping server election.
