1.  Introduction

   This document describes constraints to the NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1
   protocols as well as the use of multi-domain capable file systems,
   name resolution services, and security services required to fully
   enable an NFSv4 multi-domain federated file system.

   The definition of an NFSv4 multi-domain federated file system
   combines these concepts:

   1.  NFSv4 Domain, Pseudo file system and referrals: The NFSv4.0
       [RFC3530] and NFSv4.1 [RFC5661] (hereafter referred to as NFSv4)
       protocols enable the construction of a distributed file system
       which can join NFSv4 servers from multiple NFSv4 domains, each
       potentially using separate name resolution services and separate
       security services, into a common multi-domain name space.

   2.  The Federated File System (FedFS): [RFC5716] describes the
       requirements and administrative tools to construct a uniform file
       server based namespace that is capable of spanning a whole
       enterprise and that is easy to manage.

   3.  Multi-domain capable filesystem: A local filesystem that uses a
       local ID form that can represent identities from both local and
       remote domains.  For example, an SSID based local ID form where
       the SSID contains both a domain and a user or group component.
       We note that many file systems exported by NFSv4 use 32 bit POSIX
       UID and GIDs as a local ID form and are therefore not domain
       aware and not able to participate in an NFSv4 multi-domain
       federated file system.  There are ways to overcome this
       deficiency, but these practices are beyond the scope of this
       document.

   An NFSv4 multi-domain federated file system uses the FedFS to join
   multiple NFSv4 domains each consisting of NFSv4 servers that export
   multi-domain capable filesystems, into a uniform NFSv4 server-based
   name space capable of spanning multiple enterprises.

2.  Terminology

      Name Service: provides the mapping between {NFSv4 domain, group or
      use name} and {NFSv4 domain, local ID} via lookups.  Can be
      applied to local or remote domains.  Often provided by a Directory
      Service such as LDAP.

      Domain: This term is used in multiple contexts where it has
      different meanings.  Here we provide specific definitions used in
      this document.

         DNS domain: a set of computers, services, or any internet
         resource identified by an DNS domain name [RFC1034].

         Security realm or domain: a set of configured security
         providers, users, groups, security roles, and security policies
         running a single security protocol and administered by a single
         entity.  E.g. a Kerberos Realm.  While a typical configuration
         is to use the uppercase DNS domain name as the Kerberos realm
         name they are independent.

         NFSv4 domain: a set of users, groups and computers running
         NFSv4 protocols running a single name service, and identified
         by a unique NFSv4 domain name.  See [RFC5661] Section 5.9
         "Interpreting owner and owner_group".  An NFSv4 domain can
         include multiple DNS domains and multiple security realms but
         only one name service.

         Multi-domain: In this document this always refers to multiple
         NFSv4 domains.

         FedFS domain: A file name space that can cross multiple shares
         on multiple file servers using file-access protocols such as
         NFSv4 or CIFS [CIFS].  A FedFS domain is typically a single
         administrative entity, and has a name that is similar to a DNS
         domain name.  Also known as a Federation.

         Administrative domain: a set of users, groups, computers and
         services administered by a single entity.  Can include multiple
         DNS domains, NFSv4 domains, security domains, and FedFS
         domains.

      Local representation of identity: an object such as a uidNumber
      (UID) or gidNumber (GID) [RFC2307], or a Windows Security
      Identifier (SID), or other such representation of a user or a
      group of users on-disk in a file system.

      Principal: an RPCSEC_GSS authentication identity.  Usually, but
      not always, a user; rarely, if ever, a group; sometimes a host.

      Authorization Context: A collection of information about a
      principal such as username, userID, group membership, etcetera
      used in authorization decisions.

3.  NFSv4 Server Identity Mapping

   NFSv4 deals with two kinds of identities: authentication identities
   (referred to here as "principals") and authorization identities
   ("users" and "groups" of users).  NFSv4 supports multiple
   authentication methods, each authenticating an "initiator principal"
   (typically representing a user) to an "acceptor principal" (always
   corresponding to the NFSv4 server).  NFSv4 does not prescribe how to
   represent authorization identities on file systems.  All file access
   decisions constitute "authorization" and are made by NFSv4 servers
   using authorization context information and file metadata related to
   authorization, such as a file's access control list (ACL).

   NFSv4 servers therefore must perform two kinds of mappings:

   1.  A mapping between the authentication identity and the
       authorization context information.

   2.  A mapping between the on-the-wire authorization identity
       representation and the on-disk authorization identity
       representation.

   Many aspects of these mappings are entirely implementation specific,
   but some require multi-domain capable name resolution and security
   services.  In order to interoperate in a multi-domain NFSv4 FedFS
   file system, NFSv4 servers must use such services in compatible ways.

4.  Multi-domain Constraints to the NFSv4 Protocol

   In order to service as many environments as possible, the NFSv4
   protocol is designed to allow administrators freedom to configure
   their NFSv4 domains as they please.  Joining NFSv4 domains under a
   single file namespace imposes slightly on this freedom.  Here we
   describe the required constraints.

4.1.  Name@domain Constraints

   NFSv4 uses a syntax of the form "name@domain" as the on wire
   representation of the "who" field of an NFSv4 access control entry
   (ACE) for users and groups.  This design provides a level of
   indirection that allows NFSv4 clients and servers with different
   internal representations of authorization identity to interoperate
   even when referring to authorization identities from different NFSv4
   domains.

   NFSv4 multi-domain capable sites need to meet the following
   requirements in order to ensure that NFSv4 clients and servers can
   map between name@domain and internal representations reliably:

   o  The NFSv4 domain portion of name@domain MUST be unique within the
      FedFS NFSv4 multi-domain namespace.  See [RFC3530] section 5.9
      "Interpreting owner and owner_group" for a discussion on NFSv4
      domain configuration.

   o  The name portion of name@domain MUST be unique within the
      specified NFSv4 domain.

   o  Every local representation of a user and of a group MUST have a
      canonical name@domain, and it must be possible to return the
      canonical name@domain for any identity stored on disk, at least
      when required infrastructure servers (such as name services) are
      online.

4.2.  RPC Security Constraints

   As described in [RFC5661] section 2.2.1.1 "RPC Security Flavors":

           NFSv4.1 clients and servers MUST implement RPCSEC_GSS.
           (This requirement to implement is not a requirement
           to use.) Other flavors, such as AUTH_NONE, and AUTH_SYS,
           MAY be implemented as well.

   The underlying RPCSEC_GSS security mechanism used in a multi-domain
   NFSv4 FedFS is REQUIRED to employ a method of cross NFSv4 domain
   trust so that a principal from a security service in one NFSv4 domain



Adamson & Williams       Expires April 20, 2014                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    NFSv4 Multi-Domain FedFS Requirements     October 2013


   can be authenticated in another NFSv4 domain that uses a security
   service with the same security mechanism.  Kerberos, and PKU2U
   [I-D.zhu-pku2u] are examples of such security services.

   The AUTH_NONE security flavor can be useful in a multi-domain NFSv4
   FedFS to grant universal access to public data without any
   credentials.

   The AUTH_SYS security flavor uses a host-based authentication model
   where the weakly authenticated host (the NFSv4 client) asserts the
   user's authorization identities using small integers, uidNumber and
   gidNumber [RFC2307], as user and group identity representations.
   Because this authorization ID representation has no DNS domain
   component, AUTH_SYS can only be used in a name space where all NFSv4
   clients and servers share an [RFC2307] name service.  A shared name
   service is required because uidNumbers and gidNumbers are passed in
   the RPC credential; there is no negotiation of namespace in AUTH_SYS.
   Collisions can occur if multiple name services are used.  AUTH_SYS
   can not be used in an NFSv4 multi-domain federated file system.

5.  Resolving Multi-domain Authorization Information

   When an RPCSEC_GSS principal is seeking access to files on an NFSv4
   server, after authenticating the principal, the server must obtain in
   a secure manner the principal's authorization context information
   from an authoritative source: e.g. the name service in the
   principal's NFSv4 domain.

   In the local NFSv4 domain case where the principal is seeking access
   to files on an NFSv4 server in the principal's NFSv4 home domain, the
   server administrator has knowledge of the local policies and methods
   for obtaining the principal's authorization information and the
   mappings to local representation of identity.  E.g. the administrator
   can configure secure access to the local NFSv4 domain name service.

   In the multi-domain case where a principal from a remote NFSv4 domain
   is seeking access to files on an NFSv4 server not in the principal's
   domain, there is no assumption of:

   o  remote name service configuration knowledge

   o  the form of the remote authorization context information presented
      to the NFSv4 server by the remote name service for mapping to a
      local representation.

   There are several methods the NFSv4 server can use to obtain the
   NFSv4 domain authoritative authorization information for a remote
   principal, listed in order of preference:

   1.  A mechanism specific GSS-API authorization payload containing
       credential authorization data described in the following section.
       This is the preferred method as it is part of the GSS-API
       authentication and avoids requiring any knowledge of a remote
       NFSv4 domain name service configuration, and has a set form of
       authorization context information to allow mapping to a local
       representation.

   2.  When there is a security agreement between the local and remote
       NFSv4 domain name services plus regular update data feeds, the
       NFSv4 server local NFSv4 domain name service can be authoritative
       for principal's in a remote NFSv4 domain.  In this case, the
       NFSv4 server makes a query to it's local NFSv4 domain name
       service just as it does when servicing a local domain principal.
       While this requires detailed knowledge of the remote NFSv4
       domains name service, the authorization context information
       presented to the NFSv4 server is in the same form as a query for
       a local principal.

Internet-Draft    NFSv4 Multi-Domain FedFS Requirements     October 2013


   3.  An authenticated direct query from the NFSv4 server to the
       principal's NFSv4 domain authoritative name service.  This
       requires the NFSv4 server to have detailed knowledge of the
       remote NFSv4 domain's authoritative name service and detailed
       knowledge of the form of the resultant authorization context
       information.

   Once the authorization context data for the remote principal has been
   obtained, the remote information must be mapped into local
   representations suitable for use in file system ACLs.  This is the
   first mapping described in Section 3.

5.1.  GSS-API Authorization Payload

   To avoid requiring detailed knowledge of remote NFSv4 domain name
   services, authorization context information SHOULD be obtained from
   the credentials authenticating a principal; the GSS-API represents
   such information as attributes of the initiator principal name.

   For example:

   o  Kerberos 5 [RFC4120] has a method for conveying "authorization
      data", both client-asserted as well as KDC-authenticated
      authorization data.  Some KDC implementation, notably Windows
      KDCs, use this feature to convey a "privilege attribute
      certificate" [PAC] listing the principal's user and group global
      IDs as "security identifiers" (SIDs).

   o  Some KDCs (will) issue Kerberos Tickets with the General PAD
      [I-D.sorce-krbwg-general-pac] (PAD) as Kerberos authorization data
      listing user and group names along with their uidNumber and
      gidNumber [RFC2307], the name of the DNS domain [ANDROS: review
      General PAD RFC to ensure this can be the NFSv4 domain] along with
      a unique DNS domain identifier and other information.  The General
      PAD authorization data MUST be authenticated in the sense that its
      contents must come from an authenticated, trusted source, such as
      a name server or the issuer of the principal's credential.

   o  PKIX [RFC5280] certificates allow for extensions that could be
      used similarly.

Internet-Draft    NFSv4 Multi-Domain FedFS Requirements     October 2013


6.  Setting and Retrieving NFSv4 Multi-domain ACLs

   When servicing a set acl request, the NFSv4 server must be able to
   map the name@domain in the ACE who field to a local representation of
   ID.  When servicing a get acl request, the NFSv4 server must be able
   to map the local representation of ID in the file system ACL to the
   name@domain form.  This mapping between name@domain and local
   representation of ID must [ANDROS: MUST?] be done against an
   authoritative source.  This is the second mapping described in
   Section 3.

   The local name-service is authoritative for these mappings for remote
   users and groups when one of the first two methods in (Section 5) is
   used to keep the local name-service updated with remote information.
