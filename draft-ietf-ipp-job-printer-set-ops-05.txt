This document is an OPTIONAL extension to the Internet Printing
Protocol (IPP/1.0 and IPP/1.1).  This document specifies 3 additional
OPTIONAL operations for use with the Internet Printing Protocol/1.0
(IPP) and IPP/1.1.  The end user, operator, and administrator
Set-Job-Attributes and Set-Printer-Attributes operations are used to
modify IPP Job objects and Printer objects, respectively.  The
Get-Printer-Supported-Values administrative operation returns values
that the IPP Printer will accept for setting its "xxx-supported"
attributes.

Group of the IETF.
