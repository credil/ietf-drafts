              draft-psarkar-rtgwg-rlfa-node-protection-02

Abstract

   The loop-free alternates computed following the current Remote-LFA
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] specification gaurantees only link-
   protection.  The resulting Remote-LFA nexthops (also called PQ-
   nodes), may not gaurantee node-protection for all destinations being
   protected by it.

   This document describes procedures for determining if a given PQ-node
   provides node-protection for a specific destination or not.  The
   document also shows how the same procedure can be utilised for
   collection of complete characteristics for alternate paths.
   Knowledge about the characteristics of all alternate path is
   precursory to apply operator defined policy for eliminating paths not
   fitting constraints.

Internet-DraftRemote-LFA Node Protection and Manageability November 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Remote-LFA [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] specification provides
   loop-free alternates that gaurantees only link-protection.  The
   resulting Remote-LFA alternate nexthops (also referred to as the PQ-
   nodes) may not provide node-protection for all destinations covered
   by the same, in case of failure of the primary nexthop node.  Neither
   does the specification provide a means to determine the same.

   Also, the LFA Manageability [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lfa-manageability]
   document, requires a computing router to find all possible (including
   all possible Remote-LFA) alternate nexthops, collect the complete set
   of path characteristics for each alternate path, run a alternate-
   selection policy (configured by the operator), and find the best
   alternate path.  This will require the Remote-LFA implementation to
   gather all the required path characteristics along each link on the
   entire Remote-LFA alternate path.

   With current LFA [RFC5286] and Remote-LFA implementations, the
   forward SPF (and reverse SPF) is run on the computing router and its
   immediate 1-hop routers as the roots.  While that enables computation
   of path attributes (e.g. SRLG, Admin-groups) for first alternate path
   segment from the computing router to the PQ-node, there is no means
   for the computing router to gather any path attributes for the path
   segment from the PQ-node to destination.  Consecutively any policy-
   based selection of alternate paths will consider only the path
   attributes from the computing router up until the PQ-node.

   This document describes a procedure for determining node-protection
   with Remote-LFA.  The same procedure are also extended for collection
   of complete set of path attributes, enabling more accurate policy-
   based selection for alternate paths obtained with Remote-LFA.

2.  Node Protection with Remote-LFA

2.1.  The Problem

   To better illustrate the problem and the solution proposed in this
   document the following topology diagram from the Remote-LFA
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] draft is being re-used with slight
   modification.

                                   R1---R2

                           Figure 1: Topology 1

   In the above topology, for all (non-ECMP) destinations reachable via
   the S-E link there is no standard LFA alternate.  As per the Remote-
   LFA [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] alternate specifications node R2
   being the only PQ-node for the S-E link provides nexthop for all the
   above destinations.  Table 1 below, shows all possible primary and
   Remote-LFA alternate paths for each destination.

    +-------------+--------------+---------+-------------------------+
    | Destination | Primary Path | PQ-node | Remote-LFA Backup Path  |
    +-------------+--------------+---------+-------------------------+
    | R3          | S->E->R3     | R2      | S=>N=>R1=>R2->R3        |
    | E           | S->E         | R2      | S=>N=>R1=>R2->R3->E     |
    | D1          | S->E->D1     | R2      | S=>N=>R1=>R2->R3->E->D1 |
    | D2          | S->E->R3->D2 | R2      | S=>N=>R1=>R2->R3->D2    |
    +-------------+--------------+---------+-------------------------+

              Table 1: Remote-LFA backup paths via PQ-node R2

   A closer look at Table 1 shows that, while the PQ-node R2 provides
   link-protection for all the destinations, it does not provide node-
   protection for destinations E and F. In the event of the node-failure
   on primary nexthop E, the alternate path from Remote-LFA nexthop R2
   to E and D1 also becomes unavailable.  So for a Remote-LFA nexthop to
   provide node-protection for a given destination, it is mandatory
   that, the shortest path from the given PQ-node to the given
   destination MUST not traverse the primary nexthop.

   In another extension of the topology in Figure 1 let us consider an
   additional link between N and E.

                                          D1
                                         /
                                    S-x-E
                                   /   / \
                                  N---+   R3--D2
                                   \     /
                                   R1---R2

                           Figure 2: Topology 2

   In the above topology, the S-E link is no more on any of the shortest
   paths from N to R3.  Hence R3 is also included in both the Extended-P
   space and PQ space of E (w.r.t S-E link).  Table 2 below, shows all
   possible primary and R-LFA alternate paths via PQ-node R3, for each

   destination reachable through the S-E link in the above topology.
   The R-LFA alternate paths via PQ-node R2 remains same as in Table 1.

     +-------------+--------------+---------+------------------------+
     | Destination | Primary Path | PQ-node | Remote-LFA Backup Path |
     +-------------+--------------+---------+------------------------+
     | R3          | S->E->R3     | R3      | S=>N=>E=>R3            |
     | E           | S->E         | R3      | S=>N=>E=>R3->E         |
     | D1          | S->E->D1     | R3      | S=>N=>E=>R3->E->D1     |
     | D2          | S->E->D1     | R3      | S=>N=>E=>R3->D2        |
     +-------------+--------------+---------+------------------------+

              Table 2: Remote-LFA backup paths via PQ-node R3

   Again a closer look at Table 2 shows that, unlike Table 1, where the
   single PQ-node R2 provided node-protection, for destinations R3 and
   G, if we choose R3 as the R-LFA nexthop, it does not provide node-
   protection for R3 and D1 anymore.  If S chooses R3 as the R-LFA
   nexthop, in the event of the node-failure on primary nexthop E, the
   alternate path from S to R-LFA nexthop R3 also becomes unavailable.
   So for a Remote-LFA nexthop to provide node-protection for a given
   destination, it is also mandatory that, the shortest path from S to
   the chosen PQ-node MUST not traverse the primary nexthop node.

2.2.  Few Additional Definitions

   This document adds and enhances the following definitions extending
   the ones mentioned in Remote-LFA [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] draft.

2.2.1.  Link-Protecting Extended P-Space

   The Remote-LFA [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] draft already defines
   this.  The link-protecting extended P-space for a link S-E being
   protected is the set of routers that are reachable from one or more
   direct neighbors of S, except primary node E, without traversing the
   S-E link on any of the shortest path from the direct neighbor to the
   router.  This MUST exclude any direct neighbor for which there is
   atleast one ECMP path from the direct neighbor traversing the
   link(S-E) being protected.

   A node Y is in link-protecting extended P-space w.r.t to the link
   (S-E) being protected, if and only if, there exists atleast one
   direct neighbor of S, Ni, other than primary nexthop E, that
   satisfies the following condition.

   D_opt(Ni,Y) < D_opt(Ni,S) + D_opt(S,E) + D_opt(E,Y)

   Where,

     D_opt(A,B) : Distance on most optimum path from A to B.
             E  : The primary nexthop on shortest path from S
                  to destination.
            Ni  : A direct neighbor of S other than primary
                  nexthop E.
             Y  : The node being evaluated for link-protecting
                  extended P-Space.


              Figure 3: Link-Protecting Ext-P-Space Condition

2.2.2.  Node-Protecting Extended P-Space

   The node-protecting extended P-space for a primary nexthop node E
   being protected, is the set of routers that are reachable from one or
   more direct neighbors of S, except primary node E, without traversing
   the node E. This MUST exclude any direct neighbors for which there is
   atleast one ECMP path from the direct neighbor traversing the node E
   being protected.

   A node Y is in node-protecting extended P-space w.r.t to the node E
   being protected, if and only if, there exists atleast one direct
   neighbor of S, Ni, other than primary nexthop E, that satisfies the
   following condition.


   D_opt(Ni,Y) < D_opt(Ni,E) + D_opt(E,Y)

   Where,
     D_opt(A,B) : Distance on most optimum path from R1 to B.
             E  : The primary nexthop on shortest path from S
                  to destination.
             Ni : A direct neighbor of S other than primary
                  nexthop E.
              Y : The node being evaluated for node-protecting
                  extended P-Space.


              Figure 4: Node-Protecting Ext-P-Space Condition

   It must be noted that a node Y satisfying the condition in Figure 4
   above only guarantees that the R-LFA alternate path segment from S
   via direct neighbor Ni to the PQ-node Y is not affected in the event
   of a node failure of E. It does not yet guarantee that the path
   segment from PQ-node Y to the destination is also unaffected by the
   same failure event.

2.2.3.  Q-Space

   The Remote-LFA [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] draft already defines
   this.  The Q-space for a link S-E being protected is the set of
   routers that can reach primary node E, without traversing the S-E
   link on any of the shortest path from the node Y to primary nexthop
   E.  This MUST exclude any destination for which there is atleast one
   ECMP path from the node Y to the primary nexthop E traversing the
   link(S-E) being protected.

   A node Y is in Q-space w.r.t to the link (S-E) being protected, if
   and only if, the following condition is satisfied.

   D_opt(Y,E) < D_opt(S,E) + D_opt(Y,S)

   Where,
     D_opt(A,B) : Distance on most optimum path from R1 to B.
             E  : The primary nexthop on shortest path from S
                  to destination.
             Y  : The node being evaluated for Q-Space.


                        Figure 5: Q-Space Condition

2.2.4.  Link-Protecting PQ Space

   A node Y is in link-protecting PQ space w.r.t to the link (S-E) being
   protected, if and only if, Y is present in both link-protecting
   extended P-space and the Q-space for the link being protected.

2.2.5.  Candidate Node-Protecting PQ Space

   A node Y is in candidate node-protecting PQ space w.r.t to the node
   (E) being protected, if and only if, Y is present in both node-
   protecting extended P-space and the Q-space for the link being
   protected.

   Again it must be noted that a node Y being in candidate node-
   protecting PQ-space does not guarantee that the R-LFA alternate path
   via the same, in entirety, is unaffected in the event of a node
   failure of primary nexthop node E. It only guarantees that the path
   segment from S to PQ-node Y is unaffected by the same failure event.
   The PQ-nodes in the candidate node-protecting PQ space may provide
   node protection for only a subset of destinations that are reachable
   through the corresponding primary link.

2.3.  Computing Node-protecting R-LFA Path

Internet-DraftRemote-LFA Node Protection and Manageability November 2013


   The R-LFA alternate path through a given PQ-node to a given
   destination comprises of two path segments as follows.

   1.  Path segment from the computing router to the PQ-node (Remote-LFA
       alternate nexthop), and

   2.  Path segment from the PQ-node to the destination being protected.

   So to ensure a R-LFA alternate path for a given destination provides
   node-protection we need to ensure that none of the above path
   segments are unaffected in the event of failure of the primary
   nexthop node.  Sections Section 2.3.1 and Section 2.3.2 shows how
   this can be ensured.

2.3.1.  Computing Candidate Node-protecting PQ-Nodes for Primary
        nexthops

   To choose a node-protecting R-LFA nexthop for a destination R3,
   router S needs to consider a PQ-node from the candidate node-
   protecting PQ-space for the primary nexthop E on shortest path from S
   to R3.  As mentioned in Section 2.2.2, to consider a PQ-node as
   candidate node-protecting PQ-node, there must be atleast one direct
   neighbor Ni of S, such that all shortest paths from Ni to the PQ-node
   does not traverse primary nexthop node E.

   Implementations should run the inequality in Section 2.2.2 Figure 4
   for all direct neighbor, other than primary nexthop node E, to
   determine whether a PQ-node Y is also a candidate node-protecting PQ-
   node.  All of the metrics needed by this inequality would have been
   already collected from the forward SPFs rooted at each of direct
   neighbor S, computed as part of standard LFA [RFC5286]
   implementation.  With reference to the topology in Figure 2, Table 3
   below shows how the above condition can be used to determine the
   candidate node-protecting PQ-space for S-E link (primary nexthop E)

   +-----------+----------+----------+----------+---------+------------+

   As seen in the above Table 3 , R3 does not meet the node-protecting
   extended-p-space inequality And so, while R2 is in candidate node-
   protecting PQ space, R3 is not.

   Some SPF implementations may also produce a list of links and nodes
   traversed on the shortest path(s) from a given root to others.  In
   such implementations, router S may have executed a forward SPF with
   each of it's direct neighbors as the SPF root, executed as part of
   the standard LFA [RFC5286] computations.  So S may re-use the list of
   links and nodes collected from the same SPF computations, to decide
   whether a PQ-node Y is a candidate node-protecting PQ-node or not.  A
   PQ-node Y shall be considered as a node-protecting, if and only if,
   there is atleast one direct neighbor of S, other than the primary
   nexthop E, for which, the primary nexthop node E does not exist on
   the list of nodes traversed on any of the shortest path(s) from the
   direct neighbor to the PQ-node.  Table 4 below is an illustration of
   the mechanism with the topology in Figure 2.

          Table 4: Protection of Remote-LFA tunnel to the PQ-node

   As seen in the above Table 4 while R2 is candidate node-protecting
   Remote-LFA nexthop for R3 and G, it is not so for E and F, since the
   primary nexthop E is in the shortest path from R2 to E and F.

2.3.2.  Computing node-protecting paths from PQ-nodes to destinations

   Once a computing router finds all the candidate node-protecting PQ-
   nodes for a given directly attached primary link, it shall follow the
   procedure in proposed in this section, to choose one or more node-
   protecting R-LFA paths, for destinations reachable through the same
   primary link in the primary SPF graph.

   To find a node-protecting R-LFA path for a given destination, the
   computing router needs to pick a subset of PQ-nodes from the
   candidate node-protecting PQ-space for the corresponding primary
   nexthop, such that all the path(s) from the PQ-node(s) to the given
   destination remain unaffected in the event of a node failure of

   primary nexthop node.  To ensure this, the computing router will need
   to ensure that, the primary nexthop node should not be on any of the
   shortest paths from the PQ-node to the given destination.

   This document proposes an additional forward SPF computation for each
   of the PQ-nodes, to discover all shortest paths from the PQ-nodes to
   the destination.  The additional forward SPF computation for each PQ-
   node, shall help determine, if a given primary nexthop node is on the
   shortest paths from the PQ-node to the given destination or not.  To
   determine if a given PQ-node provides node-protecting alternate for a
   given destination, the primary nexthop node should not be on any of
   the shortest paths from the PQ-node to the given destination.  After
   running the forward SPF on a PQ-node (from the node-protecting PQ-
   space) the computing router shall run the inequality in Figure 6
   below.  PQ-nodes that does not qualify the condition for a given
   destination, does not gaurantee node-protection for the path segment
   from the PQ-node to the given destination.

   D_opt(Y,D) < D_opt(Y,E) + Distance_opt(E,D)

   Where,
     D_opt(A,B) : Distance on most optimum path from R1 to B.
             D  : The destination node.
             E  : The primary nexthop on shortest path from S
                  to destination.
             Y  : The node-protecting PQ-node being evaluated

      Figure 6: Node-Protecting Condition for PQ-node to Destination

   All of the above metric costs except D_opt(Y, D), can be obtained
   with forward and reverse SPFs with E(the primary nexthop) as the
   root, run as part of the regular LFA and Remote-LFA implementation.
   The Distance_opt(Y, D) metric can only be determined by the
   additional forward SPF run with PQ-node Y as the root.  With
   reference to the topology in Figure 2, Table 5 below shows how the
   above condition can be used to determine node-protection with node-
   protecting PQ-node R2.

    Table 5: Node-protection evaluation for R-LFA path segment between
                          PQ-node and destination

   As seen in the above example above, R2 does not meet the node-
   protecting inequality for destination E, and F. And so, once again,
   while R2 is a node-protecting Remote-LFA nexthop for R3 and G, it is
   not so for E and F.

   In SPF implementations that also produce a list of links and nodes
   traversed on the shortest path(s) from a given root to others, to
   determine whether a PQ-node provides node-protection for a given
   destination or not, the list of nodes computed from forward SPF run
   on the PQ-node, for the given destination, should be inspected.  In
   case the list contains the primary nexthop node, the PQ-node does not
   provide node-protection.  Else, the PQ-node guarantees node-
   protecting alternate for the given destination.  Below is an
   illustration of the mechanism with candidate node-protecting PQ-node
   R2 in the topology in Figure 2.

        Table 6: Protection of Remote-LFA path between PQ-node and
                                destination

   As seen in the above example while R2 is candidate node-protecting
   R-LFA nexthop for R3 and G, it is not so for E and F, since the
   primary nexthop E is in the shortest path from R2 to E and F.

   The procedure described in this document helps no more than to
   determine whether a given Remote-LFA alternate provides node-
   protection for a given destination or not.  It does not find out any
   new Remote-LFA alternate nexthops, outside the ones already computed
   by standard Remote-LFA procedure.  However, in case of availability
   of more than one PQ-node (Remote-LFA alternates) for a destination,

   and node-protection is required for the given primary nexthop, this
   procedure will eliminate the PQ-nodes that do not provide node-
   protection and choose only the ones that does.

2.3.3.  Limiting extra computational overhead

   In addition to the extra reverse SPF computation, one per directly
   connected neighbor, suggested by the Remote-LFA
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] draft, this document proposes a forward
   SPF per PQ-node discovered in the network.  Since the average number
   of PQ-nodes found in any network is considerably more than the number
   of direct neighbors of the computing router, the proposal of running
   one forward SPF per PQ-node may add considerably to the overall SPF
   computation time.

   To limit the computational overhead of the approach proposed, this
   document proposes that implementations MUST choose a subset from the
   entire set of PQ-nodes computed in the network, with a finite limit
   on the number of PQ-nodes in the subset.  Implementations MUST choose
   a default value for this limit and may provide user with a
   configuration knob to override the default limit.  Implementations
   MUST also evaluate some default preference criteria while considering
   a PQ-node in this subset.  Finally, implementations MAY also allow
   user to override the default preference criteria, by providing a
   policy configuration for the same.

   A suggested default criteria for PQ-node selection will be to put a
   score on each PQ-node, proportional to the number of primary
   interfaces and remote destination routers being protected by it, and
   then pick PQ-nodes based on this score.  A more appropriate
   heuristsics can be devised, based on in-depth study of coverage
   provided by R-LFA, in the networks where they are mostly deployed.
   The same can then be used for PQ-node selection.

   Once a subset of PQ-nodes is found, computing router shall run a
   forward SPF on each of the PQ-nodes in the subset to continue with
   procedures proposed in section Section 2.3.2.

3.  Manageabilty of Remote-LFA Alternate Paths

3.1.  The Problem

   With the regular Remote-LFA [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa] functionality
   the computing router may compute more than one PQ-node as usable
   Remote-LFA alternate nexthops.  Additionally an alternate selection
   policy may be configured to enable the network operator to choose one
   of them as the most appropriate Remote-LFA alternate.  For such
   policy-based alternate selection to run, all the relevant path

   characteristics for each the alternate paths (one through each of the
   PQ-nodes), needs to be collected.  As mentioned befor in section
   Section 2.3 the R-LFA alternate path through a given PQ-node to a
   given destination comprises of two path segments.

   The first path segment (i.e. from the computing router to the PQ-
   node) can be calculated from the regular forward SPF done as part of
   standard and remote LFA computations.  However without the mechanism
   proposed in section Section 2.3.2 of this document, there is no way
   to determine the path characteristics for the second path segment
   (i.e from the PQ-node to the destination).  In the absence of the
   path characteristics for the second path segment, two Remote-LFA
   alternate path may be equally preferred based on the first path
   segments characteristics only, although the second path segment
   attributes may be different.

3.2.  The Solution

   The additional forward SPF computation proposed in section
   Section 2.3.2 document shall also collect links, nodes and path
   characteristics along the second path segment.  This shall enable
   collection of complete path characteristics for a given Remote-LFA
   alternate path to a given destination.  The complete alternate path
   characteristics shall then facilitate more accurate alternate path
   selection while running the alternate selection policy.
