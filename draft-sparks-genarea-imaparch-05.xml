The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work. This often involves
accessing the archived history of those email lists. Participants would
like to have the ability to browse and search those archives using standard IMAP clients.
This memo captures the requirements for providing a service that would allow such

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>
The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work. This often involves
accessing the archived history of those email lists. Requirements for improved
web-based browsing and searching of these archives are captured in <xref target="RFC6778"/>.
Participants would like to have the ability to browse and search those archives using standard IMAP clients.
This memo captures the requirements for providing a service that would allow such browsing and searching. 
</t>
<t>
Discussion of this memo should take place on the ietf@ietf.org mailing list.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Requirements for IMAP access to archived IETF lists">
<t>Many participants would prefer to access the list archives using IMAP <xref target="RFC3501"/>. Providing this access while meeting the following requirements will likely require an IMAP server with specialized capabilities.</t>
<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="o">The system should expose the archive using an IMAP interface, with each list
represented as a mailbox.</t>
<t hangText="o">This interface must work with standard IMAP clients.</t>
<t hangText="o">The interface should allow users that have provided credentials to each have their own read/unread marks for messages. Allowing other annotation is desirable. The implementation should consider taking advantage of the IMAP extensions for ANNOTATE <xref target="RFC5257"/> and METADATA <xref target="RFC5464"/>.</t>
<t hangText="o">The interface must have server-side searching enabled, and should support multiple simultaneous extensive searches. The server should facilitate
the enhanced search capabilities described in <xref target="RFC6778"/>. The implementation should consider taking advantage of the extensions defined for IMAP SORT and THREAD <xref target="RFC5256"/>, multimailbox search <xref target="RFC6237"/>, and fuzzy search <xref target="RFC6203"/>.</t>
<t hangText="o">When the system requires credentials, it must use the datatracker's authentication system
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="-">While the vast majority of archived lists have an open access policy, some archived lists have restricted archives.  The system must make it possible to limit access to a restricted archive based on login credentials.</t>
<t hangText="-">The system must not require credentials for accessing lists with open archives. (But it is acceptable for a user to access such archives while providing credentials).</t>
</list></t>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
   Allowing IMAP as an interface for browsing and searching the archives of IETF email lists does not affect
   the security of the Internet in any significant fashion.
</t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>
This document has no actions for IANA.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Acknowledgements">
<t>
This text was derived directly from an early version of the Internet Draft that became <xref target="RFC6778"/> 
which incorporated text suggestions from Alexey Melnikov, Pete Resnick, and S. Moonesamy. Barry Leiba suggested
several references to IMAP extensions for an implementation to consider.
