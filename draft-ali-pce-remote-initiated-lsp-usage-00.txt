     Abstract 

     When active stateful PCE is used for managing PCE-initiated LSP, 
     PCC may not be aware of the intended usage of the LSP (e.g., in a 
     multi-layer network). PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated MPLS and 
     GMPLS LSP Setup specifications do not address this requirement. 
     This draft addresses the requirement to specify on how PCC should 
     use the remote initiated LSPs.

     Internet-Draft    draft-ali-pce-remote-initiated-lsp-usage-00.txt 
      
     1. Introduction 

        [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] and [I-D. draft-ali-
        pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp] describe the setup and teardown 
        of PCE-initiated MPLS and GMPLS LSPs under the active stateful 
        PCE model, without the need for local configuration on the PCC, 
        thus allowing for a dynamic network that is centrally controlled 
        and deployed. However, when an active stateful PCE is used for 
        managing remote-initiated MPLS or GMPLS LSP, the PCC may not be 
        aware of the intended usage of the remote-initiated LSP. For 
        example, the PCC may not know the target IGP instance in which 
        the remote-initiated LSP is to be used. These requirements are 
        outlined in Section 3.  

        This draft addresses the requirement to specify on how PCC 
        should use the PCEP initiated LSPs. This is achieved by using 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object defined in [RFC6107] in PCEP, as 
        detailed in Section 4. PCEP extensions specified in this 
        document are equally applicable to PCEP initiated MPLS as well 
        as GMPLS LSPs.  

     2. Use Cases 

     2.1. Bandwidth-on-demand  

        This use case assumes there is a multi-layer network composed by 
        routers and optical equipment. In this scenario, there is an 
        entity, which decides it needs extra bandwidth between two 
        routers. This certain moment a GMPLS LSP connecting both routers 
        via the optical network can be established on-the-fly. This 
        entity can be a router, an active stateful PCE or even the NMS 
        (with or without human intervention).

                     [See PDF version of the document for Figures]                                           
                                              
         Figure 1. Bandwidth on demand use case 

        It is important to note that the bandwidth-on-demand interfaces 
        and spare bandwidth in the optical network could be shared to 
        cover many under capacity scenarios in the L3 network. For 
        example, in this use-case, if we assume all interfaces are 10G 
        and there is 10G of spare bandwidth available in the optical 
        network, the spare bandwidth in the optical network can be used 
        to connect any router, depending on bandwidth demand of the 
        router network. For example, if there are three routers, it is 
        not known a priori if the demand will make bandwidth-on-demand 
        interface at R1 to be connected to bandwidth-on-demand interface 
        at R2 or R3. For this reason, bandwidth-on-demand interfaces 
        cannot be pre-provisioned with the IP services that are expected 
        to carry. Furthermore, in this example, as active stateful PCE 
        is used for managing PCE-initiated LSP, PCC may not be aware of 
        the intended usage of the PCE-initiated LSP. Specifically, when 
        the PCE1 initiated GMPLS tunnel1, PCC does not know the IGP 
        instance whose demand leads to establishment of the GMPLS 
        tunnel1 and hence does not know the IGP instance in which the 
        GMPLS tunnel1 needs to be advertised. Similarly, the PCC does 
        not know IP address that should be assigned to the GMPLS 
        tunnel1. In the above example, this IP address is labeled as 
        TUN-IP-R1 (tunnel IP address at R1). The PCC also does not know 
        if the tunnel needs to be advertised as forwarding and/ or 
        routing adjacency and/or to be locally used by the target IGP 
        instance. Similarly, egress node for GMPLS signaling (R2 node in 
        this example) may not know the intended usage of the tunnel 
        (tunnel1 in this example). For example, the R2 node does not 
        know IP address that should be assigned to the GMPLS tunnel1. In 
        the above example, this IP address is labeled as TUN-IP-R2

        (tunnel IP address at R2). Section 4 of this draft addresses the 
        requirement to specify on how PCC and egress node for signaling 
        should use the remote initiated LSPs.  

     3. Remote Initiated LSP Usage Requirement 

        The requirement to specify usage of the LSP to the PCC includes 
        but not limited to specification of the following information.  

        -  The target IGP instance for the Remote-initiated LSP needs to 
          be specified.  

        -  In the target IGP instance, should the PCE-initiated LSP be 
          advertised as a forwarding adjacency and/ or routing adjacency 
          and/ or to be used locally by the PCC?   

        -  Should the as Remote-initiated LSP be advertised an IPv4 FA/ 
          RA, IPv6 FA/ RA or as unnumbered FA/ RA.  

        -  If Remote-initiated LSP is to be advertised an IPv4 FA/ RA, 
          IPv6 FA/ RA, what is the local and remote IP address is to be 
          used for the advertisement.  

     4. PCEP extension for PCEP Initiated LSP Usage Specification 

        The requirement to specify on how PCC should use the PCEP 
        initiated LSPs in outlined in Section 2. This subsection 
        specifies PCEP extension used to satisfy this requirement.  

     4.1. LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object in LSP Initiate Message 

        [RFC6107] defines LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object for 
        communicating usage of the forwarding or routing adjacency from 
        the ingress node to the egress node. This document extends the 
        LSP Initiate (PCInitiate) Message to include 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object defined in [RFC6107]. Object 
        class and type for the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object are as 
        follows:  

        Object Name: LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID 

        Object-Class Value: TBA by Iana (suggested value: 40)  

        Object-type: 1 

        The contents of this object are identical in encoding to the 
        contents of the RSVP-TE LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object defined 
        in [RFC6107] and [RFC3477]. The following TLVs of RSVP-TE 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object are acceptable in this object. 
        The PCEP LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object's TLV types correspond 
        to RSVP-TE LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object's TLV types. Please

        note that use of TLV type 1 defined in [RFC3477] is not 
        specified by this document.  

        TLV   TLV 
        Type  Description                                     Reference 
        --  ------------------------------------------------- ---------- 
        2  IPv4 interface identifier with target IGP instance [RFC6107] 

        3  IPv6 interface identifier with target IGP instance [RFC6107] 

        4  Unnumbered interface with target IGP instance      [RFC6107] 

        The meanings of the fields of PCEP LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID 
        object are identical to those defined for the RSVP-TE 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object. Similarly, meanings of the 
        fields of PCEP LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object's supported TLV 
        are identical to those defined for the corresponding RSVP-TE 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object's TLVs. The following fields have 
        slightly different usage.  

       -  IPv4 Interface Address field in IPv4 interface identifier 
          with target IGP instance TLV: This field indicates the local 
          IPv4 address to be assigned to the tunnel at the PCC (ingress 
          node for RSVP-TE signaling). In the example use case of 
          Section 2, IP address TUN-IP-R1 (tunnel IP address at R1) is 
          carried in this field (if TUN-IP-R1 is a v4 address).  

       -  IPv6 Interface Address field in IPv4 interface identifier 
          with target IGP instance TLV: This field indicates the local 
          IPv6 address to be assigned to the tunnel at the PCC (ingress 
          node for RSVP-TE signaling).  

       -  LSR's Router ID field in Unnumbered interface with target IGP 
          instance: The PCC SHOULD use the LSR's Router ID in Unnumbered 
          interface with target IGP instance in advertising the LSP 
          being initiated by the PCE.  

       -  Interface ID (32 bits) field in unnumbered interface with 
          target IGP instance: All bits of this field MUST be set to 0 
          by the PCE server and MUST be ignored by PCC. PCC SHOULD 
          allocate an Interface ID that fulfills Interface ID 
          requirements specified in [RFC3477].  

        When the Ingress PCC receives an LPS Request Message with 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID TLV, it uses the information contained 
        in the TLV to drive the IGP instance, treatment of the LSP being 
        initiated in the target IGP instance (e.g., FA, RA or local 
        usage), the local IPv4 or IPv6 address or router-id for 
        unnumbered case to be used for advertisement of the LSP being 
        instantiated.

     4.2. Communicating LSP usage to Egress node 

        PCE does not need to send LSP Initiate message to egress node to 
        communicate LSP usage information. Instead PCC (Ingres signaling 
        node) uses RSVP-TE signaling mechanism specified in [RFC6107] to 
        send the LSP usage to Egress node. Specifically, when the 
        Ingress PCC receives an LPS Request Message with 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID TLV, it SHOULD add 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object in RSVP TE Path message. For this 
        purpose, it is RECOMMENDED that the ingress PCC use content of 
        the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID TLV in LSP Initiate Message in PCEP 
        to drive LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object in RSVP-TE. This 
        document does not modify usage of LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object 
        in RSVP-TE signaling as specified in [RFC6107].  

        The egress node uses information contained in the 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object in RSVP-TE Path message to drive 
        the IGP instance, treatment of the LSP being initiated in the 
        target IGP instance (e.g., FA, RA or local usage), the local 
        IPv4 or IPv6 address or router-id for unnumbered case to be used 
        for advertisement of the LSP being instantiated.  

     5. Security Considerations 

        To be added in future revision of this document.  

     6. IANA Considerations  

     6.1. END-POINT Object  

        This document extends the LSP Initiate Message to include 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object defined in [RFC6107]. Object 
        class and type for the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object are as 
        follows:  

        Name                       Class value                      Type
