        Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network over IEEE 802.1Qbg
                   draft-sarikaya-proxy-vxlan-00.txt

Abstract

   In data centers there is interest in offloading network functions to
   the switches in order to keep the server focused on computation not
   networking.  IEEE 802.1Qbg or Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA)
   at the hypervisor simply forces each VM frame sent out to the
   external switch regardless of destination.  In this case, the
   eXtensible Local Area Network operation or proxying at a higher level
   switch is needed.  Communication functions of the eXtensible Local
   Area Network are moved above to the Top of Rack switches.  Top of
   Rack switch encapsulates the packets and directs them to their
   destination.  Packets from the eXtensible Local Area Network servers
   are decapsulated before sending it to the destination proxy servers.

1.  Introduction

   Data center networks are being increasingly used by telecom operators
   as well as by enterprises.  Currently these networks are organized as
   one large Layer 2 network in a single building.  In some cases such a
   network is extended geographically using virtual Local Area Network
   (VLAN) technologies still as an even larger Layer 2 network
   connecting the virtual machines (VM), each with its own MAC address.

   Another important requirement was growing demand for multitenancy,
   i.e. multiple tenants each with their own isolated network domain.
   In a data center hosting multiple tenants, each tenant may
   independently assign MAC addresses and VLAN IDs and this may lead to
   potential duplication.

   What we need is IP based tunneling scheme based overlay network
   called Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN).  VXLAN overlays
   a Layer 2 network over a Layer 3 network.  Each overlay is identified
   by the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI).  This allows up to 16M VXLAN
   segments to coexist within the same administrative domain
   [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan].  In VXLAN, each MAC frame is
   transmitted after encapsulation, i.e. an outer Ethernet header, an

   IPv4/IPv6 header, UDP header and VXLAN header are added.  Outer
   Ethernet header indicates an IPv4 or IPv6 payload.  VXLAN header
   contains 24-bit VNI.

   VXLAN tunnel end point (VTEP) is the hypervisor on the server which
   houses the VM.  VXLAN encapsulation is only known to the VTEP, the VM
   never sees it.  Also the tunneling is stateless, each MAC frame is
   encapsulated independent on any other MAC frame.

   Instead of using UDP header, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
   encapsulation can be used.  A 24-bit Virtual Subnet Identifier (VSID)
   is placed in the GRE key field.  The resulting encapsulation is
   called Network Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (NVGRE) [I-D.sridharan-virtualization-nvgre].  Note that VSID is
   similar to VNI.  Although VXLAN terminology is used throughout, the
   protocol defined in this document applies to VXLAN as well as NVGRE.

   One deployment strategy for VXLAN is to upgrade data center server
   hypervisors for VXLAN compatibility.  Data center servers that can
   not be upgraded can also be given VXLAN capability using proxying.
   For proxying to work, IEEE 801.1Qbg [IEEE802.1Qbg] or Virtual
   Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) functionality is needed in legacy
   server hypervisors.

   In a virtual server environment the most common way to provide
   Virtual Machine (VM) switching connectivity is a Virtual Ethernet
   Bridge (VEB) or a vSwitch.  VEP acts similar to a Layer 2 hardware
   switch providing inbound/outbound and inter-VM communication.  VEP
   aggregates multiple VMs traffic across a set of links as well as
   provides frame delivery between VMs based on MAC address. .

   However VEB lacks network management, monitoring and security, IEEE
   801.1Qbg or Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) provides a simple
   solution.  VEPA simply sends each VM frame out to the external switch
   regardless of destination to be handled by an external switch, i.e.
   Proxy VXLAN switch.

   VXLAN is a server-based network virtualization solution, and
   hypervisors are responsible for all networking work.  At the same
   time, IEEE 801.1Qbg [IEEE802.1Qbg] follows a total different
   philosophy that servers should do as little as possible networking
   job, and it defines a way for virtual switches to send all traffic
   and forwarding decisions to the adjacent physical switch.  This
   removes the burden of VM forwarding decisions and network operations
   from the host CPU.  It also leverages the advanced management
   capabilities in the access or aggregation layer switches.

   In this document, we develop Proxy VXLAN switch behavior.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan]

3.  Problem Statement

   In a virtual server environment the most common way to provide
   Virtual Machine (VM) switching connectivity is a Virtual Ethernet
   Bridge (VEB) or a vSwitch.  VEB acts similar to a Layer 2 hardware
   switch providing inbound/outbound and inter-VM communication.  VEP
   aggregates multiple VMs traffic across a set of links as well as
   provides frame delivery between VMs based on MAC address.  There are
   a number of disadvantages for VEB solution.  First of all, vSwitch
   consumes valuable CPU and memory bandwidth.  The higher the traffic
   load, the greater the number of CPU and memory cycles required to
   move traffic through the vSwitch, reducing the ability to support
   larger numbers of VMs in a physical server.  Secondly, the solution
   lacks network-based visibility.vSwitches have a limited feature set.
   They don't provide local traffic visibility or have capabilities for
   enterprise data monitoring, security, or network management.  Finaly,
   it lacks network policy enforcement.  Modern external switches have
   many advanced features such as port security, quality of service
   (QoS), and access control lists (ACL).  But vSwitches often do not
   have, or have limited support for such features.

   To solve the management challenges with VEBs, Edge Virtual Bridging
   (EVB) in the IEEE 802.1Qbg standard was proposed.  The primary goals
   of EVB are to combine the best of software and hardware vSwitches
   with the best of external L2 network switches.  EVB is based on VEPA
   (Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator) technology.  It is a way for
   virtual switches to send all traffic and forwarding decisions to the
   adjacent physical switch.  This removes the burden of VM forwarding
   decisions and network operations from the host CPU.  It also
   leverages the advanced management capabilities in the access or
   aggregation layer switches.

   VXLAN idea is mainly developed on vSwitch not IEEE 802.1Qbg. To
   accommodate IEEE 802.1Qbg, Proxy VXLAN is proposed in this document.

4.  Proxy VXLAN Architecture

   Proxy VXLAN is composed of servers that can host virtual machines.
   The servers are not involved in any communications required by VXLAN.
   This function is moved to the switches above the server.  Top of Rack
   switches are examples of switches that can host proxy functions, i.e.
   VXLAN Tunnel End Point, VTEPs.  Servers support IEEE 802.1Qbg.

   VTEPs receive raw packets from the servers and send packets upstream
   after VXLAN encapsulation.  Proxy VXLAN is assumed to be connected to
   VXLAN enabled servers.  VTEP in a Proxy VLAN architecture always tags
   the outgoing frames to let VXLAN enabled servers know that these
   frames are proxied.

   A given ToR switch hosting VTEP can serve one of more legacy servers.
   Virtual machine creation/deletion is done by the management center.

5.  Overview of the protocol

   The steps involved in the protocol are explained below:

   Encapsulation/Decapsulation of Frames

      In a hybrid Proxy VXLAN, when a frame is received on the VXLAN
      connected interface, the proxy switch decapsulates the frame and
      forwards the packet to the non VXLAN server.  When an incoming
      frame from the non-VXLAN interface is received, the proxy switch
      encapsulates it and forwards it to the VXLAN server.

   Virtual Machine Creation

      Virtual machine creation is initiated by the management center.
      The management center notifies a given non-VXLAN server to create
      a VM.  The center assigned a MAC address and VXLAN Network
      Identifier to the VM.

   VTEP Notification  Management Center notifies the ToR switch that is
      responsible for the server of this newly created virtual machine.
      The center sends MAC address, VNI of the virtual machine to the
      ToR switch which will act as the VTEP for this VM.

   Virtual Machine Operation  Virtual machine execution usually starts
      with ARP/ND Request to get the IP address of the destination
      virtual machine.  After ARP/ND, virtual machine enters into IP
      communication with the destination virtual machine.

6.  Encapsulation/Decapsulation Operation

   In a hybrid Proxy VXLAN, when a frame is received on the VXLAN
   connected interface, the proxy switch removes the VXLAN header.  It
   checks the destination MAC address of the inner Ethernet frame and
   forwards the packet to a physical port based on this MAC address.
   When an incoming frame from the non-VXLAN interface is received, the
   proxy switch first adds a VXLAN header.  VXLAN Network ID (VNI) is
   set to the value which is provided by the management center.  I Flag
   is set to 1.  A new flag, P flag is set to 1 to indicate that this
   frame is coming from Proxy VXLAN.

   Source port is assigned by the proxy switch.  Destination port is set
   to 4789.  UDP checksum is set to zero.

   Source IPv4/v6 address is the proxy switch IPv4/v6 address.
   Destination IPv4/v6 address is obtained based on the inner
   destination MAC address.  It is a multicast address if the incoming
   frame belongs to ARP/ND or multicast communication.  Otherwise the
   proxy switch looks up its ARP/ND cache to find the IP address
   corresponding to the inner destination MAC address and places the
   result in the destination IPv4/IPv6 address.

   When an incoming frame from the non-VXLAN interface is received, the
   proxy switch checks if the destination is within the host (another VM

   in the same VLAN).  In that case the frame is forwarded back down the
   port it was received on.

7.  Virtual Machine Creation

   Virtual machines are created by the management center.  The
   management center creates a virtual machine, assigns a server to it.
   Usually each server may host more than one virtual machine.

   When a virtual machine is created, the management center assigns a
   MAC address and its VXLAN Network Identifier.  The center sends MAC
   address and VNI to the server.

8.  VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint Notification

   At the time when the virtual machine is created, the management
   center also notifies the ToR switch hosting a VTEP that is
   responsible for the server in which the VM was created.  ToR switch
   receives MAC address and VNI value for this virtual machine.

   ToR switch is responsible for keeping all MAC address/VNI values for
   each virtual machine that it serves.  These values are used in
   encapsulating the packets coming from the virtual machines and in
   virtual machine operation.

9.  Virtual Machine Mobility and Operation

   In Proxy VXLAN, virtual machine mobility can be achieved using the
   following steps:

   Step 1.  Source VTEP is notified with destination VTEP of the moving
   VM,

   Step 2 Source VTEP tunnels all packets for the VM to destination VTEP

   Step 3 When the VM is ready, it would send gratuitous ARP to all VMs

   Step 4 When the source VTEP receives the gratuitous ARP, it removes
   the VM MAC from its original forwarding table and stops tunneling for
   this virtual machine .

   When a VM is created or after VM is moved, VM starts its operation,
   e.g. by sending ARP/ND packets.  Non-VXLAN server sends the packet to
   the upstream switch which finally reaches the ToR switch hosting the
   VTEP[architecture].  VTEP normally converts this packet, i.e.
   broadcast packet into a multicast packet, encapsulates it and sends
   it out to VXLAN enabled servers.  How ARP/ND packets are processed is
   out of scope.
