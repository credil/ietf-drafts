    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This is a direction to IANA concerning the delegation of certain
	additional IPv4 zones to the AS112 Project <xref 
	target="RFC6304"></xref> which 
	operates in an <xref target="RFC4786">anycast cloud</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Reverse DNS Delegation, Local-Use and Test Addresses">
      <t>Work documenting <xref
        target="RFC5735">special use addresses</xref> have appeared containing
        good
	candidates for inclusion with the existing delegations to the AS112
	Project.  These local and special use addresses have now been
	captured and identified for Domain Name System (DNS <xref
	target="RFC1034"></xref> and <xref target="RFC1035"></xref>)
	zone administrators to curtail leaking
	queries in <xref target="RFC6303"></xref>.
      </t>

      <t>Additionally, <xref target="RFC5737"></xref> identifies a short
	listing of IPv4 address blocks for use in documentation.  These
	too should be considered for delegation to the AS112 Project.</t>

      <t>Thus the purpose of this memo is to effectively signal to the 
	AS112 Project <xref target="RFC6304"></xref> 
	that it should reflect the efforts of <xref 
	target="RFC6303"></xref> and follow
	directives and delegations subsequently issued as described in
	section 6.</t>

      <t>It is interesting to note that while the focus has largely been on
        the use of <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> addresses, some
        addresses (such as those first enumerated within <xref
        target="RFC1912"></xref>) have as of late also been the subject
	of <xref target="RFC6303"></xref>
	.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>As per the provisions of <xref target="RFC3596"></xref>, this
	document recommends the IAB to direct IANA to delegate the following
	IN-ADDR.ARPA reverse DNS zones to the AS112 project <xref
	target="RFC6304"></xref>:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
              0.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 "This" Network)
            127.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Loop-Back Network)
        2.0.192.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Test Net 1)
     100.51.198.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Test Net 2)
      113.0.203.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Test Net 3)
255.255.255.255.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Broadcast)
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>AS112 project servers should add these zones to their configuration,
      and terminate queries efficiently inside their service
      infrastructure.</t>

      <t>This delegation instruction is subject to further direction in the
      future from the IAB to IANA, as per the provisions of <xref
      target="RFC3596"></xref>.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The Security Considerations described in <xref
      target="RFC6304"></xref> also apply to local-use IPv4
      addresses, and should be considered in the context of the use of these
      addresses.</t>

      <t>Security administrators as well as general support personnel who
      are involved in the operations of networked devices may also find
      the information found in the companion document <xref
      target="RFC6305"></xref> quite
      helpful.</t>

      <t>DNS queries may well identify the location of deployment of IPv4
      enabled equipment in private contexts, particularly when the reverse
      queries relate to local-use IPv4 addresses. While operators of the DNS
      reverse servers should respect the privacy of data relating to
      individual queries made to these reverse address servers, the
      unintentional leakage of information beyond its intended scope of use
      and circulation represents a potential threat to the security of a local
      private network. This direction to delegate these local-use IPv4 reverse
      address sub-domains does not substantially change the security risks of
      information leakage from private environments.</t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
     <t>The author would like to acknowledge the efforts of Mark P. Andrews for
     preparing the work related to serving certain DNS zones locally and George
     Michaelson and Geoff Huston for their <xref
     target="I-D.michaelson-as112-ipv6">work</xref> in setting the example
     for a template to be used by the AS112 Project as a direction for the
     IANA.</t>

     <t>The author would also like to thank Joe Abley, Marco d'Itri, 
        Nick Hilliard and Paul Vixie for their feedback.</t>
