               DHCP Options for 3GPP Specific Information
                    draft-liu-dhc-3gpp-option-00.txt

Abstract

   This document defines a new option that can be used by DHCP clients
   to send to DHCP servers.  This new option includes some sub-options.
   It also defines standard parameter format and code so that there will
   be no ambiguity in interoperating the information being exchanged.
   It may be used for scenarios interworking with non-3GPP and 3GPP
   network.

Internet-Draft   DHCP Opt for 3GPP Specific Information   September 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) defined in [RFC2131]
   provides configuration parameters to hosts on a TCP/IP based network.
   DHCP is built on a client-server model, where designated DHCP server
   allocate network addresses and deliver configuration parameters to
   dynamically configured hosts.  The changes to [RFC2131] defined in
   this document defines the use of 3GPP specific option transferred to
   DHCP server by DHCP client.

3.  Problem Statement

   In 3GPP TS 23.402, 3GPP EPS supports the use of non-3GPP IP access
   networks to access the EPC.

   When non-3GPP access is trusted, and non-3GPP access network supports
   Network Based Mobility protocol, UE shall send L3 attach trigger
   message for triggering trusted non-3GPP access to interwork with the
   EPC.  And trusted non-3GPP access will return UE IP address by the L3
   attach complete message.  The figure 1 is shown as follows.

         Figure 1: Initial attachment over Trusted Non-3GPP Access

   For L3 attach trigger message, DHCP protocol is considered of
   preferred one.  And then, UE acts as DHCP client, trusted non-3GPP
   access acts as DHCP server.  However, during initial attachment to a
   trusted non-3GPP access, trusted non-3GPP access needs to get UE
   requested APN, requested PDN type.  All the parameters are very
   important for trusted non-3GPP access to interwork with the EPC.

Internet-Draft   DHCP Opt for 3GPP Specific Information   September 2011


   Currently, both the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315] and DHCPv4
   specification [RFC2131] don!_t define above 3GPP specific options.

   This document is intended to define a new DHCP options for 3GPP
   specific information.

4.  3GPP Specific Information Option Format

   In order to supply options for the DHCP client to send to the server,
   the client sends a 3GPP specific Options option in the DHCP message
   to DHCP server, this option encapsulates whatever suboptions the
   client wishes to provide to the DHCP server.

   The purpose of APN is to identify the packet data network to which
   the user wishes to connect and to notify the access point of the
   packet data network that wishes to connect to the MS.  The suboption
   format is referred to 3GPP TS 24.008 description.

5.  DHCP Client Behavior

   For DHCPv4 protocol, DHCP client may include a 3GPP specific option
   in the option payload of DHCPDISCOVER message being sent toward a
   DHCP server.

   For DHCPv6 protocol, DHCP client may include a 3GPP specific option
   in the option payload of SOLICIT message being sent toward a DHCP
   server.

   When initial attach, DHCP client may include a 3GPP specific option
   which include requested APN, requested PDN type.  And when handover
   from 3GPP to a trusted non-3GPP access, DHCP client may include a
   3GPP specific option which include requested APN.

6.  DHCP Server Behavior

   DHCP server gets 3GPP specific option from received DHCPDISCOVER or
   SOLICIT message, and transfers these information, such as requested
   APN, request PDN type to 3GPP EPC by PMIP or GTP message.
