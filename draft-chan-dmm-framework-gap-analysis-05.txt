          Framework for Mobility Management Protocol Analysis
                draft-chan-dmm-framework-gap-analysis-05

Abstract

   This document introduces a framework for analyzing mobility
   management protocols in terms of their key abstracted logical
   functions.  The framework is capable of presenting a unified view,
   reducing the clutter that obscures a casual reader from understanding
   the commonalities between different approaches in mobility
   management.  More importantly, a first order application of this
   framework allows us to examine previously standardized mobility
   management protocols, such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well as several of
   their extensions), and describe their core functionality in terms of
   different configurations of the logical functions defined by the
   framework.  As a result, we can use the framework to analyze the gaps
   between the protocols needed in a distributed mobility management
   environment and the functionality provided by the current generation
   of mobility management protocols.  Our analysis points to the need
   for a re-configuration of logical functions identified in the
   framework as well as the need for new extensions which can make
   distributed mobility management possible in the future.

1.  Introduction

   While there is ongoing research on new protocols for distributed
   mobility management (DMM), it has also been proposed, e.g., in
   [Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP] and in other publications, that a
   distributed mobility management architecture can be designed using
   primarily existing mobility management protocols with some
   extensions.  This is reflected in the requirement presented in [ID-
   dmm-requirements]: distributed mobility management is to first use
   existing protocols and their extensions before considering new
   protocol designs.

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275], which is a logically centralized mobility
   management approach addressing primarily hierarchical mobile
   networks, has numerous variants and extensions including, just to
   name a few, PMIPv6 [RFC5213], Hierarchical MIPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC5380],
   Fast MIPv6 (FMIPv6) [RFC4068] [RFC4988], Proxy-based FMIPv6 (PFMIPv6)
   [RFC5949].  These variants or extensions of MIPv6 have been developed
   over the years owing to the different needs that have been arising
   ever since the first specification of MIP came into life.

   This document argues that we can gain much more insights into this
   design space by abstracting functions of existing mobility management
   protocols in terms of logical functions.  Different variants of
   existing mobility management protocols can then be expressed as
   different design variations of how these logical functions are put
   together.  The result is a rich framework that can express
   sophisticated functionalities in a more straightforward manner and
   can be used to perform gap analysis of existing protocols.  What is
   more, this document shows how to reconfigure these logical functions
   towards various distributed mobility management designs.

   The following subsection presents an overview of this document.

1.1.  Overview

   Section 3 proposes to abstract existing mobility management protocol
   functions into three logical functions, namely, home address
   allocation, mobility routing and location management.  Such
   functional decomposition will enable us to clearly separate data
   plane and the control plane functionality, and gives us the
   flexibility in an implementation to position said logical functions
   at their most appropriate places in the system design.

   Section 4 shows that these logical functions can indeed perform the
   same functions as the major existing mobility protocols.  These
   functions therefore become the foundation for a unified framework
   upon which different designs of distributed mobility management may

   be built upon.

   Section 6 presents the gap analysis of existing protocols by
   comparing them against the DMM requirements as per [ID-dmm-
   requirements].

   Extensions to overcome the gaps are presented in Sections 5 and 7.
   Based on the introduced unified framework, extensions to dynamically
   provide mobility support are described in Section 7.1 where the home
   IP address of an MN is generalized to that of an application session.
   A distributed database architecture is described in Section 5.1.
   Using this distributed architecture, various route optimizations can
   be defined as explained in Section 7.2.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All general mobility-related terms and their acronyms used in this
   document are to be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 base
   specification [RFC6275] and in the Proxy mobile IPv6 specification
   [RFC5213].  These terms include mobile node (MN), correspondent node
   (CN), home agent (HA), local mobility anchor (LMA), and mobile access
   gateway (MAG).

   In addition, this document uses the following terms:

   Mobility routing (MR)  is the logical function that intercepts
      packets to/from the HoA of a mobile node and forwards them, based
      on internetwork location information, either directly towards
      their destination or to some other network element that knows how
      to forward the packets to their ultimate destination.

   Home address allocation  is the logical function that allocates the
      home network prefix or home address to a mobile node.

   Location management (LM)  is the logical function that manages and
      keeps track of the internetwork location information of a mobile
      node, which includes the mapping of the MN HoA to the MN routing
      address or another network element that knows where to forward
      packets destined for the MN.

   Home network of an application session (or an HoA IP address)  is the
      network that has allocated the IP address used as the session
      identifier (HoA) by the application being run in an MN.  The MN
      may be attached to more than one home networks.



3.  Mobility Management Logical Functions

   The existing mobility management functions of MIPv6, PMIPv6, and
   HMIPv6 ca be abstracted into the following logical functions:

   1.  Anchoring: allocation of home network prefix or HoA to an MN that
       registers with the network;

   2.  Mobility Routing (MR) function: packets interception and
       forwarding to/from the HoA of the MN, based on the internetwork
       location information, either to the destination or to some other
       network element that knows how to forward the packets to their
       destination;

   3.  Internetwork Location Management (LM) function: managing and
       keeping track of the internetwork location of an MN, which
       includes a mapping of the HoA to the mobility anchoring point
       that the MN is anchored to;

   4.  Location Update (LU): provisioning of MN location information to
       the LM function;

   5.  Routing Control (RC): this logical function configures the
       forwarding state of the mobility routing function.



4.  Functional Representation of Existing Mobility Protocols

   This section shows that existing mobility management protocols can be
   expressed as different configurations of the logical functions
   introduced in Section 3 above.

   Using these generic logical functions, we will build up the existing
   mobility protocols one step at a time in the following sequence:
   MIPv6, PMIPv6, HMIPv6, and HAHA.  Functions are added and modified as
   needed in each step.

4.1.  Mobile IPv6

   Figure 1 shows Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] in a functional representation.
   The combination of the logical functions MR, LM and HoA allocation in
   network1 is the home agent or the mobility anchor.  The mobile node
   MN11 was originally attached to Network1 and was allocated the IP
   prefix for its home address HoA11.  After some time, MN11 moved to
   Network3, from which it is allocated a new prefix to configure the IP
   address IP32.  LM1 maintains the binding HoA11:IP32 so that packets
   from CN21 in Network2 destined to HoA11 will be intercepted by MR1,
   which will then tunnel them to IP32.  MN11 must perform mobility
   signaling using the LU function.

4.2.  MIPv6 versus PMIPv6

   MIPv6 and PMIPv6 both employ the same concept of separating the
   session identifier from the routing address into the HoA and CoA,
   respectively.  Figure 2 contrasts (a) MIPv6 and (b) PMIPv6 by showing
   the destination IP address in the network-layer header as a packet
   traverses from a CN to an MN.

   Figure 2.  Network layer in the protocol stack of packets sent from
   the CN and tunneled (a) to the MN+LU in MIPv6; and (b) to the AR+LU
   in PMIPv6 showing the destination IP address as the packet traverses
   from the CN to the MN.

   Figure 2 shows that, as far as data-plane traffic is concerned,
   routing from CN to MN+LU in MIPv6 is similar to the route from CN to
   AR+LU in PMIPv6.  The difference is in that the MN with the LU
   function is substituted by the combination of the AR with the LU
   function and the MN.  While additional signaling is needed to enable
   the combination of AR+LU and MN to behave like MN+LU, such signaling
   can be confined between the AR+LU and MN only.  It can therefore be
   seen under this unified formulation, that a host-based mobility
   management protocol can be translated using this substitution into a
   network-based mobility management protocol and vice versa.

   MIPv6 and PMIPv6 bundle all three mobility management logical
   functions: LM1, IP1 prefix allocation, and MR1 into the home agent
   (HA) and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) respectively.

   The functional representation of Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is shown
   in Figure 3.  In PMIPv6, the combination of LM, MR, and HoA
   allocation is the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA), whereas the AR+LU
   combination together with additional signaling with MN comprises the
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).  Here MN11 is attached to the access
   router AR31 which has the IP address IP31 in Network3.  LM1 maintains
   the binding HoA11:IP31.  The access router AR31 also behaves like a
   home link to MN11 so that MN11 can use its original IP address HoA11.

   Figure 4.  Functional representation of Hierarchical Mobile IPv6.

   Besides the logical functions: LM1, MR1, and HoA1 prefix allocation
   in Network1 as MIPv6 in Figure 2 and PMIPv6 in Figure 3, there is an
   MR function (MR3) in the visited network (Network3).  MR3 is also a
   proxy between LM1 and MN11 in the hierarchical LM function LM1--MR3--
   MN11.  That is, LM1 maintains the LM binding HoA11:MR3 while MR3
   keeps the LM binding HoA11:IP32.  The combined function of MR and the
   LM proxy function is the Mobility Anchor Point (MAP).

   In Figure 4, if MN11 takes the place of MN31 which is attached to
   AR31, the resulting mobility management becomes network-based.

4.4.  Migrating Home Agents

   When all these logical functions are bundled into one single entity
   e.g., a home agent in MIPv6 or a local mobility anchor in PMIPv6, in

   the CN are in networks close to each other but are far from the
   anchor point.

   A method to solve the triangle routing problem is to duplicate the

   Figure 5.  Functional representation of Migrating Home Agents.

   Here, the MR function is available in each of the three networks
   Network1, Network2, and Network3.  The LM function in each network
   (LM0) contains the LM information for all networks.  Each MR in each
   network advertises the HoA IP prefixes of all these networks using
   anycast.  Traffic from CN21 in Network2 destined to HoA11 will
   therefore be intercepted by the MR nearest to CN, which is MR2.
   Using the LM information in LM0, MR2 will use the binding HoA11:IP32
   to tunnel the packets to MN11.

   Similarly, traffic originating from MN11 will be served by its
   nearest MR (MR3).  Triangular routing is therefore avoided.  Yet the
   synchronization of all home agents becomes a challenge as discussed
   in [Paper-SMGI].  In addition, the amount of signaling traffic needed
   in synchronizing the home agents may become excessive when both the
   number of mobile nodes and the number of home agents increase.

   As before, if MN11 in Figure 5 takes the place of MN31 which is
   attached to AR31, the resulting mobility management becomes network-

5.  DMM Functional Scenarios

   This section covers the functional description of DMM.  Basically,
   the scenario presents a way to distribute the logical mobility
   functions.  Gap analysis will be made on the functional scenarios.

5.1.  Flat Network Scenario

   In a flat network, the logical functions in the functional
   representation may all be located at the AR as shown in Figures 6 and
   7, respectively.  These two figures depict the network- and client-
   based distributed mobility management scenarios.  The AR is expected
   to support the HoA allocation function.  Then, depending on the
   mobility situation of the MN, the AR can run different functions:

   1.  the AR can act as a legacy IP router;

   2.  the AR can provide the MR function (i.e. act as mobility anchor);

   3.  the AR can provide the LU functions;

   4.  the AR can provide both MR and LU functions.


   For example, [I-D.seite-dmm-dma] and [I-D.bernardos-dmm-distributed-
   anchoring] are PMIPv6 based implementation of this scenario.

5.1.1.  Network-based Mobility Management

   The functional description of network-based mobility management is
   depicted on figure 6.

   In case (1), MN1 attaches to AR1.  AR advertises prefix HoA1 to MN1
   and then acts as a legacy IP router.  MN1 initiates a communication
   with CN11.

   In case (2), MN1 performs a handover from AR1 to AR3 while
   maintaining ongoing IP communication with CN11.  AR1 becomes the
   mobility anchor for the MN1-CN11 IP communication: AR1 runs MR and LM
   functions for MN1.  AR3 performs LU up to the LM in AR1: AR3
   indicates to AR1 the new location of the MN1.  AR3 allocates a new IP
   prefix (HoA3) for new IP communications.  HoA3 is supposed to be used
   for new IP communication, e.g., if MN1 initiates IP communication
   with CN21.  AR3 shall act as a legacy IP router for MN1-CN21
   communication.

   In case (3), MN1 performs a handover from AR1 to AR2 with ongoing IP
   communication with CN11 and CN21.  AR1 is the mobility anchor for the
   MN1-CN11 IP communication.  AR3 becomes the mobility anchor for the
   MN1-CN21 IP communication.  Both AR1 and AR3 run MR and LM functions
   for MN1, respectively, anchoring HoA1 and HoA3.  AR2 performs
   location updates up to the LMs in AR1 and AR3 for respectively
   relocate HoA1 and HoA3.

5.1.2.  Client-based Mobility Management

   The functional description of client-based mobility management is
   depicted in Figure 7.

   In case (1), MN1 attaches to AR1.  AR advertises the prefix HoA1 to
   MN1 then acts as a legacy IP router.  MN1 initiates a communication
   with CN11.

   In case (2), MN1 performs a handover from AR1 to AR3 with ongoing IP
   communication with CN11.  AR1 becomes the mobility anchor for the
   MN1-CN11 IP communication: AR1 runs MR and LM functions for MN1.  The
   MN performs LU directly up to the LM in AR1 or via AR3; in this case
   AR3 acts as a proxy locator (pLU) (e.g. as a FA in MIPv4).  AR3
   allocates a new IP prefix (HoA3) for new IP communications.  HoA3 is
   supposed to be used for new IP communications, e.g., if MN1 initiates
   IP communication with CN21.  AR3 shall act as a legacy IP router for
   MN1-CN21 communication.

5.2.  Fully distributed scenario with separation of control and data
      planes

   This scenario considers multiple MRs and a distributed LM database.

   The different use case scenarios of distributed mobility management

   are described in [I-D.yokota-dmm-scenario] as well as in [Paper-
   Distributed.Mobility.Review].  The architecture described in this
   document is mainly on separating the data plane from the control
   plane.

   Figure 8 shows an example DMM architecture with the same three
   networks as in Figure 5.  As is in Figure 5, each network in Figure 8
   has its own IP prefix allocation function.  In the data plane, the
   mobility routing function is distributed to multiple locations at the
   MRs so that routing can be optimized.  In the control plane, the MRs
   may exchange signaling with each other.  In addition to these
   features in Figure 5, the LM function in Figure 8 is a distributed
   database, with multiple servers, of the mapping of HoA to CoA.

   Figure 8.  A distributed architecture for mobility management.

   To perform mobility routing, the MRs need the location information
   which is maintained at the LMs.  The MRs are therefore the clients of
   the LM servers and may also send location updates to the LM as the
   MNs perform the handover.  The location information may either be
   pulled from the LM servers by the MR, or pushed to the MR by the LM
   servers.  In addition, the MR may also cache a limited amount of
   location information.

   This figure shows three MRs (MR1, MR2, and MR3) in three networks.
   MN11 has moved from the first network supported by MR1 and LM1 to the
   third network supported by MR3 and LM3.  It may use an HoA (HoA11)
   allocated to it when it was in the first network for those
   application sessions that had already started when MN11 was attached
   there and that require session continuity after the handover to the

   third network.  When MN11 was in the first network, no location
   management is needed so that LM1 will not keep an entry of HoA11.
   After MN11 has performed its handover to the third network, the
   database server LM1 maintains a mapping of HoA11 to MR3.  That is,
   LM1 points to the third network and it is the third network that will
   keep track of how to reach MN11.  Such a hierarchical mapping can
   prevent frequent update signaling to LM1 as MN11 performs intra-
   network handover within the third network.  In other words, the
   concept of hierarchical mobile IP [RFC5380] is applied here but only
   in location management and not in routing in the data plane.


6.  Gap analysis

6.1.  DMM Requirements

6.1.1.  Considering existing protocols first

   The fourth DMM requirement is on existing mobility protocols [ID-dmm-
   requirements:

   REQ4: A DMM solution SHOULD first consider reusing and extending
   IETF-standardized protocols before specifying new protocols.

   Abstracting the existing protocol functions into logical functions in
   this draft is a way to see how one can maximize the use of existing
   protocols.  It remains to be seen whether all DMM requirements can be
   met.  One needs to check the rest of the requirements to identify the
   gaps.

   In addition, individual DMM proposals available at the IETF DMM
   working group are mostly based on the existing IETF-standardized
   protocols.

6.1.2.  Compatibility

   The first part of the fifth DMM requirement is on compatibility:

   REQ5: (first part) The DMM solution MUST be able to co-exist with
   existing network deployments and end hosts.  For example, depending
   on the environment in which DMM is deployed, DMM solutions may need
   to be compatible with other deployed mobility protocols or may need
   to interoperate with a network or mobile hosts/routers that do not
   support DMM protocols.

   Different deployments using the same abstract functions can be
   compatible with each other if their functions use common message
   formats between these functions.  A design principle of the IPv6



Chan, et al.             Expires April 26, 2013                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft         DMM-framework-gap-analysis           October 2012


   message format accommodates the use of common message formats as it
   allows to define extension headers, e.g., use of mobility header and
   options.

6.1.3.  IPv6 deployment

   The third DMM requirement on IPv6 deployment is the following.

   REQ3: DMM solutions SHOULD target IPv6 as the primary deployment
   environment and SHOULD NOT be tailored specifically to support IPv4,
   in particular in situations where private IPv4 addresses and/or NATs
   are used.

   This is not an issue with MIPv6, PMIPv6 and their extensions.  Using
   the unified scheme here based on abstracting these existing protocol
   functions will meet the DMM requirements as these protocols are
   originally designed for IPv6.

6.1.4.  Security considerations

   The first part of the fourth requirement as well as the sixth DMM
   requirement [ID-dmm-requirements] are as follows:

   REQ5 (second part): Furthermore, a DMM solution SHOULD work across
   different networks, possibly operated as separate administrative
   domains, when allowed by the trust relationship between them.

   REQ6: DMM protocol solutions MUST consider security aspects,
   including confidentiality and integrity.  Examples of aspects to be
   considered are authentication and authorization mechanisms that allow
   a legitimate mobile host/router to use the mobility support provided
   by the DMM solution; signaling message protection in terms of
   authentication, encryption, etc.; data integrity and confidentiality;
   opt-in or opt-out data confidentiality to signaling messages
   depending on network environments or user requirements.

   It is preferred that these security requirements are considered as an
   integral part of the DMM design.

6.1.5.  Distributed deployment

   The first DMM requirement has 2 parts.  The first part is on
   distributed deployment whereas the second part is on avoiding longer
   routes.

   REQ1: (part 1)IP mobility, network access and routing solutions
   provided by DMM MUST enable distributed deployment for mobility
   management of IP sessions (part 2) so that traffic does not need to



Chan, et al.             Expires April 26, 2013                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft         DMM-framework-gap-analysis           October 2012


   traverse centrally deployed mobility anchors and thus can be routed
   in an optimal manner.

   With the first part, multiple MRs will become available in MIPv6 by
   simply having an HA for each home network.  This is illustrated in
   terms of the logical functions as in Figure 8.  Note that [Paper-
   Host.based.DMM] shows an example of a host-based DMM protocol based
   on MIPv6.

   With the second part, one can examine dynamic mobility and route
   optimization to be discussed later.

   Figure 9 shows, as an example, three networks.  Each network has its
   own IP prefix allocation function.  The mobility routing function is
   distributed to multiple locations at the MRs so that routing can be
   optimized.  Again, the resulting mobility management becomes network-
   based if MN takes the position of MN31.

6.1.6.  Transparency to Upper Layers when needed

   To see how to avoid traversing centralized deployed mobility anchors,
   let us look at the second requirement on non-optimal routes [ID-dmm-



Chan, et al.             Expires April 26, 2013                [Page 20]

   requirements].

   REQ2: DMM solutions MUST provide transparent mobility support above
   the IP layer when needed.  Such transparency is needed, for example,
   when, upon change of point of attachment to the Internet, an
   application flow cannot cope with a change in the IP address.
   Otherwise, support for maintaining a stable home IP address or prefix
   during handovers may be declined.

   In order to avoid traversing long routes after the MN has moved to a
   new network, the new network can simply be used as the home network
   for new sessions.  The sessions that had already started in the
   previous network would still need to use the original network in
   which the session had started as the home network.  There may then be
   different IP sessions using different IP prefixes/addresses in the
   same MN.

   The capability to use different IP addresses for different IP
   sessions are therefore needed.

   The association with the HoA of an MN is not sufficient to support
   the above use of IP for an application.  This gap can be overcome by
   generalizing the concept of the HoA of the MN to the HoA of an
   application running on the MN as will be discussed in Section 7.1
   below.

   Using the dynamic mobility management scheme has avoided routing back
   to the home network when the application does not have such a need.
   There are, however, application sessions that had originated from a
   prior network and that require mobility support.  Longer routes than
   the natural IP route can therefore emerge.  Route optimization
   schemes already exist, but one needs to deal with multiple HA's when
   using multiple HA's.

6.1.7.  Route optimization

   The second part of first requirement is on route optimization.

   REQ1: (part 1)IP mobility, network access and routing solutions
   provided by DMM MUST enable distributed deployment for mobility
   management of IP sessions (part 2) so that traffic does not need to
   traverse centrally deployed mobility anchors and thus can be routed
   in an optimal manner.

   One generalization in terms of the unified framework is that the LM
   functions can be considered as a distributed database as will be
   shown in the next section.  There, the MN and the LM have a client-
   server relationship, with optionally a proxy in between and the proxy



Chan, et al.             Expires April 26, 2013                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft         DMM-framework-gap-analysis           October 2012


   can be co-located with an MR.  A distributed database may have
   different servers to store different data.  The data in each server
   need not be pushed to all other servers but the database system only
   needs to know which data resides on which server.  In addition, each
   client (i.e., MN) needs to be able to query the database.

   Existing functions, such as BU and BA messages, can be considered as
   a method of database update function for the mobility context of the
   MN.  Completing the design of messages for the database update
   functions will enable the distributed database design for route
   optimization.

   In the unified scheme, complete with database and mobility routing
   functionalities, numerous route optimizations can be designed as
   described in Section 7.2.

6.2.  Mobility Protocols Gap Analysis

6.2.1.  Gap analysis with the unified framework

   The use of the unified framework meets the following requirements:

   REQ4: Considering existing protocols first

   REQ5: (first part) compatibility

   REQ3: IPv6 deployment

   The unified framework has separated the HA function into an MR and an
   LM function.  The following is needed in addition:

   REQ6: Security - Trust between MR and LM is needed when they are not
   co-located.

6.2.2.  Gap analysis with MIPv6

   MIPv6 using the unified framework follows the above gap analysis with
   the unified framework.  In addition, the following is needed.

   REQ6: Security consideration

   Trust between MN and MR is needed.

6.2.3.  Gap analysis with PMIPv6

   In terms of the unified framework, PMIPv6 differs from MIPv6 only in
   the sense that the combination of an AR and the MN in the network-
   based solution behaves like an MN in the host-based solution.  While



Chan, et al.             Expires April 26, 2013                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft         DMM-framework-gap-analysis           October 2012


   the gap analysis with MIPv6 applies here, the following change is
   needed: The trust between MN and MR in MIPv6 is therefore replaced by
   the trust between AR and MR, and trust between the AR and the MN is
   needed.

   REQ6: Security consideration

   Trust between AR and MR is needed.

   Trust between MN and MR is needed.

6.2.4.  Gap analysis with HMIPv6

   In terms of the unified framework, HMIPv6 differs from MIPv6 and
   PMIPv6 only in the addition that packets are routed in the hierarchy
   MR(home network) -- MR(visited network) -- MN in MIPv6 or AR in
   PMIPv6.  While the gap analysis with MIPv6 and PMIPv6 applies to
   HMIPv6, the following additional trust relationship is needed between
   the MR's of different networks.

   REQ6: Security consideration

   Trust between MRs in different networks is needed.

6.2.5.  Gap analysis with HAHA

   The scenario for Migrating Home Agent can be constructed by using
   multiple MIPV6 or HMIPv6 networks and modifying the LM in each
   network to propagate its data to all LM servers in all other
   networks.  Therefore the gap analysis with MIPv6 and HMIPv6 apply.

   With the implementation of the unified framework in each network, the
   MR function is then available in different networks.  The following
   requirement of distributed deployment is then met.

   REQ1: Distributed deployment

   The unified framework functions can be deployed in each of the
   multiple networks.

   In addition, trust between the LM servers is needed.

   REQ6: Security consideration

   Trust among the LM servers is needed.

Internet-Draft         DMM-framework-gap-analysis           October 2012


6.2.6.  Gap analysis with Dynamic mobility management

   In Section 6, the unified framework functions are built by modifying
   the HAHA scenario.  The LM servers in different networks are no
   longer copying to each other and anycast may not be used.  Therefore
   the gap analyses with HAHA except that of copying the LM servers
   apply to the dynamic mobility management.  In addition,

   REQ2: Transparency to upper layers when needed.

   The home network and HoA was previously associated with an MN.  By
   extending the concept to that of an application rather than an MN
   which has multiple applications, dynamic mobility management can be
   achieved.

6.2.7.  Gap Analysis with Multiple MRs and Distributed LM Database

   In Section 7, an architecture of distributed mobility management is
   constructed from the unified framework functions and can be seen as
   an extension of the multiple home network scenario with dynamic
   mobility management support.  Therefore the gap analyses for the
   dynamic mobility management also apply.  In addition, the following
   gap analysis applies.

   REQ1: (part 2) Distributed deployment

   The LMs may generalize into a distributed database.

   REQ6: Security considerations

   Trust between the LM in a different network and the MR is needed.

6.2.8.  Gap Analysis with Route Optimization Mechanisms

   In Section 8, different possibilities to optimize the route using the
   architecture in Section 7 is described.  Therefore the gap analyses
   for the DMM architecture in Section 7 apply.  In addition, the
   following gap analyses apply.

   REQ1: (part 2) Distributed deployment

   MR may cache the LM information when needed.

   MR function is needed in the CN's network.

   REQ6: Security considerations

   Trust between the MR and the LM is needed.

7.1.  DMM scenarios and Dynamic mobility management requirement

   The distributed architecture described in Section 5.1, which has an
   MR and an HoA allocation function in each network, enables dynamic
   mobility management.

   When new applications are started after the MN moves to a new
   network, the device can simply use a new IP address allocated by the
   new network.  Dynamic mobility management, i.e., invoking mobility
   management only when needed, has been proposed in [Paper-
   Distributed.Dynamic.Mobility] and [Paper-Host.based.DMM].

   The architecture with multiple mobility routing functions compared
   with a centralized approach is more appropriate for achieving dynamic
   mobility management.  In Figure 9 above, the LM function and the IP
   address allocation function may be co-located.  The device MN11,
   originally attached to the first network (Network1), may simply be
   using a dynamic IP address HoA11 which is leased from Network1 with a
   finite lifetime of, say, 24 hours.  As MN11 leaves the first network
   and attaches to the third network (Network3), it acquires a new IP
   address IP33 from Network3.  MN11 may or may not have ongoing
   sessions requiring session continuity.  If it does not have, there is
   no need for LM1 to keep a binding for the home address HoA11 of MN11.
   If it does, it may use the existing MIPv6 signaling mechanism so that
   the LM1 will maintain the binding HoA11:MR3.  MR3 in turn will
   maintain the binding HoA11:IP33.  Such a hierarchy of binding with
   MR3 acting as the proxy location maintenance function between LM1 and
   MN11 will also cause MR3 to act as a proxy MR function between MR1
   and MN11 so that packets destined to MR1 will be redirected to MR3.

   When all ongoing sessions requiring session continuity terminate, it
   is possible for MN11 to deregister from LM1.  Yet one may not assume
   the device will always perform the de-registration.  Alternatively
   the lease of the dynamic IP address HoA11 will expire upon which LM1
   will remove the binding.

   In the event that the ongoing session outlives the lease of HoA11,
   MN11 will need to renew the lease with the IP address allocation
   function in the first network.

   More details on dynamically providing mobility support are found in
   [ID.seite-dmm-dma], [ID.liu-dmm-dynamic-anchor-discussion],
   [ID.bernardos-dmm-pmip], [I-D.ma-dmm-armip], and [ID.sarikaya-dmm-
   dmipv6].

   [I-D.seite-dmm-dma] describes dynamic mobility management using
   PMIPv6.  In that document, MR, LM, and the HoA allocation functions
   are co-located at the access router in a flat network.



Chan, et al.             Expires April 26, 2013                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft         DMM-framework-gap-analysis           October 2012


   [Paper-Net.based.DMM], or equivalently the draft [I-D.seite-dmm-dma],
   also describes dynamic mobility management in which the MR and the
   HoA allocation functions are both co-located at the access router,
   whereas the LM information in each of these access routers are linked
   together under the hierarchy of a centralized LM server.

   [Paper-Host.based.DMM] described fully distributed dynamic mobility
   management using MIPv6.  An access mobility anchor (AMA) is
   introduced as a mobility anchor that provides the MR, LM, and HoA
   allocation functions.  As a host-based DMM protocol, an MN is allowed
   to signal its movement to a serving AMA co-located at an access
   router.  The serving AMA signals to other AMAs associated to the
   active sessions of the MN that enable session continuity for the
   sessions anchored to the other AMAs.  No centralized LM server is
   required.

   [ID.sarikaya-dmm-dmipv6] also described dynamic mobility management
   for a flat network, with separate data plane and control plane.  The
   needed authentication is also described.

   [ID.bernardos-dmm-pmip] co-locates the home prefix allocation
   function and the mobility routing function at the access router,
   which is then named Mobility Anchor and Access Router (MAAR) in that
   draft.  The LM function is centralized and is named Central Mobility
   Database (CMD).

   [I-D.ma-dmm-armip] again describes dynamic mobility management in
   which the MR and the HoA allocation function are both co-located at
   the access router.

   [ID.liu-dmm-dynamic-anchor-discussion] describes the gaps and
   extensions needed to accomplish dynamic mobility management.

7.2.  Route optimization of DMM scenarios

   The distributed architecture has already enabled dynamic mobility
   management, as is described in [I-D.seite-dmm-dma], even when the
   routes are not optimized.  Route optimization mechanism can be
   achieved in addition to dynamic mobility.

   With the above architecture, there are a number of ways to enable
   reachability of an MN by packets sent from a CN using the mobility
   routing function.

   The target to avoid unnecessarily long route is the direct route
   instead of a triangular route.  In general, when a packet is sent
   from a CN in one network to an MN in another network, the direct
   route consists of the following 3 routing segments (RS):



Chan, et al.             Expires April 26, 2013                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft         DMM-framework-gap-analysis           October 2012


   RS1.CN-MR(CN):  the route segment from the CN to the nearest MR;

   RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN):  the route segment from the MR serving (and
      therefore being closest to) the CN to the MR serving the MN; and

   RS3.MR(MN)-MN:  the route segment from the MR serving the MN to the
      MN.

   One may therefore examine the route optimization mechanism in terms
   of these 3 routing segments.  In the first segment RS1:CN-MR(CN), the
   alternatives are:

   RS1.CN-MR(CN).anycast:  Use anycast to route the packet to the
      nearest MR function.  Here, each MR includes all the HoAs in its
      route announcement as if each of them is the destination for the
      HoA.  Such route announcements will affect the routing table such
      that the packet destined to an HoA will be routed to the nearest
      MR.  The use of anycast to reach the nearest HA has been used in
      [Paper-Migrating.Home.Agents] but with a different distributed
      architecture of duplicating many HAs.  It is again proposed in
      [Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP].

   RS1.CN-MR(CN).gw/ar:  Co-locate the MR function at a convenient
      location to which the packet will always pass.  Such locations may
      be the gateway router or the access router.  This approach will be
      described later.
      It is noted here that in a PMIPv6 design with a hierarchical
      network, the MAG generally is at the access router but LMA can be
      in the gateway router of a network.  Whether a distributed
      mobility design enhances the MAG or the LMA may involve quite
      different mechanisms.  Yet when looking at the logical function,
      it is basically the same MR function whether this function co-
      locates with the access router or the gateway router.  This draft
      therefore put both approaches together.  There is however a
      difference that the access router needs to perform proxy function
      when using PMIPv6.  Yet the logical MR functions are the same.
      It is again noted that in flattened network, the access router and
      the gateway router may merge together.  With they are merged, the
      needed function is again the same logical MR function.

   In the second segment RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN), the alternatives are:

   RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).query:  The MR query the LM database and use the
      result to tunnel the packet to the MR serving the MN.  In order
      words, the MR pulls the needed internetwork location information
      from the LM server.  There will be a delay owing to the time taken
      to send this query and to receive the reply.  Optionally, before
      receiving the reply, the first packet or the first few packets may



Chan, et al.             Expires April 26, 2013                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft         DMM-framework-gap-analysis           October 2012


      be forwarded using mip or pmip.  Then the first packet may incur a
      triangle route rather than to wait for the query reply.  After
      receiving the reply, the packet will be tunneled to the MR(MN).
      The result may be cached for forwarding subsequent packets.

   RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).push:  The MR routes the first packet to the home
      network using the existing MIPv6 or PMIPv6 mechanism.  It will
      then be intercepted by the MR of the MN which, with the help of
      LM, knows whether the MN has moved to a different network and use
      the mapping in LM to tunnel the packet to the MR of the MN.  Then
      the MR of the MN will inform MR of the CN to tunnel the packet
      directly to the MR of the MN in future.  In order words, after
      MR(CN) has forwarded the first packet to MR(MN), the MR(MN) is
      triggered to push the location information to MR(CN).  The MR of
      the CN may keep this information in its cache memory for
      forwarding subsequent packets.

   In the final segment RS3.MR(MN)-MN, the MR may keep track of the
   location of MN and route to it using its intra-network mobility
   management mechanism.

   Different designs using the above architecture can be made by taking
   different combinations of the different designs in the different
   route segments.  For example, the overall design of DMM may be:

   1.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).anycast followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).query:

   2.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).anycast followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).push:

       An example is [Paper-Distributed.Mobility.PMIP] which is
       explained for network-based mobile IP but is also applicable to
       host-based mobile IP.

   3.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).gw/ar followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).query:

       An example is in [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach] or
       [I-D.liu-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach] in which the MR function is
       co-located at the MAG which is usually at the access router.
       Here, when CN is also an MN using PMIPv6, the packet sent from it
       naturally goes to the access router which takes the logical
       function of MR so that it will query the LM, which resides in the
       LMA.  It then uses the query result to tunnel the packet to the
       MR(MN), which resides in the AR/MAG of the destination MN.  The
       signaling flow and other details are described in the referenced
       draft.

       Another example is in [I-D.jikim-dmm-pmip].  In the signal driven
       approach, the MR is co-located the access router, which is



Chan, et al.             Expires April 26, 2013                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft         DMM-framework-gap-analysis           October 2012


       considered as an extension of MAG.  The MR, i.e., the extended
       MAG, serving the CN queries the LM and cache the result so that
       it can tunnel packets to the MR serving the destination MN.

       [I-D.liebsch-mext-dmm-nat-phl] also co-locates the MR at the
       gateways.  The gateway which serves the network of transmitting
       node and where the MR is co-located is called the Ingress router,
       whereas that at the network of the MN at the receiving side is
       called egress router.  Instead of tunneling between these 2
       gateways, header rewrite using NAT is used to forward the packet
       through the internetwork route segment.

   4.  RS1.CN-MR(CN).gw/ar followed by RS2.MR(CN)-MR(MN).push:

       Another example is described in [Paper-
       Distributed.Mobility.Management].
