              Definitions of Textual Conventions (TCs) for
          Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Management
                        draft-ietf-bfd-tc-mib-04

Abstract

   This draft defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
   contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection (BFD) management information.  The intent is
   that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in BFD
   related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
   representations.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

Status of This Memo

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module which contains Textual Conventions
   for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocols.  These
   Textual Conventions should be imported by MIB modules which manage
   BFD protocols.

   Note that names of Textual Conventions defined in this document are
   prefixed with "IANA" to make it obvious to readers that they are IANA
   maintained.

   For an introduction to the concepts of BFD, see [RFC5880], [RFC5881]
   and [RFC5883].

    IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT                  "1x "
    STATUS                        current
    DESCRIPTION
        "BFD authentication key type.

         An IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC is always interpreted
         within the context of an IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC
         value.  Every usage of the IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC
         textual convention is required to specify the
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object that provides the
         context.  It is suggested that the
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object be logically registered
         before the object(s) that use the
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC textual convention, if they
         appear in the same logical row.

         The value of a IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC must
         always be consistent with the value of the associated
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC object.  Attempts to set a
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object to a value inconsistent
         with the associated IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC must fail
         with an inconsistentValue error.

         The following size constraints for a
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object are defined for the
         associated IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC values show below:

         noAuthentication(-1): SIZE(0)
         reserved(0): SIZE(0)
         simplePassword(1): SIZE(1..16)
         keyedMD5(2): SIZE(16)
         meticulousKeyedMD5(3): SIZE(16)
         keyedSHA1(4): SIZE(20)
         meticulousKeyedSHA1(5): SIZE(20)

         When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
         the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to limit
         the number of potential instance sub-identifiers; otherwise
         the applicable constraints MUST be stated in the appropriate
         conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or in the surrounding
         documentation if there is no single DESCRIPTION clause that
         is appropriate."

4.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other BFD
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document provides the base definition of the IANA-BFD-TC-STD-MIB
   module.  This MIB module is under the direct control of IANA.  Please
   see the most updated version of this MIB at <http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/bfdtc-mib>.  [RFC-Editor's Note (to be removed prior to
   publication): the IANA is requested to create page pointed to by
   URL.]

   This MIB makes reference to the following documents: [RFC2578],
   [RFC2579], [RFC5880], [RFC5881] and [RFC5883].

   IANA assigned an OID to the IANA-BFD-TC-STD-MIB module specified in
   this document as { mib-2 XXX }. [RFC-Editor's Note (to be removed
   prior to publication): the IANA is requested to assign a value for
   "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to record the assignment in the
   SMI Numbers registry.  When the assignment has been made, the RFC
   Editor is asked to replace "XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with
   the assigned value and to remove this note.]
