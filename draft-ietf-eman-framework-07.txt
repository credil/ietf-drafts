     Abstract 

        This document defines a framework for providing Energy 
        Management for devices and device components within or 
        connected to communication networks.  The framework defines an 
        Energy Management Domain as a set of Energy Objects, for which 
        each Energy Object is identified, classified and given 
        context.   Energy Objects can be monitored and/or controlled 
        with respect to Power, Power State, Energy, Demand, Power 
        Attributes, and Battery.  Additionally the framework models 
        relationships and capabilities between Energy Objects.

     1. Introduction 

        Network management is often divided into the five main areas 
        defined in the ISO Telecommunications Management Network 
        model: Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and 
        Security Management (FCAPS) [X.700].  Not covered by this 
        management model is Energy Management, which is now becoming a 
        critical area of concern worldwide as seen in [ISO50001].  
         
        This document defines a framework for providing Energy 
        Management for devices within or connected to communication 
        networks.  The framework describes how to identify, classify 
        and provide context for such devices. 
      
        The devices, or components of these devices, can then be 
        monitored and controlled.  Monitoring includes power, energy, 
        demand, and attributes of power.  Control for energy can be 
        achieved by setting devices or components power state. If a 
        device contains batteries, these can be also be monitored and 
        controlled. 
         
        The most basic example of Energy Management is a single device 
        reporting information about itself.  However, in many cases, 
        energy is not measured by the device itself, but by a meter 
        located upstream in the power distribution tree.  An example 
        is a power distribution unit (PDU) that measures energy 
        supplied to attached devices and reports this to an energy 
        management system.  Therefore, devices and their components 
        are recognized as having relationships to other devices or 
        components in the network from the point of view of energy 
        management.  There are further relationships between devices 
        and components, respectively, including aggregation 
        relationship, metering relationship, power source 
        relationship, and proxy relationship.  
      
                             
        Energy Management Documents Overview 

        The EMAN standard provides a set of specifications for Energy 
        Management.  This document specifies the framework, per the 
        Energy Management requirements specified in [EMAN-REQ]. 
         
        The applicability statement document [EMAN-AS] provides a list 
        of use cases, a cross-reference between existing standards and 
        the EMAN standard, and shows how this framework relates to 
        other frameworks.

        The Energy Object Context MIB [EMAN-OBJECT-MIB] specifies 
        objects for addressing Energy Object Identification, 
        classification, context information, and relationships from 
        the point of view of Energy Management. 
                           
        The Power and Energy Monitoring MIB [EMAN-MON-MIB] contains  
        objects for monitoring of Power, Energy, Demand, Power 
        Attributes and Power States. 
         
        Further, the battery monitoring MIB [EMAN-BATTERY-MIB] defines 
        managed objects that provide information on the status of 
        batteries in managed devices. 
      
         
     2.    Terminology 

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
        in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
         
       Some terms have a NOTE that is not part of the 
       definition itself, but is present to take into 
       account differences between terminologies of 
       different standards organizations or to add a 
       comment to help clarify the definition.

       Energy Management 

          Energy Management is a set of functions for 
          measuring, modeling, planning, and optimizing 
          networks to ensure that the network elements and 
          attached devices use energy efficiently and is

          appropriate for the nature of the application and 
          the cost constraints of the organization.  
          Reference: Adapted from [ITU-T-M-3400] 
          NOTES:  
          1. Energy management refers to the activities, 
            methods, procedures and tools that pertain to 
            measuring, modeling, planning, controlling and 
            optimizing the use of energy in networked 
            systems [NMF]. 
          2. Energy Management is a management domain which 
            is congruent to any of FCAPS areas of 
            management in the ISO/OSI Network Management 
            Model [TMN]. Energy Management for 
            communication networks and attached devices is 
            a subset or part of an organization's greater 
            Energy Management Policies. 
           
       Energy Management System (EnMS) 

          An Energy Management System is a combination of 
          hardware and software used to administer a 
          network with the primary purpose being Energy 
          Management. 
          Reference: Adapted from [1037C] 
          NOTES: 
          1. An Energy Management System according to 
            [ISO50001] (ISO-EnMS) is a set of systems or 
            procedures upon which organizations can develop 
            and implement an energy policy, set targets, 
            action plans and take into account legal 
            requirements related to energy use.  An ISO-
            EnMS allows organizations to improve energy 
            performance and demonstrate conformity to 
            requirements, standards, and/or legal 
            requirements.   
          2. Example ISO-EnMS:  Company A defines a set of 
            policies and procedures indicating there should 
            exist multiple computerized systems that will 
            poll energy from their meters and pricing / 
            source data from their local utility. Company A 
            specifies that their CFO should collect 
            information and summarize it quarterly to be 
            sent to an accounting firm to produce carbon

            accounting reporting as required by their local 
            government.  
          3. For the purposes of EMAN, the definition from 
            [1037C] is the preferred meaning of an Energy 
            Management System (EnMS).  The definition from 
            [ISO50001] can be referred to as ISO Energy 
            Management System (ISO-EnMS). 
           
       Energy  
          That which does work or is capable of doing work. 
          As used by electric utilities, it is generally a 
          reference to electrical energy and is measured in 
          kilo-watt hours (kWh). 
          Reference: [IEEE100] 
          NOTES 
          1. Energy is the capacity of a system to produce 
            external activity or perform work [ISO50001] 
           
       Power 

          The time rate at which energy is emitted, 
          transferred, or received; usually expressed in 
          watts (joules per second). 
          Reference: [IEEE100] 
           
       Demand  
          The average value of power or a related quantity 
          over a specified interval of time. Note: Demand 
          is expressed in kilowatts, kilovolt-amperes, 
          kilovars, or other suitable units. 
          Reference: [IEEE100]  
          NOTES: 
          1.  For EMAN we use kilowatts.  
      

        Power Attributes 

          Measurements of the electrical current, voltage, phase and 
          frequencies at a given point in an electrical power system.

        Power Quality  

          Characteristics of the electric current, voltage, phase and 
          frequencies at a given point in an electric power system, 
          evaluated against a set of reference technical parameters. 
          These parameters might, in some cases, relate to the 
          compatibility between electricity supplied in an electric 
          power system and the loads connected to that electric power 
          system.

          NOTES:  

          1. Electrical characteristics representing power quality 
          information are typically required by customer facility 
          energy management systems. It is not intended to satisfy the 
          detailed requirements of power quality monitoring. Standards 
          typically also give ranges of allowed values; the

     3.    Issues Specific to Energy Management 

         

        With Energy Management, there exists a wide variety of devices 
        that may be contained in the same deployments as a 
        communication network but comprise a separate facility, home, 
        or power distribution network.

     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        Target devices for Energy Management are all Energy Objects 
        that can directly or indirectly be monitored or controlled by 
        an Energy Management System (EnMS) using the Internet 
        protocol, for example:  
            - Simple electrical appliances / fixtures  
            - Hosts, such as a PC, a server, or a printer 
            - switches, routers, base stations, and other network 
        equipment and middleboxes 
            - A component within devices, such as a battery inside a 
        PC, a line card inside a switch, etc... 
            - Power over Ethernet (PoE) endpoints 
            - Power Distribution Units (PDU)  
            - Protocol gateway devices for Building Management Systems 
        (BMS) 
            - Electrical meters 
            - Sensor controllers with subtended sensors 
      
        There may also exist varying protocols deployed among these 
        power distributions and communication networks.  
         
        An Energy Management framework should also apply to these 
        types of separate networks as they connect and interact with a 
        communications network.  
         

        This section explains special issues of Energy Management 
        particularly concerning power supply, Power, and Energy 
        metering, and the reporting of Power States. 

        Energy Management has particular challenges in that a power 
        distribution network is used for the supply of energy to 
        various devices and components, while a separate communication 
        network is typically used to monitor and control the power 
        distribution network. 
         

        To illustrate the issues we start with a simple and basic 
        scenario where a single powered device receives Energy and 
        reports energy-related information about itself to an Energy 
        Management System (EnMS), see Figure 1

                  Figure 1: Basic energy management scenario 
         

        The powered device may have local energy control mechanisms, 
        for example putting itself into a sleep mode when appropriate, 
        and it may receive energy control commands for similar 
        purposes from the EnMS.  Information reported from a powered 
        device to the EnMS includes at least the Power State of the 
        powered device (on, sleep, off, etc.). 

        This and similar cases are well understood and likely to 
        become very common for Energy Management.  They can be handled 
        with well established and standardized management procedures.  
        The only missing components today are standardized information 
        and data models for reporting and configuration, such as, for 
        example, energy-specific MIB modules [RFC2578] and YANG 
        modules [RFC6020]. 

        However, the nature of energy supply and use introduces some 
        issues that are special to Energy Management.  The following 
        subsections address these issues and illustrate them by 
        extending the basic scenario in Figure 1. 

        WRT to Energy management there nothing new for faults, config, 
        performance or security management. We can re-use those 
        aspects of network management for an EnMS. But when there are 
        aspects specific to EM then this framework adds them. For 
        example with faults we can re-use rmon or snmp traps. For 
        security existing means like SNMPv3 security can be used. 

       3.1.  Power Supply 

        A powered device may supply itself with power.  Sensors, for 
        example, commonly have batteries or harvest Energy.  However, 
        most powered devices that are managed by an EnMS receive 
        external power. 
         
        While many devices receive Power from unmanaged supply 
        systems, the number of manageable power supply devices is 
        increasing. 
         
        In datacenters, for example, many Power Distribution Units 
        (PDUs) allow the EnMS to switch power individually for each 
        socket and also to measure the provided Power.  This is an

     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        action much different from many other network management 
        tasks: In such and similar cases, switching power supply for a 
        powered device or monitoring its power is not done by 
        communicating with the actual powered device itself, but with 
        an external device (in this case, the PDU 
         
        Consequently, a standard for Energy Management must not just 
        cover the powered devices that provide services for users, but 
        also the power supply devices (which are powered devices as 
        well) that monitor or control the power supply for other 
        powered devices. 
         
        A simple device such as a light bulb can be switched on or off 
        only by switching its power supply.  More complex devices may 
        have the ability to switch off themselves or to bring 
        themselves to states in which they consume very little power.  
        For these devices as well, it is desirable to monitor and 
        control their power supply. 
         
        This extends the basic scenario from Figure 1 by a power 
        supply device, see Figure 2.

        The power supply device can be as simple as a plain power 
        switch.  It may offer interfaces to the EnMS to monitor and to 
        control the status of its power outlets, as with PDUs and 
        Power over Ethernet (PoE) [IEEE-802.3at] switches. 
         
        The relationship between supply devices and the powered 
        devices they serve creates several problems for managing power 
        supply:

           o  Aggregation of monitoring and control for multiple

              *  A power supply device may supply multiple powered  
                 devices with a single power supply line. 
           o  Coordination of power control for devices with multiple  
              power inlets 
              *  A powered device may receive power via multiple power  
                 lines controlled by the same or different power  
                 supply devices. 
         

     Identification of Power Supply and Powered Devices 

        When a power supply device controls or monitors power supply 
        at one of its power outlets, the effect on other devices is 
        not always clear without knowledge about wiring of power 
        lines.  The same holds for monitoring.  The power supplying 
        device can report that a particular socket is powered, and it 
        may even be able to measure power and conclude that there is a 
        consumer drawing power at that socket, but it may not know 
        which powered device(s)receives the provided power. 
         
        In many cases it is obvious which other device is supplied by 
        a certain outlet, but this always requires additional 
        (reliable) information about power line wiring.  Without 
        knowing which device(s) are powered via a certain outlet, 
        monitoring data are of limited value and the consequences of 
        switching power on or off may be hard to predict. 
         
        Even in well organized operations, powered devices' power 
        cords can be plugged into the wrong socket, or wiring plans 
        changed without updating the EnMS accordingly. 
         
        For reliable monitoring and control of power supply devices, 
        additional information is needed to identify the device(s) 
        that receive power provided at a particular monitored and 
        controlled socket. 
         
        This problem also occurs in the opposite direction.  If power 
        supply control or monitoring for a certain device is needed, 
        then the supplying power supply device has to be identified. 
         
        To conduct Energy Management tasks for both power supply 
        devices and other powered devices, sufficiently unique 
        identities are needed, and knowledge of their power supply 
        relationship is required.

     Multiples Devices Supplied by a Single Power Line 

        The second fundamental problem is the aggregation of 
        monitoring and control that occurs when multiple powered 
        devices are supplied by a single power supply line.  It is 
        often required for the EnMS to discover the full list of

                             by Single Power Line 
         

        With this list, the single status value has clear meaning and 
        is the sum of all powered devices.  Control functions are 
        limited by the fact that supply for the concerned devices can 
        only be switched on or off for all of them at once.  
        Individual control at the supply is not possible. 
         
        If the full list of devices powered by a single supply line is 
        not known by the controlling power supply device, then control 
        of power supply is problematic, because the consequences of 
        control actions can only be partially known. 
         

     Multiple Power Supply for a Single Powered Device 

        The third problem arises from the fact that there are devices 
        with multiple power supplies.  Some have this for redundancy 
        of power supply, some for just making internal power 
        converters (for example, from AC mains power to DC internal

        power) redundant, and some because the capacity of a single 
        supply line is insufficient.

          Figure 4: Multiple Power Supply for Single Powered Device 
         
        The example in Figure 4 does not necessarily show a real world 
        scenario, but it shows the two cases to consider: 
           o  multiple power supply lines between a single power  
              supply  
              device and a powered device 
           o  different power supply devices supplying a single  
              powered device 
        In any such case there may be a need to identify the supplying 
        power supply device individually for each power inlet of a 
        powered device. 
         
        Without this information, monitoring and control of power 
        supply for the powered device may be limited. 
         
         
     Bidirectional Power Interfaces 

        Some power technologies (mostly low power DC) allow power to 
        be delivered bi-directionally.  In the example, energy stored 
        in batteries on one device can be delivered back to a power 
        hub which redirects the power to another device.  In this 
        situation, the interface can function as both an inlet and 
        outlet (at different times).   
         
        A Power Interface can model a power inlet or a power outlet, 
        depending on the conditions.  Information of interest Power 
        Interfaces include the power direction, as well as the energy 
        received, provided, and the net result.

     Relevance of Power Supply Issues 

        In some scenarios, the problems with power supply do not exist 
        or can be sufficiently solved.  With Power over Ethernet (PoE) 
        [IEEE-802.3at], there is always a one-to-one relationship 
        between a Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) and a Powered Device 
        (PD).  Also, the Ethernet link on the line used for powering 
        can be used to identify the PD and in many cases also the PSE. 
         
        For supply of AC mains power, the three problems described 
        above cannot be solved in general.  There is no commonly 
        available protocol or automatic mechanism for identifying 
        endpoints of a power line. 
         
        And, AC power lines support supplying multiple powered devices 
        with a single line and commonly do. 
         

     Remote Power Supply Control 

        There are three ways for an energy management system to change 
        the Power State of powered devices.  First is for the EnMS to 
        provide policy or other useful information (like the 
        electricity price) to the powered device for it to use in 
        determining its Power State.  The second is sending the 
        powered devices a command to switch to another Power State.  
        The third is to utilize an upstream device (to the powered 
        device) that has capabilities to switch on and off power at 
        its outlet. 
         
        Some devices do not have capabilities for receiving commands 
        or changing their Power States by themselves.  Such Energy 
        Objects may be controlled by switching on and off the power 
        supply for them and so have particular need for the third 
        method. 
         
        In Figure 4, the power supply can switch on and off power at 
        its power outlet and thereby switch on and off power supply 
        for the connected powered device. 
         

       3.2.  Power and Energy Measurement 

        Some devices include hardware to directly measure their Power 
        and Energy consumption.  However, most common networked 
        devices do not provide an interface that gives access to 
        Energy and Power measurements.  Hardware instrumentation for 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires August, 2013        [Page 20] 
         





     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        this kind of measurements is typically not in place and adding 
        it incurs an additional cost. 
         
        With the increasing cost of Energy and the growing importance 
        of Energy Monitoring, it is expected that in future more 
        devices will include instrumentation for power and energy 
        measurements, but this may take quite some time. 
         

     Local Estimates 

        One solution to this problem is for the powered device to 
        estimate its own Power and consumed Energy.  For many Energy 
        Management tasks, getting an estimate is much better than not 
        getting any information at all.  Estimates can be based on 
        actual measured activity level of a device or it can just 
        depend on the power state (on, sleep, off, etc.). 

        An advantage of estimates is that they can be realized locally 
        and with much lower cost than hardware instrumentation.  Local 
        estimates can be dealt with in traditional ways.  They don't 
        need an extension of the basic scenarios above.  However, the 
        powered device needs an energy model of itself to make 
        estimates. 

     Management System Estimates 

        Another approach to the lack of instrumentation is estimation 
        by the EnMS.  The EnMS can estimate Power based on basic 
        information on the powered device, such as the type of device, 
        or also its brand/model and functional characteristics. 
         
        Energy estimates can combine the typical power level by Power 
        State with reported data about the Power State. 
         
        If the EnMS has a detailed energy model of the device, it can 
        produce better estimates including the actual power state and 
        actual activity level of the device.  Such information can be 
        obtained by monitoring the device with conventional means of 
        performance monitoring. 
         
         
       3.3.  Reporting Sleep and Off States 

        Low power modes pose special challenges for energy reporting 
        because they may preclude a device from listening to and 
        responding to network requests.  Devices may still be able to 
        reliably track energy use in these modes, as power levels are 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires August, 2013        [Page 21] 
         





     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        usually static and internal clocks can track elapsed time in 
        these modes. 
         
        Some devices have out-of-band or proxy abilities to respond to 
        network requests in low-power modes.  Others could use proxy 
        abilities in an energy management protocol to improve this 
        reporting, particularly if the powered device sends out 
        notifications of power state changes. 
         
       3.4.  Device and Device Components 

        While the typical focus of energy management is entire powered 
        devices, sometimes it is desirable to manage individual 
        components of devices, such as line cards, fans, disks, etc.   
         
        This framework uses a much simpler model for components than 
        for entire devices.  The concept of Power Interfaces is not 
        used between a device and its contained components.  Reporting 
        of energy-related quantities for individual components is 
        limited to the most important ones.  Simplifications for 
        components in this framework include 
           o  identifying components like devices but without   
              distinct context information, 
           o  reporting a containment relationship to the containing  
              device, 
           o  inheriting all context information from the containing  
              device, 
           o  not modeling power interfaces and power lines between  
              the a component and its containing device or other  
              components, 
           o  only reporting real power and energy values for  
              components, 
           o  supporting power state monitoring and control for  
              components. 
         
        In rare cases where there is a need to model components of a 
        device in more detail, components of a device can be modeled 
        as an individual device.  Then all considerations for devices 
        also apply to these components.  The overhead of this model is 
        higher and it should be applied only when needed.  If used, it 
        is not necessarily visible whether or not a set of components 
        belongs to a single device, but for energy management purposes 
        this might not be of high relevance.

       3.5.  Non-Electrical Equipment 

        The primary focus of this framework is for the management of 
        Electrical Equipment.  Some Non-Electrical Equipment may be 
        connected to a communication networks and could have their 
        energy managed if normalized to the electrical units for power 
        and energy. 
         
        Some examples of Non-Electrical Equipment that may be 
        connected to a communication network are: 
        1) A controller for compressed air.  The controller is 
          electrical only for its network connection.  The controller 
          is fueled by natural gas and produces compressed air.  The 
          energy transferred via compressed air is distributed to 
          devices on a factory floor via a Power Interface: tools 
          (drills, screwdrivers, assembly line conveyor belts). The 
          energy measured is non-electrical (compressed air).   
           
            
        2) A controller for steam. The controller is electrical for its 
          network attachment but it burns tallow and produces steam to 
          subtended boilers. The energy is non-electrical (steam). 
           
        3) A controller or regulator for gas. The controller is 
          electrical for its network attachment but it has physical 
          non-electrical components for control. The energy is non-
          electrical (BTU). 
         
       4. Energy Management Abstraction 

        Energy Management can be organized into areas of concern that 
        include: 
         
        - Energy Object Identification and Context - for modeling and 
        planning  
        - Energy Monitoring - for energy measurements 
        - Energy Control - for optimization 
        - Energy Procurement - for optimization of resources 
         
        While an EnMS may be a central point for corporate reporting, 
        cost, environmental impact, and regulatory compliance, Energy 
        Management in this framework excludes Energy procurement and 
        the environmental impact of energy use.  As such the framework 
        does not include: 
        - Manufacturing costs of an Energy Object in currency or 
        environmental units 
        - Embedded carbon or environmental equivalences of an Energy 
        Object

     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        - Cost in currency or environmental impact to dismantle or 
        recycle an Energy Object 
        - Supply chain analysis of energy sources for Energy Object 
        deployment 
        - Conversion of the usage or production of energy to units 
        expressed from the source of that energy (such as the 
        greenhouse gas emissions associated with 1000kW from a diesel 
        source). 
         
        The next sections describe Energy Management organized into 
        the following areas: 
         
         - Energy Object and Energy Management Domain 
         - Energy Object Identification and Context  
         - Energy Object Relationships 
         - Energy Monitoring  
         - Energy Control   
         - Deployment Topologies 
         
       4.1.  Energy Object and Energy Management Domain 

        A meter is a type of device and any device can perform 
        metering. 

        In building management, a meter refers to the meter provided 
        by the utility used for billing and measuring power to an 
        entire building or unit within a building.  A sub-meter refers 
        to a customer or user installed meter that is not used by the 
        utility to bill but instead used to get readings from sub 
        portions of a building.  

        An Energy Management Domain can be any collection of devices 
        in a building but is recommended to map 1:1 with a metered or 
        sub-metered portion of the site.  An Energy Object is part of 
        a single Energy Management Domain.  The Energy Management 
        Domain MAY be configured on an Energy Object: the default 
        value is a zero-length string. 

        If all Energy Objects in the physical containment tree (see 
        ENTITY-MIB) are part of the same Energy Management Domain, 
        then it is safe to state that the Energy Object at the root of 
        that containment tree is in that Energy Management Domain. 

        An Energy Object Child may inherit the domain value from an 
        Energy Object Parent or the Energy Management Domain may be 
        configured directly in an Energy Object Child.

       4.2.  Power Interface 

        There are some similarities between Power Interfaces and 
        network interfaces.  A network interface can be used in 
        different modes, such as sending or receiving on an attached 
        line.  The Power Interface can be receiving or providing 
        power. 
         
        Most Power Interfaces never change their mode, but as the mode 
        is simply a recognition of the current direction of 
        electricity flow, there is no barrier to a mode change. 
         
        A power interface can have capabilities for metering power and 
        other electric quantities at the shared power transmission 
        medium. 
         
        This capability is modeled by an association to a power meter. 
         
        In analogy to MAC addresses of network interfaces, a globally 
        unique identifier is assigned to each Power Interface.   
         
        Physically, a Power Interface can be located at an AC power 
        socket, an AC power cord attached to a device, an 8P8C (RJ45) 
        PoE socket, etc. 
           
         

       4.3.  Energy Object Identification and Context  

     Energy Object Identification 

        A Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) [RFC4122] MUST be used to 
        uniquely and persistently identify an Energy Object. Ideally 
        the UUID should be used to distinguish the Energy Object among 
        all Energy Management Domains within the EnMS. 

        Every Energy Object SHOULD have a unique printable name within 
        the Energy Management Domain.  Possible naming conventions 
        are: textual DNS name, MAC-address of the device, interface 
        ifName, or a text string uniquely identifying the Energy 
        Object.  As an example, in the case of IP phones, the Energy 
        Object name can be the device's DNS name.

     Context in General 

        In order to aid in reporting and in differentiation between 
        Energy Objects, each Energy Object optionally contains 
        information establishing its business, site, or organizational 
        context within a deployment, i.e. the Energy Object Context. 

         

     Context: Importance 

        An Energy Object can provide an importance value in the range 
        of 1 to 100 to help rank a device's use or relative value to 
        the site.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) to 
        100 (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   

        For example: A typical office environment has several types of 
        phones, which can be rated according to their business impact.  
        A public desk phone has a lower importance (for example, 10) 
        than a business-critical emergency phone (for example, 100).  
        As another example: A company can consider that a PC and a 
        phone for a customer-service engineer is more important than a 
        PC and a phone for lobby use. 

        Although EnMS and administrators can establish their own 
        ranking, the following is a broad recommendation [CISC0-EW]: 

        . 90 to 100 Emergency response  
        . 80 to 90 Executive or business-critical  
        . 70 to 79 General or Average  
        . 60 to 69 Staff or support  
        . 40 to 59 Public or guest  
        . 1  to 39 Decorative or hospitality 
         

     Context: Keywords 

        An Energy Object can provide a set of keywords.  These 
        keywords are a list of tags that can be used for grouping, 
        summary reporting within or between Energy Management Domains, 
        and for searching.  All alphanumeric characters and symbols 
        (other than a comma), such as #, (, $, !, and &, are allowed.  
        Potential examples are: IT, lobby, HumanResources, Accounting, 
        StoreRoom, CustomerSpace, router, phone, floor2, or 
        SoftwareLab.  There is no default value for a keyword. 

        Multiple keywords can be assigned to a device.  White spaces 
        before and after the commas are excluded, as well as within a

        keyword itself. In such cases, the keywords are separated by 
        commas and no spaces between keywords are allowed.  For 
        example, "HR,Bldg1,Private". 

         

     Context: Role 

        An Energy Object can provide a "role description" string that 
        indicates the purpose the Energy Object serves in the EnMS.  
        This could be a string describing the context the device 
        fulfills in deployment. 

        Administrators can define any naming scheme for the role of a 
        device.  As guidance a two-word role that combines the service 
        the device provides along with type can be used [IPENERGY] 

        Example types of devices: Router, Switch, Light, Phone, 
        WorkStation, Server, Display, Kiosk, HVAC.

        Role as a two-word string: "Faculty Desktop", "Teller Phone", 
        "Shipping HVAC", "Advertising Display", "Helpdesk Kiosk", 
        "Administration Switch". 

         

       4.4.  Energy Object Relationships 

        Two Energy Objects MAY establish an Energy Object 
        Relationship. Within a relationship one Energy Object becomes 
        an Energy Object Parent while the other becomes an Energy 
        Object Child. 

        The Power Source Relationship gives a view of wiring topology.  
        For example: a data center server receiving power from two 
        specific Power Interfaces from two different PDUs.  


      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires August, 2013        [Page 27] 
         





     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        Note: A power source relationship may or may not change as the 
        direction of power changes between two Energy Objects. The 
        relationship may remain to indicate the change of power 
        direction was unintended or an error condition.  

        The Metering Relationship gives the view of the metering 
        topology.  Standalone meters can be placed anywhere in a power 
        distribution tree.  For example, utility meters monitor and 
        report accumulated power consumption of the entire building. 
        Logically, the metering topology overlaps with the wiring 
        topology, as meters are connected to the wiring topology.  A 
        typical example is meters that clamp onto the existing wiring. 

        The Proxy Relationship allows software objects to be inserted 
        into the wiring or metering topology to aid in management 
        (monitoring and/or control).  

        In many situations, the wiring, metering, and management 
        topologies overlap.  For example, a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) 
        device (such as an IP phone or an access point) is attached to 
        a switch port.  The switch port is the source of power for the 
        attached device, so the Energy Object Parent is the switch 
        port, which is a Power Interface, and the Energy Object Child 
        is the device attached to the switch.  This Energy Object 
        Parent (the switch) has three Energy Object Relations with 
        this Energy Object Child (the remote Energy Object): Power 
        Source Relationship, Metering Relationship, and Proxy 
        Relationship. 

        However, the three topologies (wiring, metering, and 
        management) don't always overlap.  For example, when a 
        protocol gateways device for Building Management Systems (BMS) 
        controls subtended devices, which themselves receive Power 
        from PDUs or wall sockets. 

        Note: The Aggregation Relationship is slightly different 
        compared to the other relationships (Power Source, Metering, 
        and Proxy Relationships) as this refers more to a management 
        function. 

        The communication between the parent and child for monitoring 
        or collection of power data is left to the device 
        manufacturer.  For example: A parent switch may use LLDP to 
        communicate with a connected child, and a parent lighting 
        controller may use BACNET to communicate with child lighting 
        devices.

        The Energy Object Child SHOULD keep track of its Energy Object 
        Parent(s) along with the Energy Object Relationships type(s).  
        The Energy Object Parent SHOULD keep track of its Energy 
        Object Child(ren), along with the Energy Object Relationships 
        type(s). 

         

     Energy Object Children Discovery 

        There are multiple ways that the Energy Object Parent can 
        discover its Energy Object Children: : 
         
          . In case of PoE, the Energy Object Parent automatically 
             discovers an Energy Object Child when the Child requests 
             power. 
          . The Energy Object Parent and Children may run the Link 
             Layer Discovery Protocol [LLDP], or any other discovery 
             protocol, such as Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP).  The 
             Energy Object Parent might even support the LLDP-MED MIB 
             [LLDP-MED-MIB], which returns extra information on the 
             Energy Object Children.  
          . The Energy Object Parent may reside on a network 
             connected to a facilities gateway.  A typical example is 
             a converged building gateway, monitoring several other 
             devices in the building, and serving as a proxy between 
             SNMP and a protocol such as BACNET. 
          . A different protocol between the Energy Object Parent and 
             the Energy Object Children.  Note that the communication 
             specifications between the Energy Object Parent and 
             Children is out of the scope of this document.   
          
        However, in some situations, it is not possible to discover 
        the Energy Object Relationships, and they must be set 
        manually.  For example, in today' network, an administrator 
        must assign the connected Energy Object to a specific PDU 
        Power Interface, with no means of discovery other than that 
        manual connection. 
              
         
        When an Energy Object Parent is a Proxy, the Energy Object 
        Parent SHOULD enumerate the capabilities it is providing for 
        the Energy Object Child.  The child would express that it 
        wants its parent to proxy capabilities such as, energy 
        reporting, power state configurations, non physical wake 
        capabilities (such as WoL)), or any combination of 
        capabilities.

     Energy Object Relationship Conventions and Guidelines 

         
        This Energy Management framework does not impose many "MUST" 
        rules related to Energy Object Relationships. There are always 
        corner cases that could be excluded with too strict 
        specifications of relationships. However, this Energy 
        Management framework proposes a series of guidelines, 
        indicated with "SHOULD" and "MAY". 
         
        Aggregation  
         
        Aggregation relationships are intended to identify when one 
        device is used to accumulate values from other devices. 
        Typically this is for energy or power values among devices and 
        not for Components or Power Interfaces on the same device.  
        The intent of Aggregation relationships is to indicate when 
        one device is providing aggregate values for a set of other 
        devices when it is not obvious form the power source or simple 
        containment within a device. 
         
        Establishing aggregation relationships within the same device 
        would make modeling more complex and the aggregated values can 
        be implied form the use of Power Inlets, outlet and Energy 
        Object value son the same device. 
         
        Additionally since an EnMS is naturally a point of aggregation 
        it is not necessary to model aggregation for an EnMS(s). 
         
        Aggregation SHOULD be used for power and energy. It MAY be 
        used for aggregation of other values from the information 
        model for example but the rules and logical ability to 
        aggregated each attribute is out of scope for this document. 
         
         
        - A Device SHOULD NOT establish an Aggregation Relationship 
          with a Component. 
        - A Device SHOULD NOT establish an Aggregation Relationship 
          with the Power Interfaces contained on the same device. 
        - A Device SHOULD NOT establish an Aggregation Relationship 
          with the an EnMS.  
        - Aggregators SHOULD log or provide notification in the case 
          of errors or missing values while performing aggregation. 
           
      
        Power Source 
         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires August, 2013        [Page 30] 
         





     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        Power Source relationships are intended to identify the 
        connections between Power Interfaces. This is analogous to a 
        Layer 2 connection in networking devices (a one hop 
        connection). 
         
        The preferred modeling would be for Power Interfaces to 
        participate in Power Source Relationships.  
         
        It may happen that the some Energy Objects may not have the 
        capability to model Power Interfaces.  Therefore, it may 
        happen that a Power Source Relationship is established between 
        two Energy Objects or two non-connected Power Interfaces. 
         
        While strictly speaking Components and Power Interfaces on the 
        same device do provide or receive energy from each other the 
        Power Source relationship is intended to show energy transfer 
        between Devices. Therefore relationship is implied on the same 
        Device. 
         
      
        - An Energy Object SHOULD NOT establish a Power Source 
          Relationship with a Component.  
        - A Power Source Relationship SHOULD be established with next 
          known Power Interface in the wiring topology.   
             o The next known Power Interface in the wiring topology 
               would be the next device implementing the framework. In 
               some cases the domain of devices under management may 
               include some devices that do not implement the 
               framework As such the Power Source relationship can be 
               established with the next device in the topology that 
               implements the framework and logically shows the Power 
               Source of the device. 
        - Transitive Power Source relationships SHOULD NOT be 
          established.  For examples if an Energy Object A has a Power 
          Source Relationship "Poweredby" with the Energy Object B, 
          and if the Energy Object B has a Power Source Relationship 
          "Poweredby" with the Energy Object C, then the Energy Object 
          A SHOULD NOT have a Power Source Relationship "PoweredBby" 
          the Energy Object C. 
         
        Metering Relationship 
         
        Metering Relationships are intended to show when one Device is 
        measuring the power or energy at a point in a power 
        distribution system. Since one point of a power distribution 
        system may cover many Devices with a complex wiring topology, 
        this relationship type can be seen as an arbitrary set.

     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        Additionally, Devices may include metering hardware for 
        components and Power Interfaces or for the entire Device.  
         
        For example some PDU's may have the ability to measure Power 
        for each Power Interface (metered by outlet). Others may only 
        be able to control power at each Power Interface but only 
        measure Power at the Power Inlet and a total for all Power 
        Interfaces (metered by device).       
         
        In such cases a Device SHOULD be modeled as an Energy Object 
        that meters all of its Power Outlets and each Power Outlet MAY 
        be metered by the Energy Object representing the Device. 
         
        - A Meter Relationship MAY be established with any other 
          Energy Object, Component, or Power Interface. 
        - Transitive Meter relationships MAY be used. 
        - When there is a series of meters for one Energy Object, the 
          Energy Object MAY establish a relationship with one or more 
          of the meters.   
         
        Proxy 
         
        A Proxy relationship is intended to show when one Device is 
        providing the Energy Object capabilities for another Device 
        typically for protocol translations. Strictly speaking a  a 
        Component of a Device may provide the Energy Object 
        capabilities for that Device (and vice versa) this 
        relationship is intended to model relationships between 
        Devices.  
         
        - A Proxy relationship SHOULD be limited when possible to 
          Energy Objects of different Devices.  
            
     Energy Objects Relationship Extensions  

        This framework for Energy Management, is based on four Energy 
        Objects Relationships: Aggregation Relationship, Metering 
        Relationship, Power Source Relationship, and Proxy 
        Relationship.   

        This framework is defined with possible extension of new 
        Energy Objects Relationships in mind.  For example, a Power 
        Distribution Unit (PDU) that allows physical entities like 
        outlets to be "ganged" together as a logical entity for 
        simplified management purposes, could be modeled with a future 
        extension based on "gang relationship", whose semantic would 
        specify the Energy Objects grouping.

       4.5.  Energy Monitoring 

        For the purposes of this framework energy will be limited to 
        electrical energy in watt hours.  Other forms of Energy 
        Objects that use or produce non-electrical energy may be part 
        of an Energy Management Domain (See Section 3.5)  but MUST 
        provide information converted to and expressed in watt hours. 

        An analogy for understanding power versus energy measurements 
        can be made to speed and distance in automobiles. Just as a 
        speedometer indicates the rate of change of distance, a power 
        meter indicates the rate of transfer of energy. The odometer 
        in an automobile measures the cumulative distance traveled and 
        an energy meter indicates the accumulate energy transferred. 
        So a less formal statement of the analogy is that power meters 
        measures "speed" while energy meters measure "distance". 

        Each Energy Object will have information that describes power 
        information, along with how that measurement was obtained or 
        derived (actual measurement, estimated, or presumed).  For 
        Energy Objects that can report actual power readings, an 
        optional energy measurement can be provided. 

        Optionally, an Energy Object can further describe the Power 
        information with Power Quality information reflecting the 
        electrical characteristics of the measurement. 

        Optionally, an Energy Object that can report actual power 
        readings can have energy meters that provide the energy used, 
        produced, and net energy in kWh. These values are energy 
        meters that accumulate the power readings.  If energy values 
        are returned then the three energy meters must be provided 
        along with a description of accuracy. 

        Optionally, an Energy Object can provide demand information 
        over time.  

         

     Power Measurement 

        A power measurement MUST be qualified with the units, 
        magnitude, direction of power flow, and SHOULD be qualified by 
        what means the measurement was made (ex: Root Mean Square 
        versus Nameplate). 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires August, 2013        [Page 33] 
         





     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        In addition, the Energy Object should describe how it intends 
        to measure power as one of consumer, producer or meter of 
        usage.  Given the intent, readings can be summarized or 
        analyzed by an EnMS.  For example metered usage reported by a 
        meter and consumption usage reported by a device connected to 
        that meter may naturally measure the same usage.  With the two 
        measurements identified by intent a proper summarization can 
        be made by an EnMS. 

        Power measurement magnitude should conform to the IEC 61850 
        definition of unit multiplier for the SI (System 
        International) units of measure.  Measured values are 
        represented in SI units obtained by BaseValue * (10 ^ Scale).  
        For example, if current power usage of an Energy Object is 3, 
        it could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, or 3 MW, depending on the value 
        of the scaling factor.  3W implies that the BaseValue is 3 and 
        Scale = 0, whereas 3mW implies BaseValue = 3 and ScaleFactor = 
        -3. 

        Electricity is usually billed in kilowatt-hours (not 
        megajoules, the SI units).  Similarly, battery charge is often 
        measured as miliamperes-hour (mAh) instead of the SI unit 
        coulomb.  The units used in this framework are: W, A, Wh, Ah, 
        V.   

        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude, it is useful 
        to know how an Energy Object usage measurement was obtained:  

        . Whether the measurements were made at the device itself or 
        from a remote source. 

        . Description of the method that was used to measure the 
        power and whether this method can distinguish actual or 
        estimated values.  

        An EnMS can use this information to account for the accuracy 
        and nature of the reading between different implementations. 

        The EnMS can use the Nameplate Power for provisioning, 
        capacity planning and potentially billing. 

         

     6.5.2 Optional Power Attributes 

        Given a power measurement, it may be desirable to know 
        additional power attributes associated with that measurement.

        The information model should adhere to the IEC 61850 7-2 
        standard for describing AC measurements. 

         

        Optional Demand  

        It is well known in commercial electrical utility rates that 
        demand is part of the calculation for billing.  The highest 
        peak demand measured over a time horizon, such as 1 month or 1 
        year, is often the basis for charges.  A single window of time 
        of high usage can penalize the consumer with higher energy 
        consumption charges.  However, it is relevant to measure the 
        demand only when there are actual power measurements from an 
        Energy Object, and not when the power measurement is assumed 
        or predicted.    

        Optional Battery  

        Some Energy Objects may use batteries for storing energy and 
        for receiving power supply.  These Energy Objects should 
        report their current power supply (battery, power line, etc.) 
        and the battery status for each contained battery.   Battery-
        specific information to be reported should include the number 
        of batteries contained in the device and per battery the state 
        information as defined in [EMAN-REQ]. 

        Beyond that a device containing a battery should be able to 
        generate alarms when the battery charge falls below a given 
        threshold and when the battery needs to be replaced.  

         

       4.6.  Control  

        An Energy Object can be controlled by setting it to a specific 
        Power State.  An Object implements a set of Power States 
        consisting of at least two states, an on state and an off 
        state. 

        A Power State is an interface by which an Energy Object can be 
        controlled.  Each Energy Object should indicate the set of 
        Power States that it implements.  Well known Power States / 
        Sets should be registered with IANA.

        When a device is set to a particular Power State, it may be 
        busy. The device will set the desired Power State and then 
        update the actual Power State when it changes.  There are then 
        two Power State control variables: actual and requested. 

        There are many existing standards for and implementations of 
        Power States.  An Energy Object can support a mixed set of 
        Power States defined in different standards. A basic example 
        is given by the three Power States defined in IEEE1621 
        [IEEE1621]: on, off, and sleep. The DMTF [DMTF], ACPI [ACPI], 
        and PWG define larger numbers of Power States. 

        The semantics of a power state is specified by 

           a) the functionality provided by an Energy Object in this 
        state, 

           b) a limitation of the power that an Energy Object uses in 
        this state, 

           c) a combination of a) and b) 

        The semantics of a Power State should be clearly defined. 
        Limitation (curtailment) of the power used by an Energy Object 
        in a state can be specified by 

           - an absolute power value 

           - a percentage value of power relative to the energy 
        object's nameplate power 

           - an indication of used power relative to another power 
        state - for example: by stating used power in state A is less 
        than in state B. 

        For supporting Power State management it is useful to provide 
        statistics on Power States including the time an Energy Object 
        spent in a certain Power State and/or the number of times an 
        Energy Object entered a power state. 

        Power States should be registered at IANA with a name and a 
        number.  

        When requesting an Energy object to enter a Power State an 
        indication of its name or its number can be used. Optionally 
        an absolute or percentage of Nameplate Power can be provided 
        to allow the Energy Object to transition to a nearest or 
        equivalent Power State.

     EMAN Power State Set 

        An EMAN Power State Set represents an attempt for a standard 
        approach to model the different levels of power of a device.  
        The EMAN Power States are an expansion of the basic Power 
        States as defined in [IEEE1621] that also incorporates the 
        Power States defined in [ACPI] and [DMTF].  Therefore, in 
        addition to the non-operational states as defined in [ACPI] 
        and [DMTF] standards, several intermediate operational states 
        have been defined.  

        There are twelve Power States, that expand on [IEEE1621]. The 
        expanded list of Power States are derived from [CISCO-EW] and 
        are divided into six operational states, and six non-
        operational states.  The lowest non-operational state is 1 and 
        the highest is 6.  Each non-operational state corresponds to 
        an [ACPI] Global and System states between G3 (hard-off) and 
        G1 (sleeping).  Each operational state represents a 
        performance state, and may be mapped to [ACPI] states P0 
        (maximum performance power) through P5 (minimum performance 
        and minimum power).  

        In each of the non-operational states (from mechoff(1) to 
        ready(6)), the Power State preceding it is expected to have a 
        lower Power value and a longer delay in returning to an 
        operational state:  

                 mechoff(1) : An off state where no Energy Object 
        features are available.  The Energy Object is unavailable.  No 
        energy is being consumed and the power connector can be 
        removed. This corresponds to ACPI state G3.                  

                 softoff(2) : Similar to mechoff(1), but some 
        components remain powered or receive trace power so that the 
        Energy Object can be awakened from its off state.  In 
        softoff(2), no context is saved and the device typically 
        requires a complete boot when awakened.  This corresponds to 
        ACPI state G2.          

                hibernate(3): No Energy Object features are 
        available.   The Energy Object may be awakened without 
        requiring a complete boot, but the time for availability is 
        longer than sleep(4). An example for state hibernate(3) is a 
        save to-disk state where DRAM context is not maintained.  
        Typically, energy consumption is zero or close to zero.  This 
        corresponds to state G1, S4 in ACPI.

                 sleep(4)    : No Energy Object features are 
        available, except for out-of-band management, such as wake-up 
        mechanisms.  The time for availability is longer than 
        standby(5). An example for state sleep(4) is a save-to-RAM 
        state, where DRAM context is maintained.  Typically, energy 
        consumption is close to zero.  This corresponds to state G1, 
        S3 in ACPI. 

                 standby(5) : No Energy Object features are available, 
        except for out-of-band management, such as wake-up mechanisms.  
        This mode is analogous to cold-standy.  The time for 
        availability is longer than ready(6).  For example, the 
        processor context is not maintained. Typically, energy 
        consumption is close to zero.  This corresponds to state G1, 
        S2 in ACPI. 

                 ready(6)    : No Energy Object features are 
        available, except for out-of-band management, such as wake-up 
        mechanisms. This mode is analogous to hot-standby.  The Energy 
        Object can be quickly transitioned into an operational state.  
        For example, processors are not executing, but processor 
        context is maintained.  This corresponds to state G1, S1 in 
        ACPI.         lowMinus(7) : Indicates some Energy Object 
        features may not be available and the Energy Object has 
        selected measures/options to provide less than low(8) usage.  
        This corresponds to ACPI State G0.  This includes operational 
        states lowMinus(7) to full(12). 

                 low(8)      : Indicates some features may not be 
        available and the Energy Object has taken measures or selected 
        options to provideless than mediumMinus(9) usage. 

                 mediumMinus(9): Indicates all Energy Object features 
        are available but the Energy Object has taken measures or 
        selected options to provide less than medium(10) usage. 

                 medium(10)  : Indicates all Energy Object features 
        are available but the Energy Object has taken measures or 
        selected options to provide less than highMinus(11) usage. 

                 highMinus(11): Indicates all Energy Object features 
        are available and power usage is less than high(12). 

                 high(12)    : Indicates all Energy Object features 
        are available and the Energy Object is consuming the highest 
        power.

     4.7. Energy Management Reference Model 

        The scope of this framework is to enable network and network-
        attached devices to be administered for Energy Management.  
        The framework recognizes that in complex deployments Energy 
        Objects may communicate over varying protocols.  For example 
        the communications network may use IP Protocols (SNMP) but 
        attached Energy Object Parent may communicate to Energy Object 
        Children over serial communication protocols like BACNET, 
        MODBUS etc.  The likelihood of getting these different 
        topologies to convert to a single protocol is not very high 
        considering the rate of upgrades of facilities and energy 
        related devices. Therefore the framework must address the 
        simple case of a uniform IP network and a more complex mixed 
        topology/deployment. 
         
        In this section we will describe the topologies that can exist 
        when describing a device, components and the relationships 
        among them. 
         
        We will then generalize those topologies by using an 
        information model based upon relationships. The most abstract 
        and general relationship between devices is a Parent and Child

        relationship. Specific types of relationships are defined and 
        used in concert to describe the topologies. 
         
     4.8 Using Device Relationships to Create Topologies 

        The reference models here define physical and logical 
        topologies of devices in a communication network. 

        The physical topology defined by the model defines 
        relationships between devices that reflect provisioning, 
        transfer of energy, and aid in management. 

        Logical topologies concern monitoring and controlling devices 
        and covers metering of energy and power, reporting information 
        relevant for energy management, and energy-related control of 
        devices. 

     Power Source Topology 

        As described in Section 4, the power source(s) of a device is 
        important for energy management.  The Energy Management 
        reference model addresses this by a "Power Source" 
        Relationship.  This is a relationship among devices providing 
        energy and devices receiving energy. 

        A simple example is a PoE PSE, for example, an Ethernet 
        switch, providing power to a PoE PD, for example, a desktop 
        phone.  Here the switch provides energy and the phone receives 
        energy.  This relationship can be seen in the figure below. 

              +----------+   power source  +---------+ 
              |  switch  | <-------------- |  phone  |

        A single power provider can act as power source of multiple 
        power receivers.  An example is a power distribution unit 
        (PDU) providing AC power for multiple switches.

        This level of modeling is sufficient if there is no need to 
        distinguish in monitoring and control between the individual 
        receivers at the switch. 

        However, if there is a need to monitor or control power supply 
        for individual receivers at the power provider, then a more 
        detailed level of modeling is needed. 

        Devices receive or provide energy at power interfaces 
        connecting them to a transmission medium.  The Power Source 
        relationship can be used also between power interfaces at the 
        power provider side as well as at the power receiver side.  
        The example below shows a power providing device with a power 
        interface (PI) per connected receiving device.

     Metering Topology 

        Case 1: Metering between two devices 

        The metering topology between two devices is closely related 
        to the power source topology.  It is based on the assumption 
        that in many cases the power provided and the power received 
        is the same for both peers of a power source relationship.  
        Then power measured at one end can be taken as the actual 
        power value at the other end.  Obviously, the same applies to 
        energy at both ends. 

        We define in this case a Metering Relationship between two 
        devices or power interfaces of devices that have a power 
        source relationship.  Power and energy values measured at one

        peer of the power source relationship are reported for the 
        other peer as well. 

        The Metering Relationship is independent of the direction of 
        the Power Source Relationship.  The more common case is that 
        values measured at the power provider are reported for the 
        power receiver, but also the reverse case is possible with 
        values measured at the power receiver being reported for the 
        power provider.

        Case 2: Metering at a point in power distribution 

        A Sub-meter in a power distribution system can logically 
        measure the power or energy for all devices downstream from 
        the meter in the power distribution system.  As such, a Power 
        metering relationship can be seen as a relationship between a 
        meter and all of the devices downstream from the meter. 

        We define in this case a Power Metering relationship between a 
        metering device and devices downstream from the meter. 

        In cases where the Power Source topology cannot be discovered 
        or derived from the information available in the Energy 
        Management Domain, the Metering Topology can be used to relate 
        the upstream meter to the downstream devices in the absence of 
        specific power source relationships.  

        A Metering Relationship can occur between devices that are not 
        directly connected as shown by the figure 13.

        An analogy to communication networks would be modeling 
        connections between servers (meters) and clients (devices) 
        when the complete Layer 2 topology between the servers and 
        clients is not known. 

     Proxy Topology 

        Some devices may provide energy management capabilities on 
        behalf of other devices.  For example, a controller may 
        logically model power interfaces but the physical topology may 
        require that the controller communicate to another device 
        using a building management protocol.  These proxied devices 
        that are represented as power interfaces may be directly 
        connected or may be controlled over a communication network 
        with no direct connection. 

        The proxied device may or may not be IP connected. When it is 
        IP connected the communication may be via SNMP or any other 
        protocol. 

        While the EnMS may look at the logical representation of the 
        controller as a device with power interfaces, it may require 
        to report the physical topology and relationship to the 
        subtended devices. To model this we define a proxy 
        relationship to provide this visibility.

     Aggregation Topology 

        Some devices can act as aggregation points for other devices.  
        For example, a PDU controller device may contain the summation 
        of power and energy readings for many PDU devices.  The PDU 
        controller will have aggregate values for power and energy for 
        a group of PDU devices.  

        This aggregation is independent of the physical power or 
        communication topology.  

        An Aggregation Relationship is an Energy Object Relationship 
        where one Energy Object (called the Aggregate Energy Object) 
        aggregates the Energy Management information of one or more 
        other Energy Objects.  These Energy Objects are referred to as 
        having an Aggregation Relationship.   
         
        The functions that the aggregation point may perform include 
        the calculation of values such as average, count, maximum, 
        median, minimum,  or the listing (collection) of the 
        aggregation values, etc.   

        Based on the experience gained on aggregations at the IETF 
        [draft-ietf-ipfix-a9n-08], the aggregation function in the 
        EMAN framework is limited to the summation. 

        While any power or energy values monitored from a device/power 
        interface can be seen as a summation for all devices 
        downstream from the monitoring device, the aggregation 
        relationship is used SHOULD BE instantiated to represent a

        summation when it is not obvious from the powering topology or 
        a device to component containment.  

        The Aggregation Relationship is then specified between the 
        Energy Object device containing aggregate values and each of 
        the other Energy Object devices for which the aggregation is 
        reported. If it does not exist, a new Aggregate Energy Object 
        specific for the Aggregation Relationship MUST be created.  

        EDITORs NOTE: add an outlet gang example and expand below.  

          A method to report on collections and summations of data is 
          to create special pseudo-devices.  These could be tagged 
          in the MIB as not being a real device, but this may not be 
          needed.  ThisA pseudo-device would have no power PIs Power 
          Interfaces, as to make clear that it does not interact with 
          the real power world.  It contains components which are 
          actually entities from real devices and can be any 
          combination of devices, PIs, and real components.  Most 
          commonly, a pseudo-device would contain a consistent set of 
          entities -
                   - a set of devices, a set of PIs, or a set of 
          components.  The power/energy values for the entire pseudo-
          device would be the sum of the components, as on a normal 
          device.  This provides an easy way to access the sum, as 
          well as full documentation of what the components of that 
          sum are.  This method is completely flexible and adds no 
          complexity to the EMAN framework or MIBs.  Implementation of 
          this mechanism would be completely optional for EMAN 
          devices; likely most would not. 

         

        When aggregation occurs across a set of entities, values to be 
        aggregated may be missing for some entities.  The EMAN 
        framework does not specify how these should be treated, as 
        different implementations may have good reason to take 
        different approaches.  One common treatment is to define the 
        aggregation as missing if any of the constituent elements are 
        missing (useful to be most precise). Another is to treat the 
        missing value as zero (useful to have continuous data 
        streams). 

        The specifications of this aggregation function are out of 
        scope of the EMAN framework, but must be clearly specified by 
        the equipment vendor.

     4.9 Generalized Relationship Model 

        As displayed in Figure 15, the most basic energy management 
        reference model is composed of an EnMS that obtains Energy 
        Management information from Energy Objects.  The Energy Object 
        (EO) returns information for Energy Management directly to the 
        EnMS.  
         
        The protocol of choice for Energy Management is SNMP, as three 
        MIBs are specified for Energy Management: the energy object 
        context MIB [EMAN-OBJECT-MIB], the energy monitoring MIB 
        [EMAN-MON-MIB], and the battery MIB [EMAN-BATTERY-MIB].  
        However, the EMAN requirement document [EMAN-REQ] also 
        requires support for a push model distribution of time series 
        values.  The following diagrams mention IPFIX [RFC5101] as one 
        possible solution for implementing a push mode transfer, 
        however this is for illustration purposes only.  The EMAN 
        standard does not require the use of IPFIX and acknowledges 
        that other alternative solutions may also be acceptable.

                  Figure 16: Complex Energy Management Model 
         
      
        While both the simple and complex Energy Management models 
        contain an EnMS, this framework doesn't impose any 
        requirements regarding a topology with a centralized EnMS(s) 
        or one with distributed Energy Management via the Energy 
        Objects within the deployment. 
         
        Given the pattern in Figure 16, the complex relationships 
        between Energy Objects can be modeled (refer also to section 
        5.3):   
             - A PoE device modeled as an Energy Object Parent with 
               the Power Source, Metering, and Proxy Relationships for 
               one or more Energy Object Children 
             - A PDU modeled as an Energy Object Parent with the Power 
               Source and Metering Relationships for the plugged in 
               Electrical Equipment (the Energy Object Children) 
             - Building management gateway, used as proxy for non IP 
               protocols, is modeled as an Energy Object Parent with 
               the Proxy Relationship, and potentially the Aggregation 
               Relationship to the managed Electrical Equipment  
             - Etc. 
      
     (*) If there is any communication between the Energy Object 
     Parent and Energy Object Children, it can be via EMAN and SNMP 
     (or IPFIX) but may be any other protocol IP or otherwise. 
         
       

         
        In the [EMAN-OBJECT-MIB], each Energy Object is managed with 
        an unique value of the entPhysicalIndex index from the ENTITY-
        MIB [RFC4133]  
         
        The ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133] specifies the notion of physical 
        containment tree, as: 
          "Each physical component may be modeled as 'contained' 
          within 
          another physical component.  A "containment-tree" is the 
          conceptual sequence of entPhysicalIndex values that uniquely 
          specifies the exact physical location of a physical 
          component within the managed system.  It is generated by 
          'following and recording' each 'entPhysicalContainedIn' 
          instance 'up the tree towards the root', until a value of 
          zero indicating no further containment is found."

        A Energy Object Component is a special Energy Object that is a 
        physical component as specified by the ENTITY-MIB physical 
        containment tree.  
         
         
       5. Energy Management Information Model 

        The following basic UML represents an information model 
        expression of the concepts in this framework.  This 
        information model, provided as a reference for implementers, 
        is represented as a MIB in the different related IETF Energy 
        Monitoring documents.  However, other programming structure 
        with different data models could be used as well. 
         
        Notation is a shorthand UML with lowercase types considered 
        platform or atomic types (i.e. int, string, collection). 
        Uppercase types denote classes described further.  Collections 
        and cardinality are expressed via qualifier notation.  
        Attributes labeled static are considered class variables and 
        global to the class.  Arrows indicate inheritance. Algorithms 
        for class variable initialization, constructors or destructors 
        are not shown. Attrbutes and structures are considered 
        readable and writeable prefixed by a dash (-) which indicates 
        readonly.

       6. Example Topologies 

         
        In this section we will give examples of how to use the Energy 
        Management framework.  In each example we will show how it can 
        be applied when Devices have the capability to model Power 
        Interfaces.  We will also show in each example how the 
        framework can be applied when devices cannot support Power 
        Interfaces but only monitor information or control the Device 
        as a whole. For instance a PDU may only be able to measure 
        power and energy for the entire unit without the ability to 
        distinguish among the inlets or outlet. 
      
        Together these examples show how the framework can be adapted 
        for Devices with different capabilities (typically hardware) 
        for Energy Management. 
         
        Given for all Examples:  
         
        Device W: A computer with one power supply. Power interface 1 
        is an inlets for Device W. 
         
        Device X: A computer with two power supplies. Power interface 
        1 and power interface 2 are both inlets for Device X. 
           
        Device Y: A PDU with multiple Power Interfaces numbered 0..10, 
        Power interface 0 is an inlet and power interface 1..10 are 
        outlets. 
      
        Device Z: A PDU with multiple Power Interfaces numbered 0..10, 
        Power interface 0 is an inlet and power interface 1..10 are 
        outlets. 
         
         
     6.1 Example I: Simple Device with one Source 

         
        Topology:  
          Device W inlet 1 is plugged into Device Y outlet 8. 
                   
        With Power Interfaces: 
           
          Device W has an Energy Object representing the computer 
          itself as well as one Power Interface defined as an inlet.  
           
          Device Y would have an Energy Object representing the PDU 
          itself (the Device) with a Power Interface 0 defined as an 
          inlet and Power Interfaces 1..10 defined as outlets.

          The interfaces of the devices would have a Power Source 
          Relationship such that: 
          Device W inlet 1 is powered by Device Y outlet 8 
         
        Without Power Interfaces: 
                
          In this case Device W has an Energy Object representing the 
          computer.  Device Y would have an Energy Object representing 
          the PDU.  
           
          The devices would have a Power Source Relationship such 
          that: 
          Device W is powered by Device Y. 
           
         
     6.2 Example II: Multiple Inlets 

         
        Topology:  
          Device X inlet 1 is plugged into Device Y outlet 8. 
          Device X inlet 2 is plugged into Device Y outlet 9. 
         
        With Power Interfaces: 
      
          Device X has an Energy Object representing the computer 
          itself. It contains two Power Interface defined as inlets.  
           
          Device Y would have an Energy Object representing the PDU 
          itself  (the Device) with a Power Interface 0 defined as an 
          inlet and Power Interface 1..10 defined as outlets.  
        
           
          The interfaces of the devices would have a Power Source 
          Relationship such that: 
          Device X inlet 1 is powered by Device Y outlet 8 
          Device X inlet 2 is powered by Device Y outlet 9 
         
        Without Power Interfaces: 
                
          In this case Device X has an Energy Object representing the 
          computer. Device Y would have an Energy Object representing 
          the PDU.  
           
          The devices would have a Power Source Relationship such 
          that: 
          Device X is powered by Device Y.

          Device X inlet 2 is plugged into Device Z outlet 9 
         
        With Power Interfaces: 
      
          Device X has an Energy Object representing the computer 
          itself. It contains two Power Interface defined as inlets.  
           
          Device Y would have an Energy Object representing the PDU

          inlet and Power Interface 1..10 defined as outlets.

          In this case Device X has an Energy Object representing the 
          computer. Device Y and Z would both have respective Energy 
          Objects representing each entire PDU.  
           
          The devices would have a Power Source Relationship such 
          that: 
          Device X is powered by Device Y and powered by Device Z. 
         
         
         
     7.    Relationship with Other Standards  

      

        This power management framework should, as much as possible, 
        reuse existing standards efforts, especially with respect to 
        information modeling and data modeling [RFC3444].  

         

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires August, 2013        [Page 58] 
         





     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        The data model for power and energy related objects is based 
        on IEC 61850.   

         

        Specific examples include: 

         

        The scaling factor, which represents Energy Object usage 
        magnitude, conforms to the IEC 61850 definition of unit 
        multiplier for the SI (System International) units of measure.  

         

        The electrical characteristic is based on the ANSI and IEC 
        Standards, which require that we use an accuracy class for 
        power measurement.  ANSI and IEC define the following accuracy 
        classes for power measurement:  

         

        IEC 62053-22  60044-1 class 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1  3.    

         

        ANSI C12.20 class 0.2, 0.5 

         

        The electrical characteristics and quality adheres closely to 
        the IEC 61850 7-2 standard for describing AC measurements.   

         

        The power state definitions are based on the DMTF Power State 
        Profile and ACPI models, with operational state extensions.  
         

     8.       Security Considerations 

        Regarding the data attributes specified here, some or all may 
        be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
        environments. Reading or writing these attributes without 
        proper protection such as encryption or access authorization 
        may have negative effects on the network capabilities. 
         
        Security Considerations for SNMP 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>         Expires August, 2013        [Page 59] 
         





     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
         

        Readable objects in a MIB modules (i.e., objects with a MAX-
        ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive 
        or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus 
        important to control GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects 
        and possibly to encrypt the values of these objects when 
        sending them over the network via SNMP.   

         

        The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment 
        without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
        network operations.  For example: 

         

        Unauthorized changes to the Energy Management Domain or 
        business context of an Energy Object may result in 
        misreporting or interruption of power. 

        Unauthorized changes to a power state may disrupt the power 
        settings of the different Energy Objects, and therefore the 
        state of functionality of the respective Energy Objects. 

        Unauthorized changes to the demand history may disrupt proper 
        accounting of energy usage.  

         

        With respect to data transport SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 
        did not include adequate security.  Even if the network itself 
        is secure (for example, by using IPsec), there is still no 
        secure control over who on the secure network is allowed to 
        access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in 
        these MIB modules. 

         

        It is recommended that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 
        cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 

         

        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is not 
        recommended.  Instead, it is recommended to deploy SNMPv3 and

     Internet-Draft           <EMAN Framework>        February 2013 
      
        to enable cryptographic security.  It is then a 
        customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
        entity giving access to an instance of these MIB modules is 
        properly configured to give access to the objects only to 
        those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to GET or 
        SET (change/create/delete) them. 

         

         

     9.       IANA Considerations 

      
        Initial values for the Power State Sets, together with the 
        considerations for assigning them, are defined in [EMAN-MON-
        MIB].
