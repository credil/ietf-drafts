    Extensions to OSPF facilitating the deployment of non-backward-
                          compatible changes.

Abstract

   This document specifies a generic mechanism that facilitates the
   deployment of non-backward-compatible changes in OSPF protocol.  This
   mechanism allows the OSPF routers to advertise the capability of non-
   backward-compatible functionality and to make the functionality
   operational only when supported by all participating routers.
   Depending on the functionality scope, capability advertisements must
   be propagated across a link, area or autonomous system (AS).  For
   link and area scope functionality, Router Information Link State
   Advertisement (LSA) is utilized to propagate the capability
   information.  For the cases when compatibility must be maintained
   across the whole OSPF autonomous system, new Area Information (AI)
   LSA is introduced.  The AI LSA is a TLV-based analog of Indication-
   LSA that is used for demand circuit functionality and described in
   RFC1793.

Internet-Draft        OSPF Non-Backward-Compatible             July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The evolution of OSPF protocol brought up changes that are not
   backward-compatible.  Some of those changes (for example
   RFC1583Compatibility flag) can cause a routing loop in mixed
   environments.  It therefore requires careful deployment planning,
   which is difficult to achieve in complex multivendor topologies.
   Most importantly, the lack of standard extendable mechanism that
   facilitates the deployment of non-backward-compatible changes
   obstructs the development of new protocol extensions.

   As a solution for the above described problems, this document
   proposes an extendable mechanism, which guarantees that the non-
   backward-compatible functionality is turned on only when supported by
   all participating routers.

   The proposed mechanism is not new; the existing demand circuit
   functionality [DEMAND] uses the same approach.  This document simply
   makes the solution generic.


2.  Method to deploy non-backward-compatible changes

   Each participating router advertises the capability of functionality
   that it supports in the Router Information LSA as described in RFC
   4970 [OSPF-CAP].  Routers only turn on a new functionality when all
   routers support it and revert back to their original behavior as soon
   as one incompatible device is detected.

   The scope of functionality could be link, area or AS wide.  For link
   and area wide, the router accordingly originates a link or area scope
   RI LSA.  For AS functionality, an area scope RI LSA is used.  To
   propagate compatibility information across area borders, a new LSA
   type Area Information is introduced.


3.  Area Information LSA

   The Area Border Router inserts a particular capability TLV into an
   Area Information (AI) LSA to signal that at least one router in the
   attached areas does not support the functionality.  Therefore, the
   presence of a particular TLV in AI LSA signals the opposite case to
   the presence of the same TLV in RI LSA.  The AI LSA origination
   algorithm is very similar to the algorithm of Indication-LSA
   origination [DEMAND] and outlined below in Section 3.3.  The AI LSA
   format is very similar to RI LSA [OSPF-CAP].  In OSPFv2, the AI LSA
   will be implemented with a new opaque LSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the AI
   LSA will be implemented with a new LSA type function code.  In both

   protocols, the AI LSA will have an area flooding scope.  The exact
   format of AI LSA is outlined in the sections 3.1 and 3.2.

3.1.  OSPFv2 Area Information (AI) Opaque LSA

   OSPFv2 routers will advertise an area-scoped Opaque-LSA [OPAQUE].
   The OSPFv2 Area Information LSA has a Link-State type of 10
   indicating that the flooding scope is area-local, an Opaque type of
   TBD and Opaque ID of 0.

   The format of the TLVs within the body of an AI LSA is exactly the
   same as the corresponding RI LSA TLV format, which in turn is the
   same as the format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF
   [TE].  The LSA payload consists of one or more nested Type/Length/
   Value (TLV) triplets.  The format of each TLV is:


        0                   1                   2                   3

   The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
   (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).  The TLV
   is padded to a 4-octet alignment; padding is not included in the
   length field (so a 3-octet value would have a length of 3, but the
   total size of the TLV would be 8 octets).  Nested TLVs are also 32-
   bit aligned.  For example, a 1-byte value would have the length field
   set to 1, and 3 octets of padding would be added to the end of the
   value portion of the TLV.  Unrecognized types are ignored.

3.2.  OSPFv3 Area Information (AI) LSA

   The OSPFv3 Area Information LSA has a function code of TBD while the
   S1/S2 bits are set to 1/0, indicating the area flooding scope for the
   LSA.

   The U bit is set indicating that the OSPFv3 AI LSA should be flooded
   even if it is not understood.  The Link State ID (LSID) value for
   this LSA is 0.  This is unambiguous since an OSPFv3 router will only
   advertise a single AI LSA per flooding scope.

                       OSPFv3 Area Information LSA


   The format of the TLVs within the body of an AI LSA is defined in
   Section 3.1.  When new Area Information LSA TLV is defined, the
   specification MUST explicitly state whether the TLV is applicable to
   OSPFv2 only, OSPFv3 only, or both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

3.3.  Area Information LSA origination

   Through the origination of AI LSAs, information about the existence
   of incapable routers propagates from non-backbone areas, to the
   backbone area and from there to all other areas.  The following two
   cases summarize the requirements for an area border router to
   originate AI LSAs:

   1.  Suppose an area border router (Router X) is connected to a non-
   backbone OSPF area (Area A).  Furthermore, assume that Area A has an
   incapable router i.e. a router LSA without corresponding RI LSA TLV.
   Then Router X should originate the AI LSAs into all other directly
   connected areas, including the backbone area, in accordance with the
   guidelines of Section 3.3.1.

   2.  Suppose an area border router (Router X) is connected to the
   backbone OSPF area (Area 0.0.0.0).  Furthermore, assume that the
   backbone has an indication of an existing incapable device via either

   a) the existence of a router LSA without corresponding RI LSA TLV

   or

   b) AI LSAs that have been originated by routers other than Router X.
   Then Router X should originate AI LSAs into all other directly
   connected non-backbone areas, keeping the guidelines of Section 3.3.1
   in mind.

3.3.1.  Limiting Area Information LSA origination

   The following guidelines should be observed by an area border router
   (Router X) when originating AI LSAs in order to limit their number.
   First, AI LSAs with corresponding TLV are not originated into an Area
   A when A has incapable routers; i.e. router LSAs without
   corresponding RI LSA TLV.  Secondly, if another area border router
   has originated an AI LSA with corresponding TLV into Area A, and that
   area border router has a higher OSPF Router ID than Router X (same
   tie-breaker as for forwarding the address origination; see Section
   12.4.4.1 of [OSPF]), then Router X should not originate an AI LSA
   with corresponding TLV into Area A.


4.  Practical applications of the mechanism

   We propose the following new extensions to an already defined set of
   RI LSA informational capability bits:

4.1.  Area-scope non-backward-compatible extensions

   1) Use of complex metric [draft-giacalone-ospf-te-express-path] for
   "normal" SPF (non-cSPF MPLS-TE) calculation when the TBD operational
   capability bit is set.  This protocol extension is applicable to both
   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

4.2.  AS-scope non-backward-compatible extensions

   1) All routers set the RFC1583Compatibility parameter to "disabled"
   when the TBD+1 operational capability bit is set.  The setting for
   the bit is applicable to OSPFv2 only.

   2) Synchronize the ospfReferenceBandwidth [OSPF-MIB] parameter across
   the Autonomous System when the TBD+2 operational capability bit is
   set.

   First, support of the capability of ospfReferenceBandwidth
   synchronization is verified across all routers in the autonomous
   system, using the above described backward compatibility mechanism.
   After verification is done, a different mechanism is used to
   propagate the TLV with encapsulated ospfReferenceBandwidth value
   across the OSPF autonomous system.  The rest of this Section
   describes this mechanism.

   Only the router with the highest ospfReferenceBandwidth value in the
   OSPF domain will advertise the value in Router Information LSA TLV.
   If two routers have the same ospfReferenceBandwidth value, then the
   OSPF Router ID will be a tie-breaker and the router with the lower ID
   should stop the RI LSA TLV origination.  All routers in the
   autonomous system MUST accept the ospfReferenceBandwidth value.

   The router does not start to advertise its ospfReferenceBandwidth
   value until one of the folloing situations takes place:

   - Router receives LSA with TLV with a smaller ospfReferenceBandwidth
   value

   - Router receives LSA with TLV with the same ospfReferenceBandwidth
   value but smaller Router ID

   - At least one neighbor went to full state but no LSA with TLV was
   received

   - Router receives MaxAge LSA with TLV from other router and the LSA
   is flushed from our database

   Router stops LSA TLV advertisement when one of two situation take

   place:

   - LSA with higher ospfReferenceBandwidth value was received

   - LSA with the same ospfReferenceBandwidth value was received but has
   a higher OSPF Router ID.

   A router MAY automatically generate the value of the
   ospfReferenceBandwidth based on the maximum value of its link
   bandwidth.

   A router MAY introduce a RI LSA TVL origination delay that is based
   on the OSPF Router ID and ospfReferenceBandwidth value in order to
   decrease excessive TVL origination in the exeptional case where all
   routers comes up at exact the same time.

   The advertisement is encapsulated into area scope RI LSA and then
   carried out by AI LSA into other areas.  A separate TLV type number
   is used to propagate the ospfReferenceBandwidth value.

5.  Capability negotiation before adjacency is fully formed

   For negotiating link scope capability before adjacency is fully
   formed, link local signaling [LLS] should be used instead of RI LSA.
   An example of such a functionality would be a modification to OSPF
   adjacency formation FSM.


6.  FAQ

   Q1: Why don't we use another TLV Type rather than introducing a new
   OSPFv2 AI Opaque Type / OSPFv3 LSA type?

   A1: According to [OSPF-CAP], RI LSA is for router capability.  But
   here we are dealing with area capability.  We don't want to put a
   Lion into a cage that says reads "Tiger".

   Q2: Why do we use RI and AI LSA to transport ospfReferenceBandwidth
   TLV across OSPF AS ?

   A2: This helps to avoid the introduction of the separate OSPFv3 LSA /
   OSPFv2 Opaque type.  As a drawback - RI LSA becomes not only the
   vehicle for signaling functionality availability, but also transport
   for this functionality.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The following IANA assignments are to be made from existing
   registries:

   The OSPFv2 opaque LSA option type TBD will need to be reserved for
   the OSPFv2 AI opaque LSA via IETF Consensus.

   OSPFv3 LSA Function Codes TBD will need to be reserved for the OSPFv3
   Area Information (AI) LSA via Standards Action.

   Three OSPF Router Informational Capability Bits will need to be
   reserved.

   One Router Informational Capability TLV type will need to be reserved
   for ospfReferenceBandwidth via Standards Action.

   Both Standards Action and IETF Consensus registration procedures are
   described in the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a generic mechanism for deployment of non-
   backward-compatible changes and it introduces Area-Information LSA
   for AS scope compatibility, three new bits in RI LSA TLV and TLV to
   propagate ospfReferenceBandwidth value.  The security considerations
   for all those entities are as critical as the topology information
   currently advertised by the base OSPF protocol.  Security
   considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in [OSPF] and
   [OSPFV3].
