Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS                July 2012 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   For leveraging the economics of scale, today's cloud data centers 
   tend to contain tens to hundreds of thousands of servers. Moreover
   distributed computing and server virtualization are increasingly 
   adopted in today's cloud data centers. These factors lead to 
   significant scaling, performance, and operational challenges for 
   cloud data center networks. Therefore, to design a scalable and 
   sustainable cloud data center network solution, the following 
   requirements must be taken into account: 

   1) LAN Extension 

      To achieve service agility and business continuance, Virtual 
      Machine (VM) migration and High-Available (HA) cluster are 
      commonly used in today's cloud data centers. These two 
      applications introduce special requirements on data center 
      networks. For instance, to allow a VM to be freely migrated from 
      one server to another within data centers while retaining its IP 
      address and MAC address, the LAN where the VM is located needs to 
      be extend across multiple racks or pods within data centers. In 
      addition, as some HA cluster applications rely on link-local 
      multicast for cluster member discovery and heartbeat, cluster 
      member servers are usually required to reside within the same 
      Layer2 domain. As a result, LAN extension becomes a fundamental 
      requirement for cloud data center networks. 

   2) VPN Instance Space Scalability 

      In modern cloud data centers, tens of thousands of tenants (e.g., 
      enterprises or governments who consume computing resources such 
      as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offered by cloud service 
      providers), could be hosted over a shared network infrastructure. 
      For security and performance isolation considerations, these 
      tenants SHOULD be isolated from one another. Hence, cloud data 
      center networks SHOULD provide a large enough VPN instance space 
      for tenant isolation.  

   3) Forwarding Table Scalability  

      In a highly virtualized cloud data center environment, it's not 
      uncommon that millions of VMs are contained over a common network 
      infrastructure. Therefore, the forwarding table of each network 
      device within cloud data center networks SHOULD be scalable 
      enough so as to keep up with that scale of VMs.

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS                July 2012 
 
   4) Bandwidth Utilization Maximization 

      In modern cloud data centers, distributed computing is driving the 
      server-to-sever traffic to become the dominating traffic compared 
      to the client-to-server traffic. To meet the growing capacity 
      demands for server-to-server connectivity, shortest path 
      forwarding and Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) have already been the 
      basic capabilities of cloud data center networks. 

   5) ARP/Unknown Unicast Flood Suppression 

      It's well-known that the flooding of ARP broadcast and unknown 
      unicast traffic within large Layer2 networks will lead to 
      performance impact on both networks and hosts. As the Layer2 
      domain is extended across multiple racks or pods within data 
      centers, the above problem will become even worse. As such, how 
      to suppress the flooding of ARP broadcast and unknown unicast 
      traffic within cloud data centers becomes increasingly desirable. 

   6) Flexibility for Tradeoffs between Bandwidth and State 

      It's possible that there would be a great difference between 
      tenants within a cloud data center, in terms of VM numbers or 
      multicast/broadcast traffic volume. For example, some tenants may 
      have seldom VMs while others may have a lot of VMs, or some 
      tenants may have a high volume of multicast/broadcast traffic 
      while others may have little or even no multicast/broadcast 
      traffic. As such, there is no "one size fits all" VPN 
      multicast/broadcast delivery procedure for these tenants. Hence, 
      cloud data center networks SHOULD support both the ingress 
      replication procedure and the multicast tree procedure for 
      delivering VPN multicast/broadcast traffic, so as to allow for an 
      effective tradeoff between bandwidth usage and state maintenance 
      on a per tenant basis according to the particular conditions of 
      each tenant. 

   7) Simplified Provisioning and Operation 

      It's not surprising that a single cloud data center has thousands 
      of physical switches (e.g., ToR switches). However, a network of 
      such scale usually implies a big challenge for data center 
      operators. Therefore, how to simplify and even automate network 
      provisioning and operation becomes significantly important for 
      cloud data center networks. 

   8) Reuse Existing Operation Experiences

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS                July 2012 
 
      IP, as a proven routing technology, has already been used in most 
      today's data centers. Furthermore, those service providers who 
      are planning to build cloud data centers have years of experience 
      in operating MPLS-based L2VPN and/or L3VPN services which can be 
      transported over MPLS or IP-enabled Packet Switching Networks 
      (PSNs). To allow data center operators to reuse their existing 
      network operation experiences, cloud data center network 
      solutions SHOULD reuse existing technologies and protocols where 
      appropriate, rather than reinventing the wheel. That's why there 
      are increasing interests from the industrial community on how to 
      adopt or adapt the existing L2VPN and/or L3VPN technologies for 
      cloud data center networks.  

   Although the existing VPLS solutions [RFC4761, RFC4762] can meet 
   most of the above requirements, there are still spaces for 
   improvement. For instance, the existing VPLS solutions require 
   establishing full-mesh of pseudo-wires (PWs) between PE routers, 
   which implies a significant scaling challenge in the cloud data 
   center environment, especially when imagining configuring thousands 
   of ToR switches as PE routers and provisioning tens of thousands of 
   VPLS instances on them; secondly, the ingress replication procedure 
   used for delivering multicast and broadcast traffic in existing VPLS 
   solutions is not optimal from the bandwidth utilization perspective; 
   thirdly, existing VPLS solutions require running one or more 
   separate protocols besides IGP within data centers for VPLS protocol 
   (e.g., LDP and/or BGP), which results in a certain complexity in 
   network management and operation, especially when considering 
   configuring BGP and VPLS parameters on thousands of ToR switches and 
   configuring thousands of BGP peers on aggregation or core switches.  

   Hence, this document describes a light-weight VPLS solution, 
   referred to as IS-IS VPLS, which uses IS-IS [IS-IS][RFC1195] for 
   VPLS protocol. IS-IS VPLS retains almost all advantages of existing 
   VPLS solutions (e.g., split-horizon forwarding) while overcoming 
   their shortages as mentioned above. For example, there is no need 
   for full-mesh PWs between PE routers in IS-IS VPLS. Furthermore, it 
   allows data center operators to flexibly make tradeoffs between 
   bandwidth and state on a per tenant basis. Finally, an already 
   deployed IGP within cloud data centers (i.e., IS-IS), rather than a 
   dedicated protocol(s), is used for providing VPLS services.  

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4664], [VPLS-MCAST], 
   [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].

3. Control Plane 

   There are two primary functions of the VPLS control plane: auto-
   discovery and signaling. In IS-IS VPLS, these two functions are 
   accomplished by using a single extended IS-IS TLV, referred to as 
   VPLS Info TLV (see section 3.1). By propagating such VPLS Info TLVs 
   that contain VPLS information within data center networks, PE 
   routers automatically discover which other PE routers are part of a 
   given VPLS instance and their assigned VPLS labels for that VPLS 
   instance. Furthermore, according to the ISIS specification defined 
   in [IS-IS] and [RFC1195], IS-IS routers would ignore unknown TLVs in 
   the LSP and pass them on to other neighbors unchanged. Therefore, P 
   routers don't need processing the VPLS info TLV, but instead 
   synchronizing the Link State PDUs (LSP) containing such TLV with 
   their adjacent IS-IS neighbors as normal. In addition, to overcome 
   the 255-byte TLV limit, IS-IS allows the interpretation of multiple 
   TLVs of a given type to be considered additive rather than mutually 
   exclusive (see section 6.4 in [RFC5311] for more details), therefore 
   there is no scaling issue in using IS-IS for propagating a huge 
   amount of VPLS information.

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS                July 2012 
 
       Type   

           Type code for VPLS Info TLV: TBD. 

       Length  

           Total number of bytes contained in the value field. 

       PE's IPv4 or IPv6 Address  

           This 128-bit field is filled with one of the originating PE 
           router's IPv4 or IPv6 addresses which are reachable across 
           the IP backbone. The address filled in this field SHOULD be 
           used as a tunnel destination address by remote PE routers 
           when these PE routers acting as ingress PE routers want to 
           tunnel a customer Ethernet frame to such PE router. If the 
           IP address is IPv4, the last four octets of this field are 
           filled with the IPv4 address while the remaining part is set 
           to zero. In other words, it is filled with an IPv4-mapped 
           IPv6 address. 

       VPLS ID  

           This field is filled with a 20-bit globally unique VPLS ID 
           for a particular attached VPLS instance. In case that a 
           larger VPLS ID space is required, the leftmost 12-bit 
           reserved field could be used together with the VPLS ID field 
           as an extended VPLS ID field. That is to say, the whole 32 
           bits are filled with a 32-bit long extended VPLS ID value. 

       VPLS Label 

           This field is filled with a 20-bit MPLS label corresponding 
           to the VPLS instance which is identified by the VPLS ID.  

   3.2. Auto-discovery 

   In IS-IS VPLS, each PE router could automatically discover which 
   other PE routers are part of a given VPLS instance that is 
   identified by the globally unique VPLS ID. This allows each PE 
   router to be configured with only the identities of the attached 
   VPLS instances, but not identities of all the other PE routers 
   belonging to these VPLS instances.

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS                July 2012 
 
   3.3. Signaling 

   In IS-IS VPLS, a PE router would assign the same VPLS label for a 
   given VPLS instance to any other PE router. As such, this VPLS label 
   is only used for identifying a particular VPLS instance, rather than 
   identifying both a particular VPLS instance and the corresponding 
   ingress PE router as a PW label does.  

4. Data Plane 

   4.1. Data Encapsulation and Forwarding 

   Since the VPLS label in IS-IS VPLS is only used for identifying a 
   particular VPLS instance, in the data-plane based MAC learning case 
   (see section 4.2.1), IP-based tunnel (e.g., GRE (Generic Routing 
   Encapsulation)/IP [RFC4023] or UDP [MPLS-in-UDP]) is RECOMMENDED to 
   be used as the PE-to-PE tunnel technology. As such, during the MAC 
   learning process, egress PE router could easily determine the 
   ingress PE router of the received VPLS packet from the tunnel source 
   address of that packet. Note that, in the control-plane based MAC 
   learning case (see section 4.2.2), there is no special requirement 
   for PE-to-PE tunnel technology in comparison with existing VPLS 
   solutions. The following sub-sections are based on an assumption 
   that IP tunnels are used between PE routers. 

    4.1.1. Unicast 

   For known unicast, MAC-in-MPLS-in-IP encapsulation [RFC4448] is used. 
   For unknown unicast, the encapsulation and forwarding procedures are 
   the same as that for multicast/broadcast described in the following 
   section. 

    4.1.2. Multicast/Broadcast  

   There are two major modes for delivering multicast and broadcast in 
   IS-IS VPLS: ingress replication mode and P-Multicast tree mode. P-
   Multicast tree mode further includes two sub-options: non-
   aggregative P-Multicast tree mode where one P-Multicast distribution 
   tree in the IP backbone is exclusively used by a single VPLS 
   instance, and aggregative P-Multicast tree mode in which one P-
   Multicast tree is shared by more than one VPLS instance. The 
   corresponding encapsulation for each mode is described in the 
   following sub-sections.

Internet-Draft                VPLS Using IS-IS                July 2012 
 
   4.1.2.1. Ingress Replication Mode 

   In the ingress replication mode, an ingress PE router forward the 
   received customer multicast/broadcast frames towards remote PE 
   routers in separate tunnels. Hence, the encapsulation in this mode 
   has no difference from that for unicast. 

   4.1.2.2. Non-aggregative P-Multicast Tree Mode 

   In the non-aggregative P-Multicast tree mode, MAC-in-IP 
   encapsulation is used directly since the destination IP address 
   (i.e., multicast address) contained in the IP-based tunnel header is 
   enough for egress PE routers to determine which VPLS instance the 
   received VPLS packet belongs to. 

   4.1.2.3. Aggregative P-Multicast Tree Mode 

   For the aggregative P-Multicast tree mode, MAC-in-MPLS-in-IP 
   encapsulation SHOULD be used. Furthermore, the MPLS label here 
   SHOULD be treated as an upstream-assigned label. For example, assume 
   a PE router has assigned a local label L for a given VPLS instance 
   and advertised that VPLS information using the VPLS Info TLV before, 
   when this PE router wants to send a multicast VPLS packet of that 
   VPLS instance through the corresponding aggregative P-Multicast tree, 
   label L as an upstream-assigned label will be contained in that VPLS 
   packet. 

   4.2. MAC Address Learning 

   MAC addresses of local CE hosts would still be learnt by PE routers 
   as normal bridges. 

   As for learning MAC addresses of remote CE hosts, IS-IS VPLS 
   provides two options: data-plane based MAC learning and control-
   plane based MAC learning. If unknown unicast flood suppression is 
   required even at the cost of consuming more forwarding table 
   resources, the control-plane based MAC learning option could be 
   considered. Otherwise, the data-plane based MAC learning option 
   SHOULD be preferred. 

    4.2.1. Data-plane based MAC Learning 

   Upon receiving an VPLS packet from a remote PE router, the MPLS 
   label contained in the packet (or the tunnel destination IP address 
   in the non-aggregative P-Multicast tree case) is used to determine 
   the particular VPLS instance that the packet belongs to, while the

   tunnel source IP address is used to tell from which ingress PE 
   router the packet was sent.  

    4.2.2. Control-plane based MAC Learning 

   In IS-IS VPLS, MAC addresses of remote CE hosts can also be learnt 
   on the control plane by using the MAC-Reachability TLV defined in 
   [RFC6165].  

   Upon learning the MAC addresses of their local CE hosts, PE routers 
   would immediately advertise these MAC addresses to other PE routers 
   of the same VPN instance by using the MAC-Reachability TLV defined 
   in [RFC6165]. One or more MAC-Reachability TLVs are carried in a LSP 
   which in turn is encapsulated with an Ethernet header. The source 
   MAC address is the originating PE router's MAC address whereas the 
   destination MAC address is a to-be-defined multicast MAC address 
   specifically identifying IS-IS VPLS PE routers. Such LSPs are 
   forwarded towards remote PE routers as customer Ethernet frames by 
   ingress PE routers. Egress PE routers receiving the above packets 
   SHOULD intercept them and accordingly process them. IP address of 
   the PE router originating these MAC routes could be derived either 
   from the "IP Interface Address" field contained in the corresponding 
   LSPs (Note that the IP address here SHOULD be identical with that 
   contained in the VPLS Info TLV) or from the tunnel source IP address 
   of the VPLS packet containing such MAC routes. 

   Since these LSPs are fully transparent to P routers, there is no 
   impact on the control plane of P routers. More details about the 
   control-plane based MAC learning procedure are for further study. 

5. ARP Broadcast Reduction 

   To suppress ARP broadcast flood within a given VPLS instance, ARP 
   cache mechanism can be enabled on PE routers. For more details about 
   ARP cache mechanism, please refer to [ARP-Reduction] 

6. Security Considerations 

   This document doesn't introduce additional security risk to IS-IS 
   and VPLS, nor does it provide any additional security feature for 
   IS-IS and VPLS. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   The IS-IS TLV type code for VPLS Info TLV is required to be defined 
   by IANA.
