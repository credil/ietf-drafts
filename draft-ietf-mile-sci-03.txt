Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Apr 2012


1.  Introduction

   Cyber attacks are getting more sophisticated, and their numbers are
   increasing day by day.  To cope with such situation, incident
   information needs to be reported, exchanged, and shared among
   organizations.  IODEF is one of the tools enabling such exchange, and
   is already in use.

   To efficiently run cybersecurity operations, these exchanged
   information needs to be machine-readable.  IODEF provides a
   structured means to describe the information, but it needs to embed
   various non-structured such information in order to convey detailed
   information.  Further structure within IODEF increases IODEF
   documents' machine-readability and thus facilitates streamlining
   cybersecurity operations.

   On the other hand, there exist various other activities facilitating
   detailed and structured description of cybersecurity information,
   major of which includes CAPEC [CAPEC], CEE [CEE], CPE [CPE], CVE
   [CVE], CVRF [CVRF], CVSS [CVSS], CWE [CWE], CWSS [CWSS], OCIL [OCIL],
   OVAL [OVAL], and XCCDF [XCCDF].  Since such structured description
   facilitates cybersecurity operations, it would be beneficial to embed
   and convey these information inside IODEF document.

   To enable that, this document extends the IODEF to embed and convey
   various structured cybersecurity information, with which
   cybersecurity operations can be facilitated.  Since IODEF defines a
   flexible and extensible format and supports a granular level of
   specificity, this document defines an extension to IODEF instead of
   defining a new report format.  For clarity, and to eliminate
   duplication, only the additional structures necessary for describing
   the exchange of such structured information are provided.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document follows the one defined in RFC
   5070 [RFC5070].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Applicability

   To maintain cybersecurity, organization needs to exchange
   cybersecurity information, which includes the following information:



Takahashi, et al.       Expires October 13, 2012                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Apr 2012


   attack pattern, platform information, vulnerability and weakness,
   countermeasure instruction, computer event log, and the severity.

   IODEF provides a scheme to exchange such information among interested
   parties.  However, the detailed common format to describe such
   information is not defined in the IODEF base document.

   On the other hand, to describe those information and to facilitate
   exchange, a structured format for that is already available.  Major
   of them are CAPEC, CEE, CPE, CVE, CVRF, CVSS, CWE, CWSS, OCIL, OVAL,
   and XCCDF.  By embedding them into the IODEF document, the document
   can convey more detailed contents to the receivers, and the document
   can be easily reused.  Note that interactive communication is needed
   in some cases, and some of these structured information, e.g., OCIL
   information, solicits reply from recipients.  These reply could be
   also embedded inside the IODEF document.

   These structured cybersecurity information facilitates cybersecurity
   operation at the receiver side.  Since the information is machine-
   readable, the data can be processed by computers.  That expedites the
   automation of cybersecurity operations

   For instance, an organization wishing to report a security incident
   wants to describe what vulnerability was exploited.  Then the sender
   can simply use IODEF, where an CAPEC record is embedded instead of
   describing everything in free format text.  Receiver can also
   identify the needed details of the attack pattern by looking up some
   of the xml [XML1.0] tags defined by CAPEC.  Receiver can accumulate
   the attack pattern information (CAPEC record) in its database and
   could distribute it to the interested parties if needed, without
   needing human interventions.


4.  Extension Definition

   This draft extends IODEF to embed structured cybersecurity
   information by introducing new classes, with which these information
   can be embedded inside IODEF document as element contents of
   AdditionalData and RecordItem classes.

4.1.  List of Supported Structured Cybersecurity Information
      Specifictions

   This extension embeds structured cybersecurity information from
   external specifications.  The initial list of supported
   specifications is listed below.  Each entry has namespace [XMLNames],
   specification name, version, reference URI and applicable classes for
   each specification.  Arbitrary URIs that may help readers to

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Apr 2012


   understand the specification could be embedded inside the Reference
   URI field, but it is recommended that standard/informational URI
   describing the specification is prepared and is embedded here.

   Future assignments are to be managed by IANA using the Expert Review
   [RFC5226] and Specification Required [RFC5226] allocation policies as
   further specified in Section 7.

   The SpecID attributes of extended classes (Section 4.3) must allow
   the values of the specifications' namespace fields, but otherwise,
   implementations are not required to support all the above
   specifications.  Implementations may choose which specifications to
   support, though CVE 1.0 (Section 4.1.7) needs to be minimally
   supported, as described in Section 5.  In case an implementation
   received a data it does not support, it may expand its functionality
   by looking up the IANA table or notify the sender of its inability to
   parse the data by using any means defined outside the scope of this
   specification.

4.3.1.  AttackPattern

   An AttackPattern consists of an extension to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   extension describes attack patterns of incidents or events.

   It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the
   extension elements whenever available.

   An AttackPattern class is structured as follows.

   +------------------------+
   | AttackPattern          |
   +------------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID            |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID      |<>--(0..*)-[ Reference ]
   | STRING AttackPatternID |<>--(0..*)-[ Platform ]
   +------------------------+

                       Figure 2: AttackPattern class

   This class has the following attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The identifier of the specification
      specifying the format of the RawData element.  The value should be
      chosen from the namespaces [XMLNames] listed in Section 4.1 or
      "private".  Note that the lists in Section 4.1 will be developed
      further by IANA.  In case a RawData or Reference element is
      provided along with this attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure
      that this value is consistent with the one provided by the
      element; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
      prefer this attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so
      a human can correct the problem.  The value "private" is prepared
      for conveying RawData based on a format that is not listed in the
      table.  This is usually used for conveying data formatted
      according to an organization's private schema.  When the value
      "private" is used, ext-SpecID element needs to be used.

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The identifier of the specification
      specifying the format of the RawData element.  When this element
      is used, the value of SpecID element must be "private."  In case a
      RawData or Reference element is provided along with this
      attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this value is
      consistent with the one provided by the element; if a reader/
      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this
      attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.

   AttackPatternID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of an attack
      pattern to be reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever
      such identifier is available, but could be omitted if no such one
      is available.  In this case, either RawData or Reference elements,
      or both of them, MUST be provided.  In case a RawData or Reference
      element is provided along with this attribute, writers/senders
      MUST ensure that this value is consistent with the one provided by
      the element; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it
      SHOULD prefer this attribute's value, and SHOULD log the
      inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

   The AttackPattern class is composed of the following aggregate
   classes.

   RawData:  Zero or more.  XMLDATA.  A complete document that is
      formatted according to the specification and its version
      identified by the value of the SpecID with the Section 4.1.

   Reference:  Zero or more of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  This element
      allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured
      information instead of directly embedding it into a RawData
      element.

   Platform:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform involved
      in the specific attack pattern, which is elaborated in
      Section 4.3.2.  Some of the structured information embedded in the
      RawData element may include the identifier within it.  In this
      case, this Platform element SHOULD NOT be used.  If a reader/
      receiver detects the identifiers in both RawData and Platform
      elements and their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the identifiers
      derived from the Platform element, and SHOULD log the
      inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.2.  Platform

   A Platform identifies a software platform.  It is recommended that
   AttackPattern, Vulnerability, Weakness, and System classes contain
   this elements whenever available.

   A Platform element is structured as follows.

   PlatformID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of a platform to be
      reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such identifier
      is available, but could be omitted if no such one is available.
      In this case, either RawData or Reference elements, or both of
      them, MUST be provided.  In case a RawData or Reference element is

   Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and version
   identified by the SpecID are consistent with the contents of the ID;
   if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the
   specification name and version derived from the content, and SHOULD
   log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.3.  Vulnerability

   A Vulnerability consists of an extension to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   extension describes the (candidate) vulnerabilities of incidents or
   events.

   It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the
   extension elements whenever available.

   A Vulnerability element is structured as follows.

      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this
      attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.  The value "private" is prepared for

      table.  This is usually used for conveying data formatted
      according to an organization's private schema.  When the value
      "private" is used, ext-SpecID element needs to be used.

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The identifier of the specification
      specifying the format of the RawData element.  When this element
      is used, the value of SpecID element must be "private."  In case a
      RawData or Reference element is provided along with this
      attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this value is
      consistent with the one provided by the element; if a reader/
      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this
      attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.

   VulnerabilityID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of a
      vulnerability to be reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used
      whenever such identifier is available, but could be omitted if no
      such one is available.  In this case, either RawData or Reference
      elements, or both of them, MUST be provided.  In case a RawData or
      Reference element is provided along with this attribute, writers/
      senders MUST ensure that this value is consistent with the one
      provided by the element; if a reader/receiver detects an
      inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this attribute's value, and SHOULD
      log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

   This class is composed of the following aggregate classes.

   RawData:  Zero or one.  XMLDATA.  A complete document that is
      formatted according to the specification and its version
      identified by the value of the SpecID with the Section 4.1.

   Reference:  Zero or one of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  This element
      allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured
      information instead of directly embedding it into a RawData
      element.

   Platform:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform affected
      by the vulnerability, which is elaborated in Section 4.3.2.  Some
      of the structured information embedded in the RawData element may
      include the identifier within it.  In this case, this element
      SHOULD NOT be used.  If a reader/receiver detects the identifiers
      in both RawData and Platform elements and their inconsistency, it
      SHOULD prefer the identifiers derived from the Platform element,

      and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the
      problem.

   Scoring:  Zero or more.  An indicator of the severity of the
      vulnerability, such as CVSS and CCSS scores, which is elaborated
      in Section 4.3.4.  Some of the structured information may include
      scores within it.  In this case, the Scoring element SHOULD NOT be
      used since the RawData element contains the scores.  If a reader/
      receiver detects scores in both RawData and Scoring elements and
      their inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the scores derived from the
      RawData element, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.

4.3.4.  Scoring

   A Scoring class describes the scores of the severity in terms of
   security.  It is recommended that Vulnerability and Weakness classes
   contain the elements whenever available.

   A Scoring class is structured as follows.

   +----------------------+
   | Scoring              |
   +----------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID          |<>---------[ ScoreSet ]

   This class has two attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The identifier of the specification
      specifying the format of the RawData element.  The value should be
      chosen from the namespaces [XMLNames] listed in Section 4.1.  Note
      that the lists in Section 4.1 will be developed further by IANA.
      In case a RawData or Reference element is provided along with this
      attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this namespace is
      consistent with the one provided by the element; if a reader/
      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer the value of
      this attribute, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.  The value "private" is prepared for
      conveying RawData based on a format that is not listed in the
      table.  This is usually used for conveying data formatted
      according to an organization's private schema.  When the value
      "private" is used, ext-SpecID element needs to be used.

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The identifier of the specification
      specifying the format of the RawData element.  When this element
      is used, the value of SpecID element must be "private."  In case a
      RawData or Reference element is provided along with this
      attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this value is
      consistent with the one provided by the element; if a reader/
      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this

   This class is composed of an aggregate class.

   ScoreSet:  One. XMLDATA.  A complete document that is formatted
      according to the specification and its version identified by the
      value of the SpecID with the Section 4.1.  This element includes a
      set of score information.

   Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and version
   identified by the SpecID are consistent with the contents of the
   Score; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.5.  Weakness

   A Weakness consists of an extension to the
   Incident.Method.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The
   extension describes the weakness types of incidents or events.

   It is recommended that Method class SHOULD contain one or more of the
   extension elements whenever available.

   A Weakness element is structured as follows.

   +----------------------+
   | Weakness             |

      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this
      attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.  The value "private" is prepared for
      conveying RawData based on a format that is not listed in the
      table.  This is usually used for conveying data formatted
      according to an organization's private schema.  When the value
      "private" is used, ext-SpecID element needs to be used.

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The identifier of the specification

      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this
      attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.

   WeaknessID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of a weakness to be
      reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such identifier
      is available, but could be omitted if no such one is available.
      In this case, either RawData or Reference elements, or both of
      them, MUST be provided.  In case a RawData or Reference element is

   Platform:  Zero or more.  An identifier of software platform affected
      by the weakness, which is elaborated in Section 4.3.2.  Some of
      the structured information embedded in the RawData element may
      include the identifier within it.  In this case, this element
      SHOULD NOT be used.  If a reader/receiver detects the identifiers
      in both RawData and Platform elements and their inconsistency, it
      SHOULD prefer the identifiers derived from the Platform element,
      and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the
      problem.

   Scoring:  Zero or more.  An indicator of the severity of the
      weakness, such as CWSS score, which is elaborated in
      Section 4.3.4.  Some of the structured information may include
      scores within it.  In this case, the Scoring element SHOULD NOT be

      attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this value is
      consistent with the one provided by the element; if a reader/
      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this
      attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.  The value "private" is prepared for
      conveying RawData based on a format that is not listed in the
      table.  This is usually used for conveying data formatted
      according to an organization's private schema.  When the value
      "private" is used, ext-SpecID element needs to be used.

   ext-SpecID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  The identifier of the specification
      specifying the format of the RawData element.  When this element
      is used, the value of SpecID element must be "private."  In case a
      RawData or Reference element is provided along with this
      attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this value is

      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this
      attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can
      correct the problem.

   EventID:  OPTIONAL.  STRING.  An identifier of an event to be
      reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such identifier
      is available, but could be omitted if no such one is available.
      In this case, either RawData or Reference elements, or both of
      them, MUST be provided.  In case a RawData or Reference element is
      provided along with this attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure
      that this value is consistent with the one provided by the
      element; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
      prefer this attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so

   Reference:  Zero or one of iodef:Reference [RFC5070].  This element
      allows an IODEF document to include a link to a structured
      information instead of directly embedding it into a RawData
      element.

   This class MUST contain at least one of RawData or Reference
   elements.  Writers/senders MUST ensure the specification name and
   version identified by the SpecID are consistent with the contents of
   the RawData; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.7.  Verifcation

   A Verification consists of an extension to the
   Incident.AdditionalData element with a dtype of "xml".  The extension
   elements describes incident on vefifying incidents.

   A Verification class is structured as follows.

   +----------------------+
   | Verification         |
   +----------------------+
   | ENUM SpecID          |<>--(0..*)-[ RawData ]
   | STRING ext-SpecID    |<>--(0..*)-[ Reference ]
   | STRING VerificationID|
   +----------------------+

                       Figure 8: Verification class

   This class has the following attributes.

   SpecID:  REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The identifier of the specification
      specifying the format of the RawData element.  The value should be
      chosen from the namespaces [XMLNames] listed in Section 4.1.  Note
      that the lists in Section 4.1 will be developed further by IANA.
      In case a RawData or Reference element is provided along with this
      attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this value is
      consistent with the one provided by the element; if a reader/
      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this

      RawData or Reference element is provided along with this
      attribute, writers/senders MUST ensure that this value is
      consistent with the one provided by the element; if a reader/
      receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD prefer this
      attribute's value, and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can

      to be reported.  This attribute SHOULD be used whenever such
      identifier is available, but could be omitted if no such one is
      available.  In this case, either RawData or Reference elements, or

   the RawData; if a reader/receiver detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD
   prefer the specification name and version derived from the content,
   and SHOULD log the inconsistency so a human can correct the problem.

4.3.8.  Remediation

   A Remediation consists of an extension to the Incident.AdditionalData
   element with a dtype of "xml".  The extension elements describes
   incident remediation information including instructions.

   It is recommended that Incident class SHOULD contain one or more of
   this extension elements whenever available.

   A Remediation class is structured as follows.

5.  Mandatory to Implement features

   The implementation of this draft needs to suffice the following.

      The CVE SpecID value and related values (e.g., namespace) MUST be
      implemented (implementation is capable of sending and receiving
      well-formed CVE 1.0 XML documents without error).

      The receiver MUST implement validation of received CVE 1.0 XML
      documents against the CVE 1.0 XML schema in order to detect
      invalid CVE documents.

      The receiver SHOULD validate all received CVE 1.0 XML documents as
      described in the above item.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a format for encoding a particular class of
   security incidents appropriate for exchange across organizations.  As
   merely a data representation, it does not directly introduce security
   issues.  However, it is guaranteed that parties exchanging instances
   of this specification will have certain concerns.  For this reason,
   the underlying message format and transport protocol used MUST ensure
   the appropriate degree of confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity for the specific environment.

   Organizations that exchange data using this document are URGED to
   develop operating procedures that document the following areas of
   concern.

6.1.  Transport-Specific Concerns

   The underlying messaging format and protocol used to exchange
   instances of the IODEF MUST provide appropriate guarantees of



Takahashi, et al.       Expires October 13, 2012               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Apr 2012


   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  The use of a
   standardized security protocol is encouraged.  The Real-time Inter-
   network Defense (RID) protocol [RFC6045] and its associated transport
   binding [RFC6046] provide such security.

   The critical security concerns are that these structured information
   may be falsified or they may become corrupt during transit.  In areas
   where transmission security or secrecy is questionable, the
   application of a digital signature and/or message encryption on each
   report will counteract both of these concerns.  We expect that each
   exchanging organization will determine the need, and mechanism, for
   transport protection.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML
   schemata[XMLschemaPart1][XMLschemaPart2] conforming to a registry
   mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Registration request for the IODEF structured cybersecurity
   information extension namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-sci-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

      XML: None

   Registration request for the IODEF structured cybersecurity
   information extension XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-sci-1.0

      Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section
      of the document.

      XML: Refer here to the XML Schema in the appendix of the document.

   This memo creates the following registry for IANA to manage:

      Name of the registry: "IODEF Structured Cyber Security Information
      Specifications"

      Namespace details: A registry entry for a Structured Cyber
      Security Information Specification (SCI specification) consists
      of:

Internet-Draft                IODEF-ext-sci                     Apr 2012


         Namespace: A URI [RFC3986] that is the XML namespace name used
         by the registered SCI specification.

         Specification Name: A string containing the spelled-out name of
         the SCI specification in human-readable form.

         Reference URI: A list of one or more of the URIs [RFC3986] from
         which the registered specification can be obtained.  The
         registered specification MUST be readily and publicly available
         from that URI.

         Applicable Classes: A list of one or more of the Extended
         Classes specified in Section 4.3 of this document.  The
         registered SCI specification MUST only be used with the
         Extended Classes in the registry entry.

      Information that must be provided to assign a new value: The above
      list of information.

      Fields to record in the registry: Namespace/Specification Name/
      Version/Applicable Classes.

      Initial registry contents: See sections from Section 4.1.1 through
      Section 4.1.17 above.

      Allocation Policy: Expert Review [RFC5226] and Specification
      Required [RFC5226].

   The Designated Expert is expected to consult with the mile (Managed
   Incident Lightweight Exchange) working group or its successor if any
   such WG exists (e.g., via email to the working group's mailing list).
   The Designated Expert is expected to retrieve the SCI specification
   from the provided URI in order to check the public availability of
   the specification and verify the correctness of the URI.  An
   important responsibility of the Designated Expert is to ensure that
   the registered Applicable Classes are appropriate for the registered
   SCI specification.
