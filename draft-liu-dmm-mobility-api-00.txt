                     Mobility API Extension for DMM
                     draft-liu-dmm-mobility-api-00

Abstract


   RFC 5014 specifies extension to socket API to allow application to
   specify the preference among multiple source addresses.
   draft-liu-dmm-address-selection-00 proposes to extend router
   advertisment message to carry the prefix type information.  The
   mobile node can learn the prefix type information from the router
   advertisment message.  This document proposes an extension to RFC
   5014 to enable the application to select the DMM related prefixes.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Extension of RFC 5014

   RFC 5014 defines socket API extension used for source address
   selection.  Application can use this API to override the default
   source address selection mechnism for IPv6.  Currently, RFC 5014
   defines the following type of source address selection preference:

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_HOME /* Prefer Home address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_COA /* Prefer Care-of address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP /* Prefer Temporary address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_PUBLIC /* Prefer Public address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_CGA /* Prefer CGA address as source */

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_NONCGA /* Prefer a non-CGA address as source */

   This document proposes to extend the above definition to add two new
   flags:

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_LOCAL_HNP:

   Prefer to use locally allocated home network prefix.

   IPV6_PREFER_SRC_REMOTE_HNP:

   Prefer to use the home network prefix that allocated by other access
   router instead of the one that the MN currently attach.


2.  Usage Example

   This section gives usage example for this API extension.

   In DMM scenario, the application on the mobile node can always select
   the IPV6_PREFER_SRC_LOCAL_HNP as the most preferred soure address.
   The mobile node's operating system need to guarantee that for the on-
   going session, it will not interupt the on-going session even there
   is a new prefix available.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
