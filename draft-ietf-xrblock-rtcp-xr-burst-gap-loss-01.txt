Internet-Draft           RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss             January 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Burst and Gap Loss Report Block

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the proportion of packets lost by the
   network.  The losses during loss bursts are reported, together with
   the number of bursts and additional data allowing the calculation of
   statistical parameters (mean and variance) of the distribution of
   burst lengths.  Some uses of these metrics depend on the availability
   of the metric "cumulative number of packets lost" from RTCP
   [RFC3550].

   This block provides information on transient IP problems.  Burst/Gap
   metrics are typically used in Cumulative reports however MAY be used
   in Interval reports.  The burstiness of packet loss affects user
   experience, may influence any sender strategies to mitigate the
   problem, and may also have diagnostic value.

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related terminal metrics
   defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).

   The definitions of Burst, Gap, Loss and Discard are consistent with
   definitions in [RFC3611].  To accommodate the range of jitter buffer
   algorithms and packet discard logic that may be used by implementors,
   the method used to distinguish between bursts and gaps may be an
   equivalent method to that defined in [RFC3611].  The method used
   SHOULD produce the same result as that defined in [RFC3611] for
   conditions of burst packet loss, but MAY produce different results
   for conditions of time varying jitter.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions or
   define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines in
   [RFC6390].

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Received, Lost and Discarded

      A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to arrive within an
      implementation-specific time window.  A packet that arrives within
      this time window but is too early or late to be played out shall
      be regarded as discarded.  A packet shall be classified as one of
      received (or OK), discarded or lost.


   Bursts and Gaps

      The terms Burst and Gap are used in a manner consistent with that
      of RTCP XR [RFC3611].  RTCP XR views a RTP stream as being divided
      into bursts, which are periods during which the loss rate is high
      enough to cause noticeable quality degradation (generally over 5
      percent loss rate), and gaps, which are periods during which lost
      packets are infrequent and hence quality is generally acceptable.

3.2.  Definition of Fields in Burst/Gap Loss Report Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Burst/Gap Loss Report Block is identified by the constant NBGL.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NBGL with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Packet Delay Variation
      metrics block is an Interval or a Cumulative report, that is,
      whether the reported values apply to the most recent measurement
      interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the
      Interval Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).

Internet-Draft           RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss             January 2012


    Loss and Discard Combination flag (C): 1 bit

      The 'C' flag is used to indicate whether combining loss/discard
      report is needed.  This field MUST be set to '1' if the burst gap
      loss report is present in conjunction with the burst gap discard
      report in the same compound RTCP packet and MUST be set to '0'
      otherwise.  If the burst gap discard is not sent with burst gap
      loss, then the receiver should discard burst gap loss with 'C'
      flag set to 1.  If the 'C' flag is set to 0, then receiver should
      not discard burst gap loss metric block when burst gap discard is
      not received.


   Reserved (resv): 7 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to zero by senders
      and MUST be ignored by receivers.


   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Delay block, the block length is equal to 5.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].


   Threshold: 8 bits

      The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e. the number
      of successive packets that must be received prior to and following
      a lost frame in order for this lost frame to be regarded as part
      of a gap.


   Sum of Burst Durations (ms): 24 bits

      The total duration of bursts of lost frames in the period of the
      report (Interval or Cumulative).

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
      be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.

Internet-Draft           RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss             January 2012


   Packets lost in bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets lost during loss bursts.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
      be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.


   Total packets expected in bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets expected during loss bursts (that is,
      the sum of received packets and lost packets).

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE SHOULD
      be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF SHOULD be reported.


   Number of bursts: 16 bits

      The number of bursts in the period of the report (Interval or
      Cumulative).

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.


   Sum of Squares of Burst Durations (ms-squared): 36 bits

      The sum of the squares of burst durations (where individual burst
      durations are expressed in ms) over in the period of the report
      (Interval or Cumulative).  The units for this quantity are
      milliseconds-squared.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFFE
      SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFFF SHOULD be
      reported.


3.3.  Derived metrics based on reported metrics

   The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
   this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
   Information block [MEASID] (which MUST be present in the same RTCP
   packet as the Burst/Gap Loss block) and also with the metric

Internet-Draft           RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss             January 2012


   "cumulative number of packets lost" provided in standard RTCP
   [RFC3550].

   These metrics provides information relevant to statistical
   parameters, including:

   o  The fraction of packets lost during bursts (i.e., Burst Loss Rate
      in [SUMSTAT])

   o  The fraction of packets lost during gaps (i.e., Gap Loss Rate in
      [SUMSTAT])

   o  burst duration mean [SUMSTAT]

   o  burst duration variance [SUMSTAT]

   The details on calculation these parameters in the metrics are
   described in [SUMSTAT].

4.  Considerations for Voice-over-IP applications

   This metric block is applicable to a broad range of RTP applications.
   Where the metric is used with a Voice-overIP (VoIP) application, the
   following considerations apply.

   RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
   during which the loss rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
   quality degradation (generally over 5 percent loss rate), and gaps,
   which are periods during which lost packets are infrequent and hence
   call quality is generally acceptable.

   If Voice Activity Detection is used the Burst and Gap Duration shall
   be determined as if silence frames had been sent, i.e. a period of
   silence in excess of Gmin frames MUST terminate a burst condition.

   The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in [RFC3611] results in
   a Burst being a period of time during which the call quality is
   degraded to a similar extent to a typical PCM Severely Errored Second
   [PSES].

5.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format =/ xr-bgl-block

   xr-bgl-block = "brst-gap-loss"

6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

6.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NDEL in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NBGL with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

6.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "brst-gap-loss" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

6.3.  Contact information for registrations


   The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
