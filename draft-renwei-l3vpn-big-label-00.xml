<section title="Introduction">

<t>
Network virtualization and server virtualization are being designed
and deployed in data center networks, and new data encapsulation methods and
protocols are being defined and specified, for example, VXLAN, NVGRE and
NVO3. The general idea is to add a new virtual network header so that a physical
network can be used to support millions (16M) of virtualized overlaid networks.
Network overlay virtualization have placed a new requirement on the access
method to such virtualized overlaid  networks.
</t>

<t>
BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, as specified in RFC 2547 and RFC 4364, provide a market-proven
technology and solution for end-to-end IP VPNs. In BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, all the
customer sites are connected to the service provider networks through PE-CE
link. It is desirable to extend the BGP/MPLS scheme so that customers can access
their virtualized networks hosted in a data center by using BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.
</t>

<t>
In the data plane of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, the customer VPN/VRF instances are
represented by an MPLS label (VPN label) locally assgined by the PE connecting
to CE. Since MPLS labels are 20 bits long, a PE can maximally support 1 million
VPNs/VRFs, which are not sufficient to support 16 millions of virtual networks
that are being standardized in VXLAN, NVGRE and NVO3. When BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are extended
to access virtualized networks in data centers, we will have to provide a solution
on how to associate a customer to a virtual network. This document will describe
some use cases and  specify
a solution to this problem.
</t>

<t>

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

<section title = "Use Cases and Scenarios">

<t>
In BGP/MPLS IP VPN reference models, at each site there are one or more Customer Edge (CE) devices,
each of which is attached to one or more Provider Edge (PE) routers via some
sort of attachment circuit such as PPP, Ethernet/VLAN, etc.
</t>

<t>
When the BGP/MPLS IP VPNs reference model is extended to connect to a virtual
network, the Customer Edge (CE) devices and Provider Edge (PE) devices on
the data center site can be physically the same device: it will be both the PE
device with respect to the VPN model and the NVE device with respect to the
network virtualization, as illustrated in the following diagram

In addition to the VPN PE functionalities of RFC 4364, PE-NVE will also perform
the functionalities of network overlay virtualization. In what follows we describe
three use cases for VXLAN, NVGRE, and NVO3, respectively.

<section title = "VXLAN">

In this use case, the VXLAN protocol of [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan] is
used for network overlay virtualiztion.

<section title = "NVO3">

<t> NVO3 is an on-going effort to standardize solutions to data center virtualizaiton
with the goal of providing viable data encapsulation and protocols across a scaling
range of a few thousand VMs to several million VMs running on greater than
one hundred thousand physical servers. NVO3 considers approaches to
multi-tenancy that reside at the network layer rather than using traditional
isolation mechanisms that rely on the underlying layer 2 technology (e.g. VLANs).

</t>

<t> Based on NVO3 framework and problem statement, NVO3 will deliver  16 million
virtual networks in a physical data center. If L3VPN is used to access
the virtual networks inside the data center, we need to solve the problem
of associating MPLS labels to NVO3 VNIDs.

<section title = "Big Labels">

<t>
A PE device  uses VPN labels to find the associated VRFs for VPN packet
forwarding. Since there are potentially 16 millions of virtual networks,
20 bits label are not sufficient; we need to specify a new type of labels:
big labels. A big label is an extension to the MPLS label format of RFC 3032
so that the label space is bigger than the 20-bit space with the minimum of
 16 millions of labels.
</t>

<t>
The exact big label format is described in [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-big-label].
One option of the big label format is as follows:


<figure>

<artwork>
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|            Big Label Indicator        | Exp |S|       TTL     |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|            Big Label Value                                    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Exp:    Experimental Use, 3 bits
                    S:      Bottom of Stack, 1 bit
                    TTL:    Time to Live, 8 bits
</artwork>
</figure>

The Big Label Indicator is a reserved MPLS label. The currently unassigned
reserved label
range is 4-6 and 8-12. We will temporarily use label 8 for big label indicator,
but the final value will be assigned by IANA. The Big Label Value is a 32-bit
value.
</t>

<t>
When an MPLS LSR receivs an MPLS packet, it reads out the MPLS label. If the
MPLS label is a Big Label Indicator, it will use the subsequent 32-bit value
as the MPLS label for the forwarding purpose.
</t>

<section title = "VRFs">

<t> In BGP/MPLS L3VPN models, A VRF on each PE is associated to a local attachment
circuit connected to a customer site and routing targets connected to remote
sites. When BGP/MPLS L3VPN model is extended to connect a virtulized network,
A VRF on each PE-NVE device is associated to a virtual network  instance
which is
 significant locally to the virtualized networks in the data center.

<t> Except for big labels being used, there are no changes to VRFs. In
particular, the operational procedure is the same as common label-based VRFs.

<section title = "VPN Route Distribution">

<t>
VPN route distribution is performed by BGP in the same way as in RFC 2547 except
that the labels associated to VRFs are "big labels". The
detailed changes to BGP protocols
are described in [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-bgp-big-label].

<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
<t>  The requirements on IANA are specified in other related documents
[I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-big-label] and [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-bgp-big-label],
which request a reserved label to represent Big Label Indicator and BGP
capabilities for big labels.

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>
This draft does not add any additional security implications to the BGP/MPLS
IP VPNs. All existing authentication and security mechanisms for BGP and MPLS
still apply.
