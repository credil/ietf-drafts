Internet-Draft           vCard KIND:application                July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Version 4 of the vCard specification [VCARD] defines a new "KIND"
   property to specify the type of entity that a vCard represents.
   During its work on the base vCard4 specification, the VCARDDAV
   Working Group defined values of "individual", "organization",
   "group", and "location" for the KIND property.  The working group
   considered but then removed a value of "thing" to represent any type
   of physical entity, machine, software application, etc., with the
   expectation that such a value might be defined in a vCard extension.
   This document does not define a generic "thing" value, but instead
   defines a more narrow "application" value so that vCards can be used
   to represent software applications.


2.  Meaning

   When the KIND property has a value of "application", the vCard
   represents a software application such as a server, an online service
   (e.g., a chatroom), or an automated software bot.  More formally, an
   "application" is functionally equivalent to the 'applicationProcess'
   object class used in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   [RFC4519] as derived from the Open Systems Interconnection model
   [X.521] and [X.200].  As one example of the "application" KIND,
   vCards are currently used in the Extensible Messaging and Presence
   Protocol [RFC6120] to represent instant messaging servers that are
   deployed on the network.

   The properties included in an application's vCard apply to one of the
   following:

   o  The application itself (e.g., the FN property might represent the
      friendly name of an application service, the URL property might
      represent a website that contains further information about the
      service, and the ADR, GEO, and TZ properties might represent the
      physical address, geographical location, and timezone of the
      machine where the service is hosted).

   o  An organization or person that makes the application available on
      the network (e.g., the LOGO property might represent the corporate
      logo of a service provider).

   o  A person or role that maintains the application (e.g., the TEL,
      EMAIL, and IMPP properties might represent ways to contact a
      server administrator).

   When a property represents some aspect of the application itself, it
   makes no sense to include the "work" and "home" values of the TYPE

   parameter since software applications do not have work places and
   personal lives (see the definition of the TYPE parameter in Section
   5.6 of [VCARD]).  When a property represents information about an
   individual associated with the application (e.g., an individual
   service administrator as opposed to a generic service administrator
   role or an associated organization), inclusion of the "work" and
   "home" values can be appropriate.

   The following base properties make sense for vCards that represent
   software applications (this list is not exhaustive, and other
   properties might be applicable as well):

   o  ADR
   o  EMAIL
   o  FN
   o  GEO
   o  IMPP
   o  KEY
   o  KIND
   o  LANG
   o  LOGO
   o  NOTE
   o  ORG
   o  PHOTO
   o  REV
   o  SOURCE
   o  TEL
   o  TZ
   o  URL

   Although it might be desirable to define a more fine-grained taxonomy
   of applications (e.g., a KIND of "application" with a subtype of
   "server" or "IM server"), such a taxonomy is out of scope for this
   document.


3.  Example

   The following example of an XMPP server is borrowed from [XEP-0292]
   and uses the XML representation of vCard described in [VCARDXML].

   </vcard>


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add "application" to the registry of
   property values for vCard4.  In conformance with Section 10.2.6 of
   [VCARD], the registration is as follows, where the reference is to
   RFCXXXX.

   Value:  application
   Purpose:  The entity represented by the vCard is a software
      application (e.g., a server, an online service such as a chatroom,
      or an automated software bot).
   Conformance:  This value can be used with the "KIND" property.
   Example:  See Section 3 of RFCXXXX.

   [[NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please change XXXX to the number assigned to
   this specification, and remove this paragraph on publication.]]


5.  Security Considerations

   Use of vCards to represent software applications is not envisioned to
   introduce security considerations beyond those specified for vCards
   in general as described in [VCARD].


6.  Acknowledgements
