Multipoint LDP in-band signaling for Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-
                   to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths
               draft-ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling-07

Abstract

   Consider an IP multicast tree, constructed by Protocol Independent
   Multicast (PIM), needs to pass through an MPLS domain in which
   Multipoint LDP (mLDP) Point-to-Multipoint and/or Multipoint-to-
   Multipoint Labels Switched Paths (LSPs) can be created.  The part of
   the IP multicast tree that traverses the MPLS domain can be
   instantiated as a multipoint LSP.  When a PIM Join message is
   received at the border of the MPLS domain, information from that
   message is encoded into mLDP messages.  When the mLDP messages reach
   the border of the next IP domain, the encoded information is used to
   generate PIM messages that can be sent through the IP domain.  The
   result is an IP multicast tree consisting of a set of IP multicast
   sub-trees that are spliced together with a multipoint LSP.  This
   document describes procedures how IP multicast trees are spliced
   together with multipoint LSPs.

Internet-Draft         In-band signaling with mLDP          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The mLDP (Multipoint LDP) [RFC6388] specification describes
   mechanisms for creating point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-
   multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs (Label Switched Paths).  These LSPs are
   typically used for transporting end-user multicast packets.  However,
   the mLDP specification does not provide any rules for associating
   particular end-user multicast packets with any particular LSP.  Other
   documents, like [RFC6513], describe applications in which out-of-band
   signaling protocols, such as PIM and BGP, are used to establish the
   mapping between an LSP and the multicast packets that need to be
   forwarded over the LSP.

   This document describes an application in which the information
   needed to establish the mapping between an LSP and the set of
   multicast packets to be forwarded over it is carried in the "opaque
   value" field of an mLDP FEC (Forwarding Equivalence Class) element.
   When an IP multicast tree (either a source-specific tree or a
   bidirectional tree) enters the MPLS network the (S,G) or (*,G)
   information from the IP multicast control plane state is carried in
   the opaque value field of the mLDP FEC message.  As the tree leaves
   the MPLS network, this information is extracted from the FEC element
   and used to build the IP multicast control plane.  PIM messages can
   be sent outside the MPLS domain.  Note that although the PIM control
   messages are sent periodically, the mLDP messages are not.

   Each IP multicast tree is mapped one-to-one to a P2MP or MP2MP LSP in
   the MPLS network.  A network operator should expect to see as many
   LSPs in the MPLS network as there are IP multicast trees.  A network
   operator should be aware how IP multicast state is created in the
   network to ensure it does not exceed the scalability numbers of the
   protocol, either PIM or mLDP.

   Consider the following topology;

      |--- IPM ---|--- MPLS --|--- IPM ---|

   S/RP -- (A) - (U) - (C) - (D) -- (B) -- R

   Figure 1.

   Nodes A and B are IP Multicast capable routers and respectively
   connect to a Source/RP and a Receiver.  Nodes U, C and D are MPLS
   Label Switched Routers (LSRs).

   Label Switched Router D is attached to a network that is capable of
   MPLS multicast and IP multicast (see figure 1), and D is required to
   create a IP multicast tree due to a certain IP multicast event, like
   a PIM Join, MSDP Source Announcement (SA) [RFC3618], BGP Source
   Active auto-discovery route [I-D.rekhter-pim-sm-over-mldp] or
   Rendezvous Point (RP) discovery.  Suppose that D can determine that
   the IP multicast tree needs to travel through the MPLS network until
   it reaches LSR U. For instance, when D looks up the route to the
   Source or RP [RFC4601] of the IP multicast tree, it may discover that
   the route is a BGP route with U as the BGP next hop.  Then D may
   chose to set up a P2MP or MP2MP LSP, with U as root, and to make that
   LSP become part of the IP multicast distribution tree.  Note that
   other methods are possible to determine that an IP multicast tree is
   to be transported across an MPLS network using P2MP or MP2MP LSPs,
   these methods are outside the scope of this document.

   In order to establish a multicast tree via a P2MP or MP2MP LSP using
   "in-band signaling", LSR D encodes a P2MP or MP2MP FEC Element, with
   the IP address of LSR U as the "Root Node Address", and with the
   source and the group encoded into the "opaque value" ([RFC6388],
   section 2.2 and 3.2).  Several different opaque value types are
   defined in this document; LSR D MUST NOT use a particlar opaque value
   type unless it knows (through provisioning, or through some other
   means outside the scope of this document) that LSR U supports the
   root node procedures for that opaque value type.

   The particular type of FEC Element and opaque value used depends on
   the IP address family being used, and on whether the multicast tree
   being established is a source specific or a bidirectional multicast
   tree.

   When an LSR receives a label mapping or withdraw whose FEC Element
   contains one of the opaque value types defined in this document, and
   that LSR is not the one identified by the "Root Node Address" field
   of that FEC element, the LSR follows the procedures of RFC 6388.

   When an LSR receives a label mapping or withdraw whose FEC Element
   contains one of the opaque value types defined in this document, and

Internet-Draft         In-band signaling with mLDP          October 2012


   that LSR is the one identified by the "Root Node Address" field of
   that FEC element, then the following procedure is executed.  The
   multicast source and group are extracted and passed to the multicast
   code.  If a label mapping is being processed, the multicast code will
   add the downstream LDP neighbor to the olist of the corresponding
   (S,G) or (*,G) state, creating such state if it does not already
   exist.  If a label withdraw is being processed, the multicast code
   will remove the downstream LDP neighbor from the olist of the
   corresponding (S,G) or (*,G) state.  From this point on normal PIM
   processing will occur.

   Note that if the LSR identified by the "Root Node Address" field does
   not recognize the opaque value type, the MP LSP will be established,
   but the root node will not send any multicast data packets on it.

   Source or RP addresses that are reachable in a VPN context are
   outside the scope of this document.

   Multicast groups that operate in PIM Dense-Mode are outside the scope
   of this document.

2.1.  Transiting Unidirectional IP multicast Shared Trees

   Nothing prevents PIM shared trees, used by PIM-SM in the ASM service
   model, from being transported across a MPLS core.  However, it is not
   possible to prune individual sources from the shared tree without the
   use of an additional out-of-band signaling protocol, like PIM or BGP
   [I-D.rekhter-pim-sm-over-mldp].  For that reason transiting Shared
   Trees across a Transit LSP is outside the scope of this document.

2.2.  Transiting IP multicast source trees

   IP multicast source trees can either be created via PIM operating in
   SSM mode [RFC4607] or ASM mode [RFC4601].  When PIM-SM is used in ASM
   mode, the usual means of discovering active sources is to join a
   sparse mode shared tree.  However, this document does not provide any
   method of establishing a sparse mode shared tree across an MPLS
   network.  To apply the technique of this document to PIM-SM in ASM
   mode, there must be some other means of discovering the active
   sources.  One possible means is the use of MSDP [RFC3618].  Another
   possible means is to use BGP Source Active auto-discovery routes, as
   documented in [I-D.rekhter-pim-sm-over-mldp].  However, the method of
   discovering the active sources is outside the scope of this document,
   and as a result this document does not specify everything that is
   needed to support the ASM service model using in-band signaling.

   The source and group addresses are encoded into the a transit TLV as
   specified in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2.

Internet-Draft         In-band signaling with mLDP          October 2012


2.3.  Transiting IP multicast bidirectional trees

   If a Bidirectional IP multicast trees [RFC5015] has to be transported
   over a MPLS network using in-band signaling, as described in this
   document, it MUST be transported using a MP2MP LSPs.  A bidirectional
   tree does not have a specific source address; the group address,
   subnet mask and RP are relevant for multicast forwarding.  This
   document does not provide procedures to discover RP to group mappings
   dynamically across an MPLS network and assumes the RP is statically
   defined.  Support of dynamic RP mappings in combination with in-band
   signaling is outside the scope of his document.

   The RP for the group is used to select the ingress LSR and root of
   the LSP.  The group address is encoded according to the rules of
   Section 3.3 or Section 3.4, depending on the IP version.  The subnet
   mask associated with the bidirectional group is encoded in the
   Transit TLV.  There are two types of bidirectional states in IP
   multicast, the group specific state and the RP state.  The first type
   is typically created due to receiving a PIM join and has a subnet
   mask of 32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6.  The latter is typically
   created via the static RP mapping and has a variable subnet mask.
   The RP state is used to build a tree to the RP and used for sender
   only branches.  Each state (group specific and RP state) will result
   in a separate MP2MP LSP.  The merging of the two MP2MP LSPs will be
   done by PIM on the root LSR.  No speccial procedures are nessesary
   for PIM to merge the two LSPs, each LSP is effectively treated as a
   PIM enabled interface.  Please see [RFC5015] for more details.

   For transporting the packets of a sender only branch we create a
   MP2MP LSP.  Other sender only branches will receive these packets and
   will not forward them because there are no receivers.  These packets
   will be dropped.  If that affect is undesireable some other means of
   transport has to be established to forward packets to the root of the
   tree, like a Multi-Point to Point LSP for example.  A technique to
   unicast packets to the root of a P2MP or MP2MP LSP is documented in
   [I-D.rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-mspmsi] section 3.2.2.1.

   Type:  6 (to be assigned by IANA).


   Length:  33 octets


   Mask Len:  The number of contiguous one bits that are left justified
      and used as a mask, 1 octet.


   RP:  Rendezvous Point (RP) IPv6 address used for encoded group, 16
      octets.


   Group:  IPv6 multicast group address, 16 octets.


4.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for the base LDP
   specification, as described in [RFC5036].


5.  IANA considerations

   This document requires allocation from the 'LDP MP Opaque Value
   Element basic type' name space managed by IANA.  The values requested
   are:

      Transit IPv4 Source TLV type - 3

      Transit IPv6 Source TLV type - 4

      Transit IPv4 Bidir TLV type - 5

      Transit IPv6 Bidir TLV type - 6
