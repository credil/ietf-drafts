                   DHCPv6 Dynamic DNS Reconfiguration
                   draft-wing-dhc-dns-reconfigure-00

Abstract

   Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and
   IPv6-only hosts at the same time.  This makes prioritizing the DNS
   servers for hosts tricky due to a heterogeneous mix of protocol
   stacks causing optimal behavior to occur only when the host stack re-
   initializes.  The networks infrastructure is usually well equipped to
   be aware of single/dual-stack nature of hosts.

   This specification extends DHCPv6 so that the DHCPv6 Relay Agent can
   dynamically influence the priority of DNS servers provided to the
   host, so that the host can use the optimal DNS server for resolution.

1.  Introduction

   The default address selection rules [RFC6724] prefers IPv6 over IPv4.
   If a dual-stack host is configured to use a DNS64 server [RFC6147],
   that DNS64 server will synthesize a AAAA response if there is an A
   record.  Thus, the dual-stack host will always use IPv6 if a DNS
   lookup was involved, even if IPv4 could have been used more
   optimally.  If NAT44 and NAT64 [RFC6146] are deployed on the same
   network, it is preferable to use NAT44 over NAT64 for various reasons
   such as application incompatibility issues (e.g., FTP) [RFC6384] or
   for NAT dimensioning considerations.  At the same time, native IPv6
   can still be preferred over IPv4.

   The DHCPv6 Relay Agent can observe host characteristics on a network
   to determine if the host is IPv4-only, dual-stack or IPv6-only and
   also determine transitions from single to dual-stack or vice-versa.
   The DHCPv6 Relay Agent can also be controlled by an external entity
   (e.g., RADIUS server) about the connectivity type of a given
   connected host.  This document proposes a specification that allows
   the DHCPv6 Relay Agent to influence the DHCPv6 Server to send
   appropriately prioritized DNS Servers to the client as per host
   characteristics.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   DNS64 server denotes a DNS server using an IPv6 address and
   synthesizes AAAA records from A records [RFC6147]

3.  Mechanism

   This document describes a new DHCPv6 Option that can be used along
   with the DHCPv6 RECONFIGURE_REQUEST
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-triggered-reconfigure] by the DHCPv6 Relay Agent to
   indicate to the DHCPv6 Server the priority of DNS servers to be
   provided to the specified host.  The DHCPv6 Server then sends a
   Reconfigure message to the host providing updated/re-ordered DNS
   server list as suggested by the Relay Agent.  The idea is for the
   DHCPv6 Relay Agent to dynamically send the Reconfigure message based
   on host characteristics.

   1.  IPv6-only transition to dual-stack: In case a host is IPv6-only
       to start off, it is provided with a DNS64 Server.  When
       transitioning to dual-stack, an IPv4 DNS Server is assigned as a
       consequence of obtaining an IPv4 Address.  The DHCPv6 Relay Agent
       can detect this and send a RECONFIGURE_REQUEST message to the
       DHCPv6 Server indicating that the host needs to be provided with
       a regular DNS Server followed by DNS64 server.  In lieu of this
       mechanism, the host would continue to use the DNS64 server until
       the host stack re-initializes.

   2.  Dual-stack to IPv6-only: In case a host is dual-stack, it is
       provided with a regular DNS server followed by DNS64 server.
       When transitioning to IPv6-only, the DHCPv6 Relay Agent can
       detect this and send a RECONFIGURE_REQUEST message to the DHCPv6
       Server indicating that the host needs to be assigned a DNS64
       server only.  Without this, the host will continue to use the
       regular DNS Server which is inaccessible and eventually time out
       to fail over to the DNS64 Server.  This means that the host will
       take additional time to fully initialize causing delays in
       connection.

   3.  Dual-stack to IPv4-only: In case a host is dual-stack, it is
       provided with a regular DNS server followed by DNS64 server.
       When transitioning to IPv4-only, no change is required because
       the host continues to use regular DNS server.

4.  DNS_RECONFIG option

   The DNS_RECONFIG option is to be used only in a RECONFIGURE_REQUEST
   message and identifies the query being performed.  The option
   includes a flag that determines the DNS server list to be provided by
   the DHCPv6 server to the respective client.

   The option is defined below:

    0                   1                   2                     3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  OPTION_DNS_RECONFIG          | option-len                    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Info-flags |              Reserved1                        |
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

              Figure 1: DNS Reconfigure option message format

   Info-flag values are defined below -

   +------+--------------------------------
   |Value | Name                          |
   +------+--------------------------------
   | 0x01 | IPV6_DNS64_SERV_ONLY          |
   | 0x02 | IPV6_HIG_PROI_NORM_SERV       |
   +------+--------------------------------

                        Figure 2: Info-flag values

   IPV6_DNS64_SERV_ONLY:  Provide only DNS64 address list to the client.

   IPV6_DNS64_SERV_ONLY:  Provide DNS address list in this order to the
      client - first regular DNS servers, second DNS64 servers.

5.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behaviour

   DHCPv6 relay agents that implement this specification MUST be
   configurable for sending the RECONFIGURE_REQUEST message.  The Relay
   Agent MUST set the "msg-type" field to RECONFIGURE_REQUEST.  The
   Relay Agent detects host characteristics using mechanisms discussed
   in Section 7.  For host transition from IPv6-only to dual-Stack or
   IPv4-only to dual-stack Relay Agent will set Info-flags with
   IPV6_HIG_PROI_NORM_SERV and for host transition from dual-stack to
   IPv6 only Relay-Agent will set Info-flags with IPV6_DNS64_SERV_ONLY.

   The content of OPTION_DNS_RECONFIG MAY also be tweaked by an external
   entity.

6.  DHCPv6 Server Behaviour

   Upon receiving RECONFIGURE_REQUEST message containing the
   DNS_RECONFIG Option, the DHCPv6 server processing is described below
   depending on the Info-flag values:

   o  IPV6_DNS64_SERV_ONLY: The DHCPv6 server will select only IPv6
      addresses list of DNS64 recursive name servers to be sent to the
      client.  The DHCPv6 server would send Reconfigure message to
      inform the client that the server has updated configuration
      information and then the client would initiate Information-request
      /replay transaction with the server.  The updated configuration
      will now be sent as part of Information-request reply by the
      DHCPv6 server.

   o  IPV6_HIG_PROI_NORM_SERV: The DHCPv6 server will select DNS servers
      in this order, first is the regular DNS servers and the second is
      the DNS64 servers.  The DHCPv6 server would send Reconfigure
      message to the client to inform the client that the server has
      updated configuration information and then the client would
      initiate Information-request/replay transaction with the server.
      The updated configuration will now be sent as part of Information-
      request reply by the DHCPv6 server.  The order of DNS servers
      provided by option OPTION_DNS_SERVERS determines the preference
      for use by the DNS client resolver [RFC3646] thus ensuring higher
      priority for regular DNS server list followed by DNS64 servers.

   DHCPv6 server will follow the mechanism described
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-triggered-reconfigure] to create and send Reconfigure
   message.

7.  Host Tracking

   Relay Agents can actively keep track of all IPv4/IPv6 addresses and
   associated lease times assigned to hosts via the respective DHCP
   servers.  This enables Relay Agents to detect transitions from single
   to dual-stack and vice-versa efficiently.  In addition to this
   technique, which is to be primarily used, transitions can also be
   detected using snooping mechanisms.  Network devices today use
   mechanisms such as ARP and NDP snooping to determine host
   characteristics such as IPv4/IPv6 - MAC bindings.  IPv4/IPv6 and MAC
   counters are also used to determine host liveliness.  These
   mechanisms help determine if a particular IP is inactive.  Relay
   Agents can leverage these to potentially detect IP address inactivity
   to determine if a particular host has reverted to using a single
   stack even though it initially had dual-stack capabilities.
   Similarly, it can also detect active dual-stack usage after long
   periods of single-stack activity.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations described in
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-triggered-reconfigure]are applicable to this mechanism.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign new option codes for OPTION_DNS_RECONFIG
   from the option-code space as defined in section "DHCPv6 Options" of
   [RFC3315].
