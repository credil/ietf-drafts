Abstract 

   This document discusses solutions for inter-connection of BGP MPLS
   IP/VPN [RFC4364] and Data Center (DC) overlay networks. Two
   categories of inter-connections are discussed in this document. In
   the first category, Data Center overlay virtual network is built with
   BGP IP VPN technologies, the inter-connection of IP VPN in the Data
   Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN enables end-to-end IP VPN
   connectivity. New Inter-AS solutions are required in certain
   scenarios, in addition to the existing Inter-AS Options (A, B, C)
   defined in [RFC4364]. In the second category, Data Centers overlay
   network uses non IP VPN technologies, the inter-connection of any
   overlay virtual network in the Data Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN
   provides end user connectivity through stitching of different overlay
   technologies, the mapping of non IP VPN overlay to IP VPN need to be
   performed at the border Gateway of the two networks. The role of
   Software Defined Network (SDN) to assist the inter-connections is
   discussed.

1  Introduction

   BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (IP VPNs) [RFC4364] has been the
   most extensively deployed, and the most scalable Service Provider
   (SP) provisioned VPN solutions over the past decade. This document is
   centered around inter-connecting various Clouds/Data Centers to the
   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.

   With the growth of cloud services, the needs for inter-connecting
   Data Centers and Enterprise BGP/MPLS IP VPNs in the Wide Area Network
   (WAN) become important. The interests are from multiple players:
   Service Providers who provide BGP/MPLS IP VPNs and may provide cloud
   service as well; cloud providers who provide cloud services but do
   not provide BGP/MPLS IP VPNs in the WAN; and the Enterprise users who
   use both BGP/MPLS IP VPNs services and cloud services. 

   This document discusses use cases of the inter-connection of BGP/MPLS
   VPN to Data Centers, the general requirements, and the proposed
   solutions for the inter-connections.

2. Use Cases

2.1 Case 1: End-to-end BGP IP VPN cloud inter-connection

   Many Service Providers have large deployment base of BGP/MPLS IP
   VPNs. They are interested in extending the same style IP VPN
   capabilities into their Data Centers to provide end-to-end native BGP
   IP VPN services to their enterprise customers. The advantage is BGP
   IP VPN provides better security, richer policy control and QoS
   support when comparing with transport through the public Internet.
   The technologies developed to extend IP VPN into Data Center servers
   or ToR are described is virtual Provider Edge (vPE) [I-D.fang-l3vpn-
   virtual-pe],[I-D.ietf-l3vpn-end-system]. Regardless if the WAN and DC
   are managed by the same administrative domain or not (other the
   former), inter-connecting the two VPN segments are needed. 

   The interested parties are Service Providers and Enterprises.

2.2 Case 2: Hybrid cloud inter-connection

   Service Providers are interested in extending their cloud VPNs to
   provide opportunities for enterprise customers using the new services
   provided by other cloud providers. The cloud providers are interested
   to extend their customer base through the SP Enterprise IP VPN
   customers. The inter-connection between the SP BGP/MPLS IP VPNs and
   the cloud provider networks is needed to accomplished the goal. The
   inter-connection of different types of providers most likely not
   BGP/MPLS IP VPN inter-connections, as the cloud providers may use any
   type of technologies in their networks, virtualized or non-
   virtualized. The two inter-connecting networks are under the
   administrative domains of different commercial entities. The task can
   be more challenging than IP/MPLS IP VPN Inter-provider connections
   which had always been challenging not from technology point of view.

   We now add the dimension to inter-connecting VPN to various different
   technologies.


3. Architecture reference models

   The architecture reference models described below are focusing on the
   inter-connection aspects. The intra DC implementation is not in
   discussion, but the intra DC technology has the direct impact to
   Inter-DC connection. Therefore, various models are illustrated.

3.1 BGP/MPLS IP VPN Inter-AS model 

   The BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are implemented in both the WAN network and the
   Data Center. A customer VPN, for example VPNA in figure 1, consists
   of enterprise remote sites and VMs supporting applications in the
   Data Center. The IP VPN implementation is using vPE technology. The
   two segment of the VPNs are inter-connected through ASBRs facing each
   other in the respective networks.

3.2 BGP/MPLS IP VPN Gateway PE to DC vCE Model

   A simple virtual CE (vCE) [I-D.fang-l3vpn-virtual-ce] model can be
   used to inter-connect client containers to the DC Gateway which
   function as PE. This model are used SPs to provide managed services,
   when scale can meet the service requirement.

3.3 Hybrid inter-connection model                       

   The BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are implemented in the WAN network, and non
   BGP/MPLS IP VPN Overlay in DC. The connection of the two networks are
   outside of the technologies for Inter-AS connections for BGP IP VPNs.
   This model include many variations depending on the specific
   technologies used in the DC overlay. Figure 4 provides a general view
   of this inter-connecting model with ASBR on the MPLS WAN side, and
   the DC GW on the DC side. It is also viable to use one shared ASBR/GW
   for the inter-connection, especially if the WAN and the DC belong to
   the same provider.

4. Inter-connect IP VPN between DC and WAN
4.1 Existing Inter-AS options and DCI gap analysis

   The inter-AS options described in [RFC4364] can be used for DC inter-
   connection. Option A, B, and C must be supported.

4.1.1 Option A pros and cons

   In Option A: back-to-back VRF. The PE-ASBR in one AS performs MPLS or
   IP VPN decapsulation and transmits packets to the peer PE-ASBR in the
   adjacent autonomous system. The peer PE-ASBR performs MPLS or IP VPN
   encapsulation on the customer IPv4/IPv6 packets received, and
   transmits the packet through the IPv4 backbone of the autonomous
   system. VPN service providers exchange routes across a back-to-back
   VRF connection. Each VRF instance represents a separate VPN client,

   and it is configured on a separate PE-ASBR interface, allowing a PE-
   ASBR to communicate with its peer PE-ASBR as if the peer was a CE
   router.

   Pros: It is the most secure option among options A, B, and C. And it
   is the simplest model from operation perspective. Each PE-ASBR is
   treating the other as a CE.

   Cons: Scaling limitation, because per Inter-AS VPN VRF and interface
   are needed on the PE-ASBR. 

   Option A has been used in Inter-Provider inter-connections because
   the security consideration and clear operational demarcation. 

   DCI considerationa: It is a simple way to connect DC and WAN if both
   sides are small scale. Scale will be the major concern for DC inter-
   connect if large scale support is needed. Even if the DC scale is
   small, there are major concerns on receiving relevant routes
   (potentially large number) from the WAN side.

4.1.2 Option B pros and cons

   In Option B: EBGP redistribution of labeled VPN-IPv4/IPv6 routes
   between the neighboring ASes. ASes exchange VPN routing information
   (routes and labels) to establish connections. To control connections
   between autonomous systems, the PE routers and EBGP border edge
   routers maintain a label forwarding information base (LFIB). The LFIB
   manages the labels and routes that the PE routers and EBGP border
   edge routers receive during the exchange of VPN information.  The
   autonomous systems use the following guidelines to exchange VPN
   routing information: Routing information: The destination network,
   the next hop field associated with the distributing router, a local
   MPLS label; An RD: route distinguisher; ASBRs are configured to
   change the next hop (next-hop-self) when sending VPN-IPv4 NLRIs to
   the IBGP neighbors, the ASBRs must allocate a new label when they
   forward the NLRI to the IBGP neighbors. 

   Pros: It provides better scale than option A does, as it removes the
   needs of per Inter-AS VPN VRF and interface on the ASBR. 

   Cons: vanilla version of Option B is considered less secure in
   comparison with Option A, due to dynamic routing information exchange
   is involved. The ASBR scaling may still be issues because ASBR must
   maintain all VPN routes.

   Option B is commonly used within single provider or for inter-
   provider connections.

INTERNET DRAFT              <BGP IP VPN DCI>         <February 25, 2013>


   DCI consideration: Option B is one viable option to be used in DC
   inter-connection. But it has the same scale concerns as other options
   on potential large number of routes exchange between WAN and DC.

4.1.3 Option C pros and cons

   In option C: Multihop eBGP Redistribution of Labeled VPN-IPv4 Routes
   Between Source and Destination ASs, with eBGP Redistribution of
   Labeled IPv4 Routes from AS to Neighboring AS. The ASBRs need only to
   exchange host routes (/32 or /128) to the PE routers involved in the
   VPN, with the labels needed to get there. A Label Switch Path (LSP)
   is built from the ingress PE router in one AS to the egress PE in the
   other AS (using loopback addresses). VPN traffic uses this LSP to
   reach the other AS. From data plane is perspective, the ASBRs act as
   P routers, with no knowledge about the VPNs concerned. Between ASBRs
   the VPN traffic looks like traffic between P routers: each data
   packet is pre-pended with the VPN label and then with an egress-PE
   label. Option C can be further scaled by using route reflectors (RRs)
   in each AS.  

   Pros:It is the most scalable option among all. ASBR is no longer a
   bottle neck for VPN routes scaling as in Option B.

   Cons: Major security issues as IGP reachability need to be exchanged
   between the neighboring ASes. 

   Option C has seen used within a single SP for inter-AS connections.
   Using RR for VPN routes exchange is the common approach. 

   DCI consideration: Option C should not be used for any DCI which is
   between two different providers. In addition, even though ASBR is off
   the burden of scaling VPN routes, VRFs, VPN interfaces. The VPN
   routes are still exchanged between the two ASes. 

4.1.4 Use of RTC

   RT constraint [RFC4684] function must be used to only distribute the
   IP VPN routes of a VPN from one AS to another under the condition
   that they both support that VPN in each of the AS. This is one most
   important function for scaling the solution. 

   But all IP VPN routes are exchanged between the two ASes (e.g. WAN
   and DC) as long as they have support the same VPNs. The potential IP
   VPN routes distribution can still be very substantial in large WAN
   and DC deployment.

4.2 Additional work discussion

   Focus is very large scale DCI. To be added.

5. Inter-connect IP VPN and non-IP VPN overlay networks

   As one significant instance of the hybrid use-case described in
   section 2.2, a DC may support a multi-tenant virtualized service
   network using IP based DC overlay encapsulations such as VXLAN [I-
   D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan] or NVGRE [I-D.sridharan-
   virtualization-nvgre]. Different deployment models may be used within
   the DC depending on the DC provider's functional and operational
   requirements.

   When an IP DC overlay is terminated at the DC gGateway router and
   traffic directed into an MPLS IP VPN. The DC Gateway router performs
   MPLS encapsulation towards the WAN and IP overlay based forwarding
   within the DC.

   In this case, the inter-connection mechanisms between the DC and the
   WAN may fall into two categories:

   1. VRF Termination

   The overlay based virtual network terminates into a BGP IP VPN VRF at
   the DC-WAN Gateway router. Both the internal routes of the DC as well
   as the external routes received from the WAN router can be installed
   in the VRF forwarding table at the DC gateway router. The DC gateway
   will perform an IP lookup and forward traffic after doing the
   appropriate MPLS or IP encapsulation.

   The DC gateway router will peer with the WAN router using one of the
   existing inter-AS mechanisms described above. The DC Gateway
   functions as an IP-VPN ASBR with local VRFs, for example packets
   still undergo an IP forwarding lookup.

   2. DC-VN and IP VPN Inter-working

   In this case, the DC Gateway router performs a direct translation
   between VN-IDs and IP VPN labels while switching packets between the
   DC and WAN interfaces without performing an IP lookup. The forwarding
   table at the DC Gateway router is set up to do a VN-ID or label
   lookup and derive the output label or VN-ID. The DC Gateway Router
   acts as an Inter-AS Option B ASBR peering with other ASBRs.
