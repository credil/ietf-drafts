    Abstract 

       This draft proposes a Hierarchical Mobility Management (HMM) in 
       Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) networks. The Internet is 
       divided into a number of mapping domains (MDs). An Agent Tunnel 
       Router (ATR) as an agent of each MD manages the Mobile Node's EID-to-
       RLOC mapping. For the movement within the MD, the ATR keeps the EID-
       to-RLOC mapping invariable, so it avoids the mapping update in the 
       mapping system and the Tunnel Router (TR) of each correspondent node. 
       For the handover between different MDs, to support fast update and 
       handover, a united mapping table is proposed in the ATR.

    1. Introduction 

       In the current TCP/IP stack, IP address is overloaded with the 
       semantics of both host identifiers and locators [RFC 4984]. From the 
       application layer of view, IP address identifies a host and it is 
       used in the application and transport layer. From the network layer

       of view, IP address indicates the current topological location of a 
       host. The dual roles of IP address make it difficult to support 
       mobility. When a host moves into a new subnet, it must configure a 
       new IP address. As the transport layer connection identifier includes 
       IP address, the host has to re-establish connections. Thus, to keep 
       connections alive, we need to decouple the dual roles of IP address.  

       We propose a novel mobility management based on the LISP networks 
       [LISP]. A mapping system as a separate logical management plane 
       controls the MN's EID-to-RLOC mapping so as to offer good 
       manageability. In addition, the ATR as an indirection point takes 
       charge of mapping EIDs to RLOCs which can hide the MN and network 
       equipment's location and achieve location privacy. In addition, this 
       is a network-based mobility management protocol, which does not 
       require MNs to participate in any mobility-related signaling, so it 
       avoids a few signaling cost in wireless links.  

       Due to the introduction of identifier/locator separation, a critical 
       challenge is how to keep the mapping between the MN's identifier and 
       its dynamically changing IP address [Mapping, SMGI]. This implies 
       that the mapping system and the TR of each correspondent node (CN) 
       need to update the EID-to-RLOC mapping when the MN moves. To reduce 
       the update signaling cost, we distinguish micro-mobility and macro-
       mobility by introducing an ATR in each mapping domain. For micro-
       mobility, the ATR as a special TR keeps the MN's identifier-to-
       locator mapping invariable and does not need to update the mapping in 
       the mapping system and the TR of each CN. To perform the fast mapping 
       update in the case of macro-mobility, we design a united mapping 
       table in the ATR. It contains mapping information of each CN which 
       the MN is communicating with so that the old ATR can directly inform 
       the new ATR mapping entries of CNs. In this way, the new ATR does not 
       need to query mapping servers, which eliminates the mapping request 
       delay. 

    2. Definition of items 

       Endpoint ID (EID): An EID is a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for IPv6) 
         value used in the source and destination address fields of the 
         first (most inner) LISP header of a packet. An EID is allocated to 
         a host from an EID-prefix block associated with the site where the 
         host is located. See [LISP] for details. 
        
       Routing Locator (RLOC): A RLOC is an IPv4 or IPv6 address of an 
         egress tunnel router (ETR). A RLOC is the output of an EID-to-RLOC 
         mapping lookup. An EID maps to one or more RLOCs. Typically, RLOCs

         are numbered based on the connectivity of provider networks. See 
         [LISP] for details. 
        
       EID-to-RLOC mapping: a binding between an EID or EID-prefix and a 
         RLOC set which can be used to reach the EID. The xTRs can 
         encapsulate packets with the RLOC in the EID-to-RLOC mapping to 
         reach the destination EID. A RLOC set may contain multiple RLOCs to 
         perform multihoming or traffic engineering. 
        
       Mapping Server (MS): A network infrastructure component which stores 
         the EID-to-RLOC mappings and responds to Map-Requests.  
        
       Mapping Domain (MD): The Internet is divided into a number of mapping 
         domains (MDs) and each MD consists of a MS and several xTRs.  
        
       Agent Tunnel Router(ATR): An ATR has two functionality of ITR and ETR, 
         which can encapsulate and decapsulate packets. For the movement 
         within the MD, the ATR keeps the EID-to-RLOC mapping invariable. 
         The ATR receives IP packets from TRs on one side and sends LISP-
         encapsulated IP packets toward the Internet on the other side. 
         Meanwhile, an ATR receives LISP-encapsulated IP packets from the 
         Internet on one side and sends decapsulated IP packets to TRs or 
         hosts on the other side. In addition, it sends a Map-request to the 
         mapping system when it does not have the EID-to-RLOC mapping for 
         the destination EID. 
        
       Tunnel Router(TR): A TR encapsulates packets with a tunnel header and 
         sends them to the ATR by a tunnel. 
        

    3. HMM Overview 

    3.1. The architecture of HMM 

       Figure 1 shows the network architecture of HMM, which contains two 
       hierarchies: a mapping system and the current Internet. The mapping 
       system is an overlay network on the top of Internet and consists of a 
       set of mapping servers (MS). MSs manage EID-to-RLOC mapping entries 
       and resolve Map-Request messages. There have been several proposals 
       to discuss the architecture of the mapping system [LISP-DHT] [LISP-
       TREE] [LISP+ALT].

       The Internet is divided into a number of MDs. Each MD contains 
       several TRs. Any TR may be as an agent to manage the movement of MNs 
       within its MD. The agent TR encapsulates packets with RLOCs and 
       maintains the mappings between EIDs and RLOCs. Assume the first TR 
       that an MN attaches to in the MD is the ATR. When the MN connects to 
       other TRs in the same MD, the TR will establish a tunnel with the ATR.

    3.2. Micro-Mobility 

       We divide the global internet into a number of MDs and assume each 
       autonomous system (AS) is a MD, which is managed by different 
       Internet Service Providers (ISP). When an MN moves within the same MD, 
       we define it micro-mobility. While the MN moves between different MDs, 
       we call it macro-mobility. We deal with macro-mobility and micro-
       mobility separately to minimize the signaling cost and alleviate the 
       burden of the mapping system.

       Figure 2 illustrates the message flows for the location management 
       scheme in micro-mobility scenario. First of all, an MN attaches the 
       TR1, and then the TR1 is the agent of the MN in this MD. The ATR1 
       sends a Map-Register message including the EID and RLOC of the MN to 
       the associated MS. The MS adds the mapping entry of the MN.  

       When a CN wants to communicate with the MN, it sends packets to the 
       ATR3 using its and the MN's EID as packets'source address and 
       destination address. The ATR3 will send a LISP Map-Request message to 
       the MS. The MS lookups the destination EID of the Map-Request and 
       matches it against the prefixes in the EID-to-RLOC mapping database. 
       If there is no match, the Map-Request is dropped. Otherwise, a LISP 
       Map-Reply is returned to the ATR3. The ATR3 encapsulates packets with 
       ATR3's RLOCs and ATR1's RLOCs as packets'source address and 
       destination address. When the ATR1receives these packets, it 
                                         
       decapsulates packets and then sends them to the MN. 

       When the MN moves into the TR2 coverage area with the same MD of the 
       ATR1, the TR2 only sends one Map-Update message to the ATR1. The ATR1 
       responds to the Map-Update message and establishes a tunnel with the 
       TR2. In this case, we regard the ATR1 as a local agent of the MN. As 
       long as the MN still stays in this MD, the MN's EID-to-RLOC mapping 
       does not change. All the packets from other MDs destination to the MN 
       pass through the ATR1 and then the ATR1 forwards packets to the TR2 
       by the tunnel. In this way, the mapping information in the remote 
       ATR3 and the MS need not be changed, so this scheme significantly 
       reduces signaling cost.

Message flows of the location management scheme

    3.3. Macro-Mobility 

       Macro-mobility indicates that an MN crosses different MDs. In this 
       case, the stale mapping entry in the mapping system and the TR of 
       each CN must be updated in order to help new initiators and ongoing 
       communication users acquire the correct mapping information. 

       Figure 3 shows the mobility management scheme in macro-mobility 
       scenario. Assume that the MN has performed the handover from the ATR1 
       to the TR2 as shown in Fig. 2. Then, the MN moves from the TR2 in the 
       MD1 to the TR4 in the MD2. The TR4 as an agent in the MD2 adds the         
       MN's mapping entry in its local table and then sends a Map-Register 
       message to the MS. 

       In addition, the ATR4 sends a Map-Update message to the ATR1. Then, 
       the ATR1 sends a Map-Update response message to notify mapping 
       entries of CNs to the ATR4. In this way, the ATR4 can acquire a set 
       of CNs'mapping information. It avoids sending more messages to the 
       mapping system, so this solution reduces the signaling cost. As soon 
     
     
    Zhang et al.            Expires June 10, 2013                 [Page 7] 
        
    Internet-Draft A Hierarchical Mapping System for LISP    December 2012 
        

       as the ATR4 obtains the CNs'mappings, it will directly encapsulate 
       and forward packets, so the scheme can support fast handoff. 

       After that, the ATR1 sends a message to the ATR3 in order to update 
       the new MN's mapping information in the ATR3's mapping table. Once 
       the ATR3 gets the new mapping, packets destination to the MN are 
       directly routed to the ATR4, while do not need to pass though the old 
       ATR1. Thus, the scheme can avoid triangle routing and achieve route 
       optimization. Finally, the ATR1 removes the MN's mapping entry from 
       its mapping table. 

       In addition, the ATR1 sends a delete tunnel message to the TR2 and 
       macro-mobility's operations complete.

    4. Mapping Table 

       The LISP proposes a kind of separate mapping table in the TR. The 
       mapping information of local nodes and remote nodes stores in the 
       EID-to-RLOC Database and the EID-to-RLOC Cache, respectively. The 
       local table maintains the EID-to-RLOC mappings for the EID prefixes 
       "behind" the router. The EID-to-RLOC Cache stores mapping entries of 
       CNs which local users are communicating with.  

       In this solution, the EID-to-RLOC Cache is shared by all the MNs. If 
       an MN attaches another mapping domain's TR, the mapping information 
       in the TR of each CN need be updated. However, all the MNs share the 
       same cache and the old ATR does not know which CN is communicating 
       with the MN. Thus, the old ATR can not inform the new ATR of CNs'
       mapping information. The new ATR must send mapping request messages 
       to the mapping system. It not only adds query delay but also brings 
       excess signaling cost. 

       For macro-mobility scenario, to support fast handover and reduce the 
       overload of the mapping system, we design a united mapping table in 
       the ATR integrating the mappings of local MNs with the mapping 
       entries of CNs. Figure 4 illustrates the data structure of the 
       mapping table. Each mapping entry contains a local MN and a list of 
       CNs which the local MN is communicating with. 

       When an MN attaches to another MD's TR, the old ATR lookups the 
       united mapping table to find the list of CNs of the MN. After that, 
       the old ATR sends these mappings of CNs to the new domain's ATR. In 
       this way, the new ATR can acquire mapping information quickly and 
       accurately.

                      Figure 4: The mapping table in the ATR 

       As shown in Fig. 4, the local node's mapping information in the 
       united mapping table contains six sections. "EID"is used to 
       represent the identity of an MN. "RLOC"is the IP address of the ATR 
       for locating nodes in the network topology. "Flag"indicates the 
       location of the MN. If the value of "Flag"is "LEFT", it indicates 
       that the MN has left the ATR and the ATR forwards packets by the 
       tunnel. "Tunnel source address"and "Tunnel destination address"are 
       used to establish a tunnel and encapsulate packets with the tunnel 
       header for the MN. If the value of "Flag"is "LIVE", it indicates the 
       MN still is in the MD of the ATR. The function of "Timer"is to 
       manage the MN's mapping entry. Mapping entries in the mapping table 
       will not be deleted until the value of "Timer"is zero that hints the 
       MN leaves the ATR coverage area. 

       In addition, the united mapping table in the ATR also includes a list 
       of CNs. Each CN's entry consists of "EID", "RLOC"and "Timer". "EID"
       and "RLOC"are identity and location of a CN. The ATR maintains a 
       "Timer"for each CN's mapping entry. Whenever packets pass through 
       the ATR, the timer resets to maximum. If the lifetime is expired, the 
       ATR will remove the CN's mapping entry from the mapping table.

       Figure 5 illustrates the mapping information in the TR. "EID"is the 
       identity of an MN. "Tunnel source address"and "Tunnel destination 
       address"are used to set up a tunnel. "Tunnel source address"is an 
       IP address of the TR and "Tunnel destination address"is one of the 
       ATR's addresses. "Timer"is used to send a keeplive message to the MN 
       in order to confirm that the MN still is its area. When "Timer"
       exceeds a predetermined threshold, the TR sends message to the MN. If 
       the TR receives the response message from the MN, the TR resets the 
       "Timer"to zero. Otherwise, the TR considers that the MN has been 
       left from its area. 

    5. Properties 

       In this section, we describe properties of the mobility management 
       scheme based on identifier locator split architecture. The proposed 
       scheme exhibits the following several advantages. 

       Connection Survivability: The novel scheme must allow an MN to roam 
       while keeping transport connections alive. By means of the identifier 
       locator separation scheme the current IP address is split into two 
       spaces for end-systems identifiers and routing locators.  When an MN 
       attaches a new access point, it only changes its locator.  Because 
       the identifier of the MN is constant and the locator's change is 
       transparent to the upper layer, which makes it possible to keep 
       transport connections alive. Therefore, the identifier/locator 
       separation solution can support global roaming seamless and fast 
       handover. 

       Location Privacy: In the proposed identifier/locator separation 
       scheme, if a CN wants to communicate with a MN, it uses its and MN's 
       identifier as the data packets'source and destination address. And 
       then the ATR receives the data and encapsulates them with locators. 
       The core network's routers forward the data packets to the ATR of the 
       MN according to the locator. The MN's ATR decapsulates the data 
       packets and forwards them to the TR that the MN attaches. Finally, 
       the TR sends packets to the MN. By the identifier/locator separation 
       scheme, the CN only knows MN's identifier, so the location of the MN 
       is hidden from the CN. 

       Support routing scalability: One main aim of identifier/locator 
       separation is to support routing scalability. The identifier/locator 
       separation scheme removes host's identifier entries from core routers 
       in today's routing system, without losing reachability to any 
       destinations. After packets which are sent by a host arrive at a TR, 
       they are encapsulated with the locator. Since the locator is 
       reachable in core routers, the packet can be forward to destination.

       We  design  a  novel  mobility  management  scheme  based  on  the 
       identifier/locator separation which does not damage the separation 
       architecture and can solve both global routing scalability problems 
       and mobility support. As a result, the proposed mobility management 
       scheme based on identifier/locator separation can support routing 
       scalability.
