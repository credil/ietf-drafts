             Obligations of Implementers of IETF Protocols
               <draft-housley-implementer-obligations-00>


Abstract

   By choosing to implement an IETF protocol, one accepts an obligation
   to follow the specification, associated best current practices, and
   IANA registry practices.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

1.  Introduction

   IETF protocols foster interoperability.  This interoperability brings
   great benefits.  IETF protocols are building blocks for many products
   and services, and they enable innovation. Yet, IETF standards are
   voluntary standards.  No one is required to implement them.
   Implementation is a choice.  By making this choice, implementor
   accept three obligations:

      (1) Follow the protocol specification;
      (2) Follow associated Best Current Practices (BCPs); and
      (3) Follow associated IANA registry practices.

   Following these obligations allow protocols to interoperate as
   intended by the IETF.

2.  First Obligation: Follow the Protocol Specification

   To repeat, IETF protocols foster interoperability, and this
   interoperability brings great benefits.  If one does not follow the
   protocol specification, then interoperability is jeopardized.

   Of course, one should follow Postel's Law while implementing the
   specification:

      In general, an implementation should be conservative in its
      sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior. [RFC760]

   Following Postel's Law simply increases interoperability.  One should
   be careful to send well-formed protocol data units and carefully
   follow elements of procedure; which avoids surprised for
   communicating peers that use other implementations.  On the other
   hand, one should accept any protocol data unit that can be
   interpreted, which heightens interoperability in the face of
   technical errors by others.

3.  Second Obligation: Follow Associated Best Current Practices

   Best Current Practices (BCPs) about IETF protocols (not the BCPs that
   define IETF processes and procedures) are intended to standardize
   practices.

   The Internet is composed of networks operated by a great variety of
   organizations, with diverse goals and rules.  By following the BCPs,
   implementers, operators, and administrators are able to provide a

   common experience when using the protocol, regardless of their point
   of attachment to the Internet.

4.  Third Obligation: Follow Associated IANA Registry Practices

   Many IETF protocols use of identifiers consisting of constants and
   other well-known values.  Even after a protocol has been defined and
   deployed, new values may be needed.  To ensure that such quantities
   have consistent values and interpretations across all
   implementations, assignment is administered by a central authority,
   the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  In order to manage a
   namespace (which might also be called an assigned number, an assigned
   value, a code point, a a protocol constant, or a protocol parameter)
   in support of a particular IETF protocol, IANA is given instructions
   and conditions under which new values should be assigned or when
   modifications to existing values can be made.

   Implementers are obligated to follow the IANA registry practices
   associated with the protocol, especially in the assignment of new
   values.  By following these practices, other implementations will
   learn about new values and make the appropriate updates to handle
   them properly.

   Note that IP addresses and the top levels of the DNS name hierarchy
   are managed in IANA registries [RFC2860].  Please follow the IANA
   registry practices for the assignment of special IP addresses and
   top-level DNS names in the rare cases where such values are needed.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document calls for implementers to follow the protocol
   specification, follow associated best current practices, and follow
   IANA registry practices.  These actions should greatly improve
   interoperability, and these actions may also reduce security
   incidents due to incomplete protocol implementations.

   Security processing is an exception to Postel's Law.  For example, a
   password that is close, but not exactly right, is not sufficient to
   gain access.  Processing associated with integrity, authentication,
   access control, non-repudiation, and confidentiality mechanisms
   cannot be forgiving.

6.  IANA Considerations

   {{ RFC Editor: Please remove this section prior to publication. }}

   This document has no actions for IANA.
