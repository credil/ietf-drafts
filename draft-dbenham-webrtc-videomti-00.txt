Internet-Draft             AVC for RTCweb MTI               October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This memo offers a proposal that H.264/AVC be selected as the
   mandatory-to-implement (MTI) video codec for RTCweb.  This document
   asserts that the constrained baseline profile is the likely best
   choice and uses it to make certain points.  However, the author(s)
   are open to assertions that other H.264/AVC profile(s) should be
   additionally mandated or recommended.

   This document is not intended for publication as an RFC.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119>.


3.  H.264/AVC Adoption Advantage

   H.264/AVC is widely used for enterprise videoconferencing equipment
   and services.  High-definition (HD), web videoconferencing commonly
   uses H.264/AVC as well, including Skype.

   H.264/AVC is becoming the de-facto standard for the Mobile web and
   3GPP has recommended the H.264/AVC [AVC01] codec along with the
   mandatory H.263.  Apple's iOS, Google's Android, RIM's Blackberry and
   Ericsson's mobile device platforms all support H.264/AVC.

   Web (entertainment) video is dominated by H.264/AVC, and increasingly
   "multi-screen/BYOD" video services from cable companies and telco's
   are using H.264/AVC over their private web video networks

   Thus, HTML5 browsers will likely need to have the H.264/AVC codec
   regardless to remain popular.  Internet Explorer and Safari appear to
   be including H.264/AVC in the set of codecs they ship regardless of
   the RTCweb video codec MTI decision.  And Google's Chrome continues
   shipping with H.264/AVC today.

   We assert that the lack of clearly indicating that H.264/AVC was the
   mandatory video codec for HTML5's video tag has created uncertainty
   and increased costs for those deploying sites or developing
   applications trying to cover multiple possible codecs instead.

   Mandating the H.264/AVC codec for RTCweb is in the best interest of
   rapid adoption given it is already pervasive deployed and used in
   real-time communications and web video applications.

4.  H.264/AVC has the Quality-Power-Bandwidth advantage

   First, we believe that mobile devices will be important to the
   success of RTCweb going forward.  They generally have slower CPUs
   than desktop computers and maximizing battery life is extremely
   important.

   Second, we assert that the three (3) most important factors to
   analyze in that context are a) the user experience or perceptual
   quality of the resultant video images, b) the amount of compute or
   CPU power applied to do the compression - this correlates with
   electrical power consumption, and c) the amount of bandwidth
   available or consumed.  All three factors must be considered together
   as they are interrelated.

   For a given bitrate, a codec can improve the quality by doing more
   computation, but that will drain power quicker.  While 4G/LTE brings
   more bandwidth to the equation, error properties of the medium and/or
   mobile data transmission costs will still put pressure on
   implementers to minimize bandwidth utilized by RTCweb streams.
   Throwing bandwidth at the problem is not a good assumption to improve
   quality while keeping CPU power constant.

   We quickly captured examples of leading H.264/AVC and VP8 products on
   popular mobile and desktop platforms and came to the conclusion that
   H.264 looks better than VP8 when both are run on same platform at the
   same bitrates.

   It is very hard in making tests to try and decide what parameters to
   use for codecs in a way that does not bias tests.  So instead, we
   choose the "best in class" products that we could find to demonstrate
   performance comparisons.

   The tests and resultant captures were done on a fast wireless network
   with no other traffic on the wireless network, with the exception of
   the side by side demo.  For the sides by side demo above, both
   devices were on the same WiFi network but did not seem to be having
   any losses or coming close to filling the network.  The results in
   the side by side seemed to be the same as when there were run
   independently so we do not believe that having them both on the same
   network impacted results.

   Of course, these results do not preclude implementations improving in
   the future, but this gives some idea of the current state of the art.

   Our conclusion is that H.264/AVC is best at delivering on the
   Quality-Power-Bandwidth optimization.


5.  Hardware Acceleration Advantage

   H.264/AVC has a several year head start on hardware/DSP optimization
   and is already deployed pervasively.  For handheld mobile phones,
   hardware acceleration is a must to maximize Quality-Power-Bandwidth.

   H.264/AVC hardware is already incredibly inexpensive.  Some of the
   low end consumer cameras will record H.264/AVC video, such as this
   sub-100 US dollar (<$100) Powershot A810 from Cannon. [AVC07]

6.  Well-Established IPR Status for H.264/AVC

6.1.  Disclosed and Publicly Available Lists of Patents

   As typical with many standards bodies, the joint work of ITU/MPEG
   that produced H.264/AVC has a common patent policy requiring
   disclosure by participants and third parties of any known patents or
   patent applications that may be essential to implement specifications
   in development.  These can be downloaded in spreadsheet format
   [AVC02].  The policy goes on to ask contributors to pre-agree to
   either RAND (reasonable & non-discriminatory, but may not be free) or
   royalty-free licensing of their own company's patents, with or
   without reciprocal requirements.  There is some anecdotal evidence to
   suggest US courts consider such disclosure requirements [AVC03] in
   patent lawsuit decisions.

   While all that alone doesn't guarantee 100% visibility of all
   possible essential patent claims, H.264/AVC was finished in late 2003
   and has been commercially shipping at scale for 6-7 years or more
   which should have brought to light any other patent holders
   interested in enforcing or collecting on their essential patents.

   Over 300 patents (more if counting multiple jurisdictions) covering
   mechanisms spanning several of AVC's profiles are licensed via the
   MPEG LA H.264/AVC licensing program and are publicly listed [AVC04].

   The risk of an unknown, essential patent appearing at this point
   should be comparatively low, which would be a benefit to selecting a
   H.264/AVC profile as the mandatory codec.

6.2.  Royalty Free for Innovation, Low-volume shipments

   To paraphrase, the MPEG LA license [AVC05] does allow up to 100K
   units per year, per legal entity/company (type "a" sublicensees in
   MPEG LA's definition), to be shipped for zero ($0) royalty cost.
   This should be adequate for many RTCweb innovators or start-ups to
   try out new implementations on a large set of users before incurring
   any patent royalty costs, a benefit to selecting a H.264/AVC profile
   as the mandatory codec.

6.3.  Higher H.264/AVC Profile Tools Bundled

   It should be noted that when one licenses the MPEG LA H.264/AVC pool
   [AVC04], patents for higher profile tools - such as CABAC, 8x8 - are
   bundled in with those required for the constrained baseline profile.
   Thus, these could optionally be used by RTCweb implementers to
   achieve even greater performance or efficiencies than using H.264
   constrained baseline alone, a benefit to selecting H.264/AVC and

Internet-Draft             AVC for RTCweb MTI               October 2012


   RTCweb could also go as far as recommending those higher profiles.

6.4.  Future IPR Status Consideration

   For additional informative purposes, the MPEG/IEC/ISO made a call for
   a royalty-free video coding solution for the Internet.  As of its
   98th meeting, two tracks forward are being pursued; one of which is
   based on the H.264/AVC constrained baseline profile [AVC06].  MPEG is
   presently collecting patent licensing declarations that would include
   patent holder's royalty expectations unbundled from other higher
   profile mechanisms.  Should this effort result in a royalty-free
   constrained baseline profile, this would benefit RTCweb in the future
   if H.264/AVC is selected as mandatory today.


7.  Questions about IPR Status of VP8

   For the purposes of further illustrating the benefits of the well-
   known IPR status of H.264/AVC, what follows are some comparisons to
   the unknowns that surround VP8 as of the writing of this
   contribution.  Information that resolves the open questions below is
   welcomed.

   First, Google should be commended for offering their essential
   patents on VP8 royalty-free.  However, other patent holders --
   including ones not licensees of VP8/WebM -- may exist as suggested by
   all the respondents to MPEG LA's call for a VP8 essential patent
   pool.  Also, VP8 was not developed openly in a standards body and
   thus subjected to the prescribed essential patent disclosures, etc.

   Second, others have previously advocated that the lack of lawsuits
   against shipping VP8 implementations to date means all is ok.  VP8
   has been shipping a shorter time compared to H.264/AVC and the finite
   number of companies that have shipped it to date may have, for
   example, sufficiently large patent portfolios themselves to have
   discouraged others from starting such a VP8 lawsuit against them.
   Bottom line is that it isn't a good argument that no prior lawsuits
   are an implicit indication of low risk to future patent lawsuit for
   VP8.

   Table 1: Comparison of H.264/AVC & VP8 IPR Status Impacting Features

   (*) A dozen or so companies responded to MPEG LA's call for essential
   patents on VP8, but a license for that has not been published and
   fees that may be asked for in the future is unknown.

   As suggested by Table 1, sufficient time and open, industry
   development along with the prescribed patent disclosures is
   beneficial to be more certain of the risks with shipping the chosen
   mandatory codec.

   Not having the benefit of a longer deployment duration and open,
   industry development for VP8, the following questions result;

      (a) Like MPEG/IEC/ISO, can Google list the present patents covered
      in its VP8 license (of course it is noted that any future Google
      owned essential patents are supposed to be included too)?

      (b) Does Google, or anyone else involved in any patent analysis,
      know of any third-parties with viable essential patent claims on
      VP8? c) If any in (b), are they not a concern?  Why?

      (c) If any in (b), are they not a concern?  Why?

      (d) If Google is certain there is no concern regarding (b) & (c),
      can Google provide some assurance (such as indemnification) to the
      VP8 licensees and thus indirectly assuring the RTCweb working
      group?
