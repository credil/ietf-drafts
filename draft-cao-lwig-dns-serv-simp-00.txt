               Lightweight Service Simplification via DNS
                    draft-cao-lwig-dns-serv-simp-00

Abstract

   This memo discusses a lightweight service simplification method via
   DNS.  Instead of storing the information on the Web infrastructure,
   the service provider can store them on the DNS servers.  By
   expressing these information in the DNS Resource Records, the
   requester can get these information directly during the DNS name
   resolution, without the need of accessing any web resource.  This way
   eliminates the overhead caused by TCP handshake and HTTP get/
   response, and can be served as a lightweight information provisioning
   method.

1.  Introduction

   It is normal to provide information service via Web. But in some
   scenarios where light-weight services are provided, information
   provisioning via Web is not economic.  Before accessing the first
   HTTP request , the client needs to inquiry the DNS, and finish TCP
   3-way handshake.  If the client only needs to know some simple
   information, e.g., the temperature or humidity, the overhead of
   getting these information is considerable higher.

   This memo discusses a lightweight information provision method via
   DNS.  Instead of storing the information on the Web infrastructure,
   the service provider can store them on the DNS servers.  By
   expressing these information in the DNS Resource Records, the
   requester can get these information directly during the DNS name
   resolution, without the need to accessing any web resource.  This way
   eliminates the overhead caused by TCP handshake and HTTP get/
   response, and can be served as a lightweight information provisioning
   method.

   Note: this draft contains the initial idea of light-weight service
   simplification.  The authors would improve the description and design
   considerations in later revisions.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Solution Overview

   We give a simple example in this section.  As shown in Figure 1, the
   user would like to know the temperature of a certain location,
   denoted by its FQDN "_temp.locA.example.com".  It sends a DNS query
   request to the local DNS server, the local DNS does not have the
   cached information, and will contact the authorized DNS server which
   is actually maintained by the information providers.

   There are some considerations in this mechanism.

   1.  Information expression.  How to organize the name space?  The
       provider should organize the content in a way that is compatible
       with the DNS name space.  That is, the specific information
       semantic is encoded into the FQDN.  In the example the
       temperature is denoted as _temp.*.  And the hierarchical name
       space also contains the parent domain information which is

       organized in a way that the provider organized its content on the
       server.

   2.  Information storage.  How to store the information on the DNS
       server?  DNS TXT RR [RFC1035] can be used to store the
       information.  The DNS TXT RR can be organized as TLV so that
       different types of information can be stored in the DNS servers.

   3.  Information request and response.  How the user access the
       information.  The user can use the DNS SRV [RFC2782] query to
       access the stored information on the server.  And the TXT RR will
       be returned in the response message.

   4.  Information Update.  The user could also send DNS update requests
       to the authority DNS servers.  The DNS dynamic updates [RFC2136]
       can be used for information update.

   User                     Local DNS              Authority DNS Server
    | SRV Query                  |                           |
    | _temp.locA.example.com     | recursive resolution      |
    |--------------------------->|-------------------------->|
    | Query Result               | Query Result              |
    |<---------------------------|<--------------------------|
    |                            |                           |

               Figure 1: An Example of Information Retrieval

   If the user is a sensor and would update some resource records on the
   DNS server, it should send DNS update messages per [RFC2136] to the
   authority DNS server to update the corresponding resource records.
   This process is depicted in Figure 2.

   User                     Local DNS              Authority DNS Server
    | SRV Update                 |                           |
    | _temp.locA.example.com     | recursive resolution      |
    |--------------------------->|-------------------------->|
    | Update Result              | Update Result             |
    |<---------------------------|<--------------------------|
    |                            |                           |

                Figure 2: An Exmaple of Information Update

   Note: All the above figures assumes that the local DNS has cached the
   address of the authority DNS server.  If that's not the case, the
   local DNS resolver will consult the root servers for reference.  This
   also indicates that the cache behavior the upper layer domain names
   will influence the information retrieval efficiency.

   The CoAP can also be used by the sensors to update the resource
   records on the DNS server.  In such case, the DNS server should
   implement CoAP agent.  The CoAP agent should have the rights to
   update the DNS record with some specific FQDN, for example, FQDNs
   with "_temp" prefix.


3.  DNS Considerations

   In order to use the DNS resolution process for service
   simplification, many aspects such as TTL, cache, authorized server
   placement should be considered.

   1.  The TTL of DNS resource records.  The TTL value of the DNS RR
       stands for its lifetime, and hence influences the cache behavior
       of the local DNS resolver.  For high real-time requirement
       applications, the TTL should be set to minimal value zero.  For
       time tolerant applications, the TTL could be set to values
       greater than zero.  For non-zero TTL values, the local DNS
       funtionally acts as the information cache.

   2.  The placement of the authority DNS server.  The authority DNS
       server for a certain sub-domain should be controlled by the
       information provider, such as the scenario mentioned in
       [I-D.vanderstok-core-bc].  The granularity of the sub-domain
       separation ought to be determined by the provider.  Either it
       could be an authority server controlling the *.example.com sub-
       domain, or in a denser deployement, an authority server
       controlling the *.locA.example.com.


4.  IANA Considerations

   None.


5.  Security Considerations

   The proposal in this document should be compatible with DNSSEC.
