     1. Introduction 

        The EMAN standards provide a specification for Energy 
        Management. This document defines a subset of a Management 
        Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols 
        for Energy monitoring of network devices and devices attached to 
        the network and possibly extending to devices in the industrial 
        automation setting with a network interface.  
         
        The focus of the MIB module specified in this document is on  
        the identification of Energy Objects and reporting the context 
        and relationships of  Energy Objects as defined in [EMAN-FMWK]. 
        The module addresses Energy Object Identification, Energy Object 
        Context, and Energy Object Relationships.

     1.1. Energy Management Document Overview 

        This document specifies the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module. 
        This document is based on the Energy Management Framework [EMAN-
        FMWK] and meets the requirements on identification of Energy 
        Objects and their context and relationships as specified in the 
        Energy Management requirements [EMAN-REQ]. 
                           
        A second MIB module required by the [EMAN-FMWK], the Power and 
        Energy Monitoring MIB [EMAN-MON-MIB], monitors the Energy 
        Objects for Power States, for the Power and Energy consumption.  
        Power State monitoring includes: retrieving Power States, Power 
        State properties, current Power State, Power State transitions, 
        and Power State statistics.  In addition, this MIB module 
        provides the Power Quality properties of the Power and Energy, 
        along with optional characteristics. 
         
        The applicability statement document [EMAN-AS] provides the list 
        of use cases, and describes the common aspects of between 
        existing Energy standards and the EMAN standard, and shows how 
        the EMAN framework relates to other frameworks. 
         
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant with  
        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
         
     3. Requirements and Use Cases 

         
        Firstly, to illustrate the importance of energy monitoring in 
        networks and secondly to list some of the important areas to be 
        addressed by the energy management Framework, several use cases 
        and network scenarios are presented in the EMAN applicability 
        statement document [EMAN-AS].  In addition, for each scenario, 
        the target devices for energy management, and how those devices

     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      March  2012 
      
        powered and metered are also presented.  To address the network 
        scenarios, requirements for power and energy monitoring for 
        networking devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ]. Based on the 
        requirements [EMAN-REQ], the [EMAN-FMWK] presents an solution 
        approach.  
         
        Accordingly, the scope of the MIB module in this document is in 
        accordance to the requirements specified in [EMAN-REQ] and 
        [EMAN-FMWK].  
         
         
         
     4. Terminology 

     EDITOR'S NOTE:  
        - All terms are copied over from the version 4 of the 
        [EMAN-TERMINOLOGY] draft.  The only difference in 
        definition is the Energy Management Domain, which has 
        been improved, to address one comment from Bill 
        Mielke. Hopefully, this version 4 is the final 
        version.  
        - "All" terms have been copied. Potentially, some 
        unused terms might have to be removed (example 
        Electrical Equipment". Alternatively, as this 
        document is the first standard track document in the 
        EMAN WG, it may become the reference document for the 
        terminology (instead of cutting/pasting the 
        terminology in all drafts) 
        - "Reference: herein" has not been copied over from 
        the terminology draft. 
        
     Energy Management 

       Energy Management is a set of functions for measuring, 
       modeling, planning, and optimizing networks to ensure 
       that the network elements and attached devices use 
       energy efficiently and is appropriate for the nature 
       of the application and the cost constraints of the 
       organization.  
       Reference: Adapted from [ITU-T-M-3400] 
       Example: A set of computer systems that will poll 
       electrical meters and store the readings  
       NOTES:

       1. Energy management refers to the activities, methods, 
          procedures and tools that pertain to measuring, 
          modeling, planning, controlling and optimizing the 
          use of energy in networked systems [NMF]. 
       2. Energy Management is a management domain which is 
          congruent to any of FCAPS areas of management in the 
          ISO/OSI Network Management Model [TMN]. Energy 
          Management for communication networks and attached 
          devices is a subset or part of an organization's 
          greater Energy Management Policies. 
        
     Energy Management System (EnMS) 

       An Energy Management System is a combination of 
       hardware and software used to administer a network 
       with the primarily purpose being Energy Management. 
       Reference: Adapted from [1037C] 
       Example: A single computer system that polls data from 
       devices using SNMP 
       NOTES: 
       1. An Energy Management System according to [ISO50001] 
          (ISO-EnMS) is a set of systems or procedures upon 
          which organizations can develop and implement an 
          energy policy, set targets, action plans and take 
          into account legal requirements related to energy 
          use.  An EnMS allows organizations to improve energy 
          performance and demonstrate conformity to 
          requirements, standards, and/or legal requirements.   
       2. Example ISO-EnMS:  Company A defines a set of 
          policies and procedures indicating there should 
          exist multiple computerized systems that will poll 
          energy from their meters and pricing / source data 
          from their local utility. Company A specifies that 
          their CFO should collect information and summarize 
          it quarterly to be sent to an accounting firm to 
          produce carbon accounting reporting as required by 
          their local government.  
       3. For the purposes of EMAN, the definition from 
          [1037C] is the preferred meaning of an Energy 
          Management System (EnMS).  The definition from 
          [ISO50001] can be referred to as ISO Energy 
          Management System (ISO-EnMS).

       NOTES: 
       1. typically kilowatts 
       2. Energy providers typically bill by Demand 
          measurements as well as for maximum Demand per 
          billing periods.  Power values may spike during 
          short-terms by devices, but Demand measurements 
          recognize that maximum Demand does not equal maximum 
          Power during an interval.

        that is a piece of Non-Electrical Equipment. 
         
         
     Energy Monitoring 

       Energy Monitoring is a part of Energy Management that 
       deals with collecting or reading information from 
       Energy Objects to aid in Energy Management.   
       NOTES:  
       1. This could include Energy, Power, Demand, Power 
          Quality, Context and/or Battery information. 
      
     Energy Control 

       Energy Control is a part of Energy Management that 
       deals with directing influence over Energy Objects.  
      
       NOTES:  
       1. Typically in order to optimize or ensure its 
          efficiency. 
         
     Energy Device 

         An Energy Device is an Energy Object that may be  
         monolithic or contain Energy Device Components. 
        
     Energy Device Component 

       An Energy Device Component is an Energy Object contained in 
       an Energy Device, for which the containing Energy Device 
       provides individual energy management functions.  Typically, 
       the Energy Device Component is part the Energy Device 
       physical containment tree in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133]. 
        
     Energy Management Domain 

       An Energy Management Domain is a set of Energy Objects where all 
       objects in the domain are considered one unit of management.  
        
       For example, power distribution units and all of the attached 
       Energy Objects are part of the same Energy Management Domain.

        For example, all EEO's drawing power from the same 
        distribution panel with the same AC voltage within a 
        building, or all EEO's in a building for which there 
        is one main meter, would comprise an Energy Management 
        Domain.  
         
        NOTES:  
        1. Typically, this set will have as members all EO's 
          that are powered from the same source. 
         
         
     Energy Object Identification 

       Energy Object Identification is a set of attributes 
       that enable an Energy Object to be: uniquely 
       identified among all Energy Management Domains; linked 
       to other systems; classified as to type, model, and or 
       manufacturer 
      
     Energy Object Context 

       Energy Object Context is a set of attributes that 
       allow an Energy Management System to classify the use 
       of the Energy Object within an organization.   
       NOTES:  
       1. The classification could contain the use and/or the 
          ranking of the Energy Object as compared to other 
          Energy Objects in the Energy Management Domain. 
         
     Energy Object Relationship 

        An Energy Objects Relationship is a functional 
        association between one or more Energy Objects 
      
        NOTES 
        1. Relationships can be named and could include 
          Aggregation, Metering, Power Source, Proxy.  
         
      
     Aggregation Relationship 

       An Energy Object may aggregate the Energy Management 
       information of one or more Energy Objects and is 
       referred to as an Aggregation Relationship.

     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      March  2012 
      
       NOTES:  
       1. Aggregate values may be obtained by reading values 
          from multiple Energy Objects and producing a single 
          value of more significant meaning such as average, 
          count, maximum, median, minimum, mode and most 
          commonly sum [SQL]. 
         
     Metering Relationship 

        An Energy Object may measure the Power or Energy of 
        another Energy Object(s) and is referred to as a 
        Metering Relationship. 
         
        Example: a PoE port on a switch measures the Power it 
        provides to the connected Energy Object. 
         
         
     Power Source Relationship 

        An Energy Object may be the source of or distributor 
        of Power to another Energy Object(s) and is referred 
        to as a Power Source Relationship.   
      
        Example: a PDU provides power for a connected host. 
         
         
     Proxy Relationship 

        An Energy Object that provides Energy Management 
        capabilities on behalf of another Energy Object is 
        referred to a Proxy Relationship.  
          
        Example: a protocol gateways device for Building 
        Management Systems (BMS) with subtended devices. 
      
         
     Energy Object Parent 

        An Energy Object Parent is an Energy Object that 
        participates in an Energy Object Relationships and is 
        considered as providing the capabilities in the 
        relationship.

     Energy Object Child 

        An Energy Object Child is an Energy Object that 
        participates in an Energy Object Relationships and is 
        considered as receiving the capabilities in the 
        relationship. 
          
      
     Power State 

        A Power State is a condition or mode of a device that 
        broadly characterizes its capabilities, power 
        consumption, and responsiveness to input. 
         
        Reference: Adapted from [IEEE1621]   
         
        NOTES:  
         
        1. A Power State can be seen as a power setting of an 
          Energy Object that influences the power 
          consumption, the available functionality, and the 
          responsiveness of the Energy Object.   
         
        2. A Power State can be viewed as one method for 
          Energy Control 
         
         
     Power State Set 

        A collection of Power States that comprise one named 
        or logical grouping of control is a Power State Set.   
      
        Example: The states {on, off, and sleep} as defined in 
        [IEEE1621], or the 16 power states as defined by the 
        [DMTF] can be considered two different Power State 
        Sets. 
         
         
     Nameplate Power 

        The Nameplate Power is the maximal (nominal) Power 
        that a device can support.  
      
        NOTES:  
         
        1. This is typically determined via load testing and 
          is specified by the manufacturer as the maximum 
          value required for operating the device.  This is

          sometimes referred to as the worst-case Power.  The 
          actual or average Power may be lower.  The 
          Nameplate Power is typically used for provisioning 
          and capacity planning. 
         
        
        
     5. Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Module 

        This section describes the basic concepts specified in the 
        Energy Management Architecture [EMAN-FMWK], with specific 
        information related to the MIB module specified in this 
        document. 
         
        The Energy Object Context MIB module defined in this document 
        defines MIB objects for identification of Energy Objects, and 
        reporting context and relationship of an Energy Object. The 
        managed objects are contained in two tables eoTable and 
        eoProxyTable.  
         
        The first table eoTable (OIDs ending with 1-18) focuses on link 
        to the other MIB modules, context of the Energy Object and the 
        relationship of the Energy Object. The second table eoProxyTable 
        describes the proxy capabilities of a Energy Object Parent for a 
        specific local Energy Object Child. The global variable 
        eoTablePeristence deals with the persistence of identity of the 
        Energy Object.

        As displayed in figure 1, the MIB objects can be classified in 
        different logical grouping of MIB objects.  
         
        1) The Energy Object Identification. See Section 5.1 "Energy 
          Object Identification".  Devices and their sub-components are 
          characterized by the power-related attributes of a physical 
          entity present in the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133]. 
        2) The Context Information. See Section 5.2 "Energy Object 
          Context" 
        3) The links to other MIB modules. See Section 5.3 "Links to 
          other Identifiers"  
        4) The Energy Object Child Relationships specific information. 
          See Section 5.4 "Child: Energy Objects Relationship." 
        5) The Energy Object Parent Relationships specific information. 
          See Section 5.5 "Parent: Energy Objects Relationship." 
        6) The Energy Object Identity Persistence. See Section 5.6 
          "Energy Object Identity Persistence" 
         
         
     5.1 Energy Object Identification    

        Refer to the "Energy Object Information" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information about Energy Objects.   
         
        Every Energy Object MUST implement the unique index, 
        entPhysicalIndex, from the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133], which is used 
        as index for the primary Energy Object information in the 
        ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module. 
          
        Every Energy Object MUST have a printable name assigned to it. 
        Energy Objects MUST implement the entPhysicalName object 
        specified in the ENTITY-MIB, which must contain the Energy 
        Object name.  

        By the [RFC4133] definition, the entPhysicalUris contains a 
        white space separated list of Uniform Resource Identifier 
        (s)(URIs).  For the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB compliance, every 
        Energy Object instance MUST implement the entPhysicalUris from 
        the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133].  The entPhysicalUris MUST contain the 
        Energy Object UUID, in a form consistent with [RFC4122].  Note 
        that the entPhysicalUris, from the ENTITY-MIB, is a read-write 
        managed object, and that, as a consequence the UUID could be set 
        by a management system.   

        As displayed in [RFC4122], the following is an example of the 
        string representation of a UUID as a URN: urn:uuid:f81d4fae-
        7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6.

        Other ENTITY MIB related managed objects, in addition to 
        entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalName, and entPhysicalUris [RFC4133] 
        MAY be implemented.  For example, to understand the relationship 
        between Energy Object Components and Energy Objects, the ENTITY-
        MIB physical containment tree [RFC4133] MUST be implemented. 
        A second example deals with one of the ENTITY-MIB extensions: if 
        the Energy Object temperature is required, the managed objects 
        from the ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB [RFC3433] should be supported. 
         
        When an Energy Object Parent acts as a Power Aggregator or a 
        Power Proxy, the Energy Object Parent and its Energy Object 
        Child/Children MUST be members of the same Energy Management 
        Domain, specified by the eoDomainName MIB Object.  
         
        Each Energy Object MUST belong to a single Energy Management 
        Domain or in other words, an Energy Object cannot belong to more 
        than one Energy Management Domain.  Refer to the "Energy 
        Management Domain" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for background 
        information.  The eoDomainName, which is an element of the 
        eoTable, is a read-write MIB object.  The Energy Management 
        Domain should map 1-1 with a metered or sub-metered portion of 
        the network.  The Energy Management Domain MUST be configured on 
        the Energy Object Parent.  The Energy Object Children MAY 
        inherit the some of the domain parameters (possibly domain name, 
        some of the context information such as role or keywords, 
        importance) from the Energy Object Parent or the Energy 
        Management Domain MAY be configured directly in an Energy Object 
        Child.  
         

     5.2 Energy Object Context 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Context" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for 
        background information. 
         
        An Energy Object must  provide a value for eoImportance in the 
        range of 1..100 to help differentiate the use or relative value 
        of the device.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) 
        to 100 (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   
      
        An Energy Object can provide a set of eoKeywords. These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Energy Management Domains.

     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      March  2012 
      
        An Energy Object can be classified based on the physical 
        properties of the Energy Object.  That Energy Object can be 
        classified as consuming power or supplying power to other 
        devices or that Energy Object can perform both of those 
        functions and finally, an Energy Object can be a passive meter.   
         
      
        Additionally, an Energy Object can provide an eoRoleDescription 
        string that indicates the purpose the Energy Object serves in 
        the network. 
      

         
     5.3 Links to Other Identifiers    

        While the entPhysicalIndex is the primary index for all MIB 
        objects in the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module, the Energy 
        Management Systems (EnMS) must be able to make the link with the 
        identifier(s) in other supported MIB modules. 
      
        If the Energy Object is a PoE port, and if the Power over  
        Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported by the Energy Object SNMP 
        agent, then the Energy Object eoethPortIndex and 
        eoethPortGrpIndex MUST contain the values of pethPsePortIndex 
        and pethPsePortGroupIndex [RFC3621].  
         
        The Energy Object eoLldpPortNumber MUST contain the 
        lldpLocPortNum from the LLDP MIB [LLDP-MIB], if the LLDP-MED MIB 
        is supported on the Energy Object SNMP agent. 
         
        The intent behind the links to the other MIB module 
        identifier(s) is to correlate the instances in the different MIB 
        modules.  This will allow the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB MIB 
        module to reference other MIB modules in cases where the Power 
        over Ethernet and the LLDP MIB modules are supported by the SNMP 
        agent.  Some use cases may not implement any of these two MIB 
        modules for the Energy Objects.  However, in situation where any 
        of these two MIB modules are implemented, the EnMS must be able 
        to correlate the instances in the different MIB modules. 
         
        The eoAlternateKey alternate key object specifies a manufacturer 
        defined string that can be used to identify the Energy Object.  
        Since EnMS may need to correlate objects across management 
        systems, this alternate key is provided to facilitate such a 
        link.  This optional value is intended as a foreign key or 
        alternate identifier for a manufacturer or EnMS to use to 
        correlate the unique Energy Object Id in other systems or

     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      March  2012 
      
        namespaces. If an alternate key is not available or is not 
        applicable then the value is the zero-length string. 
                        
         
     5.4 Child: Energy Object Relationships 

        Refer to the "Energy Object Parent and Child" section in [EMAN-
        FMWK] for background information. 
         
        In order to link the Energy Object Child and the Energy Object 
        Parent, multiple objects are introduced in the MIB module.  
        Depending on the Energy Object Relationship type, the following 
        objects are appropriate: 
         
          
          Metering Relationship         ->   eoMeteredBy 
          
          
          Power Source Relationship     ->   eoPoweredBy 
          
          
           
          
          Aggregation Relationship      ->   eoAggregatedBy 
          
         Proxy Relationship            ->   eoProxyBy, 
                                       ->   eoProxyAbilities 
         
        Each object contains the list of Energy Object Parent UUIDs for 
        the specific Energy Object Relationship type.  The UUIDs MUST 
        comply to the RFC 4122 specifications.  The object contains URIs 
        and, therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 
        3986 [RFC3986], section 2.  Multiple URIs may be present and are 
        separated by white space characters.  Leading and trailing white 
        space characters are ignored. 
               
        For example, if an Energy Object Child is powered by two power 
        sources, eoPoweredBy would contain the two power sources UUIDs, 
        separated by a space: "urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-
        00a0c91e6bf6 urn:uuid:abcdec11-7abc-23e1-b876-00a0c91e6bf8". 
         
        The eoProxyAbilities object is specific to the Proxy 
        Relationship.  This object describes the capabilities of the 
        Energy Object Parent for the Energy Object Child represented by 
        the entPhysicalIndex. The possible capabilities are: report, 
        configuration, and/or wakeonlan.  This object only applies to an 
        Energy Object Child.  
         
        If the Energy Object is not an Energy Object Child, or if the 
        Energy Object doesn't have an Energy Object Relationship, the 
      
      
     <Parello, Claise>        Expires Sep 13, 2012            [Page 20] 
         
     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      March  2012 
      
        eoMeteredBy, eoPoweredBy, eoAggregatedBy, eoProxyBy, and 
        eoProxyAbilities objects are not instantiated.  A zero length 
        octet string MAY also be returned in this case. The eoMeteredBy, 
        eoPoweredBy, eoAggregatedBy, eoProxyBy, and eoProxyAbilities 
        implementations are optional. 
         
      
        The Energy Object Child can indicate that it wants its Energy 
        Object Parent to proxy capabilities such as, energy reporting, 
        power state configurations, non physical wake capabilities (such 
        as Wake-on-LAN)), or any combination of capabilities.  These 
        capabilities are indicated in the eoProxyAbilities object. In 
        the case of Energy Object Parent, the eoProxyAbilities MUST be 
        set to "none" (0). 
         
        Since the communication between the Energy Object Parent and 
        Energy Object Child may not be via SNMP (as defined in EMAN-
        FMWK), an Energy Object Child can have additional MIB objects 
        that can be used for easier identification by the EnMS. The 
        optional objects eoMgmtMacAddress, eoMgmtAddressType 
        eoMgmtDNSName can be used to help identify the relationship 
        between the child and other NMS objects.  These objects can be 
        used as an alternate key to help link the Energy Object with 
        other keyed information that may be stored within the EnMS(s). 
         
         
        

     5.5 Parent: Energy Object Relationships 

       When the Energy Object is an Energy Object Parent, the 
       eoChildrenList object represents the list of Energy Object 
       Child(ren) UUIDs.  This UUID list will help in the network 
       discovery of Energy Objects, using the Energy Object Parent as 
       entry points. 
        
        eoChildrenList has the same format as the eoMeteredBy, 
        eoPoweredBy,  eoAggregatedBy, and eoProxyBy. The UUIDs MUST 
        comply to the RFC 4122 specifications.  The UUIDs MUST comply to 
        the RFC 4122 specifications.  The eoChildrenList object contains 
        URIs and, therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to 
        RFC 3986 [RFC3986], section 2.  Multiple URIs may be present and 
        are separated by white space characters.  Leading and trailing 
        white space characters are ignored.

     Internet-Draft   < Energy Object Context MIB >      March  2012 
      
        If the Energy Object is not an Energy Object Parent, the 
        eoChildrenList objects is not instantiated.  A zero length octet 
        string MAY also be returned in this case. 
         
        The eoChildrenList implementation is optional. 
         
         
         
     5.6 Energy Object Identity Persistence 

        In some situations, the Energy Object identity information 
        should be persistent even after a device reload.  For example, 
        in a static setup where a switch monitors a series of connected 
        PoE phones, there is a clear benefit for the EnMS if the Energy 
        Object Identification and all associated information persist, as 
        it saves a network discovery.  However, in other situations, 
        such as a wireless access point monitoring the mobile user PCs, 
        there is not much advantage to persist the Energy Object 
        Information.  Therefore, a specific MIB object, the 
        eoTablePersistence, enables and disables the persistence 
        globally for all Energy Objects information in the eoTable and 
        eoProxyTable MIB tables.

     7. Security Considerations  

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

          . Unauthorized changes to the eoDomainName, entPhysicalName, 
             eoRoleDescription, eoKeywords, and/or eoImportance MAY 
             disrupt power and energy collection, and therefore any 
             predefined policies defined in the network. 
         
      
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
         
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         
         
     8. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
          Descriptor                         OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
          ----------                         ----------------------- 
          energyAwareMIB                     { mib-2 xxx } 
                     
        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.
