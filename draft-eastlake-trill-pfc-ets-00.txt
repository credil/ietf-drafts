INTERNET-DRAFT                                TRILL: PFC and ETS Support


1. Introduction

   IEEE 802.1 has developed various standards as part of its Data Center
   Bridging (DCB) activity. The intent of these standards is (1) to
   efficiently minimize data loss due to queue overflow for selected
   classes of traffic within Local Area Networks (LANs) meeting certain
   conditions and (2) to provide limited means to allocate the available
   bandwidth to different classes of traffic. Those standardes are
   Priority Based Flow Control (the IEEE [802.1Qbb] standard), Enhanced
   Tramission Selection (the IEEE [802.1Qaz] standard), and the
   Congestion Notification (CN) feature in the IEEE [802.1Q] standard.
   Intended uses include the support of loss sensitive services, such as
   Fiber Channel over Ethernet [FCoE], in data centers.

   Because they are primarily implemented at the port level, no changes
   in the TRILL protocol are required to support PFC or ETS which are
   discussed in this document. CN support by TRILL may be considered in
   a separate document.

   The existing optional PAUSE feature of IEEE 802.3 (Annex 31B of
   [802.3]) can, with appropriate engineering, also provide Ethernet
   service without loss of frames due to queue overflow. However, PAUSE
   has problems as follows:

   1. Traffic for some protocols, for example TCP [RFC793], requires
      frame losses to signal congestion for flow control. Elimination of
      frame drops due to congestion would prevent TCP flow control,
      unless some other mechanism were added.

   2. Some traffic consists of time critical network control frames, for
      example IS-IS Hellos [IS-IS]. PAUSE is relatively indiscriminant
      and pauses such frames, except for some MAC Control frames such as
      PAUSE control frames themselves, along with less critical traffic.
      Pausing such critical network control frames can compromise
      transport connectivity.

   3. PAUSE can result in intermittent waves of spreading traffic
      paralysis, crippling network throughput, as follows: When a switch
      S1 receives a PAUSE on a port P1 and can no longer transmit frames
      out that port it is likely that output queues to P1 will fill up
      quickly. As soon as one output queue to P1 is full or almost so
      then, to avoid frame loss, S1 must send PAUSE frames out on each
      of its ports that might receive a frame for output to P1. For
      example, it might have to PAUSE input on P2 through P9,
      unnecessarily blocking traffic between any pair of those ports, to
      be sure it will not receive input on any of them for P1. This can
      repeat in switches connected to S1, switches connected to switches
      connected to S1, etc.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                TRILL: PFC and ETS Support


1.1 Overview of PFC and ETS

   Overviews of the PFC and ETS standards covered herein are given
   below. IEEE 802.1 has specified these standards and the behavior
   needed to support them in bridges and end stations. This document
   discusses the support of these standards in TRILL switches [RFC6325].

   IEEE [802.1Qbb], Priority-based Flow Control (PFC), provides a frame
   priority based refinement of the Ethernet PAUSE feature as described
   in Section 2. To the extent that a switch implements separate queues
   for different priorities at each port, this can eliminate the first
   and second of the PAUSE problems listed above. Traffic requiring
   frame drops due to congestion can be assigned a priority for which
   PFC is not enabled. PFC is not normally enabled for the two highest
   priorities, 6 and 7, which are typically used for time sensitive
   control frames. PFC also reduces the third problem as any congestion
   spreading would affect only priorities with PFC enabled.

   IEEE [802.1Qaz] is a standard covering two things: One, Enhanced
   Transmission Selection (ETS), allocates bandwidth between traffic
   class groups indicated by priority. It is described in Section 3.
   Second, [802.1Qaz] contains the specification of the Data Center
   Bridging Exchange Protocol (DCBX) for discovering and configuring the
   three standards that this document covers, as described in Section 4.

   PFC and ETS may be implemented independently or in any combination
   except that implementation of either of them implies implementation
   of DCBX, specified in IEEE [802.1Qaz].

2. Priority-Based Flow Control

   IEEE [802.1Qbb], Priority-Based Flow Control (PFC), refines the IEEE
   [802.3] PAUSE feature to permit separately requesting the pausing and
   unpausing the traffic of each of the eight available frame priority
   levels. The actual priority-based pause control frame is specified in
   IEEE [802.3bd].

   Such queue pausing occurs within the transmission logic associated
   with a port and requires no changes to the TRILL protocol, which is
   implemented above such port logic, as described in [RFC6325].
   LLDP/DCBX is used in PFC discovery and agreement with peers as
   described in Section 4. A TRILL switch implementing the PFC standard
   should implement DCBX, signaling PFC support and configuration.
   Guarantee of lossless handling of frames with a particular priority
   in a TRILL campus requires implementation and enablement of PFC for
   that priority at all end stations that originate frames and all TRILL
   switches and bridges in that campus as well as meeting the PFC
   engineering requirements in [802.1Qbb].

   The PFC control frames specified in [802.3bd] are MAC control frames
   that are not VLAN tagged. Their transmission normally bypasses the
   output queue at a port so they are transmitted immediately, or as
   soon as the frame currently being transmitted is sent, so as to meet
   the timing requirements of PFC.

3. Enhanced Transmission Selection

   Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS), specified in IEEE [802.1Qaz],
   allocates bandwidth, between traffic classes, through each of the
   ports of a switch or end station. (To be more precise, it modifies
   the algorithm used to select, from multiple priority-based output
   queues at a port, the next frame to transmit. Provision is made for
   proprietary algorithms and 802.1 has also specified an algorithm in
   connection with precise frame timing (AVB), but we are only concerned
   with the default algorithm.)

   Transmission selection occurs within the logic associated with a port
   and requires no changes to the TRILL protocol, which is implemented
   above such port logic, as described in [RFC6325]. A TRILL switch
   implementing the ETS standard should implement DCBX (see Section 4)
   signaling of ETS support and configuration. For ETS to be effective,
   traffic in different ETS groups cannot share an output queue.

4. The DCB Exchange Protocol

   The DCB Exchange Protocol (DCBX) is specified in IEEE [802.1Qaz],
   which also specifies ETS as described in Section 3.

   DCBX is built on the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), which is
   specified in IEEE [802.1AB]. DCBX is used for the discovery of DCB
   capabilities of peer switches, for the detection of inconsistent
   configuration of DCB features between peer switches, and for the
   propagation of DCB features to switches configured to accept
   configuration via DCBX. For purposes of TRILL protocol peering, TRILL
   switches ignore intervening bridges, but for the purposes of LLDP and
   DCBX all stations, including TRILL switches, 802.1 bridges, and end
   stations are considered peers.

   TRILL switches implementing PFC or ETS should also implement DCBX.
