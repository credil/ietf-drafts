<abstract>
	<t>
	The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of
	cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data.  The algorithms specified for
	use with DNSSEC are reflected in an IANA maintained registry.  This document presents a set of changes for
	some entries of the registry.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
	The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />,
	<xref target="RFC4035" />, <xref target="RFC4509" />, <xref target="RFC5155" />, and <xref target="RFC5702" /> 
        uses digital signatures over DNS data
	to provide source authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry
	to list codes for digital signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic
	algorithm and one-way hash function).   
	</t>
	<t>
    This document updates a set of entries in the IANA registry for Domain Name
	System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers.  These new entries are given in Section 2.2 below. This list includes changes to selected entries originally set aside for future algorithm specification that did
    not occur. These three entries are changed to "Reserved" to avoid potential conflicts with older implementations.  This 
    document also brings the list of references for entries up to date.
	</t>
	<t>
	There are auxillery registries related to the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers registry
	that deal with various Diffie-Hellmen parameters used with DNSSEC. These registry tables are not altered by
	this document. 
	</t>
</section>
<section title="The DNS Security Algorithm Number Sub-registry">
	<t>
	The DNS Security Algorithm Number sub-registry (part of the Domain Name
	System (DNS) Security Number registry) contains a set of entries that contain errors. 
        There are additional differences to entries that are described in sub-section 2.1 and
	the complete list of changed registry entries is in sub-section 2.2.  
	</t>
  <section title="Updates and Additions">
        <t>
        This document updates three entries in the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
	Algorithm Registry.  They are:
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved".</t> 
    <t>
	The above values are changed to "Reserved" because they were placeholders for algorithms that
	were not fully specified for use with DNSSEC.  Older implementations may still have these algorithm 
	codes assigned, so these codes are reserved to prevent potential incompatibilities.  
	</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number Registry Table">
	<figure><preamble>
	The list of Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number registry entry changes are 
	given below. All other existing entries in the registry table are unchanged by this document 
	and are not shown.
	The other two tables in this registry (DNS KEY Record Diffie-Hellman Prime Lengths and
	DNS KEY Record Diffie-Hellman Well-Known Prime/Generator Pairs) are not changed in any way
	by this document.
