                  Requirements for Power Aware Network
                    draft-dong-panet-requirement-02

Abstract

   Energy consumption of networks is rising fast, which results in the
   increase of network operational costs.  There are emerging demands
   from operators for power-aware networking (PANET) which could
   adaptively reduce the network energy consumption when possible.  This
   document presents the requirements which should be considered in
   building a power aware network.

1.  Introduction

   With the increase of network services and exponential growth of
   traffic volume, the network operators are expanding their
   infrastructures with more high-capacity, full-featured network
   devices, which also leads to the increase of network energy
   consumption.  Besides, today's service provider networks are mostly
   designed for high performance and reliability, without much
   consideration of energy efficiency.  These networks usually have
   redundant routers and links, over-provisioned link capacity, and
   multiple paths for load-balancing and protection, which make the
   networks far from energy efficient.  As energy price continues to
   rise, the increasing network energy consumption becomes a significant
   portion of the network operational costs.  The energy consumption
   problem in service provider networks is detailed in
   [I-D.zhang-panet-problem-statement].  Some use cases of reducing
   network energy consumption are described in
   [I-D.zhang-panet-use-cases].

   While energy consumption has become an important issue, network
   operators are very cautious about energy conservation solutions due
   to the concerns about the potential impacts on the network
   performance and resiliency.

   This document presents a set of requirements for building a Power
   Aware NETwork (PANET) while meeting operators' requirements on
   performance and resiliency.

2.  Requirements on Network Elements

   Today's network elements are mostly designed for high throughput and
   availability.  With the increase of throughput capacity, energy
   consumption of network element is also rising accordingly.  Since
   most of time the network elements in the network would not work in
   the full loaded state, if the energy consumption of network elements
   could be proportional to the carried traffic load, energy
   conservation could be achieved.  Typically after a network element is
   turned on, the base energy consumption is relatively high, and the
   energy consumption of the device does not vary a lot from zero load
   state to full loaded state.  While there has been a lot of efforts
   aiming at making the energy consumption of network device
   proportional to the load it carries, it is not quite easy for the
   network elements getting to this stage in the near term.

   Thus for near term energy saving, In practical the network elements
   should meet the following requirements:

   o  Network elements should support a set of energy saving modes (e.g.
      sleeping mode, etc. as defined in IETF EMAN working group).  The
      energy consumption under energy saving modes should be much lower
      than that under the normal mode.

   o  Network elements should support the report of energy consumption
      and state information.

   o  The transition between different energy modes SHOULD not cost a
      lot of energy, otherwise there will not be no much benefit of
      transiting between different energy modes.

   o  Network elements should support the transition between different
      energy modes within acceptable time period, e.g. subsecond.

   o  Network elements should support some approach of reducing the
      packet loss during the transition of energy modes.

3.  Requirements on the Whole Network

Internet-Draft              PANET Requirement               October 2013


   While energy awareness and conservation of individual network element
   is fundamental, currently there are many limits in reducing the
   energy consumption at network element level.  Besides, different from
   terminal devices like PC and mobile phones, network elements usually
   cannot be shut down arbitrarily as this may affect the services
   carried in the network.  Thus mechanisms which could reduce the
   energy consumption from the whole network point of view should also
   be considered.

   Most of the existing networks are over-provisioned for better service
   performance and redundancy, which means they are not energy efficient
   by default.  In order to save energy, the entire network should
   become power aware, then it can make appropriate decisions to save
   energy when possible.  Since in most time the network does not carry
   the peak traffic volume, which means there is chance for the network
   to coordinate network elements and create opportunity for some of the
   network elements to enter energy saving modes.  Meanwhile, reducing
   energy consumption of the network should not undermine the
   performance of services carried by the network.

   For energy conservation of the whole network, the network should meet
   the following requirements:

   o  The network should try to keep all the active network elements
      with a reasonable utilization rate, network elements with low
      utilization should be informed to enter energy saving modes.  For
      example, the network elements with utilization lower than specific
      threshold may be put into low rate mode to reduce energy
      consumption, or the traffic carried by these network elements may
      be migrated to other paths such that these network elements could
      be put into sleeping mode.

   o  With energy conservation, the network should retain enough network
      availability and resiliency against node and link failures.  In
      other words, the redundancy of the network should be kept at a
      reasonable level, e.g. 2-connected.

   o  Energy saving of the network should not induce increase of latency
      nor induce traffic loss which exceed the tolerance of the services
      in the network.  QoS metrics such as end-to-end delay, loss and
      jitter should be kept at a desired level.

   o  The network should reserve enough spare capacity or be able to
      react quickly to absorb traffic spikes in order to minimize packet
      loss due to congestions.

   o  The network stability should be preserved.  Particularly, traffic
      oscillation should be avoided.

   o  Energy saving should not conflict with other policies (e.g.
      performance at the highest priority) in the network.

4.  Requirements on Network Control Plane

   Most of the existing network control protocols do not take energy
   awareness or efficiency into consideration, and some protocols may
   not work properly when some of the network elements in the network
   are in energy saving modes.  For example, when a network link is put
   into sleeping mode, the protocols run on this link may be impacted.

   For energy saving of the whole network, control plane should meet the
   following requirements:

   o  Control plane should be able to work properly when some of the
      network elements are in energy saving mode.

   o  Control plane should support the advertisement of energy related
      information (e.g. current energy saving mode) of network elements
      in the network.

   o  Control plane should be able to coordinate the energy saving
      operations of network elements to achieve the overall network
      energy saving.

   o  Control plane should be able to maximize the opportunity for
      network elements to enter the energy saving modes.

   o  Control plane should be aware of the network elements in energy
      saving modes, and should be able to calculate available paths
      (e.g. which do not traverse the network elements in sleeping
      mode).

   o  Control plane should be able to calculate the path set for all
      services carried by the network in a way that energy conservation
      of the whole network is achieved.

   Some considerations on control plane when using energy saving
   mechanism are also specified in [I-D.retana-rtgwg-eacp].

   Management plane would also be necessary for building a power aware
   network.  IETF EMAN working group is working on the requirements
   [I-D.ietf-eman-requirements]and mechanisms for energy management.
   Such management requirements include identification of energy-managed
   devices and their components, monitoring of a series of power states
   and power properties.  It may further includes controlling of the
   power supply and power states of the managed devices.
