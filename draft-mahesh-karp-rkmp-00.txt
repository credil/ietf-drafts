              Key Management for Pairwise Routing Protocol
                       draft-mahesh-karp-rkmp-00

Abstract

   When running routing protocols such as BGP or RSVP-TE, two routers
   need to exchange routing messages in a unicast (one-to-one) fashion.
   In order to authenticate these messages using symmetric cryptography,
   a secret key needs to be established.  This document defines a Router
   Key Management Protocol for establishing and managing such keys for
   routing protocols.

Internet-Draft                    rkmp                      October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Existing routing protocols using unicast communication model (e.g.,
   BGP, LDP, RSVP-TE) have cryptographic authentication mechanisms that
   use a key shared between the routers on the both sides of the model
   to protect routing message exchanges between the routers.  Unicast
   key management today is limited to statically configuring master keys
   in individual routers.  This document extends currently defined IKEv2
   [RFC5996] protocol to define a Router Key Management Protocol (RKMP)
   that allows network devices to automatically exchange key material
   related information between the network devices.

   RKMP assumes that routers need to be provisioned with some
   credentials for a one-to-one authentication protocol.  Preshared keys
   or asymmetric keys and an authorization list are expected to be
   common deployments.

   If two routers running a routing protocol have not authenticated each
   other yet, and before sending out any routing protocol packets the
   two routers need to perform mutual authentication using their
   provisioned credentials.  If successful, two routers negotiate the
   key material to secure the routing protocol execution.

1.1.  Terminology

1.2.  Acronyms and Abbreviations

   The following acronyms and abbreviations are used throughout this
   document.

   IKE   Internet Key Exchange Protocol

   IKEv2 Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2

   SA    Security Association

1.3.  Relationship to IKEv2

   IKEv2 provides a protocol for authenticating IPsec security
   associations between two peers.  It currently provides no group
   keying.  IKEv2 is attractive as a basis for this protocol because
   while it is much simpler than IKE [RFC2409], it provides all the
   needed flexibility in one-to-one authentication.

   Unlike IKE, IKEv2 is explicitly designed for IPsec.  The document
   does not separate handling aspects of the protocol that would be
   needed for IPsec from those that apply to general key management.
   IPsec specific rules are combined with more general requirements.

Internet-Draft                    rkmp                      October 2011


   While concepts and protocol payloads can be used in a different key
   management protocol, the current structure of IKEv2 does not provide
   a mechanism for applying IKEv2 to a domain of interpretation other
   than IPsec.  In addition, the complexity required in the IKE
   specification when compared to IKEv2 suggests that the generality of
   IKE may not be worth the complexity cost.

   This protocol borrows concepts and payloads from IKEv2 but does not
   normatively depend on the IKEv2 specification.


2.  Overview

   [Need an overview of how RKMP works, maybe a protocol flow picture
   and/or state machine picture.  This would be a preface to the actual
   protocol descriptions in Section 3.]

2.1.  Types of Keys

   The keys adopted in RKMP are listed as follows:

   o  PSK (Pre-Shared Key) : PSKs are pair-wise unique keys used for
      authenticating one router to the other one during the initial
      exchange.  These keys are configured by some mechanism such as
      manual configuration or a management application outside of the
      scope of RKMP.

   o  Seed key: Refers to value derived from SKEYSEED that is used to
      derive new keys (e.g., for TCP-AO).

   o  Protocol master key: A protocol master key is the key exported by
      RKMP for use by a routing protocol such as BGP.  This is the key
      that is shared in the key table between the routing protocol and
      RKMP.

   o  Transport key: A transport key is the key used to integrity
      protect routing messages in a protocol such as BGP.  In today's
      routing protocol cryptographic authentication mechanisms the
      transport key can be the same as the protocol master key.


3.  Protocol Exchanges

   The exchange of private keying material between two network devices
   using a dedicated key management protocol is a requirement as
   articulated in [I-D.ietf-karp-routing-tcp-analysis].  There is no
   need to define an entirely new protocol for this purpose, when
   existing mature protocol exchanges and methods have been vetted.

   This draft makes use of the IKEv2 protocol exchanges, state machine,
   and policy definitions to define a dedicated key management protocol.
   However, as IKEv2 was developed exclusively for the use of IPsec,
   these protocol exchanges are incorporated by reference into the
   present key protocol definitions, and are exchanged using a dedicated
   UDP port number (TDB - IANA).  The use of a dedicated UDP port will
   clearly differentiate this protocol from IKEv2.

   In the following figures, the notations contained in the message are
   defined as follows.

                    Acronyms Used in Protocol Exchange

3.1.  RP_INIT

   The RP Initial Exchange (RP_INIT) is identical to the IKE_SA_INIT
   exchange defined in Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
   [RFC5996].  The RP_INIT exchange is a two-message exchange that
   allows the network devices to negotiate cryptographic algorithms,
   exchange nonces, and do a Diffe-Hellman (DH) [DH] exchange, for their
   routing protocols, after which protocols on these network devices can
   communicate privately.  Note that at this point the network devices
   have not identified their peer.  For the details of this exchange,
   refer to IKE_SA_INIT in Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
   [RFC5996].

                                  RP_INIT

3.2.  RP_AUTH

   Next, the network devices perform a RP Authentication exchange
   (RP_AUTH), which is substantially the same as the IKE_AUTH exchange
   defined in RFC 5996, except that the SA payload contains policy
   specific to the routing protocol security policy (labeled SArpi and
   SArpr) rather than IPsec policy (SAi2, SAr2 defined in RFC 5996).
   The SArpi and SArpr payloads are described in Section 3; for the
   details of the rest of the exchange please refer to IKE_AUTH in RFC
   5996.

     Peer (Initiator)                      Peer (Responder)
     --------------------                  ------------------
     HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
         [IDr,] AUTH, SArpi}       -->
                                   <--     HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                                    SArpr}

                                  RP_AUTH

   In the RP_AUTH exchange, the Initiator proposes one or more sets of
   policies for one routing protocol in the SArpi.  The Responder
   returns the one policy contained in SArpi that it accepts.  Based on
   this policy, appropriate keying material is derived from the existing
   shared keying material.  At the successful conclusion of the RP_AUTH
   exchange, the initiator and responder have agreed upon a single set
   of policy and keying material for a particular routing protocol.

3.3.  RP_ADD

   The network devices may then destroy the state associated with the RP
   SA, continuing to use the RP policy and keying material, or they may
   choose to retain them for the further use.  If both the network
   devices choose to retain them, they may use the RP SA to subsequently
   agree upon replacement policy for the same RP, or agree upon policy
   and keying material for another routing protocol.  Either case will
   require the use of the RP Additional Exchange (RP_ADD), similar to
   the IKEv2 CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange as defined in RFC 5996.

   A RP_ADD exchange therefore can be triggered in order to

                                  RP_ADD

   A RP_ADD exchange MAY be initiated by either end of the SA after the
   initial exchanges are completed.  All messages in a RP_ADD exchange
   are cryptographically protected using the cryptographic algorithms
   and keys negotiated in the the initial exchange.

   In the RP_ADD exchange, the SA payloads in the RP_ADD exchange are
   used identically as in the RP_AUTH exchange.  For details on the rest
   of the exchange, refer to the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange as defined in
   RFC 5996.

3.4.  INFORMATIONAL

   The IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange is also useful for deleting specific
   RP SAs or sending status information.  The Notify (N) and Delete (D)
   payloads are as those defined by IKEv2 [IKEV2-PARAMS].  For example,
   if the Responder refused to accept one of Proposals sent by the
   Initiator, it would return an INFORMATIONAL exchange of type
   NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN instead of the response to RP_ADD.

   to be created to identify the RP exchange types and payloads
   described in this section.

4.1.  Security Association Payload

   The Security Association (SA) payload contains a list of Proposals,
   which describe one or more sets of policy that a router is willing to
   use to protect a routing protocol.  It is identical to the SA payload
   described in RFC 5996, and the details of the fields are described
   there.

   In the Initiator's message, the SArpi payload contains a list of
   Proposal payloads (as defined in the next section), each of which
   contains a single set of policy that can be applied to the packets
   described in the Traffic Selector (TS) payloads in the same exchange.
   For example, the TS payloads may describe a set of IP addresses and
   ports which are a BGP connection, and the SA payload contains a list
   of proposals describing what policy the router is willing to use to
   protect that BGP traffic.  Each set of policy is given a particular
   "Proposal Number" uniquely identifying this set of policy.

   The responder includes a single Proposal payload in it's SA policy,
   which denotes the choice it has made amongst the initiator's list of
   Proposals.  Any attributes of a selected transform MUST be returned
   unmodified as explained in IKEv2 [RFC5996] section 3.3.6.  The
   initiator of an exchange MUST check that the accepted offer is
   consistent with one of its proposals, and if not MUST terminate the
   exchange.

   this exchange.  The value SK_D is defined in RFC 5996, and refers to
   the value derived from SKEYSEED that is used to derive new keys
   (e.g., for TCP-AO).

                     <TCP-AO master key> = prf+(SK_d, Ni | Nr)

                             Routing Protocol


5.  Operation Details

5.1.  General

   KMPRP is used to dynamically derive key material information between
   the two network devices trying to establish or maintain a routing
   protocol neighbor adjacency.  Typically network devices running the
   routing protocols establish neighbor adjacencies at the routing
   protocol level.  These routing protocols may run different security
   algorithms that provide transport level security for the protocol
   neighbor adjacencies.  Depending on the security algorithm used, the
   routing protocols are configured with security algorithm specific
   keys that are either long term keys or short term session keys.
   These keys are specific to the security algorithms used to enforce
   transport level security for the routing protocols.

   A routing protocol causes KMPRP to execute when it needs key material
   to establish neighbor adjacency.  This can be as a result of the
   routing protocol neighbor being configured, neighbor changed or
   updated, a local rekey policy decision, or some other event dictated

   by the implementation.  The key material would allow the network
   devices to then independently generate the same key and establish a
   KMPRP neighbor adjacency between them.  This is typically done by the
   Initiator (KMPRP speaker) initiating a KMPRP RP_INIT exchange
   mentioned in the section 2.1 towards its KMPRP peer.  As part of
   RP_INIT exchange, KMPRP will send a message to the KMPRP peer's well
   known KMPRP UDP port [TBD] by IANA.  The format of the message is
   explained in section 3.  The procedure to exchange key information is
   explained in section 3.  Once the key material information is
   successfully exchanged by both the KMPRP speaker, the KMPRP neighbor
   adjacency may be torn down.

   The master key data received from KMPRP peers are stored in the
   separate Key Management Database known as KMDB.  KMDB follows the
   guidelines in[I-D.ietf-karp-crypto-key-table], and each entry
   consists of Key specific information, Security algorithm to which the
   Key is applicable to, Routing Protocol Clients of interest, and the
   announcing KMPRP Peer.  KMDB is also used to notify the routing
   protocols about the key updates.  Typically key material information
   is exchanged whenever a routing protocol is about to create a new
   neighbor adjacency.  This is considered as an Initial Key exchange
   mode.  Key material information is also exchanged to refresh existing
   key data on an already existing neighbor adjacency.  This is
   considered as Key rollover exchange mode.  The following sections
   describes their detail behavior.

5.2.  Initial Key Specific Data Exchange

   Routing protocols informs KMPRP of its new neighbor adjacency.  It
   does so by creating a local entry in KMDB which consists of a
   Security algorithm, Key specific information, routing protocol client
   and the routing protocol neighbor.  Upon a successful creation of
   such an entry KMPRP initiates KMPRP peering with the neighbor and
   starts initial KMPRP RP_INIT exchange explained in section 2.1
   followed by the RP_AUTH exchanged explained in section 2.2.  Once the
   key related information is successfully exchanged, KMDB may invoke
   the routing protocol client to provide key specific information
   updates if any.

5.3.  Key Specific Data Rollover Exchange

   Key rollover exchange may be initiated at a pre-configured time
   interval or as part of a manual configuration and is outside the
   scope of this document.  The procedure of Key Rollover exchange is
   exactly same as the Initial Key specific data exchange described
   above.

6.  Key Management Database (KMDB)

   Protocol interaction between KMPRP and its client routing protocols
   is typically done using KMDB.  Routing protocols update KMDB by
   installing a new Key related information or purging an existing Key
   specific information.  As part of the KMDB update, KMPRP initiates
   peering connections with its appropriate KMPRP peers to announce the
   updated key related information.  KMPRP may also receive an updated
   key related information from its peers which gets installed in KMDB.
   Whenever KMPRP updates KMDB with updated key information from its
   peers, it notifies client routing protocols of its updates.


7.  Protocol Interaction

   Routing protocols could end up with multiple keys when updated by
   KMDB.  Typically, routing protocols should use the keys till the
   point its peers have transitioned to a new key.  Once the peers have
   transitioned to a new key, routing protocols could put the old keys
   on timers and eventually free them.  The reason to put them on timer
   and not free them right away is to ensure that all out of order
   packets in TCP are handled correctly.


8.  IANA Considerations

   A new UDP port number will need to be assigned for systems that want
   to implement this protocol.

   A new IANA registry is to be created to identify the RP exchange
   types and payloads.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


9.  Security Considerations

   TBD


10.  Acknowledgements

   During the development of TCP-AO, Gregory Lebovitz noted that a
   protocol based on an IKEv2 exchange would be a good automated key
   management method for deriving a TCP-AO master key.

   Many protocol definitions and protocol formats come from RFC 5996,
