          Cross Stratum Optimization enabled Path Computation
            draft-dhody-pce-cso-enabled-path-computation-01

Abstract

   Applications like cloud computing, video gaming, HD Video streaming,
   Live Concerts, Remote Medical Surgery, etc are offered by Data
   Centers.  These data centers are geographically distributed and
   connected via a network.  Many decisions are made in the Application
   space without any concern of the underlying network.  Cross stratum
   application/network optimization focus on the challenges and
   opportunities presented by data center based applications and
   carriers networks together [CSO-DATACNTR].

   Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for
   traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
   networks.  [RFC4655] explains the architecture for a Path Computation
   Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space.

   This document explains the architecture for CSO enabled Path
   Computation.

1.  Introduction

   Many application services offered by Data Center to end-users make
   significant use of the underlying networks resources in the form of
   bandwidth consumption used to carry the actual traffic between data
   centers and/or among data center and end-users.  There is a need for
   cross optimization for both network and application resources.
   [CSO-PROBLEM] describes the problem space for cross stratum
   optimization.

   [NS-QUERY] describes the general problem of network stratum (NS)
   query in Data Center environments.  Network Stratum (NS) query is an
   ability to query the network from application controller in Data
   Centers so that decision would be jointly performed based on both the
   application needs and the network status.  Figure 1 shows typical
   data center architecture.

   NS Query is a two-stage query that consists of two stages:

   o  A vertical query capability where an external point (i.e., the
      Application Control Gateway (ACG) in Data Center) will query the
      network (i.e., the Network Control Gateway (NCG)).  The query can
      be initiated either by ACG to NCG or NCG to ACG depending on the
      mode of operation.  ACG initiated query is an application-centric
      mode while NCG initiated query is a network-centric mode.  It is
      anticipated that either ACG or NCG can be a final decision making
      point that chooses the end-to-end resources (i.e., both
      application IT resources and the network connectivity) depending
      on the mode of operation.

      information of a variety of horizontal schemes implemented in the
      network stratum.

   [CSO-PCE-REQT] describes the general requirement PCE should support
   in order to accommodate CSO capability.  This document is intended to
   fulfill the general PCE requirements discussed in the aforementioned
   reference.

   This document describes how PCE Architecture as described in
   [RFC4655] can help in the second stage of NS query.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   ACG:  Application Control Gateway.

   Application Stratum:  The application stratum is the functional block
      which manages and controls application resources and provides
      application resources to a variety of clients/end-users.
      Application resources are non-network resources critical to
      achieving the application service functionality.  Examples
      include: application specific servers, storage, content, large
      data sets, and computing power.  Data Centers are regarded as
      tangible realization of the application stratum architecture.

   CSO:  Cross Stratum Optimization.

   GMPLS:  Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   LSR:  Label Switch Router.

   MPLS:  Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   NCG:  Network Control Gateway.

   Network Stratum:  The network stratum is the functional block which
      manages and controls network resources and provides transport of
      data between clients/end-users to and among application resources.
      Network Resources are resources of any layer 3 or below (L1/L2/L3)
      such as bandwidth, links, paths, path processing (creation,

      deletion, and management), network databases, path computation,
      admission control, and resource reservation capability.

   NMS:  Network Management System

   PCC:  Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol.

   TE:  Traffic Engineering.

   TED:  Traffic Engineering Database.

   UNI:  User Network Interface.

3.  CSO enabled PCE Architecture

   In the network stratum, the Network Control Gateway (NCG) serves as
   the proxy gateway to the network.  The NCG receives the query request
   from the ACG, probes the network to test the capabilities for data
   flows to/from particular points in the network, and gathers the
   collective information of a variety of horizontal schemes implemented
   in the network stratum.  This is a horizontal query (Stage 2 in
   Figure 2).

   In this section we will describe how PCE fits in this horizontal
   scheme.

   A Path Computation Element (PCE) is an entity that is capable of
   computing a network path or route based on a network graph, and of
   applying computational constraints during the computation.

   (1) NCG and PCE are co-located.

   In this composite solution, the same node implements functionality of
   both NCG and PCE.  When a network stratum query is received from the
   ACG (stage 1), this query is broken into one or more Path computation
   requests and handled by the PCE functionality co-located with the
   NCG.  There is no need for PCEP protocol here.  In this case, an
   external PCE interface (e.g., CLI, SNMP, proprietary) needs to be
   supported.  This is out of the scope of this document.

   In this solution, an external node implements PCE functionality.
   Network stratum query received from the ACG (stage 1) is converted
   into Path computation requests at the NCG and relayed to the external
   PCE using the PCEP [RFC5440].  In this case the NCG includes Path
   Computation Client (PCC) functionalities.

                      Figure 4: NCG and external PCE

   PCE has the capability to compute constrained paths between a source
   and one or more destination(s), optionally providing the value of the
   metrics associated to the computed path(s).  Thus it can fit very
   well in the horizontal query stage of CSO.  A PCE MAY have further
   capability to do multi-layer and/or inter-domain path computation
   which can be further utilized.  NCG which understands the vertical
   query and the presence of applications constraints can break the
   application request into suitable path computation request which PCE
   understands.  In this scenario, the PCE MAY have no knowledge of
   applications and provide only network related metrics to the NCG: the
   NCG (or the ACG for an application-centric model) is in charge of
   correlating the network quotations with the application layer
   information to achieve the global CSO objective.

   With this architecture, NCG can request PCE different sets of

   computation mode that are not currently supported by PCE.  For
   instance, NCG may request PCE a multi-destination and multi-source
   path computation request.  This scenario arises when there are many
   possible Data Center choices for a given application request and
   there could be multiple sources for this request.  Multi-destination
   with a single source (aka., anycast) is a default case for multi-
   destination and multi-source path computation.

   In addition, with this architecture, NCG may have different sets of
   objectives and constraints than typical path computation requests.
   For instance, multi-criteria objective functions that combine the
   bandwidth requirement and latency may be very useful for some
   applications.

   In a Statefull PCE, there is a strict synchronization of the network
   states (in term of topology and resource information), and the set of
   computed paths and reserved resources in use in the network.  In
   other words, the PCE utilizes information from the TED as well as
   information about existing paths (for example, TE LSPs) in the
   network when processing new requests.  Statefull PCE will be very
   important tool to achieve the goals of cross stratum optimization as
   maintains the status of final path selected after cross (application
   and network) optimization.

   As Statefull PCE would keep both LSP ID and the application ID
   associated with the LSP, it will make path computation more efficient
   in terms of resource usage and computation time.  Moreover, Statefull
   PCE would have an accurate snapshot of network resource information
   and as such it can increase adaptability to the changes.  This may be
   important for some application that requires a stringent performance
   objective.

   In conclusion -

   o  NCG can use the PCE to do path computation based on constrains
      from multiple sources and destinations.

   o  Statefull PCE can help in maintaining the status of the final
      cross optimized path.  It can also help NCG in maintaining the
      relationship of application request and setup path.  In case of
      any change of the path, the Statefull PCE and NCG and cooperate
      and take suitable action.

4.  Path Computation and Setup Procedure

   Path computation flow is shown in Figure 5.

   1.  User for application would contact the application gateway ACG
       with its requirements.

   2.  ACG would further query the NCG to obtain the underlying network
       Status and quotations (offers) for the network connectivity
       services.

   3.  NCG would break the vertical request into suitable horizontal
       path computation request(s).

   4.  PCE would provide the result to NCG.

   5.  NCG would abstract the computation result and provide to ACG.

   6.  NCG and ACG would cooperate to finalize the path that needs to be
       setup.

   7.  Note that that the final decision can be made either in ACG or
       NCG depending on the mode of operation.  With application centric
       mode, minimal data center/IT resource information would flow from
       ACG to NCG while ACG collects network abstracted information from
       NCG to choose the optimal application-network resources.  With
       network centric mode, ACG would supply maximal data center/IT
       resource information to NCG so that NCG in conjunction with PCE
       would determine the optimal mixed set of application and network
       resources.  In the latter case, the PCE COULD support
       application/IT- based constrained computation capability beyond
       network path computation.  This requires further PCE capabilities
       to receive and process data center/IT resource information,
       possibly in conjunction with network information.

   cross stratum optimized path.

4.1.  Path Setup Using NMS

   After ACG and NCG have decided the path that needs to be set, NCG can
   send a request to NMS asking it relay the message to the head end LSR
   (also a PCC) to setup the pre computed path.  Once the path signaling
   is completed and the LSP is setup, PCC should relay the status of the
   LSP to the Statefull PCE.

   In this mechanism we can reuse the existing NMS to establish the
   path.  Any updates or deletion of such path would be made via the
   NMS.

   Head end LSR (PCC) 'H' is always the owner of the path.

   See Figure 6 for this scenario.

           Figure 7: Path Setup Using Centralized Control Plane

   After cross optimization, ACG and NCG will select the suitable end
   points, (the path is already calculated by PCE), this path is
   conveyed to the head end LSR which signals the path and notify the
   status to the Statefull PCE.  Later NCG can send suitable message to
   tear down the path.

   Using centralized control plane can make the NCG responsible for the
   LSP.  Head end LSR signals and maintains the status but the
   establishment and tear-down are initiated by the control plane.  This
   would have an obvious advantage in managing the setup paths.  The
   Statefull PCE will maintain the TED as well as the status of setup
   LSP.  NCG through centralized control plane can further setup/
   teardown/modify/re-optimize those paths.

4.3.  Path Setup using PCE

   A Statefull PCE extension MAY be developed to communicate the cross
   optimized path to the head end LSR.  Current PCEP protocol requires

   PCC to trigger Path request and PCE to provide reply.  Even in
   Statefull PCE, PCC must delegate the LSP to a PCE, a PCE never
   initiate path setup.  An extension to PCEP protocol MAY let PCE
   notify to PCC (Head end LSR) to establish the path.

   NCG via PCE and PCEP protocol can establish and tear-down LSP as
   shown in Figure 8.

                      Figure 9: Multi-domain Scenario

   [RFC5441] describes an inter-domain path computation with cooperating
   PCEs which can be enhanced and utilized in CSO enabled path
   computation.

5.1.2.  Multiple Application Domains with Multiple Network Domains

   Underlying network connecting the datacenters MAY be made up of
   multiple domains (AS and Area) as well as applications domains and
   ACG MAY be distributed.  In such case multiple ACG and NCG will be
   involved in cross optimizing.  This needs to be analyzed further.

5.1.2.1.  ACG talks to multiple NCGs

   As shown in Figure 10, ACG where the request originates may
   communicate with multiple NCG to get the network information from
   multiple domains to be cross optimized.

5.2.  Bottleneck

   In optical networks all PCE messages are sent over control channel,
   in Statefull PCE cases its observed that in case of a major link or
   node failure lot of PCEP messages are sent from all PCC to PCE.  This
   use lot of bandwidth of the control channel.

   PCE MAY become a common point of failure and bottleneck.  PCE/NCG/ACG
   failure as well as the link-failure disrupting connectivity could be
   highly disruptive to the system.

   The solution should focus on reducing such bottleneck.
