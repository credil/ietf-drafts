Abstract

   Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and TRILL are two emerging
   standards in the data center environment. While these two protocols
   are seemingly unrelated, they have a very similar behavior in the
   forwarding plane, as both perform hop-by-hop forwarding over
   Ethernet, modifying the packet's MAC addresses at each hop. This
   document describes an architecture for the integrated deployment of
   these two protocols.

1. Introduction

   Data center networks are rapidly evolving towards a consolidated
   approach, where Ethernet is used as the common infrastructure for all
   types of traffic. Storage traffic, which was traditionally dominated
   by the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol suite, is evolving towards Fibre
   Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), where native FC packets are
   encapsulated with an FCoE encapsulation over an Ethernet header.

   Traffic between two FCoE end nodes (ENodes) is forwarded through one
   or more FCoE Forwarders (FCF). An FCF takes a forwarding decision
   based on the Fibre Channel destination ID (D_ID), and enforces
   security policies between ENodes, also known as zoning. Once an FCF
   takes a forwarding decision, it modifies the source and destination
   MAC addresses of the packet, to reflect the path to the next hop FCF
   or ENode. FCFs use a routing protocol called Fabric Shortest Path
   First (FSPF) to find the optimal path to each destination. An FCF
   typically has one or more native Fibre Channel interfaces, allowing

   it to communicate with native Fibre Channel devices, e.g., storage
   arrays.

   TRILL [RFCTRILL] is a protocol for transparent least cost routing,
   where RBridges forward traffic to their detination based on a least
   cost route, using a TRILL encapsulation header. RBridges forward
   TRILL-encapsulated packets based on the Egress RBridge Nickname in
   the TRILL header. An RBridge forwards a TRILL-encapsulated packet
   after modifying its MAC addresses to reflect the path to the next-hop
   RBridge, and decrementing a Hop Count field.

   TRILL and FCoE bear a strong resemblance in their forwarding planes.
   Both protocols take a forwarding decision based on protocol addresses
   above Layer 2, and modify the Ethernet MAC addresses on a per-hop
   basis. Each of the protocols uses its own routing protocol rather
   than using any type of bridging protocol such as spanning tree
   protocol [802.1Q] or the Shortest Path Bridging protocol [802.1aq].

   FCoE and TRILL are both targeted at the data center environment, and
   their concurrent deployment is self-evident. This document describes
   an architecture for the integrated deployment of these two protocols.

3. FCoE over TRILL

3.1. FCoE over a TRILL Cloud

   The simplest approach for running FCoE traffic over a TRILL network
   is presented in Figure 1. The figure illustrates a TRILL-enabled
   network, where FCoE traffic is transparently forwarded over the TRILL
   cloud. The figure illustrates two ENodes, a Server and an FCoE
   Storage Array, an FCF, and a native Fibre Channel SAN connected to
   the FCF.

   FCoE traffic between the two ENodes is sent from the first ENode over
   the TRILL cloud to the FCF, and then back through the TRILL cloud to
   the second ENode.

                  Figure 1 The "Separate Cloud" Approach

   The configuration in Figure 1 separates the TRILL cloud(s) and the
   FCoE cloud(s). The TRILL cloud forwards FCoE traffic as standard
   Ethernet traffic, and appears to the ENodes and FCF as an Ethernet
   LAN.

   The main drawback of the Separate Cloud approach is that RBridges and
   FCFs are separate nodes in the network, resulting in more cabeling
   and boxes, and communication between Enodes usually requires two
   TRILL cloud traversals with twice as many hops. As mentioned above,
   data center networking is converging towards a consolidated and cost
   effective approach, where the same infrastructure and equipment is

   used for both data and storage traffic, and where high efficiency and
   minimal number of hops are important factors when designing the
   network topology.

3.2. FCoE over RBridge

3.2.1. FCRB

   Rather than the Separate Cloud approach discussed in the previous
   subsection, an alternate approach is presented, where each switch
   incorporates both an FCF entity and an RBridge entity. This
   consolidated entity is referred to as FCoE-forwarder-over-RBridge
   (FCRB).

   Figure 2 illustrates an FCRB, and its main building blocks. An FCRB
   can be functionally viewed as two independent entities:

   o An FCoE Forwarder (FCF) entity.

   o An RBridge entity.

   The FCF entity is connected to one of the ports of the RBridge, and
   appears to the RBridge as a native Ethernet host. A detailed
   description of the interaction between the layers is presented in
   Section 3.2.3.

                    Figure 2 FCRB Entity in the Network

   The FCRB entity maintains layer independence between the TRILL and
   FCoE protocols, while enabling both protocols on the same network.

   It is noted that FCoE traffic is always forwarded through an FCF, and
   cannot be forwarded directly between two ENodes. Thus, FCoE traffic
   between ENodes A and B in the topology in Figure 1 is forwarded
   through the path

   ENode A-->TRILL cloud-->FCF-->TRILL cloud-->ENode B

   Traffic between A and B in the topology in Figure 2 is forwarded
   through the path

   ENode A-->FCRB-->ENode B

   Hence, the usage of FCRB entities allows TRILL and FCoE to use common
   infrastructure and equipment, as opposed to the Separate Cloud
   topology presented in Figure 1.

3.2.2. Topology

   The network configuration illustrated in Figure 3 shows a typical
   topology of a data center network. Servers are hierarchically
   connected through Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches, and End-of-Row (EoR)
   racks. The EoR switches to other clouds, such as an external WAN, or
   a native FC SAN.

   Note that in the example in Figure 3 all the ToR and EoR switches are
   FCRB entities, but it is also possible for some of the network nodes
   to be pure RBridges, creating a topology where FCRBs are
   interconnected through TRILL clouds.

3.2.3. The FCRB Flow

   FCoE traffic sent between two ENodes, A and B, is transmitted through
   the ToR FCRB, since A and B are connected to the same ToR. Traffic
   between A and C must be forwarded through the EoR FCRB.

               Figure 4 Traffic between two ENodes - Example

   Figure 4 illustrates the traffic between ENodes A and C that are not
   connected to the same ToR.

   o FCoE traffic from A is sent to the ToR over the Ethernet
      interface.

   o The RBridge entity at the ToR forwards the packet to the FCF,
      analogous to forwarding between two Ethernet hosts.
      The FCF entity at the ToR takes a forwarding decision, and updates
      the destination MAC address of the packet to the address of the
      EoR FCF. The packet is then forwarded to the RBridge entity, where
      it is encapsulated in a TRILL header, and sent to the EoR FCRB.

   o The RBridge entity in the EoR FCRB, acting as the egress RBridge,
      decapsulates the TRILL header and forwards the FCoE packet to the
      FCF entity. The FCF takes a forwarding decision and updates the
      MAC address of the packet according to the next hop ToR. The
      packet is then forwarded to the RBridge and encapsulated with a
      new TRILL header.

   o At the ToR FCRB, the packet reaches the final egress RBridge, and
      the TRILL encapsulation is removed. The FCF then forwards the
      packet to the RBridge entity after updating its MAC addresses. The
      RBridge entity forwards the packet to the target ENode.

      Figure 5 Example Traffic between ENode & Native FC Storage Array

   Figure 5 illustrates traffic sent between an ENode and an FC Storage
   Array, following the network topology in Figure 3.

   o FCoE traffic from the ENode is sent to the ToR over the Ethernet
      interface.

   o The RBridge entity at the ToR forwards the packet to the FCF. The
      FCF entity at the ToR takes a forwarding decision and updates the
      destination MAC address of the packet to the address of the EoR
      FCF. The packet is then forwarded to the RBridge entity, where it
      is encapsulated in a TRILL header, and sent to the EoR FCRB.

   o The egress RBridge entity at the EoR FCRB decapsulates the TRILL
      header, and forwards the FCoE packet to the FCF entity. The packet
      is then forwarded as a native FC packet through the FC interface
      to the native FC node.
