1.  Introduction

   Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules [RFC5575], commonly known
   as BGP Flowspec, provided for a BGP Extended Community [RFC4360] that
   served to redirect traffic to a VRF routing instance that matched the
   flow specification NLRI.  In that RFC, the Redirect Extended
   Community was documented as follows:

   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   : | type   | extended community | encoding                 |
   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   : | 0x8008 | redirect           | 6-byte Route Target      |
   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
   :
   : [...]
   :
   : Redirect:  The redirect extended community allows the traffic to be
   : redirected to a VRF routing instance that lists the specified
   : route-target in its import policy.  If several local instances
   : match this criteria, the choice between them is a local matter
   : (for example, the instance with the lowest Route Distinguisher
   : value can be elected).  This extended community uses the same
   : encoding as the Route Target extended community [RFC4360].
   : [...]
   :
   : 11. IANA Considerations
   : [...]
   :
   : The following traffic filtering flow specification rules have been
   : allocated by IANA from the "BGP Extended Communities Type -
   : Experimental Use" registry as follows:
   : [...]
   :
   : 0x8008 - Flow spec redirect

   The IANA registry of BGP Extended Communities clearly identifies
   communities of specific formats.  For example, "Two-octet AS Specific
   Extended Community" [RFC4360], "Four-octet AS Specific Extended
   Community" [RFC5668] and "IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community"
   [RFC4360].  Route Targets [RFC4360] identify this format in the high-
   order (Type) octet of the Extended Community and set the value of the
   low-order (Sub-Type) octet to 0x02.  The Value field of the Route
   Target Extended Community is intended to be interpreted in the
   context of its format.

   Since the Redirect Extended Community only registered a single code-
   point in the IANA BGP Extended Community registry, a common
   interpretation of the Redirect Extended Community's "6-byte Route

   Target" has been to look for any matching Route Target sharing the
   same Value portion of its Extended Community.  Thus, multiple Route
   Targets provisioned in a router's VRFs might match even though the
   format was different.

   This "Value wildcard" behavior does not matched deployed
   implementations of BGP Flowspec.  Deployed implementations of BGP
   Flowspec use the following formatting for the Redirect Extended
   Community:

   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+
   | type   | extended community | encoding                            |
   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+
   | 0x8008 | redirect AS-2byte  | 2-octet AS, 4-octet Value           |
   | 0x8108 | redirect IPv4      | 4-octet IPv4 Address, 2-octet Value |
   | 0x8208 | redirect AS-4byte  | 4-octet AS, 2-octet Value           |
   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+

   It should be noted that the low-order nybble of the Redirect's Type
   field corresponds to the Route Target Extended Community format field
   (Type).  (See [RFC4360], Secs. 3.1, 3.2 and [RFC5668], Sec. 2.)  The
   low order octet (Sub-Type) of the Redirect Extended Community remains
   0x08, contrasted to 0x02 for Route Targets.


2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the "BGP Extended Communities Type -
   Experimental Use" registry as follows:

               0x8008 - Flow spec redirect AS-2byte
               0x8108 - Flow spec redirect IPv4
               0x8208 - Flow spec redirect AS-4byte


3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no additional security considerations than
   those already covered in [RFC5575].
