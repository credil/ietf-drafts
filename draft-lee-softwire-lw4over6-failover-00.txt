            Simple Failover Mechanism for Lightweight 4over6
                draft-lee-softwire-lw4over6-failover-00

Abstract

   This memo specifies a simple mechanism for Lightweight AFTR (lwAFTR)
   to notify Lightweight B4 (lwB4) to initiate the recreation of the
   binding when lwAFTR does not have the subscriber mapping in the
   mapping table.  This often happens at failover the backup lwAFTR does
   not have the subscriber mapping information to process the packets
   between lwB4 and external IPv4 host.

1.  Background

   Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] defines that
   Lightweight AFTR (lwAFTR) stores per subscriber binding.  The
   subscriber binding entry is usually created when the Lightweight B4
   (lwB4) successfully requested IPv4 resource from the provisioning
   system. lwAFTR could be in the provisioning path between lwB4 and the
   provisioning system.  This allows lwAFTR to listen to the
   provisioning messages and create the binding on demand.  The exact
   mechanism is out of scope.

   The AFTR's subscriber binding table is used to map the subscriber's
   IPv6 address to the IPv4 resource (i.e., full IPv4 address or

   restricted IPv4 address).  Due to security reason, entries in the
   table are usually created after a successful lwB4 provisioning.  This
   means the network knows the lwB4 and authorizes the lwAFTR to provide
   lightweight 4over6 services.  Consider when the primary lwAFTR
   failed, the Backup lwAFTR might not have the binding entry in the
   table because the Backup lwAFTR was not in the original provisioning
   path.  This requires the Backup lwAFTR to notify lwB4 to trigger
   provisioning request so that the Backup lwAFTR can create the binding
   entry.  This memo defines two simple mechanisms to let the Backup
   lwAFTR to create the subscriber binding after failover.

2.  Failover Use Case

   Consider a typical deployment model that a set of lwAFTRs were all
   provisioned with the same IPv6 anycast address.  When lwB4 booted up,
   it sent a dhcpv4 request over dhcpv6
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] to the primary lwAFTR (e.g.,
   lwAFTR1). lwAFTR1 created the subscriber binding and started
   providing lightweight 4over6 service.  At some point lwAFTR1 failed.
   Network converged and the Backup lwAFTR (e.g., lwAFTR2) became the
   active lwAFTR serving the lwB4s previously served by lwAFTR1.
   However, when lwAFTR2 received an IPv6 packet sourced from the lwB4,
   lwAFTR2 would fail to perform decapsulation and forward the IPv4
   packet because lwAFTR2 didn't have the subscriber binding in the
   table.

   In this use case there are four assumptions:

   1.  lwAFTR in the same failover group use the same IPv6 anycast
       address for the Softwire interface

   2.  The subscriber binding entry is created on-demand upon
       successfully lwB4 provisioning

   3.  IPv4 provisioning mechanism is dynamically required by the lwB4

   4.  IPv4 address used by the lwB4 is either static or dynamic

   In this memo, we only consider the failover scenario in deployments
   with these assumptions.  Other deployments such as using static
   provisioning are out of scope.

3.  Failover Setup Considerations

   To provide minimal impact to users during failover, there are some
   considerations:

   o  Backup lwAFTR Discovery

Internet-Draft              lw4over6 Failover                  July 2013


   o  lwB4 IPv4 Prefix Management

   o  lwB4 IPv4 Address Provisioning

3.1.  Backup lwAFTR Discovery Consideration

   During failover, fast service recovery relies on how fast the lwB4 to
   detect and discover the Backup lwAFTR.  In this memo, we suppose
   lwAFTR serving a failover group will all use the same IPv6 anycast
   address for the softwire interface.  When the Primary lwAFTR fails,
   lwB4 will rely on IP routing to discover the closest Backup lwAFTR.
   This mechanism does not require any pre-configuration in the lwB4.
   The time lwB4 to discover the Backup lwAFTR relies on how fast the
   routing protocol converges.

   lwAFTR must stop announcing the anycast address when it no longer
   provides lightweight 4over6 service.  This is critical to prevent
   lwB4's packets from reaching the failed lwAFTR.

3.2.  lwB4 IPv4 Prefix Management Consideration

   Given service agreement, some users may expect their IPv4 addresses
   will not change due to failover.  This is particular important for
   server applications which require to accept external connections
   using a given static IPv4 address.  Others may accept dynamic IPv4
   address which may change after failover.  In reality, an operator may
   have a mixed scheme for both static and dynamic IPv4 prefixes.  The
   business decision of IPv4 prefix management is out of scope of this
   memo.  However, the decision will have impact in failover design.

   For the same failover group, operators usually have two choices to
   manage the IPv4 prefix for lwAFTR:

      Case 1: Each lwAFTR is given different IPv4 prefixes

      Case 2: All lwAFTR are given identical IPv4 prefixes

   Case 1 supports dynamic IPv4 scenario. lwB4 does not require to use
   the same IPv4 address after failover.  Hence, both Primary and Backup
   lwAFTRs are advertising their own IPv4 prefixes.  When Backup lwAFTR
   receives a packet sourcing from an unknown IPv6 address (i.e., fail
   to find a match in the subscriber binding table), it will silently
   drop the packet.  Backup lwAFTR is not required to know the status of
   Primary lwAFTRs.  In fact, both Primary and Backup lwAFTRs are
   running autonomously.

   Case 2 supports the static IPv4 scenario. lwB4 expects the IPv4 will
   stay unchanged during failover.  When the Primary lwAFTR fails, the

Internet-Draft              lw4over6 Failover                  July 2013


   Backup lwAFTR will take over the IPv4 prefix and start accepting
   packets designated to that IPv4 prefix.  This requirement implies the
   following steps:

   1.  Primary and Backup lwAFTRs are running dynamic routing protocol

   2.  Primary lwAFTR set the routing matrix higher than the Backup
       lwAFTR does for the serving IPv4 prefix

   3.  When Primary detects problem, it stops advertising the IPv4
       prefix

   4.  Routing protocol converges and the Backup lwAFTR is the router
       announcing the IPv4 prefix

   The above steps requires the Primary and Backup lwAFTR must run
   dynamic routing protocol.  At any given time, only the serving lwAFTR
   is the next-hop router of the IPv4 prefix.  This implies the operator
   must manually configure the routing matrix of the IPv4 prefix so that
   the Backup lwAFTR will be the next-hop only if the Primary lwAFTR
   withdraws announcing the prefix.

   In both cases, when the Backup lwAFTR receives the IPv4 packet, the
   Backup lwAFTR must identify the lw4over6 B4 and send the packet to
   the lwB4.  This requires the Backup lwAFTR to know the subscriber
   binding.  Section 4 will discuss more in details.

3.3.  lwB4 IPv4 Address Provisioning

   When lwB4 starts up, it will need to acquire IPv4 resources.  There
   are multiple ways to acquire IPv4 address and restricted port-set.
   In this memo, we make no assumption how to obtain the IPv4 resources.
   Given a provisioning method, there are implications when failover
   occurs.  In this memo, we discuss failover impacts to DHCPv4-over-
   DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] and PCP
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-port-set].

3.3.1.  DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6

   Operator may use DHCPv4 to provision IPv4 address to the lwB4.  Since
   the access network is IPv6, the DHCPv4 messages must be encapsulated
   into DHCPv6 message to deliver between DHCP server and lwB4.  In a
   typical deployment, the DHCP server is a centralized DHCP server and
   lwAFTR is the DHCP relay agent to relay the dhcp messages to the
   server over unicast.  Rarely DHCP server will collocate with the
   lwAFTR to provision IPv4 resources to the lwB4.  We consider the
   collocated DHCP server is out of scope.

   DHCPv6 client uses a link-scoped multicast [RFC3315] to communicate
   with neighboring relay agents and servers.  If the Primary and Backup
   lwAFTRs are the lwB4's next-hop IPv6 routers, they must act as a
   dhcpv6 relay agent and listen to the DHCP multicast request.  If they
   are not the next-hop IPv6 router, the next-hop router must relay the
   dhcp packet over unicast to the lwAFTR's anycast address.  This will
   allow the Backup lwAFTR to receive the dhcp message and create the
   subscriber binding at failover.

3.3.2.  PCP

   In future version

4.  Failover Trigger Mechanisms

   For Control Message Trigger Failover, when a lwAFTR receives an IPv6
   packet from an unknown lwB4 from its tunnel interface, it sends an
   ICMP error message to the lwB4.  When lwB4 receives the ICMP error
   message, it must send the provisioning request to the network to
   trigger the subscriber entry creation in the lwAFTR.

   For Data Packet Trigger Failover, when a lwAFTR receives a packet
   which contains an unknown lwB4 from its tunnel interface, it must
   validate the source IPv4 address whether it is assigned by the
   provisioning system to the user.  The validation mechanism is
   deployment specific.  If the lwAFTR is next-hop of the lwB4, DHCP
   Lease Query may be used to validate the IPv4 address.  Other methods
   such as proprietary out-of-band verification may be used.  After
   successfully validation, lwAFTR will create the binding entry.

5.  Control Message Trigger Failover

5.1.  Tunnel Concentrator Behavior

   When lwAFTR receives a packet in its tunnel interface:

   1.  It must check its subscriber binding table against the IPv6
       source address of the encapsulated packet.

   2.  If an entry is found, forward the packet.

   3.  If an entry is not found, send an ICMPv6 Error Message (Type 1
       Code 0)

5.2.  Tunnel Initiator Behavior

   When lwB4 receives an ICMPv6 Error Message (Type 1 Code 0), it must
   start the provisioning mechanism to request IPv4 resource.

   lwB4 may be setup to receive external initiated sessions.  This is
   important for the lwB4 to periodically verify the binding entry in
   the lwAFTR.  Therefore, lwB4 must send packets (e.g. PING)
   periodically to the lwAFTR.

6.  Data Packet Trigger Failover

6.1.  Tunnel Concentrator Behavior

   When lwAFTR receives a packet in its tunnel interface:

   1.  It must check its subscriber binding table against the IPv6
       source address of the encapsulated packet.

   2.  If an entry is found, forward the packet.

   3.  If an entry is not found, extract the IPv4 source address from
       the encapsulated packet.

   4.  Validate the IPv4 address is the IPv4 address provisioned to the
       user.  The validation mechanism is out of scope.

   5.  Upon successful validation, create an entry in the subscriber
       binding table.

6.2.  Tunnel Initiator Behavior

   lwB4 is transparent to the failover. lwB4 will continue to send
   packets to the backup lwAFTR.

   lwB4 may be setup to receive external initiated sessions.  This is
   important for the lwB4 to periodically verify the binding entry in
   the lwAFTR.  Therefore, lwB4 must send packets (e.g. PING)
   periodically to the lwAFTR.
