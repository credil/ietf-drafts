Internet-Draft       Fragmentation of RADIUS packets            Feb 2012


1.  Introduction

   RADIUS [RFC2865] is a protocol for carrying authentication,
   authorization, and configuration information between a Network Access
   Server (NAS) which desires to authenticate its links and a shared
   Authentication Server (AS).  Information is exchanged between the NAS
   and the AS through packets.  Each RADIUS packet can transport several
   RADIUS attributes, to convey the necessary information to the other
   peer, up to a maximum size of 4 KB of total data (including RADIUS
   packet headers).  RADIUS attributes have a maximum size of 253 bytes
   of payload.

   RADIUS has been extensively used along the years.  Along this time,
   the need of sending RADIUS attributes larger than 253 bytes has
   become a reality.  An immediate alternative to overcome this issue
   consists in splitting the data into a group of RADIUS attributes of
   the same type, and then insert them into the RADIUS packet in order.
   At the destination, the content of these attributes is extracted and
   joined to rebuild the original data.  This scheme is followed, for
   example, by RADIUS-EAP [RFC3579].  A more advanced solution is given
   in [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions], where extended attributes can
   be marked with a flag to indicate fragmentation.  A reference-based
   mechanism is also proposed in [RFC6158], where attribute can be
   obtained through an out-of-band protocol.

   However, there are no proposals to deal with fragmentation at a
   packet level, when the total length exceeds the 4 KB limit imposed by
   the RADIUS specification.  As the usage of RADIUS is being considered
   in more complex AAA scenarios, including the exchange of richer data,
   like SAML assertions or JWT tokens, exceeding this limit becomes more
   likely, thus making necessary the availability of mechanisms for
   dealing with this situation.

   This document defines a mechanism to allow RADIUS peers to exchange
   packets that exceed the 4 KB limit, by fragmenting them across
   several exchanges.  This proposal tries to maintain compatibility
   with any intra-packet fragmentation mechanism and with the existing
   RADIUS deployments.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft       Fragmentation of RADIUS packets            Feb 2012


2.  Overview

   When a RADIUS peer needs to send a packet that exceeds the 4 KB, the
   following mechanism is used.  First, the large packet is split into
   several smaller RADIUS packets (i.e. chunks) of the same type (e.g.
   Access-Request).  The first chunk contains the first "n" RADIUS
   attributes of the original packet (in the same order), until a limit
   of 4092 bytes (4096 - 4) is reached.  It can be less, depending on
   the specific length of the attributes, but never more.  If there are
   still attributes from the original packet that have not been yet
   included into any chunk, a new attribute called More-Data-Pending is
   appended into the chunk.  This process is repeated until all the
   RADIUS attributes from the original packet have been included into
   some chunk.

   Then the first chunk is sent to the peer, which identifies the packet
   as a chunk (the More-Data-Pending attribute is present), and requests
   for the rest of the chunks.  Once all the chunks have been received
   by the peer, the original packet is reconstructed and processed as if
   it had been received in one piece.

   When a packet is truncated into chunks, a special situation may occur
   in combination with Extended Type attributes as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions].  If the truncation occurs in the
   middle of a fragmented attribute, the last attribute of the chunk
   will be an Extended Type with Flags, with flag M enabled.  This
   situation is specifically forbidden in
   [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions].  To indicate that this situation
   is provoked by a truncation and hence MUST be allowed, a new flag "T"
   (indicating truncation) MUST be set into that Extended-Type-Flag
   attribute.  The combination of the flags "M" and "T" indicates that
   the attribute is fragmented (flag M), but that all the fragments are
   not available in this chunk (flag T).

   Indeed, this situation will be the most usual.  When packet
   fragmentation is required, usually it will be motivated by the
   inclusion of one or more large attribute that makes use of attribute
   fragmentation.  Hence, the truncation will probably split the large
   attribute into two (or more) pieces.  The rest of possibilities,
   where the truncation point does not split a fragmented attribute,
   does not require any special treatment.


3.  More-Data-Pending attribute

   This document proposes the definition of a new extended type
   attribute, called More-Data-Pending.  The format of this attribute
   follows the indications of an Extended Type attribute defined in

Internet-Draft       Fragmentation of RADIUS packets            Feb 2012


   [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions].  The presence of this attribute
   indicates that the received RADIUS packet is not complete (i.e. it is
   a chunk), and more data MUST be received to regenerate the original
   packet.  The following figure represents the format of the More-Data-
   Pending attribute.

   This attribute MAY be present in Access-Request and Acess-Challenge
   packets.  It MUST not be included in Acess-Accept packets.


4.  Fragmentation of Access-Request packets

   When the NAS desires to send a RADIUS packet that exceeds the 4 KB
   limit, the packet can be split into smaller packets (chunks) and sent
   over different exchanges.  This fact is indicated by including a
   More-Data-Pending attribute on each chunk (except the last one of the
   series).  The process is described in detail using the following
   example.  In this example, the attributes "Data" and "Other" are
   Extended Type with Flags, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-radext-radius-extensions].

   In order to make the example simpler, it is assumed that each RADIUS
   packet can include up to 8 RADIUS attributes, instead of using bytes.
   Flag M is indicated as [M].  Flag T is indicated as [T].  Presence of

   both is indicated as [MT].  Data1, Data2, Data3... indicate
   successive fragments of the attribute "Data".

   o  The RADIUS client wants to send the following RADIUS packet:

         Access-Request = User-Name, Calling-Station-Id, Data1[M],
         Data2[M], Data3[M], Data4[M], Data5[M], Data6[M], Data7[M],
         Data8[M], Data9[M], Data10, Other1[M], Other2[M], Other3

   o  As the RADIUS packet exceeds the maximum allowed length (8
      attributes), the RADIUS client truncates the packet to generate
      the first chunk, including the More-Data-Pending attribute.  Flag
      "T" is activated into the fragment "Data5", as it is the last of
      the packet (chunk), but not the last of the fragmented attribute.

         Access-Request-1 = User-Name, Calling-Station-Id, Data1[M],
         Data2[M], Data3[M], Data4[M], Data5[MT], More-Data-Pending

   o  When the server receives the RADIUS packet containing the More-
      Data-Pending attribute, the processing of the packet is delayed
      until all the pending data is received.  The pending data is
      requested by means of an Access-Challenge packet, using the State
      attribute to tie together this response with the subsequent
      request from the client.

         Access-Challenge-1 = State1

   o  The client continues including attributes until another RADIUS
      packet (i.e. chunk) is completed, appending again the More-Data-
      Pending attribute.  The State attribute received in the Access-
      Challenge is also included in this chunk.  Again, flag "T" is
      enabled in the last fragment of the chunk to indicate that a
      truncation took place.

         Acess-Request-2 = State1, Data6[M], Data7[M], Data8[M],
         Data9[M], Data10, Other1[MT], More-Data-Pending

   o  As the received request contains the More-Data-Pending, the server
      stores the attributes into the state associated to State1 and
      replies with another Access-Challenge.  The challenge contains a
      new State attribute that refers to this conversation.

         Access-Challenge-2 = State2

   o  Finally, the client sends the last chunk of the original packet,
      including the received State attribute.

         Access-Request-3 = State2, Other2[M], Other3

   o  On reception of this last chunk (no More-Data-Pending attribute
      present), the server can process the totality of the received
      attributes as if they all had been received into a single RADIUS
      packet larger than 4 KB.

5.  Fragmentation of Access-Challenge packets

   When is the server (AS) the one who wants to send a large RADIUS
   packet, the solution is very similar to the previous one.  The one
   difference is that in this scenario, the AS includes a State
   attribute along with the More-Data-Required.

   The following figure depicts how the message exchange would be if the
   AS wanted to send a large packet to the NAS.  Specifically, it wants
   to send the following challenge:

6.  Fragmentation of Access-Accept packets

   If the AS wants to send an Access-Accept packet that exceeds the 4 KB
   limit, the operation is slightly different.  As some attributes are
   allowed to appear in Access-Accept packets, but not in Access-
   Challenge packets, the solution described in the previous sections is
   not directly applicable.  Instead, the AS MUST send an Access-Accept
   packet to the NAS containing all the attributes that can not be
   included in Access-Challenge packets, and indicating "Authorize-Only"
   as the Service-Type.  The additional attributes are received via a
   series of Access-Request/Access-Challenge exchanges, as described in
   the previous section.  Finally, the last packet from the AS to the
   NAS would be an Access-Accept containing the real Service-Type for
   the user.  For simpliciy, Service-Type[X] indicates a Service-Type
   attribute of value X.

   o  The AS wants to send the following Access-Accept packet:

         Access-Accept = User-Name, Service-Type[X], Framed-IP-Address,
         Data1[M], Data2[M], Data3[M], Data4[M], Data5[M], Data6[M],
         Data7[M], Data8[M], Data9[M], Data10

   o  As the RADIUS packet exceeds the maximum allowed length (8
      attributes), the AS truncates the packet to generate the first
      chunk.  This chunk only includes the attributes that cannot be
      included in Access-Challenge packets.  In this example they are
      the User-Name, the Service-Type and the Framed-IP-Address.  The
      Service-Type is changed to "Authorize-Only", and a State attribute
      is included.

         Access-Accept-1 = User-Name, Service-Type[Authorize-Only],
         Framed-IP-Addres, State1

   o  When the NAS receives the Access-Accept, it determines, based on
      the Service-Type=Authorize-Only, that an additional exchange is
      required.  Thus, it generates a new Access-Request packet
      containing the received State attribute.

         Access-Request-1 = State1

   o  The AS then generates a new chunk with part of the remaining
      attributes to be sent.  As they do not fit into a single chunk, a
      More-Data-Pending attribute and a new State attribute are also
      included.

         Access-Challenge-1 = Data1[M], Data2[M], Data3[M], Data4[M],
         Data5[M], Data6[MT], More-Data-Pending, State2

   o  The NAS determines the received packet is part of a larger one
      (i.e. it is a chunk) due to the presence of the More-Data-Pending
      attribute, hence it requests the rest of the data by sending a new
      Access-Request packet including the received State attribute.

         Access-Request-2 = State2

   o  Finally, the AS includes the rest of the attributes into the final
      Access-Accept packet.  This packet also includes the original
      Service-Type for the user.

         Access-Accept-2 = Data7[M], Data8[M], Data9[M], Data10,
         Service-Type[X]

   o  On reception of this last packet, the NAS can process the totality
      of the received attributes as if they all had been received into a
      single RADIUS packet larger than 4 KB.

   The following figure depicts the exchange of chucks between the NAS
   and the AS.
