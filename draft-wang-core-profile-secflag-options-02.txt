Internet-Draft      CoAP Profile and Sec-flag Options       October 2012


1.  Introduction

   CoAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for machine-to-machine
   applications such as smart energy and building automation using with
   constrained nodes and networks.  This memo adds two new options for
   CoAP: Profile and Sec-flag.

   The main purpose of the Profile Option is indicating the
   identification of an application using CoAP, by reading this option
   some intermediaries (e.g. proxy) and transport networks could
   distinguish different applications and do some differentiated
   processing.

   The Sec-flag Option complements the security considerations, enabling
   NoSec pattern in a segment of the communication path between the
   client and server, by taking care of establishing and maintaining
   lower layer security instead of DTLS in these intermediate networks.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Motivations

   CoAP is a light-weight web protocol and can be used in constrained
   devices, fulfilling machine-to-machine requirements.  Because of its
   features, more and more M2M applications MAY adopt CoAP.

2.1.  Profile Option Extension

   CoAP applications SHOULD use an operator's network as the transport
   bearer.  Different machine-to-machine applications MAY have different
   Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in terms of required bit rates
   as well as acceptable packet delays and packet loss rates.  When
   application data is transmitted through the transport network, the
   network MAY need to identify different machine-to-machine services to
   do some differentiated processing, applying different control
   policies with subscriptions.  Before applying control policies to
   applications, transport networks SHOULD identify them and distinguish
   each one from another referring to application identification, and
   then networks MAY apply different policies to different applications.
   Some intermediaries (e.g.CoAP proxy) MAY also would like to
   distinguish different applications and do some differentiated
   processing such as caching and forwarding application data in
   different priorities.

Internet-Draft      CoAP Profile and Sec-flag Options       October 2012


   This memo describes the extensions to CoAP and is to provide
   expanding proposal(s) to fulfill the motivations and requirements,
   defining an additional Option for the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP): Profile.  The Profile Option is defined as the
   identification of CoAP applications.  When CoAP messages are
   transmitted through the transport network, network entities MAY use
   some technologies to read the Option Value to identify the
   application, and then apply control policies with the subscription of
   application owner.

2.2.  Sec-flag Option Extension

   The transmission path between the client and server MAY consist of
   some segments: Network domain based on existing standards 3GPP,
   TISPAN, IETF, etc., and M2M Device and Gateway Domain based on
   existing standards and technologies like DLMS, CEN, CENELEC,PLT,
   Zigbee, M-BUS, KNX, etc.  The application data MAY be transmitted
   through different networks between the client and server.

   The basic CoAP protocol defines the DTLS binding.  DTLS would add a
   per-datagram overhead and some initialization vectors.  For some
   constrained networks and nodes, this is really expensive.  And
   intermediate network domain MAY have some independent and reliable
   security standards (e.g.  ZigBee standard).  In some cases, CoAP
   could use these security standards instead of DTLS to avoid DTLS
   overhead in some intermediate networks.In these network domains DTLS
   may be disabled but be retained in other domains.

   As an example, the ZigBee standard for sensor networks defines a
   security architecture based on an online trust center and uses CCM*
   model to secure applications.  This standard can fulfill the security
   requirements of CoAP.  That is to say, CoAP applications could be
   secured by lower layer security, so in this network DTLS could be
   disabled to avoid DTLS datagram overhead.  We just mark a security
   flag to indicate that CoAP data is secured by lower layer instead in
   this network domain and the overhead would be much less.  And in the
   Transport Network domain we still establish DTLS security.  Thus we
   MAY enable two different security patterns described in
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap] in different segments between the client and
   server.

   The Sec-flag Option can be used to indicate the security information
   and ensure the integrality of the security mechanism.


3.  Profile Option

Internet-Draft      CoAP Profile and Sec-flag Options       October 2012


3.1.  Profile Option Definition

       +-----+----------+--------+-------------+---------+---------+
       | No. | C/E      | Name   | Format      | Length  | Default |
       +-----+----------+--------+-------------+---------+---------+
       | 2n  | Elective |Profile |(see below)  | 4B      | (none)  |
       +-----+----------+--------+-------------+---------+---------+


   The Profile Option indicates the identification of CoAP applications.
   Transport network entities MAY use some technologies to read the
   Option Value and then apply corresponding treatment.

   This option is "elective" and the Option Number is even.  It MUST NOT
   occur more than once.

   The detailed definitions and encoding SHOULD refer to the description
   of Option Format in [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   Option Value consists of Enterprise Number, Application ID and
   Priority.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |       Enterprise   Number     |        Application ID     |Pri|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                       Figure 1: Option Value Format

   As shown in Figure 1, Enterprise Number is the register number of
   application owners (e.g. traffic management agencies) in network
   operators.  Application ID is the identification of the owner's
   application which subscribes transport and communication services
   from operators.  Priority (Pri) indicates the priority of application
   data, data of the same application MAY has different priority (For
   some cost reasons, application owners MAY subscribe low priority for
   some application data).

   The SDNV[RFC5050] encoding can be used.

   We can distinguish different applications with a combination of
   Enterprise Number, Application ID and Priority.

3.1.1.  Option Value Length

   In actual usages, the number of CoAP application owners MAY be out of
   length range indicated by 2 bytes, the default length cannot fulfill
   requirements.  Hence, we can define another Option Value Length:
   5bytes.

Internet-Draft      CoAP Profile and Sec-flag Options       October 2012


   In the initialization phase of CoAP message, the Option Value Length
   SHOULD be determined.

3.2.  Using the Profile Option

   The semantics of Option Value are defined by prior agreement between
   the application owners and network operators.  Some encryption
   algorithms MAY be used.  Network entities MAY also apply some
   validation policies when reading the Option Value.

   CoAP application owners MAY realize functions through a M2M
   communication for some purposes (e.g.  Meter readings) at their
   customer's premises.  The Profile Option can be contained in the
   application message to indicate the identity.

   When CoAP messages across transport network, network entities MAY use
   some technologies such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to read the
   Profile Option Value and report it to policy control decision
   function entities.  And then policy control decision function
   entities determine the policies applied to CoAP data as well as
   establishing dedicated bearers.

3.3.  Example

   In some M2M environments, the nodes access to Internet through 3GPP
   network.

   This example (Figure 2) shows that mobile network is the bearer
   between two M2M end-points.  These end-points MAY belong to an
   electric power company and this M2M application is a meter reading
   service.  The profile option value of this application is 0x12111111.

             +------+  CoAP-REQ +----------+ CoAP-REQ +------+
             |      | --------> |  MOBILE  | -------> |      |
             |  A   |           |          |          |   B  |
             |      | <-------- |  NETWORK | <------- |      |
             +------+  CoAP-RES +----------+ CoAP-RES +------+


                            Figure 2 An example

   The message flow is shown in Figure 3.  At first the requester
   (server) sends a request which MAY be a device trigger that makes end
   devices return electricity records.  The number of end devices is
   numerous and this triggering MAY happen in a preset period of time.
   All devices return their records at the approximately same time, and
   the data transmission volume is huge.  Hence it is expected that the
   network SHOULD offer QoS guarantee (such as high bandwidth and

   throughput) for the M2M application.

   The requester SHOULD initial the Profile Option when sending a
   request.  Network entities can read the Option Value and know that
   the application is a meter reading service belonging to a certain
   electricity company.  And then specialized policies MUST be applied.
   The Profile option value MUST be echoed in the messages from
   recipients.

   When the M2M application data comes into the network, network
   entities MUST provide corresponding policy control with subscriptions
   and MAY also establish dedicated bearers assign dedicated network
   resources to ensure the quality of transport and communication if
   necessary.

4.  Sec-flag Option

   The Sec-flag Option complements the security considerations, enabling
   NoSec pattern in one or more segments of the communication path
   between the client and server.

4.1.  Security Negotiation

   Before establishing a security session between endpoints, the
   negotiation SHOULD be made.  As shown in Figure 4, the basic model
   includes three actors: a client, a proxy and a server.

                           Figure 4 Basic model

   (1) Lower security can secure CoAP application data

   At first, the client sends to the server a hello message in which the
   Sec-flag Option with an empty value is included.  The proxy is
   requested to forward the request or serve it, and return the
   response.  If the network domain between the client and proxy could
   guarantee the lower layer security, the proxy SHOULD set the Sec-flag
   Option with a valid value and transfer the hello message to the
   server.

   When the server receives the message, it MUST respond with a server
   hello-verify message.  A response with the same valid option value as
   the value set in the proxy SHOULD be returned only if the server
   trusts the lower layer security between the client and proxy.  If the
   server accepts the lower layer security, DTLS would be disabled
   between the client and proxy and then the proxy SHOULD make a DTLS
   handshake with the server to make up a DTLS security session.
   Otherwise, the DTLS handshake SHOULD be made between the client and
   server, that would be introduced in the following.

   (2) Lower security cannot secure CoAP application data

   When the server receives the Hello message, if the server does not
   trust the lower layer security between the client and proxy, the
   server would respond a hello-verify message containing an empty

   Security option and an error code.  Then the client would send DTLS
   handshake messages to the server and establish DTLS between the
   client and the server.

   (3) There is no lower security between the client and M2M Gateway

   Figure 5 There is no lower security in the Device and Gateway Domain

   If the network domain between the client and proxy could not
   guarantee lower layer security, the proxy SHOULD return an
   appropriate error response code with an empty Security Option as
   shown in Figure 5.  Then the client would send DTLS handshake
   messages to the server and establish DTLS between the client and the
   server.

   In all the situations, the client and the proxy also need initialize
   lower security mechanism, which MAY happen either before the Security
   Option negotiation or after it.

4.2.  Using the Sec-flag Option in data transport

   When the security negotiation is completed, a security session is
   established between the client and server.

   The Sec-flag Option MUST be included in messages sent by the client
   and the value SHOULD be empty.  When the proxy receives the message,
   it MUST set the Sec-flag Option with a valid value and transfer the
   message to the server.  The Sec-flag Option indicates that the
   message comes from a reliable network domain and the server could
   trust it.  And then the server would respond the request.  The same
   Sec-flag Option SHOULD be echoed in the response.  When the response

   comes to the proxy, the proxy reads the option and knows that the
   message SHOULD be secured by lower layer security.

4.3.  Sec-flag Option Definition

       +-----+----------+--------+-------------+---------+---------+
       | No. | C/E      | Name   | Format      | Length  | Default |
       +-----+----------+--------+-------------+---------+---------+
       | 2n+1| Critical |Sec-flag|(see below)  | 1B      | (empty) |
       +-----+----------+--------+-------------+---------+---------+


   The Sec-flag Option is used for indicating the lower layer security.

   This option is "critical" and the Option Number is odd.

   The detailed definitions and encoding SHOULD refer to the description
   of Option Format in [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  The value is made up of
   security indication.

   The SDNV[RFC5050] encoding can be used.

   network.  DTLS is enabled between M2M Gateway and application server,
   and in Zigbee network DTLS is disabled and lower layer security
   secures CoAP applications.  M2M Gateway, working as a "marker", sets
   the Sec-flag option to show that the data from Zigbee network domain
   is secured and reliable in the uplink and indicate that the data need
   low layer security and DTLS SHOULD be disabled in the Zigbee network
   domain in the downlink.  As the intermediate gateway, M2M Gateway
   needs to transfer the data to each network and adapt the security
   standard to the other one.  M2M Gateway also needs to check the

   gateway checks whether the Sec-flag option is set by the end devices
   illegally (the default value SHOULD be empty).  If the Sec-flag
   option is not empty, the gateway SHOULD drop it, else the gateway
   SHOULD set the valid value and transfer the message.
