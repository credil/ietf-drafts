This document introduces the concept of Virtual Local Area Network
(VLAN) aggregation as it relates to IPv4 address allocation.
A mechanism is described by which hosts that reside in the same
physical switched infrastructure, but separate virtual broadcast
domains, are addressed from the same IPv4 subnet and share a common
default gateway IP address, thereby removing the requirement of a
dedicated IP subnet for each virtual Local Area Network (LAN) or
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).
 
Employing such a mechanism significantly decreases IPv4 address
consumption in virtual LANs and MANs.  It may also ease
administration of IPv4 addresses within the network.
