1. Introduction 

   [RFC5520] defines the concept of a Path Key.  This object can be 
   used by a Path Computation Element (PCE) in place of a segment of a 
   path that it wishes to keep confidential. The Path Key can be 
   signaled in Resource ReSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-
   TE) protocol by placing it in an Explicit Route Object (ERO) as 
   described in [RFC5553]. 
    
   When establishing a set of LSPs to provide protection services 
   [RFC4427], it is often desirable that the LSPs should take different 
   paths through the network. This can be achieved by path computation 
   entities that have full end-to-end visibility, but it is more 
   complicated in multi-domain environments when segments of the path 
   may be hidden so that they are not visible outside the domain they 
   traverse. 
    
   This document describes how the Path Key object can be used in the 
   RSVP-TE eXclude Route Object (XRO), and the Explicit eXclusion Route 
   subobject (EXRS) of the ERO in order to facilitate path hiding, but 
   allow diverse end-to-end paths to be established in multi-domain 
   environments.

1.1. Example Use 

   Figure 1 shows a simple network with two domains. It is desired to 
   set up a pair of path-disjoint LSPs from the source in Domain 1 to 
   the destination in Domain 2, but the domains keep strict 
   confidentiality about all path and topology information.  
    
   The first LSP will be signaled by the source with ERO {A, B, loose 
   Dst} and will be set up with the path {Src, A, B, U, V, W, Dst}. But 
   when sending the RRO out of Domain 2, node U would normally strip 
   the path and replace it with a loose hop to the destination. With 
   this limited information, the source is unable to include enough 
   detail in the ERO of the second LSP to avoid it taking, for example, 
   the path {Src, C, D, X, V, W, Dst} which is not path-disjoint. 
    
   In order to improve the outcome, node U can replace the path segment 
   {U, V, W} in the RRO with a Path Key. The Path Key Object assigns an 
   identifier to the key and also indicates that it was node U that 
   made the replacement. 
    
   With this additional information, the source is able to signal the 
   second LSP with ERO set to {C, D, exclude Path Key, loose Dst}. When 
   the signaling message reaches node X, it can consult node U to 
   expand the Path Key and so know to avoid the path of the first LSP. 
   Alternatively, the source could use an ERO of {C, D, loose Dst} and 
   include an XRO containing the Path Key.

2. RSVP-TE Extensions 

   This section defines the subobject that can be either in the XRO 
   object or Explicit eXclusion Route subobject (EXRS) as defined in 
   [RFC4874]. 

2.1. Path Key Subobject (PKS) 

   The IPv4 PKS has the following format: 

   0                   1                   2                   3 
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |L|    Type     |     Length    |           Path Key            | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                     PK-owner-ID (4 bytes)                     | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   The meaning of the field L bit, Length, Path Key is defined in 
   [RFC4874].  

   Type: sub-object type for XRO Path Key; TBD. 

   PK-owner-ID: The IPv4 address of a node that assigned the Path Key 
   identifier and that can return an expansion of the Path Key or use 
   the Path Key as an exclusion in a path computation. 

   Similarly, the format of IPv6 PKS is as follows: 

   0                   1                   2                   3 
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |L|    Type     |     Length    |           Path Key            | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                    PK-owner-ID (16 bytes)                     | 
   |                                                               | 
   |                                                               | 
   |                                                               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
2.2. PKS Processing Rules  

   The exclude route list is encoded as a series of subobjects 
   contained in an EXCLUDE_ROUTE object or an EXRS of the ERO.  The 
   procedure defined in [RFC4874] for processing XRO and EXRS is not 
   changed by this document.

draft-zhang-ccamp-pathkey-00.txt                         September 2013 


   Irrespective of the L flag, if the node, receiving the PKS, cannot 
   recognize the subobject, it will react according to [RFC4874] and 
   SHOULD ignore the constraint.  

   Otherwise, if it cannot find a route/route segment meeting the 
   constraint: 

        -if L flag is set to 0, it will react according to [RFC4874] and 
        SHOULD send a PathErr message with the error code/value 
        combination ''Routing Problem'' / ''Route Blocked by Exclude Route''. 

        -if L flag is set to 1, which means the node SHOULD try to be as 
        much diversified as possible with the specified resource. If it 
        cannot fully support the constraint, it SHOULD send a PathErr 
        message with the error code/value combination "Notify Error" / 
        "Fail to find diversified path" (TBD). 

   This mechanism can work together with the presence of a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) or if the local node generates the PK 
   itself. Note that other mechanisms to use or expand the PK are out 
   of scope of this document. 

3. Security Considerations 

   The use of path keys proposed in this draft allows nodes to hide 
   parts of the path as it is signaled. This can be used to improve the 
   confidentially of the LSP setup. Moreover, it may serve to improve 
   security of the control plane for the LSP as well as data plane 
   traffic carried on this LSP. However, the benefits of using path key 
   are lost unless there is an appropriate access control of any tool 
   that allows expansion of the path key. 

4. IANA Considerations 

4.1. New Subobject Type 

   IANA registry: RSVP PARAMETERS 
   Subsection: Class Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types 
    
   This document introduces two new subobjects for the EXCLUDE_ROUTE      
   object [RFC4874], C-Type 1. 
       

   Subobject Type                        Subobject Description

   Note well: [RFC5520] defines the PKS for use in PCEP.  The above 
   number suggestions for use in RSVP-TE follow that assigned for the 
   PKS in PCEP [RFC5520].  

4.2. New Error Code 

   IANA registry: RSVP PARAMETERS 

   Subsection: Error Codes and Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-Codes 

   New Error Values sub-codes have been registered for the Error Code 
   'Notify Error' (25).
